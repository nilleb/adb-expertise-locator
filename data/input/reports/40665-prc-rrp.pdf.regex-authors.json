A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  circulated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nalong with two environmental management plans on 11 July 2008, and \nuploaded to the ADB website on 11 July 2008.  \n   \nProject  The Project is a key urban environmental improvement initiative of the Jilin \nDescription  provincial government (JPG), and the Heilongjiang provincial government \n(HPG) to control pollution in the Songhua River Basin (SRB). It is classified \nas a targeted intervention because it contributes to achieving Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7, Target 10, which calls for the halving of the proportion \nof people without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation by \n2015.  The  Project  will  help  to  (i)  reduce  water  pollution, \n(ii)  protect  water  resources,  (iii)  address  water  shortages  (by  recycling \neffluent) and meet the demand for high-quality treated water through 2015, \n(iv)  control  nonpoint  source  pollution  through  effective  solid  waste \nmanagement (SWM), (v) promote sustainable economic development, and \n(vi) improve the environment and living conditions in the project counties \nand cities (see footnotes 9 and 10 in the main text) in Jilin and Heilongjiang \nprovinces. The Project has three components, five subcomponents, and 20 \nactivities. The components are (i) an improved and expanded water supply \nand wastewater services in 11 counties and cities in Heilongjiang province; \n(ii) improved and expanded wastewater facilities and SWM in 15 counties \nand cities in Jilin province; and (iii) capacity development and training on \nproject management, institutional and SWM and wastewater management, \nand tariff reform for all the project implementing agencies (IAs). The Project \nsupports the Government\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) which includes the \ngoals  of  improving  living  conditions  and  health  in  cities  and  promoting \nsustainable economic development. It also supports the Songhua River \nBasin Water Pollution Prevention and Control Master Plan (SRBPCMP), \nwhich calls for improving water quality in the SRB from the current class IV, \nV and below V to class III by 2020.  \n \nThe proposed Project catalyzes both government and private investments \naimed at reducing pollution in the SRB. The ADB East Asia Department \n(EARD)  and  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  are \nadopting  a  public\u2013private  partnership  approach  to  address  the  large \nwastewater treatment funding needs of Heilongjiang Province. PSOD is \npreparing a project for the Tsinghua Tongfang Water Engineering Company \nLimited  (TTWE)  which  is  currently  managing  the  largest  wastewater ", " ii \ntreatment plant in Harbin. The PSOD project would support TTWE through \nthe provision of equity of $12 million, or 20% of equity capital, whichever is \nlower, and loans for the management of wastewater treatment plants in \nother cities in Heilongjiang. TTWE is focusing on the water and wastewater \nsector  business  and  is  exploring  private\u2013public  participation  (PPP) \nopportunities with the local governments. Through an equity investment of \n$3.4 million, TTWE is a minority shareholder in the Qitaihe City Central \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and effluent reuse subproject included \nin the proposed Project. This subproject will be financed by the ADB loan, \nlocal government counterpart funds, and private sector funds. The TTWE \ninvestment would (i) solve the funding shortage at Qitaihe, and (ii) improve \nthe  management  and  operational  efficiency  at  Qitaihe  through  training \nprovided by TTWE. This pilot demonstration subproject could be replicated \nin other subprojects in Heilongjiang, and then in Jilin province.   \n \nThe proposed Project would significantly increase the wastewater treatment \ncapacity in medium-sized and small cities and counties in Heilongjiang and \nJilin provinces. ADB is also conducting a study on nonsovereign lending in \nurban infrastructure development in the PRC. The public\u2013private sector \napproach to the wastewater treatment sector could be replicated in Jilin \nprovince and elsewhere in the PRC. HPG and JPG plan to invest $1.655 \nbillion to increase wastewater treatment capacity and reduce pollution in the \nSonghua River in the 11th FYP. The proposed Project accounts for 23% of \nthis effort, demonstrating its strong catalytic impact in mobilizing resources \naimed at SRB pollution control. \n   \nRationale  The project counties and cities of Heilongjiang province (with an urban \npopulation of 7.04 million) and Jilin province (an urban population of 2.90 \nmillion) are located along the SRB. The SRB is the third largest river basin \nin the PRC, and it covers sections of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and \nthe autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. The Songhua River is severely \npolluted with organic chemicals, heavy metals, and conventional pollutants, \nand  this  constrains  sustainable  economic  development  in  the  region. \nUnderdevelopment of wastewater collection and treatment in the project \ncounties and cities in Heilongjiang province and Jilin province leads to \nuntreated wastewater being discharged into local rivers, and eventually to \nthe pollution of the SRB. Water quality in some sections of the Songhua \nRiver and its tributaries does not meet class V of the PRC Surface Water \nQuality Standard. The lack of adequate wastewater management degrades \nlocal rivers, poses a threat to public health, and adversely affects the quality \nof life in the project counties and cities. Those in Heilongjiang province rely \nprimarily on surface water for their water supply. Under normal conditions, \nwater demand is expected to exhaust developed capacity in the project \ncounties and cities by 2010. These counties and cities experienced supply \nproblems  during  a  severe  episode  of  drought  in  2004,  leading  to \ndangerously  low  water  levels  in  the  reservoirs  and  a  resulting  loss  of \neffective treatment plant capacity. They also experienced low pressure and \nsupply interruptions. The project counties and cities in Jilin province have \ndomestic  SWM  featuring  domestic  waste  pick-up,  extensive  informal \nrecovery of recyclables, and disposal in a managed landfill. Given that \nexisting landfill sites will be fully utilized within 2 years, construction of new \n   ", "iii \nfacilities  is  urgently  needed.  The  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to \ncontrol of water pollution in the local rivers and in the SRB. It will also help \nsolve the current water shortage problems in the project cities and meet the \nfuture demand for high-quality treated water. \n  \n  In  2002,  during  the  processing  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project \n($100 million), ADB had extensive discussions with the Government on \naddressing pollution control in the SRB. Consequently, ADB provided a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project  for  the  Songhua  River  Basin  Water \nQuality and Pollution Control Management. The TA, which was considered \nhighly successful, provided strategic policy inputs to the SRBPCMP. The \nSRBPCMP is a Government-approved action program that sets pollution \ncontrol  targets  from  2006  to  2010  and  is  designed  to  control  urban \nenvironmental pollution and ecological damage by 2010.  \n \nThe  Jilin  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Development  (JWSSD)  Project \n($100  million),  approved  in  2005,  was  the  first  major  ADB  investment \ndirectly addressing pollution control in SRB. The Jilin Urban Environmental \nImprovement  (JUEI)  Project  ($100  million),  approved  in  2007  was  the \nsecond, and follows the priority list of SRBPCMP. The proposed Project, \nwith an indicative ADB loan of $200 million, will be the third major ADB \ninvestment in the SRB, and follows the priority list of SRBPCMP. A \u201cleading \ngroup\u201d  with  members  from  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission;  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection;  Ministry  of  Water \nResources; and the provincial governments of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Inner \nMongolia, is responsible for overseeing the preparation and implementation \nof the SRBPCMP. The proposed Project will complement the SRB pollution \ncontrol efforts underway through the ongoing JWSSD and JUEI projects. \nThis comprehensive strategic approach to addressing pollution control in \nthe SRB will serve as a model for demonstration and replication elsewhere \nin the PRC. \n   \nImpact and  The Project will enhance the urban environment and improve public health \nOutcome  and the quality of life for urban residents in the project cities and counties in \nthe provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. This will be achieved by increasing \nwastewater treatment coverage, enhancing SWM, and improving the supply \nof potable water. The outcome of the Project will be less pollution and \nbetter water supply, wastewater management, and SWM in the SRB.  \n \nCost Estimates  The investment cost of the project is estimated at $396.3 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $11.06 million. \n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  ", " iv \nFinancing Plan \n  Amount   \nSource  ($ million equivalent)  % of Total \nAsian Development Bank  200.0  50.5 \nState bonds, Heilongjiang  46.4  11.6 \nLocal government equity, Heilongjiang  44.6  11.3 \nState bonds, Jilin  19.7  5.0 \nLocal government equity, Jilin  78.4  19.7 \nTariffs  3.5  0.9 \nPrivate sector equity (Tsinghua Tongfang)  3.4  0.9 \nDomestic banks  0.3  0.1 \n   Total  396.3  100.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB will provide a loan of $200 million to finance 50.5% of the project cost, \nincluding  financing  charges  during  construction.  The  Government  will \nfinance  49.5%  through  a  combination  of  water  and  wastewater  tariffs, \ndomestic bank loans, state bonds, and capital infusions from the county \nand city governments.  \n   \nLoan Amount and  ADB\u2019s loan of $200 million will come from its ordinary capital resources and \nTerms  will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility for US dollar loans. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.  \n   \nAllocation and  From  the  total  loan  proceeds,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  will  make \nRelending Terms  $100 million available to HPG and $100 million to JPG. HPG and JPG will \nmake  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  concerned  county  and  city \ngovernments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan; \nthe loan proceeds will then be onlent to the implementing agencies (IAs) on \nthe  same  terms  and  conditions.  The  IAs  will  bear  the  risks  of  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation for their portion of the loan proceeds, \nand  undertake  to  perform  the  obligations  as  provided  in  the  Project \nAgreement applicable to the IAs.   \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2014  \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  HPG is the Executing Agency (EA) for the Heilongjiang component. JPG is \nArrangements  the EA for the Jilin component. HPG and JPG have established project \nleading groups (PLGs), each chaired by a vice governor. These will provide \noverall policy guidance, facilitate inter-agency coordination, and resolve any \ninstitutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  The  Heilongjiang \nPLG consists of members from the Heilongjiang Provincial Development \nand  Reform  Commission,  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Finance  Bureau,  the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Audit Bureau, and the Heilongjiang Environmental \nProtection  Department. The  Jilin  PLG  consists  of  members  of  the  Jilin \n   ", "v \nProvincial Development and Reform Commission, Jilin Provincial Finance \nBureau, and Jilin Provincial Environmental Protection Department. As they \nare  members  of  the  leading  group  for  the  SRBPCMP,  the  two  vice \ngovernors will be able to ensure effective coordination between the two \nprovinces in implementing the proposed Project. HPG and JPG have also \nestablished project management offices (PMOs), each with a director and \nstaff. The project county and city governments in Heilongjiang and Jilin \nhave established similar organization structures including PMOs chaired by \nvice mayors. The county and city PMOs will maintain interdepartmental \ncoordination and work closely with Heilongjiang and Jilin PMOs. \n \nExecuting  Heilongjiang provincial government, Jilin provincial government  \nAgencies \n   \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts for \nworks estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for \nworks estimated to be equal to or less than the above ICB values, but more \nthan $100,000, will be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding \nprocedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), \nsubject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works \nestimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures. \n   \nConsulting  For  Heilongjiang,  about  25  person-months  of  international  consultant \nServices  expertise and 83 person-months of national consultant expertise will be \nrequired.  For  Jilin,  about  20  person-months  of  international  consultant \nexpertise and 71 person-months of national consultant expertise will be \nrequired. Consulting services are required for (i) providing design review \nand advisory services to ensure that the technical specifications, detailed \ndesign  drawings,  and  implementation  schedules  properly  address  all \ntechnical issues, complying with engineering norms, and are up to date; \n(ii)  supporting  project  management;  (iii)  establishing  the  project \nperformance management system; (iv) preparing a strategy for reduction of \nnonrevenue water along with a time-bound action plan for water supply; \n(v)  conducting  social,  environmental,  and  resettlement  monitoring; \n(vi)  supporting  financial  management;  (vii)  helping  with  private  sector \nparticipation  initiatives;  (viii)  providing  training  on  project  management, \nprocurement, and construction supervision as well as on how to operate the \nwastewater collection and treatment facilities, SWM facilities, and the water \nsupply treatment and distribution systems; and (ix) improving operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Two consulting firms (one for each province) will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \n  ", " vi \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will benefit about 9.94 million urban residents in the project \nand Beneficiaries  counties and cities in Heilongjiang province and Jilin province, whose living \nconditions and public health standards will be improved by (i) better water \nsupply, wastewater services, solid waste management, and less nonpoint \nsource pollution through increased SWM capacity; (ii) a lower incidence of \nwaterborne diseases to below 2007 levels (to be monitored through the \nproject performance management system); and (iii) saved water through \nwater reuse and a reduction in unaccounted-for water. \n \nThe  Project  will  result  in  better  management  and  utilization  of  water \nresources, and a reduction in pollution in the SRB, bringing positive and \ntransjurisdictional benefits to the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. The \nwater quality improvements in the SRB will also contribute to integrated \nwater  resource  management  and  pollution  control,  a  basin-wide \nmanagement program; and transboundary pollution prevention and control. \nThe Project will secure the provision of clean and reliable water supply to \nthe project counties and cities in Heilongjiang province by developing new \ndrinking  water  sources.  The  proposed  extension,  replacement,  and \nrehabilitation of water distribution systems will increase the proportion of the \npopulation with access to piped water supplies. These improvements in the \ndistribution  system  will  reduce  water  losses  and  reduce  the  risk  of \ncontamination of treated water within the distribution system. Recycling \nwastewater will reduce water pollution and address the water shortage.  \n \nOf the total beneficiary population, about 325,000 persons in Heilongjiang \n(4.62%),  and  355,000  persons  in  Jilin  (12.24%)  are  classified  as  poor \nmeasured by the weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY2,196 \nper person per year. Major social measures to protect urban residents from \nfalling into poverty include (i) a living allowance for laid-off employees, \n(ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support program under the \nminimum-living-standard scheme. Further, the county and city governments \nhave  agreed  to  implement  poverty  reduction  measures,  including  (i) \nproviding lifeline tariffs, (ii) offering water bill discounts or cash rebates \namounting to 20\u201330% of monthly water bills for households living below the \npoverty line, and (iii) connecting the poorest households to tap water. The \nProject will create a minimum of 1,380 person-years of direct long\u2013term \nemployment during operation of the facilities, and 6,620 person-years of \ndirect short-term employment during the 5-year construction period. About \nhalf of the construction jobs are unskilled and will be probably be filled by \ncurrently unemployed persons. Public health benefits will accrue through \n(i) a reduction in waterborne and airborne diseases, (ii) savings on medical \ntreatment costs, and (iii) improved workforce productivity. The Project is \ntechnically  sound,  affordable  to  beneficiaries,  and  financially  and \neconomically viable. \n   \nRisks and  The following risks could affect the timely implementation and economic \nAssumptions  viability  of  the  Project,  and  reduce  its  benefits:  (i)  amendments  and \nchanges to the project county and city master plans; (ii) lack of proper \noperation and maintenance of project facilities; (iii) ineffective organizational \nstructures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in \n   ", "vii \ninefficient project development and delayed implementation; (iv) delays in \nthe provision of counterpart funding; (v) failure of the project county and city \ngovernments to increase water, wastewater, and solid waste tariffs to meet \ncost recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement \nissues, which could constrain the efficient implementation of the project \nworks and the restoration of livelihoods of the affected persons. The Project \ndoes not have any unusual technical risks.  \n \nThe project components will use technology that conforms to international \nstandards.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control \nand Management Project. \n \n2.  In line with its long-term goals to improve the urban environment and control pollution in \nthe Songhua River Basin (SRB), the Government requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to help increase the water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management \n(SWM) capacity in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces in the northeast of the PRC. The Project is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s water policy1 and will help the PRC achieve Millennium Development \nGoal 7, target 10 which calls for a halving of the proportion of people without access to safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. This report is based on the findings of the Loan \nFact-Finding  Mission  and  discussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments,  relevant \nagencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, continuous economic growth has \nbeen accompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population has grown from 160 million in \n1975 to about 577.1 million in 2006. The urbanization rate increased from 17% to 43.9% in the \nsame  period,  and  is  expected  to  reach  55%  (or  about  700  million)  in  2030.  This  rapid \nurbanization over three decades of economic reform was largely fueled by the transformation of \nsuburban areas from farming to nonfarming activities, and by the massive migration of surplus \nrural labor to urban areas. The number of cities in the PRC increased from 193 in 1978 to 661 in \n2006. There are also 19,522 towns. Of the total urban population of 577.1 million in 2006, an \nestimated  115.5  million  (20%)  live  in  small  cities  and  239.1  million  (41%)  in  towns.2  The \nGovernment highlighted sustainable urbanization as a key policy priority in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan (FYP), 2006\u20132010. \n \n4.  Rapid urbanization in the PRC has taken a severe toll on the environment, and has also \nchallenged the capacity of local governments to promote good governance, effective planning \nand management, sustainable financing, and timely delivery of public services. While significant \nprogress has been made in building urban infrastructure over the past two decades, it tends to \nbe  concentrated  on  the  more  highly  developed  eastern  and  southern  coastal  plains.  The \nexpansion and upgrading of public services has not kept pace with rapid industrial growth. The \nmigration  to  urban  centers  currently  taking  place  in  the  inland  regions  (in  response  to \ngovernment policies to promote economic development and job creation in these areas) is \nputting a further strain on urban infrastructure and services.  \n \n5.  Cities in the north and west and around the SRB are experiencing widespread pollution \ncaused by the discharge of untreated wastewater and improper management of solid waste. \nShortages of safe drinking water are also common, particularly in the north of the PRC. The \nGovernment has classified more than 108 cities as having serious water problems, and 60 as \nbeing critically short of water. The situation has been exacerbated by the pollution of raw water \nsources  by  the  discharge  of  inadequately  treated  agricultural,  municipal,  and  industrial \nwastewater.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  Data for towns are adapted from \u201c2006 China Urban Development Report\u201d, and for small cities from China \nEconomic Information Network.  ", "2         \n6.  The enormous volume of wastewater and solid waste generated by PRC\u2019s urban areas \nposes a major environmental threat to the country\u2019s rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. In \n2006, the PRC generated about 54.0 billion cubic meters (m3) of wastewater3\u2014about 55% from \nmunicipal  sources  and  45%  from  industrial  sources.  Currently,  about  90%  of  industrial \nwastewater is treated before discharge to municipal sewers. Municipal wastewater is a major \ncontributor to the pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes. As of 2006, only about 57% of urban \nwastewater was treated (compared with 34% in 2000); the rest was discharged untreated into \nrivers and lakes. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) maintains a network of 3,200 \nwater quality monitoring stations nationwide. According to the 2005 State of the Environment \nReport,4 about 41% of the water in the seven major river basins5 does not meet the class III \nnational water quality standard.6 Of the 50 lakes that are regularly monitored, 13 are partially \npolluted, 19 are seriously polluted, and only 18 meet the class III standard. Surface water \nsources serving municipal water supply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under the \ncurrent water quality standards.  \n \n7.  The amount of solid waste generated by urban areas has also expanded rapidly. In \n2006, the PRC generated 186 million tons of solid waste\u2014an increase of 57% over the 2001 \nvolume of 118 million tons. However, the increase in treatment capacity has not kept pace, and \nthe capacity that has been developed is mainly for large cities. Few small cities and towns have \nwastewater and solid waste facilities. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public health, the \ngrowing and uncontrolled disposal of solid waste contributes to increasing contamination of \ngroundwater supplies through inadequate leachate collection systems.  \n \n8.  In the 11th FYP, the Government prioritized environmental issues, including water and \nair  pollution,  through  policy  reform,  more  investment,  and  better  urban  infrastructure \nmanagement. Recognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are \nessential for sustainable economic growth, the Government has incorporated environmental \nprotection  as  a  national  priority  in  its  development  strategy.  In  addition  to  enacting \nenvironmental  protection  laws  and  implementing  regulations  that  emphasize  preventive \nmeasures,  the  polluter  pays  principle,  and  decentralized  environmental  management,  the \nGovernment  has  also  undertaken  numerous  programs,  including  those  for  wastewater \nmanagement.7 Industries were ordered to treat wastewater to meet the national wastewater \ndischarge  standards  by  the  end  of  2000;  municipalities  have  5-year  plans  to  address \nwastewater collection, treatment, and disposal; and pollution control plans have been developed \nand partially implemented for the key river basins. The Government has decreed8 that, by 2010, \nthe wastewater treatment rate in all cities of the PRC should not be lower than 60%, and that it \nshould not be lower than 70% for the major cities9 with secondary treatment facilities. The \ntreatment level required is dependent on the water environmental functions or quality class of \nthe receiving water body. To achieve water quality class I, II, or III, secondary wastewater \ntreatment would normally be required.  \n                                                 \n3  State Environmental Protection Administration. 2006.

Class I is pristine, \nwhile class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water \nsupply. \n7  The PRC Water Prevention and Control Law was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law was enacted \nto prevent and control water pollution, protect and to improve the environment, safeguard human health, and \nensure effective utilization of water resources. The law also establishes standards for water environment quality \nand  for  discharge  of  water  pollutants  and  enumerates  the  planning,  supervision,  and  management  of  the \nprevention and control of water pollution. \n8  Ministry of Construction. 2000. Urban Wastewater Treatment and Control Technology Advice. PRC. \n9  These include cities directly under the central Government, provincial capital cities and key tourist cities. \n   ", "3 \n \n9.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on:  (i)  developing  water  sources;  (ii)  protecting \nexisting sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; (iii) introducing water-efficient \ntechnologies  and  operations;  and  (iv)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to  encourage \nconservation and generate necessary funds for operation, maintenance, and investment. The \nGovernment\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that all water supply \nand wastewater projects be financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. An urban \nsector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n10.  Key problems and opportunities include (i) a shortage of good quality drinking water,  \n(ii) inadequate wastewater treatment capacity, (iii) inadequate SWM facilities and services, and \n(iv) making water supply and wastewater treatment self-financing through tariff reforms. The \nproposed Project covers five counties and six cities in Heilongjiang Province;10 and seven \ncounties, seven cities and one special administrative district in Jilin Province.11 A brief profile of \neach county and city is given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n11.  Songhua River Basin (SRB). The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after \nthe Yangtze  and Yellow  rivers.  It  has  an  area  of  557,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  a \npopulation of 62 million. The SRB contains major cities, including Changchun and Harbin, and \nthe PRC\u2019s largest oil fields. Agriculture is well developed and there is a large industrial base. \nThe Songhua River catchment covers portions of three provinces and one autonomous region\u2013\nHeilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR). \nAbout 48.4% of the catchment is located in Heilongjiang province (covering 59.4% of the \nprovincial territory), 24.1% in Jilin province (71.6% of the provincial territory), 27.4% in IMAR \n(12.9% of the autonomous region\u2019s territory) and 0.1% in Liaoning province (0.36% of the \nprovincial territory). The Songhua River has two headwaters; in the west, the Nenjiang River \noriginates from Yilehuli Mountain of the Greater Hinggan mountain range; and in the south, the \nSecond  Songhua  River  originates  from  the  Heavenly  Lake  on  top  of  the  Changbaishan \nMountain. The two rivers converge at Sanchakou (border of Heilongjiang and Jiin provinces) to \nform the Songhua river which joins the Heilongjiang River, enters the Russian Federation, and \neventually discharges to the sea.  \n \n12.  The SRB is seriously polluted and is acknowledged by the MEP to be one of the four \nmost polluted river basins in the PRC. Water pollution in the SRB, especially in relation to the \nprotection of drinking water resources for the municipality of Harbin, has received increased \nnational and international attention following a widely publicized pollution incident in the SRB in \nNovember and December 2005. The Songhua River is contaminated with a number of known \nand suspected trace organic chemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants. It is classified by \nthe Government as class IV in some sections of the Songhua River (and even falls below class \nV  during  the  6-month  low-flow  winter  season),  and  is  considered  unsuitable  for  municipal \ndomestic water use. In March 2003, ADB approved the Harbin Water Supply Project ($100 \nmillion)12 to address the needs of Harbin City, with a population of 3 million, for clean and \nreliable drinking water from an alternative water source (Lalin River), since the existing source \n                                                 \n10    The five counties are: Fangzheng, Nenjiang, Tangyuan, Tonghe, and Yanshou. The six cities are Fujin, Harbin, \nJiamusi, Qitaihe, Qiqihar, and Shuangyashan. \n11    The seven counties are: Fusong, Fuyu, Huinan, Jingyu, Liuhe, Tonghua and Tongyu. The seven cities are Da\u2019an, \nDehui, Gongzhuling, Huadian, Jiaohe, Meihekou, and Yushu. The special administrative district is the Changbai \nMountain Administrative District.  \n12    ADB. 2003.

The project districts are receiving the \nnew high quality of water. \n  ", "4         \nfrom the Songhua River was highly polluted. Because of the deteriorating water quality in the \nSonghua River, the Harbin Municipal Government expedited construction of the Harbin Water \nSupply Project, which was completed 1 year ahead of the original schedule. \n \n13.  The Government is focusing more attention on improving the SRB water quality during \nthe current and the next two FYPs. The PRC top leadership has expressed strong support for \npollution reduction and water quality improvement in the SRB, and the overall target is to ensure \nwater  quality  in  the  SRB  meets  the  PRC  class  III  water  quality  standards  by  2020.  The \nupgrading  of  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  (SEPA),  which  led  the \npreparation of the SRB Water Pollution Prevention and Control Master Plan (SRBPCMP), into \nthe MEP will further strengthen that effort. With support from the National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC), the MEP will take the lead while each of the provinces will \nimplement their respective shares of the SRBPCMP.   \n \n14.  Project Rationale. During the processing of the Harbin Water Supply Project, ADB held \nextensive  discussions  with  the  Government  on  addressing  pollution  control  in  the  SRB. \nConsequently, in 2002 ADB provided technical assistance (TA) for water quality and pollution \ncontrol management in the Songhua River Basin.13  \n \n15.  The TA, which was highly successful,14 had the following impacts. First, it developed a \nlong-term vision for the SRB, consisting of a strategic plan identifying water quality objectives, \ntargets  and  reforms  and  strengthening  of  the  existing  river  basin  and  pollution  control \nmanagement practices, and proposed a long-term physical investment program. Second, it \nstrengthened  the  capacity  of  key  organizations  responsible  for  pollution  control  and \nmanagement at both the river basin and regional level, and prepared a road map outlining the \nkey milestones leading to the development of a river basin management framework within the \nPRC. Third, it identified knowledge gaps relating particularly to nonpoint sources of pollution, \nwater quality assessment (notably micropollutants), and water quality inventories. Fourth, it \ndeveloped an overall strategic plan for the SRB, both refining and prioritizing existing strategic \nplans developed by different institutions at different levels (river basin and provincial level). The \nstrategic plan includes the identification of an investment plan to be implemented over 15 years. \nFifth, it (i) assisted the Government to develop a long-term water pollution control plan for the \nSRB beyond 2010, and (ii) provided strategic policy inputs to the 11th FYP and the SRBPCMP. \nThe SRBPCMP (2006\u20132010), approved by the State Council on 29 March 2006, is an action \nprogram to set pollution control targets from 2006 to 2010, requiring that urban environmental \npollution  and  ecological  damage  be  controlled  by  2010.  Untreated  wastewater  is  a  major \nproblem in the SRB and the SRBPCMP specifies that the wastewater treatment rate in large \nand medium-sized cities should not be less than 70% by 2010. The significant increase in the \nwastewater treatment capacity under the proposed Project would contribute to the target of \nimproving the water quality in the SRB, from the current class IV and V to class III by 2020.  \n \n16.  The Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development (JWSSD) Project ($100 million),15 \napproved in 2005, was the first major ADB investment directly addressing pollution control in \nSRB. The Jilin Urban Environmental Improvement (JUEI) Project ($100 million),16 approved in \n2007 was the second, and it follows the priority list of SRBPCMP. The proposed Project, with an \nindicative ADB loan of $200 million, will be the third major ADB investment in the SRB, and \n                                                 \n13   ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and \nPollution Control Management. Manila. \n14   ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance Completion Report Songhua River Basin Water Quality and Pollution Control \nManagement. Manila. \n15   As of 3 September 2008, cumulative contract awards and disbursements amount to $68.71 million and $34.14 \nmillion, respectively. \n16     The loan was signed on 26 February 2008 and was effective on 20 June 2008. \n   ", "5 \nfollows the priority list of SRBPCMP. This comprehensive strategic approach to addressing \npollution control in the SRB will serve as a model for demonstration and replication elsewhere in \nthe PRC. The proposed Project will help the concerned counties and cities in Heilongjiang \nprovince to achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2012. It will also help the project \ncounties and cities in Jilin to achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 90% by 2012. Key areas for \nreplication include, (i) the approach to studying the complex issues of SRB water quality and \npollution  control  management;  (ii)  the  river  basin  approach  to  managing  water  quality;  \n(iii) the strategic pollution control action plan, which combines technical assessment, identifying \ninvestments on a prioritized basis, and institutional planning; and (iv) prioritized investments and \nrelated capacity building. \n \n17.  The  underdeveloped  wastewater  collection  and  wastewater  treatment  in  the  project \ncounties  and  cities  leads  to  the  discharge  of  untreated  wastewater  into  local  rivers,  and \neventually to the pollution of the SRB. Water quality in some sections of the Songhua River and \nits tributaries does not meet class V of the PRC surface water quality standard. The lack of \nadequate wastewater management degrades local rivers, poses a threat to public health, and \nadversely affects the quality of life in the project counties and cities. There is an urgent need to \nexpand the sewer network and wastewater treatment capacity in project counties and cities. \nHeilongjiang has identified 13 subprojects, focusing on water supply and wastewater treatment. \nJilin has identified 20 subprojects, focusing on wastewater treatment, solid waste management, \nand river improvement. Sector and project lending were thoroughly discussed and considered \nas alternative approaches.17 The Government expressed a strong preference for the project \nlending approach because all subprojects have been identified and the feasibility study reports \nhave  been  completed,  and  there  was  an  urgent  need  to  implement  the  subprojects  in \naccordance with the SRBPCMP. All subprojects have one common impact, which is to improve \nthe urban environment and enhance the quality of life in project counties and cities, and they will \nall contribute significantly to pollution control in the SRB.  \n \n18.  The project counties and cities in Heilongjiang Province18 rely primarily on surface water \nfor  their  water  supply.  Under  normal  conditions,  water  demand  is  expected  to  exhaust \ndeveloped  capacity  in  the  project  counties  and  cities  by  2010.  These  counties  and  cities \nexperienced  supply  problems  during  a  severe  episode  of  drought  in  2004  leading  to \ndangerously low water levels in the reservoirs and loss of effective treatment plant capacity. \nThey also experienced low pressure and supply interruptions.  \n \n19.  The project counties and cities in Jilin province have domestic SWM featuring domestic \nwaste pick-up, extensive informal recovery of recyclables, and disposal in a managed landfill. \nGiven that their existing landfill sites will be fully utilized within 2 years, timely construction of \nnew domestic solid waste treatment facilities is urgently needed. The inadequate solid waste \nmanagement capacity causes nonpoint source pollution which contaminates the ground drinking \nwater supplies.   \n \n20.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC to make markets \nwork  more  efficiently  through  infrastructure  development  and  to  promote  environmental \nsustainability.  \n \n21.  Policy  Dialogue. The  Project  builds  on  and  furthers ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment in several key areas including: (i) cost recovery and tariff reform, (ii) wastewater \nmanagement,  (iii)  upstream  and  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (iv)  water \nconservation,  (v)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise  reform,  and  (vi)  private  sector \n                                                 \n17 During a mission to Beijing in January 2007, detailed discussions were undertaken with the Government on the \nMFF, sector, and project lending modalities for the proposed Project. \n18  It includes Fujin City, Tangyuan County, Tonghe County, and Yanshou County. \n  ", "6         \nparticipation. The cost recovery regulations are stipulated in the national guidelines on water \nsupply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management. ADB has supported the water tariff \nreform process through two water tariff TA projects19 with the Ministry of Construction under \nwhich  the  market-oriented  National  Guidelines  on  Water  Tariffs  (NGWT)  were  developed, \npromulgated,  and  implemented.  The  water  tariff  TA  projects  (i)  strengthened  the  financial \nsustainability of municipal water supply companies; (ii) piloted implementation of the national \nguidelines  in  the  selected  case  study  cities  of  Chengdu,  Fuzhou,  and  Zhangjiakou;  and  \n(iii) recommended financial regulations for water supply companies and designed nationwide \ntraining programs. The NGWT requires water supply companies to adopt full cost recovery as \ntheir main objective when they set water tariffs. The full cost recovery formula for water tariffs \nalso includes a return on equity to attract private investors. The NGWT is being implemented \nnationwide. In 2002, ADB provided a TA project on Preparing the National Guidelines for Urban \nWastewater Tariffs and Management Study.20 The TA was completed in 2003 and assisted the \nGovernment to refine the wastewater tariff principles, develop national guidelines for wastewater \ntariffs, and improve urban wastewater management. In 2000, ADB approved a TA project on \nstrengthening urban SWM.21 Completed in 2003, the TA assisted the Government to develop a \nnational policy framework and plans for urban SWM, refine the National Guidelines on Solid \nWaste Tariffs, and conduct related capacity building. It established a strong foundation for the \nformulation of the national urban wastewater tariff guidelines for large and medium cities in the \nPRC.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  Government  to  develop  national  policy  frameworks  for \nwastewater and solid waste tariffs, including tariff calculation methodologies focusing on small \ncities and towns.22 All the project county and city governments have firm plans to increase water \ntariffs  on  an  average  basis  from  CNY2.50/m3  to  CNY2.80/m3  and  wastewater  tariffs  from  \nCNY 0.50/m3 to CNY0.80/m3 by 2009. This indicates the support for tariff reform in the project \ncounties and cities.23 The policy dialogue is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n22.  Increases in the tariff for water supply and wastewater treatment under the Project are \nimportant  for  full  cost  recovery,  which  is  needed  to  attract  private  sector  participation. An \nassurance requires the project counties and cities to ensure that water and wastewater tariffs be \nset at a level that ensures full cost recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M), depreciation, \nand financial costs, including debt service obligations and a reasonable profit margin for water \nand  wastewater  treatment  during  the  project  operational  phase.  This  will  also  ensure  the \nfinancial sustainability of the Project.  \n \n23.  ADB has also provided TA support to the Government on the use of market-based \ninstruments to enhance private sector partnership in public utilities, mainly for water supply, \nwastewater,  and  SWM.24  This  TA  analysed  the  issues  in  the  context  of  international  best \npractices and how these could be adopted in the PRC. The PRC resident mission and the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD) conducted a seminar in Beijing on 25 July 2007 \non  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  lending  for  the  provinces  of  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin.  ADB  is  also \nconducting a study on nonsovereign lending in urban infrastructure development in the PRC.25 \nThe  proposed  Project  will  create  the  environment  necessary  for  eventual  private  sector \nparticipation  by  pursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost  recovery,  enterprise  reform,  and  improved \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1997.

Other types of private sector \nparticipation, including leasing contracts and joint ventures, were also reviewed. Tariff reforms \nand increases would make the IAs financially sustainable, and enable them to generate funds \nfor future water and wastewater expansion projects. Consequently, tariff reforms and capacity \nbuilding under the Project would contribute to improved governance. \n \n24.  External Assistance. Since 1992, ADB has provided 26 loans totalling $2,904 million to \nthe PRC for urban development and environment projects (Appendix 3). ADB has also provided \nabout $52.7 million for more than 75 TA studies to prepare these projects, and to review and \nstudy key issues in water resources, urban water supply, wastewater treatment, and pollution \ncontrol  and  heating.  External  assistance  to  Heilongjiang  province  and  Jilin  province  has \nprincipally been provided by ADB and the World Bank.  \n \n25.  Lessons Learned. ADB\u2019s water supply loan projects in the PRC have generally been \nimplemented  well.26  The  lessons  identified  from  evaluation  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \nprojects highlight the importance of integrating both supply and demand concerns into project \ndesign.  Encouraging  broad  reforms,  such  as  commercial  management,  and  introducing \ncompetition  will  promote  efficient and  responsive  delivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices. Appropriate pricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. Other \nlessons include the need to (i) review technical designs thoroughly; (ii) consider local conditions \nand constraints; (iii) support financial reform, particularly in establishing autonomous wastewater \nentities and tariff increases to ensure sustainability; (iv) strengthen institutions, particularly by \ngiving  them  managerial  autonomy;  (v)  educate  the  public  in  environmental  improvement;  \n(vi) consult the public and involve the community; (vii) address resettlement issues early; and \n(viii)  support  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment.  For \nexample, the PPTA consultants worked closely with the local design institutes to review the \ndemand and supply side analysis for each subproject, through the use of historical and national \nbaseline data and technical design standards. This resulted in adjustments in the selection of \ntechnologies  and  equipment,  optimization  of  the  engineering  designs  which  has  led  to \nreductions in land acquisition and resettlement costs. Full cost recovery through a phased \napproach was assessed in detail and this was discussed and agreed with the EAs and IAs. \nTraining  and  institutional  strengthening  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign  including,  among  others,  public  education  activities  on  environmental  health  and \nsanitation. \n \n26.  A recently completed portfolio performance review of the water supply, sanitation, and \nwaste management sector identified successes and deficiencies. It also acknowledged lessons \nfrom portfolio performance27 and the PRC country assistance program evaluation. Among the \nmajor issues identified were (i) delays in the start-up of projects and in procurement, (ii) weak \ninstitutional arrangements for project implementation and sustainable operations, and (iii) a low \nproportion of civil works financing, resulting in loan savings and cancellation of surplus loan \namounts. During project processing, lessons were taken into consideration by (i) thoroughly \nevaluating the technical designs and technologies; (ii) ensuring an adequate debt\u2013equity ratio \nfor the project IAs; (iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows, and financial and \neconomic analysis; and (iv) incorporating institutional strengthening measures to improve the \nlevel of corporate governance to complement the capacity development components included in \nthe Harbin Water Supply, JWSSD and JUEI projects.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA  Impact and Outcome  \n \n27.  The Project will enhance the urban environment and improve public health and the \nquality  of  life  for  urban  residents  in  the  project  cities  and  counties  in  the  provinces  of \nHeilongjiang and Jilin. This will be achieved by increasing wastewater treatment coverage, \nenhancing SWM, and improving the supply of potable water. The outcome of the Project will be \nreduced pollution and improved water supply, wastewater management, and SWM in the SRB.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n28.  The components include better water supply and wastewater services in Heilongjiang \nprovince; improved wastewater facilities, SWM, and river improvement in Jilin province; and \ninstitutional capacity building for efficient project implementation and management for both \nprovinces. The Project has three components, broken down into five subcomponents (outputs) \nand 20 activities as indicated in the design and monitoring framework. These will contribute to \nand support the 11th FYPs of the provincial governments in Heilongjiang and Jilin and the SRB \nWater  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Master  Plan  (SRBPCMP)  by  (i)  reducing  pollutant \nloading to the SRB through direct collection and treatment of wastewater (point sources) and \nmunicipal solid wastes (nonpoint sources) in the project counties and cities; (ii) addressing the \nwater shortage problem through effluent reuse; (iii) providing a supply of reliable and high-\nquality potable water in four counties and cities of Heilongjiang province; (iv) reducing both point \nand nonpoint sources of pollution in the Changbaishan Administrative District; (v) reducing the \nincidence of waterborne diseases; (vi) increasing the efficiency and management capacity of the \nIAs;  (vii)  integrating  approaches  for  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control;  and  \n(viii) improving cost recovery through a better tariff structure, with gradual increases to achieve \nfull cost recovery. A detailed description of project components is in Appendix 4.  \n \n29.  Component I. The Heilongjiang component has two subcomponents: (i) water supply \nand (ii) wastewater treatment. The first subcomponent includes the construction of four water \ntreatment plants (WTPs) with a cumulative capacity of 49,500 m3/day and 120 kilometers (km) \nof  water  transmission  pipelines.  The  second  includes  the  construction  of  nine  wastewater \ntreatment plants (WWTPs) with a total treatment capacity of 381,000 m3/day and 199 km of \nsewer pipelines.   \n \n30.  Component II. The Jilin component has three subcomponents: (i) wastewater treatment, \n(ii) SWM, and (iii) river improvement. The first subcomponent includes the construction of nine \nWWTPs with a total capacity of 178,000 m3/day and 368 km of sewer pipelines. The second \nsubcomponent includes the construction of 10 sanitary landfill facilities with a total capacity of \n2,400 tons per day with service life ranging from 13 to 22 years. The third subcomponent \nincludes river improvement at the source of the Songhua River including (i) two WWTPs with \ntotal capacity of 3,100 m3/day, (ii) three solid waste transfer stations with a total capacity of 40 \ntons per day, and (iii) 3.8 km of sewer pipelines.  \n \n31.  Component  III. This  Component  provides  for  institutional  capacity  development  for \neffective  project  management  including  (i)  providing  training  to  strengthen  organizational \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n   ", "9 \nstructures and staff resources to implement, operate, and maintain the project components;  \n(ii) strengthening management practices in human resources, finance, and corporate planning; \nand  (iii)  providing  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  public  awareness  program  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of project benefits.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n32.  Integrated River Basin Management. The proposed Project is an integral part of the \nbasin-wide  Songhua  water  resources  management  initiative,  and  the  SRBPCMP.  It  will \ncomplement the ongoing JWSSD Project and the JUIE Project to address pollution control in the \nSRB. The water quality improvements will contribute to integrated water resource management \nand  pollution  control,  a  basin-wide  management  program,  and  transboundary  pollution \nprevention and control. The proposed Project reflects a continuation of ADB\u2019s effort to improve \nthe  environment  of  the  SRB  following  the  JWSSD  Project  and  the  JUEI  Project.  Lessons \nlearned from the JWSDD Project and the JUEI Project regarding the integration of wastewater \ntreatment, water reuse, and water resource protection are continued and improved under the \nproposed  Project.  The  Project  focuses  on  strengthening  the  environmental  management \ninstitutions and the policy dialogue on integrated river basin management and pollution control \nin the SRB, resulting in improved environmental performance.  \n \n33.  Public\u2013Private Participation. The proposed Project is catalyzing additional public and \nprivate sector investments in reducing pollution in the SRB. The ADB East Asia Department \n(EARD) and PSOD are adopting a public\u2013private partnership approach to address the large \nwastewater treatment funding needs for Heilongjiang province. PSOD is preparing a project29 \nfor the Tsinghua Tongfang Water Engineering Company Limited (TTWE), a private firm, which is \ncurrently managing the largest WTP in Harbin. The PSOD project will provide an equity injection \nand credit lines30 to the TTWE to undertake the management of WTPs and WWTPs in other \ncities  in  Heilongjiang.  TTWE  is  the  borrower  and  the  sponsor  is  the  Tsinghua  Tongfang \nCompany Limited, a publicly listed company, which is an integrated solution provider in the \ntechnology and environmental protection sector. TTWE is focusing on the water and wastewater \nsector  business  and  is  exploring  private\u2013public  participation  opportunities  with  local \ngovernments. TTWE, with an equity investment of $3.4 million, is a minority shareholder in the \nQitaihe City Central WWTP and an effluent reuse subproject included in the proposed Project. \nFor this subproject, the ADB loan will be used along with the local government counterpart funds \nand private funds. The TTWE investment would (i) solve the funding shortage problem at \nQitaihe, and (ii) improve the management and operational efficiency at Qitaihe through training \nprovided by TTWE. This pilot demonstration subproject could be replicated in other subprojects \nin Heilongjiang, and then in Jilin province. TTWE has firm plans to invest in six other cities in \nHeilongjiang province. Further, two other foreign companies are actively involved in joint venture \ninvestments in wastewater treatment in Heilongjiang province.  \n \n34.  Tariff Reform. Some of the project counties and cities have committed to generate \nfunds  to  finance  the  water  and  wastewater  subcomponent  of  the  Project  from  water  and \nwastewater tariff increases amounting to $3.5 million. 31 \n \n                                                 \n29  Proposed Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project Private Sector Facility. \nManagement approved the concept paper on 17 October 2008. \n30    At the concept clearance stage, this tentatively includes (i) equity investment, the lower of $12 million and 20% of \nthe equity capital in TTWE; (ii) direct loans up to $35 million, in USD or CNY subject to ADB\u2019s funding availability, \nwith a tenure of up to 12 years; and (iii) B-loan up to $100 million through the complementary financing scheme \nof ADB in USD. Exact amounts and detailed terms of the equity investment, direct loans, and B-loans will be \nfirmed up during the due diligence and negotiations. \n31   The cities include Jiamusi in Heilongjiang ($1.24 million), Dehui ($0.75 million), Fuyu ($0.93 million), and Liuhe \n($0.54 million) in Jilin Province.   \n  ", "10        \n35.  Catalytic Impact. The policy dialogue on pollution control in the SRB that started with \nthe  preparation  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project  and  the  cumulative  efforts  up  to  the \nproposed Project have had a large catalytic impact on mobilizing resources to reduce pollution \nin  the  SRB.  The  proposed  Project  is  catalyzing  both  additional  government  and  private \ninvestments to reduce pollution in the SRB.    \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n36.  The project investment is estimated at $396.3 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties.

Financing Plan \n \n37.  The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project, out of which $100 million is for Heilongjiang province and \n$100 million is for Jilin province. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility for US dollar loans, commitment charge, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n   ", "11 \n \n38.  The ADB loan will finance 50.5% of the project cost, including the base cost and the \nfinancial charges during implementation and taxes and duties. Local costs will be financed from \nwater and wastewater tariffs, domestic loans from PRC banks,32 capital infusion from the local \ngovernment, and state bonds. HPG and JPG have confirmed the allocation of state bond \nfunds33 to the project counties and cities. The local governments have provided commitment \nletters confirming their respective counterpart fund contributions to the Project.

The Borrower is the PRC. The Government of the PRC will make the loan proceeds \navailable to the HPG and JPG on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \nHPG  and  JPG  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  concerned  county  and  city \ngovernments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan; the loan proceeds will \nthen be onlent to the IAs on the same terms and conditions. The IAs will bear the risks of foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation for their portion of the loan proceeds, and undertake to \nperform the obligations as provided in the Project Agreement applicable to the IAs. The flow of \nfunds and the onlending arrangements are shown in Appendix 6. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n40.  HPG is the Executing Agency (EA) for the Heilongjiang component. JPG is the EA for \nthe Jilin component. HPG and JPG have established project leading groups (PLGs), each \nchaired by a vice governor. The PLG will provide overall policy guidance, facilitate interagency \ncoordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  The \nHeilongjiang  PLG  consists  of  members  from  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Development  and \nReform Commission, Heilongjiang Provincial Finance Bureau, the Heilongjiang Provincial Audit \nBureau, and the Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Department. The Jilin PLG consists of \nthe Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission, Jilin Provincial Finance Bureau, and \nJilin Provincial Environmental Protection Department. Effective project coordination between \nHeilongjiang and Jilin would be ensured through (i) the SRBPCMP leading group, which is \nchaired by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), and consists of, among others,34 the \nvice governors of Heilongjiang and Jililn as members; (ii) three coordination meetings between \n                                                 \n32 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Construction Bank. \n33 State bonds issued by the central Government, which allocates these grant funds to the provinces based on \npriority.

As \nthey are members of the leading group for the SRBPCMP, the two vice governors will be able to \nensure effective coordination between the two provinces in implementing the proposed Project. \nHPG and JPG have also established PMOs, each with a director and staff. The project county \nand  city  governments  in  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  have  also  established  similar  organization \nstructures, including PMOs chaired by their vice mayors. The county and city level PMOs will \nmaintain interdepartmental coordination and work closely with Jilin and Heilongjiang PMOs. \n \n41.  All the IAs listed in Appendix 4 are limited liability companies incorporated under PRC \nCompany Law.35 The board of directors of each IA will oversee the financial and operational \nmatters of each IA, including (i) hiring and firing of senior management, (ii) reviewing staffing \nand  remuneration  plans,  (iii)  reviewing  the  progress  of  construction  and  approving  annual \nconstruction plans, (iv) reviewing and approving annual financial budgets, (v) reviewing the \ninvestment  plans  and  accounts  of  the  IAs,  and  (vi)  approving  the  procurement  of  major \nequipment and civil works contracts. The IAs will increase their staff strength significantly for the \nconstruction  period  and  when  operations  begin.  The  internal  controls  and  accounting  and \nauditing procedures of the IAs were reviewed through a financial management assessment \n(FMA) and these are generally in order. The FMA for the Heilongjiang and Jilin IAs is in \nSupplementary Appendix D. The IAs\u2019 technical and institutional capacities have been assessed, \nand these are adequate for project implementation. The IAs will retain the services of design \ninstitutes, specialist procurement agencies, and construction supervision companies to assist in \nthe implementation activities. The PMOs and IAs will have a number of their staff trained in \nproject management and relevant ADB procedures during implementation of the Project. The \ninstitutional and capacity building needs for provincial, county, and city PMOs and IAs have \nbeen assessed and are described in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n   \n42.  Based on discussions with each IA, each subproject implementation schedule has been \nfinalized. The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from 2009 to 2013 although \nsome  of  the  subprojects  are  planned  for  earlier  completion  (Appendix  7).  The  estimated \nimplementation  period  is  based  on  the  project  scope,  central  and  local  government \nrequirements,  and  construction  technology  requirements.  The  attached  implementation \nschedule is considered realistic and achievable based on discussions with each IA because the \nproject implementation structure is already in place, and the preparatory works have already \nstarted. For some subprojects, the preliminary designs are underway.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n   \n43.  All procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).36 Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and \ncontracts for works estimated to cost equal or less than the above ICB values but more than \n$100,000 shall be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed \nwith ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured \nusing shopping procedures. For ICB invitations for bids, invitations for prequalification, draft \nprequalification documents, draft bidding documents, and prequalification and bid evaluation \nreports are to be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. For NCB, the first draft English \n                                                 \n35 PRC Company Law. 1993. \n36 ADB will require the PMO to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents (to be developed as necessary to \nensure high quality and consistency of the documents) that will facilitate ADB review. \n   ", "13 \nlanguage version of the procurement documents should be submitted for ADB review and \napproval  regardless  of  the  estimated  contract  amount.  The  ADB-approved  procurement \ndocuments should then be used as a model for all NCB procurement financed by ADB for the \nProject, and need not be subjected to further review. ADB will review the bid evaluation report \nand award of contract on a post-review basis. For shopping, ADB will review the award of \ncontract on a post-review basis. Procurement plan for subprojects in both provinces are being \nprepared and to be finalized. The summary procurement plans for the subprojects in both \nprovinces  are  presented  in  Appendix  8,  and  the  detailed  procurement  plans  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n4.

HPG and JPG requested (i) advance contracting, which includes tendering and bid \nevaluation  for  civil  works  contract  packages,  preparation  of  tender  documents  and  bid \nevaluation for the procurement of materials, plant, equipment, and vehicles, and recruitment of \nconsultants; and (ii) retroactive financing (Supplementary Appendix G) of eligible expenditures \nup to $10 million (equivalent to 10% of the loan proceeds for Heilongjiang), and $20 million \n(equivalent to 20% of the loan proceeds for Jilin) incurred before loan effectiveness, but not \nearlier than 12 months before signing of the Loan Agreement. The issuance of invitations to bid \nunder advance procurement action will be subject to ADB approval. All advance procurement \nactions  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  or  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) as appropriate. \nContracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. The Government, HPG, JPG, and the IAs have been advised that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n45.  For  the  Heilongjiang  component,  the  Project  provides  funding  for  an  estimated  25 \nperson-months of international and 83 person-months of national consulting services to support \nthe Heilongjiang PMO, local governments, and IAs in project implementation management and \ncapacity building. For the Jilin component, the Project provides funding for an estimated 20 \nperson-months of international and 71 person-months of national consulting services to support \nthe Jilin PMO, local governments, and IAs in project implementation management and capacity \nbuilding. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method (80:20) and requesting full \ntechnical  proposals.  Consulting  services  are  required  for  (i)  providing  design  review  and \nadvisory services to ensure that the technical specifications, detailed design drawings, and \nimplementation  schedules  are  properly  addressing  all  technical  issues,  complying  with \nengineering norms, and are up to date; (ii) project management; (iii) establishing the project \nperformance management system (PPMS); (iv) preparing a strategy for reducing nonrevenue \nwater along with a time-bound action plan for water supply; (v) social, environmental, and \nresettlement monitoring; (vi) financial management; (vii) helping with private sector participation \ninitiatives; (viii) providing training related to project management, procurement, and construction \nsupervision  as  well  as  specific  training  on  such  issues  as  how  to  efficiently  operate  the \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities,  the  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  treatment \nfacilities and the water supply treatment and distribution systems; and (ix) improving O&M. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services is provided in Supplementary Appendix H.   \n \n \n \n \n  ", "14        \n6.  Governance and Anticorruption Policy \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998 and as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  HPG,  JPG,  local  governments  concerned,  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be \nincluded in the loan covenants and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of HPG, JPG, concerned county \nand city governments, and the IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. For the Project, HPG and JPG will undertake the \nfollowing anticorruption actions: (i) involve government officials from the concerned provincial \nand municipal departments in bidding and construction to enhance construction quality control \nand  supervise  effective  work;  (ii)  introduce  a dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works \ncontract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iii) periodically inspect \nthe contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; (iv) engage the project \nmanagement consultant to support PMO and the IAs to ensure good governance, accountability, \nand transparency in project operations; (v) in consultation with relevant central government \nministries, update rules and regulations on local and corporate governance and anticorruption \nand enhance transparency of the IAs\u2019 operations; and (vi) disclose audited financial statements \nand project accounts and contract awards on the project websites of JPG and HPG, the local \ngovernments concerned, and the IAs. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n47.  The loan proceeds for the proposed Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and funds flow, two imprest accounts will be set up upon loan effectiveness at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. One imprest account will be managed by Heilongjiang \nProvincial Finance Bureau, and the other by the Jilin Provincial Finance Bureau. The initial \nadvance to be deposited in the respective imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. For the contracts of \nlarge works under the Project, direct payment procedures will apply. If the Government initially \nfunds eligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedures will be used. \nTo expedite funds flow and simplify documentation process, the statement of expenditures \n(SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  imprest  accounts  and \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. The \npayments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on \nfull supporting documentation.     \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n48.  A loan covenant will require the IAs to submit independently audited annual financial \nstatements and project accounts to ADB. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of \ngoods and services financed out of the loan proceeds, following accounting principles and \npractices  prescribed  by  the  PRC Accounting  Law,37  which  requires  enterprises  to  prepare \nfinancial statements and generally follow internationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs \nwill maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial statements of the project \naccounts and the annual corporate financial statements for IAs will be subject to external audit \n                                                 \n37 Accounting Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China was adopted by the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of \nthe Sixth National People\u2019s Congress on 21 January 1985. \n   ", "15 \nby the concerned local government Audit Bureaus, the Heilongjiang Provincial Audit Bureau, the \nJilin Provincial Audit Bureau, and the State Audit Administration. The audits will be carried out in \naccordance with regulations for auditing approved by the State Council and will meet ADB \nrequirements. The audit reports shall include a separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest accounts and SOE. The IAs\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project \naccounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the \nentire implementation period. The HPG, JPG, concerned local governments, and the IAs have \nbeen informed about the ADB policy requiring the submission of audited financial statements on \ntime. \n \n49.  HPG, JPG, and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of \nthe loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. The Heilongjiang and Jilin \nPMOs will prepare and submit semiannual progress reports indicating (i) progress in project \nactivities, (ii) problems encountered and action taken during the period under review, (iii) the \nproposed program of activities, and (iv) progress expected in the next half year. A project \ncompletion report shall be prepared and submitted to ADB not later than 3 months after the \ncompletion of the project facilities. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n50.  The initial PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were discussed \nwith  the  PMOs  and  IAs  during  project  preparation,  including  (i)  SRB  pollution  reduction;38  \n(ii)  service  levels;  (iii)  nonrevenue  water,  water  conservation,  and  treated  water  quality;  \n(iv) treated wastewater quality and other operational performance measures; (v) percentage of \nwastewater  collected  and  treated;  (vi)  solid  waste  collection,  transportation  and  treatment \nefficiency; (vii) public satisfaction with the urban environment; (viii) economic data to monitor \nproject  impacts  on  improved  living  conditions  and  economic  opportunities;  (ix)  health  and \ngender data; (x) incidence of water-, vector-, and airborne diseases; and (xi) increase in public \nawareness of environmental protection.  \n \n51.  At the beginning of the Project, the Heilongjiang and Jilin PMOs and the IAs, with the \nassistance  of  consultants,39  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  generate \nsystematic data on the inputs and outputs of the subprojects, as well as the indicators noted \nabove to measure project impact. The PMOs and IAs will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) \nconfirm  achievable  goals,  (iii)  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  \n(iv) establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. Under the \nPPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at regular time intervals by the \nPMOs and the IAs, including semiannual reporting of the environmental management plan. The \nPMOs  and  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through  their \nmanagement information system, established at the time of loan implementation. The PPMS will \nbe designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PMOs and IAs, with the assistance of the \nconsultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB twice a year on the physical \nimplementation and financial aspects of the Project from commencement until 2 years after \nproject  completion,  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n38 The loan consultants will further review and indicate 3\u20134 specific indicators, e. g., chemical oxygen demand and  \nbiological oxygen demand. \n39 The Jilin and Heilongjiang PMOs with the assistance of the consultants will review and incorporate as appropriate \nthe monitoring indicators for environmental protection and pollution control developed by MEP for the SRB. \n  ", "16        \n10.  Project Review \n \n52.  ADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least twice a year. \nIn addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years \nafter  the  start  of  project  implementation. This  will  include  a  detailed  review  of  the  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on \nthe  agenda  for  policy  reform  and  capacity-building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS \nactivities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Impacts and Benefits \n \n53.  The Project will directly benefit about 9.94 million urban residents in the project counties \nand cities in Heilongjiang province and Jilin province, whose living conditions and public health \nstandards will be improved by (i) improved quality of water supply and wastewater services and \nsolid waste management and a reduction in nonpoint source pollution through increased SWM \ncapacity; (ii) reduced incidence of waterborne diseases to below 2007 levels (to be monitored \nthrough the PPMS); and (iii) saved water through water reuse and a reduction in unaccounted \nfor water. \n \n54.  The Project will result in improved management and utilization of water resources, and a \nreduction  in  pollution  in  the  SRB,  bringing  positive  and  transjurisdictional  benefits  in  the \nprovinces  of  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin.  The  water  quality  improvements  in  the  SRB  will  also \ncontribute  to  integrated  water  resource  management  and  pollution  control,  a  basin-wide \nmanagement program, and transboundary pollution prevention and control. The Project will \nsecure the provision of a clean and reliable water supply to the project counties and cities in \nHeilongjiang Province by developing new drinking water sources. The proposed extension, \nreplacement, and rehabilitation of water distribution systems will increase the proportion of the \npopulation with access to piped water supplies. These improvements in the distribution system \nwill  reduce  water  losses  and  reduce  the  risk  of  contamination  of  treated  water  within  the \ndistribution  system.  Recycling  wastewater  will  reduce  water  pollution  and  address  water \nshortages.  \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n55.  Resettlement impacts have been identified and resettlement plans have been prepared \nin accordance with PRC laws and regulations governing land acquisition and resettlement and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  is \ndesigned to ensure that affected persons will be better off (or at least not worse off) as a result \nof the Project. Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impact of the Project will be \nsignificant. A total of three full resettlement plans and 18 short resettlement plans with three due \ndiligence reports, and six statements of land acquisition and resettlement40 have been prepared \nby the IAs with the assistance of the local design institute. The 33 subprojects in Heilongjiang \nand  Jilin  province  will  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of  272.6  hectares  (ha)  of  land, \ntemporary acquisition of 125.5 ha, and dismantling of 11,180.64 m2 of residential and non-\nresidential structures. In total, 287 households with 1,523 persons will be permanently affected \nby land acquisition, 331 households with 1,067 persons by temporary land occupation, and 68 \nhouseholds with 238 persons by residential and nonresidential house demolition.  \n \n                                                 \n40 Statements here refer to the subcomponents that involve state-owned land to be acquired. This does not affect \nvillage committee and farmer households.   \n   ", "17 \n56.  The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to be CNY238.1 million \n($34.0  million).41  Of  the  total  resettlement  costs,  CNY46.0  million  ($6.6  million)  is  for \nHeilongjiang province and CNY192.1 million ($27.4 million) is for Jilin province. The measures \nfor economic rehabilitation include: (i) provision of job opportunities to the affected persons \nduring the project construction and operational phases, (ii) provision of basic social insurance to \naffected persons whose land is newly acquired, (iii) development of crops with higher economic \nvalue, (iv) promotion and development of new enterprises and self-employed secondary and \ntertiary businesses, and (v) provision of technical training to the affected persons to increase \ntheir skills. The PMOs and IAs will supervise implementation to ensure that vulnerable persons \nreceive adequate compensation, housing arrangements, access to the special fund and the \nminimum living guarantee, and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes.  \n \n57.  The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 9. HPG, JPG, the project county and city \ngovernments, and the IAs have implemented ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005), \nwhich requires full disclosure of the resettlement activities, by (i) distributing copies of the \nresettlement information booklet to affected households and village offices on 10 July 2008,  \n(ii) posting the resettlement plans in village offices or resident committees on 15 July 2008, and \n(iii)  posting  English  versions  of  the  resettlement  plans  on  the ADB  website  following  their \nendorsement by the project county and city governments, HPG, JPG, and the ADB Environment \nand Social Safeguard Division on 28 July 2008.  \n \n58.  ADB requires both internal and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation of the \naffected persons during implementation. The IAs will report progress regularly to the PMO, \nwhich  in  turn  will  summarize  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  progress  in  quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB. The PMO will also engage an independent monitor who will visit the \nsubprojects every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general welfare of those \naffected, (ii) make recommendations to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide advice \nto IAs and local officials. The monitor will pay special attention to vulnerable groups, including \nwomen and the poor, to assess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. \nMonitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every 6 months during implementation and \nannually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of  resettlement. These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, PMOs, and the IAs, and will be uploaded onto the ADB website.  \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n \n59.  Poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with ADB  guidelines  to  collect \ndetailed social information to inform project design and implementation. The analysis was also \nused to identify poverty reduction and social development objectives, outcomes, and indicators. \nIn addition to the socioeconomic survey, public consultations were conducted with consumer \ngroups, business communities, government agencies, people affected by the Project, and civil \nsociety organizations. A participatory approach was adopted for project design and will continue \nduring project implementation. The poverty and social analysis identified vulnerable groups and \nopportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions  and  social  action  measures,  and  outlined  the \nparticipation and mitigation plans to help achieve positive social benefits. The Summary Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy has been prepared and is provided in Appendix 10. The social \nand poverty impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n60.  The Project will directly benefit an urban population of 9.94 million including 7.04 million \nin  Heilongjiang  province  and  2.9  million  in  Jilin  province.  Of  the  total  direct  beneficiary \npopulation, about 6.85% (4.62% of the beneficiaries in Heilongjiang Province, and 12.24% of \nthose in Jilin Province) are classified as poor based on the weighted average local urban \n                                                 \n41 The base resettlement costs excluding contingencies are estimated at CNY150.6 million ($21.52 million). \n  ", "18        \npoverty line of CNY2,196 per year. Ethnic minorities are scattered across the project counties \nand cities and represent 4.1% of the population. The social analysis determined that they are \nsocially and economically integrated with the majority population and will not be subject to any \nadverse impacts of the project as a result of the their minority status.  \n \n61.  The  Project  will  lead  to:  (i)  a  better  urban  environment,  including  more  sanitation, \npollution control,  provision  of clean  water,  and  a  reduction  in  wastewater  and  solid  waste \npollution in the project counties and cities; (ii) temporary jobs during the construction phase and \npermanent jobs during the operational phase; (iii) a reduction in the incidence of water- and \nvector-related diseases, with an associated reduction in medical costs, and in the number of \nworkdays and school days lost; (iv) more environmental awareness; (v) fewer risks of pollution \nto downstream water users; (vi) value-added benefits from local procurement; and (vii) better \ninvestment conditions to stimulate the local economy to create new and to accelerate the \nrehabilitation of the ecological system of the project counties and cities. The health impact \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n62.  The  Project  will  create  6,620  person-years  of  direct  short-term  employment  with \nearnings totalling CNY89.1 million per year during the project construction phase, and 1,380 \nperson-years of direct long-term employment with wages totalling CNY18.4 million per year \nduring the project operation phase. About 30% of the short-term employment opportunities, \nincluding the jobs of manual labourers for excavation, material handling, vehicle operation, and \nfood provision, will be filled by the poor, women and minorities, earning CNY26.7 million during \nthe project construction phase.   \n \n63.  To ensure that vulnerable groups will gain maximum benefits from the Project, (i) priority \nwill be given to the vulnerable groups for the employment and training opportunities generated \nfrom  the  project  construction  and  operation  phases;  (ii)  the  selected  contractors  will  be \nsensitized to the need to provide maximum benefits to the vulnerable; and (iii) the contractors \nwill be required to adopt pro-active measures, such as quota systems and training programs for \nthe vulnerable group (e.g., the contracts of the contractors will specify that at least 15% of total \njobs and training opportunities will be provided to women and 15% to the poor and members of \nminorities).  \n \n64.  Based on the health data provided by the respective local health bureaus and the results \nof the health impact analysis, it is estimated that the annual health cost savings in 2007 directly \nfrom the urban environmental improvement in the project area of SRB totals CNY509.3 million, \nand the net present value (NPV) of health benefits during from the period 2011\u20132032 is about \nCNY908.1 million. The result is consistent with WHO reports supporting the conclusion that \nimproving water supply and sanitation can have a significant impact on human health. However, \nfor the full health benefits to be realized, close coordination will be carried out by each IA with \nthe  existing  public  environmental  awareness  and  hygiene  education  program  of  the \nenvironmental  protection  and  health  bureaus.  During  project  implementation,  a  social \ndevelopment specialist will be recruited to document and monitor the intensity of activities under \nthe public awareness programs. \n \n65.  The affordability of water and wastewater services for the poor has been assessed \nbased  on  the  proposed  tariffs  and  household  income  statistical  data.  These  indicate  that \naverage households and households in the lower income class will find the tariff increase \naffordable, since it will represent a small percentage of their total income. The impact on \nhouseholds in the lowest income bracket may be significant, but it will be mitigated through the \nexisting tariff reduction and subsidy program. These subsidies are in addition to the minimum \nliving guarantee. \n \n   ", "19 \n66.  A participatory process has been used throughout the project preparation and this will \ncontinue during project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A number of key indicators \nwill be used to monitor the poverty and social aspects of the Project.  \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n \n67.  A financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2008 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe IAs under with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)  for  the  Project  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  7.6%  for  the  water  supply \nsubprojects,  and  6.7%  for  the  wastewater  subprojects, which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 2.8%. The financial analysis is in Appendix 11, \nand the detailed financial analysis and financial projections is in Supplementary Appendix K. \nThe sensitivity analysis includes examination of the risk that (i) project costs will increase by \n10%, (ii) O&M costs will increase by 10%, and (iii) project implementation and subsequent \nrealization of benefits will be delayed by a year. An affordability analysis was undertaken based \non proposed tariffs and household income data from the social survey. Detailed verification of \nthe local financing plan indicates that the equity contributions are on average about 5% of \nannual revenues from the concerned county and city governments, indicating minimal risk. The \ncounty and city governments have sufficient financial resources to take on responsibility for \nguaranteeing the loan repayments, and have provided assurances that they accept this risk. \nTariffs  under  the  Project  are  considered  affordable  if  the  combined  average  water  and \nwastewater charges are less than 5% of monthly household income. The estimated tariffs on \nthis basis are affordable to the average household (for whom they represent 3.0% of monthly \nincome), and to the poorest 10% of households (for whom they represent less than 4% of \nmonthly income before accounting for poverty reduction measures that exist now or that have \nbeen committed to).  \n \n68.  The IAs agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included \nas loan covenants covering capital structure (debt\u2013equity), debt service cover, and liquidity.  \nFinancial  projections  estimate  the  tariffs  required  for  an  appropriate  level  of  financial \nperformance. Periodic tariff reviews will be required to overcome the risk of poor financial \nperformance or of unexpected changes in tariff income. The financial sustainability of the Project \nwas verified through a financial analysis of the IAs. Generally, the current levels of tariffs for \nwater supply and wastewater treatment in the provinces are sufficient to cover the costs of basic \noperation and maintenance. Tariffs will need to be increased to allow for full cost recovery when \nthe ADB-financed facilities come into operation. To this end, the Government has assured ADB \nthat (i) tariffs will be increased in phases and (ii) subsidies will be provided to ensure sustainable \nO&M of the project facilities. The Project will provide capacity building support for tariff reforms \nand tariff setting, and for financial management to ensure that sufficient funds are allocated for \nsustainable O&M of the project facilities. The financial sustainability of the subprojects was \ndetermined. Annual funds required for capital expenditures during project implementation, and \nO&M and debt services during operation were forecast and relevant debt coverage ratios were \nestimated. The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \n69.  The results of the financial management assessment (FMA) indicate that the EAs have \nsound financial management systems and adequate experience of managing projects funded by \nforeign  financial  institutions.  The  IAs  operate  as  state-owned  enterprises. Accounting  and \nfinancial management systems for financial reporting and accounting were adequate for loan \nimplementation, although there is potential to improve internal control procedures. As some of \nthe IAs do not have experience of working with externally funded projects, training for the IAs on \nADB procedures and requirements related to procurement, disbursement, financial reporting, \n  ", "20        \nmonitoring, internal control, financial management, and anticorruption safeguards will need to \nbe provided under the training component of the Project.  \n \nD.  Economic Aspects \n \n70.  The Project is an integral part of the ongoing provincial, municipal, and river basin \nenvironmental  programs,  contributing  significantly  to  pollution  control  in  the  SRB.  Public \nperceptions and preferences have been evaluated using household and business surveys. \nThese  showed  that  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  and  solid  waste  management \n(SWM)  rank  highest  in  priority  when  compared  with  a  range  of  other  public  services.  A \nquantitative  economic  analysis  also  demonstrates  the  value  of  the  Project.  The  economic \nanalysis was conducted for 25 years (including project construction) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated on \na with-project and without-project basis. Costs were divided into tradable and nontradable costs, \nand benefits were adjusted to account for nonincremental and incremental benefits. Incremental \neconomic  benefits  were  valued  on  the  basis  of  willingness  to  pay.  For  the  Heilongjiang \nsubprojects, the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) ranges from 13.6% to 34.7%, \nwith an average EIRR of 19.5%. For the Jilin subprojects the EIRR ranges from 17.2% to 20%, \nwith an average EIRR of 18.4%. The EIRR for the Heilongjiang and Jilin components exceeds \nthe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  assumed  at  12%.  The  economic  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 12. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n \n71.  The  Government  has  met  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002). \nExtensive public consultations involving meetings with stakeholders, focus group discussions, \nand  surveys  were  undertaken  twice  during  the  preparation  of  the  domestic  environmental \nimpact  assessments  (EIAs).  The  EIAs  summarize  the  environmental  impacts,  mitigation \nmeasures, and monitoring plans. The environmental management plan (EMP), prepared as part \nof the EIA, will guide environmental mitigation and monitoring under the Project. All the EIAs \nhave  been  approved  by  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department \n(HEPD)  and  Jilin  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department  (JEPD).  The  summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  the  EMP  have  been  confirmed  by  the \nGovernment. The SEIA concludes that the Project will have substantial positive environmental \nand socioeconomic benefits. The SEIA was circulated to the ADB Board and posted on the ADB \nwebsite on 11 July 2008.  \n   \n72.  The  environmental  benefits  of  the  Project  include:  (i)  reducing  pollution  loads  to \nSonghua River and its tributaries significantly by intercepting and treating raw sewage currently \ndischarged into the rivers and its tributaries;42 (ii) significantly improving the quality of water for \nHarbin residents by reducing wastewater discharge into the river; (iii) improving sanitation and \nhygiene by providing clean water;43 and (iv) improving the quality of life by enhancing SWM.44 \nThe  SEIA  and  EIA  reports  concluded  that  adverse  impacts  on  the  physical  and  natural \nenvironment during the construction and operational stages of the Project would be insignificant \nwhen the mitigation measures specified in the SEIAs and EMPs are appropriately implemented. \nThe incremental costs required for mitigation implementation are negligible compared with the \ncost of the Project. The two EMPs will be further detailed in the design and construction phases. \n                                                 \n42 In Fangzheng County, Fujin City, Harbin City, Jiamusi City, Nenjiang County, Qiqihar City, Shuangyashan City, and \nTangyuan County of  Heilongjiang Province and Dehui City, Gongzhuling City, Fusong County, Jingyu County, \nLiuhe County, Tonghua County, Yushu City, and Changbaishan Mountain Administrative Area of  Jilin Province.  \n43 For the residents of Fujin City, Tangyuan County, Tonghe County, and Yanshou County of Heilongjiang Province. \n44 In Da\u2019an City, Fusong County, Huadian City, Huinan County, Jiaohe City, Jingyu County, Meihekou City, Tongyu \nCounty, Yushu City, and Changbaishan Mountain Administrative Area of Jilin Province. \n   ", "21 \nThe EMPs will be implemented by IAs, monitored and supervised by professional environmental \nmanagement specialists and local environmental monitoring centers, and reported to the Jilin \nand Heilongjiang PMOs, HEPD, JEPD, and ADB. \n \nF.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n73.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for water supply, wastewater \nmanagement, and SWM. During project implementation, the consultants will support the two \nPMOs and IAs to ensure delivered equipment and works comply with the design requirements \nand  quality  standards.  The  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  or  economic \nviability, and reduce the benefits of the Project: (i) amendments and changes to the project \ncounty  and  city  master  plans;  (ii)  lack  of  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  ineffective \norganizational structures and inadequate capacity of the IAs, which could result in inefficient \nproject development and delays in implementation; (iv) delays in the provision of counterpart \nfunding; (v) failure of the project counties and cities to increase water, wastewater, and solid-\nwaste tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement \nissues, which could constrain the efficient implementation of the project works and restoration of \nlivelihoods of the affected persons. \n \n74.  Risk  (i)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronizing  the  project  design  and  implementation \nschedules with other planned projects in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, which will also have \nspecific  assurances  similar  to  those  covenanted  in  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  proposed \nProject.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  the  provision  of  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment for the IAs with the support of consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated \nthrough covenanted assurances from the project county and city governments on the provision \nof counterpart funding and regular tariff review and increases. Risk (vi) will be mitigated by \nstrengthening the internal monitoring and supervision by the two PMOs, project county and city \nPMOs, and the IAs, and by engaging a qualified external agency to monitor and evaluate \nresettlement.  Several  other  measures  will  also  help  mitigate  the  project  risks:  (i)  the \nappointment  of  project  implementation  and  monitoring  consultants,  including  environmental \nmonitoring  consultants,  (ii)  EMP  monitoring  and  mitigation  arrangements,  (iii)  EMP \nenvironmental management training, and (iv) specific assurances from the project county and \ncity governments that the project leading group and PMOs are retained for the entire loan \nimplementation period and beyond. Regarding the enforcement of environmental laws and \nregulations, the PRC is taking this very seriously and significant progress has been made on \nthis front. Upgrading the State Environmental Protection Agency into the MEP is one example of \nsuch seriousness. This is a relatively small risk and the policy dialogue and capacity building \nunder the Project would mitigate it.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n75.  In addition to the standard assurances, the PRC Government, HPG, JPG, and county \nand city governments provided the following assurances which will be incorporated into the \nLoan and Project Agreements. The full list of assurances is in the Loan and Project Agreements \nand Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart  financing.  HPG  and  JPG  will,  and  will  cause  the  concerned \ncounty/city governments to, ensure that all local cost financing including cash \ninjection and equity contribution is provided for the Project on a timely basis to \nenable the full and timely completion of the Project. HPG and JPG shall, and \n  ", "22        \nshall cause the concerned county and city governments to, ensure that in the \nevent of any shortfall of funds or cost overruns, JPG, HPG, and the concerned \ncounty and city governments shall make available such funds including foreign \nexchange as are required to complete the Project. \n \n(ii)  Financial  ratios  and  reporting.  The  HPG,  JPG,  and  county  and  city \ngovernments will ensure that IAs do not incur debt that will allow its debt to equity \nratio to be greater than 70:30. Commencing from the third year (2016) of full \ncommercial  operation  of  each  subproject,  the  HPG,  JPG,  county  and  city \ngovernments will ensure that each concerned IA maintains a ratio of current \nassets to current liabilities of not less than 1.2:1; and a debt service coverage \nratio  of  at  least  1.2  times  to  ensure  operating  efficiency  and  financial \nsustainability.   \n \n(iii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. JPG and HPG will, through the concerned \ncounty/city governments ensure that: (a) all land and rights-of-way required by \nthe Project are made available in a timely manner, (b) the resettlement plans are \nimplemented promptly and efficiently in accordance with their terms; and the \nprovisions of  the  resettlement  plans  are implemented  in  accordance  with  all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Borrower and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement,  (c)  all  affected  persons  are  given  adequate  opportunity  to \nparticipate in resettlement planning and implementation and that they will be at \nleast as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project, (d) timely \nprovision  of  counterpart  funds  be  paid  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities, and  (e)  any  obligations  in  excess of  the  resettlement  plan  budget \nestimates shall be met.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n76.  I am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $200,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Songhua River \nBasin Water Pollution Control and Management Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London-interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nC.

Water Supply for Heilongjiang Component \n \n1.  In the Songhua River Basin (SRB), serious pollution of the river has forced cities to use \ngroundwater and reservoirs as their primary source of water supply. For some cities, drinking \nwater quality still does not comply fully with national standards, e.g., for concentrations of iron \nand magnesium. Pipelines are underdeveloped. Low pressure and supply interruptions are not \nuncommon. Leaks occur frequently because of aging pipelines, which results in unaccounted for \nwater.   \n \n2.  The  central  and  provincial  governments  are  focusing  increased  attention  on  the \ninadequate and insufficient water supply in Heilongjiang.  \n \n3.  According to the statistical yearbooks of the project counties and cities, total water \nconsumption (including domestic and industrial water consumption) for each county and city \nranged from 0.7 million m3 to 2.55 million m3 for 2005 and from 0.9 million m3 to 2.55 million m3 \nfor 2006. The length of water supply network for each project county and city ranged from 23.6 \nkilometers (km) to 58.9 km in 2005 and from 26.2 km to 61 km in 2006. At present, Fujin City \nhas two water treatment plants (WTPs), Tangyuan County and Yanshou County have one WTP, \nand Tonghe County does not have any water treatment facility. All project counties and cities \nproposed one new WTP to be built during the period of the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP), with \ncapacity ranging from 9,500 m3/day to 20,000 m3/day. The proposed length of water supply \npipelines to be built during the 11th FYP period in the project counties and cities ranges from \n16.5 km to 39.7 km. \n \n4.  As  indicated  in  the  feasibility  study  reports  of  the  water  supply  subprojects  in \nHeilongjiang, the projected quantity of water demand for each project county and city by 2010 \nwill  increase  to  between  19,000  m3/day  and  40,000  m3/day,  with  water  supply  coverage \nbetween 75% and 95% of the total population. \n \nB.  Wastewater Management for Heilongjiang and Jilin \n \n5.  Because of the rapid industrialization in recent years, water quality in the SRB has \ndeteriorated seriously. In 2005, a basin-wide water quality assessment indicated that 34% of the \nmonitored sections within the Songhua River Basin had water quality at or below class V of the \nPRC National Surface Water Quality Standards (GB3838-2002). In low-flow or frozen seasons, \nthis may even increase to 45%. The most polluted tributaries include the Hulan, Anbang, \nNamo\u2019er, Huifa, Yinma, Yitong, Ashi, Woken, and Mudanjiang rivers. Water quality in these \nrivers is at class V, and this has caused significant pollution of the mainstream of the Songhua \nRiver. Some counties and cities still do not have any wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and \nthe untreated wastewater is discharged directly into local rivers which empty into the Songhua \nRiver. The lack of adequate wastewater management degrades local river water quality, poses \nthreats  to  public  health,  and  adversely  affects  the  quality  of  life  and  economic  growth  in \nHeilongjiang and Jilin provinces. Meanwhile, because of the poor water quality in the Songhua \nRiver  and  its  tributaries,  many  counties  and  cities  are  taking  groundwater  or  reservoir  as \ndrinking water sources. The proposed Project provides an integrated plan to improve the water \nsupply and wastewater management in the SRB. \n \n6.  In  the  project  counties  and  cities  of  Heilongjiang  province,  the  total  volume  of \nwastewater discharged (including domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater) ranged from \n  ", "28  Appendix 2 \n1.65 million m3 to 154.77 million m3 in 2006. The length of the sewers in each project county \nand city ranged from 6.1 km to 158.0 km in 2006. Available data indicate that none of the project \ncounties or cities have WWTPs in place, except for Harbin and Qiqihar which have two WWTPs \neach. During the period of the 11th FYP, all project counties and cities proposed one new \nWWTP to be built, with treatment capacity ranging from 6,000 m3/day to 100,000 m3/day. The \nlength of the proposed sewage networks ranges from 2.5 km to 48.5 km for the project counties \nand cities. \n \n7.  In Jilin province, the total volume of wastewater discharged for each project county and \ncity ranged from 3.36 million m3 to 26.65 million m3 in 2006. The length of sewers in the project \ncounty and cities ranged from 12.8 km to 225.0 km in 2006. None of the project counties and \ncities has a WWTP, except for Gongzhuling City which has one plant. All the project counties \nand cities have plans to build one or two WWTPs during the 11th FYP period, with treatment \ncapacity ranging from 15,000 m3/day to 100,000 m3/day. The length of proposed sewers to be \nbuilt during the same period ranges from 19.4 km to 65.9 km. \n \n8.  Recognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are essential \nfor sustainable economic growth, the Heilongjiang and Jilin provincial governments and project \ncounties  and  cities  have  incorporated  environmental  protection  as  a  first  priority  in  their \ndevelopment strategy. In the 11th FYP, both provinces plan to build more wastewater treatment \nplants. As set forth in the 11th FYP for environmental protection of Heilongjiang Province, the \nurban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded by 1.80 million m3/day, requiring a total \ninvestment of CNY5.453 billion ($790.3 million). According to the Jilin provincial 11th FYP for \nenvironmental protection, the urban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded by 1.845 \nmillion m3/day; 1,631 km of new sewage network will be built; and 491,000 m3/day of effluent \nwill be re-used, requiring a total investment of CNY5.965 billion ($864.5 million). \n \n9.  A  total  of  40  WWTPs  in  Heilongjiang  Province  and  38  in  Jilin  Province  will  be \nconstructed during the 11th FYP period as part of the Songhua River Basin Water Quality and \nPollution Control Management Plan. The feasibility study reports of each subproject, note that \nthe  projected  quantity  of  wastewater  discharged  from  each  project  county  and  city  in \nHeilongjiang Province by 2010 will range from 9,000 m3/day to 333,000 m3/day and that of Jilin \nProvince will range from 3,000 m3/day to 31,000 m3/day. The proposed Project will help the \nproject counties in Heilongjiang achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2012. It will also \nhelp the counties and cities in Jilin province achieve a 90% wastewater treatment rate by 2012. \n \n10.  The proposed WWTPs under the Project will help to (i) reduce pollutant discharge loads \nsignificantly to the tributaries of Songhua River by intercepting direct discharges of raw sewage \ninto  the  rivers,  (ii)  significantly  improve  the  water  quality  of  the  drinking  water  source  to \ndownstream counties and cities by reducing wastewater discharge into the river, (iii) improve  \nsanitation and hygiene for urban residents by improving wastewater management in project \ncounties and cities, and (iv) facilitate local sustainable economic growth by water reuse and \nimproved water quality in the receiving rivers. \n \nC.  Domestic Solid Waste Management \n \n11.  The  PRC  is  experiencing  a  fast  increase  in  solid  waste  quantities.  In  2006,  PRC \nsurpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest waste generator, and by 2030, the PRC\u2019s \nannual solid waste quantities will increase by another 150%\u2014growing from about 150 million \ntons in 2006 to over 480 million tons in 2030. The social, financial, and environmental impacts of \nthis growing waste stream are significant. By 2004, a domestic solid waste collection service \n   ", "Appendix 2  29 \nwas provided to a total population of 12 million people in the urban areas of Jilin Province. Of \nthe estimated 6.1 million tons per year total domestic solid waste generated, 94.6% of the total \nwas properly collected, and only about 17.5% of the total was disposed of properly by sanitary \nlandfills and incineration plants.  \n \n12.  There are six sanitary landfills under construction and one operational sanitary landfill in \nJilin  province  with  a  total  treatment  capacity  of  5,210  tons/day  and  a  total  investment  of  \nCNY502.5 million. The only existing sanitary landfill has a design capacity of 2,600 tons/day. \nOnly five out of 49 counties and cities in Jilin province have sanitary landfills under construction \nor operation. Under the 11th FYP, the proper disposal rate for the domestic solid waste will \nincrease from 17.5% to 60% by the end of 2010. Currently, about 250 tons/day of sludge is \ngenerated by the water treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in Jilin province. The \nsludge is disposed of in landfills operated by the municipal water service authorities. \n \n13.  The Government started to levy a solid waste disposal fee of about CNY3 to CNY5 per \nhousehold per month in the five major cities of Jilin Province in 2008. Construction of sanitary \nlandfills and waste transfer stations is a major undertaking for the government; the designed \ntotal capacity of about 2,400 tons/day under the proposed Project accounts for about 14% of the \ntotal domestic solid waste generated in Jilin province, and thus contributes significantly to \npollution controls and the Government\u2019s domestic solid waste sanitary disposal goals. \n \n \n  \n  ", "30  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n    Date of  Amount \nNo.  Name  Approval  ($ million) \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project comprises \n33 water supply, wastewater management, solid waste management (SWM), and integrated \nriver improvement subprojects in 11 counties or cities of Heilongjiang and 15 counties or cities of \nJilin  province.  The  construction  of  the  Project  will  have  significant  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts. The implementing agencies (IAs) with the support of the respective design \ninstitutes prepared five short resettlement plans, two due diligence reports, and six statements of \nland acquisition and resettlement (LAR)1 for the Heilongjiang component. Three full and 13 short \nresettlement  plans  (one  of  which  had  a  due  diligence  report)  were  prepared  for  the \nsubcomponents for Jilin component. The primary objective of the resettlement plans has been to \nensure that the affected people improve their living standards or are at least not made worse off \nbecause of the Project. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  The construction of the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management \nProject will affect 287 households or 1,523 persons by permanent land acquisition and 331 \nhouseholds or 1,067 persons by temporary land occupation. The residential and nonresidential \nhouses of 68 households or 238 persons will be demolished. In total, 272.6 hectares (ha) of land \nwill  be  affected  permanently,  33%  of  which  (90.2  ha)  is  cultivated  land;  125.5  ha  of  rural \ncollective  and  state  land  will  be  occupied  temporarily;  and  11,180.6  m2  of  residential  and \nnonresidential structures will be demolished. \n \n  Table A9.1: Summary Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \nTotal Area  Of which  Affected  Affected \nType of Impact \n(ha/m2)  Farmland (ha)  Households (no.)

For the Heilongjiang component, the subcomponents will affect 41 households or 149 \npersons by permanent land acquisition and 162 households or 529 persons by temporary land \noccupation. The demolition of residential structures will lead to the relocation of 14 households \nor 51 persons. In total, 68 ha of land will be affected permanently, 40.4% of which is cultivated \nland; 54.7 ha of rural and state land will be occupied temporarily; and 2,035.6 m2 of residential \n                                                 \n1 Statements here refer to the subcomponents that involve state-owned land to be acquired. They do not include land \nowned by village committees or farmers\u2019 households that are affected. \n ", "54  Appendix 9 \nhouses  will  be  demolished.  For  the  Jilin  component,  the  construction  of  the  proposed \nsubprojects will affect 246 households or 1,374 persons by permanent land acquisition and 169 \nhouseholds or 538 persons by temporary land occupation. Demolition of buildings, including two \nenterprises and two shops, will require the relocation of 54 households or 187 persons. Of the \ntotal  affected  persons,  10  households  or  19  persons  are  from  vulnerable  groups.  In  total,  \n204.6 ha of land will be affected permanently, of which 30.6% is cultivated land; 70.8 ha of rural \ncollective and state land will be occupied temporarily, including 31.5% of cultivated land; and \n9,145  m2  of  houses  will  be  demolished.  In  addition,  associated  productive  assets,  ground \nattachments,  and  basic  infrastructures  and  facilities  will  be  affected  as  result  of  both  the \nHeilongjiang  and  Jilin  components.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, there was close consultation with the local officials and village committees and \nstreet committees during the preliminary and final feasibility study, and during the preliminary \ndesign stages.  \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework   \n \n4.  Compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPRC  (1998)  and  the  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land \nAdministration (Document 28 dated in November 2004). Compensation for house demolition is \nbased  on  the  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment  Administration \nRegulations. The resettlement plans comply with PRC laws and regulation of resettlement and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Based on consultations with local governments \nand those affected, and general practice in relevant counties or cities, a set of compensation \nstandards was adopted by the respective county or city project management offices (PMOs) and \nIAs.  The  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible by using alternative \ndesigns; (ii) compensation and entitlements are based on replacement value and must be \nsufficient to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-project standard of living, with the \nprospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  the  amount  of  land  temporarily  occupied  and  the  period  for \ndisruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all the people affected, legal and illegal, are to be \ntaken into consideration and accounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after land acquisition \nshould be sufficient to maintain previous livelihood standards; (vi) where land allocation per \ncapita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-generating \nactivities will be provided for; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups with \nregard to compensation, payment of special fund, minimum living guarantee, and employment; \n(viii) all those affected will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and \nstandards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring \nand timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems.  \n \nD.  Compensation, Income, and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n \n5.  For land acquisition, land compensation will be paid in cash to the affected villages to be \nused for improving village infrastructure and farming conditions. A resettlement subsidy and \nstanding crops will be paid to the affected persons. For residential houses and nonresidential \n(enterprises  and  shops)  houses  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be  paid  to  owners, \nincluding those without house certificates. The payment will be made in cash according to the \nappraised value of the property. Households that have to relocate will also receive a relocation \nallowance. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will also be paid \ndirectly to the affected persons. Income losses resulting from reduced production sales and \nwages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \n   ", "Appendix 9  55 \n \n6.  The resettlement strategy encompasses (i) the replacement of housing, and (ii) the \nrestoration of livelihoods and income. For people losing housing in rural areas, there are two \nresettlement options\u2014to receive cash compensation or cash compensation plus provision of \nhouse plot for house construction by  themselves. Assistance will be provided to enable affected \npersons to construct new houses or find available housing close to their original homes, if that is \ntheir preference. The respective county or city PMOs, IAs and local governments will provide \nassistance for house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. \n \n7.  The  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include:  (i)  provision  of  employment \nopportunities during construction and operational phases; (ii) provision of basic social insurance \nto affected persons whose land is newly acquired; (iii) development of economic crops with \nhigher economic value; (iv) promotion and development of new enterprises and self-employed \nsecondary  and  tertiary  businesses  (e.g.,  auto  accessory  manufacturing  plants,  community \nservices,  hairdressing  salons,  dry-cleaning  businesses,  small-scale  supermarkets, \ntransportation, entertainment and catering services); and (v) provision of technical training to the \naffected persons to increase their skills.  \n \n8.  The survey results indicate that nine households and 28 persons are vulnerable people \naffected by construction of four subprojects in Jilin Province. For these vulnerable people, the \nrespective municipal PMOs and IAs will establish a special assistance one-time payment of \nCNY2,000 per capita for them to improve their living standards. In addition, the vulnerable \nhouseholds will be provided with additional assistance for their relocation and rehabilitation. The \nPMO and IA will supervise implementation to ensure these vulnerable persons receive adequate \ncompensation,  housing  arrangements,  special  assistance  payments  and  livelihood \narrangements, and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n \nE.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n \n9.  The people affected were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan before \nADB  loan  fact-finding.  On  various  occasions  during  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local \nrepresentatives  and  affected  persons  have  participated  in  the  planning  process  and  their \nconcerns have been integrated into the resettlement plans. The resettlement information booklet \nfor  each  subproject  has  been  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  households.  The  final \nresettlement plans have been provided to village offices and resident committees and posted on \nthe ADB website on 28 July 2008. The project IAs will establish project resettlement units to \nsupervise implementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress and responding to \ngrievances.  The  grievance  address  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets. \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangement and implementation Schedule \n \n10.  Each PMO will have at least one person and each IA will have at least two full-time staff \nresponsible for land acquisition and resettlement. Staff from each subproject resettlement unit \nwill take the lead in coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of land \nacquisition and resettlement. They will work closely with village officials, land resource bureaus \nand  house  demolition  administration  offices,  and  will  be  responsible  for  supervision  and \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration of incomes, provision of replacement land and other economic measures). A training \nprogram will be organized for the resettlement officers.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 9 \nG.  Budget \n \n11.  The total costs for the LAR are estimated at CNY238.1 million ($34 million), including a \ncontingency.  Of  the  total  LAR  costs,  CNY46.0  million  ($6.6  million)  is  for  the  Heilongjiang \ncomponent and CNY192.1 million ($27.4 million) for the Jilin component. The estimated costs \ninclude compensation for permanent land acquisition, temporary land occupation, demolition of \nresidential houses and auxiliaries, relocation allowance, basic infrastructure and special facilities, \nland-related  taxes,  training,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  contingency  and  other  costs.  \nResettlement implementation will precede construction schedules. Most resettlement activities \nwill occur between February 2008 and December 2009.  Resettlement implementation will be \ncompleted before subproject construction. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in \neach  village,  neighborhood,  enterprise,  and  shop,  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be \nnegotiated and signed with village committees, households and enterprises. Based on these \nsurveys, the resettlement plans will be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval \nbefore commencement of construction activities if there are changes to the scope of the LAR or \npolicies. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Supervision \n \n12.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. \nMonitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement  plans.  Internal  supervision  and \nmonitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement \nplan. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with ADB, to ensure \ntimely and effective implementation of resettlement activities. External monitoring and evaluation \nwill be carried out by an independent agency under contract to the PMO of Heilongjiang and Jilin \nprovince.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during \nimplementation  and  annually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  External \nmonitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMOs, IAs, and ADB and will be uploaded on \nADB website. \n \n \n   ", "Appendix 10  57 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  East Asia Department, Social \nProject Loan \nModality:  Division:  Sectors Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nThe Songhua River is a crucial watershed and priority development and environmental zone for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) Government, as noted in the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP). The Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and \nManagement Project (SRBWPCMP) will improve environmental quality in the SRB and enhance the quality of life for 9.94 \nmillion people in the participating counties and cities of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces. The Project is consistent with the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) water policy. It will help the PRC achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of \nenvironmental sustainability (MDG Goal 7), and specifically address MDG Target 10 (to halve the proportion of people \nwithout sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015). The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy in the PRC to make markets work more efficiently through (i) urban infrastructure development, (ii) \npromotion of environmental sustainability, and (iii) pro-poor equitable and inclusive growth. The Project is consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities in the 11th FYP of addressing environmental issues including water and air pollution. \n \nThe SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. It has a catchment area of 556,800 \nsquare kilometers (km2) and serves a population of approximately 62 million. The urbanization rate for the area is relatively \nhigh, with 50% of the population living in counties and cities of SRB. The SRBWPCMP will improve water pollution control \nand drinking water sources in the SRB through the provision of clean and stable water supplies, wastewater and solid waste \nmanagement and integrated river rehabilitation. It will upgrade the urban environment in the project counties and cities of \nHeilongjiang and Jilin provinces. In turn, it will also provide an enabling environment for poverty reduction directly and \nindirectly in the project areas by promoting:  \n(i)  improved urban environmental conditions and enhanced sanitation through pollution control in the SRB;  \n(ii)  increased employment and income generation opportunities, including temporary job creation during the \nconstruction phase and permanent job creation during the operational phase;  \n(iii)  increased environmental awareness and public hygiene;  \n(iv)  reduction in the incidence of water-, vector- and air-borne diseases, with associated reductions in medical \ncosts, and in the number of workdays and school days lost;  \n(v)  increased yields and values of irrigated crops, fishery and animal husbandry;  \n(vi)  reduced risks of pollution to downstream water users;  \n(vii)  value-added benefits from using local procurement to the extent possible;  \n(viii)  improved investment conditions to stimulate the development of local economy, create new jobs and income \ngenerating opportunities and accelerate the rehabilitation of the ecological system of the Project counties and \ncities;  \n(ix)  accelerated development of the tourism industry in the project counties and cities;  \n(x)  increased land and property values for local residents in the Project areas; and, \n(xi)  provision of low-cost water for industrial uses which in turn could reduce the price of associated products.  \n \nEnvironmental and socioeconomic benefits will accrue to the local populations in the SRB, thus enhancing their quality of life \nand health. Benefits will be felt especially by the poor who are most vulnerable to environment-related diseases and poor \nurban environments. Vulnerable populations and women will be particularly targeted for employment opportunities generated \nby the project investments. The Project will complement the PRC\u2019s efforts to ensure environmental sustainability and reduce \nurban poverty. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                       Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention (M7 T10)   \n1.  Key Issues \nThe Project is classified as MDG-TI. It directly addresses MDG 7 to ensure environmental sustainability and particularly \nTarget 10 to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \nIt will benefit more than 9.94 million urban residents in the project areas of SRB, of whom 6.85% or 680,890 persons are \npoor and currently living under the minimum living guarantee (MLG) which ranges from CNY145 to CNY245 per capita per \nmonth in Heilongjiang Province and from CNY100 to CNY143 per capita per month in Jilin Province. The social analysis \nrevealed that these poor are mostly living in areas without running water supplies, wastewater and solid waste collection and \ntreatment services. They often suffer from serious water supply shortages, poor water quality, wastewater pollution, and \npoor urban environmental sanitation. They have less capacity to cope with the pollution and degraded environments and in \nturn suffer from increased exposure and risks to surface and ground water and air pollution, which further add to their \npoverty. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \nThrough the provision of clean and stable water supply and wastewater management, solid waste management, and \nintegrated river rehabilitation components in the project counties and cities, the Project will improve the living environment \nand health status of the local urban residents. The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities in the 11th FYP of \naddressing environmental issues, including water and air pollution. The poor who are most vulnerable to environment-related \ndiseases and poor urban environments and lack of financial resources will receive environmental and socioeconomic \nbenefits from the Project. They will particularly benefit from the targeted employment opportunities. \n2. Design Features \nThe designs for all subprojects have attempted to reduce impacts on land acquisition and resettlement. The resettlement \nplans, in consultation with local communities, have outlined and agreed upon the mitigation plans. Project assurances \nensure targets for employment of local labor, especially the poor, women, and ethnic minorities (20%). The Social Action \nPlans (SAPs) outline strategies for mitigating adverse impacts and promoting positive benefits such as employment, initiating \ncommunity-based environmental and hygiene awareness programs and ensuring HIV/AIDS awareness training is carried out \nby contractors. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe Project will directly benefit more than 9.94 million urban residents in the project areas of the SRB (including 7.04 million \nurban residents in the direct project area (DPA) of Heilongjiang province and 2.9 million urban residents in the DPA of Jilin \nprovince). Of the total beneficiary populations, about 48% are women, 6.85% (4.62% in Heilongjiang Province, and 12.24% \nin Jilin Province) are classified as poor based on the weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY183 per month, and \n4.1% are members of ethnic minorities scattered across the project counties and cities. \n \nHealth Benefits. The implementation of the Project will lead to an improvement in the clean water supply and in wastewater \nand solid waste collection and treatment. It will contribute to a reduction in morbidity and mortality rates from water-, vector- \nand airborne diseases and contribute to savings in associated medical costs and the loss of healthy working days. Health is \noften both a cause and a result of poverty. Health sector studies in the PRC have shown that infectious and parasitic \ndiseases particularly afflict the poor. The poorest quintile suffers three times the infectious disease rate of the wealthiest \nquartile. As the poor are often elderly and disabled, they are more susceptible to diseases and have less financial capability \nto cope with the costs associated with them. A public environment and hygiene awareness program in parallel with the \nexisting environment and health programmes and close coordination with the environmental protection bureaus and health \nbureaus in the project counties and cities will be carried out during the implementation of the Project.  \n \nEmployment Benefits. The Project will create 6,620 person-years of direct short-term employment during the construction \nphase and 1,380 direct long-term jobs during the operation phase. Based on discussions with the implementing agencies \n(IAs), it has been agreed that, of the total employment generated, a target of 30% short-term employment opportunities will \nbe filled by the poor and minorities (15%) and women (15%) during the construction phase (earning CNY26.74 million) and \nlong-term employment opportunities during the operation phase (earning CNY5.52 million) will be adopted. These jobs are \nmost likely to be filled by currently laid-off or unemployed persons, meaning that the poor will particularly benefit from this job \ncreation.  \n \nAffordability. The affordability assessment indicates that the average households and households in the lowest income \nclass will not be adversely affected by the tariff increase since the share of income expended on the service is below 5% of \ntheir total income. The impact on households in the lowest income bracket can be potentially significant but will be mitigated \nthrough the existing tariff reduction and subsidy program. These subsidies are in addition to the minimum living guarantee. \nThe results of the focus group discussion for the poor groups indicate that the poor households support the improved \nservices if they can afford the tariff increase.  \n \nEthnic Minorities. Ethnic minorities represent a small percentage of the total population (4.1%) and are scattered across the \nproject counties and cities. The social analysis determined that they are socially and economically integrated with the \nmajority population and will not be subject to any adverse impacts of the Project as a result of their minority status, including \nland acquisition and resettlement. Priority will be given to them for employment. \n \nIn addition, improved health and quality of life will improve the human capital and promote local economic development. The \ncurrent loss of agricultural, fishery and animal husbandry production and lower prices of agricultural, fishery and animal \nhusbandry products can be mitigated through the improved quality of water. The improved water quality and urban \nenvironment will promote sustainable economic development and accelerate the development of tourism. The poor and \nwomen are particularly likely to find opportunities in this industry. \n \n   ", "Appendix 10  59 \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. The technical assistance (TA) used various participatory methods for poverty and social impact assessment, including a \nrandom  sampling  socioeconomic  survey  of  1,000  respondents  in  both  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  provinces,  stakeholder \nconsultation workshops, meetings, seminars, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews on issues related to \nprevention  and  control  of  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  solid  waste  management,  and  integrated  river \nrehabilitation subcomponents. Development of the summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) involved two rounds of public consultation. Separate socioeconomic surveys, community meetings, \nopinion surveys and specific impact studies were conducted for the resettlement plans. The EMP and resettlement plans set \nout detailed ongoing public participation plans.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing         Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nPublic disclosure of all project documents at the PMO and on the ADB website including the project information document \n(PID), design and monitoring framework (DMF), resettlement plans, SEIA, report and recommendation of the President \n(RRP), public sector legal agreement, project administration memorandum (PAM), social and environmental monitoring \nreports are available or will be available after approval. A PID has been prepared for each subproject. Resettlement \ninformation booklets outlining the resettlement plans have been distributed to each affected household and disclosure \nmeetings have been held. Copies of the booklets have been available at the respective PMO offices, and each affected \nvillage office. To enhance the environmental and health benefits of the Project, a public environment and hygiene awareness \nprogram in the communities in parallel with the existing environment and health programmes and in close coordination with \nthe environmental protection bureaus and health bureaus in the project counties and cities will be carried out during \nimplementation.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nResults from the household survey and focus group discussion indicate that women are primarily responsible for collection of \nhousehold water, wastewater disposal and management, household garbage disposal and management, and care for the \nsick and elderly. Time and efforts spent on these activities will be significantly reduced, enabling women to be engaged in \nincome-generating activities and family or leisure time. Lack of water supply, wastewater disposal and collection, and solid \nwaste disposal and collection contribute to gender inequities and add to the burden of household work. The poverty and \nsocial assessment indicates that women strongly support the Project across all of the subprojects. Women have perceived \nthat the Project will improve their living environments, create employment opportunities, and reduce the incidence of water-, \nvector- and airborne diseases. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n  Gender plan           Other actions/measures         No action/measure \nProject assurances prioritize women for employment and skills training. Of the total employment generated, a 15% target \nhas been set for women during the project construction and operation phases. This has been agreed to by the IAs and will \nbe monitored by the Project. Job training will be provided at the beginning of their employment. Core labor standards and an  \nHIV/AIDS awareness training are included for all contractors in the loan assurances. The community-based environmental \nand hygiene awareness program will directly address women\u2019s needs and health risks. \n \n \nIII.

Introduction \n \n1.  Financial analysis was carried out in accordance with the Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects (2005) of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB). Cost estimates were made \nin domestic currency units, with foreign exchange costs converted into yuan at the projected \npurchasing  power  parity  exchange  rate,  taking  into  consideration  the  potential  impacts  of \ninternational and domestic inflation. Taxes and duties have been disclosed as part of the base \ncosts. The projected financial statements for each subproject were prepared in current terms for \nthe period 2008 to 2017 to cover the construction period and several years of commercial \noperation. Construction is assumed to be completed in about 4 years for each subproject, \nfollowed by a year of trial operations.   \n \n2.  An assessment of the financial management capability of the executing agencies (EAs) \nand implementing agencies (IAs) of each subproject was made. The EAs have sound financial \nmanagement  systems  and  adequate  experience  of  managing  projects  funded  by  foreign \nfinancial institutions. The IAs operate as state-owned enterprises. The accounting and financial \nmanagement systems of IAs for financial reporting and accounting were adequate for loan \nimplementation, although there is potential to improve internal control procedures. As some of \nthe IAs may have no experience of externally funded projects, training on ADB procedures and \nrequirements  related  to  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  reporting,  monitoring,  internal \ncontrol, and anticorruption safeguards will need to be provided under the Project.  \n \nB.   Financial Analysis \n \n  1.  Financial Forecast \n \n3.  Based on previous financial statements, financial models were developed for all of the \nsubprojects to assess their current financial situation and to forecast their performance during \nthe construction period and up to several years of operations. The major assumptions used to \ncalculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were: (i) all calculations are made in 2008 \nprices; (ii) capital costs include all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction \nand purchase of equipment under the project, but exclude price contingencies and interest \nduring  construction;  (iii)  operating  and  maintaining  costs  include  all  annual  incremental \nexpenses incurred in operating the facilities, but exclude depreciation and debt repayment \nprovisions; and (iv) operating revenues from tariffs used in the financial projections are also \nadjusted to 2008 prices. Overall, the FIRR for the water supply subprojects computed on an \nafter-tax basis is 7.6% and 6.7% for wastewater subprojects.  \n \n2.   Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) \n \n4.  The WACC has been calculated in real terms for each subproject. Funding sources are \nthe ADB loan, counterpart funds from the Government, and state bonds. In addition to these \nsources, domestic loans will also be used to finance selected water supply subprojects. For the \nADB loan, the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.20% \nwas used. An estimated interest cost of 7.8% per annum was used for the domestic loan funds, \nwhile the opportunity cost of equity and state bonds was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt \nwas also adjusted to reflect the impact of income taxes of 25%. \n \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nTable A11: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nFinancing Component\nDomestic \nItem ADB Loan Loan Government Equity Total\nA.

The subprojects are considered financially viable and sustainable. \nSensitivity  tests  were  conducted  under  various  adverse  conditions  that  would  cause  the \nsubprojects\u2019 FIRR to fall below the WACC. The results of the sensitivity tests indicate that these \nconditions are unlikely to occur.  \n \n3.   Projected Tariffs  \n \n6.  The existing tariff will be reviewed and increased gradually to a level that will ensure full \ncost  recovery.  The  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  tariffs  will  be \nincreased periodically during the implementation period through the Government\u2019s consultative \nprocess, including public hearing and assessment of affordability for domestic users, especially \nfor low-income households. In addition, the IAs will take measures to improve their operations to \naddress system losses and nonrevenue water, and to improve the efficiency of collection. \nImplementation of these measures will be appropriately covenanted.  \n \n \n \n \n   ", "Appendix 12        63 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Policies, Targets, Rationale, and Tariffs \n \n1.  The  Songhua  River  Basin  (SRB)  is seriously  polluted and  is acknowledged by  the \nMinistry of Environmental Protection (MEP) to be one of the four most polluted river basins in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Water pollution issues in the SRB, especially in relation \nto the protection of drinking water resources for the municipality of Harbin, have received \nincreased national and international attention due to a widely publicized pollution incident in the \nSRB in November and December 2005. The Songhua River is contaminated with a number of \nknown and suspected trace organic chemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants, and is \nclassified by the Government as class IV1 (falling below class V during the 6-month low-flow \nwinter season), and is considered unsuitable for municipal domestic water use.  \n \n2.  In 2006, with the approval of the State Council, the SRB Water Pollution Prevention and \nControl Master Plan (SRBPCMP) was released by the MEP. A total of 40 wastewater treatment \nplants (WWTPs) will be constructed in Heilongjiang province and 38 in Jilin province during the \n11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP)  period  as  part  of  the  SRBPCMP.  Recognizing  that  adequate \nenvironmental protection and pollution controls are essential for sustainable economic growth, \nthe Heilongjiang and Jilin provincial governments and project counties and cities have made \nenvironmental protection one of the main priorities in their development strategies. In the 11th \nFYP, both provinces plan to build more WWTPs. As set forth in the 11th FYP for environmental \nprotection of Heilongjiang province, the urban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded \nby 1.80 million cubic meters per day (m3/day) requiring a total investment of CNY5.453 billion \n($790.3 million). According to the Jilin provincial 11th FYP for environmental protection, the \nurban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded by 1.845 million m3/day; 1,631 kilometers \n(km) of new sewage network will be built; and 491,000 m3/day of effluent will be re-utilized, \nrequiring a total investment of CNY5.965 billion ($864.5 million). \n \n3.  In  theory,  market  mechanisms  such  as  permits  and  taxes  can  be  used  to  control \nemissions efficiently. However, in the water and solid waste sectors, neither a tradable permit \nsystem nor a pollution tax attain the least-cost solution in the way that theory suggests, because \nof regulated firms\u2019 strategic behavior, regulatory capture, and asymmetric information (between \nthe regulator and the firms). Limited private sector investment is expected since the cost-based \npricing rule will be used in utility sectors, given the pressure on the Government from inflation  \nand the need to ensure distributional justice. The investment by this project will not crowd out \nprofit-driven private sector investments.  \n \n4.  As for tariff reform, in addition to the goals of safe and affordable water for all and \nmaximum net social benefits, there are several key criteria, such as financial sustainability, the \nuser pays principle, simplicity, and transparency. Typically, water supply, wastewater and solid \nwaste sectors are only covered from their operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and a \nfraction of capital costs. Historical tariffs were often established by price bureaus in a political \nprocess that has resulted in insufficient revenues and a need for subsidies from the municipality. \nThere  are  at  least  four  reasons  for  a  periodic  review  and  gradual  increase  in  tariffs:  \n(i) mandatory public hearings, (ii) ensuring a good tariff collection rate, (iii) higher tariffs for \nresidential users to eliminate the industry to household cross-subsidy eventually, and (iv) a \nreasonable  level  of  profitability  for  the  utility  companies  in  order  to  encourage  private \n                                                 \n1 The PRC water quality standards have five classes of quality covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is \npristine, while class V is suitable only for industrial use.   \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \nparticipation. The concern with distributional justice should not be a problem, since even under \nthe most stringent circumstances, the average household would pay 1.5% to 2.9% of income for \nservices, while the poor household would pay only 2.2% to 3.6%.  \n \nB.  Demand Forecast and Least Cost Analysis \n \n5.  A demand forecast for each subproject was carried out by the Executing Agency (EA) \nand the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants. This concluded that the \nrisk associated with the demand forecast is minimal because the project\u2019s supply will be lower \nthan the total demands for water supplies and wastewater treatment services in the six cities \nand five counties2 in Heilongjiang province. \n \n6.  Two methods, lowest average incremental economic cost (AIEC) and net present value \neconomic cost (NPVEC), are applied in the least-cost analysis for Heilongjiang province. All \ncosts  and  outputs  are  derived  from  a  with-project  and  without-project  comparison,  and \ndiscounted at the economic discount rate of 12%. The NPVEC equalizes net present value \nincluding incremental capital investment costs and O&M costs, and the AIEC is the net present \nvalue of incremental capital investment costs and O&M costs divided by the present value of \nincremental output. For water sources comparison, the ground water source is found to be more \ncost-effective than the surface water option. For the wastewater treatment process for Harbin \nCity Xinyigou District WWTP, it is concluded that the A2O process is the best process. However, \nfor the Qiqihar City WWTP, the CASS process is found to be more cost-effective than the A2O \nprocess.  \n \n7.  Least-cost analyses of the Jilin component confirm the proposed technologies and sites \nare the least-cost options. For example, in several of the WWTP subprojects, Biolak and A2O \ntechnologies were compared. Using the equalizing discount rate approach, it is found that the \nBiolak option always has a lower discounted cost stream between 4% and 15% discount rate. In \nproject site selection, all subprojects carefully selected the sites with lowest land acquisition \ncost, treatment cost, and negative spillovers for local residents. \n \nC.  General Parameters \n \n8.  The economic analysis is on a 25-year basis inclusive of the project construction period. \nEconomic  benefits  and  costs  are  denoted  in  terms  of  the  domestic  price  numeraire  and \nexpressed in constant 2007 prices. International costs are converted to local currency costs at \nan exchange rate of CNY7.0 per $1, and are adjusted annually based on a purchasing power \nparity assumption. Project costs and benefits are estimated on a without- and with-project basis \nappropriately apportioned on the basis of nonincremental and incremental project effects in \naccordance with the ADB Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.  Tradable  components  are  adjusted  to \neconomic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.013, and nontraded components are \nvalued at domestic market prices.  \n \nD.  Costs \n \n9.  Base costs plus physical contingencies of the Project and each of the subproject capital \ncosts have been estimated and apportioned on the basis of tradable, nontradable, and skilled \nand unskilled labor costs. Similarly, O&M costs for each subproject and the overall Project are \n                                                 \n2 The six cities are Fujin, Harbin, Jiamusi, Qiqihar, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan. The five counties are Fangzheng, \nNenjiang, Tonghe, Yanshou, and Tangyuan. \n   ", "Appendix 12        65 \nestimated, apportioned on the basis of tradable and nontradable works, consumables, services, \nequipment  and  machinery,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  valued  in  economic  prices, i.e., \nshadow  wage  rate  factors.  Additional  conversion  factors  are  used  when  necessary  and \nappropriate.3 Domestic transfer payments are excluded in the valuation of the cost estimates in \neconomic prices. Physical contingencies are added to capital costs. \n \nE.  Project Benefits \n \n10.  The monitoring results and water pollution episodes strongly suggest serious water \npollution damage in SRB. Previous research and field investigations by the consultants suggest \nthat there are three broad categories of water pollution damage: damage to public health; \ndamage to the surrounding ecosystems including agriculture and fisheries; and other damage, \nincluding to industrial production and residential property values. The project\u2019s primary benefits \nfor water-related subprojects include the following.   \n \n(i)  Public  health  benefits.  These  may  include  reduced  incidence  of  cancer, \ndiarrhea, and respiratory ailments.  \n(ii)  Agricultural,  aquacultural,  and  husbandry  benefits.  Use  of  sewage  or \npolluted water for irrigation leads to lower production and lower product quality; \nuse of polluted grain as food or animal fodder results in damage to health. \n(iii)  Industry cost savings. There will be less need to treat polluted water, and \nproduct quality will improve. \n(iv)  Industrial water shortages. Water pollution directly influences the quality of \nsome industrial products, so a better water supply leads to economic benefits.  \n(v)  Industrial  relocation  cost  savings.  Assuming  enforcement  of  industrial \npollution abatement standards, fewer industrial facilities would have to relocate \nbecause of the cost of constructing on-site treatment facilities to achieve effluent \ndischarge standards.  \n(vi)  Factory resource cost savings. A better centralized wastewater collection and \ntreatment system will lead to savings in on-site treatment costs by industry. \n(vii)  Land and property value increases. The provision of wastewater collection \nservices to existing and future residential areas within the project area will greatly \nincrease the value of these properties. \n \n11.  The categories and components of the economic costs are summarized in Table A12.1.  \n \n                                                 \n3 A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used.  Border prices were used for all imported items, 2.0 for skilled labor, \nand 0.67 for unskilled labor.  Taxes and duties were excluded.  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the \nestimated value of the best alternative utilization).   \n ", "66  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.1: Water Pollution Costs \nTypes of Effect  Damage  Parameters  Method used \nDamage to health  Hospital  Hepatitis,  Calibrated dose-response, using comparison with \nadmissions,  dysentery, cancer  clean area and literature assessments, treatment \nmedicine,   costs from local statistics \nSick leaves  Hepatitis,  Loss of working days for patients and others from \n \ndysentery, cancer  local statistics, GDP/day \nPremature  Cancer  Loss of production due to early death, willingness to \n \ndeaths   pay \nDrinking water    Cost of additional treatment during high pollution \n \ntreatment  periods; additional treatment by households \nDamage to crops  Grains,  Reduced amount  Studies of the effect of using polluted irrigation \nvegetables  water, value of crop \n    Reduced quality  Violating standards for selected contaminants, value \nof crop discarded \nDamage to fishery    Reduced catch due  Value of stock depletion \nto pollution \nDamage to       Loss of animals \nEstimates from other areas, values of lost animals \nhusbandry  due to pollution \nDamage to    Water shortage  Estimated amount of water shortage; value of \nindustry  production per ton water \nReal estate   Residence  Housing price \nEstimated decrease of land and house values \nquality \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n12.  SRB is also facing great environmental challenges from the lack of solid waste treatment \ncapacities.  Solid  waste  disposal  and  management  projects  are  primarily  concerned  with \nenvironmental health hazards created by the lack of waste collection services in less developed \nareas or the inappropriate handling of solid waste at landfill sites. Landfills in most municipalities \nand townships within the SRB urgently need to be expanded or new landfills need to be \nestablished at other locations. Most existing landfill facilities are already operating beyond the \nfull capacity and are located in areas with large populations. The suggested alternatives in the \nFSRs will meet sanitary standards as the best alternative, based on environmental impact \nconsiderations. Both the WTP approach and direct environmental benefit valuation approach \nyield sufficiently high economic return to justify the subprojects. The benefits of the solid waste \nprojects are listed in Table A12.2.   \n \n   ", "Appendix 12        67 \nTable A12.2: Economic Benefits of Solid Waste Management \n  Impacts and Unit Values  Aggregate Economic Value \nCategory  (CNY)  (CNY/annum) \nHealth effects from  Restricted Activity Days 225,   Mortality: 16,505,000  \ngroundwater pollution   YOLL acute effects 465,000,   Morbidity: 9,134,800  \nYOLL chronic effects 252,000 ECU  \nAgricultural effects from air  Damage costs via:   Agricultural damage: 301,500 \npollution   SO  0.00042 CNY/ton of MSW  \n2\nNO 0.3587 CNY/ ton of MSW  \nVisual and odor  Number of affected households: 400,000 hh   Disamenity value: \u2245 40 million \ndisamenity   Average Impact: CNY 100 hh/year  \nGlobal warming   External valuation for 1 tonne CO : $3.6    Global warming damage: $1,959,200 \n2\n(or CNY13,714,000) \n   \nTotal Monetary Costs   CNY79,655,300 per annum \nCO  = carbon dioxide, hh = households, MSW = municipal solid waste, NO = nitrogen oxide, SO  = sulfur dioxide, \n2 2\nYOLL = years of life lost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  In  the  current  study,  to  avoid  possible  double  counting,  land  and  property  value \nappreciation is not included in the quantification because visual and odor disamenity reduction \nis added. Note further that the average disamenity value per household is assumed at CNY100 \nper year, which is very conservative (in studies on developed countries, it can be over \u20ac300). \nNevertheless, the aggregate disamenity reduction value is still quite high because of the large \nnumber of affected households.   \n \n14.  The demand forecast is in line with the empirical research on the relationship between \nsolid waste growth and gross domestic product (GDP) growth,4 which has found that for every \n1% increase in GDP, there is a 0.4056% increase in solid waste. This study showed that there is \na unilateral casual relationship between GDP growth and solid waste growth in the PRC.  \n \nF.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n15.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Heilongjiang component is calculated \nfor each subproject and for the whole component. The EIRR calculation takes into account only \nthe  main  benefits  of  different  components  but  includes  all  project-related  costs.5  For  the \nsubprojects,  this  approach  yields  EIRRs  that  range  from  13.6%  to  36.9%.  For  the  whole \ncomponent, the EIRR is 19.6%. For the Heilongjiang component, sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe EIRR will decrease to (i) 17.5% if the whole project experiences a capital cost overrun of \n10%; (ii) 15.0% if the benefits are reduced by 10%; (iii) 17.1% if the commissioning year of the \nProject is delayed by one year; (iv) 11.5% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen. Table A12.3 summarizes \nthe EIRRs for the Heilongjiang subprojects. \n \n                                                 \n4  Song, P. et al. 2007. Study on the Quantity Relations between the Growth of Solid Waste and the Economy of \nChina, Environmental Science and Management, 32 (9): 72-75  \n5  The health and environmental benefits are the major benefits for wastewater treatment components. However, if \nthe WTP is used, health benefits should be removed from the benefits, partly to avoid double counting, unless the \nWTP does not cover positive externality effects of the health benefits. To be conservative, the calculation analysis \ndid not include health benefits because the WTP was used in all the components whenever it is applicable.  \n \n ", "68  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.3: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (Heilongjiang Subprojects) \nSubprojects  EIRR (%)\nFujin City Water Supply Expansion  28.0 \nTangyuan County Water Supply  14.5 \nTonghe County Water Supply Expansion  17.4 \nYanshou County Water Supply Expansion  15.6 \nFangzheng County WWTP + Sewerage Network  15.2 \nFujin City WWTP  19.2 \nHarbin City Xinyigou District WWTP  14.1 \nJiamusi City East District WWTP + Effluent Reuse  34.7 \nNenjiang County WWTP + Sewerage Network  25.7 \nQiqihar City WWTP (Phase II)  36.9 \nQitaihe City Effluent Reuse  15.7 \nShuangyashan City WWTP  14.2 \nTangyuan County WWTP  13.6 \nHeilongjiang Component  19.6 \n EIRR = economic internal rate of return, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \n Source: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n16.  The EIRR for the Jilin component is calculated for each subproject and for the whole \ncomponent.  The  EIRR  calculation  takes  into  account  only  the  main  benefits  of  different \ncomponents but includes all project-related costs. For the subprojects, this approach yields \nEIRRs ranging from 16.4% to 20.0%. For the whole component, the EIRR is 18.4%. Sensitivity \nanalyses are performed for each subproject (details in Supplementary Appendix L). For the \nEIRR of the whole Project, sensitivity analysis shows the EIRR will decrease to (i) 16.4% if the \nProject experiences a cost overrun of 10%; (ii) 15.8% if the benefits are reduced by 10%;  \n(iii) 15.5% if the Project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 12 1% if (i), (ii), \nand (iii) all happen. Table A12.4 summarizes the EIRRs for all Jilin subprojects. \n \n17.  The risk analysis was carried out to confirm the viability of the Project. The risk analysis \nwas carried out using the Monte Carlo simulation technique under a 1,000 simulation basis. The \ninputs for the risk analysis are taken from the base case benefit analysis/cost. The correlation \nbetween risk variables is explicitly considered before the simulation to avoid generation of \nunrealistic project scenarios. The risk analysis for EIRR selected five variables, viz., capital cost, \noutput, input prices, implementation delay, and exchange rate fluctuations. The expected EIRR, \nbased  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  is  17.8%  (with  a  standard \ndeviation of 2.7%), about 2.9% lower than the base case value without consideration of project \nrisks. The probability for the EIRR to be below the considered discount rate of 12% is 1.8%.  \nThe  very  low  economic  risk  is  intuitively  expected  because  the  project  generates  sound \nenvironmental benefits. \n \n \n \n   ", "Appendix 12        69 \nTable A12.4: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (Jilin Subprojects) \nSubprojects  EIRR (%) \nWWTP   \nDehui City WWTP  19.1 \nFusong County WWTP  19.8 \nFuyu County WWTP  18.3 \nGongzhuling City Fanjiatun Town WWTP  17.9 \nGongzhuling City Sewage Network Upgrade  18.0 \nJingyu County WWTP  18.2 \nLiuhe County WWTP  18.7 \nTonghua County WWTP  18.8 \nYushu City WWTP  19.5 \nSWM   \nDa\u2019an City SWM  16.4 \nFusong County SWM  19.9 \nHuadian City SWM  18.0 \nHuinan County SWM  19.1 \nJiaohe City SWM  19.3 \nJingyu County SMW  17.2 \nLiuhe County SWM  19.2 \nMeihekou City SWM  19.0 \nTongyu County SWM  19.3 \nYushu City SWM  18.6 \nRiver Improvement   \nChangbaishan Mountain Administrative Committee  20.0 \nJilin Component  18.4 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SWM = solid waste management, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nH.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact \n \n18.  The distribution analysis is based on the proportion of poor households in each county. \nThe distribution analysis for the Jilin component is illustrated in Table A12.5. The differences \nbetween the net economic benefits (NEB) and the net financial benefits (NFB) give rise to \nlosses and gains among the project participants. Considering the overall result of an NFB of \nnegative CNY275.1 million and an NEB of CNY4120.6 million for the Project, the NEB exceeds \nthe  NFB  by  CNY3845.5  million.  At  a  discount  rate  of  12%,  the  economy  will  gain  \nCNY1504.9 million, mainly from operating costs. The share of the NEB of the Project accruing \nto the poor is 14.18%. Since the ratio is higher than the poverty ratio (estimated at 7.4% in the \nproject area), the analysis concludes that the Project is pro-poor. The 14.18% share of NEB \ndoes not include indirect the benefits of the Project.  \n \n ", "70  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.5: Distribution of Project Benefits and Poverty Impact (Jilin Component) \n  Accounts  Beneficiaries \n  Financial  Economic  Difference    Government     \nItem  Accounts  Accounts  Consumers  Economy  Labor  Total \nBenefits  4,539.5     6,853.0     2,313.5  2,313.5        \nCosts                   \nCapital Costs  1,409.1     1,406.7              (2.4)                 2.4     \nOperating  2,412.3     1,195.5     (1,216.8)     1,216.8     \nCosts \nLabor      157.3           130.3            (27.1)      27.1    \nTaxes      285.7               0.0          (285.7)            285.7      \nTotal Costs  4,264.4     2,732.4     (1,532.0)         \nNet Benefits      275.1    4,120.6     3,845.5   2,313.5   1,504.9   27.1   3,845.5 \n  Poverty Impact             \n  Beneficiaries in Financial and Economic Accounts       \n            2,313.5   1,504.9      27.1   3,845.5  \n  Net Financial Benefits                275.1        275.1 \n  Total          2,315.5   1,780.0      27.1   4,120.6  \n  Proportion of Poor               12.0%            17.0%  15.0%  10.0% \n  Benefits to Poor             277.6           302.6   4.1    584.3  \nPoverty Impact Ratio                                14.18% \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.
