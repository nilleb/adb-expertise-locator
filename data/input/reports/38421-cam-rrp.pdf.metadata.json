The \nGovernment\u2019s  new  initiative,  a  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp)  to  trade, \naims to sustain economic growth by diversifying the country\u2019s currently \nnarrow  economic  base  of  garments,  tourism,  and  construction.  Private \nsector expansion is considered key to achieving these objectives.  \n\nits  poverty \n\nincidence \n\nrate \n\nCambodia\u2019s  poverty  rate  has  declined  in  the  past  two  decades  from \n69.0%  of  the  population  living  below  $2  a  day  in  1996  to  a  projected \n50.5%  in  2007.  And,  using  the  national  poverty  line  based  on  daily \ncalorie intake, the incidence of poverty has declined from 47% in 1994 \nto 35% in 2004\u2014a remarkable reduction considering this period\u2019s rapid \npopulation  growth.  The  decline  was  driven  by  economic  expansion, \nopening \nincreased  rice \ntrade  and \nproduction,  and  greater  urbanization.  In  fact,  it  is  common  to  see  a \nsharp reduction in poverty once a country passes a per capita income \nthreshold of $400, as Cambodia did in 2005. Achieving further poverty \nreduction  will  depend  on  sustaining  economic growth  rate  of  7.5%  per \nyear  over  the  medium  term  by  diversifying  the country\u2019s  economy  and \nmobilizing additional fiscal resources to support long-term development \nand social spending objectives.  \n\nthe  economy \n\ninvestment, \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nii \n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \n\nto \nthrough \n\nimprove  Cambodia\u2019s  climate \n\ntechnical  and  program  support \n\nThe  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  2005\u20132009  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  identifies  private  sector  development  as  a \nkey  priority  for  Cambodia.  It  emphasizes  that  ADB  will  help  the \nfor  private  sector \nGovernment \nfor  policy, \ndevelopment \ninstitutional,  and  regulatory  reform  in  key  sectors.  The  CSP  seeks  to \ntransform  the  agriculture  sector  from  subsistence  farming  to  a  more \ncommercial  orientation, \ntransport  and  power \nimprove  basic \ninfrastructure,  strengthen  the  regulatory  regime  governing  financial \ninstitutions, develop small and medium-sized enterprises, and promote \ngreater  regional  integration  through  ADB\u2019s  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nProgram.  Linked  to  private  sector  development  is  good  governance \nthrough  promoting  competition  policy,  which  suggests  that  the  reform \nagenda  should  be  broad-based  and  focused  on  reducing  transaction \ncosts  of  doing  business  and  improving  predictability  in  the  investment \nclimate. Reforms supporting and strengthening the investment climate, \ncompetition  policy,  and  better  access  to  technology;  completing  the \nunfinished \nfacilitation \nmeasures  and  macroeconomic  stability  in  support  of  private  sector \ngrowth are also important for reducing transaction costs and expanding \nand diversifying the private sector.  \n\ntrade  policy  regime;  and  enhancing \n\ntrade \n\nThe Government has implemented a series of reform measures for the \ninvestment  climate  and  trade  aimed  at  reducing  the  cost  of  doing \nbusiness  in  Cambodia,  including  customs  reforms  and  other  trade \nfacilitation measures. Business climate reforms undertaken in the last 2 \nyears\u2014many  accomplished  through  ADB\u2019s  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Development Program\u2014have also helped Cambodia to move \nup  15  places  in  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  2008  Doing \nBusiness rankings. The Government is also committed to completing its \nWorld  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  commitments,  which  influence  how \nCambodia  thinks  about  its  business  climate  and  trade  policy  over  the \nmedium  term.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  has  introduced  more \nprudent fiscal policies to address the surge in domestic inflation caused \nby supply-side developments in global oil and food markets.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  PED  Program  will  be  an  expanded  and  diversified \nprivate  sector.  The  outcome  of  the  PED  Program  will  be  an  improved \nbusiness environment where the private sector operates efficiently and \neffectively. \n \nThe PED Program includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the \npriorities  of  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010    and \nits trade development agenda (SWAp) and are designed to (i) maintain \nmacroeconomic stability necessary for private sector development and \ngrowth  by  continuing  to  make  progress  toward  price  stability  through \nprudent \ninvestment  climate  by \nimprove \nstrengthening  investor  protection,  enhancing  the  environment  for \ncompetition  and  innovation,  and  institutionalizing  a  regulatory  impact \nassessment  within  the  Government  and  other  policy  reforms  aimed  at \nreducing  transaction  costs  and  risks  in  Cambodia;  and  (iii)  improve \n\nfiscal  policy; \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\niii\n\ntrade  policy  and  facilitation  by  continuing  reforms  to  meet  WTO  legal \nrequirements,  renewing  trade  policy  reforms,  and  enhancing  trade \nfacilitation  by  strengthening  SPS  management  systems  and  customs \nreforms. \n \nA  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF) will be provided for subprogram 1 of the PED Program with terms \nof 24 years, an 8-year grace period, 1.0% interest rate during the grace \nperiod,  and  1.5%  during  amortization  and  other  terms  and  conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  A  capacity  development  project \nfinanced  by  a  $2  million  grant,  financed  under  ADB\u2019s  ADF,  will  be \nprovided  to  strengthen  SPS  management  systems  under  the  program \ncluster.  \n \nThe  PED  Program  implementation  period  is  from  June  2007  to \nDecember  2012.  The  subprogram  1  period  is  from  June  2007  to \nDecember  2008,  with  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $20  million  to  be \ndisbursed  under  subprogram  1  when  the  Government  has  met  the \nconditions  for  effectiveness.  Policy  measures  for  subprogram  2  are \nsubject  to  revision  and  refinement  following  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the \nmacroeconomic environment, changes in the external environment, and \nlessons  learned  from  implementing  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  2, \ncurrently  estimated  at  $15  million,  will  be  presented  for  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors\u2019  consideration  approximately  24  months  after \nthe \neffectiveness  of subprogram  1,  subject  to  the Government\u2019s  readiness \nto  continue  with  its  reform  agenda.  Subprogram  3,  also  currently \nestimated at $15 million, will be submitted for the Board\u2019s consideration \napproximately  24  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  subprogram  2 \n(about  October  2012),  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  readiness  to \ncontinue  with  its  reform  agenda.  The  starting  period  of  2007  was \nselected  as  it  reflects  the  period  of  ADB\u2019s  engagement  and  dialogue \nwith  the  Government  on  business  climate  reforms  embedded  in  the \nPED Program.  \n \nThe Government will use local currency counterpart funds generated by \nthe loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and associated costs \nof reform and to help maintain current levels of social expenditure. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating \nthe implementation of and sustaining the PED Program reform actions. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME)  and  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) are the implementing agencies. MOC will \nuse its Private Sector Development Sub-Steering Committee on Trade \nDevelopment  and  Trade-Related  Investments  (PSC),  chaired  by  the \nminister  of  commerce  and  comprising  senior  officials  from  MIME  and \nMEF  to  steer  the  program.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor \nprogress  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  PED  Program,  and \nthe  Executing  Agency  and \nprovide  guidance  and  direction \nimplementing agencies.  \n \n\nto \n\n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \niv \n \n\nProcurement  \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nThe PED Program will provide the following benefits: \n \n(i) \n\nimproving \n\nLowered transaction costs for businesses by reducing red tape, \nand  customs  reforms,  which  will  open  new  opportunities, \nincrease trade, investment and productivity, boost the economy, \nincrease  incomes,  and  create  jobs.

Employment  is  expected  to  rise  by \n4.3%  for  males  and  6.3%  for  females.  Poverty  is  expected  to  fall  by \n2.7%.  \n \nThe assumptions underlying the PED Program include the following.  \n \n(i) \n\nThe  economy  will  be  able  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability \nand withstand current external and domestic shocks.  \nThe  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  business  climate \npolicy reform measures and fiscal consolidation.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \nThe risks include the following. \n \n(i) \n\ntransitional \n\neconomies,  maintaining  macroeconomic \nIn \nstability\u2014as reflected, for example, in low inflation\u2014is crucial for \ninvestor confidence and private sector growth. Cambodia will be \nparticularly vulnerable to macroeconomic instability in 2008 and \n2009  due  to  the  recent  surge  in  inflation  ignited  by  supply  side \ndevelopments  in  the  global  commodity  and  food  markets,  the \nglobal  financial  crisis  that  may  slow  foreign  direct  investment \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\nto  assist \n\nface  emerging \n\nterm  Cambodia  will \n\nimplementing  programs \n\ninflows  to  Cambodia  and  the  expected  United  States  and \nEuropean  economic  recessions \nthat  will  hurt  Cambodian \nmerchandise  exports  to  these  markets.  In  addition,  over  the \nlonger \nfiscal  and \nmacroeconomic  challenges  in  the  context  of  its  anticipated \nresource  boom  and  associated  volatile  commodity  prices. \nRecognizing  these  risks,  the  Government  is  undertaking  fiscal \nand  monetary  policy  measures  to  maintain  macroeconomic \nthe  poor  and \nstability, \nvulnerable  from  these  shocks,  and  undertaking  measures  to \nstrengthen  public  expenditure  management  using  assistance \nfrom its development partners, including ADB. \nThere may be weak coordination among Government agencies \nleading  to  delayed  compliance  with  policy  measures  and \ncapacity  development,  but  the  adoption  of  the cluster  mode  for \npolicy  lending  has  reduced  this  risk.  By  basing  financial \nassistance  and  TA  on  completed  actions  derived  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  program,  the  PED  Program  strengthens \nthe  Government\u2019s  ownership  of \nthe  reform  program.  By \nincluding  policy  triggers  for  subsequent  subprograms,  the  PED \nProgram  offers  the  flexibility  needed  to  take  into  account \nchanges  in  the  external  environment  faced  by  Cambodia  and \nemerging priority policy reforms. Moreover, the Government has \ntaken  a  clear  stance  on  the  need  for  policy  adjustment  to \ndiversify  the  economy,  as  articulated  in  its  trade  development \nagenda. \nAgencies\u2019 capacity to implement reforms may be constrained by \nresources  and  other  emerging  priorities.  The  PED  Program \nreduces  this  risk  by  limiting  the  policy  triggers  to  a  few  high-\npriority, high-impact policy reforms under the jurisdiction of MOC \nand MIME and by attaching TA to each policy trigger.  \nVested  interests  will  resist  some  of  the  reforms.  Reforms  to \ninstitutionalization  of  economic  governance \ncustoms  and \nreforms  (e.g.,  regulatory  impact  assessment)  are  likely  to  be \nlengthy. However, several factors mitigate these risks. First, the \nPED  Program\u2019s  strategic  approach  is  to  focus  efforts  on \nsupporting the Government\u2019s initiatives and building on existing \ninstitutions. Second, reforms will focus on areas with political will \nand some measure of capacity. This has been demonstrated by \nMOC, which has championed trade reforms and lead the WTO \naccession process. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nCapacity \nDevelopment Grant \n\n \nThe  proposed  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Standards  Management \nSystems Project, to be financed under an ADF grant of $2 million, will \nfor  effective \nsupport  strengthening \nmanagement  systems,  regulatory  reform,  capacity  development,  and \npublic awareness. \n \nCore tasks under the proposed project include capacity development at \nthe  Institute  of  Standards  of  Cambodia  to  produce  WTO-compliant \ninternational  accreditation  as  a  conformity \nstandards,  obtain \n\ninstitutional \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nvi \n \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementing \narrangements \n\nTechnical \nAssistance  \n\n \n\nthe \n\nbody  with \n\nInternational  Organization \n\nfor \nassessment \nStandardization,  obtain  International  Organization  for  Standardization \naccreditation for SPS-related laboratories, support commercialization of \nthe Institute of Standards of Cambodia and selected laboratories, train \nstaff and assessors, and procure equipment. \n \nThe project is scheduled to commence in April 2009 and be completed \nby  March  2012,  with  an  expected  closing  date  of  September  2012.    A \nteam of international and national consultants will implement the project \ncomponents.  On  behalf  of  the  Government,  a  consulting  firm  will  be \nselected  and  administered  by  ADB  to  implement  the  project,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  An  estimated  total  of  58  person-months \n(48  international  and  10  national)  will  be  required  to  include  six \ninternational consultants and one national consultant. Equipment will be \nprocured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  objectives, \nscope, cost and financing, and project components and implementation \narrangements are in section V. \n \nMIME  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  project  implementation.  The \nExecuting  Agency  will  (i)  coordinate  project  implementation  with  the \nImplementing Agency, (ii) carry out administrative and fiduciary support, \nand  (iii) support  both  Government  and  ADB  reporting  requirements  on \nthe progress and use of the project funds. \n \nMOC  is  the  Implementing  Agency  for  SPS-related  activities  of  its \nstandards agency Camcontrol.  \n \nAn  $800,000  proposed  policy  and  advisory  TA  project,  funded  by  the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund, will support the PED Program.  \n \nThe  TA  grant,  Enhancing  Private  Sector  Competitiveness,  will  support \nthe  implementation  of  the  triggers  for  subprogram  2  and  provide  the \nGovernment  with  timely  policy  advice  on  a  demand  basis.  The  TA\u2019s \nobjective  is  to  assist  the  Government  in  finding  practical  solutions  to \naddress these issues, as well as to deepen the Government\u2019s agenda \nin  the  investment  and  trade  area  under  the  TA,  which  has  five \ncomponents.  Component  1  will  support  trade  policy  and  competition \npolicy  capacity  development  at  MOC,  including  assisting  in  capacity \ndevelopment  of  its  new  WTO  Notification  and  Legal  Compliance \nDepartment  that  will  develop  internal  procedures  for  notification, \nprepare  WTO\u2019s  trade  policy  review,  and  provide  trade  policy  analysis; \ndevelop  trade  remedies  guidelines  and  procedures;  and  facilitate  the \nestablishment  and  adoption  of  a  competition  policy  framework.  The \ncomponent  will  also  assist  MOC  roll  out  its  enterprise  registry  to \nselected  provinces.  Component  2  will  support  MOC  and  MIME  in \nimplementing  action  plans  for  regulatory  impact  assessment  and \nstrengthening  capacity  at  the  legislative  review  unit  at  the  Council  of \nMinisters.  Component  3  will  assist  MIME  in  developing  a  technology \npolicy  framework.  Component  4  will  support  MEF  in  developing  a \n\n\f \n\n \n\nvii\n\nframework for double taxation agreements and advocating its adoption \nas part of the Government\u2019s investment promotion regime. Component \n5  will  work  with  the  Customs  &  Excise  Department  to  complete \nimplementation  of  transaction  values,  strengthen  capacity  at  the  risk \nmanagement  unit,  and  undertake  a  study  on  Cambodia\u2019s  readiness  to \njoin the Kyoto Convention. \n \nMOC will be the Executing Agency for the project. The TA is scheduled \nto commence in April 2009 and be completed by October 2010. A team \nof  international  and  national  consultants  will  implement  the  project \ncomponents.  A  total  of  63  person-months  (26  international  and  37 \nnational) will be required, featuring six international consultants and four \nnational consultants.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nProgram  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  Program  (PED \nProgram)  for  $52.0  million  comprising  three  subprograms,  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  of  Special \nDrawing Rights 13,419,000 (equivalent to $20.0 million) for subprogram 1 of the Program, and \n(iii)  a  proposed  grant  of  $2  million  for  capacity  development  to  strengthen  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary  standards  (SPS)  management  systems.  This  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  improving  competitiveness  of  the  private  sector.  If  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan  and  grant,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nCambodia\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan \n\nframework, \n\nto  ensure  a  more \n\nintegrated  development  policy \n\nIn 2004, the Government announced its long-term development strategy\u2014known as the \n2. \nRectangular  Strategy\u2014that  focuses  on  better  governance  and  institutional  building,  including \nanticorruption  measures  and  public  administrative  reforms.  One  component  concentrates  on \npromoting  economic  growth  through  agriculture,  infrastructure,  and  private  sector  growth; \nemployment;  and  human  resource  development.  In  2006,  the  Government  announced  its \nsecond  5-year  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  (NSDP), 1  which  aims  to \noperationalize  the  Rectangular  Strategy  and  achieve  interim  targets  in  2010.  While  the \nRectangular  Strategy  focuses  more  on  the  identification  of  crosscutting  policy  issues  and \nthe  NSDP \nstrategies \noperationalizes it with programs, projects, and development targets (Figure 1).  \n \n3. \nTo  help  implement  the  priorities  and  programs  of  the  Rectangular  Strategy  and  the \nNSDP,  the  Government  has  adopted  several  sector  strategies,  most  with  time  bound \nimplementation  plans  and  clearly  defined  ministerial  responsibilities,  of  which  some  are \nsupported  by  ADB  sector  programs  and  TA.  The  anchor  for  the  Promoting  Economic \nDiversification  Program  is  the  Government\u2019s  trade  development  agenda  known  as  its  sector-\nwide approach (SWAp) to trade, underpinned by a diagnostic trade integration study (DTIS) that \nwas launched by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on 5 December 2007. The SWAp supports \nexpanding  the  private  sector  by  improving  both  foreign  and  domestic  trade  by  developing \nefficient backward links in the economy.2 It identifies 19 products as pilot projects for catalyzing \na  broad-based  reform  agenda,  while  at  the  same  time  recognizing  the  necessity  for  specific \nreforms and capacity-building initiatives in some sectors. The SWAp is a new initiative built on \nthree pillars: (i) crosscutting issues (SPS and trade policy formulation), (ii) capacity development \nin trade, and (iii) product development (i.e., the 19 products). The SWAp is coordinated by MOC \nthrough  the  Private  Sector  Development  Sub-Steering  Committee  on  Trade  Development  and \nTrade-related Investments (PSC) with the aim of mainstreaming trade in economic policy. The \nminister of commerce chairs the committee.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Kingdom of Cambodia. 2006. National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010.

It  provides  the opportunity  for  an  ongoing  dialogue\u2014involving  the  Government,  private \nsector, international development partners, civil society, and the academic community\u2014 on the \neconomic reform agenda and ways donors can assist with implementation. The PSC also allows \ndevelopment  partners  to  enhance  their  policy  engagement  with  the  Government  and  to  drive \nforward  the  NSDP  and  SWAp. 3  The  PED  Program  will  be  anchored  in  the  SWAp  and \ncoordinated by MOC through the PSC, which avoids the establishment of an additional forum. \nThe PED Program will focus on the following core policy areas identified in the SWAp and the \nDTIS: (i) SPS, trade policy capacity, and trade facilitation measures related to customs; and (ii) \ninvestment  climate  (regulatory  reform,  competition  policy,  and  innovation  policy).  The  PED \nProgram  will  also  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  given \nthe  need  for  economic  diversification,  the  external  environment\u2019s  recent  shocks,  and  their \nimpact on Cambodia (para. 15). \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  PED  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  private  sector  development  agenda, \nincluding  institutional  capacity  development,  as  highlighted  in  the  development  policy  letter \naddressed  to  the  President  of  ADB  (Appendix  2).  This  agenda  includes  (i)  macroeconomic \nstability  for  private  sector  development  and  growth;  (ii)  investment  climate,  competition  policy, \nand innovation policy; and (iii) trade policy and trade facilitation (Figure 2). The close alignment \nbetween  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  the  PED  Program  will  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to the reforms under the program.  \n \n6. \nKey features of the PED Program include (i) a series of single-tranche operations with a \nwell-defined, medium-term framework cluster specified at the outset, including completed high-\nimpact reforms before Board consideration; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms to ensure \ncontinual dialogue among the Government, ADB, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small number of \nwell-targeted policy actions designed to achieve high-impact outcomes in priority areas and to \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  with  attention  to  positive  outcomes  for  trade  facilitation  and \nefficient  private  sector  development  and  growth.  A  new  innovative  feature  of  the  cluster \napproach  is  linking  of  a  set  of  TA  projects  to  prior  policy  triggers  or  milestones  to  ensure \ngovernment  ownership  and  a  policy  environment  necessary \nfor  successful  project \nimplementation.  For  example,  the  matching  grants  project  for  SME  access  to  SPS  technology \nunder  subprogram  3  will  be  triggered  by  the  successful  endorsement  of  a  market-friendly \ntechnology and innovation policy under subprogram 2.  \n \n7. \n \n8. \nSubprogram 1 lays out the regulatory and strategic frameworks for priority private \nsector  areas.  One  example,  MOC\u2019s  new  Department  of  Notification  and  Legal  Compliance, \nalso known as the World Trade Organization (WTO) Department, will review new regulations for \nconsistency with Cambodia\u2019s WTO commitments. Subprogram 1 will also focus on maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  through  prudent  fiscal  policy  and  will  establish  the  basis  for  continual \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2009\u20132012 (subprograms 2 and 3).  \n\nThe PED Program has the following three phases. \n\n                                                 \n3   In addition, the Government and private sector have established the Government-Private Sector Forum facilitated \nby the International Finance Corporation, which meets twice a year and provides the private sector with a voice on \npolicy and regulatory issues. This forum has eight working groups. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nSubprogram  2  will  focus  on  institutional  capacity  development  for  delivering \n9. \npublic services to the private sector. Under this subprogram, government laboratories will be \nprepared  for  commercialization,  and  a  regulatory  impact  assessment  (RIA)  mechanism  will  be \nimplemented  on  an  experimental  basis  in  MIME  and  MOC  for  better  regulation-making. \nTechnical  assistance  will  also  be  provided  to  strengthen  capacity  of  the  legislative  review  unit \nhoused  the  Council  of  Ministers.  Further,  subprogram  2  will  address  key  risks  identified  in \nsubprogram 1, as well as make progress in other areas that emerge from policy dialogue. The \nexpected  time  frame  for  processing  subprogram  2  is  2  years  after  subprogram  1  becomes \neffective. Subprogram 2 contains 9 policy triggers to provide the flexibility needed to respond to \nunanticipated changes in the external environment by framing an appropriate policy response, \nwhich will ensure the PED Program is synchronized with the Government\u2019s policy agenda in an \nenvironment of rapidly changing policy priorities. \n \n10. \nSubprogram 3 will increase focus on capacity development of the private sector to \nimprove  competitiveness.  One  example  is  the  proposed  matching  grants  project  for  SME \naccess  to  SPS  technology.  The  expected  time  frame  for  processing  subprogram  3  is  2  years \nafter subprogram 2 becomes effective. Subprogram 3 contains 10 policy triggers that may also \nbe  reformulated  during  subprogram  2  to  reflect  progress,  new  priorities,  and  external \ndevelopments.  \n \nCountry Strategy and Program. Private sector development is a theme of the country \n11. \nstrategy and program for 2005\u201320094 and the country operations business plan for 2007\u20132009.5 \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  emphasizes  that  ADB  will  help  the  Government  to  improve \nthe climate for private sector development through policy, institutional, and regulatory reform in \nkey  sectors.  It  seeks  to  transform  the  agriculture  sector  from  subsistence  farming  to  a  more \ncommercial  orientation,  improve  basic  transport  and  power  infrastructure,  strengthen  the \nregulatory regime governing financial institutions, develop SMEs, and promote greater regional \nintegration through ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion Program. The PED Program is designed \nso that it complements ADB\u2019s other private sector development-related sector loans and grant \nprograms and projects, such as the Financial Sector Development Program 2 (FSDP 2) and the \nproposed  Public  Financial  Management  for  Rural  Development  (PFMRD)  Project,  to  increase \nsynergies for private sector benefits. The FSDP 2 aims to make the financial sector an efficient \nvehicle for mobilizing resources and broadening access to financing for the private sector and \naddresses  the  supply  side  of  access  to  finance  from  the  private  sector.  The  PED  Program \naddresses  the  demand  side  for  finance  through  improving  the  environment  for  private  sector \ngrowth  and  economic  diversification.  It  also  focuses  on  reforms  and  capacity  development  to \npromote  economic  diversification,  including  rural  development  through  investment  and  trade \nfacilitation  reforms.  The  PFMRD  will  roll  out  public  expenditure  reforms  in  rural  development \nministries  to  support  anticipated  increases  in  public  capital  spending  in  these  sectors  and \neconomic diversification. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2007.

ADB\u2019s engagement with the Government on private sector development issues \nbegan  with  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  Program  (SMEDP)  in  2004, \nand subsequent advisory TA projects and ADB missions. Under the SMEDP, the Government \ncreated  an  SME  development  strategy  that  coordinated  partners  on  SME  issues,  reformed \nregistration  procedures,  and  modernized  the  SME  registry,  resulting  in  a  six-fold  increase  in \nannual  registrations  in  Phnom  Penh  in  2006  (Appendix  4).  It  also  improved  SMEs\u2019  access  to \nfinance,  such  as  by  establishing  the  credit  information  bureau.  These  reforms  directly \ncontributed  to  Cambodia\u2019s  improved  performance  in  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s \n2008  Doing  Business  report,  increasing  its  global  ranking  by  15  places.  Moreover,  ADB \nprovides input on private sector development policy discussions through the PSD-SC and is the \nled donor for coordinating SPS, a major activity of the trade facilitation subcommittee. ADB has \nbeen  actively  engaged  with  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  member  states  on  promoting  trade \nfacilitation  covering  SPS,  customs,  logistics,  and  business  mobility  at  the  regional  level.  In \naddition, ADB has been actively engaged in dialogue with the Government on macroeconomic \npolicy issues, e.g., under the FSDP 2, an ongoing dialogue with the National Bank of Cambodia \nis  focusing  on  monetary  and  banking  policy.  Under  the  PED  Program,  a  fiscal  policy  dialogue \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  intensified  in  the  third  quarter  of  2006  when \npreparations for the program began.  \n \nOther  Development  Partners  and  Stakeholders.  The  PED  Program  will  coordinate \n14. \nclosely  with  other  development  partners  such  as  the  European  Commission,  International \nFinance  Corporation,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment  Organization,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  World  Bank, \nWorld  Trade  Organization,  and  other  stakeholders  providing  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment in Cambodia (Appendix 3). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nReview of the Economy, Investment Climate, and Poverty \n\nA. \n \n15. \nSustained Economic Growth in 2007. After a decade of respectable growth averaging \n7.5%,  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  accelerated  more  than  10%  in  2004  and  sustained  double-digit \nexpansion  through  2007  (Table  1).  This  robust  growth  was  driven  by  industry  with  particularly \nstrong performances by construction and garment making. Services were also strong, especially \ntourism, banking, and real estate.  Agriculture, which tends to be volatile, averaged 6% growth \nduring  this  period.  However,  exports  soon  slowed  to  an  11%  growth  rate  in  2007,  down  from \n27% in 2006, primarily due to a sharp slowdown in garment exports. This slowdown continued \ninto 2008, with garment exports rising by 5%, the lowest rate of increase in several years. Two \nmillion  people  visited  Cambodia  in  2007\u2014a  record\u2014generating  an  estimated  $1.1  billion  in \nrevenue  and  helping  to  fuel  a  construction  boom  in  Siem  Reap  and  other  destinations.  Visitor \narrivals are estimated to exceed two million in 2008. Foreign investment almost doubled in 2007 \nover  2006  levels  ($900  million  versus  $475  million)  with  a  substantial  proportion  reportedly \ninvested  in  real  estate,  contributing  to  the  property  price  boom.  Several  major  international \ncorporations in agroprocessing and chemicals have set up representative offices in Cambodia, \nindicative of some investment diversification beginning to occur. \n \n16. \nInflation  Surged  at  the  End  of  2007. Cambodia has achieved rapid economic growth \nwith modest rates of inflation. Inflation averaged just below 4% per year between 2001 and early \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n2007,  anchored  by  the  United  States  (US)  dollar  and  low  US  inflation.6 However,  by  the  third \nquarter of 2007, domestic inflation began to surge, rising from 6.4% in September to 10.8% in \nDecember 2007 and to 25.7% by May 2008. Inflation pressure has begun to ease since June \nwith  inflation  in  July  at  22.3%  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Domestic  inflation  was  ignited  on  the \nsupply  side  by  sharply  higher  global  prices  for  petroleum  and  food  earlier  this  year,  and \nexacerbated by the depreciation of the US dollar against Cambodia\u2019s major trading partners in \n2007.  At  the  same  time,  there  had  been  signs  that  the  economy  was  overheating\u2014economic \ngrowth  in  2007  was  beginning  to  diverge  above  its  potential  growth  path;  private  sector  credit \nand broad money supply have expanded at unprecedented rates; and at the end of 2007, the \nbroad  monetary  aggregates  were  about  60%  higher  than  levels  1  year  before.  Furthermore, \nexcess  liquidity  in  the  banking  system  is  estimated  at  over  30%  of  deposits.  Unprecedented \nmonetary  aggregate  growth  rates  in  a  hugely  inflationary  environment  increased  risks  of \nsecond-round  inflationary  effects  and  macroeconomic  instability.  The  National  Bank  of \nCambodia  has  responded  by  doubling  the  reserve  requirement  from  8%  to  16%  and  relaxing \ncapital outflows by allowing, upon verification, commercial banks to invest their surplus reserves \nabroad where they can earn a higher rate of return. Growth in monetary aggregates slowed to \nabout 43% in the first semester of 2008 over the same period in 2007, indicating a lessening of \ninflationary pressures. \n \n17. \nPrudent  Fiscal  Policy.  The  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  is  limited  in  a  dollarized \neconomy like Cambodia, and must be supplemented with an appropriate fiscal policy stance\u2014\nfor example, accumulating domestic budget surpluses when strong inflation pressures emerge \nor  when  the  economy  shows  signs  of  overheating.  Accordingly,  Cambodia\u2019s  fiscal  policy  has \ntightened in recent years. The overall deficit narrowed significantly from over 7.0% of the gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  in  2002  to  2.8%  in  2007,  with  improvement  reflected  in  the  current \nbalance  surplus,  i.e.,  current  expenditures  less  current  revenues.  Total  revenues  have \nexpanded steadily in relation to the GDP, with gains from all major tax components. On the side \nof  expenditures,  a  period  of  consolidation  ended  in  2005;  the  following  2  years  witnessed  an \nincrease  in  spending  of  almost  1.5%  of  the  GDP  with  both  current  and  capital  expenditures \nrising. The approved 2008 budget is relatively expansionary on paper as it projects a fall in the \ncurrent budget surplus from 3% in 2007 to 1% in 2008 and a small drop in government deposits \nat the National Bank of Cambodia. However, during the first half of 2008, government deposits \nrose  over  30%  and  the  annualized  budget  deficit  fell  to  0.4%  of  the  GDP,  suggesting  that  the \nactual outturn may be less expansionary (para. 20).  \n \n18. \nChallenges to Sustaining Economic Growth in 2008 and 2009. Cambodia\u2019s economy \nin 2008 and 2009 will be vulnerable to three adverse developments in the external environment: \n(i) the financial global crisis may slow foreign direct investment inflows to Cambodia as investors \nwind back global investments due to the credit crunch in developed markets; (ii) the expected \ncontraction in the US and European economies in 2009 will affect the demand for Cambodian \nexports  and  visitors  to  Cambodia;  and  (iii)  the  unexpected  surge  in  international  food  and  oil \nprices  earlier  this  year,  contributed  to  higher  domestic  inflation  in  2008,  which  is  expected  to \nslow  household  consumption  and  economic  growth.  ADB  staff  forecasts  on  economic  growth \nsuggest that the increases in oil prices may cut the economic growth rate by as much as 3% in \n2008  due  to  Cambodia\u2019s  higher  fuel  content  in  production  costs.  Economic  growth  could  be \nlower  in  2009.  A  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  report  assessed  the  impact  of  global \ncommodity  prices  on  balance  of  payments  stability  by  simulating  the  effects  of  prices  on \n\n                                                 \n6   Cambodia is a highly dollarized economy with over 90% of deposits in the domestic banking system denominated \nin dollars. As a result, money and inflation conditions in Cambodia are influenced by money and inflation conditions \nin the US, as well as movements in the US dollar vis-\u00e0-vis Cambodia\u2019s trading partners. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nchanges in foreign reserve coverage in months of imports (the lower the reserve coverage, the \ngreater  risks  of  balance  of  payments  problems).7 For  Cambodia,  it  simulates  that  increases  in \nfood  prices  actually  add  to  reserves,  as  the  country  is  a  net  exporter  of  rice  and  other \ncommodities, while fuel price increases lower reserve coverage by between 0.5 and 1.0 month \nof  imports.  Overall,  reserve  coverage  falls  just  over  0.5  month  of  imports,  leaving  reserve \ncoverage  of  just  over  2.0  months  of  imports.  Conventionally,  at  least  3  months  of  import \ncoverage  is  considered  a  sufficient  buffer  against  shocks.  With  the  sharp  decline  in  oil  prices \nsince September 2008, inflationary pressures should ease over the next few months.  \n\n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in Cambodia \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n\n2004 \n\n Agriculture \n Industry \n Services \n\n \n393.7 \n10.0 \n-0.9 \n16.6 \n13.2 \n\n1.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nUsing the national poverty line based on a 2000 calorie intake per person, the incidence \n19. \nof  poverty  in  Cambodia  has  declined  from  47%  in  1994  to  35%  in  2004.  Using  the  $2-a-day \npoverty  line,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  estimated  to  have  fallen  from  69.0%  in  1996  to  a \nprojected 50.5% in 2007.8 This compares with 62.3% of the population living below $2 a day in \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 32.9% in Viet Nam, 45.2% in Indonesia, and 44.9% in \nthe  Philippines.  Factors  contributing  to  this  remarkable  reduction  in  poverty  include  sustained \nper  capita  income  expansion,  with  poverty  sharply  falling  after  per  capita  income  surpassed \n$400 in 2005; greater labor mobility between rural and urban areas (and urbanization); higher \nrice production; private sector expansion; and improvements in market access internally and to \nneighboring  countries.  Poverty  in  Cambodia  is  primarily  a  rural  phenomenon,  with  the  official \nrural  poverty  rate  at  39%  of  the  rural  population.  Moreover,  there  are  significant  regional \ndisparities  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  Cambodia,  with  very  low  rates  of  poverty  recorded in \nregions with higher per capita incomes (e.g., Phnom Penh, Kandal province, and Sihanoukville) \nand high rates in those with low per capita incomes (e.g., Kampong Speu, Kampong Thum, and \nSiem  Reap).  At  the  same  time,  income  inequality  has  increased,  as  measured  by  the  Gini \ncoefficient, from 0.35% in 1994 to 0.40% in 2004. The widening income gap between rural and \nurban  populations  and  within  rural  populations  contributed  to  this  increase.  Rising  income \ninequality  is  typical  in  the  earlier  stages  of  development  in  a  low-income  but  fast-growing \neconomy  driven  by  urban  economic  growth.  ADB  staff  poverty  simulations  indicate  that \nCambodia could reach its Millennium Development Goal  national poverty target of 24% of the \npopulation by 2015, depending on achieving an economic growth rate of 7.5% (or 5% per capita \nincome growth) per year from 2008 to 2015, low inflation in the range of 3% per year, and stable \nincome  distribution.  However,  these  variables  have  deteriorated  in  2008,  thus  increasing  the \nprobability that Cambodia may fall short of its target.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n20. \nThe  challenge  for  Cambodia  is  to  sustain  a  high  economic  growth  rate,  accelerate  the \ncreation  of  productive  jobs,  and  continue  poverty  reduction\u2014difficult  tasks  with  half  of  the \npopulation  under  age  20  years  and  more  than  85%  employed  in  the  informal  sector.  The \nGovernment recognizes that the key to sustaining high economic growth and poverty reduction \nis  to  diversify  the  sources  of  growth  from  its  currently  narrow  base  in  construction,  garment \nmaking, and tourism (Figure 3), which requires further reforms to improve competitiveness at all \nlevels of the supply chain (Appendix 4). Sustaining high economic growth over the longer term \nwill  require  export  diversification  as  well  as  building  links  between  agriculture  and  the  modern \nsector.  The  Government  believes  that  the  private  sector  will  be  central  to  its  diversification \nstrategy. Reforms to enhance competitiveness will require macroeconomic stability, institutional \nreforms to investment climate, competition policy, and enhanced trade facilitation measures. \n\n                                                 \n8   The  $2-a-day  poverty  line  is  estimated  using  a  basket  of  goods  adjusted  for  differences  in  cost  of  living  across \n\ncountries using 1993 prices. This allows for an international comparison of poverty rates.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 3: Distribution of Non-Agriculture GDP in 2002 and 2007 \n(%) \n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\nConstruction\n\nTourism\n\nGarments\n\nOther non-agricultural\n sectors \n\n                     GDP = gross domestic product. \n\n Source: National Income Accounts, National Statistics Office. \n\n2002\n\n2007\n\n \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Stability for Private Sector Growth \n\nA  critical  short-term  issue  affecting  private  sector  growth  is  inflation.  Over  the \n21. \nlonger term, a potential challenge for the Government will be to improve conditions for growth of \nthe nonresource private sector in the event that Cambodia\u2019s oil reserves are proven to be large \nand lead to a substantial resource boom. Integral to maintaining this growth is macroeconomic \nstability. \n \n22.  Macroeconomic  stability  is  being  tested  by  the  surge  in  domestic  inflation  that  was \ninitially ignited by global food and oil price surges, and most recently, the possibility of emerging \nsecond-round  effects.  Authorities  will  need  to  supplement  the  recent  tightening  of  monetary \npolicy  with  tighter  fiscal  policy  to  slow  aggregate  demand  and  inflation  pressures.  This  will \nrequire continuing to operate sizeable current budget surpluses and accumulating government \ndeposits  at  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  above  its  current  level  of  6%  of  GDP  for  2008 \n(Figure 4). \n \n23. \nA  Future  Oil  Boom  Could  Impact  Private  Sector  Development.  The  nonresource \nprivate sector will be influenced by future developments in the resource sector. While there are \nno definitive figures on Cambodia\u2019s proven oil reserves and timing of future production contracts \nand  commercial  operations,  the  Government  anticipates  significant  future  revenues  from  oil \nextraction  and  other  investments  in  the  mining  sector  in  the  form  of  taxes,  royalties,  and \ndividends.  Revenue  flows  would  provide  fiscal  space  and  a  tremendous  opportunity  for \nCambodia  to  finance  its  priority  development  goals,  raise  the  per  capita  income,  and  reduce \npoverty,  as  earlier  resource  booms  have  done  in  Indonesia  and  Botswana.  At  the  same,  a \nresource boom of long duration can affect competitiveness of the nonresource tradable goods \nsectors (agriculture and garments) if it leads to an excessive appreciation of the real exchange \nrate\u2013\u2013i.e., where the appreciation cannot be justified on the basis of economy-wide productivity \ngrowth  and  investment.  There  are  important  lessons  to  be  learned  from  Indonesia  and \nBotswana in maintaining private sector growth when there is an oil boom, including maintaining \nfiscal discipline, smoothing out expenditures to avoid excessively inflationary effects of resource \nrevenues  flows  in  the  economy,  and  reforming  the  business  climate  and  investments  to  raise \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nproductive capacity in the tradable goods sectors.9  \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Fiscal Performance \n(% of GDP)  \n \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n206\n\n2007\n\nRevenue\n\nExpenditure\n\nCurrent balance\n\nOverall balance\nGovernment deposits \n\n \n\nSources: Budget documents, Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n\n \n \n24. \nThe Government is acutely aware of the necessity for a stable macroeconomy for private \nsector development. In this context, the Government is operating a prudent fiscal policy, and it \nhas  tightened  monetary  policy  and  relaxed  restrictions  on  banks  holding  deposits  offshore  to \nreduce  excess  liquidity  in  the  domestic  banking  system.  However,  there  are  challenges  to \nimproving  fiscal  sustainability  over  the  medium  term.  Cambodia  has  one  of  the  lowest  tax \nrevenue  to  GDP  ratios  (about  10\u201311%)  among  low-income  countries,  partly  because  of  the \ndominance  of  the  subsistence  agriculture  sector  in  the  economy.  Revenue  management  is \nchallenged  by  (i)  the  dual  tax  system,  with  the  estimated  tax  system  undermining  revenue \nmobilization;  (ii)  nontransparent  fiscal  incentives  regime;  and  (iii)  weak  tax  administration. \nRecent  improvements  in  tax  collection  have  helped  address  part  of  the  problem  of  revenue \nmobilization, with revenues rising by 42% in 2007.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Climate \n\nInvestment Growth is concentrated in a few sectors. While investment in Cambodia \n25. \nhas  shown  robust  growth  in  the  last  4  years\u2014averaging  13%  per  year  since  2003\u2014and  the \ninvestment  to  GDP  rate  has  increased  from  19%  in  2003  to  21%  in  2007,  it  has  been \nconcentrated  in  a  few  sectors  such  as  real  estate,  tourism,  and  until  recently,  garments.  This \nreflects  the  concentrated  economic  base  of  the  modern  economy  where  these  three  sectors \nalone  account  for  42%  of  nonagriculture  GDP  (Figure  3).  While  there  has  been  some \ndiversification in the economy, much needs to be done to facilitate greater diversification and to \nachieve a higher investment rate.  \n \nInvestment Constraints. Several surveys and numerous value-chain studies10 highlight \n26. \na  common  set  of  policy  and  structural  constraints  facing  investors  in  Cambodia.  The  major \nconstraints to investment in 2007 and 2008 involve the high cost of electricity, macroeconomic \ninstability,  anticompetitive  practices  in  the  nontradable  goods  sector,  red  tape  and  regulatory \nuncertainty, inadequate skills of the labor force, limited access to technology and low innovative \nactivity,  and  costly  trade  facilitation.  Results  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2007  Investment  Climate \n                                                 \n9   International Monetary Fund. 2007. Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific. Washington, DC (Chapter 4). \n10  Value-chain  studies  attempt  to  identify  policy,  structural,  and  other  bottlenecks  at  each  stage  of  the  production \nprocess of a commodity, e.g., from farmer to the port. Studies of this type are a useful diagnostic tool for identifying \nboth crosscutting issues as well as sector-specific development issues. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nAssessment  show  that  corruption,  macroeconomic  instability,  anticompetitive  practices,  and \nregulatory uncertainty were the four major obstacles to business growth in 2007 (Figure 5). The \nsurvey  reported  that  about  30%  of  firms  said  regulatory  policy  uncertainty\u2014the  uneven \ninterpretation of laws and regulations\u2014and anticompetitive practices were severe constraints to \ntheir  business.  Investors  also  feel  there  has  been  improvement  in  other  constraints,  such  as \nlower  crime  as  well  as  progress  in  the  legal  system,  customs,  and  tax  administration.  A  2006 \nUnited States Agency for International Development survey found that as a consequence of too \nmuch  regulation,  inspections  by  government  officials  also  appear  to  be  excessive.  Most \ninspections came from the tax, fire and building safety, and labor departments, followed by the \npolice  and  local  authorities.  Surveys  have  estimated  that  informal  charges  may  amount  to \nanywhere between 3% and 7% of business turnover, equivalent to a profit tax of between 10% \nand 20%. In this context, the Government will need to implement measures in several areas to \nincrease  private  investment,  such  as  improving  the  investment  climate  (e.g.,  by  lowering \nregulatory  costs  and  improving  investor  protection),  promoting  competition  in  the  nontradable \ngoods sectors, improving access to innovation and technology, and improving trade facilitation. \n \n \n\nFigure 5: Establishments Identifying Problem as \u201cMajor\u201d Obstacle to Growth \n(% of firms) \n\n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n0\n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\np\nu\nr\nr\no\nC\n\n \ny\nt\ni\nl\ni\n\nb\na\nt\ns\n\ni\n\n \nc\nm\no\nn\no\nc\ne\no\nr\nc\na\nM\n\ni\n\n \ny\nr\no\nt\na\nu\ng\ne\nR\n\n \ny\nt\nn\na\nt\nr\ne\nc\nn\nu\n\nl\n\n \ns\ne\nc\ni\nt\nc\na\nr\np\n\n \ne\nv\ni\nt\ni\nt\ne\np\nm\no\nc\n-\ni\nt\nn\nA\n\n \ns\nt\ns\no\nc\n \ny\nt\ni\nc\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\nE\n\nl\n\n2007\n\n2003\n\n \ne\nm\n\ni\nr\n\nC\n\n \ne\nt\na\nu\nq\ne\nd\na\nn\nI\n\n \ns\n\nl\nl\ni\n\nk\ns\n\n \ne\np\na\nt\n \nd\ne\nR\n\n \ne\nc\nn\na\nn\ni\nf\n \nf\no\n \nt\ns\no\nC\n\n                Source: World Bank Investment Climate Survey, 2003 and 2007. \n \nInvestor  Certainty  and  Protection.  In  2003,  the  Government  enacted  a  new \n27. \ninvestment  law  that  provides  broad  investor  protection  and  guarantees,  a  useful  promotional \ntool.  However,  in  emerging  economies,  risks  are  greater,  so  investment  laws  are  often \nsupplemented  with  bilateral  investment  agreements  that  elaborate  investor  guarantees, \nprotection,  and  dispute  resolution.  Cambodia  joined  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Multilateral  Investment \nGuarantee  Agency  in  2000.  It  has  some  20  bilateral  investment  agreements  with  trading \npartners  and  is  negotiating  additional  agreements  with  Algeria,  Austria,  Egypt,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  Libya,  Myanmar,  Russian  Federation,  Ukraine,  and  United  Kingdom.11 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11 Cambodia  has  bilateral  agreements  on  the  promotion  and  protection  of  investments  with  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, \nthe  Netherlands,  Democratic  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Korea,  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries, \nPakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, US (Overseas Private Investment Corporation), and Viet \nNam.  They  provide  reciprocal  national  treatment  to  investors,  excluding  benefits  deriving  from  membership  in \nfuture customs unions or free trade areas and agreements relating to taxation, and preclude expropriations except \nthose  undertaken  for  a  lawful  or  public  purpose,  when  nondiscriminatory,  prompt,  adequate,  and  effective \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nCambodia  established  the  Trade  and  Investment  Framework  Agreement  with  the  US  in  2006 \nthat provides a forum for bilateral dialogue on investment and trade issues, of which Cambodia \nis  hopeful  of  negotiating  a  bilateral  investment  treaty  in  2009.  In  July  2008,  Cambodia  also \nentered  a  bilateral  investment  agreement  with  Japan.  Foreign  investors  are  likely  to  avoid \ndestinations  where  they  may  be  subject  to  double  taxation  in  the  home  and  host  countries, \nunless generous tax breaks are provided in the host country. Countries overcome this problem \nthrough  negotiating  double  taxation  agreements,  but  Cambodia  has  none.  Expanding  the \nnetwork  of  bilateral  investment  agreements  and  negotiating  double  taxation  agreements  will \nhelp  improve  investor  confidence  and  contribute  to  investment  and  economic  diversification. It \nwould be an opportune time to review the effectiveness and budgetary cost in terms of foregone \nrevenues of fiscal investment incentives, indeed, double taxation agreements seem a necessary \nprecursor to reforming such incentives. \n \n28. \nCompetition  Policy.  In  general,  Cambodia  is  a  competitive  economy  where  many \nanticompetitive  issues  that  characterize  most  other  Southeast  Asian  economies  are  less \nrelevant. For example, Cambodia is relatively open at the border. Most major nontariff barriers \nhave  been  eliminated  and  tariffs  reformed,  albeit  they  are  still  relatively  high  in  some  areas. \nCambodia  also  does  not  have  a  large  state  enterprise  sector,  normally  a  major  source  of \nanticompetitive  behavior  in  developing  economies.  However,  as  the  economy  expands  and \nbecomes  more  sophisticated,  it  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  competition  in  industries  typically \nvulnerable to anticompetitive behavior, mainly traditional nontradable services, such as utilities. \nA  pragmatic  approach  to  competition  policy  would  be  to  establish  a  policy  framework  for \ncompetition  focusing  on  open  tariff  and  other  trade  policies,  as  well  as  deregulatory  rules  and \nguidelines overseen by independent regulatory bodies to ensure contestable utility markets, and \nestablishing  a  RIA  within  the  Government  to  ensure  regulations  are  not  anticompetitive  and \nlicensing  does  not  disadvantage  existing  or  potential  competitors  (i.e.,  competitive  neutral \nregulations). Regional neighbors have implemented competition policies; Indonesia\u2019s approach \nhas been to start with trade reforms, deregulation, and then privatization. At the later stages of \nimplementation, the Government of Indonesia introduced a competition law and commission in \n1999.  The  commission\u2019s  approach  has  been  pragmatic,  and  its  efforts  have  helped  trigger \nderegulation  in  a  few  sectors  (e.g.,  domestic  airlines).  However,  its  capacity  to  carry \nsophisticated economic analysis required for demonstrating anticompetitive behavior has been \nlimited.  \n \n29. \nExcessive Red Tape and Licensing. In Cambodia, investors are concerned about red \ntape  and  associated  informal  payments.  Line ministries  are  not  required  to  assess  the  cost  of \ncompliance with regulations for the business community or individuals or to assess whether the \nregulations  may  hurt  competition.  Therefore,  regulatory  compliance  costs  imposed  on  the \nprivate sector are not appreciated. However, unlike many other developing countries, Cambodia \ndoes have a legislative review process carried out by the Economic, Social Affairs and Culture \nObservation Unit (OBSESS) housed at the Council of Ministers. OBSESS does not advocate a  \ngovernment-wide RIA; however, strengthening its capacity to advocate and oversee RIA would \nimprove the quality of regulation. In addition, under the SMEDP, TA was provided to MIME staff \nto carry out a review of licenses, and toolkits were developed. Lessons from this activity indicate \nthat  the  review  must  be  institutionalized  within  line  ministries,  and  an  oversight  agency  is \nneeded  to  advocate  and  monitor  RIA.

In the \nlate  1980s,  however,  a  process  of  market-oriented  reforms  began.  The  state  monopoly  on \nforeign  trade  was  abolished  in  1987,  and  a  1989  foreign  investment  law  allowed  private \ncompanies to engage in foreign trade. In 1993, trade policies were greatly liberalized resulting in \nfew binding quantitative restrictions and nonprohibitive tax rates on imports and exports. In 2001, \nthe \nthe  maximum  \nmost-favored  nation  rate  was  reduced  to  35%.  In  2004,  Cambodia  acceded  to  WTO  and \ncommitted to implementing legal reforms, including enacting over 25 different laws. However, no \nsignificant most-favored nation tariff reforms have occurred since 2001, although Cambodia has \ncontinued  to  implement  preferential  tariff  reductions  for  its  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  trading  partners  under  the  common  external  preferential  tariff.  Its  trade \nreforms  have  focused  on  trade  facilitation  measures,  and  preferential  tariff  reductions  have \nwidened  the  tax  wedge  with  most-favored  nation  rates.  Going  forward,  it  is  opportune  time  to \nreassess the tariff structure with a view to toward reducing the maximum rate of 35% to lower \nthe  tax  wedge.  The  timing  of  tariff  reductions  will  be  subject  to  tax  revenue  sustainability \nassessments,  as  customs  revenue  collection  accounts  for  about  25%  of  the  Government\u2019s \nbudget revenues.  \n\nliberalized  when \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nFigure 7: Import Tariff Rates \u2013 Regional Comparison \n(% rate) \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\no\n\nb\n\nm\n\na\n\nC\n\ndia\n\ne sia\n\nn\n\no\n\nd\n\nIn\n\nR\n\nD\n\no  P\n\na\n\nL\n\nala y sia\n\nM\n\ne s\n\npin\n\nhilip\n\nP\n\nm\n\na\n\nV iet  N\n\nd\n\nn\n\naila\n\nh\n\nT\n\n     \n      Sources: Customs departments of Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, and Viet Nam.

The  Government  continues  to  implement  economic,  trade,  and \nlegal  commitments  as  agreed  under  its  WTO  accession.  However,  it  has  not  yet  completed \nimplementation of its customs transaction valuation commitments, which are due by 2009. Legal \nand compliance notifications to WTO are also backlogged, including technical barriers to trade, \nSPS,  and  other  potential  nontariff  barriers.  Therefore,  MOC  established  the  Department  of \nNotification  and  Legal  Compliance  (WTO  Department)  as  the  Government\u2019s  focal  point  for \ncomplying  with  WTO  notification  requirements.12 While  the  Government  considers  completing \nWTO  commitments  important  for  its  integration  efforts,  it  must  strengthen  the  capacity  to \nimplement  required  policy  reforms  and  to  establish  compliance  notification  procedures  across \nrelevant  agencies.  This  requires  significant  capacity  development  within  the  WTO  Department \nas  well  as  staff  training.  An  immediate  task  will  be  to  prioritize  future  work  priorities  of  the \nvarious offices, including assigning each office clear responsibilities, especially in light of current \ninadequate staff numbers, which are unlikely to be substantially raised. The WTO Department \ncurrently  is  \u201ctop  heavy\u201d  with  nine  staff  members,  including  the  director  and  three  deputy \ndirectors; the position of deputy director of the Legal Compliance Office is currently vacant. The \nWTO  Office  has  two  staff  members  and  the  Notification  and  Administration  Office  one  staff \nmember; the other two offices, including the increasingly important Services Negotiation Office, \neffectively  have  no  staff  members.  This  may  also  be  an  opportune  time  for  Cambodia  to \nundertake its first WTO trade policy review, an obligation that would provide a desirable stock \ntake on its trade-related policy regime; increase transparency; and inform WTO partners of its \ntrade-related developments, any major policy obstacles, and TA needs. \n \n32. \nStrengthening  Trade  Policy  Capacity.  The  institutional  arrangements  and  processes \nfor  establishing  trade  policy  are  just  as  important  as  reforms  to  the  trade  policy  regime.  In \nCambodia,  MEF  sets  tariff  rates  since  they  are  a  major  source  of  the  Government\u2019s  budget \nrevenue. MOC establishes the broad trade policy framework and agenda, is the Government\u2019s \nlead agency in WTO negotiations, and inspects imports through Camcontrol. While MOC has a \nforeign  trade  directorate,  of  which  the  new  WTO  Department  is  part,  it  lacks  the  resources \nneeded to conduct adequate trade policy analysis essential for supporting further trade reforms \nand  to  participate  in  WTO.13 At  the  same  time,  several  government  agencies  are  involved  in \n                                                 \n12 The  department  consists  of  four  offices,  each  headed  by  a  deputy  director.  These  are  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  Office,  the  Notification  and  Administrative  Office,  the  Legal  Compliance  Office,  and  the  Services \nNegotiation Office. \n\n13 The collapse of the Doha multilateral negotiations and other difficulties confronting WTO have heightened the need \nto build Cambodia\u2019s capacity to evaluate unilateral nondiscriminatory trade-related reforms. These offer the largest \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nsetting  trade  policy,  such  as  MEF,  MAFF,  Ministry  of  Health,  and  Ministry  of  Environment,  so \nensuring  consistency  of  trade  policy  across  the  Government  is  a  challenge.  With  increasing \nprivate  sector  demand  (e.g.,  cement  industry)  for  trade  remedies,  MOC  intends  to  establish \nantidumping  and  safeguard  mechanisms.  It  will  be  important  that  these  arrangements  are \nadministered  using  an  economy-wide  approach  and  measures  adopted  to  ensure  it  does  not \nbecome anticompetitive and a conduit for nontransparent forms of protection. \n \n33. \nCustoms  Reforms.  Several  surveys  suggest  that  Cambodia\u2019s  customs  operations, \nincluding document preparation, port and terminal handling, and inland transport and handling, \nare  still  an  obstacle  to  efficient  trade.  Cambodia  ranks  104  of  150  countries  on  customs \nefficiency according to a World Bank 2007 survey on trade logistics, well behind Malaysia (23), \nThailand  (32),  Indonesia  (44),  and  Philippines  (53).  The  time  taken  to  export  was  37  days  in \n2007,  down  from  43  days  in  2005.  In  recent  years,  Cambodia  has  implemented  important \nreforms,  including  a  new  customs  law  in  2007  that  requires  40  supporting  or  implementing \nregulations.  In  2008,  the  Government  operationalized  a  single  administrative  document  to \nstreamline customs documentation and piloted ASYCUDA14 at the seaport of Sihanoukville\u2014a \ncustoms  information  management  system  that  promotes  arms-length  transactions  between \nimporters  and  customs  officials  as  well  as  timely  trade  and  customs  data  collection.  A  risk \nmanagement  unit  has  been  established  at  the  Customs  &  Excise  Department,  which  once \nproperly operationalized, will help lower inspection rates at the ports. Going forward, ASYCUDA \nwill also need to be rolled out to other major (dry) ports and an action plan must be created to \ncomplete  implementation  of  Cambodia\u2019s  customs  transaction  valuation  commitments  under \nWTO.  Cambodia  is  not  yet  a  member  of  the  Kyoto  Convention,  which  promotes  transparency \nand efficiency in customs procedures and operations. \n \n \n\nFigure 8: Time to Trade Across Borders and its Components \n\ndays \n\n80 \n70 \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n\n0\n\nPorts and\nterminal\nHandling\n\nCustoms\nclearance and\ntechnical\ncontrol\nIn land\ntransportation\nand Handling\n\nDocument\nPreparation \n\n \n\nCambodia \n\nLao PDR\n\nViet Nam\n\nThailand\n\nPRC\n\n                     Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n                     Source: World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2006.

Improving SPS \nmanagement systems and administration is crucial to lowering the high incidence of food- and \nwater-related  diseases  and  creating  confidence  in  the  tourist-related  food  sector.  In  2006, \ntourists spent more than $90 million on food and beverages in hotels. Most importantly, however, \nit is critical to public health. In 2006, 672,000 individuals were admitted to the hospital for food- \nand water-related diseases (as compared to 17,883 in the US), with salmonella most common \nfollowed by campylobacter. \n \n36.  With  Cambodia\u2019s  accession  to  WTO,  it  agreed  to  full  SPS  compliance  within  a \ntransitional 5-year period. However, Cambodia is unlikely to achieve this commitment on time; \nalthough substantial SPS-related legislation and regulations have been produced in the last few \nyears, it has occurred ad hoc with little appreciation of the costs to the private sector as well as \nenforcement. Agencies also have duplicative functions and inspections along the supply chain \nfor  agro-based  processed  products  (Figure  A4.4).  The  laboratories  have  limited  capacity  to \nprovide  a  wide  range  of  SPS-related  testing  services.  The  Industrial  Laboratory  Center  of \nCambodia  under  MIME  (MIME  lab)  recently  renovated  its  premises  and  procured  modern \ntesting  equipment  funded  by  UNIDO.  However,  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  upgrade  its \nequipment, testing procedures and staff training. It has a limited budget to procure materials for \nundertaking  tests.  It  also  needs  to  operate  on  commercial  principles  to  ensure  its  financial \nviability.  Its  tests  results  are  not  internationally  recognized  and  therefore  it  needs  to  prepare \nitself for International Standards Organization (ISO) accreditation. The Institute of Standards of \nCambodia  (ISC)  needs  to  prepare  for  international  accreditation  as  a  conformity  assessment \nbody  so  it  can  certify  management  and  process  standards  that  would  be  internationally \nrecognized.  This  will  require  assistance  to  the  institute  to  prepare  for  accreditation,  training  of \nstaff  in  standards  and  its  assessors.  The  Government  recognizes  that  further  reforms  are \nrequired in several key areas, including: (i) strengthening the framework for SPS management \nsystems,  including  clarifying  roles  and  functions  among  the  different  agencies  involved, \nassisting  agencies\u2019  readiness  for  operating  on  a  commercial  basis,  and assisting  the  ISC  with \ndevelopment  of  its  conformity  assessment  body  and  its  ISO  accreditation;  (ii)  improving  SPS \nrelated  to  food  and  water;  and  (iii)  developing  effective  management  systems  such  as  further \nupgrading of laboratories (at MAFF, MIME, and Camcontrol), assisting with these laboratories\u2019 \nISO accreditation, and procuring equipment. \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\nADB  has  supported  reforms  in  several  areas  related  to  private  sector  development, \n37. \nincluding SME development, banking and financial sector reforms, and agriculture. Key lessons \nfrom ADB private sector development programs and the associated TA projects include: \n \n\n(i) \n\nLong-term perspective and government ownership. Promoting private sector \ndevelopment  and  economic  diversification  is  a  long-term  effort  requiring  a  \nlonger-term  policy  perspective.  The  adoption  of  the  SWAp  to  trade  and  DTIS \nmeant  that  the  Government  has  a  set  of  long-term  objectives  that  guide  and \nshape  medium-term  policy  design  and  implementation.  The  close  consultative \nprocess  involving  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners \nstrengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and  increased  the  potential  for \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nagency buy-in. \nFlexibility in design. Private sector reforms involving the investment climate and \ntrade  policy  and  facilitation  are  complex.  Consequently,  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated  for  program  implementation.  Lessons  from  the  SMEDP  suggest  that \nregulatory  reform  is  likely  to  be  successful  if  an  institutional  arrangement  is  in \nplace that provides for RIA. Design flexibility is also a key consideration. The use \nof  the  program  cluster  approach  provides  the  opportunity  to  refine  succeeding \nsubprograms  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements,  changes  in  the  policy \nenvironment, and lessons from the previous subprograms.  \nTA  resources.  Under  the  PED  Program,  institutional  development  will  be \nemphasized  to  improve  private  sector  competitiveness.  These  measures  and \nprojects  are  relatively  new  concepts  and  therefore  will  require  extensive \nto  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019  understanding, \ncoordination  and  consultation \nacceptance, and likely adoption of new measures. Substantial TA support will be \nnecessary to ensure that best practices are incorporated and then consolidated \nthroughout implementation to achieve the intended results.  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n38. \nThe impact of the PED Program will be an expanded and diversified private sector. The \noutcome  of  the  PED  Program  will  be  an  improved  business  environment  where  the  private \nsector operates efficiently and effectively. \n\nThe PED Program includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the priorities of the \n\n \n39. \nNSDP and the SWAp and are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nmaintain macroeconomic stability necessary for private sector development and \ngrowth  by  continuing  to  make  progress  toward  price  stability  through  prudent \nfiscal  policy,  as  price  instability  in  a  transitional  economic  can  inhibit  private \nsector growth; \nimprove  the  investment  climate  by  strengthening  investor  protection,  enhancing \nthe environment for competition and innovation, and institutionalizing a RIA within \nthe  Government  and  other  policy  reforms  aimed  at  reducing  transaction  costs \nand risks in Cambodia; and \nimprove  trade  policy  and  facilitation  by  continuing  reforms  to  meet  WTO  legal \nrequirements, renewing trade policy reforms, and enhancing trade facilitation by \nstrengthening SPS management systems and customs reforms. \n\n \nSubprogram  1  is  designed  to  be  a  single-tranche  operation  with  a  well-defined \n40. \nframework to align with the Government\u2019s SWAp to trade. A TA project and a policy advisory TA \nalso  are  proposed  to  support  the  deepening  and  implementation  of  reforms  over  the  PED \nProgram  period.  Consideration  of  subprograms  2  and  3  and  will  depend  on  satisfactory \naccomplishment of policy triggers. TA for subprograms 2 and 3 will also depend on satisfactory \naccomplishment of TA triggers. The design and monitoring framework for the PED Program is in \nAppendix  1.  The  PED  medium-term  program,  including  the  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  1, \ntriggers,  and  milestones  for  subprograms  2  and  3,  is  in  Appendix  2.  Appendix  3  presents  the \ndonor  coordination  matrix.  Appendix  8  presents  the  TA  project,  and  Appendix  9  outlines  the \npolicy advisory TA. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n41. \n2008. \n \n\nAll 21 policy measures required for subprogram 1 were carried out by the end of October \n\n1. \n\nSubprogram 1, Core Area 1: Macroeconomic Stability in Support of Private \nSector Development \n\nSubprogram  1  acknowledges  that  Cambodia  has  made  progress  in  maintaining \n42. \nmacroeconomic stability through tightening its fiscal policy and implementing measures to lower \naggregate demand to contain inflation in 2008. \n\n \nThe increase in the public budget surplus from 1.2% of the GDP in 2006 to 3.2% in 2007 \n43. \nand  maintaining  a  sizeable  surplus  in  2008  were  major  achievements  and  contributed  to  an \nappropriate  macroeconomic  policy  response  to  the  surge  in  domestic  inflation  and  signs  of \noverheating of the economy in 2007. The appropriate fiscal stance is reflected in the continued \naccumulation of government deposits at the National Bank of Cambodia by over 30% in the 9 \nmonths of 2008 over 2007 levels. The increase in the budget surplus was aided by an increase \nin revenue collection, amounting to 42% in 2007 over 2006 levels, which was achieved through \ngreater income tax as well as improved tax collections. The continual reduction in the year-end \ndebt  level  from  27%  in  2005  to  25%  in  2006  and  24%  in  2007  further  improves  debt \nsustainability.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubprogram 1, Core Area 2: Investment Climate \n\nto \n\nimprove \n\nSubprogram  1  supports \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  agenda \n\n44. \nthe  regulatory \nenvironment  for  investments  and  private  sector  growth.  The  main  objective  is  to  diversify \ninvestment  in  the  economy.  Reform  areas  of  critical  significance  include  implementing  action \nplans  for  regulatory  impact  assessments,  reducing  the  cost  of  enterprise  registration,  and \nimproving investor protection. The following measures toward achieving these objectives were \ncompleted before Board consideration of subprogram 1. \n \nRegulatory  Review  Program.  The PED Program supports the Government\u2019s efforts to \n45. \nstreamline red tape by assisting with the establishment of an institutionalized RIA in the medium \nterm.  As  a  first  step  in  this  process,  MIME  has  developed  and  endorsed  an  action  plan  for \nestablishing an RIA. The RIA requires all proponents of new regulations within the ministries to \ncomplete a checklist on compliance cost and impact on competition. TA will be provided under \nthe  PED  Program  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan,  including  developing  the \nchecklists and training on cost compliance analysis. TA will be provided to MOC to develop an \naction plan and to assist OBSESS in strengthening its capacity in subsequent subprograms. \n \n46. \nReduce  Registration  Costs.  In 2007, MOC reduced the cost of enterprise registration \nto  $105  from  $177,  which  will  save  the  private  sector  several  millions  of  dollars  in  registration \ncosts over the next several years.  \n \n47. \nBilateral  Investment  Frameworks  and  Agreement.  Cambodia  is  a  party  to  several \nbilateral  investment  agreements.  The  Government  signed  a  bilateral  trade  and  investment \nframework  agreement  with  the  US  in  2006  to  establish  a  forum  for  bilateral  dialogue  on \ninvestment  and  trade  issues,  of  which  the  first  forum  was  undertaken  in  2007.  An  investment \nagreement  with  Japan,  effective  from  July  2008,  provides  for  investor  guarantees  covering \ndispute resolution, nationalization of assets, and repatriation of profits.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSubprogram 1, Core Area 3: Trade Policy and Facilitation \n\n48. \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  Government\u2019s  goals  of  continuing  trade  policy  reforms  to \nlower the cost of doing business for the private sector and measures to improve trade facilitation \n(customs  and  SPS)  for  enhanced  competitiveness.  Institutional  reforms  to  accelerate  WTO \ncommitments, customs reforms, and measures to improve SPS management systems were the \nmain  actions  toward  achieving  these  objectives  completed  before  Board  consideration  of \nsubprogram 1. \n \n49. \nAccelerating  WTO  Commitments.  Since  accession,  the  Government  continues  to \nimplement WTO commitments and to start notification of legal compliance with WTO obligations \nrelated  to  tariff  barriers  to  trade  and  SPS.  In  this  context,  MOC  in  2007  established  the  WTO \nDepartment,  which  has  been  provided  a  recurrent  budget  for  2008,  and  is  mandated  to \nimplement  notification  procedures  within  the  Government  and  assess  whether  proposed \nregulations  comply  with  WTO  rules.  The  department  will  also  be  the  focal  point  for  WTO \nnegotiations,  including  on  services  and  future  trade  policy  reviews.  It  will  require  longer-term \nassistance  to  build  capacity  to  execute  its  functions  and  produce  trade  policy  analyses \nnecessary for effective WTO participation. The WTO Department has produced a medium-term \ncapacity development and work plan for 2008\u20132010, which has formed the basis of the TA. An \nimmediate task of this TA will be to assist the department in prioritizing the remaining WTO and \ntrade  policy  reform  agenda,  including  addressing  implementation  issues  and  the  backlog  in \nnotifications of legal compliance and priority trade laws.  \n \n50. \nCustoms  Reforms.  The  Government  has  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing \ncustoms reforms in 2008, critical to improving trade facilitation at the border. Under subprogram \n1,  four  measures  were  taken  to  improve  customs  facilitation.  First,  in  2007,  the  National \nAssembly enacted a new customs law that reflects good international practices, including WTO \ncustoms transaction valuations and the Kyoto Convention. It will require some 40 implementing \nregulations  (e.g.,  rules  of  origin,  transaction  value,  and  related  customs  valuation  matters)  of \nwhich  23  implementing  regulations  were  issued  by  September  2008.  Notable  implementing \nregulations include a decree on transit of goods issued in July 2008 and associated guidelines \nin August 2008, procedures for customs declarations, and refunds of customs duty and taxes. \nSecond, to streamline customs procedures and improve transparency, a prakas15 on the use of \nthe  single  administrative  document  was  issued  under  the  new  customs  legislation.  Third, \nASYCUDA was piloted at the Sihanoukville seaport in May 2008, promoting transparency and a \nmodern  customs  information  system  that  provides  timely  tracking  of  export  and  import \nshipments and customs data. It will be fully rolled out to other custom posts under subprogram 2 \nby  mid-2009,  including  the  airport,  petroleum  port,  and  the  Phnom  Penh  dry  port.  Currently, \nSihanoukville  covers  about  one  third  of  trade,  and  coverage  will  be  extended  to  an  estimated \n80%  by  the  end  of  2008.  Fourth,  the  Customs  &  Excise  Department  established  a  risk \nmanagement  unit  responsible  for  establishing  a  risk-based  inspection  system  and  developed \nprocedures  and  manuals  for  this  purpose.  Staff  training  and  operationalization  will  be \nundertaken in subsequent subprograms.  \n \nImprovement of SPS Management Systems. The Government is at an early stage of \n51. \ndeveloping SPS management systems in Cambodia. Under the PED Program, the Government \nwill  implement  measures  to  strengthen  the  institutional  set  up  for  SPS,  enhance  capacity  of \npublic  and  private  agencies  to  implement  SPS,  and  enhance  public  awareness.  The  following \n\n                                                 \n15 A  regulation  issued  by  a  minister  or  by  the  governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  concerning  banking  or \n\nfinancial issues. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\nMedium-Term Program: Triggers for Subprograms 2 and 3 \n\nmeasures  toward  achieving  these  objectives  were  completed  before  Board  consideration  of \nsubprogram 1. \n \n52. \nThree  relevant  decrees  were  issued  to  strengthen  the  institutional  set  up  by  clarifying \nfunctions of agencies. The first decree establishes ISC and outlines its organizational structure \nand functions. ISC will be responsible for producing industrial standards, including those related \nto  agroprocessing.  The  decree  also  mandates  ISC  to  establish  an  accreditation  board.  MIME \nhas agreed to undertake a feasibility of the readiness for an accreditation board and to ensure \nits  independence  from  ISC  in  subsequent  subprograms.  The  second  decree  outlines  the \noperation and functioning of Camcontrol, including its upgrade from an agency to a directorate \ngeneral  status  for  food  safety  surveillance  at  the  wet  markets  and  at  the  retail  level  and  for \nproduct safety at the border. The third decree establishes a special operating agency allowing \nline  agencies  to  commercialize  public  service  obligations  by  providing  the  agency  with  a \nperformance contract and some degree of fiscal autonomy as a way to improve incentives for \nbetter public service delivery. The special operating agency provides an alternative option to the \nexisting  modality  of  creating  a  public  enterprise  with  economic  characteristics.  Where \nappropriate,  the  special  operating  agency  and  public  enterprises  models  will  be  used  to \ncommercialize public service obligations in the SPS sector in subsequent subprograms.  \n \n53. \nThe Government issued decrees to improve SPS in high-risk food sectors. The first is a \ndecree  on  slaughterhouse  management  and  sanitary  inspection  of  animal  products.  ISC  also \nissued seven SPS for food products.  \n \nC. \n \n54. \nThe development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for \nthe next 4 years, building on the reform momentum of subprogram 1. There are 9 triggers for \nsubprogram  2  and  10  triggers  for  subprogram  3.  The  milestones  that  will  be  monitored  for \nsubprograms 2 and 3 are also described in Appendix 2. \n \n55.  Macroeconomic  Stability.  Subprogram 2 has one fiscal policy trigger\u2014to maintain an \nappropriate  current  budget  surplus  to  control  inflation  and  avoid  overheating  of  the  economy. \nThis will mean continuing to accumulate government deposits at the National Bank of Cambodia. \nSubprogram 3 has one  fiscal trigger to continue an appropriate fiscal  policy  stance, which  will \nprovide  a  basis  for  continual  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  on  macroeconomic \npolicy. \n \n56. \nInvestment Climate. There are a series of triggers on RIA and technology policy (Table \n2).  Under  subprogram  2,  MIME  will  begin  institutionalizing  a  RIA  by  implementing  the  action \nplan  developed  under  subprogram  1.  Important  supporting  milestones  will  be  (i)  MOC  will \ndevelop,  adopt,  and  start  implementing  its  action  plan  under  subprogram  2;  (ii)  strengthening \nthe capacity of OBSESS through developing RIA tools and guidelines, (iii) staff training on RIA, \n(iv)  developing  an  information  management  system  that  would  archive  new  regulations  and \nlegislation,  (v)  produce  an  annual  report  on  regulation  performance,  and  (vi)  start  outreach \nprograms  to  selected  line  ministries to  adopt  RIA.  Additional  milestones  under  subprograms  2 \ninclude  MOC  produce  an  action  plan  for  promoting  competition  policy.    Under  subprogram  3, \nthere will be a trigger for implementing a technology and innovation capacity plan, which will be \nsupported  by  a  proposed  ADB  matching  grants  project  for  improving  SME  access  to  SPS \ntechnology. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Investment Policy Triggers for Subprograms 2 and 3 \n\nSubprogram 2 \n\n1.

Under subprogram 2, there are two trade policy triggers (Table 3). First, \nMOC will finalize the legal framework for trade remedy procedures consistent with an economy-\nwide approach that will consider public rather than sectoral interests. Second, the Government \nwill  request  and  substantially  complete  preparations  for  its  first  WTO  trade  policy  review  with \nMOC\u2019s  WTO  Department  acting  as  the  Government\u2019s  focal  point.  Under  subprogram  3,  the \nGovernment will review its most-favored nation tariff structure and develop appropriate across-\nthe-board tariff reforms focusing on the highest tariff rates (35% band). \n \n\nTable 3: Trade Policy Triggers for Subprogram 2 and 3 \n\nSubprogram 2 \n\nSubprogram 3 \n\n1.

There  are  five  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2  and  five  policy \ntriggers  for  subprogram  3  focusing  on  strengthening  the  institutional  framework  for  effective \nSPS management and enhancing capacity to implement SPS (Table 4). Under subprogram 2, \ntriggers  relate  to  signing  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  SPS-related  agencies  to \nclarify  delineation  of  functions,  commercializing  the  MIME  laboratory,  and  developing  an  ISC \nconformity assessment body for SPS management. Under subprogram 3, MIME will undertake \na  feasibility  assessment  of  establishing  a  national  accreditation  board  to  accredit  SPS \nassessors, the MIME laboratory to function on commercial principles, and MIME to develop an \naction  plan  to  commercialize  ISC.  An  important  milestone  under  subprogram  2  will  be  MOC \nprepare  an  action  plan  to  commercialize  Camcontrol\u2019s  laboratory.  Under  subprogram  3,  the \npolicy  trigger  will  be  MOC  endorse  and  start  implementing  its  action plan  to  commercialize  its \nlaboratory.  There  are  two  triggers  for  customs:  (i)  rollout  of  the  ASYCUDA  to  the  other  ports, \nand (ii) an action plan for completion of customs transaction valuation commitments under WTO \nby 2012. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nTable 4: Trade Facilitation Triggers for Subprograms 2 and 3 \nSubprogram 3 \n\nSubprogram 2 \n1.

By  the  end  of  2012,  the  PED  Program  is \nexpected  to  have  improved  Cambodia\u2019s  macroeconomic  stability  through  prudent  fiscal  policy; \nincreased investment and economic diversification through lowered regulatory compliance costs \nand  better  investor  protection;  increased  exports  and  diversification  of  products  through \nimproved  SPS  management  systems  and  private  sector  access  to  SPSs;  reduced  customs \ntrade facilitation costs; and promoting competition. The Program also will have strengthened the \nSPS  management  system,  increased  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  assess  trade  policy  for \nCambodia,  addressed  the  backlog  in  WTO  compliance  and  legal  notifications,  and  improved \nSME access to SPS technology.  \n \n60. \nReforms to investment and trade could add at least 2.4% to Cambodia\u2019s GDP. The \nPED  Program  developed  a  macroeconomic  model  on  the  economy  that  allows  simulations  of \nproposed  reforms  on  the  GDP,  exports,  and  employment.  The  model  includes  a  household \nmicrosimulation  model  that  allows  an  assessment  of  the  reforms  on  household  incomes  and \npoverty. The results of the simulations are presented in Table 5. Transaction costs (both formal \nand  informal)  are  assumed  to  be  involved  in  regulatory  compliance,  and  trade  facilitation \n(customs  facilitation  and  SPS  outreach)  is  halved  from  5%  of  businesses\u2019  turnover  to  2.5%, \nraising  the  GDP  by  1.8%.  Further  rationalization  of  the  customs  tariff  regime  by  cutting  the \neffective rate in half could add 0.6% to the GDP. Both reforms combined would add 2.4% to the \nGDP over the medium-term, an equivalent gain of $200 million (in 2007 prices) to the economy. \nThe  reforms  would  add  to  greater  diversification  of  the  economy  with  large  gains  made  for \npaddy,  chemical,  plastic,  and  rubber  products,  and  transport.  The  reforms  would  increase \nemployment  and  wages,  with  positively  impacting  female  employment,  simulated  to  rise  by \n6.3% from these reforms. In addition, the reforms could lower poverty by 2.7%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nTable 5: Simulated Macroeconomic and Poverty Results from Proposed PED Reforms \n(% change) \n\n \nItem \nReal GDP \n--Import volumes \n  Export volumes \nEmployment wage bill \nEmployment \n-- Male \n-- Female \nHousehold real incomes \nPoverty rate \n\nTransaction Costs Cut in \nHalf \n1.8 \n1.1 \n3.7 \n3.7 \n \n3.3 \n4.7 \n6.0 \n(2.0) \n\n \nRationalization of Tariff Structure \n0.6 \n1.0 \n2.0 \n1.2 \n \n1.0 \n1.6 \n1.8 \n(0.7) \n\n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote:  Transaction  costs  refer  to  reforms  resulting  in  reduction  in  trade  facilitation  costs  at  Customs  and  costs \nassociated with sanitary and phytosanitary standard, and reduction by half in transaction costs of doing business \ninside Cambodia. \n\n    Source:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates  (ADB.  2008. Impact  of  Governance,  Energy  and  Trade  Reforms  on \n\nCambodian Economy and Poverty \u2013 A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis. Manila).  \n\nImportant Features \n\n \nD. \n \n61. \nThe PED Program has some distinct and innovative features. First, the Government has \ndemonstrated  ownership  by  formulating  a  consistent  and  well-sequenced  policy  framework  for \nprivate  sector  reforms  over  the  medium  term,  as  articulated  in  its  SWAp  to  trade  and  DTIS. \nSecond, designed as a program cluster with subsequent subprograms linked by triggers within a \nmedium-term \nthe  PED  Program  encourages  continuous  engagement  by \ndevelopment partners over the medium-term. Third, the central feature of the PED Program is \ncapacity development, which is addressed through  TA, projects and anchoring the program to \nthe  Government\u2019s  SWAp  to  trade.  Fourth,  the  PED  Program  uses  TA  projects  and  grants  to \nstrengthen capacity to enhance private sector competitiveness, which are linked to satisfactory \naccomplishment  of  policy  triggers  or  milestones  (Appendix  8).  This  ensures  government \nownership and an appropriate policy environment for implementation of the TA. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nframework, \n\n62. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  finance  subprogram  1  of  the  PED  Program,  with  terms  and  conditions  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. In addition, \nthe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $2  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to \nfinance institutional capacity development in SPS management systems project.  \n \n63. \nThe loan and grant are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter \nand  policy  matrix  (Appendix  2).  The  loan  size  was  determined  by  the  strength  of  the  policy \npackage, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the development \nfinancing needs of the Government as estimated by MEF. While the eventual economic benefits \nwill  greatly  outweigh  the  costs  (benefits  to  the  economy  are  estimated  to  be  at  least  $200 \nmillion),  the  costs  will  dominate  in  the  short  term.  Despite  a  commitment  to  completing  the \nunfinished  trade  policy  agenda  and  trade  facilitation  measures,  some  segments  of  the \nbureaucracy  and  private  sector  may  resist  further  reforms.  Delays  in  implementing  these \nreforms could result in substantially higher costs for the economy than the adjustment costs, as \nsuch delays would slow the realization of benefits of a lower-cost regulatory and trade regime \nand  therefore  economic  diversification.  Direct  adjustment  costs  include  (i)  foregone  revenues \nand rents resulting from customs reforms, (ii) further reductions in the revenues of the relevant \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\nagencies  and  informal  payments  as  a  result  of  future  reductions  in  red  tape,  (iii)  the  costs  of \nimplementing  trade  facilitation  measures  such  as  customs  reforms  and  strengthening  SPS \nmanagement  systems,  and  (iv)  the  costs  of  rolling  out  the  business  registration  system  to  the \nprovinces and implementing RIA within the Government. \n \n64. \nThe  loan  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government  (Table  6).  The \nPED Program supports the Government\u2019s efforts to increase current budget surpluses although \nits overall budget will remain in deficit as the Government finances development infrastructure. \nThe  Government\u2019s  net  external  financing  needs  will  be  significant  if  it  is  to  sustain  economic \ngrowth of 7.5% per year over the medium term and reduce poverty to 24% by 2015. According \nto  MEF  budget  reports,  the  estimated  net  financing  (external)  requirements  for  2008  are \nestimated at $451.3 million, of which $408.5 million is earmarked for development projects and \n$42.8  million  for  financing  the  budget.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  Government  envisages \nreducing external debt as a percentage of GDP as the economy continues to expand. Recent \ndebt  assessments  by  ADB,  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  World  Bank  indicate  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s debt stock and servicing levels are sustainable over the medium term provided (i) \nfiscal consolidation remains on track, (ii) the economy continues to expand 7.5% per year, and \n(iii) further investment and trade reforms stimulate more private sector growth (Appendix 5). The \n$20  million  loan  and  $2  million  grant  will  help  to  close  the  financing  gap  for  2008,  as  well  as \nsupport the Government\u2019s reforms to investment and trade.  \n \n\nTable 6: Government of Cambodia Projected Development Financing  \nRequirements for 2008 \n\n \nFinancing Mix  \n1.

MOC  will  use  the  private  sector  development  sub-steering \ncommittee on Trade Development and Trade-related Investments (PSC), to be responsible for \ncoordinating the implementation and sustaining the PED policy actions, with MOC, MEF, MIME, \nand relevant line agencies involved in supporting the program. The PSC will meet quarterly to \nmonitor progress and oversee the implementation of the PED program. ADB may be invited to \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nparticipate in the meetings as an observer, and English translations of all meeting minutes must \nbe forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of each meeting. MOC will be responsible for day-to-day \nprogram  implementation  activities  and  will  report  on  implementation  progress.  MOC  also  will \nestablish  a  program  management  unit  and  assign  counterpart  staff  with  qualifications  and \nexperience acceptable to ADB. MEF will be responsible for subprogram 1 disbursements.  \n \n \n \nSubprogram 1 implementation period is from June 2007 to December 2008. All actions \n66. \nincluded  in  the  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  1  were  implemented  before  submission  to  the \nBoard for consideration.    \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n67. \nThe loan will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness (i.e., all conditions in the \nsubprogram  1  policy  matrix  must  be  complied  with  before  release  of  the  tranche).  The  loan \nproceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries  no  more  than  180  days  before  the  loan\u2019s  effectiveness  date.  Items \nspecified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,16 Cambodia  will  be \nthe borrower of the proceeds of the program loan. Supporting import documentation will not be \nrequired  if,  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \nCambodia  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  the  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures  will  be  required.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB \n \n68. \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the loan. \n \n\nThe reform needs supported under the subprogram 1 will be met through local currency \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \n69. \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand the bidding documents for the SPS project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  provides  as  they  relate  to  the  SPS  project.  All  relevant  ADB \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\nguidelines,  including  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  loan \nregulations, were specifically brought to the notice of the Government. \n \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \n70. \nimprove the understanding of fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements \nfor the purpose of the PED Program. This assessment was based on the sector work of ADB\u2019s \nproposed  PFMRD,  as  well  as  the  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  and  Public  Expenditure \nReview  (IFAPER)  for  2003  and  the  Country  Procurement  Assessment  for  2004,  both  led  by \nWorld  Bank.  These  assessments  identified  core  areas  to  address  with  development  partners\u2019 \nsupport.  The  IFAPER  determined  that  the  fiduciary  risk  in  the  use  and  management  of  public \nfunds  was  high.  As  a  consequence,  the  Government  developed  and  began  implementing  a \nmedium-term  public  financial  management  reform  program  (PFMRP)  from  2004  to  2012, \nsupported  by  development  partners.  This  program  increases  the  amount  of  public  resources \nallocated  to  planning  and  management  to  overcome  the  significant  weaknesses  in  the  basic \nsystems and processes for budget preparation, execution and control, reporting, and oversight. \nIt comprises a series of four sequenced platforms, of which platform one was completed in 2007 \nand platform two beginning in 2008 with the  rollout of public financial management reforms to \nthe line ministries. ADB, World Bank, and other development partners are working closely with \nthe Government to implement improved public sector financial management systems. ADB has \nsupported  the  Government\u2019s  program  through  debt  management  TA  at  MEF  and  is  preparing \nPFMRD to support the rollout of the second platform.  \n   \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n71. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen  or  nominate  a  deposit  account  at  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  to  receive  all  loan \nproceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. MOC will be required to submit quarterly progress reports, as well as a final \nreport,  on  the  progress  of  subprogram  1\u2019s  implementation,  which  will  form  part  of  the  PED \nProgram final report if subprogram 2 is approved.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n \n72. \nIn cooperation with the committee (para. 82), ADB will review implementation progress \nand assess the impact of the Program. The Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome \nof  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for \nprogram implementation and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy  proposals.  ADB  will  review  program  performance  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness  to \nassess the outcome of subprogram 1 and to begin preparation of subprogram 2. The review will \n(i) evaluate implementation of the policy reform measures under subprogram 1, and assess the \nimpact on each sector; (ii) describe lessons identified during the program period; and (iii) outline \nreforms  and  assistance  needed  for  development  of  the  sector  to  enable  processing  of \nsubprogram  2.  In  addition,  participants  in  a  Cambodia  private  sector  forum  (partner  agencies, \nbusiness  groups,  and  other  stakeholders)  will  be  encouraged  to  support  private  sector \nmonitoring of the reforms under the PED Program. The project management unit will submit to \nthe  committee  and  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  policy  and  institutional  measures \nimplemented. The reports will be submitted in such form and detail as ADB requests and should \ninclude (i) progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, (ii) steps \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  problems  encountered,  (iii)  the  proposed  detailed  activity  for \nprogram implementation, and (iv) expected progress during the next quarter. \n \n73. \nThe Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \nmonitor  the  PED  Program  implementation  and  evaluate  its  impact  within  the  overall  PED \nframework (Appendix 1). Data for assessing indicators will come from a variety of public sector \nand  stakeholder  sources  including  the  National  Institute  of  Statistics,  the  Council  for  the \nDevelopment  of  Cambodia,  MEF,  and  various  stakeholder  surveys  such  as  the  International \nFinance Corporation\u2019s Doing Business surveys.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT GRANT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n74. \nTo  support  implementation,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  grant  for \ncapacity  development  in  SPS  management  systems.  This  SPS  project  will  be  funded  under  a \ngrant of $2 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.  \n \n75. \nThe  objectives  of  this  SPS  project  are:  (i)  to  support  the  Government  in  strengthening \nthe  SPS  framework  for  effective  SPS  management,  including  clarifying  roles  and  functions \namong the different involved agencies, assisting agencies in operating on a commercial basis, \nand  assisting  the  new  ISC  with  development  of  its  conformity  assessment  body  and  its  ISO \naccreditation;  (ii)  to  improve  SPS  related  to  food  and  water;  and  (iii)  to  enhance  capacity \ndevelopment for effective management systems, such as further upgrading of laboratories (e.g., \nat  MIME),  assisting  with  the  laboratory\u2019s  ISO  accreditations,  procuring  equipment  and  rapid \ndiagnostic tools, and training staff, and strengthening the risk management unit at Camcontrol. \nThis requires substantial investments in institutional capacity development over the longer term \n(3  years)  to  equip  agencies  to  administer  SPS.  The  focus  of  the  SPS  project  is  to  improve \ndelivery  of  services  to  exporters  and  suppliers  to  the  domestic  market.  Improved  SPS,  and \nparticularly  ISO  accreditation,  will  improve  exporters\u2019  international  market  access.  Improved \nSPS management systems will benefit producers and suppliers to the domestic market through \nbetter quality and consumer confidence in products. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n29\n\nB. \n\nProject Cost Estimates \n\n76. \nThe SPS project is estimated to cost $2.36 million equivalent, including estimated taxes \nand duties of $15,000.

This \ncomponent  will  support  key  ministries  concerned  with  the  drafting  of  SPS-related  laws  and \nregulations  by  coordinating  their  activities,  harmonizing  drafts  with  ASEAN  member  countries, \nand  ensuing  that  the  policy  and  legal  framework  has  a  national  perspective,  with  particular \nemphasis on clearly-defined responsibilities. At the same time, the component will seek to gain \nequivalence  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements,  including  standards  that  are  WTO-\ncompliant. \n \n79. \nComponent 2: Capacity Development in SPS Service Providers. This component will \nsupport  the  MIME  laboratory  concerned  with  food  safety  under  MIME  (agro-processing)  to \nstrengthen  its  analytical  capacity  and  capability  to  gain  internationally  recognized  ISO  17025 \ncertification  and  mutual  recognition  for  microbiology  (food  and  water)  and  chemical  (heavy \nmetals,  pesticides,  preservatives  and  colorants)  test  results,  and  to  improve  test  accuracy \nthrough  interproficiency  laboratory  testing.  This  component  will  further  support  Camcontrol  in \nstrengthening risk management procedures and systems for imported food products and in its \nmarket  surveillance  operations.  This  intervention  will  also  assist  the  MIME  laboratory  where \npossible to become commercially-oriented.  \n \nComponent  3:  Capacity  Development  at  the  Institute  of  Standards  of  Cambodia. \n80. \nThis  component  will  assist  ISC  in  national  product,  management  and  process  standards \ndevelopment and to gain international recognition of those standards, recommending the further \ndevelopment  of  standards  for  (i)  high-risk  foods;  (ii)  standards  operating  procedures  for \nslaughterhouses, wet markets, food processors, preparation outlets, and fishing boats; and (iii) \nanalytical  laboratory  procedures.  This  component  will  help  ISC  to  become  an  internationally \naccredited conformity assessment body for process systems under ISO 17021 and to finance a \nfeasibility assessment of establishing a national accreditation body under ISO 17011 guidelines. \nThis intervention will also assist ISC, where possible, to become commercially-oriented.  \n \nE. \n\nProject Implementation Arrangements \n\nthe \n\nindustrial \n\nISC  and \n\nProject  Management.  MIME  will  be  the  EA  for  this  SPS  project.  MOC  will  be  the \n81. \nImplementing  Agency  (IA).  MIME  will  use  the  private  sector  development  sub-steering \ncommittee on Manufacturing and Small and Medium Enterprises (project steering committee or \nPSC),  which  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  and  sustaining  the  SPS \nproject  with  MOC  (Camcontrol)  and  relevant  line  agencies  involved  in  supporting  the  Project. \nThis  arrangement  will  minimize  transaction  costs  and  provide  government-wide  synergy  as \nMIME  houses \nlaboratory.  The  EA  will  (i)  coordinate  project \nimplementation  with  the  IA,  (ii)  carry  out  administrative  and  fiduciary  support,  and  (iii)  support \nboth Government and ADB reporting requirements on the progress and use of the project funds. \nA project implementation unit will be established within the EA. \n \n82. \nPeriod  of  Implementation.  The  SPS  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  3 \nyears. Project activities are scheduled to commence in April 2009 and be completed by March \n2012. The project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n83. \nConsulting  Services  and  Procurement.  The  SPS  project  will  finance  a  team  of  6 \ninternational  and  1  national  consultant  for  implementation.  A  firm  will  be  engaged  using  the \nquality  and  cost-based  selection  method  (80:20)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants.  A  total  of  58  (48  international  and  10  national)  person-months  will  be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n31\n\nrequired.  Project  equipment  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  At  the  request  of  the  Government,  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nadministered  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  As  the  SPS  project  deals  with  MIME  and  MOC  in  areas \nwhere there is agency duplication and unclear delineation of agency functions along the agro-\nbased  product  supply  chain,  the  Government  believes  that  ADB  administration  of  the  SPS \nproject would ensure SPS priorities and reforms are synchronized across agencies. In this way, \nthe SPS project will improve capacity among the agencies to coordinate SPS-related functions \nnecessary for an effective SPS management system. Small or off-the-shelf goods and materials \nvalued at less than $100,000 may be procured under direct purchase arrangements. Items with \nsimilar specifications will be combined into one package, when possible. Laboratory equipment \nwill  be  procured  by  the  MIME  laboratory  based  on  specifications  of  the  consultants.  All \nequipment  procured  under  the  SPS  project  will  be  transferred  to  the  EA  and  IA.  The  terms  of \nreference for the consulting services and their duration are in Supplementary Appendix 1. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 8.  \n \nDisbursement Arrangements. The ADB grant proceeds will be disbursed according to \n84. \nthe procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo  speed  up  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  grant  proceeds  for  eligible \nexpenditures,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  for  the  EA  by  the  Government  at  a \ncommercial bank chosen by the National Bank of Cambodia and acceptable to ADB. The ceiling \nof the accounts and the initial amounts deposited will be 6 months of estimated expenditures to \nbe financed through an imprest account, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The \nimprest  account  will  be  managed  and  administered  by  the  EA.  The  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure  may  be  used  when  seeking  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nadvances made into the imprest accounts.  Each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under \nthe statement of expenditure will not exceed the equivalent of $10,000. \n \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  EA,  assisted  by  the  team  leader,  will \n85. \nmaintain separate project accounts and financial statements in accordance with the provisions \nof  the  Grant  Agreement  and  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  (2002)  and  will  have  them  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. During project implementation, within 6 months of the \nend of each fiscal year, the EA will submit to ADB certified copies of the annual audited project \naccounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, which will include a separate \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures,  and \nmanagement  letter,  in  English.  The  EA  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB, \nindicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered,  and  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  a \nprogram of activities, and expected progress during the implementation period. The reports will \nincorporate the project performance monitoring data and all relevant financial data. The EA will \nalso  provide  reports  and  information  relating  to  the  SPS  project  as  ADB  reasonably  requests. \nWithin 3 months after project completion, the EA will submit to ADB a project completion report \ndetailing information on project implementation and accomplishment of the project activities. \n \nProject  Performance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Reporting.  The  Government  and \n86. \nADB  will  undertake  joint  reviews  of  the  SPS  project  every  6  months  to  assess  progress  in \ncomponent activities, the quality of activities and the outputs produced, the performance of the \nproject,  and  identify  issues  and  challenges.  The  EA  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  midterm  review \ncovering  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  achievements  against  the  SPS  project\u2019s  expected \nimpact  and  outcomes,  and  the  modification  of  implementation  arrangements  where  necessary \nfor the successful completion of the SPS project.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nis  proposed \n\nIn  connection  with  the  PED  Program,  a  policy  and  advisory  TA  grant  for  enhancing \n87. \nprivate  sector  competitiveness \nto  support  capacity  development  and \nimplementation  of  the  policy  triggers  under  subprogram  2.  The  TA  is  estimated  at  a  cost  of \n$960,000,  of  which  $800,000  is  proposed  to  be  financed  by  the  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund (Appendix 9). \n \nThe TA will support the implementation of the triggers for subprogram 2 and provide the \n88. \nGovernment with timely  policy advice on a demand  basis. The objective of the TA is to assist \nthe Government in finding practical solutions to address these issues, as well as to deepen the \nGovernment\u2019s  agenda  in  the  investment  and  trade  area  under  the  PED  Program.  It  has  five \ntrade  policy  and  competition  policy  capacity \ncomponents.  Component  1  will  support \ndevelopment at MOC, including assisting in capacity development at the new WTO Department, \ndeveloping  trade  remedies,  developing  a  competition  policy  framework,  and  facilitating  its \nadoption.  This  will  include  undertaking  a  series  of  case  studies  on  anticompetitive  practices. \nThis component will also assist MOC with rolling out its enterprise registry to selected provinces. \nComponent 2 will support MOC and MIME to implement action plans for regulatory review and \nstrengthen capacity at OBSESS. Component 3 will assist MIME to develop a technology policy \nframework.  Component  4  will  support  MEF  to  develop  frameworks  for  double  taxation \nagreements  and  advocating  their  adoption  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  investment  promotion \nregime. Component 5 will work with the Customs & Excise Department to strengthen capacity at \nthe risk management unit and to undertake a study on Cambodia\u2019s readiness to join the Kyoto \nConvention. MOC will be the EA for the TA. The TA budget and implementation arrangements \nare in Appendix 9. The terms of references are in Supplementary Appendix 2.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nThe key benefits expected from the PED Program are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nLowered  transaction  costs  for  businesses  because  of  reduction  in  red  tape  and \ncustoms  reforms  which  will  open  new  opportunities,  increase  trade,  investment \nand productivity, boost the economy, increase incomes, and create jobs.  \nStrengthened  institutional  development  by  improving  the  capabilities  of  the  EA \nand  IAs  to  carry  out  trade  and  competition  policy  analysis  with  the  aim  of \nupgrading the quality of policy and institutional processes for policy making. \nUpgraded  agro-based  products  and  improved  market  access  through  effective \nSPS  management  systems.  It  will  also  improve  food  safety  for  the  booming \ntourism sector and contribute to improved food safety for the population. \nImproved private sector capacity in SPS and related technologies through grant \nprojects, which will also improve firm competitiveness. \nMaintained a stable macroeconomy through prudent fiscal policy. \n\n(v) \n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe PED Program is subject to the following risks.  \n\n(i) \n\nIn  transition  economies,  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability\u2013\u2013as  reflected,  for \nexample,  in  low  inflation\u2013\u2013is  crucial  for  investor  confidence  and  private  sector \n\nA. \n \n89. \n \n\nB. \n \n90. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n33\n\ngrowth.  Cambodia  will  be  particularly  vulnerable  to  macroeconomic  instability  in \n2008  and  2009  due  to  the  recent  surge  in  inflation  that  may  slow  household \nspending,  the  global  financial  crisis  that  may  slow  foreign  direct  investment \ninflows  to  Cambodia,  and  the  expected  United  States  and  European  economic \nrecessions that will hurt Cambodian merchandise exports to these markets.  \nThere  may  be  weak  coordination  among  government  agencies,  leading  to \ndelayed compliance with policy measures and capacity development. By basing \nfinancial assistance and TA on completed actions derived from the Government\u2019s \nreform program, the PED Program strengthens the Government\u2019s ownership. By \nincluding  policy  triggers  for  subsequent  subprograms,  the  PED  Program  offers \nthe  flexibility  needed  to  take  into  account  changes  in  the  external  environment \nfaced  by  Cambodia  and  emerging  priority  policy  reforms.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment  has  taken  a  clear  stance  on  the  need  for  policy  adjustment  to \ndiversify the economy, as articulated in its SWAp to trade and DTIS.  \nThe capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained by resources \nand other emerging priorities. The PED Program reduces this risk by limiting the \npolicy  triggers  to  a  few  high-priority,  high-impact  policy  reforms  under  the \njurisdiction  of  MOC  and  MIME  and  by  attaching  TA  to  each  trigger  and  the \ncapacity development grant to strengthened SPS management systems.  \nVested  interests  will  resist  some  of  the  reforms.  Reforms  to  customs  and \ninstitutionalization  of  economic  governance  reforms\u2013\u2013i.e.,  regulatory  impact \nassessments\u2013\u2013are  likely  to  be  drawn-out.  However,  several  factors  mitigate \nthese risks. First, the PED strategic approach is to focus efforts on supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s initiatives and building on existing institutions. Second, reforms will \nfocus  on  areas  with  political  will  and  some  measure  of  capacity.  This  has  been \ndemonstrated  by  MOC,  which  has  championed  trade  reforms,  lead  the  WTO \naccession  process,  and  now  leads  the  trade  development  agenda  (e.g.,  the \nSWAp to trade). \n\n \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n91. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nPromptly  adopt  and  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the  polices  and  program \nactions  indicated  under  subprogram  1  of  the  PED  Program  as  specified  in  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  (Appendix  2)  including  the  policy  matrix,  and  ensure \nthat such policies and actions are sustained. \nActively  assist  and  support  the  PSC  to  undertake  ongoing  PED  Program \nmonitoring and evaluation by facilitating consultation with agencies and other key \nstakeholders as appropriate. \nKeep ADB informed of policy discussions with other stakeholders on measures to \nensure effective implementation of the PED Program. \nGive  ADB  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  relevant  studies,  proposed  policy \nchanges,  and  draft  laws  or  decrees  that  are  likely  to  impact  on  PED  Program\u2019s \nobjectives and implementation.  \nEnsure  sufficient  project  counterpart  funds,  including  all  government  allocations \nfor implementation, staffing, and operation and maintenance of project facilities, \nare  readily  available  and  the  submission  of  budgetary  allocation  requests  are \nmade in a timely manner.

From \n2003 to 2007, economic growth averaged around 10.5%, and the gross domestic product (GDP) \nper  capita  increased  by  over  70%  to  $598.  Based  on  the  $2-per-day  poverty  line,  poverty \nincidence  declined  by  1.6  million  persons  (18%)  during  the  same  period  (Figure  A4.1),  and \npoverty  reduction  accelerated  after  2004  when  per  capita  income  surpassed  $400.  The \neconomic  growth  has  been  supported  mainly  by  the  manufacturing,  construction,  and  the \nservice  sectors.  The  manufacturing  sector  was  driven  by  garment  making,  mainly  for  export, \nwhich  made  the  industry  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  The  service  sector  depends  on  \ntourism-related  activities;  international  visitors  to  Cambodia  continue  to  increase,  with  over  2 \nmillion  people  traveling  in  2007,  generating  over  $1  billion  in  revenues.  More  recently,  the \nconstruction sector has become fast-growing, owing to large-scale public infrastructure projects \nand an increasing demand for residential properties. Several foreign investors have also moved \nforward with major property development projects. \n \n3. \nCambodia\u2019s  economy  has  undergone  significant  structural  transformation  since  1990, \nbut  remains  narrowly  based,  with  three  sectors\u2014garments,  construction,  and  tourist-related \nservices\u2014accounting  for  42%  of  GDP  in  2007.  The  share  of  industry  increased  from  11%  of \nGDP in 1990 to 25% in 2007, while the agriculture sector share declined from 5% to 30% during \nthe same period and the service sector expanded from 33% to 39% (Figure A4.1). Cambodia\u2019s \nstructural  transformation  has  been  dependent  on  a  few  products.  Unrestricted  access  to  the \nUnited  States  (US)  and  European  Commission  markets  from  the  early  to  late  1990s  \njump-started  the  garment  sector,  and  preferential  access  (or  less  restrictive  arrangement \nrelative  to  other  countries)  to  the  US  market  after  1999  also  drove  this  growth.  The  garment \nsector  accounts  for  70%  of  the  manufacturing  sector  (12%  of  GDP)  and  70%  of  Cambodia\u2019s \nexport revenue. The ancient temples at Angkor have attracted a continuous flow of international \ntourists  and  became  the  catalyst  of  growth  for  the  service  sector  (Figure  A4.1).  While  the \ngarment  and  service  sectors  have  attracted  significant  foreign  direct  investment  in  the  past, \nsizeable foreign direct investment has recently moved to the construction sector (Figure A4.1). \nThis  pattern  of  structural  change  is  expected  as  an  economy  grows  and  develops;  resources \nmove  from  low-productivity  activities  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  traditional  services  to \nhigher-productivity  activities  in  industry  and  other  modern  services.  This  process,  and  the \nassociated  rural-to-urban  migration  that  occurs  with  this  transformation,  contributes  to  a \nreduction in poverty. \n \n4. \nThe  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  sector  dominates  economic  activity  in \nCambodia  and  accounts  for  substantial  employment.  According  to  latest  available  data  from \nMinistry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME),  there  are  31,149  small  industrial  SMEs  with \nfewer  than  50  employees.  However,  with  so  many  unlicensed  establishments,  it  is  difficult  to \nestimate the actual number of SMEs, especially the very small ones. Based on available data, \nfood,  beverage,  and  tobacco  manufacturers  represent  the  largest  number  (82%)  of  small \nindustrial  establishments.  In  the  past,  many  Cambodian  SMEs  were  unregistered,  primarily \nbecause  of  the  high  cost,  cumbersome  procedures,  and  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nregistration  process.  The  cost  of  registration  until  mid-2004  was  about  $1,000  (four  times  per \ncapita  GDP).  Businesses  that  did  register  often  paid  facilitators  to  help  them  negotiate  the \ncomplex and confusing procedures involved. In 2004, the cost of registration was cut to $177, \nand in 2007, it was cut again to $105. \n \n5. \nIn the short term, Cambodia\u2019s economy is vulnerable to two external developments. First, \nthe  surge  in  domestic  inflation  fueled  by  global  oil  and  food  price  inflation  is  impacting  on  the \neconomy  and  may  be  slowing  household  consumption.  Cambodia\u2019s  agriculture  sector  will \nbenefit  from  high  international  commodity  prices,  but  at  the  same  time,  higher  overall  food \nprices  will  adversely  affect  the  most  vulnerable,  in  particular  the  urban  poor  and  the  landless. \nSecond,  the  expected  contraction  in  the  US  and  European  economies  is  affecting  garment \nexports,  with  exports  virtually  stagnant  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008.  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  staff  estimates  suggest  that  fuel  price  increases  could  reduce  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \ngrowth rate by up to 3% in 2008 (down to 7%). Over the medium term, the garment sector will \nbe  challenged  by  increasing  regional  competition  in  the  US  market,  and  its  contribution  to \neconomic growth will continue to diminish. In fact, its contribution to growth fell to 1.2% in 2007 \nfrom  an  average  of  2.3%  between  2004  and  2006.  Third,  the  global  financial  crisis  may  slow \nforeign  direct  investment  into  Cambodia.  The  recent  external  developments  also  highlight  that \nsustainable  high  growth  will  require  diversification  of  the  sources  of  growth  beyond  garments, \ntourism, and construction, which will also reduce Cambodia\u2019s vulnerability to external economic \nshocks. \n \n6. \nRecent investment surveys and several value-chain studies have identified impediments \nto  Cambodia  realizing  its  medium-term  growth  potential  and  economic  diversification.  Surveys \non business climate perceptions suggest that, among other factors, regulatory uncertainty and \nexcessive red tape, remaining distortions in the trade regime, electricity costs, inadequate skills \nof the labor force, and corruption are major obstacles to private sector growth and development. \nValue-chain studies identify poor product quality, an inadequate standards and phytostandards \n(SPS)  policy  framework,  underdeveloped  links  between  the  rural  and  modern  sectors  of  the \neconomy,  and  relatively  costly  logistics  as  constraints  to  export  diversification.  A  common \nthread  in  many  value-chain  studies  is  Cambodia\u2019s  weak  competition  policy  framework  broadly \ndefined to include remaining distortions at the border and behind the border. There are lessons \nfrom  the  successful  sectors  of  garments  and  tourism  for  the  development  of  other  sectors,  in \nparticular  regarding  maintaining  investor  confidence.  Cambodia  must  provide  a  predictable \npolicy  environment  for  the  sector  and  maintain  access  to  international  inputs  at  close  to \ninternational  prices.  Going \ninvestor  confidence  and  policy \nimprovements \npredictability\u2014such  as  implementation  of  double  taxation  agreements\u2014would  help  to  diversify \ninvestments. \n \n\nforward, \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fFigure A4.1: Recent Economic Performance in Cambodia \n\n(i) Poverty Incidence and Per Capita Income \n            (% of population and $) \n\n  (ii) Structural Transformation, 1990 \u2013 2007 \n                          (% of GDP) \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n49\n\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\n1990 1994 1996 1998\n\n2002 2004\n\n2007\n\n2004\n\nPovRate\n\nPCY\n\nAgriculture Industry  Services\n\n   \n                                                                                  \n   \n \n\n(iii) Foreign Direct Investment 2000\u20132007                        (iv) International Visitors 2000 \u2013 2007       \n                           ($ million)                                                                       (\u2018000) \n\n                \n\n                             \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003  2004  2005 2006 2007\n\n               \n\n     \n\n(v) Garment Exports ($ billion)                                         (vi) Newly Registered Enterprises 2000\u20132007 \n \n\n(units)        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\n   \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: National Institute of Statistics Cambodia, World Bank, Council for Development of Cambodia, and Ministry \nof Tourism. \n\n            \n\n \n\n \n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n3500\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n700 \n600 \n500 \n400 \n300 \n200 \n100 \n0 \n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n \n \n \n\n   \n \n    \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nMedium-Term Growth Issues \n\nB. \n \n\n7. \nThis section summarizes the key business climate impediments to private sector growth \nand  economic  diversification.  While  much  progress  has  been  done  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector to grow in Cambodia, much more needs to be done to lower \ntransaction  costs  through  addressing  excessive  red  tape,  improving  the  investment  climate, \ncompleting the unfinished trade policy agenda, and strengthening trade facilitation.  \n \nTransaction  costs  for  doing  business  in  Cambodia  are  high,  but  much  lower  than  they \n8. \nonce were. Cambodia continues to rank low in several international surveys of competitiveness \ndue  to  high  transaction  costs  in  the  regulatory  environment,  trade  facilitation,  and  an \nundeveloped  logistics  sector.  Figure  A4.3  shows  that  trade  facilitation  costs  in  Cambodia  are \nhigh  on  a  regional  and  international  comparison.  The  2007  World  Bank  Investment  Climate \nSurvey  of  enterprises \nincluding \nreported  several  major  constraints \nmacroeconomic  instability,  energy  costs,  regulation,  labor  skills,  anticompetitive  and  informal \npractices.  \n\nin  Cambodia, \n\n9. \nBusiness surveys in Cambodia, as well as a regional comparison, consistently indicate \nelectricity  cost  is  a  barrier  to  improved  business  competitiveness.  The  average  tariff  is  about \n$0.146  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  Phnom  Penh,  and  $0.25\u20130.80/kWh  in  remote  areas.  The \nElectricity Development Corporation continues to struggle with the high power generation costs, \nwhich  are  primarily  due  to  (i)  the  expensive  power  purchased  from  independent  power \nproducers,  (ii)  small-scale  generation  capacity,  which  makes  electricity  more  expensive  as \neconomies  of  scale  are  not  achieved,  and  (iii)  limited  access  to  the  capital  markets.  Power \nprices  are  relatively  high  given  that  the  power  supply  system  is  dispersed  and  fragmented. \nExcept for Phnom Penh and some towns near the Thailand and Viet Nam borders, the supply \ntypically comes from a mini-distribution network fed by small number of diesel generators. The \nsouth  electricity  grid  covering  the  capital  city,  Phnom  Penh,  is  the  main  grid  with  a maximum \ndemand of about 276 megawatts. The limited power grid coverage and unreliable power supply \nhave compelled many large consumers to invest in self-generation at a very high cost and poor \nefficiency.  Several  development  partners  are  assisting  the  government  with  expansion  of  the \nsector.  The  Government  of  Japan  (JICA  and  JBIC),  German  Development  Bank  (KfW),  the \nNordic  Development  Fund,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  the  World  Bank  are  financing \nvarious  projects \nin  hydropower  (People\u2019s  Republic  of  China),  electricity  generation, \ntransmission  lines,  and  rural  electrification.    ADB  has  a  proposed  standby  loan  in  the  2010 \npipeline  for  rural  electrification  with  the  intention  of  adding  100km  of  line  transmission.  ADB \nstaff estimates indicate that investments in electricity, which bring domestic prices toward the \nregional  average,  would  add  up  to  5%  to  the  GDP  and  facilitate  economic  diversification.1 \nSeveral  development  partners  are  also  assisting \nimproving  road \ninfrastructure.  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  several  bilateral  development  partners  are  financing \nroad projects. ADB, Government of Japan and the World Bank are cofinancing the Road Asset \nManagement program of the Cambodian government.   \n \n10. \nIn  addition,  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  Trade  Restrictiveness  Index  shows  that \nwhile nontariff barriers are relatively low, tariff rates are relatively restrictive compared to other \ncountries in the region. Moreover, as Cambodia begins implementing SPS, care will need to be \ntaken to ensure that there is not a proliferation of SPS-related technical barriers to trade.  \n\nthe  government \n\nin \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2008.

A  cross-countries  study  conducted  by  the \nWorld Bank2 suggests that high logistics costs and, more importantly, low level of services are \nbarriers  to  trade  and  hence,  growth.  Available  indicators  suggest  that  Cambodian  businesses \nbear higher cost of logistics than other countries in the region. The logistics performance index \nranks  Cambodia  above  most  countries  in  the  region,  meaning  it  is  less  efficient.  This  index  is \ndeveloped based on a comprehensive survey of supply chain performance, including customs \nprocedures,  logistic  costs,  infrastructure  quality,  timeliness  of  reaching  destination,  and  the \ncompetence of the domestic logistics industry. \n \n12. \nThe Government has taken several steps to streamline import\u2013export procedures. As a \nresult,  days  required  to  process  document  for  imports  and  exports,  as  well  as  costs  to  export \nper container, have declined. However, Cambodia is still significantly behind other countries in \nthe  region  in  terms  of  import\u2013export  times  and  costs  (Figure  A4.3).  More  recently,  the \nGovernment  implemented  important  reforms  to  further  improve  trade  facilitation,  including  (i) \nintroduction of a single administrative document, (ii) the pilot ASYCUDA3 in Sihanoukville, which \nis expected to be rolled out to four other major ports accounting for 80% of trade by the end of \n2008, (iii) passage of the new customs law, and (iv) a risk management unit at the Customs & \nExcise  Department\u2019s  central  office.  While  these  reforms  are  still  in  early  phases  of \nimplementation,  full  implementation  of  the  single  administrative  document  and  ASYCUDA  will \nfacilitate  trade,  improve  transparency  of  trade-related  procedures,  and  reduce  costs  for  the \nprivate sector. \n\n                                                 \n2 World Bank. 2007.

Improving SPS management systems \nand  capacity  to  administer  SPS  is  crucial  to  lowering  the  high  incidence  of  food-  and  water-\nrelated  diseases  and  to  create  confidence  in  the  tourist-related  food  sector.  Much  has  been \ndone in the last 2 years to improve SPS management related to food products. The Government \nhas  passed  a  standards  law,  issued  a  decree  to  establish  the  Institute  of  Standards  of \nCambodia (ISC), and upgraded laboratory testing at MIME and Camcontrol. An interministerial \ncommittee  has  been  established  to  oversee  policy  developments  in  the  sector.  However,  the \nGovernment  recognizes  that  further  reforms  are  required,  including:  (i)  strengthening  the  SPS \nframework  for  effective  SPS  management;  (ii)  improved  SPS  regulation  related  to  food  and \nwater;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  effective  management  systems  such  as  further \nlaboratories\u2019 \nupgrading  of \nInternational  Organization  for  Standardization  accreditation  so  that  tests  are  internationally \nrecognized, procuring equipment and rapid diagnostic tools, and training staff. \n \nThere  are  three  major  weaknesses  linked  to  SPS  in  Cambodia.  First,  several \n14. \ngovernment agencies are involved in SPS-related matters at different points in the supply chain. \nWhile this is common in many countries, Cambodia duplicates functions, which add costs and \nuncertainty  for  the  private  sector.  For  example,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and \nFisheries;  Camcontrol;  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  carry  out  similar  inspections  of  food  related \nproducts  at  the  border.  Thus,  it  is  important  that  the  different  agencies  clarify  functions  to \nminimize  duplication.  Second,  the  Government  has  established  ISC,  which  is  mandated  to \nproduce  SPS  and  to  establish  a  body  to  accredit  assessors  that  certify  product  and  process \nSPS  in  the  private  sector.  This  accreditation  body  has  not  yet  been  established,  and  best \ninternational practices indicate that it should be separate from ISC to avoid a conflict of interest. \nThird,  there  is  limited  participation  of  private  sector  in  providing  SPS-related  services  to  the \nmarket. To a certain extent, this is due to the underdeveloped market for SPS-related services \nin  Cambodia,  which  in  turn  is  influenced  by  the  inadequate  legislative  framework.  Larger \nCambodian  firms  have  overcome  these  obstacles  by  hiring  assessors  from  Thailand,  US,  and \nViet Nam to certify SPS; however, this approach is expensive for SMEs. It is important that SPS \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n53\n\nreforms and capacity development efforts promote private sector participation through eventual \naccreditation  of  private  sector  assessors  and  privately-owned  laboratories.  It  is  also  important \nthat regional competition in this sector remains in Cambodia. \n \nExisting  public  sector  providers  of  SPS-related  services,  such  as  the  laboratories  and \n15. \ninspection  agencies,  have  limited  capacity  to  provide  effective  services  to  the  private  sector. \nThis  arises  due  to  constrained  budgets  and  inadequate  equipment.  The  new  MIME  testing \nlaboratory was built by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, but its budget \nfunded  under  MIME  is  considered  inadequate  to  provide  services  to  the  private  sector.  Best \ninternational  practices  suggest  that  laboratories  should  be  commercialized  and  fiscally \nautonomous  or  even  privatized.  Similarly,  the  newly  established  ISC,  also  funded  under  the \nMIME  budget,  produces  SPS,  which  can  be  commercialized  as  has  occurred  in  many  other \ncountries. \n \n16. \nThe majority of investors surveyed in the 2007 World Bank Investment Climate Survey \nconsidered access to finance and the cost of finance not to be major obstacles to their growth\u2014\nonly  15%  of  businesses  thought  the  cost  of  finance  was  a  major  constraint  and  only  10%  of \nbusiness  considered  access  to  finance  a  problem.  Data  on  loan  growth  and  interest  rates \nappear to corroborate the findings of the survey and demonstrate that progress has been made \nin  improving  financial  intermediation  and  efficiency.  The  number  of  Cambodians  that  have \naccessed  bank  or  microfinance  loans  has  increased  80%  since  2004,  from  0.5  million \ncustomers  to  0.9  million  by  2007.  Credit  to  the  private  sector  expanded  80%  in  2007  and  by \n107%  in  April  2008.  Consequently, loans  to  the  GDP  increased  from  8.5%  of  GDP  in  2004  to \n18.5%  of  GDP  by  2007  (Figure  A4.4).  Although  a  large  proportion  of  recent  credit  growth  are \nallocated  to  construction,  real  estate,  and  personal  consumption,  the  share  of  lending  to \nagriculture  also  increased  significantly  to  5.0%  from  2.8%  in  2005.  Lending  from  microfinance \ninstitutes has also increased by 500% since 2004, with minimum nonperforming loans. Most of \nthis  lending  is  allocated  to  agriculture  sector  in  rural  areas.  On  the  cost  of  lending,  nominal \ninterest  rates  have  been  declining  toward  the  regional  average.  Currently,  dollar  lending  rates \nare  in  the  range  of  15%  per  year,  down  1%  from  a  year  earlier.  Interest  rates  on  riel  loans \n(which account for about 10% of total loans) are in the range of 20% to 25% per year, which are \nnot  out  of  line  with  regional  rates.  In  Indonesia  and  Thailand,  interest rates  on small  business \nloans range between 11% and 15% (in local currency), and in the Philippines, the average rate \nis about 12%. The average interest margin in the Cambodian banking sector has also declined \n1%  in  the  last  12  months  to  11%,  although  it  remains  relatively  high  in  the  region.  Increased \ncompetition  in  the  commercial  banking  sector  and  improvements  in  intermediation  have \ncontributed to the gradual decline in lending rates. Much of the new competition has come from \nlocally-incorporated branches of foreign banks, which have been aggressive in pricing their way \ninto the local market.  \n \nStill,  Cambodia  has  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of  banking  intermediation  in  the  world. \n17. \nVarious obstacles constrained credit expansion, but key among them was weak legal framework \nfor commercial and banking activities, which caused a generally high credit risk in the economy. \nMoreover,  the  payments  system  is  underdeveloped,  primarily  because  Cambodia  remains  in \ntransition from a devastated economy in the 1980s (brought about by the civil war in the 1970s) \nto a modern market economy. Its institutions and the capacity to support them are still evolving \nand  developing.  Nevertheless,  the  Government  has  made  significant  progress  in  addressing \nthese  constraints.  On  the  supply  side,  the  Government,  with  assistance  of  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nSector  Development  Program,  has  established  financial  sector  development  framework  to  (i) \nstrengthen  banking  supervision;  (ii)  support  money  and  interbank  market  development;  (iii) \nestablish  a  legal  framework  in  support  of  corporate  borrowing,  including  a  body  of  civil  and \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\ncommercial laws and a system for secured transactions and accounting standards; (iv) support \nfor insurance sector reforms; and (v) enhance investment in long-term  development of human \ncapacity through training institutes and professional associations. On the supply side, under an \nADB  SME  development  loan,  the  Government  has  enacted  the  Secured  Transaction  Law, \nestablished a credit information system, and introduced a simplified financial reporting template \nfor  SMEs.  To  improve  the  availability  of  collateral,  the  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nWorld Bank and the Governments of Finland and Germany, has also introduced systematic land \nregistration. The geographical coverage of systematic land registration has expanded from 11 to \n15 provinces and municipalities. \n \n18. \nimprove business environment and enhance trade facilitation:  \n \n\nThe Government has outlined the following strategy, supported by the PED Program, to \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  and  MIME  will  formulate  action  plans  to \ninstitutionalize  a  RIA  in  their  ministries.

The  Government  will  prepare  several  SPSs-related \nagencies  for  commercialization  to  ensure  financial  sustainability,  among  other \nthe \nmeasures.  The  PED  Program  will  provide \nGovernment to support its SPS reform agenda.  \nThe PED Program will provide technical assistance to prepare an action plan for \nimplementing customs transaction valuation commitments under the World Trade \nOrganization.  \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\n(iv) \n\nto \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A4.4: Banking Sector Indicators \n\n \n      (i)   Bank Loans and Deposits to GDP Ratio                  \n  \n \n\n2004 to 2007 \n \n\n \n(%) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n(ii) Domestic Credit to Private Sector \u2013 Regional \n      Comparison in 2007 \n \n\n(%) \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n55\n\n30 \n25 \n20 \n15 \n10 \n\n5\n\n0\n\n18 \n16 \n14 \n12 \n10 \n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nLao PDR\n\nCambodia\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nLoans\n\nDeposits\n\nSpread\n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n% of GDP\n\nLoans to GDP\n\nDeposits to GDP\n\n \n\n    \n \n    (iii) Interest Rates and Spreads on Loans and            \n         Deposits in Cambodia 2008                                  \n \n\n                                        (%) \n\n \n\n(iv) Interest Rate Spreads - Regional Comparison    \n \n                         (%)                         \n\nin 2006  \n\n \n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n    \nGDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSources: National Bank of Cambodia and central banks of various countries. \n     \n\n   \n\nCa m bodia\n\nIndonesia\n\nLao P D R\n\nM alaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Na m\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS 2 \nMACROECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n\nInflation \n\nThis assessment provides a summary of developments in macroeconomic policy. It also \n\n \n1. \npresents a summary assessment of debt sustainability. \n \n2. \nThe  immediate  pressing  issue  is  the  acceleration  in  domestic  price  inflation  and  its \npotential impact on growth conditions in Cambodia and its poor. While much has been done to \nput fiscal policy on a sound path, critical issues that face the Government over the medium term \ninclude further efforts to raise revenues, improving efficiency in public expenditure management, \nstrengthening debt management systems, and managing potential oil revenues. Important risks \ninclude  weaker  external  demand  and  heightened  regional  competition  for  Cambodia\u2019s  main \nexport  commodities.  The  Government  has  outlined  measures  to  address  inflation  and  has  a \nfiscal sustainability strategy supported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) programs.   \n \nA. \n \n3. \nAfter remaining in single digits in the previous years, inflation rose significantly starting in \nSeptember  2007.  From  an  average  of  3.9%  from  December  2002  to  2006,  year-on-year \nconsumer price inflation1 surged to 10.8% in December 2007 and 25.7% in May 2008. The data \nsuggest that inflation pressures have eased since June, but inflation remained high at 22.3% in \nJuly. \n \n4. \nThe  sharp  increase  in  inflation  reflects  both  external  shocks  and  domestic  pressures. \nAvailable data suggests that three factors contributed to Cambodia\u2019s surge in domestic inflation \nsince the fourth quarter of 2007. First, the surge in global oil and food prices quickly transmitted \nto  domestic  food  inflation  [Figure  A5.1(i)  and  (ii)].  Second,  the  depreciation  of  the  riel  and  the \nUnited  States  (US)  dollar  against  the  currencies  of  Cambodia's  other  major  trading  partners \nadded to imported inflation. Third, there were signs that the domestic economy was beginning to \noverheat in 2007. Tentative evidence indicates that aggregate domestic demand was beginning \nto  significantly  diverge  from  its  potential  growth  path  in  part  fueled  by  very  high  growth  in \ncommercial bank lending [Figure A5.1 (iii) and (iv)]. Broad money grew at 61% year-on-year in \nDecember  2007  due  to  large  capital  inflows,  and  credit  to  the  private  sector  expanded  at  a \nrecord level of 76%. Credit growth to the private sector has moderated, expanding by 35% from \nJanuary to July 2008.  \n \nResponding  to  increasing  inflationary  pressure,  the  Government  announced  a  policy \n5. \npackage  in  April  2008.  On  the  monetary  side,  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  would  double \nbanks\u2019  reserve  requirements  from  8%  to  16%,  facilitate  banks  with  strong  finances  to  invest \nabroad,  strengthen  supervision,  and  provide  guidelines  to  reduce  bank  lending  to  high-risk \nsectors, especially real estate. On the fiscal side, the Government will maintain the balance of \nthe national budget as stated in the Public Financial Management Law and Reform Program. At \nthe  same  time,  the  Government  will  try  its  best  to  increase  its  deposits  in  the  banking  system \nand mobilize revenue more than budgeted. Consideration is also given to reducing import tariffs \non basic goods while balancing the loss revenue against increased taxes on luxury goods. The \npackage  also  includes  other  measures,  such  as:  (i)  fixing  indirect  taxes  to  hold  down  the \ndomestic  price  of  petrol,  (ii)  providing  a  financing  provision  for  the  rice  industry  to  increase \nproduction, (iii) reducing government consumption of fuel and electricity, (iv) lifting an import ban \non  pork,  (v)  suspending  the  1%  minimum  tax  on  the  garment  industry  to  finance  increases  in \n\n                                                 \n1  Price inflation is measured by the Phnom Penh Retail Price Index. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n57\n\nworkers\u2019 wages for 3 years, (vi) increasing salaries and allowances to government officials, the \narmed forces, and retirees by 20%, and (viii) providing fuel subsidies to the electricity company \nto maintain electricity prices. \n \nWhile  the  package  contains  several  key  elements,  its  implementation  could  be \n6. \nstrengthened in many areas. ADB staff study suggests that a large part of inflationary pressures \ncan be explained by trading partners\u2019 inflation, which will not be eased by domestic policy action. \nHowever,  second-round  effects  and  domestically  sourced  inflation  will  require  swift  action. \nUnder  the  current  dollarized  economy,  maintaining  a  prudent  fiscal  stance  is  essential  to \nmoderating inflation pressures. A clear target to limit the overall budget deficit to around 1% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 and to continue to accumulate government deposits in \nthe National Bank of Cambodia above its current level of 6% of the GDP to about 8% is key to \ncontain  inflation  pressures.  This  will  require  ongoing  strong  revenue  efforts  and  restraining \nnonpriority  recurrent  spending  to  finance  additional  spending  from  announced  measures.  The \nGovernment should also safeguard priority spending and make room for targeted measures to \nprotect  the  poor  within  a  prudent  fiscal  envelope.  The  decision  to  tighten  monetary  policy  to \ncomplement  fiscal  prudence  is  appropriate  to  rein  in  very  high  credit  growth,  but  its \nimplementation  could  be  accelerated.  Measures  such  as  cutting  taxes  or  increasing  subsidies \nare unlikely to address the inflation problem and are not recommended as they reduce budget \nrevenues at a time when creating fiscal space is important for priority spending. Moreover, these \nare poorly targeted measures if intended to alleviate costs to the vulnerable poor.  \n \nB. \n \nFiscal policy has remained prudent and has tightened in recent years. The overall deficit \n7. \nnarrowed significantly from over 7.0% in 2002 to 2.7% 2007 (Table A9), with the improvement \nreflected  in  the  current  balance  (i.e.,  current  expenditures  less  current  revenues).  The \nGovernment made a substantial progress in mobilizing revenue in 2007. Tax collection was up \n2.2% of GDP from 8.0% in 2006, owing to improved tax administration, increased trade volume, \nand continued strong economic growth. Indirect tax and international tax collection were up by \n0.9 and 0.7%, respectively. With routine expenditures contained, the current budget surplus was \nalso higher than budgeted (3.2% versus 1.2% budgeted), indicating prudent fiscal policy. As in \nthe  past  years,  overall deficit in  Cambodia  remains  negative  at  2.8%  of  GDP  due  to  the  large \ncapital expenditure needs (around 6.0% of GDP). The deficit is more than financed by foreign \naid,  which  tends  to  be  stable  around  4.5\u20135%  of  GDP.  Net  domestic  financing  is  generally \nnegative  and  has  tended  to  widen,  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  tighten  policies  by \nincreasing government deposits in the National Bank of Cambodia. Relative to the actual fiscal \nposition in 2007, the planned 2008 budget is slightly expansionary in that it projects an increase \nin  the  overall  budget  deficit  and  a  reduction  in  the  current  surplus.  This  arises  from  lower \nprojected  revenues  at  10.2%  of  the  GDP,  which  is  lower  than  the  actual  revenue  of  12.1%  in \n2007, and not from an expansion in spending, which is projected to remain constant at 14.2%. \nThis reflects both a conservative stance of the Government in budget preparation and weakness \nin revenue projections. \n\nFiscal Policy \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  (i) Contribution to Inflation 2005\u20132008 (%)                    (ii) International Food Inflation (%) \n\nFigure A5.1: Inflation in Cambodia \n \n\nContribution to Inflation: 2002-2008\n\nFood Housing&Utilities\n\nTransport Other\n\nInternational Food Inflation 2005-2008\n(in percent) \n\nJun-\n03\n\nDec-\n03\n\nJun-\n04\n\nDec-\n04\n\nJun-\n05\n\nDec-\n05\n\nJun-\n06\n\nDec-\n06\n\nJun-\n07\n\nDec-\n07\n\nJun-\n08\n\n   \n \n  (iii) Cambodia\u2019s GDP and Potential GDP (GDPP)     (iv) Monetary Developments 2004\u20132007 (%) \n \n\n                             (Riel billions)                     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n-10\n\nJun-05\n\nS ep-05\n\nD ec-05\n\nM ar-06\n\nJun-06\n\nS ep-06\n\nD ec-06\n\nM ar-07\n\nJun-07\n\nS ep-07\n\nD ec-07\n\nM ar-08\n\n \n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 2007\n\nGDP  GDPP \n\n      \n\n0\nDec-04 Jun-05 Dec-05 Jun-06 Dec-06 Jun-07 Dec-07\n\nExcess Reserves % Deposit\nM2 Growth (in percent) \nCredit Growth (in percent) \n\n \n\nSources:  National  Institute  of  Statistics  Cambodia.

Three  major  medium-term  issues  are  (i)  increasing  tax  revenues,  (ii) \nimproving public expenditure management, and (iii) strengthening debt management systems. \n \n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\nDec-\n-5\n02\n\n30000 \n\n25000 \n\n20000 \n\n15000 \n\n10000 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n59\n\nIssue 1: Increased Tax Revenues for Sustainable Priority Spending. Cambodia\u2019s tax \n9. \nrevenue ratio is still low compared with other countries at similar stages of development (Figure \nA5.2). Increasing fiscal revenue over the medium term will be necessary to meet the country\u2019s \nexpenditure needs. The Government\u2019s expenditure policy aims to improve public services and \nto  increase  investment.  Currently,  as  capital  expenditure  has  been  largely  financed  by \ndevelopment  partners,  domestic  revenue  will  need  to  take  a  larger  role  going  forward.  To \nimprove service delivery and to discourage corruption, the Government has also recognized the \nneed to steadily raise public sector wages, as allowed by increase revenue. \n \n10. \nIssue  2:  Improving  Governance  in  Public  Expenditure  Management.  The  2003 \nIntegrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review (IFAPER) determined that the \nfiduciary  risk  in  the  use  and  management  of  public  funds  was  high.  As  a  consequence,  the \nGovernment  developed  and  began  implementing  a  medium-term  public  financial  management \nreform  program  (PFMRP)  from  2004\u20132015,  supported  by  development  partners.  The  PFMRP \naims  to  complete  the  full  modernation  of  Cambodia\u2019s  public  financial  management  system  by \n2015  in  four  successive  stages:  (i)  ensuring  that  the  budget  is  a  credible  instrument  for \nimplementing  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy,  (ii)  introducing  effective  financial \naccountability,  (iii)  improving  the  links  of  priorities  and  service  targets  to  budget  planning  and \nimplementation,  and  (iv)  holding  budget  managers  accountable.  The  PFMRP  includes  both \ninstitutional  and  policy  reforms  to  modernize  the  public  finance  management  system  in \nCambodia.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  also  address  the  medium-term  challenges  to  improve \nrevenue collections. Significant progress has been  made in the last 2 years, including through \nthe introduction of the new chart of accounts and program budgets in priority sectors. Authorities \nhave  also  begun  to  advance  cash  management  reforms  that  should  significantly  improve \nexpenditure  efficiency.  Much  remains  to  be  done,  however,  particularly  in  rationalizing \ngovernment  bank  accounts  and  increasing  use  of  the  banking  system.  The  second  phase  is \ncommencing in 2008 with support from ADB through its proposed Public Financial Management \nfor Rural Development (PFMRD) program cluster. \n\nFigure A5.2: Tax Revenues to GDP - Regional Comparison \n\n(%)\n\n20 \n18 \n16 \n14 \n12 \n10 \n8 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n0 \n\n \n\nCambodia \n\nLao PDR \n\nViet Nam\n\nThailand\n\nIndonesia \n\nPhilippines\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nIssue  3:  Debt  Sustainability.  With  continued  fiscal  prudence  and  strong  economic \n11. \ngrowth, public debt is projected to be sustainable  over the  medium term. Public debt declined \nfrom 34% of GDP in 2006 to 27% in 2007. The continued strong economic growth anticipated in \nthe medium and long term places debt on a sustainable path. Cambodia\u2019s debt structure is not \ncomplicated. It is almost entirely external and concessional with relatively long maturities. There \nis virtually no domestic debt and no external commercial borrowing. However, moderate risks do \nremain, particularly given the current low level of government revenues, the continued existence \nof external arrears and the potential for contingent liabilities. Part of these risks will be mitigated \nif  the  recent  progress  in  revenue  collection  continues  over  the  medium  term.  On  contingent \nliabilities, currently only the minister of economy and finance can issue loan guarantees, which \nare  currently  very  small.  The  Government  will  avoid  providing  any  substantial  guarantees. \nDespite the recently acquired sovereign credit ratings as confirmation of their sound polices, the \nGovernment  does  not  intend  to  borrow  on  commercial  terms  from  capital  markets  in  the  near \nfuture.  However,  the  Government  does  anticipate  a  more  complicated  debt  structure  as  the \neconomy  develops  and  it  begins  to  source  financing  from  other  sources  beyond  overseas \ndevelopment  assistance.  ADB  has  provided  technical  assistance  to  the  Ministry  of  Economy \nand  Finance  to  develop  a  debt  management  office  and  systems.  The  proposed  PFMRD  will \nadvance this work, including producing a debt management strategy and capacity development \nof staff in the office. \n \nThe Government has outlined a medium-term strategy to support sustainable adjustment \n12. \nin  fiscal  policy  supported  by  ADB  programs,  including  the  PED  Program,  and  development \npartners: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nCompleted  the  first  phase  of  the  PFMRP  and  will  rollout  the  second  phase  in \n2008 with support from the proposed PFMRD.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government adopted the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2006\u20132010, which contains its strategies \nto reduce poverty and to achieve other Millennium Development Goals. The NSDP places private sector development \nand employment creation at the center of the Government\u2019s reform agenda, aiming to (i) strengthen the private sector \nand  attract  investment,  (ii)  promote  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  (iii)  create  jobs,  and  (iv)  enhance \nsocial safety nets. Fully aligned with the NSDP, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u20132009 [footnote 4] \nemphasizes  poverty  reduction  by  accentuating  broader-based,  private  sector-led,  inclusive  social  development,  and \nstronger governance for sustainable development. The proposed Promoting Economic Diversification Program (PED) \nwill  support  the  broad  priorities  of  the  Government\u2019s  private  sector  and  SME  development  agenda,  covering  three \nareas: (i) macroeconomic stability for  private sector  development and growth, (ii)  investment climate  and competition \npolicy,  and  (iii)  trade  policy,  capacity,  and  facilitation.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  PED  Program  will  facilitate \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  diversification  of  the  sources  of  growth  beyond  the  garment,  tourism,  and  construction \nsectors. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe impressive economic growth over the last decade has raised living standards and reduced the poverty headcount \nin  Cambodia.  Per  capita  income  has  almost  doubled  from  around  $300  in  2002  to  $600  in  2007.  With  an  increased \nliving standard, poverty incidence\u2014measured using the $2-a-day benchmark\u2014has also declined significantly from 68% \nto  51%  in  2007.  However,  Cambodia\u2019s  poverty  incidence  remains  one  of  the  highest  in  the  region,  owing  to  the \ncountry\u2019s early stage of development. Available data from survey results show that poverty incidence is more severe in \nrural  areas,  because  economic  growth  has  been  based  on  garment  exports,  tourism,  and  construction,  which  are \nprimarily  in  urban  sectors.  This  highlights  the  need  to  diversify  the  economy  beyond  these  sectors  and  to  develop \ndomestic trade and backward links to rural agriculture. \n \n\nTable A6.1: Per Capita Income and Poverty Incidence 2002\u20132007 \n\nItem \nPer Capita Income ($) \nPoverty Incidence (headcount index %) \n     $1-a day \n     $2-a day \n\n2002 \n308.4 \n \n23.7 \n68.1 \n\n2003 \n347.9 \n \n18.9 \n64.6 \n\n2004 \n390.8 \n \n19.0 \n63.9 \n\n2005 \n450.6 \n \n12.4 \n56.2 \n\n2006 \n512.2 \n \n10.6 \n53.1 \n\n2007 \n598.4 \n \n9.3 \n50.5 \n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook and World Bank East Asia Outlook April 2008  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nPrivate sector  development and growth  is crucial for sustained  poverty reduction, as it  will  be the major generator of \njobs and incomes in the future. This is particularly true in Cambodia, where almost 50% of the population is under the \n20  years  old  and  more  than  85%  of  employment  is  in  informal  activities  (mainly  subsistence  agriculture).  Removing \nregulatory  constraints  and  uncertainties  hindering  private  sector  investment  and  creating  new  businesses  is  crucial. \nRegulatory  compliance  and  transaction  costs,  which  are  more  burdensome  on  SMEs,  have  constrained  dynamic \ngrowth of SMEs by keeping most of them unregistered. The Government has made progress in the areas of business \nregistration,  trade  facilitation,  and  private  sector  access  to  finance,  but  further  reforms  in  key  areas  are  needed  to \nstrengthen the business environment. \n \nThe  staff  study  to  evaluate  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  reforms  using  a  general  equilibrium  model  for  Cambodia\u2019s \neconomy  suggests  a  significant  gain  in  the  medium  term.  The  combined  welfare  effects  of  an  average  50%  cut  in \ntransaction costs (informal) and a 50% across-the-board deduction in the effective rates of tariff are about 2.4% of the \ngross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term. The proposed reforms would also generate about 5% additional \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nemployment opportunities over the medium term. Since the gender mix of employment in Cambodia\u2019s private sector is \nrelatively balanced, the gender impacts of the reforms are expected to be balanced, with female employment rising by \n6.3%.  The  reforms  are  also  found  to  be  pro-poor.  Using  the  headcount  index,  these  combined  poverty  impacts  are \nabout a 2.7% reduction (para. 63 in main text).  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThere are no foreseen social risks associated with the PED Program. Indirect social impacts include improvements in \nthe  quality  and  quantity  of  public  services  and  governance  through  more  transparent,  predictable,  and  accountable \npublic  resource  management.  The  Program  has  been  assigned  as  a  category  C  in  terms  of  impact  on  indigenous \npeople. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAs part of the Program process, a wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society groups, and \ndevelopment partners, was consulted. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision-making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nIf  a  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n\n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues \n  \nThe PED Program has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on macroeconomic stability and trade facilitation \nto  reducing  transaction  costs.  The  improved  investment  climate  will  steadily  increase  the  number  of  SMEs  and \nemployment in the private sector. Available data from the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs suggest that the composition of \nemployment in the private sector is relatively gender balanced at 50.8% for women and 49.2% for men (Table A6.2). \nTherefore, the gender impacts of the PED Program are expected to be balanced (see para. 63 in main text). \n \n\nTable A6.2: Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Share in Types of Primary Employment \n(%) \n\n57.1 \n42.9 \n\n \nLocal \nNGO \n\n \nPrivate \nCom \n\nNon-\nfarm \nSE \n54.0 \n46.0 \n\n \n \nItem \nWomen \nMan \n\n \nFarm \nWorker \n51.6 \n48.4 \n\n \n \nOther \n50 \n50 \nNote:  SE  =  self  employed,  Com  =  company,  FG  =  foreign  government,  JV  =  joint  venture,  NGO  =  nongovernment \norganization, Ent = enterprise.  \nSource: Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs \n \n2.

The scope of the TA parallels the PED Program, covering principally the non-sanitary \nand -phytosanitary standard (SPS)-related triggers and milestones for subprogram 2.  \n \n3. \nThe  challenge  for  the  Government  is  to  accelerate  the  creation  of  productive  jobs  to \nsustain  Cambodia\u2019s  already  remarkable  reduction  in  poverty\u2014a  difficult  task  with  as  much  as \n50% of the population under the age of 20 years and over 85% of employment in the informal \nsector.  Key  to  sustaining  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  is  the  expansion  and \ndiversification  of  the  private  sector.  With  such  expansion,  Cambodia  can  benefit  from  greater \nintegration with neighboring economies, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \nand the rest of the world. Recent surveys and several value-chain studies identify weaknesses \nin Cambodia\u2019s investment climate and trade regime that are impeding the country from realizing \nits potential. These include regulatory uncertainty and excessive red tape, remaining distortions \nin \ninadequate  SPS  management  systems, \nanticompetitive and informal practices, and limited access to technology and innovations. Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  staff  estimates  suggest  that  lowering  the  transaction  costs  of  doing \nbusiness and trading by half could add $200 million to the economy over the medium term.  \n \n4. \nThe  TA  supports  a  core  element  of  the  Government\u2019s  private  sector  reform  agenda. \nUnder  the  PED  Program,  the  Government  is  committed  to  lowering  transaction  costs  and \nimproving certainty for investors. It established a sector-wide approach to mainstream trade in \neconomic policy and sketched out a medium-term strategy as articulated in its diagnostic trade \nintegration  study.  These  include  regulatory  reform,  trade  policy  reforms,  enhancing  trade \nfacilitation  through  customs  reforms,  and  strengthening  SPS  management  systems.  The \nGovernment  is  also  increasing  its  efforts  to  complete  implementation  of  its  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  accession  commitments,  which  will  influence  the  way  in  which  the \nGovernment conducts trade policy over the medium term. In this regard, MOC has established \nthe  WTO  Department  responsible  for  ensuring  consistency  between  domestic  policy  and \nobligations made under WTO accession, and notifying WTO of tariff barriers to trade and SPSs \nthat may affect trade. This TA also complements other activities of other development partners, \nincluding the Australian Agency for International Development, European Commission, German \nAgency  for  Technical  Cooperation,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations \nIndustrial  Development  Organization,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development, \nWorld  Bank,  and  World  Health  Organization.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  development \npartners in preparing the TA and will continue to do so during implementation to ensure efficient \nuse of resources.  \n \n \n\ntrade  regime,  costly \n\nfacilitation, \n\ntrade \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nB. \n\nThe Technical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe TA will support the PED Program by (i) providing the Government with assistance to \n5.  \nimplement key policy measures under the cluster; (ii) providing timely economic policy analysis \nand  advice  on  trade  policy  formulation,  trade  facilitation,  competition  policy,  and  technology \npolicy;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  deepen  the  private \nsector reform agenda.  \n \n6. \nThe  impacts  of  the  TA  are  an  improved  business  climate  that  will  reduce  business \ntransaction costs and help to expand and diversify the private sector and exports, contribute to \nhigher  economic  growth,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  poverty  targeted  under  Cambodia\u2019s \nMillennium Development Goals.   \n \n\n2. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nThe key TA activities are divided into five components: \n\n7. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nComponent  1:  Trade  and  competition  policy  capacity  development. The IA \nwill  be  MOC.  This  component  will  support  trade  policy  capacity  development  at \nMOC, including assisting in capacity development at the new WTO Department \n(e.g., developing internal procedures for notification, preparation for WTO\u2019s TPR, \ntrade  policy  analysis,  procurement  of  equipment),  developing  trade  remedies  at \nMOC,  and  supporting  development  and  adoption  of  a  competition  policy \nframework.  The  component  will \ninclude  a  series  of  case  studies  on \nanticompetitive practices in sectors believed to have them and proposing reform \nmeasures.  The  component  will  also  include  training  staff  at  MOC  and  relevant \nline  ministries  on  competition  policy  issues  and  will  oversee  the  rollout  of  the \nenterprise registry to selected provinces. \nComponent  2:  Develop  and  implement  RIA  action  plans.  The  IAs  will  be \nMOC;  MIME;  and  the  Economic,  Social  Affairs  and  Culture  Observation  Unit \n(OBSESS).  This  component  will  support  MOC  and  MIME  to  implement  action \nplans  for  regulatory  review  and  to  strengthen  OBSESS\u2019s  capacity  in  this  area. \nActivities include utilizing a management change expert to develop a suitable RIA \nimplementation  strategy,  providing  training  on  toolkits,  and  assisting  with \ndeveloping  RIA  internal  guidelines.  This  component\u2019s  activities  at  OBSESS \ninclude. staff training on RIA and toolkits and developing IT system for archiving \nlaws and regulations, ,.  \nComponent  3:  Access  to  technology.  The  IA  will  be  MIME.  This  component \nwill  assist  MIME  to  develop  a  technology  policy  framework  that  will  trigger \nimplementation of the technology matching grants project in subprogram 2. \n (iv)  Component 4: Investment incentives. The IA will be MEF. This component will \nsupport  MEF  in  enhancing  the  investment  incentives  regime  and  protection \nthrough  designing  frameworks  for  double  taxation  agreements  and  advocating \ntheir adoption as part of the Government\u2019s investment regime.  \nComponent  5:  Customs  reforms.  The  IA  will  be  the  Customs  &  Excise \nDepartment at MEF. This component will work with the department to strengthen \ncapacity of the risk management unit (e.g., provide training on risk analysis) and \nundertake a study on Cambodia\u2019s readiness to join the Kyoto Convention.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n73 \n\n3. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n8. \nThe  proposed  TA  grant  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of  $960,000,  of  which  ADB  will \nprovide $800,000. It is proposed that the TA will be financed under ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $160,000  through  counterpart  staff \nand  other  facilities.  The  TA  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  at  MOC  to  assist  with \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  reform  measures  and  activities  under  the  PED  Program \n(Table A9).  \n \n\nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \u2013 Enhancing Private Sector Competitiveness \n($\u2019000) \n\nInternational Consultants \nNational Consultants \n\nRemuneration and Per Diem \ni. \nii. \nTravel \ni. \nii. \nReport Preparation and Communications \n\nInternational  \nLocal \n\nAsian Development Bank Financing \n1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2. \n3. \n\nItem \nA.  \nConsultants \n \na. \n \n \n \n \n \nb. \n \n \n \n \n \nc. \n \nEquipment, Data, and Software a  \n \nWorkshops and In-House Training b \n \n              4.
