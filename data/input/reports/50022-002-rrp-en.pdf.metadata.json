THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nresults-based loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Affordable Rural Housing Program \n(ARHP or the \u201cprogram\u201d). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nARHP, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed ARHP will support a portion of the Government of Uzbekistan\u2019s State \nAffordable Rural Housing Program (SARHP),2 which aims to improve the quality of life in rural \nareas of Uzbekistan through rural housing construction, employment generation, and private \nsector  development.  The  ARHP  will  focus  on  rural  housing  financing  and  on  leveraging \ninstitutional  improvements  in  the  associated  sectors.3 Under  the  ARHP,  three  state-owned \nbanks will provide loans to construct at least 29,000 dwelling units in nine regions of the country. \nThe construction will be undertaken by private contractors and supervised by (i) a state-owned \nengineering company, Qishloq Qurilish Invest (QQI), (ii) the State Design Institute, Qishloq \nQurilish Loyiha, and (iii) the State Committee for Architecture and Construction.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Strategic Context \n3.  Sector strategy. The SARHP is guided by the national goal of rural development and \nimproved quality of life in rural areas.4 Although rural incomes have increased in nominal terms \n(2013\u20132015) with average annual inflation of 9.8%, especially among the poor,5 poverty rates \nremain higher in rural (17.3%) than in urban (10.6%) areas. Unemployment is a concern, given \ncontinuing  population growth,  returning migrants,  and the  agricultural sector\u2019s  limited  labor \nabsorption  capacity.6 The  SARHP  is  a  proven  government  strategy  for  generating  rural \nemployment through housing construction and public\u2013private partnerships for social and market \ninfrastructure development.7 The government provides incentives for small and medium-sized \nenterprises and promotes local manufacturing hubs for construction materials.  \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n4.  Despite high economic growth in recent years8 and reduced aggregate poverty levels, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Officially (translated from Russian) the \u201cProgram for Construction of Affordable Housing with Upgraded Standard \nDesigns in Rural Areas, 2017\u20132021.\u201d \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided program preparatory technical assistance for the Supporting \nAffordable Rural Housing Program (TA 9108-UZB). \n4  Presidential Resolution No. 1957 (17 April 2013): Accelerated Development of the Service Sphere in Rural Areas \n2013\u20132016. The state rural housing program, initiated in 2009 and authorized annually by presidential resolution, \nwas  supported  by  ADB  from  2012\u20132015  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility.  ADB.  2011.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Housing for Integrated Rural Development Investment Program. Manila.   \n5  During 2013\u20132015, average rural incomes increased by 21.8% per annum, and by 26.6% per annum in the lowest \nquintile of the household income distribution (State Committee on Statistics).  \n6  In 2014\u20132015, 330,000 migrant workers returned to Uzbekistan. ADB. 2016. Asian Development Outlook. Manila. \n7  Each 10,000 houses constructed under the state rural housing program created an estimated 150,000 jobs, \nincluding 44,600 in construction. Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Economy. 2014. Housing Sector\u2013Brief \nReport. Tashkent, p. 22. \n8  The economy grew by 8% in 2015, the ninth consecutive year of expansion at 8% or higher. ", "2 \nthe disparity between rural and urban poverty continues to widen. The agricultural sector\u2019s \nshare of gross domestic product continues to decline, which is reflected in the share of the \nworkforce employed in the sector. The situation is exacerbated by an increasing rural labor \nforce  from  new  entrants  and  returning  labor  migrants  from  the  Russian  Federation.  Rural \nhousing conditions are generally of a lower quality compared to urban accommodation. Rural \nhousing is on average smaller, older, and has more occupants due to multi-family arrangements \nin a single location. In 2014, only 50% of rural housing had direct access to potable water, 9% \nhad sanitary human waste disposal, 26% had modern heating, and 72% had access to natural \ngas.  \n \n5.  SARHP addresses these development problems in three broad ways: \n(i)  Inclusive  growth  and  rural  job  creation  centered  on  agglomeration \neconomies. The earlier rural housing clusters, built with Asian Development \nBank (ADB) support, have grown into thriving communities with local industries \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.9 Expanding  mortgage  lending  and \nother financial products into rural areas has benefitted financial sector growth \nand  small  entrepreneurs,  including  women.  Other  benefits  include  significant \nemployment generation (footnote 7) and a strengthened construction industry. \n(ii)  Affordability.  This  is  addressed  by:  (a)  introducing  smaller  and  lower-cost \ndesigns for dwelling units, including duplexes and apartments; (b) applying the \nARHP beneficiary selection criteria (para. 19[i]); (c) allowing co-borrowers, based \non the Uzbek tradition of financial burden sharing by extended families; and (d) \nbenefit transfers, whereby the government provides land at no cost, bears the \ncost of associated infrastructure, and provides income tax exemption for loan \nrepayment. These measures make the dwelling units affordable for vulnerable \nlow-income and single-parent families. \n(iii)  Improved rural well-being. The SARHP improves access to improved water \nand sanitation, provides modern cooking and heating facilities, lowers the health \nrisks faced by rural households, and brings other social benefits (para. 30), \nhelping to retain social sector professionals in rural areas. \n \n6.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $500  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance a portion of the SARHP during 2017\u20132021. The 2016\u20132018 Uzbekistan \ncountry operations business plan includes the proposed ARHP.10 Within the 2012\u20132016 country \npartnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  the  ARHP  contributes  to  industrial  and  private  sector \ndevelopment and the creation of jobs for women and men.11 \n \n7.  Housing for Integrated Rural Development Investment Program (HIRDIP). In 2009, \nthe  government  started  a  rural  housing  program  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  rural \nresidents and provide jobs. To support this program, ADB approved a multitranche financing \nfacility (MFF) in 2011.12  Under the MFF, ADB provided $500 million in financial intermediation \nloans to fund the issuance by participating commercial banks of loans to targeted creditworthy \n                                                \n9  Incentives  include  tax  exemption  privileges  for  vocational  graduates  for  the  first  6  months  of  private \nentrepreneurship. \n10 ADB. 2015.

Results-based lending. The ARHP encompasses a number of elements that cut across \nsectors, i.e. construction of new dwelling units in compliance with national quality standards; \nscreening of eligible applicants to target low-income and vulnerable families; provision and \nmanagement of mortgage financing; improved procurement systems; and effective program \nmanagement and monitoring. The need to align the incentives and ensure effective coordination \namong the multiple entities involved in the program (Appendix 4) is considered critical for \nprogram success. Results-based lending (RBL), through use of disbursement-linked indicators \n(DLIs), therefore is the most suitable lending modality for the ARHP. \n \n9.  RBL is also the best instrument for the ARHP because: (i) the government is strongly \ncommitted  to  the  program  and  has  demonstrated  the  capacity  to  plan  and  execute  large \nprograms; (ii) it incentivizes the government to ensure institutional improvements by linking \ndisbursements to a diverse set of indicators, including the achievement of gender targets, \nappropriate adaptation measures for climate change risks, the institutional strengthening of key \ngovernment  agencies,  and  the  implementation  of  improvements  in  the  government\u2019s \nprocurement procedures, as well as the completion of physical outputs; (iii) by focusing on \nachieving  results,  which  requires  greater  engagement  and  attitudinal  changes  from  all \nstakeholders, the RBL modality enhances coordination among all stakeholders; (iv) it removes \nthe need for ADB to monitor annually hundreds of small-value and small-scale transactions, \ndiscrete activities, and expenditures, which would incur extremely high transaction costs in an \ninvestment project; and (v) ADB\u2019s experience and knowledge of the rural housing sector in \nUzbekistan lays a technically sound and robust basis for the first RBL for the country. \n \n10.  The ARHP design reflects the following lessons learned in implementing the HIRDIP \nMFF:14 (i) the government has an extremely strong commitment; (ii) the demand for dwelling \nunits is high; (iii) the construction targets are met each year; (iv) the use of ADB procurement \nprocedures  increases  transaction  costs  significantly;  (v)  procurement  weaknesses  can  be \nreduced through capacity building; and (vi) the MFF modality is not suitable for construction \nperiods of less than one year. \n \n11.  Value  of  ADB  interventions.  ADB interventions will complement the government\u2019s \nefforts  and  add  value  through:  (i)  improved  sustainability  of  rural  housing  financing;  (ii) \ninstitutional strengthening of procurement systems and of government planning and monitoring \nsystems; and (iii) incorporation of climate change risk assessments into the rural housing sector \nand capacity building of regional governments on climate change risk factors and site selection. \n  \n12.  The ARHP will contribute to rural housing financing sustainability by requiring each of \nthe three banks participating in the ARHP to have a portfolio of state rural housing loans in \nwhich not more than 10% of the total principal amount of such loans is delinquent more than 90 \ndays. \n \n13.  The program will strengthen the governance, transparency, and efficiency of government \n                                                \n13 Loans of $200 million, $200 million, and $100 million were approved in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively.

For  example,  as  part  of  the \nprocurement action plan, new standard bidding documents and bid evaluation report templates \nbased  on  improved  procurement  procedures  will  be  issued.  In  addition,  an  e-procurement \nsystem for the selection of local contractors will be introduced.  \n \n14.  The program envisages improving the governance and financial management capacity \nof  the  construction  supervisor,  QQI,  by  designing  and  implementing  an  action  plan  and \nconducting  regular  audits  throughout  program  implementation.  The  audits  will  include \ninformation regarding the entire SARHP. \n \n15.  Climate change risk is not presently taken into account in selecting housing sites. As \npart of the ARHP, a government institution (Uzhydromet)15 will assess the climate change risk of \nproposed  sites  and  participate  as  a  member  of  site  selection  commissions,  with  relevant \nexpertise and support provided by ADB if required. As part of the process, potential climate \nchange adaptation measures will be identified so they can be incorporated into dwelling unit \ndesigns. \n \n16.  Alignment with  ADB  strategic  priorities. The government\u2019s strategy of expanding \nrural employment opportunities through infrastructure aligns well with the strategic priorities of \nADB for 2014\u20132020, notably inclusive economic growth through infrastructure development, \nfinancial  inclusion,  private  sector  development  through  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and \nenhanced gender equity.16 \n \nC.  Program Scope \n17.  The  ARHP  will  support  a  portion  of  the  SARHP  in  the following  regions:  Bukhara, \nFergana, Karakalpakstan, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, Namangan, Samarkand, Surkhandarya, and \nTashkent. Three banks will provide mortgage financing for the construction of dwelling units \nunder the ARHP: Ipoteka Bank, National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU), and Qishloq Qurilish Bank \n(QQB).17 The scope of the SARHP and the RBL program are summarized in Table 1. The \nARHP will exclude activities that would be classified as category A for environmental impacts or \ncategory A or B for involuntary resettlement impact under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) (SPS) and activities that would involve procurement of works, goods, and services under \ncontracts whose estimated value exceeds specified amounts.18 \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  SARHP   ARHP \nOutcome  Increased number of rural families  Increased number of rural families meeting the social \nmeeting the social equity criteria  equity criteria benefit from affordable housing \nbenefit from affordable housing  constructed in accordance with national quality \n                                                \n15 Uzhydromet is the Center of Hydrometeorological Service under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of \nUzbekistan. \n16 ADB. 2014.

Program Results \n18.  Results-based lending program impact and outcome. The impact of the ARHP is \naligned with improved quality of life in rural areas of Uzbekistan by providing affordable housing. \nThe outcome of the ARHP will be an increased number of rural families meeting the social \nequity  criteria  (para.  19[i])  benefit  from  affordable  housing  constructed  in  accordance  with \nnational quality standards. Quality housing means that the dwelling units meet government \nstandards  with  completed  infrastructure  for  associated  services,  notably  roads,  improved \nsanitation, clean piped water, electricity, and gas. \n \n19.  Program outputs. The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) includes the \nfollowing outputs:  \n(i)  Output 1. Beneficiary selection, site selection, and housing construction \nare in accordance with social equity criteria and national quality standards. \nThis output addresses social equity and transparency concerns in beneficiary \nselection. Among creditworthy applicants, priority will be given to low-income \nfamilies, families with a disabled person, single parents, those living in crowded \nhouses,  and  renters.  Periodic  audits  of  the  selection  process  will  ensure \nadherence to the criteria. Under output 1, the program will also support the \nissuance of mortgage loans, incorporation of climate change risk assessment \ninto site selection, the construction of dwelling units, quality assurance of the \nconstruction process, and coordination of onsite infrastructure and services.  \n(ii)  Output 2. Improved policies and systems for the rural housing sector. This \noutput  supports  institutional  strengthening,  enhanced  sustainability,  and \nimproved  governance.  The  program  will  work  with  the  government  and  the \nparticipating banks to enhance asset quality in bank loan portfolios and improve \nthe gender sensitivity of bank strategies and policies. Based on a procurement \nsystem assessment, the program will strengthen the governance, transparency, \n ", "6 \nand efficiency of government procurement systems for the program and the \nbroader SARHP. The governance and financial management capacity of QQI will \nbe strengthened through an action plan and regular audits.19  \n(iii)  Output 3. Strengthened program management and performance monitoring. \nThis output will strengthen the capacity and mandate of the Ministry of Economy \n(MOE)  to  track  key  performance  indicators  and  manage  and  coordinate  the \nprogram across the different entities involved. \n \n20.  Disbursement-linked indicators. The government and ADB have selected eight DLIs \nfrom  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Table  2).  Each  DLI  was  selected  to  evaluate \nachievement of a critical project element, from targeting and loan application to the eventual \noutcome. The outcome indicator (DLI 1) will track the new dwelling units built under the ARHP in \naccordance with national quality standards for rural families who meet social equity criteria.20 \nDLI 2 will monitor the issuance of mortgage loans to the targeted beneficiaries. DLI 3 will \nprovide incentives to increase the share of women home buyers over 2018\u20132021. DLI 4 will \nensure that climate change risk assessments are incorporated into site selection for the ARHP \nby supporting a government institution (Uzhydromet) to assess the proposed sites and identify \nadaptation and mitigation measures. DLI 5 contributes to rural housing financing sustainability \nby supporting bank reforms and reducing nonperforming state rural housing loans. DLI 6 will \nstrengthen governance and financial management in QQI through an action plan and regular \naudits,  which  will  also  benefit  the  broader  government  program.  DLI  7  will  improve  the \ngovernment procurement system for the SARHP and the program, through annual targets for \nstrengthening governance, transparency, and efficiency. DLI 8 will improve management and \nperformance monitoring.  \n \n21.  DLIs 4\u20138 will lead to improved quality and sustainability of rural housing construction.21 \nQuality assurance of the construction process will be tracked using government standards and \nsystems.  Indicators  linked  to  financing  for  prior  results  (FPR)  relate  to  the  improved \nprocurement procedures (FPR 1) and program planning and management (FPR 2) (Appendix 3). \n \n22.  Disbursement allocation and schedule. Financing under the loan will be disbursed \nsubject to the verification of achievement of targets for each DLI. The amount allocated to each \nDLI  (Table  2)  depends  on  its  importance.  Verification  mechanisms  and  protocols  were \nestablished according to the nature of the DLIs. The protocols allow partial disbursement for \ncertain DLIs and specify whether late or early achievement is allowed (Appendix 3). \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of Total \nAllocated  ADB \nIndicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nDLI 1.

The MOE will be the executing agency, while QQI, Ipoteka Bank, NBU, and QQB will be \nthe implementing agencies (Appendix 4). The MOE will be given the mandate to coordinate the \nARHP across different ministries and entities. As requested by the MOE, and as a condition of \nDLI 8 achievement, a dedicated management and monitoring unit (MMU) will be established \nwithin the MOE to monitor the ARHP and regularly report on the DLIs, non-DLI indicators, and \nPAP actions. Close cooperation will be maintained with the MOF, which will lead financial \nreforms,  and  the  State  Committee  for  Architecture  and  Construction,  which  will  lead \nprocurement reforms. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n29.  Program soundness, results, and efficiency. Assessments showed that the design of \nthe ARHP is sound, the program outcome is based on a robust results chain, and the DLIs mark \ncritical  points  in  the  results  chain.  The  dwelling  units  are  deemed  the  most  cost-effective \nstrategy to achieve the national priority of rural well-being and employment. The program\u2019s \ninstitutional reforms will lead to greater transparency, efficiency, and cost savings in the rural \nhousing sector. \n \n30.  Economic and social analysis. The benefits from the program at the outcome level are \nimproved well-being (increased living space, cleaner environment, and pleasure in ownership), \nand increased economic output and employment. A comparative economic analysis of the \nARHP and the SARHP concluded that an annual $100 million investment in rural housing by \nADB in the program would lead to an additional 20,718 person-years of employment per year, \nincluding 6,165 in the construction sector.24 The ARHP will have other social benefits: (i) the \nalleviation of rural housing shortages and crowding; (ii) clean piped water and toilets with septic \ntanks,25 providing health benefits by reducing disease;26 (iii) energy-efficient components in \nconstruction to alleviate the impact of temperature extremes;27 and (iv) modern heating and \ncooking facilities with natural gas, to lighten women\u2019s work burden and avoid harmful solid fuels \n                                                \n24 Program Soundness Assessment (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Nationwide, only 26% of the rural population have access to piped water.

The  government\u2019s  investment  in  the \nSARHP is less than 1.0% of gross domestic product and the high level of benefit transfers can \nbe maintained in the medium term.  \n \n31.  Gender. The ARHP is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The ARHP\u2019s annual \npublic information campaign will have a focus on women. Three of the eight DLIs have a gender \nelement. At least 25% of the mortgage loans issued under the program each year must be \nissued to women (DLI 2), and over 2018\u20132021, the average share of mortgage loans issued to \nwomen must be at least 30% (DLI 3). Banks participating in the ARHP will implement a gender \nstrategy to improve outreach to women and enhance women\u2019s role in bank management. The \nMMU will monitor the progress of the ARHP towards gender targets (DLI 8). \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n32.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  An  assessment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation \n(M&E) systems for the SARHP identified key actions to address weaknesses. The SARHP M&E \noperates through three systems: (i) the QQI system for procurement and construction; (ii) real-\ntime bank information systems for mortgage loans; and (iii) the management information system \nunder  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  to  monitor  the  entire  SARHP,  including  social  and  market \ninfrastructure. The MMU and MOE\u2019s new mandate (para. 28) will ensure effective M&E across \nthese three systems. \n \n33.  Fiduciary systems. ADB conducted financial assessments and financial management \nassessments of the implementing agencies. All four agencies have the financial capacity to \nexecute their roles in the SARHP. QQI, the main implementing agency for the ARHP, will \nensure close technical coordination; oversee site selection and procurement of construction \nmaterials and civil works; undertake effective construction supervision of dwelling units, roads, \nand  on-site  infrastructure;  and  ensure  timely  delivery  of  the  SARHP  and  the  ARHP.  The \nfinancial management action plan resulting from the assessments focuses on QQI and will \nprovide assurance to the government on the quality of QQI's expenditures. Key actions include \ndeveloping an internal audit manual, implementing a comprehensive staff training program, and \nadopting a code of ethics. The action plan will be regularly monitored and updated as required. \nExternal audits of QQI will be conducted annually (DLI 6). QQI\u2019s capacity will be strengthened to \nenable it to implement the required changes. \n \n34.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  of  the  SARHP  procurement  system  identified  risks \nlinked to transparency, capacity, and efficiency. Mitigating measures incorporated in DLI 7, and \nagreed among QQI, the MOE, and the State Committee for Architecture and Construction, \ninclude (i) an improved procurement procedure; (ii) measures to strengthen the procurement \ncapacity of the government, QQI procurement staff, and tender commission members; (iii) \ninstitutionalization  of  training  arrangements  on  procurement,  contract  management,  and \nconstruction supervision; and (iv) measures to ensure greater transparency and efficiency of the \nprocurement and contract management process, including construction materials procurement. \n \n35.   The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government \n                                                \n28 World Health Organization. 2016.

Construction of dwelling units will take place only on vacant land \nowned  by  the  government,  on  sites  selected  by  regional  commissions.  The  sites  will  be \nscreened against environmental, social, and climate change risks using a screening checklist in \nthe  ESMS  manual.31 No land  will  be  acquired  and  no  one  will  be  displaced  physically  or \neconomically in anticipation of ADB funding or during implementation. The loan is classified as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples and B for environment. QQB, \nNBU, and Ipoteka Bank will sign mortgage loans with home buyers. A program safeguard \nsystems assessment, prepared with stakeholder consultation, has identified gaps between the \nnational environmental regulatory framework and the SPS. The program safeguard action plan, \nwhich forms part of the PAP, will address these gaps. An ESMS manual has been developed to \nguide the MMU and the implementing agencies. NBU and QQB have ESMSs in place, while \nQQI and Ipoteka Bank will establish ESMSs acceptable to ADB. The attached TA will provide \ncapacity-building assistance to the MMU and the implementing agencies to ensure effective \noperations of the ESMS in compliance with the SPS. The ARHP will exclude all environment \ncategory A activities and category A and B involuntary resettlement activities. Uzbekistan has \nno indigenous peoples. \n \n37.  The ARHP will introduce climate change risk assessment in site selection. Climate \nchange risks will be assessed by Uzhydromet, which will become a member of the site selection \ncommissions. This is designed to ensure the identification and avoidance of sites that may be at \nhigh  risk  and  vulnerable  to  major  threats;  in  cases  with  no  alternatives,  climate  change \nadaptation and mitigation measures will be put in place to ensure resilience to climate change. \n \nC.
