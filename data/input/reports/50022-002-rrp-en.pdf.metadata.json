The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nARHP, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  proposed  ARHP  will  support  a  portion  of  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  State \n2. \nAffordable  Rural  Housing  Program (SARHP),2 which  aims  to  improve the quality  of  life  in rural \nareas  of  Uzbekistan  through  rural  housing  construction,  employment  generation,  and  private \nsector  development.  The  ARHP  will  focus  on  rural  housing  financing  and  on  leveraging \ninstitutional  improvements  in  the  associated  sectors. 3  Under  the  ARHP,  three  state-owned \nbanks will provide loans to construct at least 29,000 dwelling units in nine regions of the country. \nThe construction will be undertaken by private contractors and supervised by (i) a state-owned \nengineering  company,  Qishloq  Qurilish  Invest  (QQI),  (ii)  the  State  Design  Institute,  Qishloq \nQurilish Loyiha, and (iii) the State Committee for Architecture and Construction.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nStrategic Context \n\n3. \nSector  strategy.  The  SARHP  is  guided  by  the  national  goal  of rural  development  and \nimproved quality of life in rural areas.4 Although rural incomes have increased in nominal terms \n(2013\u20132015)  with  average  annual  inflation  of  9.8%,  especially  among  the  poor,5 poverty  rates \nremain higher in rural (17.3%) than in urban (10.6%) areas. Unemployment is a concern, given \ncontinuing  population  growth,  returning  migrants,  and  the  agricultural  sector\u2019s  limited  labor \nabsorption  capacity. 6  The  SARHP  is  a  proven  government  strategy  for  generating  rural \nemployment through housing construction and public\u2013private partnerships for social and market \ninfrastructure  development.7 The  government  provides  incentives  for  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises and promotes local manufacturing hubs for construction materials.  \n \nB. \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n4. \n\nDespite  high  economic  growth  in  recent  years8 and  reduced  aggregate  poverty  levels, \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Officially  (translated from  Russian)  the  \u201cProgram for  Construction of  Affordable  Housing with  Upgraded  Standard \n\nDesigns in Rural Areas, 2017\u20132021.\u201d \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  program  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Supporting \n\nAffordable Rural Housing Program (TA 9108-UZB). \n\n4  Presidential Resolution No. 1957 (17 April 2013): Accelerated Development of the Service Sphere in Rural Areas \n2013\u20132016. The state rural housing program, initiated in 2009 and authorized annually by presidential resolution, \nwas  supported  by  ADB  from  2012\u20132015  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility.  ADB.  2011.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Housing for Integrated Rural Development Investment Program. Manila.   \n\n5  During 2013\u20132015, average rural incomes increased by 21.8% per annum, and by 26.6% per annum in the lowest \n\nquintile of the household income distribution (State Committee on Statistics).  \n\n6  In 2014\u20132015, 330,000 migrant workers returned to Uzbekistan. ADB. 2016. Asian Development Outlook. Manila. \n7  Each  10,000  houses  constructed  under  the  state  rural  housing  program  created  an  estimated  150,000  jobs, \nincluding  44,600  in  construction.  Government  of  Uzbekistan,  Ministry  of  Economy.  2014.  Housing  Sector\u2013Brief \nReport. Tashkent, p. 22. \n\n8  The economy grew by 8% in 2015, the ninth consecutive year of expansion at 8% or higher. \n\n\fthe  disparity  between  rural  and  urban  poverty  continues  to  widen.  The  agricultural  sector\u2019s \nshare  of  gross  domestic  product  continues  to  decline,  which  is  reflected  in  the  share  of  the \nworkforce  employed  in  the  sector.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  an  increasing  rural  labor \nforce  from  new  entrants  and  returning  labor  migrants  from  the  Russian  Federation.  Rural \nhousing  conditions  are  generally  of  a  lower  quality  compared  to  urban  accommodation.  Rural \nhousing is on average smaller, older, and has more occupants due to multi-family arrangements \nin a single location. In 2014, only 50% of rural housing had direct access to potable water, 9% \nhad sanitary human waste disposal, 26% had modern heating, and 72% had access to natural \ngas.  \n \n5. \n\nSARHP addresses these development problems in three broad ways: \n(i) \n\nInclusive  growth  and  rural \njob  creation  centered  on  agglomeration \neconomies.  The  earlier  rural  housing  clusters,  built  with  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  support,  have  grown  into  thriving  communities  with  local  industries \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises. 9  Expanding  mortgage  lending  and \nother  financial  products  into  rural  areas  has  benefitted  financial  sector  growth \nand  small  entrepreneurs,  including  women.  Other  benefits  include  significant \nemployment generation (footnote 7) and a strengthened construction industry. \nAffordability.  This  is  addressed  by:  (a)  introducing  smaller  and  lower-cost \ndesigns  for  dwelling  units,  including  duplexes  and  apartments;  (b)  applying  the \nARHP beneficiary selection criteria (para. 19[i]); (c) allowing co-borrowers, based \non  the  Uzbek tradition  of financial  burden  sharing  by  extended families; and  (d) \nbenefit  transfers,  whereby  the  government  provides  land  at  no  cost,  bears  the \ncost  of  associated  infrastructure,  and  provides  income  tax  exemption  for  loan \nrepayment.  These  measures  make  the  dwelling  units  affordable  for  vulnerable \nlow-income and single-parent families. \nImproved  rural  well-being.  The  SARHP  improves  access  to  improved  water \nand sanitation, provides modern cooking and heating facilities, lowers the health \nrisks  faced  by  rural  households,  and  brings  other  social  benefits  (para.  30), \nhelping to retain social sector professionals in rural areas. \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n6. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  SARHP  during  2017\u20132021.  The  2016\u20132018  Uzbekistan \ncountry operations business plan includes the proposed ARHP.10 Within the 2012\u20132016 country \npartnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  the  ARHP  contributes  to  industrial  and  private  sector \ndevelopment and the creation of jobs for women and men.11 \n \n7. \nHousing for Integrated Rural Development Investment Program (HIRDIP). In 2009, \nthe  government  started  a  rural  housing  program  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  rural \nresidents  and  provide  jobs.  To  support  this  program,  ADB  approved  a  multitranche  financing \nfacility  (MFF)  in  2011.12  Under  the  MFF,  ADB  provided  $500  million  in  financial  intermediation \nloans to fund the issuance by participating commercial banks of loans to targeted creditworthy \n\n                                                 \n9  Incentives  include  tax  exemption  privileges  for  vocational  graduates  for  the  first  6  months  of  private \n\nentrepreneurship. \n\n10 ADB. 2015.

The ARHP encompasses a number of elements that cut across \nsectors,  i.e.  construction  of  new  dwelling  units  in  compliance  with  national  quality  standards; \nscreening  of  eligible  applicants  to  target  low-income  and  vulnerable  families;  provision  and \nmanagement  of  mortgage  financing;  improved  procurement  systems;  and  effective  program \nmanagement and monitoring. The need to align the incentives and ensure effective coordination \namong  the  multiple  entities  involved  in  the  program  (Appendix  4)  is  considered  critical  for \nprogram success.  Results-based  lending (RBL), through  use  of  disbursement-linked  indicators \n(DLIs), therefore is the most suitable lending modality for the ARHP. \n \n9. \nRBL  is  also  the  best  instrument  for  the  ARHP  because: (i)  the  government  is  strongly \ncommitted  to  the  program  and  has  demonstrated  the  capacity  to  plan  and  execute  large \nprograms; (ii)  it  incentivizes  the  government  to  ensure  institutional  improvements  by  linking \ndisbursements  to  a  diverse  set  of  indicators,  including  the  achievement  of  gender  targets, \nappropriate adaptation measures for climate change risks, the institutional strengthening of key \nthe  government\u2019s \ngovernment  agencies,  and \nprocurement  procedures,  as  well  as  the  completion  of  physical  outputs;  (iii)  by  focusing  on \nachieving  results,  which  requires  greater  engagement  and  attitudinal  changes  from  all \nstakeholders, the RBL modality enhances coordination among all stakeholders; (iv) it removes \nthe  need  for  ADB  to  monitor  annually  hundreds  of  small-value  and  small-scale  transactions, \ndiscrete  activities,  and  expenditures,  which  would  incur  extremely  high  transaction  costs  in  an \ninvestment  project;  and  (v)  ADB\u2019s  experience  and  knowledge  of  the  rural  housing  sector  in \nUzbekistan lays a technically sound and robust basis for the first RBL for the country. \n \n10. \nThe  ARHP  design  reflects  the  following  lessons  learned  in  implementing  the  HIRDIP \nMFF:14 (i)  the  government  has  an  extremely  strong  commitment;  (ii)  the  demand  for  dwelling \nunits  is  high;  (iii) the  construction targets  are met  each  year; (iv)  the  use  of  ADB  procurement \nprocedures  increases  transaction  costs  significantly;  (v)  procurement  weaknesses  can  be \nreduced  through  capacity  building;  and  (vi)  the  MFF  modality  is  not  suitable  for  construction \nperiods of less than one year. \n\nimplementation  of \n\nimprovements \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \nValue  of  ADB  interventions.  ADB  interventions  will  complement  the  government\u2019s \n11. \nefforts  and  add  value  through:  (i)  improved  sustainability  of  rural  housing  financing;  (ii) \ninstitutional strengthening of procurement systems and of government planning and monitoring \nsystems; and (iii) incorporation of climate change risk assessments into the rural housing sector \nand capacity building of regional governments on climate change risk factors and site selection. \n\n  \n\n12. \nThe  ARHP  will  contribute  to  rural  housing  financing  sustainability  by  requiring  each  of \nthe  three  banks  participating  in  the  ARHP  to  have  a  portfolio  of  state  rural  housing  loans  in \nwhich not more than 10% of the total principal amount of such loans is delinquent more than 90 \ndays. \n \n13. \n                                                 \n13 Loans of $200 million, $200 million, and $100 million were approved in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively.

For  example,  as  part  of  the \nprocurement action plan, new standard bidding documents and bid evaluation report templates \nbased  on  improved  procurement  procedures  will  be  issued.  In  addition,  an  e-procurement \nsystem for the selection of local contractors will be introduced.  \n \n14. \nThe  program  envisages  improving  the  governance  and  financial  management  capacity \nof  the  construction  supervisor,  QQI,  by  designing  and  implementing  an  action  plan  and \nconducting  regular  audits  throughout  program  implementation.  The  audits  will  include \ninformation regarding the entire SARHP. \n \n15. \nClimate  change  risk  is  not  presently  taken  into  account  in  selecting  housing  sites.  As \npart of the ARHP, a government institution (Uzhydromet)15 will assess the climate change risk of \nproposed  sites  and  participate  as  a  member  of  site  selection  commissions,  with  relevant \nexpertise  and  support  provided  by  ADB  if  required.  As  part  of  the  process,  potential  climate \nchange  adaptation  measures  will  be  identified  so  they  can  be  incorporated  into  dwelling  unit \ndesigns. \n \n16. \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategic  priorities.  The  government\u2019s  strategy  of  expanding \nrural  employment  opportunities  through  infrastructure  aligns  well  with  the  strategic  priorities  of \nADB  for  2014\u20132020,  notably  inclusive  economic  growth  through  infrastructure  development, \nfinancial  inclusion,  private  sector  development  through  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and \nenhanced gender equity.16 \n \nC. \n\nProgram Scope \n\n17. \nThe  ARHP  will  support  a  portion  of  the  SARHP  in  the  following  regions:  Bukhara, \nFergana, Karakalpakstan, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, Namangan, Samarkand, Surkhandarya, and \nTashkent.  Three  banks  will  provide  mortgage  financing  for  the  construction  of  dwelling  units \nunder the ARHP: Ipoteka Bank, National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU), and Qishloq Qurilish Bank \n(QQB).17 The  scope  of  the  SARHP  and  the  RBL  program  are  summarized  in  Table  1.

The  impact  of  the  ARHP  is \naligned with improved quality of life in rural areas of Uzbekistan by providing affordable housing. \nThe  outcome  of  the  ARHP  will  be  an  increased  number  of  rural  families  meeting  the  social \nequity  criteria  (para.  19[i])  benefit  from  affordable  housing  constructed  in  accordance  with \nnational  quality  standards.  Quality  housing  means  that  the  dwelling  units  meet  government \nstandards  with  completed  infrastructure  for  associated  services,  notably  roads,  improved \nsanitation, clean piped water, electricity, and gas. \n \n19. \nfollowing outputs:  \n(i) \n\nProgram  outputs.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  includes  the \n\nOutput  1.  Beneficiary  selection,  site  selection,  and  housing  construction \nare in accordance with social equity criteria and national quality standards. \nThis  output  addresses  social  equity  and  transparency  concerns  in  beneficiary \nselection.  Among  creditworthy  applicants,  priority  will  be  given  to  low-income \nfamilies, families with a disabled person, single parents, those living in crowded \nhouses,  and  renters.  Periodic  audits  of  the  selection  process  will  ensure \nadherence  to  the  criteria.  Under  output  1,  the  program  will  also  support  the \nissuance  of  mortgage  loans,  incorporation  of  climate  change  risk  assessment \ninto  site  selection,  the  construction  of  dwelling  units,  quality  assurance  of  the \nconstruction process, and coordination of onsite infrastructure and services.  \nOutput 2. Improved policies and systems for the rural housing sector. This \noutput  supports \ninstitutional  strengthening,  enhanced  sustainability,  and \nimproved  governance.  The  program  will  work  with  the  government  and  the \nparticipating banks to enhance asset quality in bank loan portfolios and improve \nthe  gender  sensitivity  of  bank  strategies  and  policies.  Based  on  a  procurement \nsystem  assessment, the  program  will  strengthen  the governance,  transparency, \n\n(ii) \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\nand  efficiency  of  government  procurement  systems  for  the  program  and  the \nbroader SARHP. The governance and financial management capacity of QQI will \nbe strengthened through an action plan and regular audits.19  \nOutput 3. Strengthened program management and performance monitoring. \nThis output will strengthen the capacity and mandate of the Ministry of Economy \n(MOE)  to  track  key  performance  indicators  and  manage  and  coordinate  the \nprogram across the different entities involved. \n\n \nDisbursement-linked  indicators.  The  government  and  ADB  have  selected  eight  DLIs \n20. \nfrom  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Table  2).  Each  DLI  was  selected  to  evaluate \nachievement  of  a  critical  project  element,  from  targeting  and  loan  application  to  the  eventual \noutcome. The outcome indicator (DLI 1) will track the new dwelling units built under the ARHP in \naccordance  with  national  quality  standards  for  rural  families  who  meet  social  equity  criteria.20 \nDLI  2  will  monitor  the  issuance  of  mortgage  loans  to  the  targeted  beneficiaries.  DLI  3  will \nprovide  incentives  to  increase  the  share  of  women  home  buyers  over  2018\u20132021.  DLI  4  will \nensure that climate change risk assessments are incorporated into site selection for the ARHP \nby supporting a government institution (Uzhydromet) to assess the proposed sites and identify \nadaptation  and mitigation  measures.  DLI  5  contributes  to rural  housing financing  sustainability \nby  supporting  bank  reforms  and  reducing  nonperforming  state  rural  housing  loans.  DLI  6  will \nstrengthen  governance  and  financial  management  in  QQI  through  an  action  plan  and  regular \naudits,  which  will  also  benefit  the  broader  government  program.  DLI  7  will  improve  the \ngovernment  procurement  system  for  the  SARHP  and  the  program,  through  annual  targets  for \nstrengthening  governance,  transparency,  and  efficiency.  DLI  8  will  improve  management  and \nperformance monitoring.  \n \nDLIs 4\u20138 will lead to improved quality and sustainability of rural housing construction.21 \n21. \nQuality assurance of the construction process will be tracked using government standards and \nsystems.  Indicators  linked  to  financing  for  prior  results  (FPR)  relate  to  the  improved \nprocurement procedures (FPR 1) and program planning and management (FPR 2) (Appendix 3). \n\n \n22. \nDisbursement  allocation  and  schedule.  Financing  under  the  loan  will  be  disbursed \nsubject to the verification of achievement of targets for each DLI. The amount allocated to each \nDLI  (Table  2)  depends  on  its  importance.  Verification  mechanisms  and  protocols  were \nestablished  according  to  the  nature  of  the  DLIs.  The  protocols  allow  partial  disbursement  for \ncertain DLIs and specify whether late or early achievement is allowed (Appendix 3). \n \n\nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \n\nDisbursement \nAllocated \n($ million) \n168.0 \n\nShare of Total \nADB \nFinancing (%) \n33.6 \n\nIndicator \nDLI 1.

Assessments showed that the design of \nthe ARHP is sound, the program outcome is based on a robust results chain, and the DLIs mark \ncritical  points  in  the  results  chain.  The  dwelling  units  are  deemed  the  most  cost-effective \nstrategy  to  achieve  the  national  priority  of  rural  well-being  and  employment.  The  program\u2019s \ninstitutional  reforms  will  lead  to  greater  transparency,  efficiency,  and  cost  savings  in  the  rural \nhousing sector. \n \n30. \nEconomic and social analysis. The benefits from the program at the outcome level are \nimproved well-being (increased living space, cleaner environment, and pleasure in ownership), \nand  increased  economic  output  and  employment.  A  comparative  economic  analysis  of  the \nARHP  and  the  SARHP  concluded  that  an  annual  $100  million  investment  in  rural  housing  by \nADB in the program would lead to an additional 20,718 person-years of employment per year, \nincluding  6,165  in  the  construction  sector.24 The  ARHP  will  have  other  social  benefits:  (i)  the \nalleviation of rural housing shortages and crowding; (ii) clean piped water and toilets with septic \ntanks, 25 providing  health  benefits  by  reducing  disease; 26 (iii)  energy-efficient  components  in \nconstruction  to  alleviate  the  impact  of  temperature  extremes;27 and  (iv)  modern  heating  and \ncooking facilities with natural gas, to lighten women\u2019s work burden and avoid harmful solid fuels \n\n                                                 \n24 Program Soundness Assessment (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Nationwide, only 26% of the rural population have access to piped water.

The  government\u2019s  investment  in  the \nSARHP is less than 1.0% of gross domestic product and the high level of benefit transfers can \nbe maintained in the medium term.  \n \n31. \nGender. The ARHP is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The ARHP\u2019s annual \npublic information campaign will have a focus on women. Three of the eight DLIs have a gender \nelement.  At  least  25%  of  the  mortgage  loans  issued  under  the  program  each  year  must  be \nissued to women (DLI 2), and over 2018\u20132021, the average share of mortgage loans issued to \nwomen must be at least 30% (DLI 3). Banks participating in the ARHP will implement a gender \nstrategy to improve outreach to women and enhance women\u2019s role in bank management. The \nMMU will monitor the progress of the ARHP towards gender targets (DLI 8). \n \nB. \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n32.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  An  assessment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation \n(M&E) systems for the SARHP identified key actions to address weaknesses. The SARHP M&E \noperates through three systems: (i) the QQI system for procurement and construction; (ii) real-\ntime bank information systems for mortgage loans; and (iii) the management information system \nunder  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  to  monitor  the  entire  SARHP,  including  social  and  market \ninfrastructure. The MMU and MOE\u2019s new mandate (para. 28) will ensure effective M&E across \nthese three systems. \n \n33. \nFiduciary  systems.  ADB  conducted  financial  assessments  and  financial  management \nassessments  of  the  implementing  agencies.  All  four  agencies  have  the  financial  capacity  to \nexecute  their  roles  in  the  SARHP.  QQI,  the  main  implementing  agency  for  the  ARHP,  will \nensure  close  technical  coordination;  oversee  site  selection  and  procurement  of  construction \nmaterials and civil works; undertake effective construction supervision of dwelling units, roads, \nand  on-site  infrastructure;  and  ensure  timely  delivery  of  the  SARHP  and  the  ARHP.  The \nfinancial  management  action  plan  resulting  from  the  assessments  focuses  on  QQI  and  will \nprovide assurance to the government on the quality of QQI's expenditures. Key actions include \ndeveloping an internal audit manual, implementing a comprehensive staff training program, and \nadopting a code of ethics. The action plan will be regularly monitored and updated as required. \nExternal audits of QQI will be conducted annually (DLI 6). QQI\u2019s capacity will be strengthened to \nenable it to implement the required changes. \n \nA  procurement  risk  assessment  of  the  SARHP  procurement  system  identified  risks \n34. \nlinked to transparency, capacity, and efficiency. Mitigating measures incorporated in DLI 7, and \nagreed  among  QQI,  the  MOE,  and  the  State  Committee  for  Architecture  and  Construction, \ninclude  (i)  an  improved  procurement  procedure;  (ii)  measures  to  strengthen  the  procurement \ncapacity  of  the  government,  QQI  procurement  staff,  and  tender  commission  members;  (iii) \ninstitutionalization  of  training  arrangements  on  procurement,  contract  management,  and \nconstruction supervision; and (iv) measures to ensure greater transparency and efficiency of the \nprocurement and contract management process, including construction materials procurement. \n \n35. \n The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government \n\n                                                 \n28 World Health Organization. 2016.

Construction of dwelling units will take place only on vacant land \nowned  by  the  government,  on  sites  selected  by  regional  commissions.  The  sites  will  be \nscreened against environmental, social, and climate change risks using a screening checklist in \nthe  ESMS  manual. 31  No  land  will  be  acquired  and  no  one  will  be  displaced  physically  or \neconomically in anticipation of ADB funding or during implementation. The loan is classified as \ncategory  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  and  B  for  environment. QQB, \nNBU,  and  Ipoteka  Bank  will  sign  mortgage  loans  with  home  buyers.  A  program  safeguard \nsystems  assessment,  prepared  with  stakeholder  consultation,  has  identified  gaps  between  the \nnational environmental regulatory framework and the SPS. The program safeguard action plan, \nwhich forms part of the PAP, will address these gaps. An ESMS manual has been developed to \nguide  the  MMU  and  the  implementing  agencies.  NBU  and  QQB  have  ESMSs  in  place,  while \nQQI  and  Ipoteka  Bank will  establish  ESMSs  acceptable  to  ADB. The  attached TA  will  provide \ncapacity-building  assistance  to  the  MMU  and  the  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  effective \noperations  of  the  ESMS  in  compliance  with  the  SPS.  The  ARHP  will  exclude  all  environment \ncategory  A  activities  and  category  A  and  B  involuntary  resettlement  activities.  Uzbekistan  has \nno indigenous peoples. \n \n37. \nThe  ARHP  will  introduce  climate  change  risk  assessment  in  site  selection.  Climate \nchange risks will be assessed by Uzhydromet, which will become a member of the site selection \ncommissions. This is designed to ensure the identification and avoidance of sites that may be at \nhigh  risk  and  vulnerable  to  major  threats;  in  cases  with  no  alternatives,  climate  change \nadaptation and mitigation measures will be put in place to ensure resilience to climate change. \n \nC. \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.  The  overall  benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n\nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nRatings  \nSubstantial \n\n \n\nRisks \nResults.

QQI\u2019s \ninternal audit is nonfunctional, and its financial \nstatements are inadequate in terms of \ntransparency, quality, and consistency. Its \nexternal audit is undertaken by a licensed local \nfirm according to national standards, which are \nnot fully aligned with International Standards on \nAuditing.  \nStaffing. QQI has no certified or qualified \naccountants among its accounting staff and no \noperational training program. It has no code of \nethics or guidance to staff on implementing \nrelevant standards. \nFiduciary (procurement). There is limited \n\nSubstantial \n\nKey Mitigating Measures \nBeneficiary selection criteria will be implemented \n(DLIs 1 and 2). A mandate will be given to the \nMOE to coordinate, with a dedicated MMU \ncharged with M&E (DLI 8). \nA plan to address these shortcomings will be \nfully implemented and monitored, including the \nstrengthening of the internal audit unit and the \nconduct of external audits by an auditor \nacceptable to ADB. \n\nHigh \n\nQQI will develop and implement enhanced \nqualification requirements for accounting staff, \nsystematic training, and a code of ethics. \n\nSubstantial  The procurement action plan (DLI 7) includes \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2013.
