I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hai River Estuary Area Pollution Control and \nEcosystem Rehabilitation Project. The report also describes the technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Development for Green Growth Demonstration, and if the Board approves the loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n2.  The project will support the Tianjin municipal government (TMG) to implement green \ngrowth demonstration activities in the coastal areas south of the Hai River estuary that will \ncontribute to a recycling economy. The project proposed for Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfinancing includes (i) wastewater management and pollution control, including the establishment \nof a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and water reuse facilities along the south bank of the \nHai River estuary; (ii) clean-up and reuse of contaminated sediment in the Hai River estuary \narea;  (iii)  ecosystem  rehabilitation  in  the  Hai  River  estuary  area;  (iv)  establishment  of  an \nenvironmental monitoring and emergency response center (EMERC) in the Harbor Economic \nArea  (HEA),  formerly  called  the  Harbor  Industrial  Park;  and  (v)  prevention  of  storm-surge \ndisasters.2  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tianjin municipality, the sixth largest city and one of four special municipalities in the \nPRC  with  a  provincial  status,  has  a  total  area  of  11,760  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  a \npopulation of 11.6 million. It is located in the lowest reach of the Hai River basin. Of the nine \nmajor rivers in the basin, seven flow through Tianjin to the Bohai Sea.3 The central government \nidentifies the Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA), established in January 2010 and administered by \nTianjin municipality, as the third economic growth focal point of the country, after Shenzhen in \nthe 1980s and the Shanghai Pudong area in the 1990s. With a planned area of 2,270 km2 and \npopulation of 1.4 million, this new development area is proposed to become a center of finance, \nbusiness, and industry in the northern PRC in the near future. TBNA contributed more than 50% \nof TMG\u2019s gross domestic product in 2009.  \n4.  The HEA, a land reclamation area in the tidal-flat portion of Bohai Bay, south of the Hai \nRiver  estuary,  is  one  of  the  functional  areas  in  TBNA.  The  development  of  this  state \ndemonstration zone for the recycling economy began in 2003 and is due to be completed by \n2018.  The  area  will  accommodate  large  domestic  and  international  companies,  including \npetrochemical  industries,  shipyards,  offshore  oil  engineering  bases,  heavy  equipment \nmanufacturing,  technological  research,  and  development  institutes;  and  will  provide  for \nresidential areas and corresponding public utilities. It will also accommodate industries that will \nbe moved from existing residential areas. The initial 2005 master plan for HEA development \ncovered three phases, with a total area of about 80 km2. Land reclamation under phase I (about \n20 km2) is complete; industries are still being established. Phase I includes the ADB-supported \nintegrated gasification combined-cycle power plant, which is more efficient than other clean coal \ntechnologies and emits less greenhouse gases and only a fraction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nPreparing  the  Hai  River  Pollution  Control  and  Ecosystem  Rehabilitation.  Manila  (TA  7312-PRC,  $700,000, \napproved on 14 July).  \n3  The Bohai Sea, also known as the Bohai Gulf, is the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea on the northeastern coast of \nthe PRC. Bohai Bay is one of three bays forming the Bohai Sea. ", "2 \noxide pollutants.4 Land reclamation under phases II and III is ongoing; about 30 km2 of the total \n60 km2 are completed. In 2010, the Tianjin Harbor Economic Area Administrative Commission \n(HEAAC) approved the revised master plan, which (i) restructures the plan for phases II and III \nareas to accommodate cleaner, nonpolluting industries; and (ii) extends the HEA to 200 km2 to \nencompass the adjacent Harbor Manufacturing Park. Future impacts of climate change on the \nHEA are of concern for TMG, which is taking measures to ensure adequate resilience.  \n5.  Rapid economic development in the Hai River basin and the Bohai Bay coastal areas of \nTianjin municipality has resulted in the degradation and scarcity of natural and environmental \nresources.  Impacts  include  (i)  highly  polluted  waterways  because  of  untreated  wastewater \ndischarges; (ii) silted canals with highly contaminated sediments, including heavy metals and \npersistent organic pollutants; and (iii) serious degradation of the Bohai Sea ecosystems. The \ngovernment has been addressing the serious water pollution problems in the Hai River basin \nand Bohai Bay by (i) promoting an integrated approach to water management in river basins \nand coastal development zones; (ii) reducing pollution sources, particularly industrial and urban \npoint sources; and (iii) continuing institutional and financial management reforms to facilitate \nsustainable  environmental  management.  Many  development  partners,  including  ADB,  the \nGlobal  Environment  Facility,  the  United  Nations,  the  World  Bank,  and  international \nnongovernment organizations, provide assistance to help control pollution in the Hai River basin. \nThese efforts have primarily focused on controlling upstream pollution sources and constructing \nWWTPs,  which  have  resulted  in  significant  improvements  for  the  urban  areas  in  Tianjin \nmunicipality.5 To  reduce  upstream  pollution, TMG  recently  developed  a  3-year  action  plan \n(2010\u20132012), which aims to (i) reduce sewage overflow to rivers in urban areas; and (ii) improve \nthe wastewater collection and treatment ratio from 82% in 2008 to 90% by 2012. The action \nplan sets a target of 30% for the water reuse ratio. Both are significantly higher than for other \ncities in the PRC. The Bohai Gulf also suffers from frequent and serious storm surges year-\nround. Storm surges have caused serious damage to Tianjin and increase the risks of pollution \naccidents. \n6.  Implementation of related ADB-financed projects demonstrates that the introduction and \nstrengthening of green growth approaches are critical for sustainable development of Tianjin\u2019s \ncoastal  areas.6 Rapid  economic  development  often  overshadows  the  need  to  integrate \nadequate environmental management practices and risk mitigation measures into development \nactivities. The project integrates the lessons and complements achievements under related \nADB-financed  projects,  including  the  Tianjin  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Water  Resources \nProtection Project, the Hebei Province Wastewater Management Project, and the Shandong Hai \nRiver Basin Pollution Control Project; and the World Bank-financed Hai Basin Integrated Water \nand Environment Management Project.7 Lessons include (i) the need to promote innovative \ntechnology  and  standards  for  project  components,  including  sound  solutions  for  sludge \ntreatment; (ii) the importance of providing realistic projections for wastewater flows; and (iii) the \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2010.

Activities are needed to (i) demonstrate practical green growth interventions that can be \neasily  replicated;  and  (ii)  strengthen  sound  environmental  management  for  the  rapidly \ndeveloping TBNA functional areas, which poses significant challenges for local governments. \nSpecific concerns include government capacity to (i) provide and protect scarce environmental \nresources, such as freshwater ecosystems; (ii) control existing and potential pollution sources \nand avoid accidents; (iii) establish adequate emergency and disaster risk management; and (iv) \nadapt to potential climate change impacts and sea-level rise. Climate change impacts have \nalready resulted in an increase in the incidence of storm surges, subsequent economic damage, \nand increased exposure to environmental accidents and disasters. \n7.  The project supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the country partnership strategy (2008\u2013\n2010) and the country operations business plan (2011\u20132013) for the PRC. It aims to promote \ninclusive growth and environmental sustainability.8 The project has a strong linkage with ADB\u2019s \nemerging  water  operational  plan,  which  focuses  on  wastewater  management  and  reuse, \npollution control, and river rehabilitation. It also supports the PRC\u2019s sustainable development \nagenda for a harmonious society, as outlined in the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u2013\n2015).9 Climate  change  and  environmental  sustainability  are  key  considerations,  including \ngreater preparedness for extreme weather events, reduction of heavy metal and wastewater \npollution, and conservation of water and natural resources.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be sustained green growth in the Bohai Bay coastal areas \nof  Tianjin  municipality.  The  outcome  will  be  innovative  environmental  and  public  safety \ninvestments demonstrated in the HEA.  \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The project comprises three outputs in the HEA: (i) water conservation and ecosystem \nrehabilitation  implemented,  (ii)  disaster  prevention  and  emergency  response  management \nestablished, and (iii) capacity development and project implementation support provided. The \noutputs will demonstrate innovative and sustainable environmental investment activities that can \nbe replicated and applied in similar coastal development areas in the PRC.  \n10.  Water  conservation  and  ecosystem  rehabilitation.  This  output  has  three \nsubcomponents:  (i)  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  reuse  to  support  TBNA\u2019s  water \nconservation target; (ii) development of a constructed wetland for secondary treatment and \nreuse of predominantly industrial wastewater; and (iii) management of contaminated sediments. \nThe wastewater collection, treatment, and reuse subcomponent includes the construction of a \n30,000-cubic meter per day (m3/day) WWTP and about 80 kilometers of sanitary sewers on \nphases II and III land available for construction by 2017. Domestic sewage and industrial \nwastewater discharges of a similar nature will be collected and treated by the newly constructed \nWWTP.10 Sludge will be reused by abstracting of protein pellets and composting. The first \nsubcomponent includes building a reverse osmosis plant that treats WWTP effluent and reuses \nwater for industrial applications. The capacity of the reverse osmosis treatment will be 15,000 \nm3/day, which will generate 10,000 m3/day of reclaimed water to be used for cooling water in the \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2008.

For  the  second  subcomponent,  a \nconstructed  wetland  will  be  built  on  about  60  hectares  with  recreational  functions.  The \nconstructed wetland will be fed with class \u2015IB\u2016 WWTP effluents and produce class \u2015IA\u2016 effluent \nfor the replenishment of water bodies in the HEA.11 The third subcomponent, management of \ncontaminated sediments, includes dredging and treating of about 1.8 million m3 of sediment \nfrom the lower section of the Dagu canal the Hai River estuary area, and associated civil works \nand landscaping for Dagu canal bank improvement. \n11.  Disaster prevention and emergency response management. This output has two \nsubcomponents: (i) storm-surge disaster reduction, and (ii) EMERC. The first subcomponent will \nconstruct a storm-surge disaster prevention wall (breakwater) to minimize potential risks and \ndamage caused by storm surges, and provide safe and efficient working conditions for the HEA \nharbor area. The prevention wall is about 3 kilometers long with a once-in-50-year design \nstandard.  The  second  subcomponent  will  establish  an  EMERC  to  target  pollutants  and \nemergencies arising in the HEA. The EMERC civil works will be designed to serve the entire \n200  km2  HEA,  and  equipment  and  facilities  installed  for  the  EMERC  during  project \nimplementation will serve the industries established in the 80 km2HEA. \n \n12.  Capacity  development  and  project implementation  support. The output has two \nsubcomponents:  (i)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (ii)  project  management  support  to  be \nprovided during project implementation. The main activities include design review, construction \nmanagement,  procurement  management,  quality  management,  information  management, \nsustainable O&M arrangement, project monitoring and reporting, and training. National and \ninternational consultants will be recruited to undertake these assignments. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $249.12 million, including contingencies ($26.53 million), \nfinancing charges ($22.21 million), and taxes and duties ($11.6 million). The investment plan is \nsummarized in Table 1. The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier \nare included in the project administration manual (PAM).12 \n14.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $100  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The PRC will be the borrower. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  year;  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  as  applicable,  to  be \ncapitalized in the loan; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. The government will make the loan proceeds \navailable to TMG. TMG, through HEAAC, will make the loan proceeds, as specified in the PAM, \navailable to the Harbor Industrial Park Construction and Development Company (HIPCDC) and \nthe Tianjin Lingang Port Group Company (TLPGC) upon terms and conditions as specified in \nthe loan and project agreements. \n \n \n                                                \n11  Class IA water quality is the current requirement for the disposal of treated wastewater.  \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Approximately 31 person-months of international consulting and 45 person-\n ", "7 \nmonths of national consulting services will be required under the loan project. HEAAC will \nengage a consulting firm with international experience using quality-based selection to provide \nservices  in  the  areas  of  design  review  and  application  of  international  best  management \npractices. \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  Technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity of HEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC \nfor applying international best practices in environmental management and establishing the \nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality management system (ISO 9000) \nand environmental management system (ISO 14001). The TA estimated at an amount not \nexceeding $1 million equivalent will be provided by ADB on a grant basis from its Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide in-kind counterpart \ncosts and services, including the remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, miscellaneous \nadministrative support, office accommodation, and local transport. The TA will be implemented \nover 3 years from 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2015. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  ADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm,  using  quality-based  selection  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime), to provide 27 person-months of international and 25 person-months of national consulting \nservices and training in the areas of quality and environmental management, and international \nbest management practices. The TA is described in detail in the PAM (footnote 12).13 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Due diligence was conducted to assess the technical feasibility and sustainability of the \nproject. The HEAAC-appointed utility company will undertake the WWTP operation, engaging \nprofessional operators for technical support and assurance.14 HEACC also assures that the \nWWTP will be expanded after project completion in line with the wastewater generation to fully \nutilize the sewers built for the phases II and III constructed area by 2015. Treated wastewater \nwill be reused as cooling water; a purchase agreement has been reached with the integrated \ngasification combined-cycle plant. International consulting services will include technical support \nto ensure enforcement of health and safety measures; and training for sediment dredging, \ndewatering, transportation, and final disposal, following international best practices. HEAAC \nalso assures that potential impacts from climate change (sea-level rise and increased incidence \nof storm surges) will be included in the final design.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The financial analysis demonstrates that HIPCDC and TLPGC, the final borrowers of the \nloan, will be able to generate sufficient revenue to repay the loan; and that in case of default, \nrepayment will be made either by TMG or TBNA, taking into account their existing and future \nfinancial capacities. The analysis also affirms that the wastewater subcomponent, the only \nrevenue-generating subcomponent of the project, is financially feasible and would remain so \neven in possible adverse scenarios. The economic analysis conducted for the subcomponents \nshows that they are all economically viable\u2014the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \n                                                \n13 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n14  HEAAC is also exploring private sector participation for the WWTP operation and is engaging the services of \noperators through a public bidding process to select the most competent contractor. The operators of the two \nindustrial WWTPs have already expressed interest in operating the plant. \n ", "8 \n12.7% for the wastewater subcomponent, 14.2% for the constructed wetland subcomponent, \nand 18.1% for the storm-surge disaster prevention subcomponent. The EMERC subcomponent \nis envisaged to generate substantial unquantifiable economic benefits, such as reduced risk of \nenvironmental  pollution  and  safety  hazards.  The  contaminated  sediment  treatment \nsubcomponent was included in the economic analysis of the whole project, although the EIRR \nof the subcomponent was not shown separately due to the unquantifiable economic benefits, \nsuch  as  health  benefits.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  project  as  a  whole  is \neconomically viable; this will not change even with a benefit decline or a capital cost increase of \nmore than 5.5%. The EIRR for the entire project is 13.4%.15 \nC.  Governance \n21.  The financial management assessment shows that HEAAC, HIPCDC, TLPGC, and the \nTMG finance bureau will be able to perform accounting and financial reporting to satisfy the \nneeds for project implementation. The offices of the finance inspector, the key project inspector, \nand the discipline supervisor within these organizations perform part of the internal auditor\u2019s \nfunction,  which  forms  the  internal  control  system.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment \nindicates that (i) TMG has successfully implemented several projects financed by international \ndevelopment institutions; (ii) TBNA established arrangements for handling the various stages of \nprocurement, including preparation of bid documents, tender invitation, bid evaluation, contract \naward, construction supervision, and contract performance monitoring in HEAAC, HIPCDC, and \nTLPGC;  and  (iii)  HIPCDC  and  TLPGC  engaged  a  professional  procurement  agency \nexperienced  in  managing  procurement  processes  financed  by  international  development \ninstitutions. However, as HEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC have not yet managed any ADB-\nfinanced projects and are unfamiliar with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural requirements, \nADB  will  provide  assistance  and  training  to  HEAAC,  HIPCDC,  and  TLPGC  in  project \nmanagement to achieve successful project implementation. \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  TMG,  including  HEAAC,  HIPCDC,  and  TLPGC.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy will be included in all documents and contracts relating to procurement and \nengagement of consultants. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 12). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The project will serve an estimated 125,000 future residents of the HEA by providing \nsafe water and greening of the residential area, such as a constructed wetland. The project will \nalso serve an estimated existing population of 300,000\u2013400,000 in the Tanggu District through \nimproved environmental services. An estimated 150,000\u2013200,000 jobs will be created through \nthe establishment of the HEA, and additional job opportunities will be created during project \nimplementation. By contributing to the clean development of the harbor industrial area, the \nproject will contribute to the creation of long-term development and labor perspectives for many \nyears. The project will promote inclusive and gender-sensitive activities during implementation, \nand inclusiveness and gender-sensitivity of the future development of the harbor industrial zone, \nand the residential area included in it. During project implementation, project activities such as \nconstruction and O&M will be guided by the HEA policy that states that about 50% of skilled and \nmanagerial positions and 40% of unskilled positions should be provided to women, and 70% of \nunskilled positions to local poor and rural migrant workers. Job opportunities will be provided \nrespecting core labor standards, and implementing agencies and contractors will be required to \n                                                \n15 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "9 \nrespect  national  regulations.  Job  opportunities  will  be  available  for  women  during  project \nimplementation as well as in O&M during operations. The influx of construction workers to the \nport area and neighboring communities demands increasing awareness of workers and the \npublic of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted disease risks. Provisions on public and worker \nsafety  and  health  are  included  in  the  environmental management  plan  (EMP),  as  well  as \nschedules for consultation and participation procedures. \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  Environmental assessment. The project classification for the environment is category \nA. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and an EMP were prepared following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EIA  is  consistent  with  the  domestic \nenvironmental assessment reports approved in November 2010 by the Tianjin environmental \nprotection and oceanic bureaus. Adequate consultations were conducted with affected persons \nand relevant stakeholders, and the EIA and EMP reports have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \nsince August 2010. The EMP includes the establishment of a grievance redress mechanism, \nwhich has been discussed and agreed with the TBNA government. TBNA, through HEAAC, will \nbe responsible for overall implementation and compliance with the EMP and monitoring plan, \nincluding inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. HEAAC \nwill have final responsibility for implementation of a grievance redress mechanism for handling \nany  disputes.  The  institutional  capacity  of  HEAAC  to  implement  the  EMP  and  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement is considered adequate. The project is \nexpected  to  achieve  significant  environmental  benefits,  including  (i)  reduced  overall  water \ndemand for the HEA; (ii) control of pollutants discharged into the Hai River estuary area;  \n(iii) improved water quality and wetland biodiversity; (iv) improved water quality of the Dagu \ncanal, and healthy and safe conditions for residents of the Hai River estuary area; (v) enhanced \nemergency preparedness and response capacity for pollution control and monitoring of the HEA \nand Hai River estuary; and (vi) a safer working environment for HEA workers.  \n25.  The  main  possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  risks  include  (i)  standard \nconstruction impacts, (ii) disposal of sludge from the WWTP, (iii) handling and management of \npolluted  sediments,  and  (iv)  potential  eutrophication  of  the  constructed  wetland  during \noperation. All impacts are expected to be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level through \neffective implementation of the EMP and monitoring program. HEAAC and the TA consultants \ninvestigated and confirmed that the contractor engaged for receiving the WWTP dewatered \nsludge has provided a viable solution. The sludge will be composted for land application after \nabstracting protein pellets. The technology has been reviewed and confirmed by the expert \npanel organized by the Tianjin government agency. The contaminated sediments will be treated \nand reused following international best practices. International consulting services will provide \nsupervision and training for sediment dredging, dewatering, transportation, and final disposal; \nand  ensure the  enforcement of  health  and  safety  measures. The  risk  of  eutrophication  is \nmitigated through the application of adequate engineering measures and hydraulic residence \ntimes, and the implementation of a comprehensive water quality monitoring program of the \ninflow water, as detailed in the EIA and EMP reports.  \n26.  Indigenous  peoples  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  classification  for \nindigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement is category C, in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. No land acquisition or involuntary resettlement will be required. The social \nsafeguard aspects of the project are covered by a due diligence exercise, which demonstrates \nthat no issues or impacts remain regarding involuntary resettlement. A sea area use certificate \nwas obtained in 2005, and compensation to the former users of the sea area for the HEA was \ncompleted in 2007. A compensation review report was prepared that (i) describes the process \n ", "10 \nand outcomes of the compensation process; and (ii) assures that no issues remain, and no \ncomplaints were registered. Being located on newly reclaimed land, no indigenous peoples are \naffected by the project.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nTechnical risk as a result of inappropriate  Adopt innovative but proven technologies and provide \ndesign  international technical assistance \nInstitutional risks caused by upstream  Secure assurance from TBNA and TMG to enhance \npollution control failures   upstream pollution control \nHEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC are unfamiliar  Provide training during project implementation \nwith ADB procedures \nFinancing risks due to late and/or insufficient  Agree on the timely provision of adequate counterpart \nallocation of counterpart financial resource.  funding from HEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC \nFragmented arrangements for operations  Secure TBNA\u2019s assumption of the oversight role to \nensure adequate coordination and supervision of \nHEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HEAAC = Harbor Economic Area Administrative Commission, HIPCDC = Harbor \nIndustrial Park Construction and Development Company, TBNA = Tianjin Binhai New Area, TLPGC = Tianjin Lingang \nPort Group Company, TMG = Tianjin municipal government. \nSource: ADB. \nV.  ASSURANCES \n28.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 12) and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n29.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Hai River Estuary \nArea  Pollution  Control  and  Ecosystem  Rehabilitation  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the loan \nand project agreements presented to the Board. \nBindu N.
