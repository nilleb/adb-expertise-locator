The  report  also  describes  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nCapacity Development for Green Growth Demonstration, and if the Board approves the loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n\nThe  project  will  support  the  Tianjin  municipal  government  (TMG)  to  implement  green \n2. \ngrowth  demonstration  activities  in  the  coastal  areas  south  of  the  Hai  River  estuary  that  will \ncontribute  to  a  recycling  economy.  The  project  proposed  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nfinancing includes (i) wastewater management and pollution control, including the establishment \nof a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and water reuse facilities along the south bank of the \nHai  River  estuary;  (ii)  clean-up  and  reuse  of  contaminated  sediment  in  the  Hai  River  estuary \narea;  (iii)  ecosystem  rehabilitation  in  the  Hai  River  estuary  area;  (iv)  establishment  of  an \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  emergency  response  center  (EMERC)  in  the  Harbor  Economic \nArea  (HEA),  formerly  called  the  Harbor  Industrial  Park;  and  (v)  prevention  of  storm-surge \ndisasters.2  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nTianjin  municipality,  the  sixth  largest  city  and  one  of  four  special  municipalities  in  the \nPRC  with  a  provincial  status,  has  a  total  area  of  11,760  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  a \npopulation  of  11.6  million.  It  is  located  in  the  lowest  reach  of  the  Hai  River  basin.  Of  the  nine \nmajor rivers in the basin, seven flow through Tianjin to the Bohai Sea.3 The central government \nidentifies the Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA), established in January 2010 and administered by \nTianjin municipality, as the third economic growth focal point of the country, after Shenzhen in \nthe 1980s and the Shanghai Pudong area in the 1990s. With a planned area of 2,270 km2 and \npopulation of 1.4 million, this new development area is proposed to become a center of finance, \nbusiness, and industry in the northern PRC in the near future. TBNA contributed more than 50% \nof TMG\u2019s gross domestic product in 2009.  \n\n4. \nThe HEA, a land reclamation area in the tidal-flat portion of Bohai Bay, south of the Hai \nRiver  estuary,  is  one  of  the  functional  areas  in  TBNA.  The  development  of  this  state \ndemonstration  zone  for  the  recycling  economy  began  in  2003  and  is  due  to  be  completed  by \n2018.  The  area  will  accommodate  large  domestic  and  international  companies,  including \npetrochemical \nindustries,  shipyards,  offshore  oil  engineering  bases,  heavy  equipment \nmanufacturing,  technological  research,  and  development  institutes;  and  will  provide  for \nresidential areas and corresponding public utilities. It will also accommodate industries that will \nbe  moved  from  existing  residential  areas.  The  initial  2005  master  plan  for  HEA  development \ncovered three phases, with a total area of about 80 km2. Land reclamation under phase I (about \n20 km2) is complete; industries are still being established. Phase I includes the ADB-supported \nintegrated gasification combined-cycle power plant, which is more efficient than other clean coal \ntechnologies and emits less greenhouse gases and only a fraction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  TA.  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for \nPreparing  the  Hai  River  Pollution  Control  and  Ecosystem  Rehabilitation.  Manila  (TA  7312-PRC,  $700,000, \napproved on 14 July).  \n\n3   The Bohai Sea, also known as the Bohai Gulf, is the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea on the northeastern coast of \n\nthe PRC. Bohai Bay is one of three bays forming the Bohai Sea. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\noxide pollutants.4 Land reclamation under phases II and III is ongoing; about 30 km2 of the total \n60  km2 are  completed.  In  2010, the Tianjin Harbor  Economic Area  Administrative  Commission \n(HEAAC) approved the revised master plan, which (i) restructures the plan for phases II and III \nareas to accommodate cleaner, nonpolluting industries; and (ii) extends the HEA to 200 km2 to \nencompass the adjacent Harbor Manufacturing Park. Future impacts of climate change on  the \nHEA are of concern for TMG, which is taking measures to ensure adequate resilience.  \n\n5. \nRapid economic development in the Hai River basin and the Bohai Bay coastal areas of \nTianjin  municipality  has  resulted  in  the  degradation  and  scarcity  of  natural  and  environmental \nresources.  Impacts  include  (i)  highly  polluted  waterways  because  of  untreated  wastewater \ndischarges;  (ii)  silted  canals  with  highly  contaminated  sediments,  including  heavy  metals  and \npersistent  organic  pollutants;  and  (iii)  serious  degradation  of  the  Bohai  Sea  ecosystems.  The \ngovernment  has  been  addressing  the  serious  water  pollution  problems  in  the  Hai  River  basin \nand  Bohai  Bay  by  (i)  promoting  an  integrated  approach  to  water  management  in  river  basins \nand coastal development zones; (ii) reducing pollution sources, particularly industrial and urban \npoint  sources;  and  (iii)  continuing  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  to  facilitate \nsustainable  environmental  management.  Many  development  partners,  including  ADB,  the \nGlobal  Environment  Facility, \ninternational \nnongovernment organizations, provide assistance to help control pollution in the Hai River basin. \nThese efforts have primarily focused on controlling upstream pollution sources and constructing \nWWTPs,  which  have  resulted  in  significant  improvements  for  the  urban  areas  in  Tianjin \nmunicipality. 5  To  reduce  upstream  pollution,  TMG  recently  developed  a  3-year  action  plan \n(2010\u20132012), which aims to (i) reduce sewage overflow to rivers in urban areas; and (ii) improve \nthe  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  ratio  from  82%  in  2008  to  90%  by  2012.  The  action \nplan  sets  a  target  of 30% for  the  water  reuse  ratio.  Both  are  significantly  higher than for  other \ncities  in  the  PRC.  The  Bohai  Gulf  also  suffers  from  frequent  and  serious  storm  surges  year-\nround. Storm surges have caused serious damage to Tianjin and increase the risks of pollution \naccidents. \n\nthe  World  Bank,  and \n\nthe  United  Nations, \n\n6. \nImplementation of related ADB-financed projects demonstrates that the introduction and \nstrengthening  of green growth approaches  are  critical for  sustainable development  of Tianjin\u2019s \ncoastal  areas. 6  Rapid  economic  development  often  overshadows  the  need  to  integrate \nadequate environmental management practices and risk mitigation measures into development \nactivities.  The  project  integrates  the  lessons  and  complements  achievements  under  related \nADB-financed  projects,  including  the  Tianjin  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Water  Resources \nProtection Project, the Hebei Province Wastewater Management Project, and the Shandong Hai \nRiver Basin Pollution Control Project; and the World Bank-financed Hai Basin Integrated Water \nand  Environment  Management  Project.7 Lessons  include  (i)  the  need  to  promote  innovative \ntechnology  and  standards  for  project  components,  including  sound  solutions  for  sludge \ntreatment; (ii) the importance of providing realistic projections for wastewater flows; and (iii) the \n                                                \n4   ADB. 2010.

Activities are needed to (i) demonstrate practical green growth interventions that can be \neasily  replicated;  and  (ii)  strengthen  sound  environmental  management  for  the  rapidly \ndeveloping  TBNA  functional  areas,  which  poses  significant  challenges  for  local  governments. \nSpecific concerns include government capacity to (i) provide and protect scarce environmental \nresources,  such  as freshwater  ecosystems;  (ii)  control  existing  and  potential  pollution  sources \nand avoid accidents; (iii) establish adequate emergency and disaster risk management; and (iv) \nadapt  to  potential  climate  change  impacts  and  sea-level  rise.  Climate  change  impacts  have \nalready resulted in an increase in the incidence of storm surges, subsequent economic damage, \nand increased exposure to environmental accidents and disasters. \n\n7. \nThe project supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the country partnership strategy (2008\u2013\n2010)  and the  country  operations  business  plan  (2011\u20132013)  for  the  PRC.  It  aims  to  promote \ninclusive growth and environmental sustainability.8 The project has a strong linkage with ADB\u2019s \nemerging  water  operational  plan,  which  focuses  on  wastewater  management  and  reuse, \npollution  control,  and  river  rehabilitation.  It  also  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  sustainable  development \nagenda  for  a  harmonious  society,  as  outlined  in  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u2013\n2015). 9  Climate  change  and  environmental  sustainability  are  key  considerations,  including \ngreater  preparedness  for  extreme  weather  events,  reduction  of  heavy  metal  and  wastewater \npollution, and conservation of water and natural resources.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe impact of the project will be sustained green growth in the Bohai Bay coastal areas \nof  Tianjin  municipality.  The  outcome  will  be  innovative  environmental  and  public  safety \ninvestments demonstrated in the HEA.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project comprises  three  outputs  in  the  HEA: (i)  water  conservation and ecosystem \n9. \nrehabilitation  implemented,  (ii)  disaster  prevention  and  emergency  response  management \nestablished,  and  (iii)  capacity  development  and  project  implementation  support  provided.  The \noutputs will demonstrate innovative and sustainable environmental investment activities that can \nbe replicated and applied in similar coastal development areas in the PRC.  \n\n10.  Water  conservation  and  ecosystem  rehabilitation.  This  output  has \nthree \nsubcomponents:  (i)  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  reuse  to  support  TBNA\u2019s  water \nconservation  target;  (ii)  development  of  a  constructed  wetland  for  secondary  treatment  and \nreuse of predominantly industrial wastewater; and (iii) management of contaminated sediments. \nThe  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  reuse  subcomponent  includes  the  construction  of  a \n30,000-cubic  meter  per  day  (m3/day)  WWTP  and  about  80  kilometers  of  sanitary  sewers  on \nphases  II  and  III  land  available  for  construction  by  2017.  Domestic  sewage  and  industrial \nwastewater discharges of a similar nature will be collected and treated by the newly constructed \nWWTP.10 Sludge  will  be  reused  by  abstracting  of  protein  pellets  and  composting.  The  first \nsubcomponent includes building a reverse osmosis plant that treats WWTP effluent and reuses \nwater  for  industrial  applications.  The  capacity  of  the  reverse  osmosis  treatment  will  be  15,000 \nm3/day, which will generate 10,000 m3/day of reclaimed water to be used for cooling water in the \n\n                                                \n8   ADB.  2008.

For  the  second  subcomponent,  a \nconstructed  wetland  will  be  built  on  about  60  hectares  with  recreational  functions.  The \nconstructed wetland will be fed with class \u2015IB\u2016 WWTP effluents and produce class \u2015IA\u2016 effluent \nfor  the  replenishment  of  water  bodies  in  the  HEA.11 The  third  subcomponent,  management  of \ncontaminated  sediments,  includes  dredging  and  treating  of  about  1.8  million  m3  of  sediment \nfrom the lower section of the Dagu canal the Hai River estuary area, and associated civil works \nand landscaping for Dagu canal bank improvement. \n\nDisaster  prevention  and  emergency  response  management.  This  output  has  two \n11. \nsubcomponents: (i) storm-surge disaster reduction, and (ii) EMERC. The first subcomponent will \nconstruct  a  storm-surge  disaster  prevention  wall  (breakwater)  to  minimize  potential  risks  and \ndamage caused by storm surges, and provide safe and efficient working conditions for the HEA \nharbor  area.  The  prevention  wall  is  about  3  kilometers  long  with  a  once-in-50-year  design \nstandard.  The  second  subcomponent  will  establish  an  EMERC  to  target  pollutants  and \nemergencies  arising  in  the  HEA.  The  EMERC  civil  works  will  be  designed  to  serve  the  entire \n200  km2  HEA,  and  equipment  and  facilities  installed  for  the  EMERC  during  project \nimplementation will serve the industries established in the 80 km2\n\n HEA. \n\n12. \nCapacity  development  and  project  implementation  support.  The  output  has  two \nsubcomponents:  (i)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (ii)  project  management  support  to  be \nprovided during project implementation. The main activities include design review, construction \nmanagement,  procurement  management,  quality  management,  information  management, \nsustainable  O&M  arrangement,  project  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  training.  National  and \ninternational consultants will be recruited to undertake these assignments. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n13. \nThe project is estimated to cost $249.12 million, including contingencies ($26.53 million), \nfinancing charges ($22.21 million), and taxes and duties ($11.6 million). The investment plan is \nsummarized  in Table  1.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier \nare included in the project administration manual (PAM).12 \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n14. \nresources  to  help finance the  project. The  PRC  will  be  the  borrower. The loan will  have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  year;  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  as  applicable,  to  be \ncapitalized  in  the  loan;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nproject  agreements. The government  has  provided  ADB  with (i) the  reasons for  its  decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds \navailable to TMG.

HEAAC  will  be  the \nexecuting agency. A project management office, established at HEAAC, will be responsible for \noverall  project  planning,  coordination,  and  supervision.  The  project  management  office  will \ninitially  have  four  permanent  full-time  staff;  this  is  considered  adequate,  as  the  project  has \nengaged  a  procurement  agency  to  handle  project  procurement.  Staffing  will  be  assessed  and \nincreased  based  on  project  implementation  needs  and  in  consultation  with  the  project \nconsultants.  HIPCDC  and  TLPGC,  state-owned  corporations  operating  under  HEAAC,  will  be \nthe  implementing  agencies.  Project  implementation  offices  have  been  established  in  HIPCDC \nand TLPGC. HIPCDC and TLPGC have established project implementation units with qualified \nstaff for all subcomponents. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 12).  \n\nAspects \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period  5 years, June  2012\u2013June 2017 \nEstimated completion \nand closing dates \n\nCompletion: 30 June 2017 \nClosing: 31 December  2017 \n\nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing \nagency  \n(iii)  Implementing \nagencies \n\nProcurement \n(indicative) \n\n(indicative) \n\nAdvance contracting \nand retroactive \nfinancing \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTianjin Binhai New Area government, responsible for ensuring coordination \namong government agencies: Tianjin environmental protection, finance, \noceanic, and water resource bureaus; and the Tianjin provincial development \nand reform commission \nTianjin HEAAC: project management office \n\nHarbor Industrial Park Construction and Development Company, and Tianjin \nLingang Port Group Company: project implementation offices and project \nimplementation units  \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \n\n5 contracts \n12 contracts \n\n$132.35 million \n$63.07 million \n\nHEAAC has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for \ncontract packages covering consulting services and civil works for constructed \nwetland and wetland water treatment. Retroactive financing can only be applied \nup to a maximum of $20 million, or 20% of the total ADB loan amount, with \nrespect to expenditures incurred before loan effectiveness, but not more than \n12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between ADB and the government. \n\nConsulting services \n\nQuality-based selection \n\n1 contract \n\n$1.0 million \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, HEAAC = Harbor Economic Area Administrative Commission. \nSource: ADB. \n\nThe  project  comprises  innovative  outputs  requiring  technical  oversight  that  is  not \n17. \navailable domestically. International best practices are to be applied for the sediment dredging, \ndisposal  and  management  of  sludge  from  the  WWTP,  and  disaster  emergency  procedures  in \nthe  estuary  area.  Approximately  31  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  45  person-\n\n\fmonths  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required  under  the  loan  project.  HEAAC  will \nengage a consulting firm with international experience using quality-based selection to provide \nservices  in  the  areas  of  design  review  and  application  of  international  best  management \npractices. \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \nTechnical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity of HEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC \nfor  applying  international  best  practices  in  environmental  management  and  establishing  the \nInternational  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  quality  management  system  (ISO  9000) \nand  environmental  management  system  (ISO  14001).  The  TA  estimated  at  an  amount  not \nexceeding  $1  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide in-kind counterpart \ncosts and services, including the remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, miscellaneous \nadministrative support, office accommodation, and local transport. The TA will be implemented \nover 3 years from 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2015. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  ADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm,  using  quality-based  selection  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime), to provide 27 person-months of international and 25 person-months of national consulting \nservices and training in the areas of quality and environmental management, and international \nbest management practices. The TA is described in detail in the PAM (footnote 12).13 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n19. \nDue diligence was conducted to assess the technical feasibility and sustainability of the \nproject.  The  HEAAC-appointed  utility  company  will  undertake  the  WWTP  operation,  engaging \nprofessional  operators  for  technical  support  and  assurance. 14 HEACC  also  assures  that  the \nWWTP will be expanded after project completion in line with the wastewater generation to fully \nutilize the sewers built for  the phases II and III constructed area  by 2015. Treated wastewater \nwill  be  reused  as  cooling  water;  a  purchase  agreement  has  been  reached  with  the  integrated \ngasification combined-cycle plant. International consulting services will include technical support \nto  ensure  enforcement  of  health  and  safety  measures;  and  training  for  sediment  dredging, \ndewatering,  transportation,  and  final  disposal,  following  international  best  practices.  HEAAC \nalso assures that potential impacts from climate change (sea-level rise and increased incidence \nof storm surges) will be included in the final design.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe financial analysis demonstrates that HIPCDC and TLPGC, the final borrowers of the \nloan,  will  be  able to generate sufficient revenue  to repay  the  loan;  and that  in case  of  default, \nrepayment  will  be  made  either  by  TMG  or  TBNA,  taking  into  account  their  existing  and future \nfinancial  capacities.  The  analysis  also  affirms  that  the  wastewater  subcomponent,  the  only \nrevenue-generating  subcomponent  of  the  project,  is  financially  feasible  and  would  remain  so \neven in possible adverse scenarios. The economic analysis conducted for the subcomponents \nshows  that  they  are  all  economically  viable\u2014the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is \n\n                                                \n13 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n14  HEAAC  is  also  exploring  private  sector  participation  for  the  WWTP  operation  and  is  engaging  the  services  of \noperators  through  a  public  bidding  process  to  select  the  most  competent  contractor.  The  operators  of  the  two \nindustrial WWTPs have already expressed interest in operating the plant. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n12.7%  for  the  wastewater  subcomponent,  14.2%  for  the  constructed  wetland  subcomponent, \nand 18.1% for the storm-surge disaster prevention subcomponent. The EMERC subcomponent \nis envisaged to generate substantial unquantifiable economic benefits, such as reduced risk of \nenvironmental  pollution  and  safety  hazards.  The  contaminated  sediment \ntreatment \nsubcomponent was included in the economic analysis of the whole project, although the EIRR \nof  the  subcomponent  was  not  shown  separately  due  to  the  unquantifiable  economic  benefits, \nsuch  as  health  benefits.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  project  as  a  whole  is \neconomically viable; this will not change even with a benefit decline or a capital cost increase of \nmore than 5.5%. The EIRR for the entire project is 13.4%.15 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe financial management assessment shows that HEAAC, HIPCDC, TLPGC, and the \n21. \nTMG  finance  bureau  will  be  able  to  perform  accounting  and  financial  reporting  to  satisfy  the \nneeds for project implementation. The offices of the finance inspector, the key project inspector, \nand  the  discipline  supervisor  within  these  organizations  perform  part  of  the  internal  auditor\u2019s \nfunction,  which  forms  the  internal  control  system.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment \nindicates that (i) TMG  has  successfully  implemented  several  projects financed  by  international \ndevelopment institutions; (ii) TBNA established arrangements for handling the various stages of \nprocurement, including preparation of bid documents, tender invitation, bid evaluation, contract \naward, construction supervision, and contract performance monitoring in HEAAC, HIPCDC, and \nTLPGC;  and  (iii)  HIPCDC  and  TLPGC  engaged  a  professional  procurement  agency \nexperienced  in  managing  procurement  processes  financed  by  international  development \ninstitutions.  However,  as  HEAAC,  HIPCDC,  and  TLPGC  have  not  yet  managed  any  ADB-\nfinanced projects and are unfamiliar with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural requirements, \nADB  will  provide  assistance  and  training  to  HEAAC,  HIPCDC,  and  TLPGC  in  project \nmanagement to achieve successful project implementation. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n22. \nwith  TMG,  including  HEAAC,  HIPCDC,  and  TLPGC.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy will be included in all documents and contracts relating to procurement and \nengagement of consultants. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 12). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  project  will  serve  an  estimated  125,000  future  residents  of  the  HEA  by  providing \n23. \nsafe water and greening of the residential area, such as a constructed wetland. The project will \nalso serve an estimated existing population of 300,000\u2013400,000 in the Tanggu District through \nimproved  environmental  services.  An  estimated 150,000\u2013200,000 jobs  will  be  created  through \nthe  establishment  of  the  HEA,  and  additional  job  opportunities  will  be  created  during  project \nimplementation.  By  contributing  to  the  clean  development  of  the  harbor  industrial  area,  the \nproject will contribute to the creation of long-term development and labor perspectives for many \nyears. The project will promote inclusive and gender-sensitive activities during implementation, \nand inclusiveness and gender-sensitivity of the future development of the harbor industrial zone, \nand the residential area included in it. During project implementation, project activities such as \nconstruction and O&M will be guided by the HEA policy that states that about 50% of skilled and \nmanagerial positions and 40% of unskilled positions should be provided to women, and 70% of \nunskilled  positions  to  local  poor  and  rural  migrant  workers.  Job  opportunities  will  be  provided \nrespecting core labor standards, and implementing agencies and contractors will be required to \n\n                                                \n15 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n\frespect  national  regulations.  Job  opportunities  will  be  available  for  women  during  project \nimplementation as well as in O&M during operations. The influx of construction workers to the \nport  area  and  neighboring  communities  demands  increasing  awareness  of  workers  and  the \npublic  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  disease  risks.  Provisions  on  public  and  worker \nsafety  and  health  are  included  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  as  well  as \nschedules for consultation and participation procedures. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n24. \nEnvironmental  assessment. The project classification for the environment is  category \nA.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report  and  an  EMP  were  prepared  following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EIA  is  consistent  with  the  domestic \nenvironmental  assessment  reports  approved  in  November  2010  by  the  Tianjin  environmental \nprotection and oceanic bureaus. Adequate consultations were conducted with affected persons \nand relevant stakeholders, and the EIA and EMP reports have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \nsince  August  2010.  The  EMP  includes  the  establishment  of  a  grievance  redress  mechanism, \nwhich has been discussed and agreed with the TBNA government. TBNA, through HEAAC, will \nbe  responsible  for  overall  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  and  monitoring  plan, \nincluding inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. HEAAC \nwill have final responsibility for implementation of a grievance redress mechanism for handling \nany  disputes.  The  institutional  capacity  of  HEAAC  to  implement  the  EMP  and  ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is  considered  adequate.  The  project  is \nexpected  to  achieve  significant  environmental  benefits,  including  (i)  reduced  overall  water \ndemand  for  the  HEA;  (ii)  control  of  pollutants  discharged  into  the  Hai  River  estuary  area;  \n(iii)  improved  water  quality  and  wetland  biodiversity;  (iv)  improved  water  quality  of  the  Dagu \ncanal, and healthy and safe conditions for residents of the Hai River estuary area; (v) enhanced \nemergency preparedness and response capacity for pollution control and monitoring of the HEA \nand Hai River estuary; and (vi) a safer working environment for HEA workers.  \n\n25. \nThe  main  possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  risks  include  (i)  standard \nconstruction impacts, (ii) disposal of sludge from the WWTP, (iii) handling and management of \npolluted  sediments,  and  (iv)  potential  eutrophication  of  the  constructed  wetland  during \noperation. All impacts are expected to be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level through \neffective implementation  of  the  EMP  and monitoring  program.  HEAAC  and  the TA  consultants \ninvestigated  and  confirmed  that  the  contractor  engaged  for  receiving  the  WWTP  dewatered \nsludge  has  provided  a  viable  solution.  The  sludge  will  be  composted  for  land  application  after \nabstracting  protein  pellets.  The  technology  has  been  reviewed  and  confirmed  by  the  expert \npanel organized by the Tianjin government agency. The contaminated sediments will be treated \nand  reused  following  international  best  practices.  International  consulting  services  will  provide \nsupervision  and  training  for  sediment  dredging,  dewatering,  transportation,  and  final  disposal; \nand  ensure  the  enforcement  of  health  and  safety  measures.  The  risk  of  eutrophication  is \nmitigated  through  the  application  of  adequate  engineering  measures  and  hydraulic  residence \ntimes,  and  the  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  water  quality  monitoring  program  of  the \ninflow water, as detailed in the EIA and EMP reports.  \n\n26. \nIndigenous  peoples  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  classification  for \nindigenous  peoples  and  involuntary  resettlement  is  category  C,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  No  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  required.  The  social \nsafeguard aspects of the project are covered by a due diligence exercise, which demonstrates \nthat no issues or impacts remain regarding involuntary resettlement. A sea area use certificate \nwas obtained in 2005, and compensation to the former users of the sea area for the HEA was \ncompleted in 2007. A compensation review report was prepared that (i) describes the process \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nand  outcomes  of  the  compensation  process;  and  (ii)  assures  that  no  issues  remain,  and  no \ncomplaints were registered. Being located on newly reclaimed land, no indigenous peoples are \naffected by the project.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.16 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n\nRisks \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTechnical risk as a result of inappropriate \ndesign \n\nAdopt innovative but proven technologies and provide \ninternational technical assistance \n\nInstitutional risks caused by upstream \npollution control failures  \n\nSecure assurance from TBNA and TMG to enhance \nupstream pollution control \n\nHEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC are unfamiliar \nwith ADB procedures \n\nProvide training during project implementation \n\nFinancing risks due to late and/or insufficient \nallocation of counterpart financial resource. \n\nAgree on the timely provision of adequate counterpart \nfunding from HEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC \n\nFragmented arrangements for operations \n\nSecure TBNA\u2019s assumption of the oversight role to \nensure adequate coordination and supervision of \nHEAAC, HIPCDC, and TLPGC \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, HEAAC = Harbor Economic Area Administrative Commission,  HIPCDC = Harbor \nIndustrial Park Construction and Development Company, TBNA = Tianjin Binhai New Area, TLPGC = Tianjin Lingang \nPort Group Company, TMG = Tianjin municipal government. \nSource: ADB. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n28. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 12) and loan documents.
