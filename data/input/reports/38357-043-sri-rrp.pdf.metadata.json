By  enhancing \nconnectivity and reducing access time for the communities served, the proposed improvement \nis critical to ensuring that the development impact of the Southern Highway is optimized and its \nbenefits reaped in a timely way. Collectively, the communities served will benefit from improved, \nlower-cost,  and  faster  transport  services  and  thereby  obtain  improved  access  to  economic \nopportunities  and  social  services.  It  will  facilitate  economic  growth  and  contribute  to  reducing \ndisparities in Sri Lanka, consistent with the government\u2019s goal of equitable economic growth.5  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe National Highways Sector Project, financed with a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, was approved on 15 December 2005, signed on 14 December 2006, \nand  declared  effective  on  20  February  2007.  The  targeted  outcome  was  improved  national \nhighway  transport  efficiency,  and  the  outputs  consisted  of  (i)  providing  policy  and  institutional \nsupport  and  (ii)  upgrading  270  km  of  core  arterial  national  highways  and  supporting  the \nimplementation  of  pilot  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  for  1,500  km  of  national \nhighways.  The  project  included  a  component  to  finance  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nexpenditure  for  80  km  of  Colombo  links  toward  implementing  later  the  civil  works,  possibly \nunder a future project. \n \n4. \nThe project experienced cost overruns during the initial stage of implementation, as the \ncost  of  civil  works  for  the  highway  upgrading  component  exceeded  the  project  appraisal \nestimate  by  128%.6 The  most  significant  cause  was  dramatic  global  price  escalation  for  key \nconstruction commodities between appraisal in 20057 and the bid preparation in 2008. To meet \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  ADB\u2019s  Road  Project  Preparatory  Facility  was  utilized  to  undertake  project  preparatory  activities,  including \npreparation of detail design and bidding documents.

Sri Lanka: State Printing Corporation. \n\n6   Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7   The appraisal of 2005 was based on feasibility estimate of late 2004. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe  cost  increase,  the  government  and  ADB  agreed  to  modify  the  scope  and  reallocate  loan \nproceeds  within  the  available  funding  envelope  toward  completing  as  much  of  the  highway \nupgrading  component  to  support  the  main  objective  of  the  project.  This  included  (i)  cancelling \nthe  component  for  financing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  along  Colombo  links8 and  (ii) \nreducing  the  pilot  performance-based  maintenance  component  to  300  km  from  the  1,500  km \noriginally  envisaged.9 Consequently,  the  highway  upgrading  component  was  optimized  to  211 \nkm of four national roads: A026 (Udatenna\u2013Mahiyangana), A005 (Nuwara Eliya\u2013Badulla), A012 \n(Puttalam\u2013Anuradhapura), and A006 (Habarana\u2013Kantale).10 \n \n5. \nOn 4 October 2010, the OPEC Fund for International Development agreed to provide $8 \nmillion, and ADB agreed to administer the loan as cofinancing11 toward improving 14 km portion \nof  A004  (Kirulapona\u2013Godagama).  This  further  lengthened  the  highway  for  the  upgrading \ncomponent under the current project to 225 km.12  \n \n6. \n \n\nOverall, the project is assessed to be performing well based on the following results: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nits \n\nDelivery  of  expected  outputs.  The  current  delivery  of  expected  outputs  is \nsatisfactory  as  (a)  policy  and  institutional  support  has  helped  the  Road \nDevelopment  Authority  (RDA)  achieve  key  objectives  of \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  framework  and  improve  its  organizational  effectiveness,  which \ninclude  reorganizing  RDA  along  core  functionalities  for  improved  efficiency, \ndeveloping  the  road  sector  master  plan,  establishing  and  operating  the \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Division,  preparing  annual  road  maintenance  plans, \nand  coordinating  RDA\u2019s  portfolio  management  with  respect  to  sector  policy \ncoordination  with  other  government  agencies  and  international  development \npartners; (b) the physical progress of the highway upgrading component is at an \nadvanced stage, with 154 km completed out of the total of 225 km (68%), and is \non track to reduce vehicle operating cost and travel time upon completion; and (c) \na  pilot-based  contract  for  108  km  is  in  progress,  and  RDA  will  consider \nexpanding the coverage subject to satisfactory performance. By these measures, \nthe  current  project  is  on  track  to  achieve  its  intended  outcome  of  improving  the \nefficiency of national highway transport. \n\nSatisfactory  implementation  progress.  The  initial  delays  affecting  detailed \ndesign  and  procurement  were  resolved  expeditiously,  and  the  four  civil  works \ncontracts  under  international  competitive bidding  were  awarded from  April  2008 \nto June 2009. Progress is on track for completion by December 2012, and there \nhas been no cost overrun thus far during construction. As of June 2011, or 88% \ninto the loan period, the cumulative contract award total was $144.4 million (96% \nof available loan proceeds) and cumulative disbursement was $88.0 million (61% \nof the cumulative contract award total). \n\n \n                                                \n8   The major change in scope and reallocation of $47.3 million of loan proceeds was approved on 1 April 2008. \n9   The major change in scope and reallocation of $5.9 million of loan proceeds was approved on 9 November 2010. \n10  The government prioritized A006 (43.54 km, Habarana\u2013Kantale) to replace A007 (44.80 km, Hatton\u2013Nuwara Eliya, \nincluded in the original project) to meet the urgent need to improve access to Eastern Province, which was affected \nby the conflict at the time. Because it was a sector loan, flexibility was available to replace some subprojects with \nothers prior to the start of the implementation (ADB. 2003. Sector Lending. Operations Manual. OM D3/OP.

Overall, the project is in compliance with specific assurances and \nenvironmental and social covenants stipulated in the loan agreement. \n\nSuccessful management of risks. Risks identified during processing are being \nmitigated or managed satisfactorily. Policy and advisory support was provided to \nassist  RDA  and  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  institutional  strengthening \nprogram.  The  Road  Maintenance  Trust  Fund  became  operational  in  2007,  and \nthe government\u2019s annual allocation for maintenance has steadily increased from \n$29.6  million  in  2006  to  $43.5  million  in  2011.13 The  World  Bank  is  currently \nproviding  assistance  with  (i)  preparing  the  amended  deed  of  trust  to  strengthen \nthe  management  and  operation  of  the  trust  fund,  including  a  technical  auditing \narrangement  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  funded  maintenance  program;  (ii) \ndeveloping  a  new  organization  structure, \ntechnical  advisory \ncommittee to advise the board of trustees on technical issues; and (iii) helping to \nestablish  a  secretariat  for  daily  financial  and  technical  operation. 14   Ultimately, \nthe  goal  is  for  the  trust  fund  to  evolve  toward  sustainable  road  financing,  with \nefficient  fund  management,  and  transparency  and  accountability  in  fund \nallocation and utilization. \n\nincluding  a \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nOn  track  rating.  The  project  is  currently  rated  on  track  in  terms  of  project \nperformance. \n\n \n7. \nThe  additional  financing  will  scale  up  the  current  project  by  further  expanding  the \nhighway upgrading component from 225 km to 287 km. It will help achieve the full extent of the \nimprovements envisaged under the original financing by covering additional geographic areas in \nWestern and Southern provinces, increasing the number of project beneficiaries, and optimizing \naccess  to  the  new  Southern  Highway.  It  supports  the  government\u2019s  priority  to  implement \nimprovements quickly  to ensure that  the  development  impact  of  the  new  Southern Highway  is \noptimized  and  its  benefits  are  reaped  in  a  timely  way.  The  project  meets  eligibility  criteria  for \nadditional financing. 15 \n \nIn  keeping  with  the  original  project,  the  targeted  outcome  of  the  additional  financing  is \n8. \nconsistent with the strategic objective set out in ADB's country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132011: \nimprove  the  transport  system  in  Sri  Lanka  and  promote  regionally  balanced  and  socially \ninclusive  economic  growth.16 The  proposed  additional  financing  is  included  in  the  Sri  Lanka \ncountry operations business plan, 2011\u20132013.17  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIn support of the country partnership strategy, the project impact will be the expansion of \n\n9. \neconomic opportunities. The outcome will be improved national transport efficiency.  \n \n\n                                                \n13  Meeting  35%  of  the  2008,  45%  of  the  2009,  and  44%  of  the  2010  combined  periodic  and  routine  maintenance \n\nrequirements projected in the 2007 National Road Master Plan. \n\n14  Advisory Services for the Road Maintenance Trust Fund Secretariat, under the Road Sector Assistance Project. \n15  ADB. 2011.

The  construction  method  will  use \nproven technology with standard materials compatible with local conditions. A road safety audit \ncarried  out  during  the  detailed  design  incorporated  findings  and  improvements  wherever \n\n\fpossible  to  optimize  horizontal  and  vertical  sign  distances,  improve  visibility  at  intersections, \nprovide  warning  signs  for  areas  subject  to  flooding,  and  install  appropriate  warning  signs  and \nmarkings to slow traffic approaching pedestrian areas, curves, and other low-speed zones. To \nenhance  resilience  to  climatic  hazards  and  disasters,  built-in  civil  engineering  measures  were \nassessed  and  applied,  including  embankment  height,  design  values  of  storm  frequency  and \nrunoff,  and  drainage.  Hydrological  considerations  were  heightened  following  consultation  with \nirrigation  and  land  reclamation  authorities.  For  project  road  B157  (a  10.84  km  section  from \nAluthgama  to  the  Southern  Highway  interchange,  which  is  located  in  a  flood-prone  area), \nconcrete pavement was adopted to provide enhanced erosion protection. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic \n\nThe economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \n17. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects. 21  The  principal  benefits  expected  are  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  costs  and  travel  time.  The  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  was  used  to \ncalculate vehicle operating costs and time costs with appropriate input parameters for Sri Lanka. \nWith the opening of the Southern Highway in 2011, a substantial increase in traffic is anticipated \non the link roads included in the project, and benefits to this traffic are included in the analysis. \nThe estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the  six additional link roads range \nfrom  14.7%  to  34.7%,  with  an  overall  EIRR  of  23.4%.  The  four  national  highway  roads  in  the \ncurrent project have EIRRs in the range of 14.1%\u201318.8%. The sensitivity analysis with adverse \nvariation  in  project  costs  and  project  benefits22 indicates  that  the  overall  project  has  an  EIRR \nabove 12% even with increased costs and reduced benefits. The EIRRs of the roads covered by \noriginal financing,  additional  financing,  and both  combined are  above 12%,  even  with adverse \nvariation  in  costs  and  benefits.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  economic  assessment,  the \nproposed  improvements  will  have  social  benefits,  such  as  improving  the  availability  of  goods \nand  services,  providing  employment  opportunities,  and  decreasing  poverty.  Therefore,  the \nproject is also justified in social cost\u2013benefit terms. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nInstitutional  capacity.  RDA  has  sufficient  capacity,  past  experience,  and  institutional \n\n18. \nPolicy  and  legal.  RDA,  the  implementing  agency,  was  established  by  the  Road \nDevelopment Authority Act in 1981. Under the Ministry of Ports and Highways (MOPH), RDA is \nresponsible for developing and maintaining the national network of class A and B trunk roads. \nRDA is headed by a chairperson who reports to the secretary of MOPH. \n \n19. \nstrength to implement the project.23 \n \n20. \nFinancial  management. Financial management assessment was updated for RDA, as \nthe  implementing  agency,  and  its  project  implementation  unit.  RDA  has  prior  and  ongoing \nexperience  with  implementing  ADB-funded  projects  and  has  satisfactory  capacity  in  terms  of \nproject  financial  accounting  and  knowledge  of  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  In  the  project \nimplementation unit for the original project, RDA has established a dedicated project accounting \nand  finance  team  with  suitably  qualified  accountants:  a  project  accountant,  an  accountant \nassistant, and four account clerks. RDA will maintain separate project records and accounts to \nidentify  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project,  ensuring  an \n\n                                                \n21  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n22 Sensitivity factors: 10% decrease in traffic and 10% increase in project cost, individually and in combination. \n23  RDA has experience implementing ADB financed road projects \u2013 8 completed and 6 ongoing. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nadequate audit trail. The  Auditor General\u2019s  Department  of  Sri  Lanka  will  annually  audit  project \naccounts  and related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  international  auditing  standards. \nTo  further  minimize  any  risks,  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for  substantial \ndisbursements for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n21. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  line  with  the \nrelevant ADB guidelines, with prior review by ADB at key steps in the procurement process. The \nBribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended), the Declaration of Asset and Liabilities Act, No. 1 of \n1975, and the Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, \nNo.  19  of  1994  provide  a  strong  legal  basis  to  deal  with  bribery  and  corruption.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment, MOPH, and RDA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  During focus group discussions held  with both \n22. \nmen and women, most respondents stated that the proposed road rehabilitation and upgrading \nwill  help  create  new  economic  and  employment  opportunities  by  improving  links  to  markets, \nproduction  centers,  and  other  areas  with  economic  opportunities.  Access  to  public  and  social \nservice  facilities  such  as  government  agencies,  health  centers,  and  schools  will  also  be \nimproved.24  \n \n23. \nGender.  Women\u2019s  regular  employment  in  the  areas  of  project  influence  is  significant. \nBetter roads will ease access to markets, health centers, schools, and workplaces and facilitate \nindustrial  development.  Gender  participation  was  ensured  during  project  planning  and  will  be \nfurther  ensured  during  implementation.  Most  of  the  resettlement  assistants  in  RDA,  who  will \nimplement resettlement plans, are women and sensitive to gender concerns. Equal benefits for \nwomen are expected to be attained under this project. Provisions in bidding documents require \ncontractors  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ \nchild labor for construction or maintenance; encourage the employment of the poor, particularly \nwomen; and do not differentiate wages between men and women, particularly for work of equal \nvalue. To ensure that these and other gender issues are addressed and complied with, the team \nof construction supervision consultants will include a social development expert. \n \nHIV/AIDS.  Sri  Lanka  continues  to  have  a  very  low  incidence  of  HIV. 25 Based  on  the \n24. \npoverty  and  social  assessment,  the  project  does  not  anticipate  any  risk  of  a  rise  in  HIV/AIDS \nincidence.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  activities  for  laborers  at  work  sites, \nwhich will be monitored by supervision consultants. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \nLand acquisition and resettlement. The project is classified category A in accordance \n25. \nwith ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009). Six  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, resettlement framework of the original project, \n\n                                                \n24  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS estimates that 3,800 people in Sri Lanka were living with HIV at \n\nthe end of 2007, for prevalence of less than 0.1%. \n\n\fthe  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1950  and  subsequent  amendments,  and  the  National  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  of  2001.  The  estimated  total  land  area  to  be  acquired  is  32.61  hectares. \nAccording to  the project census,  2,831  households will  be  physically  displaced by  losing all  or \npart  of  their  structures  and/or  residential  land,  and  the  livelihoods  of  793  households  will  be \npartly  affected.  The  total  resettlement  budget  for  the  project  is  $20.6  million.  Meaningful \nconsultation  with  project-displaced  people  regarding  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation,  and  information  disclosure  to the general  public through the  ADB  website,  was \nundertaken  during  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans.  If  any  modification  or  additional  land \nrequirement or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified during implementation, a related \nresettlement plan will be prepared or modified in accordance with the applicable laws referred to \nin  the  resettlement  plan,  and  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  will  be  obtained  before  any  further \nimplementation. \n \n26. \nImpact  on  indigenous  peoples.  As  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  found  no \nindigenous  communities  present  in  the  project  influence  area,  no  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment plan has been prepared. However, special provisions have been made under the \nresettlement framework and resettlement plans to address impacts on indigenous people. If any \nsignificant  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified,  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  will  be \nprepared and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n27. \nAs  project  roads  are  in  settled  areas  for  most  of  their  length,  with  minimal  forested  or \nnatural  habitats,  the  project  has  been  classified  category  B.  Accordingly,  a  consolidated  initial \nenvironmental  examination  report  with road-specific  environmental management  plans  (EMPs) \nand  environmental  monitoring  plans  (EMoPs)  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). All impacts can be managed by adopting suitable mitigation \nmeasures  described  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  road-specific  EMPs  and \nmonitored through the EMoPs. EMPs and EMoPs for the construction stage will be incorporated \nin bidding documents and included in contract documents. Anticipated impacts under the project \nare  those  typical  of  road  construction  such  as  the  generation  of  dust,  noise,  and  construction \nwaste;  the  temporary  disruption  of  traffic  and  access  to  living  areas  in  and  around  the  work \nareas; and soil erosion from exposed surfaces. The project envisages using borrow and quarry \nsites  already  in  operation;  if  any  new  sites  are  to  be  opened,  the  implementing  agency  will \nensure that measures described in the EMPs are adopted during site selection and closure, and \nthat  approvals  are  obtained  from  the  authorities.  Local  communities  and  other  stakeholders \nwere  consulted  during  project  preparation,  and  consultations  will  continue  throughout \nimplementation as required. \n \n28. \nRDA  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  EMPs  and  EMoPs  are  implemented.  The \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Division  (ESD)  under  RDA  will  monitor  contractors\u2019  environmental \ncompliance on behalf of RDA. ESD, which was established through ADB technical assistance,26 \nhas  been  provided  with  the  necessary  training  and  is  well  experienced  with  ADB's  safeguard \nrequirements. However, as ESD is also responsible for managing safeguard activities for other \nongoing projects under RDA, additional support for regular site monitoring and reporting will be \nprovided by the supervision consultant\u2019s team, which includes an environmental specialist. Any \nupdates  to  EMPs,  if  required,  will  be  made  by  the  environmental  specialist  consultant  and \nreviewed and approved by ESD. Annual environmental monitoring reports will be prepared and \n\n                                                \n26  ADB.  2005.

An initial coordination-cum-training \nworkshop for supervision consultants will be organized by ESD before the start of construction \nto  agree  on  modalities  for  implementing  the  EMPs  and  EMoPs  and  carrying  out  necessary \nmonitoring and reporting. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe key risks include counterpart funding and implementation delay. To mitigate counter \n29. \nfunding  delay,  ADB\u2019s  financing  includes  taxes  and  duties  related  to  civil  works  which  will  help \nease  the  government\u2019s  financial  burden  of  land  acquisition.  To  mitigate  implementation  delay, \ndetail  design  and  bidding  documents  have  been  prepared  in  advance  with  the  objective  of \nawarding  the  first  contract  shortly  upon  loan  effectiveness  (footnote  2).  The  overall  risk \nassessment  is  medium  without  mitigation  and  low  with  mitigation.  Integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30. \nThe government, MOPH, and RDA have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government, MOPH, and RDA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n32. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$85,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the \nNational  Highways  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \nand project agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                \n27  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 July 2011 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Current Project) \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Overall Project) \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n(Current Project) \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n(Overall Project) \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n(Overall Project) \n\n \nDepartment of \nCensus and \nStatistics, Ministry of \nFinance and \nPlanning \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n(Overall Project) \n\nAssumption \nGovernment \nimplementing \ncomplementary \ninvestments to \nimprove the \ntransport network \n\nImpact \nExpansion of \neconomic \nopportunities \n \n\n \nExpansion of \neconomic \nopportunities and \nbalanced growth \n \n\n \nBy 2016:  \nPoverty headcount index of the \ncombined project influence \nareas (the districts of Badulla, \nKandy, Nuwara Eliya, \nKurunegala, Puttalam, \nAnuradhapura, and \nPolonnaruwa) decreases to \n12.0%  \n(2006 baseline: 18.4%) \n\n \nUnchanged \n\nOutcome \nImprovement of \nnational highway \ntransport \nefficiency \n\n \nBy completion in 2013:  \nCombined travel time on \nproject roads A026, A005, \nA012, and A006 reduced to \n4 hours  \n(2006 baseline: 6 hours). \n\n \nRoad Development \nAuthority \n\nAssumption \nGovernment \nimplements land \nacquisition in \ntimely manner \n\n \nBy 2018: \nPoverty headcount index \nof the combined project \ninfluence areas (the \ndistricts of Badulla, \nKandy, Nuwara Eliya, \nKurunegala, Puttalam, \nAnuradhapura, and \nPolonnaruwa covered by \noriginal loan, and the \ndistricts of Colombo, \nKalutara, Galle, and \nMatara covered by \nadditional loan) \ndecreases to 9.0%  \n(2006 baseline: 14.7%) \n\n \nBy completion in 2015: \ncombined travel time on \nproject roads A026, \nA005, A012, and A006 \nplus A024, B153, B157, \nB207, A004, and B084 \nreduced to 6 hours  \n(2006 baseline: \n10 hours).  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Current Project) \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Overall Project) \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n(Current Project) \n\n \n1.
