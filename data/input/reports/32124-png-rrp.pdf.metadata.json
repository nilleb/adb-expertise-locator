Environmental assessment was undertaken for all 11 \nproposed  road  sections,  and  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination is provided in Appendix 10. \n \nThe  supplementary  financial  assistance  will  finance  additional \nroad upgrading and rehabilitation subprojects with a length of 270 \nkilometers  (km)  in  the  five  Highlands  provinces  and  related \nconsulting  services  for  project  implementation  and  training, \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \nJustifying  the  supplementary  financial  assistance  are  four  main \npoints \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe proceeds of Road Maintenance and Upgrading \n(Sector)  Project  (Loan  1709-PNG)  have  been  fully \ncommitted  and  are  able  to  finance  only  50.4%  of \nthe  total  length  of  roads  targeted  in  the  original \nproject scope. The additional proposed subprojects \nto  be \nfinancial \nfinanced  by  supplementary \nassistance  will  enable  achievement  of  91%  of  the \noriginally targeted road length. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  financial  assistance \nis  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  development \nstrategy,  which  continues  to  emphasize  improving \ntransport infrastructure. \nSupplementary  financing  is  consistent  with  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy \nfor Papua New Guinea (PNG). \nfinancial  assistance  will  save \nSupplementary \nsubstantial  project  start-up  cost  and  is  the  most \nefficient  and  effective  way \nroad \ninfrastructure in the Highlands. \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\n \nUsing  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  financing  is  justified  by \nADB\u2019s  country  classification  and  PNG\u2019s  social  and  economic \nstatus.  PNG  is  an  ADB  category  B2  country  whose  limited  debt \nrepayment capacity entitles it to limited ADF financing.  \n \nA recent assessment found that the incidence of poverty in PNG \nincreased from  37.5%  of  the  population  in  1996  to  54% in 2003. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Highlands  are  home  to  the  highest  proportion  of  the  poor. \nThe  region  is  mountainous  and  geologically  unstable,  with \ntorrential rains that can last 6 or 7 months. Road construction and \nmaintenance are costly, requiring concessional funding. \n \nThe proposed road subprojects for supplementary financing are in \nline  with  the  impact  and  outcome  of  the  Project  as  approved  by \nADB.  It  aims  to  scale  up  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  PNG  economic \ndevelopment  and  social  integration  by  financing  more  road \nsections to (i) improve road access for the private businesses and \ncommunities,  (ii)  reduce  their  travel  costs  and  time  to  major \ncommercial  and  service  centers,  and  (iii)  enable  them  to  tap \neconomic  and  social  opportunities  in  the  Highlands.  It  will \nincome \n(i)  export-led  economic  growth, \ncontribute \ngeneration  for  local  communities,  and  (iii)  poverty  reduction.  The \noutcome will be improved rural access to market centers.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  proposed  road  subprojects,  including  civil \nworks,  consulting  services,  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  other  financial  charges,  is \nestimated at $78.07 million equivalent. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  blend  of  two \nloans  for  a  total  of  $53  million,  consisting  of  $35  million  from \nordinary capital resources (OCR) and $18 million from ADF. ADB \nwill  finance  68%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  additional  road \nsubprojects,  and  the  Government  will  provide  $25.07  million \nequivalent to cover the remaining cost. \n \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\nFinancing Plan\n($ million) \n\nTotal \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n   OCR \n   ADF \nGovernment \nTotal \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary \ncapital resources. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n35.00 \n18.00 \n25.07 \n78.07 \n\nPercent \n \n45 \n23 \n32 \n   100 \n\n \nLoan Amounts and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n\n \nThe two loans totaling $53 million consist of an OCR loan of $35 \nmillion and an ADF loan of $18 million. The OCR loan will carry a \nterm of 24 years, with a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, and a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum. The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter, \nand equal amortization.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2010  \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n31 December 2009 \n \nThe  Department  of  Works  (DOW)  will  continue  as  the  Executing \nAgency,  and  the  Highlands  Region  Maintenance  Group  (HRMG) \nas  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU).  The  project  steering \ncommittee  will  continue  to  ensure  close  interagency  coordination \nand monitor project implementation.   \n \nProcurement  of  civil  works  under  supplementary  financing  will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  will  be \ndivided into 16 contract packages, five of them procured under \nforeign \nnational  competitive  bidding  without  excluding \ncontractors  and \njoint  ventures,  and  11  procured  under \ninternational competitive bidding. \n \nInternational  consultants  will  be  recruited  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  to  assist  in  (i)  detailed \nengineering design; (ii) preconstruction activities; (iii) construction \nsupervision;  (iv)  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation; \nand (v) training on road maintenance, road safety, and prevention \nof HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The \nGovernment will recruit and finance local consultants for (i) project \ndesign; (ii) construction supervision; (iii) financial auditing; and (iv) \ntraining  on  road  maintenance,  road  safety,  and  STI/HIV/AIDS \nprevention. \n \nThe  proposed  subprojects \nfinancing  will \ngenerate  substantial  economic  benefits.  Using  a  12%  discount \nrate,  the  net  present  value  is  $56.89  million,  and  the  economic \nrate  of  return  is  18.8%.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  feeder \nroads  servicing  a  population  of  about  600,000.  They  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  alleviation  in  the  Highlands  by  (i) providing \njob opportunities, (ii) increasing farmers\u2019 income from cash crops, \nand  (iii)  facilitating  access  to  social  services.  It  is  estimated  that \n1,500 local employment opportunities will be directly generated by \nimplementing  the  proposed  subprojects,  and  an  additional  6,000 \njob  opportunities  will  be  created \nthe  maintenance \nprogram for the roads completed under the Project. \n \nThe  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  are  subject  to \nthe  usual  risks  for  road  sector  projects,  including  project  start-up \ndelay, \nand \nSTI/HIV/AIDS  exposure.  The  design  of  the  Project  takes  into \nincludes  mitigating  measures.  To \naccount \nminimize  project  start-up  delay,  all  11  road  subprojects  have \nalready  been  screened,  and  due  diligence  has  been  completed. \nThe  existing  implementation  arrangement,  including  consulting \nservices  for  project  implementation,  will  be  maintained  to  ensure \ncontinuity  and  avoid  disruption.  Procurement  of  civil  works  will \nfollow  a  single-stage  one-evelope  bidding  procedure  with  post-\nqualification  to  expedite  the  process.

An  assurance  is  included  to  ensure  that  the \nGovernment will maintain the completed road sections funded by \nthe  Project.  Environmental  impacts  during  construction  will  be \nmitigated \nenvironmental \nmanagement and monitoring plans. The monitoring results will be \nreflected in the project progress reports. The STI/HIV/AIDS impact \nwill  be  mitigated  by  incorporating  appropriate  conditions  in  civil \nworks  contracts  that  require  contractors  to  adopt  preventive \nmeasures,  supplemented  by  training  and  awareness  campaigns \nfinanced  by  the  Project.  Prevention  activities  undertaken  under \neach  road  section  will  be  monitored  and  reflected  in  the  project \nprogress reports to be submitted to the National AIDS Council and \nthe Country

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nsupplementary  loans  to  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for  the  Road  Maintenance  and  Upgrading \n(Sector) Project (the Project).1 \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale  \n\n2. \nAn Asian Development Bank (ADB) report and recommendation of the President (RRP) to \nthe Board of Directors, approved in November 19992, provided a description and rationale for the \nProject.  From  independence  to  the  early  1990s,  PNG\u2019s  economy  was  driven  by  exports.  The \nprimary production area was the Highlands, comprising the provinces of Eastern Highlands, Enga, \nChimbu,  Southern  Highlands,  and  Western  Highlands.  The  region  was  geographically  and \nculturally diverse, with a population of about 2 million, almost half of PNG\u2019s total. In spite of the rich \nnatural  resources,  the  region\u2019s  population  was  predominantly  poor,  living  by  subsistence  farming \nand  other  basic  livelihoods  and  characterized  by  the  poorest  health,  education,  and  social \nindicators in the country.  \n \nThe transport system of PNG was multimodal, comprising about 27,000 kilometers (km) of \n3. \nroads;  22  ports;  countless  wharves,  jetties,  and  landings;  46  airports;  and  hundreds  of  airstrips. \nThe  road  system  in  the  Highlands  region  consisting  of  600  kilometer  (km)  Highlands  Highway \nlinking  the  five  provinces,  and  feeder  roads  of  about  2,000  km,  constituted  the  backbone  of  the \nHighlands  and  the  country\u2019s  economy.  Road  conditions  were  generally  poor  due  to  low  design \nstandards  and  lack  of  maintenance.  Almost  all  unpaved  roads  had  rough  riding  surfaces,  with \nconditions  ranging  from  rough  and  stony  to  impassable.  Much  of  the  paved  road  network  was \npotholed,  and  in  some  areas  the  road  course  had  reverted  to  gravel.  Vehicles  had  very  high \noperating costs and lasted only 2\u20134 years. Travel distances were extensive, and travel times were \nlong. As a result, local communities (about 1 million people in this region lived within a day\u2019s walk \nof  a  road)  became  increasingly  isolated.  Significant  export  and  business  opportunities  were  lost. \nThis situation led to increased social unrest and deteriorating peace and security conditions. \n \n4. \nThe Government realized that poor road infrastructure was a major constraint to economic \ngrowth  and  social  development  in  PNG  and  identified  the  maintenance  of  the  road  network  as  a \ndevelopment priority. The national transport infrastructure plan (1992) aimed to provide (i) access \nto markets for farmers and mineral and industrial producers at lower transport costs, and (ii) access \nfor  communities  to  basic  social  services,  including  health,  education,  and  government  services. \nThe  Blueprint  on  Capital  Works  1994\u20132003  of  the  Department  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation \nprovided  an  infrastructure  investment  plan  and  the  national  road  restoration  and  construction \nprogram. The program targeted upgrading 935 km of roads and rehabilitating 776 km to (i) promote \nexports  and  agricultural  production,  (ii)  improve  social  service  delivery,  and  (iii)  generate \nemployment opportunities. \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  PNG  at  that  time  focused  on  improving  (i)  governance;  (ii) \nprivate sector development, factor productivity, and market access through selected infrastructure \ninvestments;  and  (iii)  social  indicators.  In  the  roads  sector,  ADB  strategy  was  to  establish  a \n                                                 \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  1999.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  Papua \nNew    Guinea  for  the  Road  Maintenance  and  Upgrading  (Sector  )Project.  Manila.  (Loan  1709-PNG,  approved  on  16 \nNovember). \n\n\f 2 \n\ntradition  of  good  maintenance,  an  autonomous  road  authority,  and  a  road  trust  fund  to  improve \nsector  performance  and  secure  long-term  financial  sustainability.  In  line  with  this  strategy,  and \nfollowing  a  sector-wide  approach,  the  Project  was  designed  to  improve  road  infrastructure  in  the \nHighlands. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n6. \nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  as  described  in  the  RRP  were  to  contribute  to  economic \ngrowth  through  increased  exports  and  integrate  the  Highlands\u2019  subsistence  population  into  the \nmainstream economy by (i) improving critical road links, (ii) establishing a sustainable and effective \nroad maintenance operation in the region, and (iii) improving sector management. The scope of the \nProject as defined in the Loan Agreement (Loan 1709-PNG)3 comprised four parts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nroad  improvements  in  the  Highlands  by  carrying  out  subprojects  consisting  of  (a) \nupgrading  of  approximately  220  km  of  roads,  and  (b)  asset  management  for  road \nnetworks, including rehabilitation of approximately 450 km of roads; \nprovision  of  formal  technical  training  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \nDepartment of Works (DOW) to undertake road maintenance and operation; \nprovision of detailed engineering design and construction supervision support for the \npreparation and execution of subprojects; and \nstrengthening  project  implementation  and  road  maintenance  operations  through \ninter alia: (a) on-the-job training on the use of the road asset management system \n(RAMS);  (b)  assistance  in  identification  of  technical  training  programs,  contract \nsupervision,  management,  and  quality  control;  (c)  formulation  of  community \nemployment  programs;  (d)  road  network  performance  monitoring;  and  (e)  financial \nmanagement. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \nC. \n \nThe total cost of the Project, including taxes, duties, and interest during construction, was \n7. \nestimated  at  $115  million  equivalent.  ADB  agreed  to  provide  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR)  a  loan  of  $63  million  equivalent,  financing  48%  of  civil  works  and  55%  of  the  total  project \ncost.  \n \nADB\u2019s loan was provided over 25 years, with a grace period of 5 years and an interest rate \n8. \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans.  \nLoan 1709-PNG was amended on 15 December 2002 to convert it into a London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  with  standard  lending  terms.  In  September  2003,  ADB  approved  the \nincrease  in  ADB\u2019s  share  of  financing  for  civil  works  from  48%  to  70%.  This  necessitated  scaling \ndown the project scope and total project cost from $115 million to $90.6 million.4 The original and \nrevised project cost estimates and financing plans are shown in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999.

Manila (17 November). \n\n4  The length of upgraded road was reduced from 220 km to 145 km, and of rehabilitated road from 450 km to 290 km. In \nhindsight,  the  need  for  ADB  financing  was  lower  than  expected,  as  few  subprojects  were  approved  or  contracts \nawarded. As a result, scaling down the project scope appears to have been unnecessary.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nTable 1: Original and Revised Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \nADB \n \n28.7 \n  8.7 \n \n37.4 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n5.1 \n\nOriginal \n \nGovt. \n \n21.3 \n18.7 \n \n40.0 \n \n1.5 \n0.7 \n2.2 \n \n0.9 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n50.0 \n27.4 \n \n77.4 \n \n1.5 \n0.7 \n2.2 \n \n6.0 \n\nRevised  \n \nGovt. \n \n6.1 \n9.9 \n \n    15.9 \n \n1.5 \n0.7 \n2.2 \n \n0.9 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n34.8 \n18.6 \n \n53.4 \n \n1.5 \n0.7 \n2.2 \n \n6.0 \n\n \nADB \n \n28.7 \n  8.7 \n \n  37.4 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n5.1 \n\nA.

A  team  of  implementation  advisors  was  fully  mobilized  in  August  2002.  The \nHighlands  Region  Maintenance  Group  (HRMG)\u2014consisting  of  implementation  advisors,  project \nmanagers  and  maintenance  managers  from  DOW,  and  provincial  works  managers\u2014was \nestablished  to  implement  the  Project.  As  of  April  2006,  the  Project  had  achieved  60%  of \nimplementation  and  32%  of  loan  disbursement.  Progress  in  project  implementation  was  rated \nsatisfactory  in  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  report  (PPR).  Activities  undertaken  under  the  Project \nhave  included  (i) road  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  in  five  provinces,  (ii)  RAMS  extension,  (iii) \ntraining,  and  (iv) minor  rehabilitation  contracts.  The  status  of  activity  implementation  is  described \nbelow. \n \n10. \nRoad  Upgrading  and  Rehabilitation.  To  date,  ADB  has  approved  19  subprojects, \ninvolving  249.61  km  of  road  upgrading  and  211.41  km  of  road  rehabilitation.  Loan  1709-PNG \nfinanced  13  road  subprojects,  involving  161.41  km  of  road  upgrading  and  176.51  km  of  road \nrehabilitation.  The  other  six  subprojects  were  entirely  financed  by  the  Government.  As  of  May \n2006, of 19 road subprojects with 21 contracts, four subprojects had been completed, and seven \ncontracts awarded. Civil works on five roads were in progress, two of which, covering about 31 km, \nwere  90%  complete.  One  contract  awaited  signing,  and  the  remaining  nine  contracts  were  at \nvarious stages of tendering.  \n \nintegrated  pavement  and  maintenance \n11. \nmanagement  system,  is  a  central  planning  instrument  to  support  maintenance  scheduling, \nprioritizing  maintenance  needs,  and  preparing  budget  proposals.  It  was  established  in  DOW  with \n\nRAMS  Extension  Subproject.  RAMS,  an \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nthe  support  of  two  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects. 5  ADB  approved  a  RAMS \nextension  subproject  under  Loan  1709-PNG  in  November  2001.  The  objective  of  the  subproject \nwas to deliver training to enable government counterpart staff to incorporate RAMS as an integral \npart  of  DOW\u2019s  overall  asset  management  system  and  RAMS  to  function  as  a  self-sustaining, \nwholly indigenously operated method of planning and budgeting for road maintenance in PNG.  \n \nThe  international  consulting  firm  that  was  engaged  under  the  two  ADB  TA  projects6 to \n12. \nestablish  RAMS  nationally  and  extend  it  to  the  provinces  was  contracted  to  provide  the  training \nservices through the direct selection procedure. According to the final report of the consultant, from \nFebruary 2002 to June 2005, (i) 77.5 person-months of consulting services were provided, (ii) over \n50 formal training sessions conducted, and (iii) 700 government officials trained. The scope of the \ntraining  included  road  surveying;  data  collection;  project  management  in  interfacing  RAMS  with \noperations; prioritizing maintenance needs; and the use of databases, data, and maps. \n \n \n13. \nTraining.  The  consulting  firm  engaged  to  assist  in  project  implementation  has  provided \nsome training to HRMG counterpart staff members to enhance their technical capability to design \nand  manage  road  projects.  From  2001  to  2005,  the  consulting  firm  developed  a  strategic  human \nresource  development  plan  and  22  training  aids  and  users\u2019 manuals,  and  provided  41  training  to \n118  government  officials  from  DOW  provincial  offices,  provincial  planning  offices,  and  other \nprovincial  offices  in  the  form  of  on-the-job  training  or  training  courses.  Training  areas  included \nengineering  design,  project  management,  financial  management,  contract  administration  and \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  control,  road  upgrading  and  maintenance  methods,  computer \nskills,  documentation,  and  procedures.  Improvement  in  the  capacity  of  counterpart  staff  in  the \nareas of engineering design, contract administration and construction supervision, quality control, \nand computer skills is clearly evident. \n \n14.  Minor Rehabilitation Contracts. Between 2001 and June 2005, HRMG helped DOW and \nprovincial  works  officers  recruit  local  contractors  to  provide  routine  and  emergency  road \nmaintenance in the five Highlands provinces. HRMG reviewed the draft contracts and supervised \nconstruction works. Altogether, 112 projects covering about 1,000 km with a total contract value of \nK21.47 million were completed. In addition, HRMG awarded several community-based contracts to \ncarry out routine maintenance in the region. These civil works contracts provided job opportunities \nto local communities and played an important role in keeping the roads in good condition.  \n \n15. \nCompliance  with  Covenants  of  Loan  1709-PNG.  Most  of  the  covenants  of  Loan  1709-\nPNG have been complied with. However, two covenants addressing sector issues were only partly \ncomplied with (footnote 6). \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Road Asset Management Project. Manila (TA 3004-\nPNG for $1.0 million); and ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Road Asset Management \nSystem in the Provinces. Manila (TA 3378-PNG for $0.581 million). \n\n6  Covenant  of  paragraph  8  of  schedule  5  of  the  loan  states:  \u201cThe  Borrower  shall  establish,  within  three  months  of  the \nEffective  Date,  a  road  maintenance  trust  account  for  each  province  within  the  Highlands  Region,  to  be  operated  in \naccordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB, and deposit therein each year in total [of] not less than 15 million \nkina  in  1999  prices  (i.e.,  three  million  kina  for  each  province  within  the  Highlands  Region)  in  quarterly  payments, \nadjusted  in  each  year  for  annual  inflation,  in  the  following  minimum  amounts  for  each  quarterly  installment:  First \nQuarter 20 percent; Second Quarter 30 percent; Third Quarter 30 percent; and Fourth Quarter 20 percent. Covenant of \nparagraph 4a of schedule 5 of the loan states that, by 31 December 2000, the Borrower shall: (a) taking into account \nthe  recommendations  made  under  the  Cost  Recovery  TA  (i)  fully  implement,  by  outsourcing  or  otherwise,  effective \naxle-load testing and control and (ii) establish and commence implementation of an appropriate scale of fines to deter \naxle-overloading and (b) complete installation of an operational weighbridge in Lae in accordance with arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n16. \nFor  the  first  covenant,  it  appears  that  the  deadline  was  not  realistic.  The  provincial  trust \naccounts were not established in light of the Government\u2019s efforts to improve fiscal discipline and \nthe potential risk that the funds would be misused. However, sufficient funds have been disbursed \nor allocated by the Government for maintaining the roads. The Government disbursed or allocated \nfrom its budget over K120 million for maintaining roads in the Highlands over the life of the Project. \nThis is more than the K15 million a year initially agreed. The counterpart funds directly required for \nthe approved subprojects have been sufficient. \n \n17. \nThe  second  covenant  was  not  complied  with  in  due  course,  but  the  following  positive \ndevelopments  are  noteworthy.  A  proposal  for  outsourcing  was  submitted  by  the  consultants  in \nJanuary 2003 and is currently being processed by the National Road Authority (NRA) for the bridge \nin Lae, which is the only location identified so far where it has been necessary to have such control \nin  place  (a  management  contract  reviewed  by  ADB  will  soon  be  submitted  to  the  successful \noperator).  The  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  has  developed  a  scale  of  fines  to  deter  axle-\noverloading  that  is  currently  under  review  by  NRA.  Finally,  the  weighbridge  in  Lae  is  in  good \noperating  condition.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  Lae  bridge  facility  was  not  operated  by \nDOW, but by DOT initially in 2005  and then by NRA. These developments are consistent with the \npolicy dialogue conducted with ADB on road sector reform. Proceeds from the operations will be \nallocated to the road fund administered by NRA. \n \nLikelihood  of  Achieving  the  Development  Objectives.  Project  implementation  was \n18. \nsubstantially delayed in the early years, but it gained momentum in 2004. With a more experienced \nproject  implementation  officer  and  lessons  learned,  the  Project  is  making  steady  progress  and \nhaving a major impact in the Highlands. Clear evidence exists that passenger and freight traffic has \nincreased significantly on the roads completed under Loan 1709-PNG. With more roads completed \none after another in the next 2 years, a major impact on economic and social development in the \nHighlands is expected. The likelihood of achieving development objectives was rated satisfactory \nin the PPR.  \n \n19. \nStrengths  and Weaknesses of the Project. The Project has a good geographic focus. It \nserves  a  populous  region  with  great  development  potential.  The  objectives  of  the  Project    are  in \nline with the Government\u2019s development strategy and its transport sector development strategy. It \naddresses human basic needs and promotes industrial and agricultural activities, exports, tourism, \nincome generation, and social cohesion in the Highlands by facilitating access between production \nareas and market centers. HRMG is experienced and involving a larger number of local technical \nstaff  in  project  design  and  supervision.  This  has  contributed  to  capacity  development  in  the  road \nsector  of  the  five  project  provinces,  and  to  retaining  that  expertise  in  the  provinces.  The  project \nimplementation  start-up delay  was  partly  due  to  the  difficulty  of  setting  up  HRMG  as  a  functional \nproject  implementation  unit.  Formal  training  provided  by  implementation  advisors,  combined  with \nlearning  by  doing,  has  brought  clear  improvement  in  the  capacity  of  HRMG  in  the  areas  of \nengineering design, contract administration, construction supervision, quality control, and computer \nskills.  HRMG\u2019s  existence  and  improved  capacity  will  facilitate  implementation  of  supplementary \nfinancing.  \n \nLessons  Learned.  The  design  of  supplementary  financing  has  taken  into  account  the \n20. \nlessons  learned  under  Loan  1709-PNG,  which  are  detailed  in  Appendix  2.  Loan  1709-PNG \nfollowed  the  sector  lending  approach.  Identifying  road  subprojects  and  providing  economic, \nenvironmental, and social justifications, as well as cost estimates, which should have been done at \nthe  project  preparatory  stage,  were  left  until  after  ADB  approved  the  loan.  Identifying  and \napproving  each  subproject  proved  to  be  time-consuming.  Procurement  followed  the  two-stage \nbidding process with prequalification, even though the small construction sector in PNG has limited \ncompetition. This resulted in delayed contract awards.   \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n \nA. \n\n21. \nBuilding  on  the  efforts  already  made  by  the  Government  and  the  international  consulting \nteam, supplementary financing has prioritized 11 roads from 45 subproject pre-investment studies \nand will submit them for ADB one-time approval. Due diligence on technical, economic, financial, \nand environmental viability, and social safeguards, have been completed and scrutinized for all 11 \nroads.  Cost  estimates  were  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  selected  roads,  types  of \nintervention, quantities required, and realistic unit costs. Procurement will follow the one-stage one-\nevelope  procurement  procedure  with  post-qualification.  A  more  experienced  project \nimplementation  office  is  already  in  place  and  has  been  active  in  project  preparation.  These \nmeasures promise to substantially improve project performance. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nProposed Supplementary Financing \nSupplementary  financial  assistance  will  provide  financing  for  (i)  additional  upgrading7 and \n22. \nrehabilitation of road sections corresponding to the 11 subprojects, with a total length of 270 km in \nthe  five  Highlands  provinces,  and  (ii)  related  consulting  services  for  detailed  engineering  design, \npreconstruction activities, construction supervision, project performance monitoring and evaluation, \nand  training  on  road  maintenance,  road  safety,  and  STI/HIV/AIDS  prevention.  Eleven  road \nsections8 have  been  screened  and  pre-selected  for  supplementary  financing  based  on  various \ncriteria such as (i) their linkage with subprojects already approved by ADB under Loan 1709-PNG, \n(ii)  Government  priorities, 9  (iii)  economic  rate  of  return,  (iv)  social  and  environmental \nconsiderations,  and  (v)  public  consultations.  ADB  conducted  extensive  consultations  with  the \ncentral and provincial governments and local stakeholders on the selection of the road subprojects \nin  November  2005  and  March  2006.  The  names  of  the  provinces,  road  sections,  types  of \ntreatment, and length are shown in Table 2.  \n\nProvince \n\nRoad Section \n\nLength (km) \n\nTreatment \n\nTable 2:  Prioritized Road Sections \n\nEastern Highlands \n\nWestern Highlands \n\nChimbu \n\nEnga \n\nSouthern Highlands \n\nOkapa\u2013Raipinka \n\nKamaliki\u2013Move \n\nGoroka\u2013Lahame \n\nKindeng\u2013Kondopina \n\nBanz\u2013Dona \n\nGewa\u2013Gembogl \n\nKerowagi\u2013Dona \n\nKorinige\u2013Kerowagi \n\nWarumanda\u2013Laiagam \n\nIalibu\u2013Kagua \n\nIalibu\u2013Pangia \n\n51 \n\n34 \n\n13 \n\n11 \n\n19 \n\n21 \n\n29 \n\n7 \n\n31 \n\n32 \n\n22 \n\nRehabilitation \n\nRehabilitation \n\nUpgrading \n\nUpgrading \n\nUpgrading \n\nRehabilitation \n\nRehabilitation \n\nUpgrading \n\nUpgrading \n\nRehabilitation \n\nRehabilitation \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n           km = kilometer \n           Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe impact and outcome of the supplementary financing are in line with those of the Project \nADB  approved  in  1999.  It  aims  to  scale  up  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  PNG  economic  development \nand  social  integration  by  financing  more  road  sections  to  (i)  improve  road  access  for  the  private \n\n                                                 \n7 Upgrading means sealing, without widening and realigning the road.   \n8 All 11 roads are from the long list in the RRP. They are the continuation of the roads financed by Loan 1709-PNG. \n9 The 11 roads were further prioritized from the Government priority list sent in June 2005.   \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nRationale  \n\nbusinesses  and  communities,  (ii)  reduce  their  travel  costs  and  time  to  major  commercial  and \nservice centers, and (iii) enable them to tap economic and social opportunities in the Highlands. It \nwill support the Government\u2019s efforts to enhance export-led economic growth, generate income for \nlocal  communities,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  rural  access  to  market \ncenters. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nJustifying supplementary financing in this Project are four main points. Firstly, the proceeds \nof  Loan  1709-PNG  have  been  fully  committed  and  are  able  to  finance  only  a  total  of  338  km \n(consisting  of  161.41  km  of  upgraded  road  and  176.51  km  of  rehabilitated  road).  This  length \nconstitutes only 50.4% of the total length of the roads originally targeted (670 km including 220 km \nof  upgraded  road  and  450  km  of  rehabilitated  road).  The  financial  shortfall  was  due  to  a \ncombination of factors, including underestimation of costs at the time of appraisal, delayed project \nimplementation,  and  lack  of  competition  in  PNG\u2019s  construction  sector.  Loan  1709-PNG  did  not \nbudget  any  physical  and  price  contingencies.  Civil  works  base  cost  estimates  for  some  road \nsections  were  very  low.  Inflation  between  1999  and  2003  was  double  digit.  The  delay  in  project \nimplementation meant actual costs were much higher than envisaged at appraisal, for labor by 5\u20136 \ntimes,  equipment  5\u201330  times,  and  materials  1.8\u20132.9  times.  Lack  of  competition  in  PNG\u2019s \nconstruction  sector  resulted  in  high  bid  prices.  The  reduced  project  scope,  if  not  remedied,  will \ncertainly  compromise  the  achievement  of  the  intended  purposes  and  objectives  as  initially \nconceived  for  the  Project.  With  the  additional  proposed  subprojects  financed  by  supplementary \nloans,  the  total  length  of  roads  financed  by  ADB  will  reach  608  km  (including  242.41  km  for \nupgrading  and  365.51  km  for  rehabilitation),  enabling  achievement  of  91%  of  the  original  project \nscope.  The  selected  roads  are  continuations  of  ongoing  road  subprojects  financed  under  Loan \n1709-PNG, as indicated in the map, and will increase connectivity. \n \n25. \nSecondly, deteriorating transport infrastructure is a particular concern for PNG. Four years \nago,  a  study  completed  by  the  Eastern  Highlands  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  revealed \nthat  poor  road  conditions  caused  an  estimated  30%  decline  in  coffee  shipped  from  Eastern \nHighlands  Province.  Crime  rates  also  increased  as  a  result  of  the  poor  roads,  with  coffee  stolen \nfrom buyers.  \n \n26. \nThe Government attaches great importance to improving transport infrastructure to achieve \nits  overarching  development  strategy  of  export-driven  economic  growth,  rural  development,  and \npoverty  reduction.  Transport  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  is  the  first  of  seven \nexpenditure  priorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (2005\u20132010) \n(MTDS).  The  proposed  financing  of  subprojects  is  in  line  with  the  MTDS  and  the  latest  National \nTransport  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010,  the  implementation  plan  for  the  MTDS.  The  Highlands \nare  indeed  strategically  important  for  the  country,  as  they  are  richly  endowed  with  natural  and \ntourism  resources  and  ecological  conditions  for  farming,  as  well  as  being  home  to  almost  half  of \nthe population. Developing the infrastructure network in this region will have significant impact on \nPNG\u2019s  overall  economic  and  social  performance.  The  country\u2019s  most  significant  road,  the \nHighlands  Highway,  runs  through  the  region,  bringing  to  Lae  port  copper,  coffee,  and  tea  (the \ncountry\u2019s major export items) and distributing in the region imports ranging from heavy machinery \nto  food.  The  Government  has  set  aside  K225  million  for  the  next  4  years  to  upgrade  and \nrehabilitate  the  Highlands  Highway.  It  is  also  planning  to  invest  in  Lae  port  and  has  officially \nrequested ADB assistance in expanding Lae port capacity. It would be  timely for ADB to provide \nthe additional financing to upgrade and rehabilitate more roads that connect major farming areas, \nresource  and  population  centers,  and  tourist  sites  in  the  Highlands  region  to  the  Highlands \nHighway. The additional financing will complement efforts by the Government and ADB, particularly \nwith respect to developing Lae port. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n27. \nThirdly, the proposed supplementary financing is consistent with the ADB country strategy \nfor  PNG,  as  documented  in  the  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  update  2005\u2013200610 and  in \ndiscussions on the CSP 2006\u2013201011, currently under preparation. Programming discussions have \nagreed  that  the  transport  sector  is  one  of  four  priority  sectors  or  themes  for  the  upcoming  CSP \n2006-2010, with ADB support to focus on the roads and maritime subsectors.   \n \n28. \nFourthly,  supplementary  financing  will  be  efficient  and  cost  effective  in  terms  of  project \npreparation  and  implementation  by  capitalizing  on  the  established  project  implementation  office \nand strengthened capability. It has taken more than 2 years for the Project to set up HRMG as a \nfunctional project implementation unit. With on-the-job and formal training provided by international \nconsultants, and learning by doing, HRMG has strengthened its capacity and finally become a fully \nfledged project implementation office consisting of a designing arm and a construction supervision \nteam.  It  is  capable  of  implementing  more  subprojects,  including  engineering  design,  preparing \nbidding  documents,  tendering  and  awarding  contracts,  and  supervising  construction,  without \nincurring  substantial  start-up  costs.  HRMG  is  currently  implementing  the  Project  efficiently.  It  will \nlikely be able to implement additional proposed subprojects in the same fashion, resulting in start-\nup cost savings of at least $2 million.    \n \n29. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  financing  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  specified  in  the  policy \npaper on supplementary financing approved in November 2005. The additional road upgrading and \nrehabilitation subprojects identified for financing by the supplementary loans are within the original \nproject  scope  and  continue  to  be  a  priority  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy. \nSupplementary  financing  will  help  achieve  the  objectives  of  Loan  1709-PNG,  which  were  to \ncontribute to PNG economic development and social integration by improving road infrastructure. \nSupplementary  financing  will  benefit  from  the  established  international  consulting  team,  a \nseasoned project implementation office, and enhanced technical expertise gained from the Project. \nIt is technically feasible, institutionally sound, and economically viable.  \n \nD. \n \n30. \nDue  diligence  has  been  done  to  ensure  that  environmental  and  social  safeguards  for  the \nselected 11 road subprojects accord with ADB policies. Since the Project involves interventions on \nexisting road alignments, and will not entail land acquisition or involuntary resettlement; it has been \nclassified as category C regarding involuntary resettlement and indigenous people.  \n \n31. \nThe environmental categorization for the 11 subprojects is category B. Initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) were carried out for all 11 roads, and IEE reports for 11 roads and a summary \nIEE  (SIEE)  were  prepared.  According  to  IEEs,  none  of  the  selected  roads  passes  through \nenvironmentally  sensitive  or  conservation  area.  Most  of  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  are \nrelated  to  regular  construction  activities,  which  are  temporary  and  can  be  mitigated  by  taking \n(EMMP). \nmeasures  detailed \nEnvironmental  impacts  such  as  noise,  reduced  air  quality,  and  traffic  accidents  during  the \noperational  phase  are  considered  low  because  of  the  low  traffic  volume.  No  cumulative \nenvironmental impacts were identified. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  proposed  subprojects  for  supplementary  financing\u2014including  civil \nworks, consulting services, contingencies, taxes and duties, interest during construction, and other \n\nthe  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans \n\nRevised Cost Estimates  \n\nSafeguards \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

The OCR loan will \ncarry a term of 24 years, with a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft OCR loan. The Government has provided ADB \nwith  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent  decision  not  relying  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  ADF  loan  will \nhave  a  maturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, equal amortization, and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft ADF loan. ADF and OCR loans will be disbursed on a \npro rata basis (Appendix 4). \n \n35. \nADB will finance 68% of the total cost of the additional road subprojects in the Project, while \nthe  Government  will  provide  $25.07  million  equivalent  to  finance  the  remaining  cost. 12  The \nfinancing plan is presented in Appendix 3 and summarized in Table 5.  \n \n\nTable 5: Financing Plan for Proposed Subprojects \n($ million) \n \n\n  Total Cost \n\nPercentage\n\nAsian Development Bank  \n\nSource \n\n   OCR \n\n   ADF \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n53.00\n\n35.00\n\n18.00\n\n25.07\n\n78.07\n\n68 \n\n   45 \n\n   23 \n\n   32 \n\n100 \n\n \n\n    ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n36. \nThe  use  of  ADF  financing  is  justified  by  ADB\u2019s  country  classification  for  PNG  and  PNG\u2019s \nsocial and economic status. As ADB\u2019s current country classification stands, PNG is a category B2 \ncountry whose limited debt repayment capacity entitles it to limited ADF financing.  \n \nA  World  Bank  assessment13 found  that  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  PNG  had  increased \n37. \nsignificantly in recent years. Using a poverty line that allows for 2,200 calories per adult equivalent \nper  day  and  an  allowance  for  basic  nonfood  expenditure,  which  is  similar  to  the  PNG  national \npoverty line, 37.5% of the PNG population was considered poor in 1996. This figure had risen to \n54% in 2003. The trend was the same for the international poverty line of $1 per day, by which the \nestimated incidence of poverty had grown from 25% to 40%. In terms of the human development \nindex, PNG ranked 133 out of 177 countries in 2004. Its social indicators are among the lowest in \nthe  Pacific  region. The Highlands, home  to  the  highest  portion  of  the  poor,  are  mountainous  and \ngeologically  unstable,  with  torrential  rains  that  can  last  6  or  7  months.  Road  construction  and \nmaintenance are costly, requiring concessional funding.  \n                                                 \n12  Budgeted  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  budget  as  a  separate  line  item.

Contractors  with  adequate  technical  and  financial \ncapacity will be allowed to bid for several packages and may be awarded more than one contract \nbased on the least-cost combination of contracts.  \n \n  \n \n42. \nInternational consulting services will be required to assist in (i) detailed engineering design, \n(ii) preconstruction activities, (iii) construction supervision, (iv) project performance monitoring and \nevaluation,  and  (v)  training  on  road  maintenance  and  safety  and  on  STI/HIV/AIDS  prevention. \nUnder  Loan  1709-PNG,  an  international  consulting  firm  (the  initial  consultant)  was recruited  on  a \ncompetitive  basis  to  assist  in  project  design  and  implementation,  construction  supervision,  and \ntraining. As Loan 1709-PNG followed a sector approach, the initial consultant has helped HRMG \ncomplete pre-investment studies on more than 45 subprojects for ADB consideration, including the \nproposed  11  road  sections.  Engineering  design,  preparing  bidding  documents,  and  implementing \nroad subprojects financed by supplementary loans are tasks that represent a natural continuation \nof the previous work carried out by the initial consultant.  \n \n43. \nAfter years of working in the Highlands, the initial consultant has acquired knowledge about \nthe  PNG  road  sector,  the  local  culture,  and  the  topographic  and  geotechnical  conditions  of  the \nstudied  subprojects.  Continuity  in  technical  approach,  experience  acquired,  and  continued \nprofessional \ninitial  consultant\u2019s  services.  The  project \nimplementation  schedule  in  Appendix  5  assumes  that  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  for \nproject implementation, including the services of the initial consultant, will be maintained. From the \ncost  perspective,  retaining  the  services  of  the  initial  consultant  will  save  at  least  $2  million  in \nconsulting  services,  because  its  current  contract  will  end  in  June  2008,  and  will  only  need  to  be \nextended by 1.5 years.  \n \nRecruiting  a  new  consultant  has  been  considered  and  found  impractical.  Firstly,  the \n44. \nselection  process  would  take  at  least  6  months.  Secondly,  consultant  mobilization  may  take \nanother 1\u20132 years, as happened in this Project and others in PNG. Thirdly, engineering design and \nbidding for civil works will take another year. This means that initial implementation delays under \nLoan 1709-PNG will be repeated under the supplementary loans if new recruitment is conducted.  \n \n45. \nIn  summary,  retaining  the  services  of  the  initial  consultant  observes  ADB\u2019s  principles  of \neconomy  and  efficiency.  Hence,  the  single-source  selection  method  for  the  continuation  of  the \ninitial consultant is proposed for the international consulting services. It is proposed that the initial \nconsultant\u2019s  contract  be  extended  by  1.5  years  (132  person-months),  from  June  2008  until \nDecember  2009.  The  Borrower  will  ask  the  initial  consultant  to  prepare  technical  and  financial \nproposals on the basis of the outline terms of reference presented in Appendix 7.  \n \n46. \nDomestic consulting services for project design, construction supervision, financial auditing, \nand training on road maintenance, road safety, and STI/HIV/AIDS prevention for the Project will be \nrequired  and  financed  by  the  Government.  The  Government  will  recruit  the  domestic  consultants \nfollowing Government procedures acceptable to ADB.   \n \n\nthe \n\n \n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n47. \nThe  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  procurement  action  for  recruiting \nconsulting services and procuring civil works. Approval of advance action was granted during the \nmanagement review meeting. Advance action covers inviting bids, bidding, and bid evaluation but \nnot awarding contracts. Advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nGuidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nSupplementary  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n48. \nHandbook.  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used  for  road  subprojects \nfinanced by the supplementary loans.  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nRecent experience indicates that financial management with regard to accounting, auditing, \nand  reporting  is  satisfactory  and  does  not  require  adjustment.  DOW  will  continue  to  maintain \nseparate  accounts  to  identify  civil  works  and  services  financed  by  Loan  1709-PNG  and \nsupplementary loans, prepare separate financial statements indicating the sources and application \nof funds, and have them audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. Financial auditing \nhas been budgeted under the Project and will be funded by the Government. The audited project \naccounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB in English within 6 months after the end \nof each financial year. DOW will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports and \nprovide to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of project completion. \n\n8.  \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n50. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  agree,  prior  to  April  2007,  upon  a  set  of  indicators  for \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance  and  the  performance  of  each  road  subproject \nfinanced  by  Loan  1709-PNG  and  supplementary  loans  in  relation  to  the  Project\u2019s  goals  and \npurposes, with an emphasis on economic and social activities. Six person-months of international \nconsulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  establish  and  monitor  indicators  and \nevaluate project performance. The consultant will  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nestablish  a  set  of  social  and  poverty  impact  indicators  for  the  Project  and  gender-\ndisaggregated  baseline  data  for  road  sections  whose  civil  works  have  not \ncommenced; \nreview and compare the data during project implementation and completion; \nmonitor and evaluate ongoing and completed road sections; \nprepare subproject completion reports; \nprovide hands-on training on data collection and monitoring to DOW; and \nassess the overall socioeconomic impacts of the Project. The indicators may include \n(a) economic  activities  and  income  level  in  the  project  area,  (b) industrial  and \nagricultural outputs, (c) transport costs and time, (d) transport services and charges, \n(e) accident rates, (f) level of social services including school enrollment and infant \nmortality, (g) access to STI/HIV/AIDS information and service, and (h) jobs created \n(employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled laborers, poor \nlaborers, and women laborers). \n\nProject Review \n\n9. \n \n51. \nADB will review the Project every 6 months. Each review will cover all relevant aspects that \nmay  have  an  impact  on  the  Project\u2019s  performance  and  continuing  viability,  either  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, the status of compliance \nwith covenants stipulated in each loan, financial, or other aspects.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n52. \nADB  has  recently  completed  a  project  procurement-related  audit  of  the  Project  and  found \nno  clear  indications  of  potential  fraud  and  corruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was \nexplained to the Government and DOW and discussed with them. The Government and DOW shall \nadhere  to  ADB  anticorruption  requirements  during  project  implementation.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of DOW and \nall  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  If \nADB  determines  that  representatives  of  the  Borrower,  a  beneficiary,  a  contractor,  and/or  a \nconsultant  engaged  in  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices,  ADB  may  take  the \nfollowing actions: (i) reject any proposal for contract award and/or (ii) declare any firm or individual \nineligible for ADB-financed contracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCING BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n53. \nThe proposed supplementary financing will generate substantial economic benefits. Normal \ntraffic  growth  rates  were  based  on  the  projected  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rate \nestimated  to  be  3%  annually  for  2006\u20132025.  Additional  traffic  is  generated  either  because  a \njourney  becomes  more  attractive  by  virtue  of  its  costing  less  or  because  of  the  increased \ndevelopment brought about by the improved roads. For all selected road sections to be improved, \nthe generated traffic is assumed to equal 5% of normal traffic that would occur during the first year \nafter  rehabilitation  works  end.  This  assumption  is  made  based  on  the  presence  of  intense \nagricultural activities in the 11 identified project areas. \n \nThe economic analysis was carried out for the 11 subprojects by comparing scenarios with \n54. \nand without the Project using the highway design and management model. The economic analysis \ncovers  20  years  (2006\u20132025)  for  the  upgrade-to-sealed  option  and  15  years  (2006\u20132020)  for  re-\ngravelling,  with  the  construction  periods  varying  between  1  and  2  years  starting  in  2007.  All \nbenefits and costs are in constant 2006 prices. All prices are expressed in PNG kina. \n \n55. \nThe economic costs of all the subprojects proposed for financing under the supplementary \nloans  are  (i)  the  capital  cost,  including  labor,  equipment  and  materials,  consulting  services  and \nphysical contingency, and (ii) the costs of maintaining project roads. The economic benefits arise \nfrom (i) savings in vehicle operating cost, particularly repair costs, from improved road conditions; \n(ii)  savings  in  maintenance  costs;  (iii)  time  savings  for  road  users;  and  (iv)  benefits  to  generated \ntraffic. The subprojects proposed for financing under the Project will also have other benefits, such \nas improving food security and access to economic and social services, which were not included in \nthe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation.  \n \n56. \nUsing a 12% discount rate, the economic benefits are substantial. The net present value is \n$56.89  million,  and  the  EIRR  is  18.8%.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  the \n\n\f \n\n15\n\neconomic  viability  of  all  proposed  subprojects.  The  switching  value14 for  increased  rehabilitation \ncosts was determined to be 42.5%, and the switching value for decreased benefits 29.9%. In the \nworst-case  scenario,  with  a  combination  of  increased  costs  and  decreased  benefits,  the  net \npresent value would be reduced to K8.16 million, and the EIRR to 12.91%. The detailed economic \nanalysis is attached in Appendix 8. \n \nAccording  to  a  recent  assessment  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund,15 PNG\u2019s  economy \n57. \nhas been performing well since 2004. Real GDP grew by 3% in 2004, and a similar growth rate is \nexpected  for  2005.  A  sharp  reduction  in  inflation  occurred  in  2004,  and  inflation  is  estimated  to \nhave  averaged  1%  in  2005.  External  accounts  are  expected  to  be  in  surplus  in  2005.  Fiscal \noutcome also improved in 2005, with a budget deficit of 0.6%. As a result, public sector debt, about \nhalf  of  which  is  external,  shrank  from  72%  of  GDP  in  2002  to  49%  in  2005.  The  Government  is \ncontinuing  to  rationalize  public  expenditure  with  the  objective  of  controlling  debt  while  increasing \nexpenditure on priority areas such as transport infrastructure. Counterpart funding for ADB projects \nis  treated  as  a  priority  and  has  been  provided  to  Loan  1709-PNG.  Budget  allocation  for  road \nmaintenance has increased substantially from K15 million\u2013K20 million to K100 million in 2006. The \nroad fund has been established with an initial allocation of $20 million from the fuel tax. In view of \nthese developments, the Project is considered to be financially sustainable.  \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\nB.  \n \n58. \nThe proposed subprojects financed under the Project will contribute to alleviating poverty in \nthe  Highlands  by  providing  job  opportunities  and  promoting  agricultural  development  through \nimproved  road  access.  Upgrading  and  rehabilitating  the  11  roads  will  directly  generate  an \nestimated  1,500  local  employment  opportunities.  The  maintenance  program  for  the  roads \ncompleted under the Project will provide additional income opportunities for 6,000 people.  \n\n59. \nPNG\u2019s  economy  is  highly  dualistic,  with  a  small  modern  sector  coexisting  with  a  large \nsubsistence  sector.  More  than  85%  of  the  population  resides  in  rural  areas,  surviving  by \nsubsistence agriculture and/or cash crop production. The Highlands are fertile but have the highest \nincidence of poverty because residents are isolated from market and social service centers. The 11 \nproposed road sections connect the Highlands\u2019 major coffee, fruit, and vegetable production areas \nto the Highlands Highway and city centers, serving a population of more than 600,000. Improved \nand rehabilitated roads will help farmers increase their income from cash crops by easing access  \nto markets and reducing costs for traders collecting produce, as well as by allowing farmers to tap \nmarket  opportunities  in  city  centers.  The  increased  income  and  improved  road  conditions  will \nfacilitate access to education and health services in city centers, thereby contributing to the well-\nbeing of the population.  \n\nC.  \n\nSocial and Gender Impact \n\n60. \nThe  social  and  gender  impacts  of  the  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  were \nassessed during the ADB Fact-Finding Mission, and a summary of the poverty reduction and social \nstrategy appears in Appendix 9. It was found that women in the Highlands are currently involved in \na  broad  range  of  activities  related  to  road  construction,  road  maintenance,  and  commercial \nroadside  services.  The  proposed  subprojects  will  provide  more  income-earning  opportunities  for \nwomen. An estimated 25\u201330% of the workforce for the Project will be women. \n\n                                                 \n14 The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for the \n\nnet present value to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cut-off level of 12%. \n\n15 International Monetary Fund. 2006. IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea. Washington, \n\nDC. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n61. \nThe  presence  of  the  construction  workforce  at  subproject  sites  and  the  opening  up  of \nisolated  areas  may  expose  the  local  population  to  STI/HIV/AIDS  risk.  The  proposed  Project  will \nfinance training and awareness campaigns in each province and require contractors, through civil \nworks  contracts,  to  take  preventive  measures  to  mitigate  the  risk.  Other  than  the  STI/HIV/AIDS \nissue, no adverse impacts on vulnerable groups and indigenous people were identified. \n\nD.  \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n62. \nThe  proposed  subprojects  under  the  Project  have  been  categorized  as  environmental \ncategory  B  project  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003).  Environmental  assessment  has  been  carried  out  for  all  11  road \nsections.  IEE  reports  and  EMMP  have  been  prepared  and  agreed  with  the  Government.  A \nsummary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 10. \n \n63. \nVarious consultations, a review of documents, and field assessments of the proposed road \nsections lead to the conclusion that significant and/or irreversible impacts are unlikely and that the \n11 road sections comply with ADB's Environment Policy. In particular, the proposed road sections \nare  not  located  in  environmentally  sensitive  or  conservation  areas.  Road  improvement  will  not \nincrease  logging  or  hunting  and  are  strongly  supported  and  requested  by  local  communities.  No \nsignificant  cumulative  impacts  are  identified.  Moreover,  the  proposed  roadwork  is  limited  to \nrehabilitating or upgrading existing roads and can generally be carried out within the existing road \nreserve. \n \n64. \nAs  summarized  in  EMMP,  which  will  be  part  of  the  contractors\u2019  subcontract,  all  potential \nenvironmental  concerns  can  properly  be  mitigated  and  minimized  to  acceptable  levels.  As  such, \nthe scope of the rehabilitation and upgrading of the proposed road sections and their anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  do  not  require  further  study.  The  supporting  EMMP  will  provide  sufficient \nguidance  for  HRMG  staff  to  successfully  monitor  and  report  on  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \ncompliance.  \n \nE.  \n \nThe subprojects to be financed under the Project are subject to the usual risks of transport \n65. \nprojects.  These  include  project  start-up  delay,  road  sustainability,  environmental  impacts,  and \nSTI/HIV/AIDS exposure. The design of the Project has taken into account these risks and includes \nmitigating measures. To minimize project implementation delay, all 11 road subprojects have been \nscreened,  and  due  diligence  has  been  completed.  The  existing  institutional  arrangements, \nincluding  consulting  services  for  project  implementation,  will  be  maintained  to  ensure  continuity \nand avoid disruptions. Detailed engineering design and the preparation of bidding documents are \nunder way and will be finalized during project implementation. Procurement of civil works will follow \na  single-stage  one-evelope  bidding  procedure  with  post-qualification  in  order  to  expedite  the \nprocurement bidding process. With all the measures proposed above, completion of the Project will \nlikely be by the end of 2009, as indicated in the detailed implementation schedule.   \n\nProject Risks \n\nThe issue of road sustainability has been extensively discussed by ADB missions and the \n66. \nGovernment  during  project  processing  and  has  been  addressed  in  the  Project.  HRMG  will \nimplement a contracting-out system to engage local communities or contractors to provide routine \nand periodic maintenance for ADB-financed roads so that the life of the completed roads can be \nextended. Road maintenance will be contracted out starting in 2007. An assurance is included to \nensure  that  the  Government  will  maintain  the  road  sections  funded  by  Loan  1709-PNG  and  the \nsupplementary loans.  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n67. \nEnvironmental  impacts  during  construction  will  be  mitigated  by  DOW\u2019s  implementing \nEMMP, which include the obligation to incorporate mitigation measures into civil works contracts, \nand by monitoring these contracts. Monitoring results will be reflected in project progress reports. \nThe impact of STI/HIV/AIDS will be mitigated by incorporating appropriate conditions in civil works \ncontracts  that  require  contractors  to  adopt  preventive  measures,  supplemented  by  training  and \nawareness campaigns financed by the Project. The preventive measures undertaken under each \nroad section will be monitored and reflected in the project progress reports, which will be submitted \nto the National AIDS Council and the Country Coordinating Mechanism.  Assurance has also been \ngiven by the Government with respect to health standards.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n68. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and DOW have given the following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nProject  executing  agency.  DOW  will  continue  to  act  as  the  Project  Executing \nAgency  as  set  forth  in  Loan  1709-PNG  responsible  for  overall  execution  and \ncoordination of the Project. \nProject  implementation  unit.  HRMG, assisted by a team of consultants engaged \nunder the Project, will continue to act as the Project Implementation Unit. HRMG will \nremain  headed  by  a  project  director,  who  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  qualified \ntechnical,  financial,  and  support  staff.  The  Government  will  continue  to  provide \nHRMG  with  adequate  office  space  and  support  services  in  a  form  satisfactory  to \nADB throughout the implementation period.   \nProject  steering  committee  (PSC).    The  PSC  set  forth  in  Loan  1709-PNG  will \ncontinue  to  act  as  the  Project  Steering  Committee  to  ensure  close  interagency \ncoordination and monitor the implementation of the Project. The PSC will be chaired \nby a provincial administrator and will be composed of five provincial administrators, \nfive  Government  agencies,  and  two  representatives  from  the  private  sector.  The \nGovernment,  through  DOW,  will  ensure  that  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to \nreview the progress of implementation and provide support and guidance on project \nimplementation, as necessary.   \nCounterpart funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds and \nresources  necessary  for  upgrading,  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and  management \nof the project facilities financed under the Project.  \nConstruction quality.  The Government, through DOW, will ensure that the project \nroads  are  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  according  to  technical  specifications  of  the \ndesign.  In  addition,  the  Government,  through  DOW,  will  ensure  that  construction \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  project  management  are  performed  according  to \ninternationally accepted standards.  \nRoad  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  appropriate  road  safety  facilities \nsuch  as  pavement  markings,  warning  signs,  traffic  signs  and  signals,  and  hazard \nbarriers  are  installed  during  project  implementation  and  after  completion  and  that \nadequate training on road safety is provided to local communities by HRMG.  \n(vii)  Road  maintenance.  The Government, through DOW, will ensure that (a) sufficient \nfunds are allocated for the maintenance of the roads financed under the Project and \nto keep the Road Asset Management System operational, and (b) HRMG contracts \nout  routine  and  periodic  road  maintenance  with  local  communities  and  other \ncontractors.  \n\n(vi) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  National road authority. The Government will ensure full operation of the National \nRoad Authority by appointing the chief executive officer and other critical staff and \ndelineating responsibilities between DOW and the National Road Authority.  \nLabor.  The  Government,  through  DOW,  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors \ncomply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations  as  well  as  international \ntreaties;  do  not  employ  child  or  forced  labor  for  road  reconstruction,  rehabilitation, \nand  maintenance;  provide  equal  opportunities  for  women  in  road  reconstruction, \nrehabilitation,  and  maintenance  activities;  and  promptly  pay  equal  wages  to  men \nand women for work of equal value. DOW will ensure that specific provisions to this \neffect  are  included  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts  and  that \ncompliance is monitored on an ongoing basis. \nGender  and  development.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is \nimplemented  according  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development. 16  The \nGovernment, through HRMG, will (a) encourage local contractors to recruit women \nin  the  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance  of  the  roads  financed;  and \n(b) provide  safe  working  conditions  for  both  male  and  female  workers.  The \nGovernment, through HRMG, will ensure that the above requirements are included \nin the bidding documents and civil works contracts.  \nHealth standards. The Government, through HRMG, will ensure that all civil works \ncontractors  engaged  under  the  Project  will  participate  in  the  community-based \ntraining  programs  with  respect  to  road  safety  and  STI/HIV/AIDS  prevention  (in \nconsultation  with  Provincial  AIDS  Council  and  the  Health  Administration)  to  be \nfunded under the Project along the prioritized road sections. In addition, HRMG shall \nensure  that  similar  information  on  the  risk  of  transmission  of  STI/HIV/AIDS  is  also \ndisseminated  to  local  communities  in  the  corridor  of  influence,  in  coordination  with \nnational  agencies  working  on  this  issue.  Specific  provisions  to  this  effect  will  be \nincluded in civil works contracts, and compliance will be strictly monitored by HRMG \nthrough the engagement of a qualified international consultant.  \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Resettlement. The Government and DOW will ensure that all project rehabilitation \nand upgraded works are undertaken within the existing right of way. In the event of \nany  unforeseen  resettlement,  the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  and \nimplement a resettlement plan according to the relevant local laws and regulations, \nand  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  Government  will \nallocate  the  adequate  resources  to  prepare  and  implement  the  resettlement  plan, \nand supervise and monitor its implementation. The Government, through DOW, will \nensure  that  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  will  not  commence  before  the \nresettlement  plan  is  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB,  and  that  civil  works  will  not \nstart before the resettlement plan is approved by ADB.  \n\n(xiii)  Environment.

The  main \ncomponent  of  Loan  1709-PNG  was  to  upgrade  220  km  of  roads  and  rehabilitate  450  km.  To \ndate,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  approved  19  road  subprojects  involving  21 \ncontract packages for upgrading 249.61 km of roads and rehabilitating 211.41 km. Thirteen of \nthe subprojects are financed from Loan 1709-PNG, and six of them are financed entirely by the \nGovernment.  As  of  May  2006,  four  subprojects  involving  39.8  km  of  roads  had  been  fully \ncompleted,  and  seven  contract  packages  had  been  awarded.    Civil  works  of  five  subprojects \nwere  in  progress  (two  of  which  are  90%  completed),  one  contract  awaited  signing,  and  the \nremaining nine were at various stages of tendering.  \n \n2. \n(ii) procurement of civil works, and (ii) construction.  \n \nAt the first stage, establishing the project implementation unit proved difficult because of \n3.  \nthe challenging work environment in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the scarcity of qualified and \navailable  human  resources.  An  international  consulting  firm  engaged  in  November  2000  to \nstrengthen  project  implementation  and  maintenance  management  was  mobilized  in  January \nthe  chief \n2001.  Frequent  withdrawal  and  replacement  of \nimplementation advisor, occurred due to (i) the long visa application process, (ii) concerns over \nsecurity  and  living  conditions  in  the  country,  and  (iii)  health  and  family  reasons.  The \nimplementation  consulting  team  was  fully  mobilized  in  August  2002  and  has  been  stable  ever \nsince.  In  addition,  the  Government  required  a  long  time  to  appoint  qualified  fulltime  staff  to \nhandle the key positions in the Highlands Region Maintenance Group and provide office space. \nAnother  difficulty  was  identifying  the  road  subprojects  and  obtaining  ADB  approval.  Under  the \nsector lending approach, the borrower or the excuting agency (EA) is primarily responsible for \nidentifying,  prioritizing,  formulating,  appraising,  approving,  and  implementing  subprojects  in \naccordance  with  technical,  financial,  and  economic  appraisal  criteria,  including  social  and \nenvironmental criteria, mutually agreed between ADB and the borrower/EA.2 Between 2001 and \n2005, the Government sent about 45 subproject proposals, and ADB approved 19. Most of the \nsubprojects  were  approved  by  ADB  in  2004  (nine  approvals)  and  2005  (five).  From  2000  to \n2003, only five road subprojects had been approved by ADB, and 2003 saw no approvals.  \n \n4. \nIn the second stage, the Project experienced delays caused by the time-consuming two-\nstage international competitive bidding process and the slowness of the Government\u2019s approval \nprocedures.  Of  the  13  ADB-financed  civil  works  contracts,  11  went  through  a  prequalification \nstage. The average duration for prequalification was about 9 months, and from prequalification \nor  post-qualification  to  contract  award,  the  average  duration  for  the  10  contracts  was  20.5 \nmonths.  Pursuant to the Government\u2019s rules, any contract valued above K10 million (equivalent \nto  $3.2  million)  requires  the  approval  of  the  National  Executive  Council  (the  national  Cabinet) \nupon recommendation of the Central Supply and Tenders Board. This process caused delay in \nawarding contracts. Under Loan 1709-PNG, securing Government approval of contract awards  \nhas taken 2 to 9 months.  \n  \n\nthe  consultants, \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

(Loan  1709-PNG,  approved  on  16 \nNovember). \n\n2  ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section D3/BP: Sector Lending. Manila (29 October 2003). \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn  the  construction  stage,  road  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  have  suffered  from  the \n5. \ndifficult law and order situation in the Highlands, particularly in Southern Highlands, Enga, and \nWestern Highlands provinces. For example, shooting and killing in Western Highlands Province \nin November 2005 forced the contractors to stop civil works for 3 weeks. \n \n6.  \nSeveral  lessons  can  be drawn.  First,  for  a  fragile  state such  as  PNG,  ADB  could  have \nsupported the Government more in preparing the subprojects by helping it to (i) prioritize some \ninvestments;  (ii)  conduct  technical  feasibility  studies  and  financial,  environmental,  and  social \ndue  diligence;  and  (iii)  prepare  the  technical  design  and  bidding  documents.  Secondly,  ADB \nshould have supported the Government in mobilizing the core team for project implementation \nat  an  earlier  stage  to  minimize  the  delay  in  starting  the  project.  Thirdly,  procurement  of  civil \nworks  could  have  followed  a  one-stage  bidding  process  with  post-qualification,  as  the \nconstruction sector in PNG has limited competition. Lastly, ADB needs to strengthen its policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government,  aiming  to  simplify  the  latter\u2019s  approval  process  for  awarding \ncontracts.  \n \nAlthough  the  Project  experienced  substantial  delays  in  implementation  start-up,  it  is \n7.  \nnoteworthy that ADB is a major actor in the Highlands, playing a key role in promoting economic \nand social development by restoring and maintaining the road system. Recently, a large ground-\nbreaking ceremony for the Mendi\u2013Nipa road section, financed by Loan 1709-PNG, was held in \nSouthern  Highlands  Province.  The  provincial  governor  chaired  the  ceremony,  attended  by  the \nminister and secretary of works, vice minister of finance and treasury, acting attorney general, \nADB  representative,  and  an  unprecedented  crowd  of  about  70,000  villagers.  Popular  and \ngovernmental support for the road was impressive and encouraging. \n \n8.  \nFurthermore,  the  Project  has  gained  momentum  since  2004  and  is  progressing \nsatisfactorily,  with  major  contracts  awarded  and  civil  works  in  progress.  The  turnaround \noccurred in November 2003, when the ADB Review Mission agreed with DOW on steps to take \nto  speed  the  approval  of  subproject  proposals  and  procurement.  As  a  result,  nine  road \nsubprojects  were  approved  in  2004,  and  five  in  2005.  Two  contracts  were  awarded  in  2004, \nthree in 2005, and two in 2006. Impressed by the solid progress of the Project, the Government \nhas committed K91 million to fully finance five other road subprojects in the Highlands region.  \n \n9.  \nSupplementary  financing  is  an  efficient  means  to  capture  this  momentum  to  increase \nlocal  road  connectivity  and  so  support  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  of  economic \ngrowth,  income  generation,  and  poverty  reduction.  It  builds  on  efforts  already  made  by  the \nGovernment and international consulting team, and on the efficiency of the current, experienced \nproject \nits \nenvironmental, resettlement, and social safeguard polices.  \n \nThe design of supplementary financing takes into account the lessons learned from Loan \n10. \n1709-PNG.  From  45  subproject  pre-investment  studies,  11  road  subprojects  have  been \nprioritized  and  scrutinized,  and  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  one-time  approval.  Due  diligence  in \nline  with  ADB  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  has  been  completed  for  these \nsubprojects, and economic justification for each of them provided. Subproject technical design \nand  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents  are  already  making  good  progress.  Cost  estimates \nwere  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  selected  roads,  types  of  intervention,  quantities \nrequired,  and  realistic  unit  costs.  Procurement  will  follow  a  one-stage  one-evelope  procedure \nwith post-qualification. An experienced project implementation office is already in place and will \nimplement the Project. These measures promise to improve project performance substantially.   \n\nIt  streamlines  ADB  processing  without  compromising \n\nimplementation  unit. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25\n\n                                                                                  Costs                                                               Financing \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\n     A               B                 C              D                 E             F \nForeign      Foreign      Local        Local          Total      Total   \nExchange  Exchange  Currency  Currency  (E=A+C)   (F=B+D)      Govt.

Additional  traffic  is  generated  either \nbecause a journey becomes more attractive by virtue of its costing less or because of increased \ndevelopment  brought  about  by  the  improved  roads.  For  all  sections,  the  generated  traffic  was \nassumed to equal 5% of normal traffic that would occur during the first year after rehabilitation \nworks end.

The \neconomic analysis covers 20 years (2006\u20132025) for the upgrade-to-sealed option and 15 years \n(2006\u20132020)  for  re-gravelling,  with  construction  periods  of  between  1  and  2  years  starting  in \n2007. All benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. All prices are expressed in PNG kina. \n \n7. \nIn  the  scenario  without  the  Project,  the  11  subproject  road  sections  are  assumed  to \nreceive a minimum of maintenance to keep them at an average roughness measuring 16 on the \nInternational Roughness Index (IRI). The scenario with the Project includes routine and periodic \nmaintenance.  \n \n8. \nDuring project preparation, two improvement options were considered, namely upgrade-\nto-sealed  and  re-gravelling,  to  determine  which  would  be  the  more  cost-effective.  In  the \nscenario  with  the  Project,  the  average  roughness  would  decrease  to  about  4.5  IRI  after \nupgrading  to  sealed  and  would  keep  road  surface  roughness  below  7  IRI.  In  the  re-gravelling \noption,  the  average  roughness  of  the  road  would  be  reduced  to  6.5  IRI,  and  proposed \nmaintenance would keep road surface roughness below 10 IRI. \n \n \n \nProject  economic  costs  include  the  financial  roadwork  costs  in  terms  of  materials, \n9. \nequipment, labor, and consulting services. Taxes and duties are excluded. Costs were divided \ninto tradable and nontradable components. A standard conversion factor of 0.95 has been used \nto revalue goods and services at world prices into PNG kina, and a shadow wage rate factor of \n0.5  has  been  applied  to  local  unskilled  labor  to  account  for  local  unemployment  and \nunderemployment. These factors have been applied to capital and maintenance costs, as well \nas to vehicle operating and passenger time costs. \n \n\nCosts \n\n2. \n\nBenefits \n\n3. \n \n10. \nBenefits are substantial from the 11 subproject roads because they have relatively high \ntraffic usage due to active agricultural and commercial sectors, and because they are in poor or \nvery poor condition. The main benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs and time for road \nusers, and in maintenance costs. \n \n11. \nVehicle operating costs include the costs of (i) replacing spare parts, (ii) gas and diesel, \n(iii) lubricating oil, (iv) maintenance labor, and (v) crew wages. We used project economic costs \nas inputs to the analysis. \n \n12. \nThe value of time in the economic analysis is derived from two components: (i) working \ntime  and  (ii)  nonworking  time.  The  value  of  working  time  during  productive  hours  was  derived \nfrom the average per capita income of K2,300. Assuming a 48-hour work week and 48 weeks of \nwork  per  year,  the  value  of  a  working  hour  used  in  the  analysis  was  K1.00.  Nonworking  time \nwas valued at a quarter of working time. This rate was used for bus and PMV passengers only. \nThe rate was doubled for passengers in cars and pickups.  \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39\n\n4. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n \n \n13. \nUsing  a  12%  discount rate,  the  economic  benefits  for  the infrastructure  components  of \nthe  Project  are  substantial.

The  analysis  indicates  that \nbenefits  outweigh  costs  for  each  of  the  following  sensitivity  tests:  (i)  increased  rehabilitation \ncosts,  (ii)  reduced  benefits,  (iii)  increased  costs  and  reduced  benefits,  (iv)  delay  in  project \nimplementation by 2 years, and (v) not considering benefits due to generated traffic. \n  \nThe switching value1 for increased rehabilitation costs was determined to be 42.5%, and \n16. \nthe  switching  value  for  decreased  benefits  29.9%.  If  the  only  benefits  considered  are  vehicle \noperating  cost  savings  of  normal  traffic,  the  EIRR  would  decrease  only  slightly  to  18.22%.

PNG\u2019s  human  development  index  has \nimproved since the mid-1970s but only very slowly. In 2005, PNG ranked 137, reflecting alarming economic and social  \ndisparities  in  the  country.  On  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  poverty  index,  PNG  ranks  68  among \ndeveloping countries. PNG's main social indicators, such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates, are \nstill well below the averages for lower middle-income countries. PNG has limited primary healthcare. Infectious disease \nclaims many lives, and there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as malaria and a generalized \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. In education, the rate of participation in primary schooling is improving, but it remains lower than in \nmost other countries in the region. \n \nPNG has an abundance of natural resources including (i) large reserves of minerals, (ii) extensive forestry and fishery \nassets,  (iii)  significant  potential  for  agricultural  expansion,  and  (iv)  many  locations  with  potential  for  ecological  and \ncultural  tourism.  Despite  the  potential  of  these  resources,  PNG's  economic  performance  has  fallen  short  of \nexpectations.  Economic growth  has not kept pace  with population growth, and performance varies  considerably from \nyear  to  year.  Most  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  communities  with  traditional  village  structures  and  depend  on \nsubsistence  farming  supplemented  by  cash  crops.  Only  15\u201320%  live  in  the  main  urban  areas  of  Port  Moresby,  Lae, \nMadang, Mt. Hagan, and Goroka. PNG has a relatively small dual economy, formal and informal. The formal economy \nis dominated by large-scale resource projects, particularly in mining and petroleum, and provides a large proportion of \ngovernment  revenue.  However,  the  formal  sector  employs  only  around  15%  of  the  workforce,  with  the  informal \neconomy supporting the remaining 85%, mostly through semi-subsistence agriculture. \n \nThe  impact  of  road  construction  on  poverty  reduction  can  be  measured  in  terms  of  (i)  increased  access  for  rural \ncommunities to basic social services such as education and healthcare and local markets; (ii) increased employment \nopportunities for unskilled laborers in the project area; (iii) indirect and induced economic growth in the project-affected \nregions  and  the  nation  as  a  whole;  and  (iv)  anticipated  reductions  in  transportation  costs  to  road  passengers,  freight \nusers, and vehicle operators. Local communities clearly perceive that the poor condition of the prioritized road sections \nto be funded under the supplementary loans is a major factor retarding their economic and social development. Most of \nthe roads are now so poor that the availability of both public and private means of transport along them has declined so \nfar  that  most  people  can  no  longer  regularly  access  services  and  markets  in  urban  centers.  There  is  no  doubt  that \nimproving  these  roads  would  greatly  facilitate  access  to  a  wider  range  of  services  and  stimulate  economic  activity, \nespecially  cash  cropping,  and  thus  directly  contribute  to  alleviating  poverty  in  the  target  populations.  Through  the \nproject  performance  monitoring  system,  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  and  monitored \naccording  to  selected  socioeconomic  indicators,  which  include  (i)  economic  activity  and  income  levels  in  the  project \narea;  (ii)  industrial  and  agricultural  outputs;  (iii)  transport  costs  and  time;  (iv)  transport  services  and  charges,  (v) \naccident  rates,  (vi)  degrees  of  access  to  functioning  services,  including  school  enrollment  and  infant  mortality;  (vii) \naccess to information and services regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS; and (viii) jobs \ncreated in road construction and maintenance. Employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled, \npoor, and female laborers. \n \nRehabilitating and upgrading prioritized road sections under the supplementary loans is in line with the Medium Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS)a, which highlights the importance of export-driven economic growth, rural development, \nand poverty reduction, including the promotion of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. Under the MTDS, one of \nthe  mutually  supporting  expenditure  priorities  is  rehabilitating  and  maintaining  transport  infrastructure.  This  is  in  line \nwith  the  priorities  set  forth  in  the  draft  national  poverty  reduction  strategy,  which  is  structured  around  five  pillars:  (i) \nstrengthened  governance,  (ii)  increased  development  of  land  and  natural  resources,  (iii)  improved  and  maintained \nphysical  infrastructure,  (iv)  improved  and  expanded  economic  growth  opportunities,  and  (v)  strengthened  and \nexpanded social services. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                    Proposed Classification: General intervention \n\n \nAccording  to  the  most  recent  census  (2000),  each  of  the  five  provinces  in  the  project  area\u2500which  includes  Northern \nHighlands,  Southern  Highlands,  Eastern  Highlands,  Chimbu,  and  Enga\u2500has  a  population  of  between  300,000  and \n500,000. Extremely  wide ethnic and cultural diversity characterizes all five provinces, as is reflected in the very large \nnumber  of  languages  spoken.  Mutual  hostility  between,  and  often  within,  language  groups  is  the  norm,  and  this  is \nreflected in localized tribal fighting. Despite this high diversity, the traditional way of life of these different groups is very \nsimilar,  as  reflected  in  settlement  patterns,  styles  of  houses,  and  reliance  on  subsistence  economies.  The  Highlands \nsettlement  pattern  is  one  of  isolated  homesteads  or  small,  dispersed  hamlets.  Villages  with  concentrations  of  closely \nspaced houses are uncommon. Almost all of the houses are built from bush materials, i.e., wooden frames with woven \nwalls and thick thatched-grass roofs. Most of the affected people will be subsistence agriculturalists who obtain a small \nincome by selling cash crops such as coffee, vegetables, and peanuts. The crops grown are a mixture of traditional and \nintroduced plants. In most areas, the main crop is sweet potato (kaukau), and commonly more than half of the crop is \nfed to pigs, which are kept as prestige items for ceremonial exchange. Most communities suffer no shortage of garden \nfoods for subsistence consumption. A few people along the roads earn irregular cash income from road maintenance \nworks,  but  the  availability  of  cash  work  has  declined  in  recent  years  as  funds  allocated  to  road  maintenance  have \ndeclined. Workforce, vocational, and business skills are generally weak, especially outside the major towns. The levels \nof literacy and health are very poor. Illiteracy rates in the Highlands are about 67% (compared with a national average \nof 55%), with the women\u2019s illiteracy rate of 75% higher than the male illiteracy rate of 60%. Physical infrastructure in the \nHighlands is inadequate to support economic and social development. The provision of Government education, health, \nand  policing  services  is  very  poor,  especially  in  rural  areas.  Commercial  support  services  such  as  legal  services, \naccounting,  and  marketing  are  limited  outside  the  main  cities.  Law  and  order  problems,  including  tribal  fighting  and \ncrimes such as robbery, murder, assault, and destruction of property, have long been a feature of most parts of modern \nPNG and afflict road users as well as the wider population. The law and order situation in the provinces traversed by \nthe Highlands Highway is grim and reported to be deteriorating. \n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n  Yes               \n\n  No  \n\n \nExtensive  consultations  with  central  and  provincial  governments  and  local  stakeholders  on  the  selection  of  road \nsections were conducted during the loan reconnaissance mission in November 2005. The original list proposed by the \ncentral Government included two roads for each province. While there was a consensus over most of the roads, Enga \nand Chimbu provinces expressed different views. The reconnaissance Mission assessed their requests on the grounds \nof economic and social development, linkage to the ongoing project, project cost, and project readiness, and conducted \nfurther  consultations  with  the  central  Government.  An  agreement  was  obtained  on  the  prioritized  list  of  road \nsubprojects. Iterative consultations by the Highlands Region Maintenance Group (HRMG) community relations officer, \nand  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  team  during  the  loan  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  February  2006,  further \nconfirmed ownership and commitment to the prioritized list from a broad range of stakeholders, including landowners, \ncommunity  leaders,  vehicle  operators,  freight  shippers,  road  constructors,  private  sector  entrepreneurs  and \nshopkeepers,  and  community-based  nongovernment  and  faith-based  organizations.  Stakeholder  analysis  identified \ncritical social and gender issues, and mitigation of anticipated impacts are reflected in the design of the supplementary \nloans. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nCommunities\u2019  participation  and  their  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  is  a  distinctive  feature  of  the \nongoing Project, which will be consistently carried through in the proposed supplementary loans. HRMG\u2019s community \nrelations  officer  has  been  indispensable  in  (i)  ensuring  that  local  villagers  and  landowners  are  fully  appraised  of  any \nwork that may affect them; (ii) seeking villagers\u2019 and landowners\u2019 active support for the roadwork by explaining to them \nand their communities the potential benefits and inherent risks associated with road construction; (iii) mitigating and/or \navoiding  claims  and  disputes;  (iv)  helping  to  resolve  disputes;  and  (v)  ensuring  women\u2019s  adequate  participation  in \nproject  activities  and  their  employment  in  labor-intensive  road  maintenance.  The  proposed  supplementary  loans  will \nbuild on communities\u2019 existing involvement in roadwork and ensure more systematic documentation and incorporation \nof community-related initiatives\u2500with emphasis on women\u2019s participation and involvement in road-related activities\u2500in \nproject  progress  reports  and  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  The  community  initiative  component  to  be \nfunded by the supplementary loans will promote (i) continuous support to community involvement in road maintenance \nand  (ii)  community-based,  gender-responsive  training  on  road  maintenance,  road  safety  (under  the  aegis  of  the \nProvincial Works Administration) and STI/HIV/AIDS prevention (under the aegis of the Provincial Works Administration, \nin consultation with Provincial AIDS Council and Health Administration). \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n43\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn the Highlands\u2019 project area, women are currently involved in a broad range of activities related to road construction \nand maintenance and commercial roadsite services. The supplementary loans will build on critical lessons learned from \nLoan  1709-PNG  and  proactively  support  women\u2019s  and  women  groups\u2019  manifested  interest  in  the  employment  and \nbusiness  opportunities  associated  with  project  road  construction  and  maintenance.  The  two-pronged  approach  to \nmaximize impacts on women will involve the following: \n\nAdoption  of  employment  targets  to  support  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation,  upgrading,  and \nmaintenance.

Under  the  PNG \nenvironmental  assessment \nthe  Environment  Act  2000, \nframework \ncomplemented with the Prescribed Activities Regulation [Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2002]), \nupgrading and rehabilitating existing provincial road sections are categorized as level 1 and do \nnot require formal approval (i.e., an environmental permit) from the Department of Environment \nand  Conservation  (DEC). 2 Under  the  ADB  guidelines,  the  supplementary  loans  have  been \ncategorized as environmental category B. Initial environmental examination (IEE) reports have \nbeen  prepared  for  the  11  proposed  road  sections  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003) and comply with the ADB Environment Policy.  \n \nB. \n \nSupplementary loans will finance the upgrading and rehabilitation of 11 additional road \n2. \nsections with a total length of 270 km in the five Highlands provinces. The total cost is estimated \nat  $76.27  million.  The  design  for  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  will  follow  the  Department  of \nWorks  (DOW)  Road  Design  Manual.  The  proposed  horizontal  and  vertical  alignments  will \nclosely  follow  existing  alignments,  requiring  minimal  earthworks.  However,  the  pavement \nreservation  defined  in  the  Road  Design  Manual  was  modified  in  specific  locations  to  reduce \nadverse  environmental \nimpacts  and  construction  costs.  Construction  works  will  entail \n(i) removing vegetation immediately adjacent to the road (within the right of way), (ii) excavating \nand  disposing  of  unsuitable  material  from  road  shoulders  and  cuttings,  (iii)  placing  and \ncompacting granular base, and (iv) sealing selected road sections. Existing pipe culverts will be \nrehabilitated  and  retained,  and  new  headwalls  and  aprons  provided  as  necessary.  Additional \ntransverse culverts are required to improve drainage of the road area. Additionally, longitudinal \nculverts and/or shallow drains will be provided to facilitate access to adjoining homesteads and \ncommercial developments. Most of the 52 bailey and steel girder bridges will require only minor \nrepairs. \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \nThe proposed road sections are located in the mountainous region of PNG known as the \n3. \nHighlands. Numerous, sometimes large, valleys at 1,100\u20131,800 meters above sea level (masl) \nare  divided by  often  steep  and  rugged  ranges  of  hills  and mountains, which  reach  altitudes  in \nmany place of more than 3,000 masl. Small earthquakes and heavy rainfall are responsible for \nmany deteriorated sections of all national and rural roads, particularly in Eastern Highlands and \nChimbu  provinces.  There  is  a  marked  increase  in  the  annual  rainfall  from  the  eastern  and \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Papua \n\nNew Guinea for the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project. Manila (approved on 16 November). \n\n2  However, a permit will be required if roadwork involves level 2 activities. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45\n\nsouthern  parts  (1,280  and  2,880  millimeters/year,  respectively)  toward  the  central  parts  of  the \nHighlands (more than 3,000 millimeters/year).  \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n4. \nIn  the  Highlands,  almost  all  of  the  area  below  the  effective  upper  limit of  cultivation,  at \nabout  2,400  masl,  is  covered  with  a  mosaic  of  gardens,  tree  crops  (especially  coffee), \ngrasslands and shrub lands, groves of useful timber trees, and patches of regrowth forest. Many \nhills and ridge tops had little gardening in the past, and dense regrowth forests of mid-montane \ntrees remain. Where forests survive, they are used for hunting, mainly using traditional methods. \nNone  of  the  proposed  road  sections  traverses  an  environmentally  sensitive  area.  No  forestry \nconcessions  exist  in  any  areas  accessible  from  the  roads  currently  under  consideration  for \nrehabilitation and upgrading. \n \n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n \nIn 2000, the five provinces comprising the Highlands had a total population of almost 2 \n5. \nmillion people, about 40% of the total PNG population. The population of the districts where the \nroad  sections  are  located  was  approximately  884,000.  Most  of  the  beneficiaries  in  the  target \narea are subsistence agriculturalists who obtain a small income by selling cash crops such as \ncoffee,  vegetables,  and  peanuts.  Local  residents  sell  their  produce  to  other  locals  and  the \ntraveling public. Most of the markets are established within the right of way, but generally there \nare no fixed structures close to the road.  \n \n\n4. \n\nQuality of Life Values and the Sociocultural Environment \n\n \n6. \nExtremely  wide  ethnic  and  cultural  diversity  characterizes  the  Highlands,  which  is \nreflected in the several hundreds of languages spoken there. Mutual hostility between language \ngroups  is  the  norm,  bringing  localized  tribal  fighting.  About  97%  of  the  land  remains  in \ncustomary collective ownership, though this does not give any clear guarantee of tenure. Land \nis not regarded as a commodity that can be bought and sold by individuals, but as a permanent \nand  integral  part  of  a  village  community.  The  complex  land  tenure  arrangement  is  also  a \nconstraint on the state's ability to impose statutory law over customary law. \n \nD. \n \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n \n7. \nLocal  communities  may  benefit  from  the  improved  road  conditions  through  (i)  reduced \ndust  nuisance,  (ii)  improved  drainage  along  the  road,  (iii)  improved  land  stability  at  filled-up \nlocations,  and  (iv)  improved  mobility  and  health.  Proceeds  from  increased  employment  and \neconomic  opportunities  may  subsequently  be  invested  in  improving  communities\u2019  living  and \nenvironmental conditions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDesign and/or Preconstruction Phase Considerations \n\n \n8. \nDuring  the  design  and  preconstruction  phase,  ample  attention  has  been  given  to \nintegrating  concerns  related  to  (i)  potential  adverse  impacts  on  protected  or  environmental \nsensitive areas (mitigated by ensuring that none of the proposed road sections will traverse or \nimpact  such  areas);  (ii)  the  application  of  appropriate  technical  solutions  to  address  higher \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\noccurrence  of  landslides  and  subsequent  erosion  risks,  especially  in  Chimbu  and  Eastern \nHighlands  provinces;  (iii)  safety  issues  by  limiting  the  expected  speed  increase  on  the  road \nsections;  (iv)  cultural  sites  (by  describing  procedures  to  be  followed  for  ceremonial  and  burial \nsites along the road section); and (v) other social and community concerns, as also experienced \nwhile implementing Loan 1709-PNG.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  Measures  during  the  Construction \nPhase \n\n \n9. \nConstruction  works  will  result  in  limited  temporary  adverse  environmental  impacts,  but \nthey  can  be  minimized  by  ensuring  proper  construction  practices  and  adequate  compliance \nmonitoring.  Some  of  the  key  environmental  impacts  that  have  been  identified  and  their \nmitigation measures are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nClearing  vegetation  and  excavation  works  may  result  in  erosion  and  loss  of \nsediments, which will be mitigated by minimizing soil and vegetation clearance.  \nChanges  in  drainage  patterns  may  cause  obstruction  of  storm  water  flow  and \nincreased flooding and siltation, which will be mitigated by controlling storm water \nand drainage. \nNoise and dust will increase along the roadsides during roadwork, which will be \nmitigated by spraying exposed surfaces during dry periods, proper maintenance \nof equipment, and careful selection and management of quarries. \nHealth and safety risks will be mitigated by ensuring all occupational health and \nsafety requirements in place on construction sites and work camps. \nPollution  from  waste  disposal  will  be  mitigated  by  adequate  offsite  and  waste \nmanagement, satisfying safety and health concerns. \nThe residual impact from decommissioning construction sites will be mitigated by \nsatisfactory decommissioning procedures.  \n\nA  more  complete  list  of  environmental  impact  and  mitigation  measures  is  presented  in  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans (EMMP). \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  Measures  during  the  Operational \nPhase \n\n \n10. \nEnvironmental  impacts  during  the  operational  phase  will  be  mainly  noise,  dust,  and \nvehicle  emissions  affecting  air  quality,  as  well  as  traffic  accidents.  The  noise  impact  is \nconsidered low because (i) the volume of traffic is quite low, (ii) there are few heavy vehicles on \nthe  road,  (iii)  vehicles  will  move  slowly  because  of  speed  restrictions;  and  (iv)  noise  from \nindividual  vehicles  will  be  lower  on  sealed  sections  than  on  the  existing  gravel.  Air  quality \nimpacts from vehicle emissions will be low also because of low traffic volumes and is not likely \nto have significant health impacts. An increased risk of traffic accidents will be mitigated through \n(i)  speed  reduction  measures  (e.g.,  installing  speed  bumps  at  settlements,  schools,  and \nmarkets),  (ii)  off-road  boarding  areas  for  PMVs,  (iii)  improved  road  signage  and  pavement \nmarkings, and (iv) consultations and awareness campaigns with local communities. \n \n\n5. \n\nCumulative Impacts \n\n \n11. \nNo  significant  cumulative  impacts  from  the  supplementary  loans  have  been  identified. \nThe  most  likely  cumulative  impacts  are  general,  related  to  increased  economic  activity  in  the \nHighlands. However, none of these is considered significant. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\n6. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n \n12. \nThe findings and proposed mitigation measures for each subproject have been compiled \ninto an EMMP included in the IEE reports. Where appropriate, implementation details will need \nto  be  elaborated  and  updated  and  will  be  subject  to  review  as  part  of  the  bidding  evaluation \nprocedures. Mitigation measures and a monitoring plan have been prepared and discussed with \nDEC (a summary is included in Table A.10). The total cost of implementing the monitoring plan \nduring  the  construction  phase  is  estimated  at  K75,000  per  year.3 Monitoring  costs  during  the \noperations  phase  is  estimated  at  K1,000/year/road  section.  A  monitoring  checklist,  based  on  \nEMMP, will be used in the field for monitoring and reporting. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nAs  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  supplementary  loans,  DOW  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  EMMP.  Day-to-day  implementation  and  compliance \nmonitoring will be the task of the environment officer of the HRMG, under the supervision of the \nfield project manager and supported by the provincial field supervision engineers. The findings \nof  regular  monitoring  activities,  as  specified  in  the  monitoring  plan,  will  be  included  in  the \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB.  These  will  include  (i)  an  overview  of  the \nstatus  of  EMMP  preparation  and  (ii)  compliance  with  completed  EMMP.  The  progress  reports \nwill  be  submitted  for  information  to  DEC  and  ADB,  with  copies  provided  to  the  DOW \nenvironment coordinator in Port Moresby. Compliance with EMMP will be subject to assessment \nby review missions from ADB and/or DEC and included in the project completion report. \n \nHRMG staff members have gained the necessary experience in compliance monitoring \n14. \nduring the implementation of Loan 1709-PNG. Combined with improved project procedures and \nthe  additional  capacity  building  and  quality  control  to  be  provided  by  the  implementation \nconsultants,  the  capacity  of  HRMG  to  carry  out  compliance  monitoring  and  reporting  is \nconsidered  adequate.  Because  anticipated  environmental  impacts  are  limited  and  monitoring \ntechniques are straightforward, no further specific training activities are required. \n \nF. \n \n15. \nDuring  January  and  February  2006,  consultations  were  held  with  local  communities  in \nthe  affected  districts  and  government  officials  in  provincial  capitals  in  the  Highlands  and  Port \nMoresby.  The  findings  of  the  consultations  along  nine  proposed  road  sections4 confirm  strong \noverall  support  and  willingness  to  cooperate  with  HRMG  and  contractors  in  implementing  the \nsubprojects. Support from provincial governments has been demonstrated through their active \ninvolvement \nlocal \ncommunities  during  the  current  subprojects  of  Loan  1709-PNG.  Since  2000,  the  provincial \ngovernments  of  Chimbu,  Western  Highlands,  Eastern  Highlands,  and  Enga  have  signed \nagreements  with  community  representatives  on  implementation  arrangements  for  the  various \nHRMG subprojects.  \n \nDocumented support for the individual subprojects and pledged cooperation with HRMG \n16. \nare included in the separate IEE reports. Beneficiary consultations will be continued throughout \nthe  preparation  and  construction  phases.

In \nparticular, the proposed subprojects are not located in environmentally sensitive or conservation \nareas,  will  not  increase  logging  or  hunting,  and  are  strongly  supported  and  requested  by  the \nlocal communities. No significant associated or cumulative impacts are identified. Therefore, a \nmore  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  warranted,  and  the  IEEs  will  be \ncompleted as the final environment assessment documents of the Project.  \n \nH. \n \n18. \nThe  initial  environmental  screening  process  and  analysis  of  potential  environmental \nimpacts lead to the conclusion that the proposed subprojects are unlikely to result in any direct, \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  scope  of  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  the \nproposed  road  sections,  and  their  anticipated  environmental  impacts,  are  of  a  magnitude  that \ndoes  not  require  further  study.  As  listed  in  the  environmental  management  plan,  all  potential \nenvironmental concerns can be properly mitigated. Consequently, the environmental monitoring \nplan (Table A.10) provides sufficient guidance for HRMG to successfully monitor and report on \nenvironmental compliance during subproject implementation.  \n\nConclusions \n\n\fTable A.10:  Summary Mitigation Measures and Environmental Monitoring Plan  \n\nLocation \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nVerification \n\nSocial or Community \nConcerns \n\nPotential road \nalignment and quarry \nsites \n\nSoil Instability and \nErosion \n\nAll areas where \nclearing is required \n\nPlan activities to minimize displacement of \nresidents, discuss the projected impacts, \nnegotiate proposed measures in advance \nwith the affected community, and work with \nlocal government officers and NGOs. \nReduce the time surfaces remain bare.
