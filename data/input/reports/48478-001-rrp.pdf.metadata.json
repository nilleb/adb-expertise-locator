It builds on earlier reforms, \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners, to improve \npublic  financial  management  (PFM)  and  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  performance,  and  to \nestablish the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund (NTF) to save unexpected gains, or windfalls, \nin public revenue for the future. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  context. Nauru  is  ADB\u2019s  smallest  member  country  and  one  of  the  most \nremote  islands  in  the  world.  It  is  a  single  island  of  21  square  kilometers  with  a  population  of \nabout  10,800,  concentrated  along  a  narrow  coastal  belt.  There  is  little  potential  for  agriculture \nand the country is heavily dependent on imports for basic necessities. While Nauru possesses \ntwo  significant  natural  resources\u2014phosphate  deposits  and  the  oceanic  resources  of  its \nexclusive  economic  zone\u2014opportunities  for  diversification  are  limited.  Remoteness  and \ndiseconomies  of  scale  translate  into  high  operating  costs,  which  limit  opportunities  for  private \nenterprise  and  domestic  job  creation,  and  hamper  efforts  to  deliver  basic  public  services.  The \npublic  sector  dominates  the  economy  and  employment.  Nauruan  institutions  are  thinly \nresourced  and  relatively  weak,  with  a  high  dependence  on  foreign  advisors.  Overall \ndevelopment progress has been mixed.2 Education and health outcomes have improved during \n2013\u20132015  but  are  still  poor  by  international  standards.  An  estimated  24%  of  the  population \nlives below the basic needs poverty line.3 \n \n4. \nRecent economic and fiscal performance. After suffering an economic collapse in the \nlate  1990s  to  early  2000s,  Nauru\u2019s  economy  began  to  recover  in  2007  and  since  then,  the \ncountry\u2019s per capita income has recovered much lost ground. Gross national income per capita \nis  estimated  at  A$15,641  (fiscal  year  [FY]2014).  Phosphate  exports  resumed  in  2007  and  the \nRegional  Processing  Centre  (RPC)  for  asylum  seekers  (operated  under  a  bilateral  agreement \nwith  the  Government  of  Australia)  was  reopened  in  2012,  having  first  operated  during  2001\u2013\n2007. The RPC has contributed to a surge in local economic activity, domestic employment, and \ngovernment  revenues  (including  direct  payments  to  the  state  budget  under  a  bilateral \nagreement). 4  Government  finances  have  also  benefited  from  windfall  fishing  license  fee \nrevenues  (due  to  higher  fee  rates  under  a  regional  arrangement 5),  while  payments  to  local \nlandowners for the liquidation of the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust (NPRT) since 2013 have \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Government of Nauru. 2012.

Unpublished. \n\n4   The bilateral agreement covers the period 2015\u20132019 with the possibility for a 5-year extension. \n5  Nauru receives and sells an annual allocation of fishing vessel days under the Vessel Day Scheme, operated under \nthe  Parties  to  the  Nauru  Agreement,  which  comprises  eight  Pacific  Island  countries.  Increased  fees  reflect  high \nmarket demand while the scheme caps the supply of vessel days to protect the sustainability of regional fisheries.   \n\n \n\n\ffurther  added  to  aggregate  demand.6 These  positive  developments raised  economic growth  to \n19.5% on average during FY2012\u2013FY2014, while domestic revenue tripled in nominal terms.  \n \n5. \nThe windfall revenue has been directed toward increased expenditure and improving the \ngovernment\u2019s balance sheet (Table 1).7 Personnel, goods and services, and special projects\u2014\nincluding  programs  for  school  feeding,  community  works,  and  community  housing\u2014have \nabsorbed the majority of increased spending. Fuel subsidy costs have been kept in check, with \nthe elimination of retail fuel subsidies in FY2015, but remain a large share of the budget due to \ncontinued  fuel  subsidies  for  the  state-owned  power  company.  The  government  has  targeted \nbalanced budgets on a cash flow basis. Public debt has fallen 23.7% since FY2012. \n \n6. \nIn  FY2015,  damage to the  port  mooring facility, Nauru\u2019s main gateway  for  international \ncargo, caused real  GDP  to  contract  by  an  estimated  10.0%,  with  phosphate  exports falling  by \ntwo-thirds. The mooring system is structurally vulnerable to damage and has typically received \nonly ad hoc repairs. Inflation also jumped due to the disruption to inbound supplies coupled with \nstrong demand growth, the elimination of retail fuel subsidies, and a falling Australian dollar (the \nlocal  currency).  Despite  these  setbacks,  Nauru\u2019s  income  remains  at  a  high  level  by  historical \nstandards  and  the  economy  is  expected  to  recover  strongly  in  FY2017  when  the  mooring \nsystem is expected to be fully restored.  \n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Nauru Macro-Fiscal Performance and Outlook, FY2013\u2013FY2016 \n\nItem \n\nFY2013 \n\nFY2014 \n\nFY2015 (e) \n\nFY2016 (f) \n\n17.5 \n3.0 \n2.3 \n20.3 \n87.4 \n \n17.5 \n8.1 \n22.7 \n9.9 \n4.4 \n5.4 \n130.4 \n\n3.0 \n6.6 \n0.1 \n12.6 \n82.2 \n \n24.7 \n8.2 \n2.1 \n18.6 \n17.0 \n9.0 \n111.6 \n\n-10.0 \n11.4 \n0.1 \n10.5 \n95.6 \n \n24.2 \n9.2 \n5.2 \n18.5 \n8.0 \n4.3 \n118.0 \n\nReal GDP (% change) \n15.4 \nInflation (%) \n0.5 \nBudget balance (% of GDP) \n0.3 \n  Adjusted balancea \n12.6 \nTotal revenue ($ million) \n59.8 \nSelected expenses (% of total revenue): \n \n  Personnel costs  \n21.9 \n  Net fuel expensesb  \n16.4 \n  Debt repayments  \n14.6 \n  Goods and services (excl. fuel) \n10.2 \n  Special projectsc  \n5.2 \n  NTF set-aside  \n0.0 \n114.3 \nNominal GDP ($ million) \n(e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, NTF = Nauru Intergenerational Trust \nFund.  \na Budget balance, excluding financing items.  \nb Fuel purchases and fuel subsidies to a power utility, less fuel sales. \nc Special projects in the Government of Nauru chart of accounts plus the Community Housing Scheme. \nSource: Government of Nauru budget documents (various years) and Asian Development Bank staff estimates and \nprojections. \n \nGovernment  development  strategy.

The remaining NPRT assets could provide up to \na further A$30 million in liquidation payments. \n\n7   Economic and Fiscal Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nNauruans.\u201d 8  The  current  government\u2019s  economic  reform  strategy  is  based  on  the  National \nSustainable Development Strategy and focuses on achieving the long-term goals of (i) a stable, \ntrustworthy,  fiscally  responsible  government;  (ii)  provision  of  enhanced  social,  infrastructure, \nand utility services; and (iii) development of an economy based on multiple sources of revenue. \n\n \n8. \nPolicy  challenges.  The  overarching  challenge  facing  Nauru  is  to  effectively  manage \nwindfall  income  to  build  a  sustainable  economic  future.  Nauru\u2019s  heavy  reliance  on  uncertain \nwindfall revenues (Table 2) gives rise to concerns about long-term sustainability, the quality of \npublic expenditure, and macroeconomic stability. RPC-related income remains highly uncertain, \nwhile collections from customs and excise duties and the new employment and services tax are \nalso sensitive to RPC-related developments. Fisheries and phosphate revenues face high short-\nrun volatility, and phosphate reserves are expected to be exhausted in the next 20 years. \n \n\nTable 2: Sources of Revenue Uncertainty \n(% of domestic revenuea, unless otherwise stated) \n\nItem  \n\nFY2015 (e)  FY2016 (f) \n\nIssues \n\n \n\n0.9 \n\n3.8 \n\n68.1 \n\n73.2 \n\n32.1 \n21.6 \n19.9 \n6.0 \n\n25.3 \n30.5 \n16.8 \n10.1 \n\nShort-run volatility, finite reserves \n\nShort-run volatility, uncertain sustainability \nShort life span, risk of sudden cessation \nSensitive to level of RPC activity  \nMost taxpayers are linked to RPC \n\nFishing license fees \nRPC-related payments \nCustoms and excise duties \nEmployment and services tax \nPhosphate royalties and \ndividends \nDomestic revenuea ($ millions) \n(e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, RPC = Regional Processing Centre. \na Net of fuel sales and reimbursable RPC-related costs. \nSource: Government of Nauru budget documents (various years) and Asian Development Bank staff estimates and \nassessment. \n \nTo  achieve  greater  intergenerational  equity  and  fiscal  sustainability,  a  large  portion  of \n9. \nwindfall revenues need to be saved for the future. High inflation at present shows the limits to \neffectively  absorbing  significant  fiscal  expansion.  Acute  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  including \nNauru\u2019s inadequate and damaged port facilities and unreliable and inefficient power supply, are \na  critical  supply-side  constraint.  PFM  deficiencies,  particularly  weak  expenditure  controls  and \nproblematic cash management, further undermine the returns to scaled-up public spending. The \npotential for negative revenue shocks, both short-term and permanent, is also a major concern. \nNauru  has  no  access to  debt financing,  which  means  careful fiscal  planning  within  a  medium-\nterm perspective is required to maintain adequate fiscal buffers. Broadening the revenue base \nto improve fiscal stability and sustainability is a priority.  \n \n10. \nPublic  financial  management.  In  2011,  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  helped  the \ngovernment  to  develop  and  adopt  a  PFM  action  plan  to  guide  its  reform  efforts  during  2011\u2013\n2015 and coordinate support from development partners.9 The action plan focused on achieving \na  basic  overall  PFM  system  as  soon  as  practically  possible.  Considerable  progress  has  been \nmade,  including  (i)  the  introduction  of  a  fully  automated  financial  management  information \nsystem  (FMIS),  Technology  One,  to  replace  the  existing  manual  system;  and  (ii)  the \nestablishment  of  a  public  procurement  policy  that  outsources  all  government  and  SOE \nprocurement for items over A$5,000 (except bulk fuel procurement, which has been privatized). \n\n                                                \n8   Government of Nauru. 2005.

Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  Governance  and  Accountability  in  Pacific  Island  Countries \n\n(Phase 2). Manila (TA 6499 REG). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe  government  also  undertook  reforms  to  broaden  the  revenue  base,  including  establishing \nthe Nauru Revenue Office in 2011, introducing a new revenue administration act in 2014, and \nadopting a new tax policy framework in 2014 which identified several new tax measures to be \nintroduced in stages over the coming years. While progress has been made on several fronts, a \nconsiderable  medium-term  agenda  remains.  In  the  near  term,  the  priority  is  to  further \noperationalize  the  FMIS,  strengthen  expenditure  controls,  improve  cash  management,  move \ntoward medium-term budgeting, and introduce new revenue-raising measures. \n \nUtilities  reform.  Subsidized  power  provision  is  a  major  fiscal  burden,  while  power \n11. \nprovision remains unreliable and system efficiency remains low.  10  Weak management and the \nuse  of  outdated  and  inefficient  diesel  generators  have  been  critical  issues.11 Addressing  this \nsituation  will  reduce  fiscal  costs,  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  government  operations,  and  improve  the  delivery  of  basic  services  to \nhouseholds.  Recent  reforms  have  helped  to  improve  service  delivery,  and  power  outages  are \nnow  reported  to  be  less  frequent  and  generally  scheduled.  The  Nauru  Utilities  Corporation \n(NUC) was corporatized in 2011 and a new chief executive officer was appointed in 2012 on a \nperformance-based contract. Power tariffs were also increased to better reflect economic cost. \nThese  reforms  need  to  be  deepened  and  built  upon  by  extending  the  performance-based \nmanagement  system,  strengthening  financial  management,  and  ensuring  proper  asset \nmaintenance. 12  Comprehensive  tariff  reform  to  move  toward  greater  cost  recovery  while \nbalancing equity concerns is also vital to sustainability. \n \n12. \nNauru  Intergenerational  Trust  Fund.  Large  windfall  revenues,  limited  scope  for \nsustained economic growth, and heavy dependence on development assistance suggest that a \ntrust fund arrangement can help in achieving a sustainable economic future. 13 As also happens \nin a number of other Pacific countries, such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, trust funds can play a major \nrole in economic stability and fiscal management. The government has sought to establish the \nNTF  since  2009.  While  originally  intended  to  provide  a  mechanism  for  saving  and  investing \nphosphate income for the long term, it has since become a critical necessity for saving broader \nand  much  larger  windfall  revenues,  including  those  from  the  RPC  and  fisheries.  The \ngovernment  has  also  sought  bilateral  development  partners  to  join  the  fund  as  contributing \nmembers  to  help  build  its  principal  value  and  ensure  the  fund  is  well  governed.  ADB  TA  has \nbeen helping to ensure the NTF is well designed to avoid the pitfalls of Nauru\u2019s experience with \nthe NPRT.14 Poor governance, weak management, lack of professional investment advice, and \nabsence  of  transparency  saw  the  NPRT  experience  severe  financial  losses  while  the \ngovernment simultaneously engaged in unsustainable borrowing against the fund\u2019s assets. \n \n13. \nThe NTF will be governed by a committee that includes the government and the original \ncontributing  governments. 15  The  NTF  itself  is  to  be  based  in  Australia  and  all  service \nproviders\u2014including  the  custodial  bank,  investment  advisors,  accountant,  and  auditor\u2014are  to \nbe  registered  in  Australia  and  subject  to  supervision  and  regulation  from  Australian  regulatory \n                                                \n10   Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11   An  ADB  project  grant,  with  cofinancing  from  the  European Union  and  Government  of  Australia,  will  finance  two \nfuel-efficient generators.

Provisions such as restricting the type of investments that can be made (to be approved \nby  the  governing  committee)  and  prohibiting  any  borrowing  against  the  assets  of  the  NTF  are \nalso  made  to  prevent  other  historical  mistakes  and  abuses.  The  NTF  will  also  be  required  to \nproduce audited financial statements and undergo regular performance reviews. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition,  lessons  learned,  and  program  modality.  The  goals  of  the \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy are consistent with ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach, \n2015  and  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018  for  Nauru. 16 ADB  support  is \nclosely  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  key  policy  challenges.  ADB\u2019s  2012 \nPublic  Financial  Management  Reform  Program,  the  first  policy-based  operation  in  Nauru, \nsupported key reforms closely related to the proposed program, including the introduction of the \nFMIS; the establishment of a new public procurement system; the adoption of the new tax policy \nframework;  and  the  undertaking  of  key  reforms  for  SOEs,  including  the  NUC.17 ADB  TA  has \nsupported  the  design  and  establishment  of  the  NTF  (footnote  14).  ADB  project  assistance  is \nproviding  new,  more  efficient  power  generators  for  the  NUC  and  ADB  TA  is  supporting \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  tariff  reform  (footnote  12).  Future  ADB  project  assistance  is \nfocusing on developing a new, more resilient and higher capacity port. ADB activities have been \nclosely coordinated with Nauru\u2019s other key development partners, notably the Pacific Financial \nTechnical  Assistance  Centre  and  the  Government  of  Australia. 18  The  latter  also  provides \nsupport to improve the delivery of social services, a key complement to the program. \n \n15. \nThe policy matrix fully supports the government\u2019s policy agenda and is supported by all \nof  Nauru\u2019s  major  development  partners,  including  the  Government  of  Australia.  The  policy \nactions are part of an ongoing reform agenda and policy dialogue between the government and \nits development partners, including ADB. The program has sought to incorporate lessons from \nADB\u2019s  experience  with  policy-based  lending  in  the  Pacific,  including  (i)  ensuring  reforms  are \npolitically  as  well  as  technically  feasible,  (ii)  avoiding  complexity  and  excessive  use  of \nconditionality,  (iii)  responding  to reform  opportunities,  and  (iv)  combining TA  with  policy-based \noperations for complex and politically sensitive reforms.19  \n \n16. \nADB proposes a stand-alone policy-based operation that requires all policy actions to be \naccomplished before grant effectiveness. Disbursement will be conditional upon the opening of \nthe  NTF  account  at  a  designated  custodian  bank  based  in  Australia  and  after  the government \nhas made its own initial contribution to the NTF account. In this way the program will help the \ngovernment to secure its full initial contribution to the NTF in the context of a tight fiscal situation. \nWhile  there  is  broad  political  commitment  in  Nauru  to  having  a  trust  fund,  short-term  political \nrealities  imply  that  contributions  to  the  NTF  can  be  vulnerable  to  pressures  for  increased \ngovernment  spending.  Demonstrating  its commitment,  the government  has  set  aside funds for \nthe  NTF  in  the  FY2016  budget  as  well  as  the  preceding  two  fiscal  years.  This  amounts  to \nA$20.4 million in total or 18% of estimated total revenue in FY2016. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nprogram outcome will be improved fiscal sustainability. \n\nThe program impact will be an improved sustainable quality of life for all Nauruans.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nC. \n \n18. \nThe program will consolidate and build upon earlier reforms supported by ADB in PFM, \nSOE  performance,  and  fiscal  policy  management.  The  three  outputs  encompass  nine  policy \nactions,  all  of  which  have  been  accomplished.    The  accomplishment  of  all  policy  actions  are \nconditions to effectiveness. These are set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4) along with future \nreform priorities that will be included in post-program monitoring. \n \nOutput  1:  Improved  public  financial  management.  The  program  has  supported  the \n19. \ncontinuation of reforms begun in 2012 to improve budget execution and financial controls and to \nmobilize domestic revenue. Much progress has been made, but weak expenditure controls and \nproblematic  cash  management  practices  continue  to  undermine  overall  expenditure  quality. \nWeak controls have constrained the ability of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to ensure that funds \nare  spent  as  budgeted,  while  problematic  cash  management  has  undermined  operational \nefficiency and further distorted the pattern of public spending. The budget has also continued to \noperate  without  a  medium-term  perspective,  a  critical  weakness  given  the  uncertain  and \nvulnerable nature of Nauru\u2019s public finances. A medium-term fiscal framework is needed to help \nthe  government  achieve  an  appropriate  balance  between  consumption  spending,  productive \ninvestment,  and  public  saving  for  both  the  long  and  short  term  i.e.,  building  a  fiscal  buffer \n(footnote  7).  Following  earlier  revenue  reforms, a  nonresident  employment  and services  tax  is \nthe  first  new  tax  measure  to  be  introduced  as  envisioned  under  the  government\u2019s  tax  policy \nframework. \n \n20. \n\nThe MOF has implemented five policy actions under output 1: \n(i)  Output  1.1.  The  accounts  payable  and  bank  reconciliation  functions  of  the  FMIS \nwere made fully functional in October 2015 and March 2016 respectively. This allows \nthe  government  to  minimize  arrears  in  recurrent  spending  and  advance  accounts, \nand improve timeliness and completion of financial statements. \n\n(ii)  Output 1.2. Quarterly financial progress reports were produced and submitted to the \nfinance minister in November 2015. This allows the government to improve financial \nreporting with commitments shown and minimize extrabudgetary expenditure. \n\n(iii) Output 1.3. Weekly in-year budget reports that include cash flow budget statements \nwere  produced  and  made  available  to  all  ministries  in  February  2015,  helping  to \nreduce overexpenditure and improve cash flow forecasting and monitoring. \n\n(iv) Output  1.4.  Aggregate  revenue  and  expenditure  projections  for  FY2016\u2013FY2018 \nwere  prepared  in  November  2015.  These  allow  the  government  to  improve  the \nannual  budget  process  and  prepare  multiyear  budget  forecasts  that  are  linked  to \nsector and infrastructure investment strategies. \n\n(v)  Output  1.5. The Nonresident  Employment  and Services  Tax  Bill  came  into force  in \nSeptember 2014. In FY2015 the tax is estimated to have generated A$5.4 million in \nrevenue. The FY2016 budget targets A$10.4 million in collections. \n\n \n21. \nOutput 2: Efficient service delivery by the Nauru Utilities Corporation. The program \nsupported the deepening of reforms at the NUC. The NUC was further commercialized through \nthe development of a business strategy and the extension of an integrated performance-based \nmanagement  system  for  all  staff.  While  NUC  preventive  maintenance  practices  have  been \ninadequate,  with maintenance  carried  out  on  an  emergency  or  ad  hoc  basis, the situation  has \nbeen improving since April 2014 with the appointment of a new generation manager, funded by \nthe Government of Australia. Financial management capabilities were strengthened through the \nintroduction  of  an  FMIS.  While  an  asset  inventory  was  introduced,  additional  improvements \nwere required, particularly to integrate the fixed assets register with the fixed asset management \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nmodule  under the  NUC\u2019s  new  FMIS.  The  development  of  an  asset maintenance  plan  will  help \nfoster  improved  financial  and  operational  efficiency  and  will  be  important  as  the  NUC \nundertakes  new  capital  investment,  through  an  ADB  project  grant,  to  install  additional,  more \nefficient  diesel  generators  (footnote  11).  Effective  financial  information  and  costing  for  asset \nmaintenance  will  enable  the  government,  with  support  from  ADB  TA,  to  develop  an  informed \napproach to planned tariff reform (footnote 12). \n \n22. \n\nTwo policy actions implemented by the NUC are supported under output 2: \n(i)  Output  2.1.  An  NUC  strategic  plan  was  developed  and  the  following  were \n\nimplemented: \n(a)  A performance-based management system was applied to all employees, linking \n\nemployee performance to the achievement of the NUC business strategy. \n\n(b)  Mind  Your  Own  Business  financial  accounting  software  was  introduced,  which \ncaptures  all  transactions  and  records  them  under  the  appropriate  budget \nheadings, and produces timely and credible management reports. \n\n(c)  A  short-term  program  for  asset  rehabilitation  was  developed  to  upgrade  the \n\nhigh-voltage power network. \n\n(ii)  Output  2.2.  A  strategic  maintenance  plan  for  NUC  assets  was  developed  and \nadopted  to  provide  for  the  maintenance  and  upgrade  of  NUC\u2019s  power  distribution \nnetwork, metering equipment, and water production and delivery. \n\n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Improved  funding  mechanism  for  future  service  delivery.  The  program \nsupported the establishment of the NTF as a mechanism for saving windfall revenues. The NTF \nwas  established  through  the  signing  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the \ngovernments of Nauru and Australia. The specific purpose of the NTF is to build up a sufficient \nprincipal  value\u2014through  financial  contributions  and  a  long-term  investment  strategy\u2014that  can \nprovide  a  future  stream  of  public  revenue  to  support  investments  in  education,  health, \nenvironment,  and  public  infrastructure.  The  intention  is  for  there  to  be  a  buildup  phase, \nprospectively  to  FY2033,  before  the  NTF  enters  a  distribution  phase. 20 Specific  frameworks \nunder  the  NTF  agreement  govern  government  contributions  during  the  buildup  phase  and \nmaximum  NTF  distributions  during \nthe  distribution  phase  (footnote  13).  Government \ncontributions will be based on realized domestic revenue in the preceding year, with the share \ncontributed  rising  with  revenue  levels  to  reflect  intergenerational  equity  principles.  Annual \ndistributions from the NTF will be determined by the committee but will be subject to a formula-\nbased maximum intended to help preserve the principle value of the fund in perpetuity. \n \nThe government has demonstrated its commitment by setting aside A$20.4 million as its \n24. \ninitial contribution to the NTF, including A$5.0 million each in FY2014 and FY2015, and A$10.4 \nmillion  in  FY2016.  The  Government  of  Australia  has  committed  an  initial  contribution  of  A$5.0 \nmillion  (inclusive  of  A$2.5  million  cofinancing  for  the  program)  and  intends  to  contribute  up  to \nA$2.5  million  annually  thereafter.  The  government  is  also  in  discussion  with  other  bilateral \npartners to be contributing members. \n \n25. \n\nThe MOF implemented two policy actions under output 3: \n(i)  Output  3.1.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the  governments  of  Nauru \n\nand Australia to establish the NTF was signed in November 2015. \n\n(ii)  Output  3.2.  A  budget  allocation  of  A$20.4  million  was  made  as  the  government\u2019s \ninitial  contribution  to  the  NTF,  including  A$10.4  million  to  be  paid  from  FY2016 \n\n                                                \n20 The  NTF  committee  will  determine  when  the  distribution  phase  is  to  begin  based  on  the  ability  of  the  NTF  to \nprovide a material amount of budget financing in perpetuity. A principal value of A$400 million is currently targeted.  \n\n \n\n\frevenues and A$10.0 million to be paid from cash set-asides from the two previous \nfinancial years. These set-asides are also a condition for disbursement. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $2  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  government  has  also  requested  grant \ncofinancing from the Government of Australia equivalent to $1.8 million.21 \n \n27. \nADB is basing the size of its $2 million grant on Nauru\u2019s future service delivery financing \nneeds, which remain substantial, and the cost of its reform program, which amounted to around \n$3 million in 2013\u20132015. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nProgram  management.  The  MOF,  as  the  executing  agency,  has  overseen  timely \nimplementation  of  the  agreed  policy  actions  by  the  implementing  agencies,  and  is  responsible \nfor  program  administration,  disbursements,  and  records  maintenance.  The  MOF,  through  the \nDepartments of Treasury and Revenue, was the implementing agency for output 1, and through \nthe Departments of Planning and Aid, and Treasury, was the implementing agency for output 3. \nThe  NUC  implemented  output  2.  Ongoing  TA  projects  (footnotes  12  and  14)  helped  the \ngovernment fulfill program conditions. The program implementation period was from June 2014 \nto June 2016. \n \nTranches  and  disbursement. The grant will be provided in a single tranche. ADB will \n29. \ntransfer the grant proceeds directly into the account of the NTF held at a designated custodian \nbank  based  in  Australia,  immediately  after  the  NTF  account  has  been  opened  and  after  the \ngovernment has made its own initial contribution of A$20.4 million to the NTF. The government \nwill  finance  the  local  currency  cost  relating  to  the  implementation  of  the  program  and  other \nactivities  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  program,  and  will  provide  the  necessary  budget \nappropriation to finance costs relating to the implementation of reforms under the program. The \nproceeds of the grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement \nprocedures and related requirements for policy-based grants.22 \n \n30. \nThe government will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral and \nbilateral aid partners that may have implications for the program and will provide ADB  with an \nopportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  government  will  take  ADB\u2019s \nviews into account before finalizing and implementing any such proposal. \n \n31. \nProgram  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  government  will  monitor  the \nimplementation and outcome of the program using the set of indicators and targets in the design \nand  monitoring  framework  agreed  between  the  government  and  ADB.  For  each  of  the  agreed \nindicators, progress will  be measured against the baselines in the framework. The responsible \nimplementing  agencies  will  support  the  review  of  agreed  actions  to  determine  progress  and \nidentify  constraints.  ADB  will  provide  policy  dialogue  and  TA  support  to  support  post-program \nimplementation. \n \n\n                                                \n21  Funds will be deposited directly into the NTF bank account as outlined in Schedule 2 of the draft grant agreement. \n22 ADB. 1998.

These objectives are essential to inclusive economic growth in Nauru, \nwhile improving the environment for job creation and poverty reduction. \n \nA. \n \n33. \nRecent  windfall  revenues  have  greatly  improved  Nauru\u2019s fiscal  position, which  remains \ndependent on a narrow set of highly uncertain income streams that need careful management \nto avoid serious fiscal problems (footnote 7). During FY2012\u2013FY2014, a large share of windfall \nrevenue  was  used  to  improve  the  government\u2019s  balance  sheet.  However,  more  recently,  debt \nrepayments  have  slowed  and  the  state  budget  has  become  increasingly  reliant  on  vulnerable \nand unsustainable revenue streams. The reform measures included in the policy matrix will help \nto  address  these  issues.  An  economic  and  fiscal  assessment,  undertaken  by  ADB  staff, \nreplaces the IMF assessment letter as Nauru is not an IMF member (footnote 7).  \n \nB. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \n34. \nprogram.  Gaps  in  financial  controls  and  domestic  resource  mobilization  have  been  minimized \nthrough  the  program  (paras.  19\u201320).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  legal  documents. 23  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the program. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe  program  will  contribute  to  poverty  alleviation  by  supporting  sustainable,  equitable, \nand  inclusive  long-term  economic  growth  built  on  (i)  improved  PFM,  (ii) better  service  delivery \nby the NUC, (iii) reduced subsidies to the NUC, (iv) increased domestic resource mobilization, \nand (v) saving of windfall revenues to fund future service delivery.24 \n \nD. \n \n36. \nProgram  activities  are  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  none  of  the \nactivities  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No \nadverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  Safeguard  categories  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe  program\u2019s  overall  risk  is  rated  medium.  The  key  risks  and  related  mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  Fiduciary  risks  have  been  addressed  through  the  PFM \nreform activities (paras.19\u201320).

The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB is satisfied that \nall conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy matrix and set out \nin  Attachment  2  to  Schedule  2  of  the  draft  grant  agreement,  have  been  complied  with  to  the \nsatisfaction  of ADB.  No withdrawals  will  be  made from  the grant  account  until the government \nhas  established  the  NTF  account  at  a  designated  custodian  bank  based  in  Australia  and  after \nthe government has made its own initial contribution to the NTF account. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n39. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant of $2,000,000 to the Government of Nauru for the Fiscal Sustainability Reform Program, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n29 February 2016 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n25   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  goals  and  objectives  of  Nauru\u2019s  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy, \n2005\u20132025, a which aims to improve the \u201csustainable quality of life for all Nauruans\u201d through the following: \n1.
