In July 2009, a grant of $750,000 from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \nwas approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for establishing Women and Children \nService Centers (WCSCs).1 The government contribution is $58,500 to cover portions of cost \nrequirements and part of (i) incremental recurrent staff costs, (ii) operational costs and costs for \nequipment  and  supplies  for  the  WCSCs,  and  (iii)  costs  for  consultation  meetings.  The \ncommunities will provide $12,000 through participation and in-kind contributions. At the time of \nthe grant approval, the total estimated project cost was $820,500. The grant became effective \non 19 January 2010 and is expected to be completed by 19 January 2014. \n \n2.  The  project  has  experienced  cost  overruns  and  additional  financing  is  needed.  An \nadditional  $195,8942 cofinancing  grant  from  the  Department  for  International  Development \n(DFID) of the United Kingdom is available. Approval of the ADB Board of Directors is sought on \na no-objection basis for ADB to administer the grant in accordance with ADB\u2019s Operation \nManual (section H.5: Additional Financing).3  The additional financing will not entail a change in \nthe project scope and implementation. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n3.  Poverty in Nepal is characterized by the exclusion of poor and vulnerable groups\u2014such \nas low castes, ethnic groups, and women\u2014from access to resources and opportunities. Nepal\u2019s \nTenth Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007)4 and the following 3-year interim development plan (FY2008\u2013\nFY2010)5 recognize  that  overcoming  low  levels  of  human  development  requires  ensuring \ndevelopment addresses the needs of women, the very poor, and deprived communities, castes, \nand regions. \n \n4.  The high incidence of crimes against women and children, including domestic and other \nviolence, exacerbates the difficulties these groups face in participating in development. Violence \nagainst women and children is unacceptable from a social justice standpoint, and has an \nassociated economic cost, as both women and their dependent children experience (i) reduced \n(a)  productivity,  (b)  participation  in  community  and  development  activities,  (c)  control  over \nresources, and (d) self-confidence; and (ii) increased (a) homelessness and helplessness, (b) \ndemand for medical  and  community  support  services,  and  (c)  expenditures  on  police  and \njudicial services. In addition, child abuse, early child labor, and child marriage prevent affected \nchildren from  participating  in  education,  thereby  decreasing their chance  of  later  elevating \nthemselves out of poverty. \n \n5.  The central WCSC was established in 1996 at police headquarters and a district WCSC \nwas established in Kathmandu with the main task of investigating crimes against women and \nchildren, in close cooperation with various government agencies, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs),  and  civil  society.  The  central  WCSC  is  under  the  direct  command  of  the  crime \ninvestigation department of the Nepal Police. Its objective is to create a conducive environment \nin which women and child victims of crimes feel safe in filing complaints against offenders. It \nformulates policy and programs for all service centers. Prior to the establishment of WCSCs, the \nvictims of such crimes were reluctant to lodge their complaints against offenders, in particular to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.

This situation highlighted the need for a special investigative \nteam composed of female police officers. \n \n6.  To date, there are 27 WCSCs, mostly in Kathmandu Valley and in border districts, where \nthe focus is on trafficking. Major issues faced by the existing central and district WCSCs are the \nlack  of  (i)  recognition  of  their  status  as  an  independent  department  within  the  police;  (ii) \nseparate allocation of a budget and human resources; (iii) systematic staff training to help \nWCSCs  assist  women  and  child  victims  of  highly  sensitive  crimes;  (iv)  systematic, \ninstitutionalized  coordination  with  NGOs,  communities,  and  civil  society,  and  of  a  clear \nunderstanding by all stakeholders of the different roles and responsibilities of police and civil \nsociety; and (v) awareness by the public at large of their existence and role. The project is \nintended to address these issues and establish new WCSCs. \n \n7.  The goal of the project is to reduce the vulnerability and helplessness of women and \nchildren  in  five  districts  of  Nepal  through  the  provision  of  professional  and  coordinated \nprotection and assistance to women and children who are victims of rape, domestic violence, \npolygamy, alleged witchcraft, child abuse, child marriage, and trafficking. This will increase their \nchances of reintegration into mainstream society and thus their participation in the development \nprocess, leading eventually to poverty reduction.  \n \n8.  The  project  is  under  implementation  through  its  five  components:  (i)  civil  society \nconsultation prior to establishing WCSCs, (ii) establishment of five WCSCs in rural districts and \none for central Kathmandu, (iii) capacity development, (iv) outreach and networking, and (v) \nproject management. The Nepal Police Headquarters is the executing agency and its central \nWCSC is the implementing agency, together with district-level WCSCs.  \n \n9.  A minor change was approved on 19 October 2010 reducing the target districts from \nseven to five.6 Four out of five were replacements based on changes in need as evidenced by \nreported crime incidence since the project was designed. All remain within the original project \narea which represents the poorest and most disadvantaged areas of Nepal where gender \ndiscrimination is pervasive. The change in districts did not change the project\u2019s objective, scope, \nimplementation and benefits. \n \n10.  All  procurement  under  the  project  is  being  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). International project consultants \nwill be recruited by the executing agency in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Local NGOs and consultants are contracted \nby the grant implementation unit (GIU) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Grant funds are being disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The government is maintaining separate \naccounts and records for the project in accordance with sound accounting principles and the \nFinancial Management Guidelines of ADB7. \n \nIII.  PROJECT PERFORMANCE  \n11.  During the inception mission in March 2010, it was found that the funding for the civil \nworks under this project was insufficient to cover the construction costs for all of six WCSCs.  \nThe current fund allocation would allow completion of only three out of the six WCSCs to be \n                                                \n6  Districts are Bara, Dhanusha, Doti (retained), Jumla, and Rautahat. \n7  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila \n ", "3 \nconstructed.  The staff assessment of this cost overrun was that (i) 51%8 was due to an initial \ncost estimate found to be based on an inappropriate model; (ii) 39%9 was due to significant \nincrease in costs of materials, transportation, and labor during the 6 years lapsed between the \nproject design and implementation and (iii) the Nepalese rupee has appreciated against the US \ndollar during this period.10 \n \n12.  After a slow start-up and despite the cost overrun, the pace of implementation started to \naccelerate when the project coordinator and management consultant joined the GIU in October \n2010  to  assist  in  project  coordination  and  monitoring.  The  project  is  performing  well  with \nphysical progress as of February 2011 at 12% against the elapsed period of 36%. Major \nperformance aspects are summarized below: \n(i)    The JFPR progress report (Appendix 3) rated the project not at risk and on track \nto meet its output targets with major activities including: (a) establishing the GIU \nand the national project advisory committee in 2010; (b) holding consultation \nworkshops  in  Bara,  Doti,  Jumla,  and  Rautahat  before  establishment  of  the \nWCSCs;  (c)  launching  an  advance  public  information  campaign\u2014using \nawareness-raising radio dramas, short films, information posters, and a video \ndocumentary\u2014in the project districts to sensitize people about the objectives of \nestablishing the WCSC and its services; (d) forwarding expressions of interest \nand  short-listed  organizations  for  the  recruitment  for  the  baseline  survey  on \nviolence against women and children to ADB for review and approval; and (e) \napproving bidding documents for the construction of the WCSCs in Bara, Doti, \nand Rautahat. \n(ii)    Contract awards totaled $72,000 (9.6%) and disbursement $66,000 (8%). The \ndisbursement represents the initial advance to the imprest account. \n(iii)    The project has not encountered any safeguard issues. \n(iv)    The  executing  agency  has  reiterated  its  commitment  to  managing  risk  by \nagreeing to (a) have strict financial controls including annual external audits of \nthe  project  accounts;  (b)  have  special  arrangements  regarding  the  use  of \nequipment (which is intended only for the WCSCs), and have the executing \nagency replace it in case of disappearance; (c) assign women recruits to the \nWCSCs who have special training in crimes against women and children; (d) not \ntransfer trained staff for at least 3 years; and (e) facilitate the assignment of \nwomen staff who can communicate in local languages.  \n \n13.  The  project  will  deliver  significant  economic  and  social  benefits to the  women  and \nchildren of Nepal, especially those who are poor and disadvantaged.   \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED CHANGES \n14.  ADB approached DFID for additional financing to make up for the shortfall in the cost of \nconstruction of the WCSCs. DFID responded by committing $195,894 in cofinancing, which will \nsupport completion of the remaining three WCSCs. \n \n                                                \n8  The cost was taken from a community building at village level from the ADB (2004) L2143:-NEP Gender Equality \nand Empowerment of Women project (Manila). That building was considerably smaller, built using local materials \n(e.g., mud), and had no provision for utilities. This original design-cost error accounts for 51% of the cost overrun. \nThe budget also had no provision for escalation since all construction was expected to take place in Year 1. \n9  ADB. Jan 2011. Domestic Cost Escalation Factors, 2010-2014 (percent). Manila. Average inflation in Nepal \nbetween FY2000 and FY2010 was 5.7%.  Implementation was delayed by 6 years due to heavy insurrection in the \nproject areas during this period.  \n10 Exchange rate in April 2004 was 1 USD = NRs 73 vs. exchange rate in March 2011 of 1 USD, = NRs 71.6 which \naccounts for 2% of the cost overrun. \n ", "4 \n15.  Arrangements for implementation and monitoring and evaluation will remain the same as \nin the original design. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The project \nimplementation period will remain at 4 years, with no change in the implementation schedule. \nRegarding  public  relations  and  financing  acknowledgement,  of  the  six  WCSCs  to  be \nconstructed, three will have the JFPR logo exclusively, and three will have both the JFPR and \nDFID logos. JFPR will still finance the project management cost, and all communication will \nmention JFPR before DFID. \n \n16.  The additional $195,894 contribution from DFID will increase the overall project cost \nfrom $820,500 to $1,016,394. The rest of the funding allocation will remain unchanged.

The project scope impact, outcomes, and outputs will remain the same as originally \napproved. The project will deliver significant economic and social benefits to the women and \nchildren of Nepal especially those who are poor and disadvantaged. The additional financing of \n$195,894 will be used to meet the cost overrun to be incurred above the project cost estimate \nas  originally  approved  by  the  President  and  enable  the  project to  deliver  its  benefits  and \ndevelopment objectives.  \n \nVI.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve the administration by ADB of a grant \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $195,894 as additional financing to Nepal for Establishing \nWomen and Children Service Centers, to be provided by the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom. \n \n19.
