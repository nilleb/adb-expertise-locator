In \n2012, the International Energy Agency estimated the number at 304 million, most of whom live \nin  rural  areas  outside  the  reach  of  conventional  electricity  grid  networks,  so  they  rely  on \nkerosene as their primary source of lighting, if and when available.3 According to a recent report \nby  the  Climate  Group,  about  77  million  households  in  India  (or  about  360  million  people)  lack \nadequate access to grid electricity, with an additional 20 million underserved households (about \n95  million  people)  receiving  less  than  4  hours  of  reliable  electricity  per  day. 4  While  the \navailability  of  grid  electricity  is  expected  to  improve  by  2025\u2014if  the  current  rate  of  grid \nexpansion, urbanization, and population growth continue to hold\u2014it is estimated that 70 million\u2013\n75 million households will still lack access to grid electricity in India by 2024. Over 90% of these \nhouseholds  live  in  rural  areas  where  population  growth  rates  are  higher  and  grid  expansion \nrates are lower than in urban areas, so it is unlikely that the number of rural households that are \ncurrently  not  served  or  underserved  by  the  electricity  grid  will  fall  significantly  by  2024.  Solar \nphotovoltaic  technology  offers  a  clean  alternative  to  address  off-grid  access  to  electricity. \nHowever, the effective decentralized energy solutions using solar photovoltaic technology, such \nas  solar  home  systems  (SHSs)  and  community-scale  solar  micro-grids,  involve  significant  up-\nfront costs for rural consumers and have, as a result, very limited market penetration. \n  \n3. \nSimpa, a wholly owned subsidiary of Simpa Networks Inc., targets the underserved and \nunelectrified  rural  population  in  India  by  providing  simple,  affordable,  and  accessible  solar \nenergy to consumers (households and microenterprises).  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design   \n\n4. \nSimpa is an entrepreneurial company that offers a secure, prepaid payment platform to \nmake  clean  energy  solutions  simple  and  affordable  for  underserved  electricity  consumers  in \nIndia.  The  \u201ctechnology  +  service  +  finance\u201d  platform  leverages  cell  phones  to  unlock  demand \nfrom  consumers  while  providing  risk  mitigation  for  the  company,  which  finances  the  solar \nequipment. Simpa\u2019s clients are typically (i) rural households with no connection to the national \nelectricity grid; (ii) rural households getting less than 12 hours of electricity supply per day from \nthe grid; and (iii) microenterprises such as tea stalls, village shops, and small restaurants. \n\n                                                \n1  See the Climate Investment Funds. http://www.cif. climateinvestmentfunds.org \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  International  Energy  Agency.  World  Energy  Outlook. \n\nenergydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/ (accessed 17 August 2015). \n\nhttp://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/ \n\n4  Climate Group (in partnership with Goldman Sachs). 2015.  The Business Case for Off-grid Energy in India. New \nDelhi  (with  data  and  analysis  from  International  Finance  Corporation.  2015.  Assessment  of  the  Off-Grid  Solar \nAppliance Lighting Market in India. Market research report. New Delhi). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n5. \nUnder  the  prepaid  pricing  for  SHSs,  Simpa\u2019s  customers  make  a  small  initial  down \npayment for the installation of a solar photovoltaic system and then prepay an availability charge \non a per day basis for the energy usage, with the flexibility to top up their systems in small user-\ndefined increments using a cell phone. Once a payment (e.g., 30 days of usage) is made using \nthe short message service (SMS), the user immediately receives an SMS with a (top-up) code \nthat  can  be  entered  using  the  keypad  on  the  SHS  meter.  Thereafter,  the  system  debits  the \nuser\u2019s account based on the actual energy usage. Each payment for energy contributes toward \nthe  amortization of the  system  purchase  price,  with the  customer  having the  option  to  buy the \nsystem at predetermined prices at various intervals throughout the product lifecycle.  Once fully \npaid  (typically  2\u20133  years  after  the  initial  purchase),  the  system  unlocks  permanently  and \ncontinues to produce electricity for the customer without any further payments. This transforms \nthe recurrent energy expenditure, which used to be spent on kerosene, into an asset purchase. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\n \n\nSimpa is a wholly owned (and the only) subsidiary of Simpa Networks Inc., a company \n\n6. \nincorporated in the State of Delaware.  \n \nPaul  Needham  is  the  chief  executive  officer  of  Simpa  and  is  supported  by  an \n7. \nexperienced  management  team.  Simpa\u2019s  management  team  comprises  a  mix  of  local  and \nforeign  professionals  with  experience  across  a  variety  of  fields  including  solar  finance,  energy \naccess, micropayments, and information technology.  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n8. \nImpacts.  The  project  will  (i)  improve  access  to  off-grid  electricity  supply  to  the  rural \npopulation  in  India,  the  availability  of  which  can  yield  benefits  such  as  improved  education \noutcomes as children can study after sunset and improved hygiene; (ii) reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by substituting kerosene with solar energy, also improving air quality and benefiting \nthe  respiratory  health  of  household  members;  and  (iii)  improve  access  to  gender  benefits  for \nfemale  beneficiaries.  Successful  implementation  of  this  off-grid  energy  solution  across  India \ncould also have a demonstration effect in neighboring Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, which \nhave chronic power shortages and a high percentage of unelectrified rural households. Further \ncapital infusion will also give credence to the case for increasing financing for innovative off-grid \nrenewable energy solutions in South Asia. \n \n9. \nmillion households by 2017, while avoiding 77,108 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. \n \n10. \nOutput. The output of the project is installation of sustainable solar systems for houses \nand microenterprise. Project\u2019s successful implementation will result in the production of at least \n103.3 gigawatt-hours per annum from clean energy with locally purchased goods and services \namounting to  Rs1.6  billion  by  2017.  Simpa\u2019s marketing initiative  will  also  reach  25,000 women \nbeneficiaries. \n \nC. \n\nOutcome. The project will result in increased access to clean energy for a quarter of a \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n11. \nConsistency  with  ADB  Strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  financing  is  consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 as it relates to two of the five core focus areas\u2014\n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ninfrastructure  and  environment.5 Under  its  Strategy  2020,  ADB  is  committed  to  expanding  the \nsupply  of  energy  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  way.6 The  investment  is  also  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, which highlights access to energy as \none of key areas of ADB\u2019s engagement.7 \n \n12. \nConsistency with energy policy. The investment will directly contribute to the outcome \nof increasing the number of households with access to electricity and, thereby, will be consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Energy  for  All  Program  initiative  under  which  commitments  have  been  made  for \nscaling up access to affordable, modern, and clean energy for the rural poor. \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  ADB  operations.  ADB  has  been  one  of  the  leaders  in  supporting \nprivate sector initiatives for solar energy in India, and has been instrumental in supporting utility \nscale  and  off-grid  solar  initiatives.  The  investment  highlights  ADB\u2019s  multi-product  approach  to \nsupporting private sector investors for both utility scale and off-grid solar projects, and its ability \nto customize its financial products to cater to market needs and take associated risks. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nTable 2 summarizes the project costs, and Table 3 summarizes the financing plan. \n\n14. \n \n\nTable 2: Project Cost \n\nItem \nCapital expenditures for additional 75,000 solar home systems \nBranch operating expenditures \n  \n \nUnit expenses (customers acquisition and servicing costs for village level \nentrepreneurs)  \nWorking capital for expansion \n \n\nExisting branch network and head office \nNew branches \n\n \n\nTotal \nSource: Simpa Energy India Private Limited. \n  \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nDebt: Clean Technology Funda \nDebt: Other commercial cofinancing  \nEquity \nInternally generated cash \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates; Simpa Energy India Private Limited. \n \n \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n14.0 \n \n3.6 \n1.4  \n\n3.5 \n\n1.5 \n24.0 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n6.0 \n4.5 \n5.0 \n8.5 \n  24.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n58.3 \n \n15.0 \n5.8 \n\n14.6 \n\n6.3 \n100.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n25.0 \n18.8 \n20.8 \n35.4 \n100.0 \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

This transaction allows Simpa to access ADB\u2019s network, knowledge, \nand  experience  in  the  solar  sector,  especially  in  India  where  ADB  has  deep  understanding  of \nboth  utility  level  and off-grid  needs  and  has  played  an  important role from  both the  policy  and \nproject perspectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n17. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  were  assessed,  as  well  as  the  institutional \ncapacity  and  commitment  of  Simpa  for  environmental  and  social  management.  Simpa\u2019s \nbusiness  activities  have minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental,  health,  and  safety  impacts  and \nare  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Simpa  will \ncomply with applicable national laws and regulations on environment, health, and safety. \n \nA  gender  action  plan  is  prepared  to  capture  gender  measures  implemented  in  the \n18. \nproject. 9  Gender  measures \ntargeting  women \nbeneficiaries,  monitoring  the  number  of  women  in  households  who  have  improved  access  to \nelectricity  through  the  use  of  Simpa\u2019s  products,  and  prioritizing  and  monitoring  the  number  of \nwomen  staff  and  village  level  entrepreneurs.  Simpa  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and, \npursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  social  protection  strategy,  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.10 The  borrower  will  report  regularly  to ADB  on \n(i)  its  compliance  with  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11 \n \n\nlaunching  marketing \n\ninitiatives \n\ninclude \n\n                                                \n8  In  May  2014,  the  trust  fund  committee  of  the  CTF  approved  a  $34.5  million  regional  program\u2014the  Renewable \nEnergy Mini-Grids and Distributed Power Generation Program\u2014to be administered by ADB over a  3-year period \nthrough private sector operations. Approval of individual investments has been fully delegated to ADB in line with \nCTF governance arrangements. An investment in Simpa is referenced in the proposal and was well received.
