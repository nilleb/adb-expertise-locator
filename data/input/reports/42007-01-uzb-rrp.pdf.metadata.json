The \nreport also describes a technical assistance (TA) proposal for Capacity Building for Microfinance \nDevelopment,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nThe  Project  facilitates  access  to  credit  by  micro  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  across \n2. \nUzbekistan. It supports the generation of employment and sustains about 30,000 jobs for men \nand  women.  It  contributes  to  inclusive  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  intervention \ncomprises (i) a loan of $50 million to be channeled through three participating commercial banks \n(PCBs)1 for onlending to viable MSEs; and (ii) a TA grant of $600,000 to improve PCBs' MSE  \nfinance  capacity  and  their  subborrowers'  entrepreneurial  skills.  Appendix  1  contains  the \nproject\u2019s design and monitoring framework.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nEconomic  significance  of  small  business.  After  a  difficult  transition  in  the  1990s \n3. \nfollowing  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  economy  has  been  growing  steadily. \nBetween  2005  and  2009,  the  average  rate  of  increase  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was \n8.2%.  The share of small businesses in the GDP increased from 30% in 2000 to 50% in 2009. \nThis is expected to increase to 52.5% in 2010. By the end of 2009, there were about 8.4 million \npeople working in 422,401 MSEs and sole proprietorship businesses.2 A focus on horticulture3 \nand  value-added  processing,  storage,  transport,  and  other  related  services  in  the  farm-to-\nmarket  chain  benefits  microenterprises  (i.e.,  smallholder  farms  and  plantations)  and  small \nbusinesses  (storage,  refrigeration,  transport  services,  wholesale,  retail,  and  agro-processing). \nThere  are  strong  complementarities  between  these  two  business  segments  because  of \nbackward and forward linkages.4   \n \nUnmet credit demand. Despite strong credit growth in recent years, demand by MSEs \n4. \nremains unmet at present. According to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan, total loans granted by \ncommercial  banks  to  MSEs  reached  $898  million  (SUM1.25  trillion)  in  2008  and  $1.2  billion \n(SUM1.85 trillion) in 2009. The amount allocated to microcredit by commercial banks increased \nby  about  100%  in  2009  over  2008  and  is  targeted  to  increase  by  another  30%  to  reach  $275 \nmillion  (SUM  420  billion)  in  2010.5 According  to  a  World  Bank  survey,6 only  7.8%  of  business \nfinancing is met by loans\u2014the lowest percentage in the region (where the average is 23.3%). \n                                                 \n1  The PCBs are Agrobank, Hamkorbank, and Ipak Yuli Bank.   \n2  In Uzbekistan, a microenterprise is defined as an enterprise employing 1\u201320 persons in industry and 1\u20135 (in some \ncases 1\u201310) persons in services; a small enterprise is one that employs 21\u201350 persons in agriculture and industry, \nand 6\u201325 persons in services (Resolution of the Cabinet of Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan, no. 439, dated \n11  October  2003).  At  the  end  of  2008,  small  enterprises  employed  525,500  persons  and  microenterprises \nemployed  about  1.64  million  persons;  another  5.86  million  were  self-employed,  running  sole  proprietorship \nbusinesses. \n\n3  Agricultural  reforms  have  freed  horticulture  from  state  quotas  and  price  controls  and,  particularly  in  the  Fergana \n\nValley, encouraged family farms to concentrate on horticulture. \n\n4  Macroeconomic and Sector Analysis, and Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n5  The Law on Microfinance, approved in September 2006, quantifies microcredit as 1,000 times the minimum wage \n(presently pegged at SUM37,800), microloans as 100 times the minimum wage, and micro-leasing as 2,000 times \nthe minimum wage.  \n\n6  World Bank Group. 2009.

MSE\u2019s  access \n\nADB\u2019s  past  credit  lines  to  Uzbekistan7 indicate  high  demand  from  micro,  small,  and  medium-\nsized business operating in all sectors, particularly agriculture and agroprocessing. \n \n5. \nis \nconstrained  by  the  nature  and  characteristics  of  the  financial  sector  in  Uzbekistan,  which  is \nsubject to various distortions. For instance, directed lending at subsidized interest rates leads to \nmisallocation  of  resources.  For  depositors,  practical  difficulties  in  cash  withdrawals  from  bank \naccounts have created a premium for cash and a trust gap for banks in terms of their ability to \nmobilize  customer  deposits.  This  is  manifested  by  a  low  (individual  and  household  customer) \nbank  deposits\u2013GDP  ratio  of  6.6%  in  2009.8 The  government  has  put  in  place  measures  to \nincrease  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  which  are  expected  to  raise  deposits \nmobilization.9 \n \n6. \nSelection  of  strong  PCBs.  The  proposed  intervention  will  meet  a  share  of  the  MSE \ncredit  demand  while  addressing  financial  sector  distortions.  This  will  be  achieved  through \nworking  with  PCBs  committed  to  sustainable  MSE  financing  that  meet  the  following  criteria: \n(i) financial soundness (solvency, liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and prudence);10 (ii) extensive \nrural  retail  network;  (iii)  a  proven  track  record  and  efficiency  in  non-subsidized  microfinance \nintermediation;  (iv)  ability  and  willingness  to  manage  the  foreign  exchange  risk  prudently;  and \n(v)  transparent  corporate,  financial,  and  management  governance  practices.  Based  on  these \ncriteria,  ADB  selected  three  PCBs:  Agrobank,  Hamkorbank,  and  Ipak  Yuli  Bank  (IYB). \nHamkorbank and IYB are privately owned, while Agrobank is majority government owned.  \n \n7. \nThe  selected  PCBs\u2019  business  models  and  client  profile  correspond  well  with  the \nproposed  project  objectives.  Their  business  models  aim  at  (i)  increasing  their  retail  presence \ngeographically,  (ii) diversifying  operations  into  various  sectors,  (iii)  offering  new  products  to \nmeet customer needs and increase profitability, and (iv) better outreach to viable but unbanked \nand  under-banked  potential  clients.  Their  client  base  is  diverse:  Agrobank  has  a  strong \npresence in the agriculture and agro-processing sectors, while Hamkorbank and IYB are more \nfocused  in  the  trade  finance  sector  (IYB  also  has  significant  exposure  to  light  manufacturing). \nMicro and small business loans constitute close to one-third of Hamkorbank\u2019s and one-fourth of \nIYB\u2019s loan portfolios; for Agrobank, they constitute one-tenth (given the much larger size of its \noverall portfolio). For their loans up to $20,000, the average loan size is $4,000, with an average \nrepayment period of 18 months. These loans finance both investment and working capital.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1996.

The \nindividual and household bank deposits\u2013GDP ratio increased consistently since 2000, from 0.9% to 6.6% in 2009 \n(or from SUM33.6 billion to SUM2.9 trillion in 2009, in absolute terms). For further details, see Macroeconomic and \nSectoral Analysis, and Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n\n10 For solvency, PCBs will be required to have a Basel I compliant capital adequacy ratio of not less than 12%. For \nprofitability,  they  will  have  a  return  on  assets  ratio  of  not  less  than  1%.  For  liquidity,  they  will  maintain  a  loan\u2013\ndeposit ratio of under 100%. For efficiency, they will be required to have an intermediation cost ratio of less than \n15%. To be conservative and financially prudent, the PCBs\u2019 loan delinquency and  write-off ratio shall not exceed \n5%. \n\n\fADB loan size linked to PCB\u2019s business growth. Judging by their loan\u2013deposit ratios, \n8. \nall  three  PCBs  have  demonstrated  an  ability  to  raise  and  retain  customer  deposits  for  MSE \nintermediation. Their outstanding MSE loan balances were $51.4 million in December 2008 and \n$75.8 million  in  November  2009,  i.e.  growing  by  more  than  50%  notwithstanding  the  global \nfinancial  crisis.  Assuming  a  similar  linear  trajectory  on  a  compounded  basis,  their  MSE  loans \noutstanding  could  reach  $484.6  million  by  2013.  The  expected  credit  growth  justifies  an  ADB \nloan of $50 million, which complements but does not substitute the PCBs\u2019 deposit mobilization. \nTo  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  the  MSE  sector,  PCBs  will  be  required  to  match  ADB\u2019s \ncredit allocation with their own funds. \n \n9. \nMarket  orientation  and  increase  in  financial  choices.  The  Government  has  agreed \nwith  the  application  of  market-based  principles  under  the  project,  including  market  based \nonlending rates, choice of currency by sub-borrowers and unrestricted cash withdrawals for sum \nsubloans. PCBs may offer US dollar subloans through bank transfers. In the case of subloans in \nsum,  subborrowers  may  draw  down  loans  in  any  legal  form,  including  cash.  This  effectively \naddresses the existing distortion between cash and noncash markets.11 Collateral will be neither \na  condition  nor  a  prohibition.  Given  the  continuous  depreciation  of  the  sum  against  the  US \ndollar, it is expected that MSEs will borrow in US dollars only if their revenues are denominated \nin hard currency. This may be the case mainly for MSEs engaged in trading. Given the profile of \ntheir clients, the volume of US dollar denominated subloans is expected to be higher in the case \nof Hamkorbank and IYB12 than Agrobank.13 \n \n10. \nAttention to underserviced groups and gender sensitivity. To benefit subborrowers \nof  smaller  subloans,  PCBs  may  make  subloans  to  microcredit  organizations  (MCOs)  up  to \n$20,000 equivalent each, provided they (i) apply the subloan eligibility criteria to subborrowers; \nand  (ii)  make  loans  to  their  (MCOs)  subborrowers  not  exceeding  $1,000  each.  This  approach \nwill give PCBs the advantage of wholesale economies by lending to institutions that target lower \nincome  beneficiaries,  particularly  among  women.  To  ensure  wide  distribution,  50%  of  the \naggregate  outstanding  principal  amounts  of  PCBs  lending  under  the  project  to  subborrowers \nother  than  MCOs  will  be  for  loan  sizes  up  to  $10,000.  Lending  by  the  three  PCBs  to  women \ncurrently represents one-quarter to one-third of the total number of microcredit loans. TA will be \nprovided to help improve the PCBs\u2019 credit appraisal capacities for MSE and gender sensitivity, \nas  well  as  to  improve  the  skills  of  subborrowers  (particularly  women)  in  business  plan \npreparation  and  credit  application.  This  will  complement  credit  outreach  and  client \nempowerment work. \n \nStrategic fit and lessons learned. The project complies with ADB\u2019s country partnership \n11. \nstrategy, 14  which  supports  sustainable  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  gender  and \ndevelopment, and its Microfinance Strategy.15 For rural nonfarm enterprise development, ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  encourages  forward  and  backward  linkages  with  the  agricultural \nsector.  These  linkages  absorb  surplus  labor  released  from  agriculture.  The  loan  will  carry \nforward this principle to other sectors as well. It also supports the development of rural financial \nservices and promotes more efficient intermediation functions by commercial banks. It seeks (by \nallowing  subborrowers  to  draw  down  their  sum  subloans  in  cash  if  they  so  choose)  to  abolish \n\n                                                 \n11 The  principle  of  withdrawal  of  sum  subloans  in  cash  is  consistent  with  the  law  in  Uzbekistan,  and  has  been \n\nfollowed in a similar project financed by another multilateral agency.   \n\n12 At  the  end  of  2008,  the  share  of  US  dollar-denominated  assets  was  29.5%  in  Hamkorbank\u2019s  balance  sheet  and \n\n16.6% in IYB\u2019s balance sheet.  \n\n13 Macroeconomic and Sectoral Analysis (Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2006.

The project was designed after \nconsultation with stakeholders, including other development partners, and incorporates lessons \nlearned from previous ADB microfinance interventions.16 In an earlier loan, ADB underestimated \nthe  demand  for  micro  and  small  business  credit  and  selected  a  bank  with  only  limited \nexperience in micro and small business lending. This time, ADB has selected PCBs with proven \noperational and financial capacity for MSE credit delivery and assessed the demand for credit \nbased on the business projections of the PCBs.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe project will generate jobs and create business opportunities in the MSE sector, thus \ncontributing  to  welfare  improvement  in  Uzbekistan  (Appendix  1).  Its  outcome  will  be  an \nexpanded,  viable  and  sustainable  MSE  finance  sector,  and  thus  an  increase  of  investment \nopportunities. 17 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nLending, Relending, and Onlending Arrangements \n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $50  million.  PCBs  will  provide  $50  million  in  counterpart \n\n13. \nThe  project  will  expand  microfinance  delivery  to  financially  viable  subborrowers  (men \nand women), by providing funding and training to the three PCBs. The project will also improve \nthe  entrepreneurial  capacity  of  subborrowers,  especially  women,  by  training  them  in  business \nplan preparation and credit applications. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nfunding.18\n  \n \nE. \n \n15. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $50  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources.  The  loan  will  have  a  20-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  other  such  terms  and \nconditions included in the loan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB with \n(i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n16. \nThe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  will  be  the  borrower.  The  government  will  relend  to  the \nPCBs the loan proceeds through three subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs):19 up to $20 million \nfor  Hamkorbank,  up  to  $20  million  for  Agrobank,  and  up  to  $10  million  for  IYB.  If  there  is  any \nchange  to  the  current  composition  of  PCBs,  the  borrower  may  reallocate  loan  proceeds \nbetween the PCBs in a manner acceptable to ADB. The government may charge the PCBs an \n\n                                                 \n16 Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n17  Contribution  to  the  Output  Aggregates  of  the  ADB  Results  Framework  and  Project  Classification  Summary \n\n(Appendix 2). \n\n18 For each subproject financed by a PCB,  at least 30%  of the subproject  costs shall be  met by equity  contribution \nfrom  the  subborrower.  The  balance  of  the  subproject  costs  shall  be  financed  via  a  subloan  from  the  PCB.  Such \nsubloan shall comprise 50% from the PCB\u2019s funds and 50% from the proceeds of the ADB loan relent to the PCB. \n19 It  is  expected  that  under  SLAs:  (i)  the  term  of  government  relending  to  PCBs  will  be  for  15  years,  with  a  3-year \ngrace period; (ii) a margin of up to 0.5%; and (iii) commitment fees charged to PCBs on a pro rata basis. The PCBs \nhave until 31 December 2013 to avail of their drawdown. \n\n\fappropriate margin for assuming the risk of loss due to the possibility of PCBs' nonpayment of \nthe loan. The PCBs will onlend loan funds in either sum or in US dollars to their subborrowers at \nmarket interest rates for up to 3 years. This will enable recycling of loan funds and thus widen \nthe number of beneficiaries. Subloans may be either to new or repeat subborrowers as long as \nthey  meet  viability  standards.20 The  PCBs  will  manage  their  foreign  exchange  and  credit  risks \nprudently  by  charging  appropriate  risk  premiums,  which  will  be  factored  into  their  onlending \nrates for subloans.21 \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n17. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  project  and  be \nresponsible  for  drafting,  executing,  and  overseeing  the  SLAs  with  the  PCBs.  The  three  PCBs \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  their  activities  in  the  project.  ADB  will  enter  into  a  loan \nagreement  with  MOF  and  three  separate  project  agreements  with  the  PCBs.22 Each  PCB  will \nestablish a project implementation unit adequately staffed and acceptable to ADB, as defined in \nthe  project  administration  manual  (PAM),  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  government  and  the \nPCBs.23 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.  \n\nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date  30 June 2013 \nEstimated loan closing date \nProject management \n(i)    Oversight Body \n\n31 December 2013 \n\n30 June 2010\u201330 June 2013 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n\nBanking Supervision Department \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan  \nMinistry of Finance \n \n \n(i)   Agrobank \n(ii)  Ipak Yuli Bank \n(iii)  Hamkorbank \n\nComposition of project implementation \nunits (PIUs):  \n4 PIU staff \n4 PIU staff \n3 PIU staff \n\nSources: Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Uzbekistan, Agrobank, Hamkorbank, and Ipak Yuli Bank. \n \n18. \nDetailed  arrangements  for  procurement,  disbursement,  accounting,  audit,  monitoring \nand  evaluation,  and  consulting  services  for  the  TA  are  explained  in  the  PAM.

For loans up to $1,000, PCBs will assess \ntheir  track  records,  future  cash  flows,  third-party  guarantees,  existing  debt  obligations,  and  other  criteria  deemed \nnecessary. \n\n21 PCBs\u2019 onlending rates for US dollar subloans currently range from 8% to 18% per annum, and for sum subloans \nfrom 36% to 48% per annum. Considering that PCBs will get access to US dollar loan funds from the borrower at \nmargins of up to 0.5%, their onlending rates adequately factor in their credit and foreign exchange risk premiums. \n\n22 Loan and Project Agreements (Appendix 2). \n23 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nand  guide  PCBs'  onlending  to  MCOs,  and  (v)  improve  PCBs\u2019  transparency  by  recommending \ntheir  display  of  MSE  loan  procedures  on  their  websites  and  train  their  staff  in  microfinance \naccounting  and  reporting  standards.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $615,000  equivalent,  of \nwhich  ADB  will  finance  $600,000  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013IV). 24  \nThe three PCBs will finance the balance in kind. MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. \nThe three PCBs will be the implementing agencies for the TA. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nADB\u2019s  initial  due  diligence  indicates  that  this  credit  facilty  is  financially  viable, \n\n20. \neconomically sustainable, socially desirable, and legally permissible. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe three PCBs\u2019 track records (by review of their audited financial statements, internal \ncontrol procedures, and corporate and financial governance practices) show them to be solvent, \nprofitable, liquid, efficient, and conservative. Their past capital adequacy ratios have been equal \nto  or  higher  than  12%,  according  to  Basel  I  formulations.  Their  return  on  assets  have  been \nequal  to  or  higher  than  1%.  Their  loan\u2013deposit  ratios  have  been  under  100%,  their \nintermediation  cost  ratios  under  15%,  and  their  bad  debts  have  never  exceeded  5%.25 The \nPCBs  will  be  required  to  maintain  such  sound  financial  performance  ratios  in  the  future  while \nimplementing  the  loan,  to  continue  to  be  eligible  intermediaries. 26  The  subproject  eligibility \ncriteria are designed to ensure viability and continued operational and financial soundness. \n \nSustainability will be supported by the government and Central Bank of Uzbekistan, by \n22. \n(i) allowing PCBs to onlend ADB funds at market interest rates without restrictions on the type or \npurpose of loan fund use; (ii) permitting subborrowers to draw down sum subloans in any legal \nform,  including  cash;  (iii)  creating  the  necessary  enabling  macroeconomic  and  financial \nenvironment  from  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy  perspective  for  MSE  development;  and  (iv) \nproviding ADB with information necessary to monitor ADB\u2019s results framework. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nReviews were conducted for the PCBs\u2019 credit, operational, and counterparty risks. ADB \nis  satisfied  with  measures  for  monitoring  and  mitigating  these  risks.  The  three  PCBs'  financial \nstatements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and \naudited  by  internationally  recognized  external  auditors  in  accordance  with  International \nStandards of Auditing acceptable to ADB. The three PCBs' corporate and financial governance \nstandards fully meet ADB's requirements. ADB will work closely with the government and PCBs \nto  ensure  that  subloans  will  not  finance  activities  that  contradict  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  A  PAM  outlining  the  detailed  project  implementation  arrangement  and  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  management  assessment,  agreed  between  ADB,  the  government,  and  PCBs,  will  be \nadhered to throughout the implementation period. \n \n\n                                                 \n24  The  TA  project's  detailed  costs  and  financing  plan,  activities,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and  its \n\nimplementation arrangements are in Technical Assistance (Appendix 2). \n25 See Loan and Project Agreements for definition of these ratios (Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis of Participating Commercial Banks (Appendix 2). The financial management assessment report \n\nand detailed analysis of their operational and financial performance are in the supplementary appendixes. \n\n\fADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n24. \nwith MOF and the three PCBs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nDespite  Uzbekistan\u2019s  recent  economic  growth,  25.8%  of  its  households  are  below  the \npoverty line.27 Poverty is correlated with unemployment or underemployment.28 Since MSEs are \nlabor\u2013intensive,  they  can  provide  employment  and  empowerment  opportunities  to  the  poor. \nBank  credit  is  an  important  prerequisite  to  this  goal.  Even  if  PCBs\u2019  subborrowers  are  not \nthemselves  poor,  their  use  of  bank  credit  will  enable  them  to  hire  30,000  more  workers  (both \nmen  and  women)  between  2010  and  2013.29 This  will  raise  employment  and  indirectly  reduce \npoverty.30 Providing  jobs  domestically  will  reduce  outward  migration  (of  the  unemployed)  and \nmitigate social costs. \n \nThus far, only about 22% of total bank lending in Uzbekistan has gone to women.31 This \n26. \nloan is expected to raise their share through (i) training of women borrowers; (ii) sensitization of \nbank  staff;  (iii)  developing  types  of  lending  of  particular  interest  to  women  such  as  solidarity \ngroup  lending,  micro-leasing,  and  lending  against  the  future  flow  of  remittances  (to  wives  of \nmigrant  workers);  (iv)  introduction  of  life  and  accident  credit  insurance  products  to  micro-loan \nborrowers; and (v) lending to MCOs, which will benefit poor women particularly in remote rural \nareas.  The  PCBs  will  maintain  sex-disaggregated  data  on  the  beneficiaries  of  their  small  and \nmicrofinance  loans  and  will  report  such  information  to  ADB.  The  project  has  effective  gender \nmainstreaming content.32 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  Project  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement33 and  complies  with  the \n27. \nrequirements  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  labor,  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  laws  and \nregulations.  It  falls  under  the  Financial  Intermediary  (FI)  category  with  respect  to  environment \nand social safeguards. It is treated as category C, as PCBs will finance only those subprojects \nwhich  have  minimal  or  no  adverse  social  or  environmental  risks.  Any  subprojects  (i)  falling \nunder  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  categories  A  and  B,  and/or  (ii) which \nspecifically  require  environmental  assessment  clearances  by  the  government,  will  not  be \nfinanced under the loan. ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activity list will apply. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28. \nThis  operation  is  classified  as  low  risk,  considering  (i)  the  loan  amount  is  only  $50 \nmillion;  (ii)  the  sound  record  of  ADB\u2019s  previous  experience  in  the  sector;  and  (iii)  reasonable \nexecuting agency capacity. This loan is categorized environment category FI, but treated as C \n\n                                                 \n27 Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2007. Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  of  Uzbekistan:  Full  Strategy  Paper  2008\u20132010. \n\nTashkent. \n\n28 About 50% of the poor belongs to households in which the head of the household is unemployed. An important part \nof the remaining 50% is the \u201cworking poor,\u201d engaged in low  productivity  jobs. Seventy percent of the poor live in \nrural areas.   \n\n29 This estimate is based on the experience of the first Small and Microfinance Development Project, through which \n\nabout 11,000 new jobs have been created so far, with nearly $36 million of debt financing. \n\n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n31 Source: Central Bank of Uzbekistan. \n32 Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2009.
