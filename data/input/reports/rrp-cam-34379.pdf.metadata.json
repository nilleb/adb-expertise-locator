It  will  promote  economic  growth  through \nenhanced agricultural production in rural areas in general and will \nreduce  farmers\u2019  exposure  to  variability  in  crop  yields  and  to  food \ninsecurity in more remote, disadvantaged, and poorer areas. The \nProject  is  formulated  as  a  sector  loan  project  and  will  finance \nsubprojects  that  enhance  irrigation  schemes  and  other  water \ncontrol  infrastructure  in  the  provinces  of  Pursat,  Battambang, \nBanteay  Meanchey,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  Project  will  adopt  an \nintegrated approach to irrigation development identifying/selecting \nschemes  with \nintegrated  water  resources \nmanagement  (IWRM)  approach in a river basin context and then \nrehabilitating  them.  Sustainability  will  be  ensured  by  supporting \nbeneficiary  participation  in  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nand,  progressive  irrigation  management  transfer,  and,  finally,  by \nattending  to  the  more  efficient  use  of  delivered  water  by \nsupporting agricultural intensification and crop diversification. The \nProject will support investments on a scale (small to medium) that \ncan  be  managed  and  maintained  by \nlocal  beneficiary \ncommunities. The Project will also enhance the capacity of those \nassociated with the plan, design, construction, management, O&M \nof  the  investments,  in  both  the  private  and  public  sectors  and in \nthe beneficiary farmer communities. \n \nThe  northwest  region  is  one  of  the  poorest  and  most  isolated \nareas in Cambodia. Due to war and civil strife it has been left out \nthe  past  decades. \nof  many  development  efforts  during \nConsequently, \nin \ninvestments \nit  suffers \ninstitutional  capacity  building. \ninfrastructure,  services,  and \nAgriculture  is  the  predominant  economic  activity  and  the  major \ncrop grown is rice, the staple food. Agricultural productivity is low \nand most rural areas in the northwest are exposed to food deficit \n(in some areas up to 6 months a year) even though Cambodia is, \nin average to good years, considered self-sufficient in rice.  Lack \nof  water  control  and  management  and  low  levels  of  agriculture \ntechnology  constrain  yields.  Overall  availability  of  water  in \nnorthwest  Cambodia  is  limited  and  resources  need  to  be \nmanaged prudently. There is,  however, a  significant   potential to \n \n\ninadequate \n\nfrom \n\n\fiv \n\n \nObjective \n\nimproving \n\nfarming  household \n\nraise agricultural production and rural incomes, and consequently \nreduce  poverty  in  areas,  where  an  enhanced  supply  of  water  is \nmanaged  properly  and  where  irrigated  agriculture  is  protected \nfrom  flooding.  Scope  exists  in  the  project  provinces  to  provide \nenhanced  small  to  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes  and  other \nwater control infrastructure, thus reducing risks of crop failure, and \nto encourage farmers to invest in higher levels of technology and \nadopt improved irrigated agriculture. Improved irrigation schemes \nwill  (i)  reduce  farmers\u2019  exposure  to  variability  in  crop  yields  and \ntherefore  to  food  insecurity,  especially  in  the  more  remote, \ndisadvantaged,  and  poorer  areas;  and  (ii)  raise  agricultural \nproduction  and  rural  incomes  in  more  advantaged  areas  where \nfood shortage is less of a problem and where crop diversification \nand commercially oriented agriculture can be promoted.  \n \nThe overall objective of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s \neffort  to  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas  of  northwest  Cambodia \nthrough  increased  agricultural  production,  thereby  reducing  food \ninsecurity  and \nincomes.  The \nimmediate  objective  is  better  use  of  water  resources  and \npromotion  of  irrigated  agriculture  through  (i)  a  comprehensive \npolicy  and  strategic  framework  to  be  applied  in  developing  water \nresources; (ii) a better understanding, knowledge, and application \nof the IWRM approach in a river basin context; (iii) improved water \nresource  management  through  rehabilitated/upgraded  small  to \nmedium-scale \nirrigation  schemes  and  other  water  control \ninfrastructure;  (iv)  strengthened  capacity  of  communities  and \ninstitutions  to  plan,  implement,  manage,  and  maintain  such \ninfrastructure;  and  (v)  improved  agricultural  support  services  to \nthe  beneficiary  water  users.  The  Project  will  have \nthree \ncomponents: \n(i) Institutional strengthening. The Project will continue previous \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support to the Ministry of Water \nResources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) in (i) further developing \nits policy and strategy framework, particularly in finalizing a water \nresources  investment  strategy  and  preparing  strategic  plans  and \nsubsequent annual strategic business plans; (ii) further developing \nand  refining  the  regulatory  framework  necessary  to  ensure \nsustainable  management  of  irrigation  systems  and  subsequent \ntransfer  to  farmer  water  user  communities  (FWUCs);  and  (iii) \nbuilding at national and provincial levels the capacity to adopt and \napply an IWRM approach in a river basin context. \n(ii)  Irrigation  infrastructure  development  and  management. \nThis component will support (i) water use studies in selected river \nbasins of the four target provinces; (ii) identification, prioritization, \nand  selection\u2014using  an  IWRM  approach  in  a  river  basin \ncontext\u2014  of  10  to  12  small  to  medium-scale  (less  than  3,000 \nhectares)  irrigation  subprojects;  (iii)  the  feasibility study, detailed \ndesign  and  construction  of  the  selected  subprojects;  and  (iv) \norganization  of  the  subproject  beneficiaries  into  FWUCs,  and \ntraining  and  strengthening \nto  ensure \nsustainable  management,  and  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation \n\nthese  communities \n\n\fv \n\nsustainable  management,  and  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation \nschemes. \n(iii)  Support  to \nirrigated  agriculture  development.  This \ncomponent  will  maximize  the  benefit  from  the  investment  by \nensuring  delivery  of  support  in  improving  rice  production,  crop \ndiversification,  integration  of  livestock  and  fisheries,  and  rural \ncredit to the subproject beneficiaries by (i) assisting and training  \nthe  agricultural  extension  services  at  the  subproject  district  level, \nand (ii) fielding a cadre of irrigation extension workers to facilitate \nthe delivery of these support services within the subproject areas \nand  to  maintain  direct  and  regular  field  contact  with  the \nbeneficiaries to guide them. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $30.9  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $10.5  million  (34%)  as  foreign  exchange,  and  $20.4 \nmillion equivalent (66%) as local currency. \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement \nGovernment \n\nBeneficiaries  \nTotal \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange  Currency \n\nLocal \n\n7.38 \n\n3.10 \n\n \n\n \n\n10.62 \n\n0.64 \n\n6.88 \n\n2.25 \n\nTotal \nCost \n18.00 \n\n3.74 \n\n6.88 \n\n2.25 \n\n      % \n58 \n\n12 \n\n22 \n\n7 \n\n10.48 \n\n20.39 \n\n30.87 \n\n     100 \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  various  currencies \nequivalent to $18.00 million from its Special Funds resources. The \nloan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 31 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010 \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM) \nwill be the Executing Agency.  \n \nInterministerial  coordination  will  be  achieved  through  the  project \nsteering  committee \nin  2002,  currently \n(PSC)  established \nfunctioning for other irrigation projects funded by ADB and Agence \nFrancaise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  and  in  the  process  of  being \nelevated to the status of a national PSC. The PSC is chaired by a \nrepresentative (undersecretary of state level) from the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) and comprises of a national project \ncoordinator  from  MOWRAM  (undersecretary  of  state  level)  as \nsecretary, and representatives (undersecretary of state or director \nlevels)  of  concerned  line  ministries.

A project management office \n(PMO)  headed  by  a  national  director  (undersecretary  of  state \nlevel)  has  already  been  established  within  MOWRAM \nto \nimplement several ongoing projects of a similar nature. This PMO \nwill  assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementing  the  Project, \nusing  its  current  staff  and  drawing  additional  key  staff,  as \nnecessary,  from  relevant  MOWRAM  departments.  A  dedicated \nproject  manager  will  be  appointed  to  head  the  PMO  team \nspecifically assigned to the Project. The Provincial Department of \nWater  Resources  and  Meteorology  (PDWRAM)  in  each  project \nprovince will set up a project implementation unit (PIU) headed by \na  suitably  qualified  person  and  assisted  by  staff  seconded  from \neach  of  the  concerned  line  agencies.  A  provincial  project \ncoordination  committee  chaired  by  a  provincial  deputy  governor \nwith  representation  from  concerned  provincial  line  agencies  will \nensure  effective  coordination  between  the  agencies  directly \ninvolved in the project activities. \n \nMonitoring  of  the  environmental  aspects  will  be  the  responsibility \nof  (i)  an  environment  management  unit  (EMU)  to  be  established \nwithin  PMO  at  the  central  level,  and  (ii)  the  PIU  at  the  provincial \nlevel,  to  which  an  environment  specialist  from  the  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Environment  will  be  seconded.  The  existing \nResettlement Unit currently established within PMO of MWORAM, \nassisted by the resettlement working groups already formed at the \nprovincial  level,  will  implement  and  monitor  the  resettlement  and \nland planning activities of the Project.  The subproject beneficiary \ncommunities will form FWUCs and subordinate water user groups \n(WUGs) to be registered with commune councils. \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  for \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $1,000,000 equivalent, and \nthrough  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  for  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  $1,000,000  or  less.  Vehicles,  equipment,  and \nmaterials  will  be  procured  by  ICB  where  the  cost  is  more  than \n$500,000  equivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  (IS)  where  the \ncost  is  $100,000\u2013$500,000.  Small  or  off-the-shelf  goods  and \nmaterials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  using \ndirect purchase arrangements.  \n \nThe  AFD  grant  will  finance  approximately  366  person-months of \nconsulting  services  (133  international  and  233  domestic),  in  the \nfields  of  project  management,  institutional  and  water  policy \ndevelopment,  legal  aspects,  regulation  on  irrigation  management \ntransfer, resettlement and land management, hydrology and river \nbasin  development,  water  resources  management,  irrigation \ndesign  engineering  and  construction  supervision,  environmental \nmanagement,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nagriculture extension, training, community development and water \nuser formation, and rural credit. Consultants to be financed by the \n\n\f \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nvii \n\nuser formation, and rural credit. Consultants to be financed by the \nAFD grant will be engaged in accordance with AFD\u2019s procedures, \nwith  ADB\u2019s  endorsement  of  their  competence  and  experience. \nADB will finance consulting services to carry out specific activities \nrelated  to  surveys  and  studies,  preparation  of  detailed  designs, \nand  supervision  of  construction  works.  The  Project  will  also \ncontract the services of local institutions and local or international \nnongovernment  organizations \nfor  community  development, \nspecialized  training,  and  external  monitoring  of  the  resettlement \nactivities.  All  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. \n \nThe immediate benefit from the Project is increased productivity\u2014\na yield response of approximately 100% is realistically achievable \nthrough  improved  water  management.  This  response  will  be \nexpressed as increased household incomes for farmers with large \nareas  of  irrigated  land.  In  the  case  of  poor  households,  it  will \nmean  improved  food  security  through  the  dry  season,  thus \nreducing the extent of localized food deficits common throughout \nthe  northwest  region.  The  greatest  benefit  will  come  from \nincreased  cropping  options  with  a  more  secure  and  better-\nmanaged  water  supply.  While  benefits  have  been  assessed \nprimarily on the incremental paddy yields for both wet season and, \nwhere  possible,  dry  season  cropping,  more  diversified  cropping \nactivities  made  possible  by  a  reliable  water  source  will  result  in \nfurther  gains  in  household  incomes.  The  average  incremental \nfamily income in the sample representative subproject of the Po Pi \nDeum  scheme  is  estimated  at  $275  per  annum  from  higher \nyielding varieties of wet season rice and different vegetables. The \nProject will result in improved irrigation for nearly 35,000 hectares, \nfor  120,000  beneficiaries  in  about  15%  of  the  total  potential \nirrigation  command  area  for  the  four  project  provinces,  or  about \n40% of the total area currently under irrigation. \n \nThe  social  development  aspect  of  the  Project  extends  beyond \nincremental  household  incomes.  Farmer  beneficiaries,  including \npoor  and  vulnerable  sections  and  particularly  women,  will \nparticipate  actively  in  the  project  activities  and  will  be  organized \nand empowered through WUGs and FWUCs group initiatives. The \nProject will have direct beneficial impacts on poverty reduction by \n(i)  improving  food  security  for  rice-deficient  households,  (ii) \nimproving  access  to  irrigation  for  poor  and  marginal  farmer \nhouseholds  with  the  construction  of  tertiary  and  quaternary \ncanals,  (iii)  improving  the  access  of  landless  households  to  rice \nlands  through  lease  of  expanded  irrigated  land,  (iv)  facilitating \naccess  to  rural  credit,  (v)  improving  access  to  dry  season  water \nsupplies for domestic purposes, and (vi) reducing the incidence of \nwaterborne  diseases  with  better  water  management.  Moreover, \nthe  registration  of  landholdings  with  the  district  administration, \nland \nwhich  will \n\ntake  place  during \n\nresettlement  and \n\nthe \n\n\fviii \n\ntake  place  during \n\nland \nwhich  will \nconsolidation  processes,  is  a  legal  means  of  assuring  ownership \nand tenure. \n \n\nresettlement  and \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nimproved \n\nthe  onset  of \n\ninfrastructure;  and \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major  potential  risks  include  those  related  to  (i)  slow  adoption  of \nthe  concept  of  IWRM  to  river  basin  development  and  its \nrequirements;  (ii)  delayed  project  benefits  due  to  slow  farmer \nadoption  of  improved  irrigated  agricultural production techniques, \nwater  management  practices,  and  product  diversification \n(including  livestock  and  fisheries);  (iii)  inadequate  sustained \nmaintenance  of \n(iv) \nunderestimation  of  the  capital  investment  needed  to  rehabilitate \nirrigation  infrastructure.  These  risks  will  be  minimized  by  (i) \ndisseminating  and  promoting  river  and  basin  development \nconcepts  at \nthe  Project  and  substantially \nstrengthening  the  concerned  line  agencies;  (ii)  focusing  on \nexisting  irrigation  schemes  where  resident  knowledge  of  irrigated \nagriculture exists and where improved security and management \nof  water  supplies  will  decrease  the  risk  management  issues  in \ndetermining cropping activities and testing  improved methods of \nproduction; (iii) cooperating closely in ongoing programs operating \nin  the  subproject  areas  and  providing  agricultural  extension \nservices;  (iv)  involving  early  and  in  a  sustained  manner  the \nbeneficiary farmers through substantial investments in community \nthe  continuing \ndevelopment  and  human  capital  and \ndevelopment of end-user ownership; and (v) thoroughly  screening  \nthe  identified  candidate  subprojects,  and  adopting  of  an  iterative \nselection  and  prioritization  process \n(through  successive \ncomprehensive feasibility studies, detailed survey and design, and \ncost  estimate)  leading  to  the  ultimate  approval  of  a  subproject \ninvestment before to implementing it. \n \n\nin \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Northwest Irrigation Sector Project. 1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nCambodia  is  one  of  the  least  developed  countries  in  Asia  with  an  annual  per  capita \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  $282  (2001),  a  gender  development  index  of  0.551  (2001), \nand a human development index of 0.556 (2001) resulting in a ranking of 130th in the lowest tier \nof the medium human development category.2 About 36% of Cambodia's population live below \nthe  poverty  line.3  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  greater  in  rural  areas  (estimated  at  more  than \n40%)  where  about  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  are  found.  The  characteristics  of  poverty  differ \nacross  the  country,  but  its  incidence,  however  defined,  is  higher  in  the  rural  areas  of  the \nnorthwest. \n \n3. \nCambodia  is  predominantly  an  agrarian  society,  with  agriculture  accounting  for  39%  of \nGDP. At least 70% of the rural population directly depend on agriculture for  their livelihood. The \nsector has an important role to play in reducing rural poverty, meeting the expected population \ngrowth (2.4% per year), and improving nutritional requirements. Agricultural productivity remains \nlow compared with that in other Southeast Asian countries with similar agro-climatic conditions. \nIt is constrained by soil fertility, limited access to and thus use of farm inputs (particularly quality \nseed  material,  fertilizers  and  chemicals),  the  uncertainty  of  rainfall  and  frequent  occurrence of \ndroughts  and  flooding,  the  inability  to  manage  extreme  water  flows,  and  a  weak  agricultural \nextension  service  that  limits  farmer  exposure  to  and  adoption  of  improved  production \ntechniques. Furthermore, the poor rural road network results in high transport costs; restricted \naccess  to  markets,  market  information,  and  credit;  and  generally  lower  farmgate  prices  for \nfarmers  fortunate  enough  to  generate  surpluses  above  household  requirements.  Rice,  the \nstaple  crop  of  Cambodia,  covers  about  90%  of  the  2.6  million  hectares  (ha)  cropped  area, \ncontributing  46%  of  agricultural  output  and  providing  70%  of  nutritional  intake.  In  average  to \ngood years, Cambodia is considered barely self-sufficient in rice, but this is only true nationally \nand sufficiency at provincial level varies considerably (in 2001, 13 out of 24 provinces reported a \ndeficit).4  Many  rural  households,  especially  in  the  northwest  region,  continue  to  suffer  rice \ndeficits for up to 6 months of the year.5 \n \n4. \nCambodia is considered a \u201cwater wealthy\u201d country because of its location in the Lower \nMekong Basin and a gross water resource of nearly 50,000 cubic meters per person per year. \nHowever, with high variability in rainfall, lengthy dry seasons, and sporadic drought spells during \n\n                                                 \n1   The project preparatory technical assistance was provided under ADB. 2001.

Furthermore,  flooding, \nespecially  in  the  Mekong  floodplain  and  the  Tonle  Sap  lowlands  are  common  during  the  rainy \nseason.  In  this  current  water-insecure  situation  and  with  a  high  portion  of  poor  farmers  being \nsubsistence producers, their approach to rice production is one of risk minimization reflected by \ntheir  reluctance  to  accept  and/or  invest  in  innovation  and  changes  in  production  patterns. \nSecured water supplies throughout the entire growing season and better water management are \ntherefore  prerequisites  for  (i)  reducing  farmers\u2019  exposure  to  variability  in  crop  yields  and \ntherefore  to  food  insecurity,  especially  in  the  more  remote,  disadvantaged,  and  poorer  areas; \nand (ii) raising agricultural production and rural incomes in more advantaged areas where food \nshortage  is  less  of  a  problem  and  where  crop  diversification  and  commercially  oriented \nagriculture could be promoted. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 54% of agricultural output and \n31% of the total rice production \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nWater  Sector  Institutional  Framework.  The  Government  upgraded  the  Directorate \n5. \nGeneral of Irrigation, Meteorology and Hydrology within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and \nFisheries  (MAFF)  to  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  in  1999, \nwith a mandate to plan and manage the use and conservation of Cambodia\u2019s water resources. \nWith  assistance6  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  MOWRAM  has  achieved  steady \nprogress  toward  establishing  a  legal  and  policy  framework  (Appendix  1)  to  guide  the \ndevelopment of the water sector, including the irrigation subsector; however, further institutional \nstrengthening is required for the development of water policies and laws and improvement in the \ncapacities of institutions to implement them. \n \n6. \nCompetition for Water and a River Basin Perspective. Cambodia\u2019s water sector legal \nand policy framework has provision for managing water resources in a river basin perspective, \nbut this has not yet been implemented. Even though there has been little development of upper \ncatchment resources, competition among water users has been an ongoing issue, especially in \nthe  northwest.  In  addition,  competition  for  water  is  likely  to  increase  because  of  urban  areas, \nhydropower,  irrigation,  and  residual  stream  flow  requirements  to  maintain  ecosystems  and \nfisheries, especially in the Tonle Sap and Mekong River systems. Water resources planning and \nmanagement  need  a  river  basin  development  perspective  to  ensure  that  water  is  used  to \nachieve the greatest net economic and social benefit, while preventing conflict and competition, \ncreating  an  environment  conducive  to  satisfying  present  and  foreseeable  demands,  and \nsustaining environmental requirements. This is best done through the adoption of an integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM)7 approach. The Government has promoted the principles \nof IWRM in a river  basin context, but needs further resourcing and institutional capacity building \nto operationalize the approach. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 1999.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for \nPreparing the Northwest Irrigation Sector Project (Part A: Capacity Building in the Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology). Manila. \n\n7   Integrated  water  resources  management  is  a  process  to  improve  the  planning,  conservation,  development,  and \nmanagement of water, forest, land, and aquatic resources in a river basin context, to equitably maximize economic \nbenefits and social welfare without compromising environmental sustainability. It is based on comprehensive water \nresource  assessments  of  river  basins,  analysis  of  quantity  and  quality  concerns  for  these  resources  and  of \nopportunities for their conjunctive use, and prioritization of interdependent water resource developments. \n\n\f3 \n\nIrrigated Agriculture and Irrigation Infrastructure.  The higher yields achieved on the \n7. \nlimited  existing  irrigated  areas  substantiate  the  importance  of  supplemental  irrigation  and  of \nbetter water resources management. Irrigation development therefore represents, especially in \nthe  northwest,  a  means  of  reducing  crop  failure,  raising  crop  yields  and  productivity  and \ncropping  intensities  (thus  securing  rice  production),  and  allowing  diversified  production \noptions\u2014all  subsequently  reducing  rural  poverty  through  food  security  and  increased  farm \nincomes.  About  950  existing  surface-fed  irrigation  schemes  have  been  inventoried  in  19948 \nwithin  Cambodia.  The  potential  command  area  was  estimated  at  473,000  ha,  of  which  only \n256,000  ha  were  fully  irrigable.  Only  21%  of  the  schemes  were  fully  operational  and  a  further \n14% were either nonoperational or nonoperable. Many irrigation schemes, including those that \nwere  constructed  during  the  Khmer  Rouge  regime  in  the  late  1970s,  were  damaged  after \ndecades of neglect, receiving neither routine nor periodic maintenance, and were in urgent need \nof  rehabilitation.  In  recent  times,  some  rehabilitation  initiatives  occurred  and  were  largely \nfinanced  from  external  assistance  (Appendix  2).  The  four  northwest  provinces  of  Pursat, \nBattambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap account for 22% of the country\u2019s population \nand  33%  of  its  agricultural  land.  More  than  100  existing irrigation schemes identified in these \nprovinces have an estimated total potential command area of 234,000 ha, with only 85,000 ha \ncurrently irrigated.  \n \n8. \nStakeholder  Participation  in  the  Irrigation  Subsector.  In  June  2000,  MOWRAM \nissued  Prakas  (Instruction)  3069  that  provides  a  framework  for  introducing  of  an  irrigation \nmanagement transfer (IMT) process to increase participatory management and to rationalize the \nsharing  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  between  the  government  and  beneficiary \ncommunities.  Prakas  306  covers  (i)  the  formation,  registration,  and  strengthening  of  farmer \nwater  user  communities  (FWUCs)10  and  subordinate  water  user  groups  (WUGs);  (ii)  their \nempowerment in managing irrigation schemes, particularly in collecting irrigation service fees to \ncover the cost of water delivery and scheme O&M; and (iii) the gradual and phased transfer of \nresponsibility  for  O&M  to  FWUCs  and,  eventually,  ownership  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure. \nActual  implementation  of  Prakas  306  varies  widely  between  provinces,  districts,  and  even \nschemes. Only about 100 FWUCs have been formed nationwide to date and are functioning to \na limited extent only. \n \nPoverty  in  the  Northwest.  Until  1998,  much  of  the  northwest  was  controlled  by  the \n9. \nKhmer Rouge and was inaccessible to both aid and development agencies. It was thus left out \nof many development initiatives (largely aid-funded) that during the past decade were directed \nto the south and east of the country nearer to Phnom Penh. The northwest provinces are among \nthe  poorest  in  Cambodia,  with  average  provincial  poverty  level  ranging  from  24%  to  54%  and \npockets of poverty reaching up to 60% and more. Official statistics report an adult literacy rate of \n68.5% for the nation and 46.2% for the northwest. That figure that is probably overstated as it \nincludes people who are only partially literate. Only 1.25% of the rural population have access to \n\n                                                 \n8   Halcrow  et  al.  1994.  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Study  in  Cambodia,  Inventory  and  Analysis  of  Existing  Systems. \n\nPhnom Penh: Mekong Secretariat/UNDP. \n\n9   Prakas  (Instruction)  306  includes  (i)  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Circular  No.  1  dated  11  January  1999  on  the \nImplementation  Policy  for  Sustainable  Irrigation  Systems  that  contains  model  statutes  for  the  establishment  and \nfunctioning of FWUCs and provisions on the assessment and collection of irrigation service fees; (ii) the Policy for \nSustainable  Operation  and  Maintenance  2000  describing  the  objectives  and  principles  of  sustainable  irrigation \nmanagement; and (iii) a description of the steps in forming  FWUCs. \n\n10  FWUCs are intended (i) to bring together farmers who are farming land in an irrigated area and form a group for \nfacilitating the supply of irrigation water; (ii) to supply adequate water for irrigation to its members; (iii) to acquire \nknowledge of the management, maintenance, and operation of the irrigation system including financial matters; (iv) \nto increase yields and cropping intensity; and (v) to facilitate support from the government (intervention when they \nmeet obstacles, like natural hazards, and marketing problems). \n\n\f4 \n\nsafe drinking water and sanitation.

The Project is in \n10. \nline  with  the  government\u2019s  vision  and  development  goals  articulated  in  the  Second  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP-II) and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS),11 \nwhich  are  both  summarized  in  the  sector/subsector  analysis  in  Appendix  1.  The  Project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  that  supports  the  government's  goal  of \npoverty  reduction  through  three  priority  areas  (rural  economic  development,  human  resources \nand  social  development,  and  private  sector  development)  and  10  sectors  and  subsectors.12 \nInvestment in rural infrastructure (including irrigation systems) and agricultural support services \nconstitute  a  major  thrust  in  the  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  between  ADB  and \nCambodia.13  The Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  a  multisectoral approach in \nand around the populous rural areas of the Tonle Sap14 where the majority of the poor live, and \nis closely linked to the ongoing ADB-financed Northwestern Rural Development Project15 that is \naddressing  rehabilitation  of  the  rural  road  network  and  rural  infrastructure  at  the  village  level. \nSynergy  has  been  sought  with  other  ongoing  or  planned  aid-financed  initiatives  in  agriculture, \nrural  development,  and  natural  resource  management.16  Finally,  the  Project  is  fully  consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s water policy.17 \n \n11. \nLessons Learned.  Several past and ongoing programs (Appendix 2) implemented by \nMOWRAM have yielded relevant lessons and valuable experiences. The following key lessons \nhave  been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the  Project:  (i)  a  river-basin  approach  to  the \nmanagement  of  water  resources  should  be  taken  in  areas  with  potential  scarcity  of  water;  (ii) \nsecured  and  properly  managed  water  supply  that  reduces  production  risk  is  a  prerequisite  for \neffective  diffusion  of  improved  agriculture  technologies  and  crop  diversification;  (iii)  to  develop \nend-user ownership and promote sustainable participation in scheme management and O&M, \nbeneficiaries should actively participate at all stages of project preparation and implementation; \nand  substantial  investments  in  community  and  human  capital  development  are  needed,  for \nwhich  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  can  play  a  crucial  role;  (iv)  rigorous \nselection/prioritization of the schemes, proper planning, and sound designs and cost estimates \nare  needed  to  avoid  underachievement  and  cost  overruns  during  implementation;  (v)  more \ncompact  and  institutionalized  arrangements  for  project  implementation  are  better  than  project-\nspecific  arrangements  in  terms  of  coordinated  management,  more  efficient  performance, and \nless  demand  on  scarce  managerial  staff;  and  (vi)  addressing  resettlement  and  land \n\n                                                 \n11  The Royal Government of Cambodia. 2002.

The immediate  objective \nis  better  use  of  water  resources  and  taking  advantage  of  the  potential  for  irrigated  agriculture \nthrough  (i)  a  comprehensive  policy  and  strategic  framework  to  be  applied  in  developing  water \nresources; (ii) better understanding, knowledge, and application of the IWRM approach in a river \nbasin  context,  particularly  in  predicting  and  mitigating  impacts  of  irrigation  development \n(especially  the  cumulative  impact  and  interdependence  of  schemes  in  a  common  basin)  on \nwater  resources  and  the  aquatic  ecosystem;  (iii)  improved  water  resource  management  by \nrehabilitating/upgrading  small- \nirrigation  schemes  and  other  water \nmanagement  infrastructure;  (iv)  strengthened  capacity  of  communities  and  institutions  to  plan, \nimplement,  manage,  and  maintain  such  infrastructure;  and  (v)  improved  agricultural  support \nservices to the beneficiary water users. The project framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nto  medium-scale \n\n13. \nTo  meet  its  objectives,  the  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  water  sector  institutional \nstrengthening,  (ii)  irrigation  infrastructure  development  and  management,  and  (iii)  irrigated \nagricultural development. \n \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening in the Water Sector \n\n14.  Water  Resources  Policy  and  Strategic  Framework.  The  Project  will  continue  to \nsupport  MOWRAM  in  further  developing  a  policy  and  strategic  framework  and  asserting  its \nstatutory  leading  role  in  the  water  sector  with  the  long-term  objective  of  enabling  it  to  (i)  plan, \nprioritize, and guide external investments in accordance with the government\u2019s sectoral policies \nand  plans  and  promote  their  consistent  application  across  all  projects;  and  (ii)  coordinate \ninteragency  cooperation,  especially  where  multiple  agencies  are  working  in  the  same  river \nbasins.  More  particularly,  the  Project  will  assist  MOWRAM  in  (i)  finalizing  the  water  resources \ninvestment  strategy  using  a  consultative  process  that  includes  all  stakeholders  (other \ngovernment agencies involved in water related investments and their provincial offices, NGOs, \ninternational  organizations,  aid  agencies,  etc.);  (ii)  organizing  and  conducting  regular \ngovernment-aid  agency  forums  to  discuss  ongoing  and  planned  investments;  and  (iii)  further \ndeveloping its strategic development plans and subsequent annual investment plans. \n \nRegulatory Framework for Irrigation Management Transfer.  MOWRAM  and  the  aid \n15. \ncommunity  recognize  the  need  for  coordinated  development  of  the  policy,  legal,  financial,  and \nadministrative  framework  for  IMT.  Particular  attention  is  required  to  clarify  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  all  IMT  stakeholders;  the  scope  and  modalities  for  handing  over  irrigation \ninfrastructure and transferring O&M responsibilities, which will depend on the type and size of \nirrigation  schemes;  the  form  of  legal  agreements required between MOWRAM and FWUCs to \n\n\f6 \n\nregulate the transfer; water use and scheme ownership rights for FWUCs; and the procedures \nfor calculating and collecting irrigation service fees. \n \n16. \nThrough  the  French  Government-funded  Support  for  the  Development  of  Agriculture \nSector  Policies  Project,18  MOWRAM  recently  constituted  an  interministerial  irrigation  working \ngroup (Appendix 1) with the mandate to refine the national IMT policy and to prepare regulatory \ndocuments\u2014water  law  and  subdecrees\u2014and  ministerial  instructions  necessary  for  their \nimplementation. The group will also (i) develop operational guidelines for a practical process of \nFWUC establishment and registration; (ii) establish a coordination forum where lessons learned \nand experiences on FWUC  matters from all government or externally funded interventions are \ncapitalized and exchanged, providing continuous feedback for national policy development; (iv) \ndevelop  and  institutionalize  a  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  assess  the \nmanagement  and  development  of  all  irrigated  areas;  and  (v)  ensure  that  appropriate  budgets \nand trained staff are made available for implementing IMT. The Project will support the group by \nproviding (i) international expertise (one water policy adviser and one IMT  specialist) to assist in \nreviewing  and  improving  the  IMT  regulatory  framework,  (ii)  resources  for  organizing  and \nconducting  coordination  workshops,  (iii)  resources  to  carry  out  case  studies  on  FWUC \nexperiences within the country, and (iv) in-country study tours and field visits for the members. \n \n17. \nIWRM  Approach  in  River  Basins.  MOWRAM  and  its  provincial  departments  have \nalready  achieved  an  impressive  record  in  project  implementation,  having  benefited  from  ADB \ncapacity-building  assistance.19 Nonetheless, a wide range of knowledge and awareness needs \nto be developed to adopt and apply an IWRM approach in a river basin context. The Project will \naddress  these  weaknesses.  Much  of  the  needed  expertise  and  experience  will  be  gained  by \nMOWRAM  and  provincial departments of water resources and meteorology (PDWRAMs) staff \nthrough (i) focused training, guidance, and specifically designed courses in disciplines such as \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  integrated  water  resources  planning,  and  river \nbasin management, to be delivered by consultants recruited under the Project; (ii) direct on-the-\njob  training  by  working  alongside  consultants  and  technical  staff  in  disciplines  covering \nengineering,  agronomy,  economics,  sociology,  hydrology,  and  environmental \nimpact \nassessment  during  the  preparation  of  river  basin  water  use  studies,  subproject  feasibility \nstudies,  and  detailed  design;  and  (iii)  formal  training  at  international  and  local  institutions  in \nproject  management,  English  language,  and  computer  skills,  together  with  regional  and \ndomestic  study  tours.  In  addition  to  intensive  training  to  develop  individual  capabilities, \nMOWRAM  and  PDWRAMs  require  additional  facilities  and  equipment  to  effectively  adopt  and \napply  an  IWRM  approach  in  a  river  basin  context as well as to carry out project activities and \ndevelop  their  operational  capacity.  The  Project  will  provide  for  hydrological  measuring \nequipment,  upgrading/construction  of  office  facilities,  vehicles,  equipment,  and  operational \nresources for national and provincial offices. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  The  Support  for  the  Development  of  Agriculture  Sector  Policies  Project  is  financed  by  the  French  Government \nthrough the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 Prioritaire. The project aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the ministries \nconcerned  with  the  agriculture  sector  (mainly  MAFF,  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD),  and  MOWRAM)  to \nenable them to develop well-defined sector strategies focusing primarily on poverty reduction and food security for \nthe rural population. The selected priority issues include land tenure security,  irrigation management, reforestation, \nand farmers organizations. \n\n19  ADB.  1999.

In the first stage of the selection process, 35  eligible subprojects (Appendix 5) \nthat  include  four  core  subprojects  studied  during  project  design  were  identified  in  the  project \nprovinces.  The  Project  will  provide  funds  for  rehabilitating  and  improving  or  constructing  the \nselected  subprojects,  including  all  costs  for  preparation  (feasibility  studies  and  detailed  survey \nand design), construction and supervision of civil works, all necessary environmental mitigation \nmeasures,  and  resettlement  requirements  (compensation  under  the  latter  will  be  government-\nfinanced). \n \n19. \nRiver Basin and Water Use Studies. The Project will finance four water use studies in \nselected priority river basins of the target provinces.21 Besides providing staff of MOWRAM and \nPDWRAM with practical exposure to IWRM and river basin development concepts, the studies \nwill (i)  give  an  assessment  of  the  overall  water  resources  availability,  use,  and  demand;  (ii) \nidentify existing as well as planned water resource infrastructure and their interdependence; and \n(iii)  assist  in  selecting  for  further  survey  and  feasibility  study  under  the  Project  candidate \nsubprojects that are unlikely to generate detrimental effects on downstream water users or be \nadversely affected by other planned water resources development activities. \n\n20. \nStand-Alone  Schemes.  There  is  also  significant  potential  for  rehabilitation  of  stand-\nalone  small  to  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes  that  typically  draw  water  from  a  reservoir \nsupplied  by  one  discrete  catchment.  Rehabilitating  such  schemes  is  not  expected  to  result  in \nnegative downstream impacts on water availability or preclude future development possibilities. \nAmong  the  35  eligible  subprojects,  17  stand-alone  schemes  were  identified  for  further \nconsideration (Appendix 5). \n \nFive  core  subprojects  were  studied  to  feasibility  level  during  project  preparation.22 One \n21. \n(Ponley-Banteay  Meanchey)  is  considered  suitable  for  proceeding  to  detailed  design.  For  the \nLink  Canal  (Battambang)  and  Po  Pi  Deum  (Banteay  Meanchey)  subprojects,  additional \ninformation  from  the  Mongkol  Borei  basin  water  use  study  is  required  before  proceeding  to \ndetailed survey and design. The final selection of the Link Canal subproject is also subject to (i) \nconfirmation  of  the  development  of  an  incremental  2,000  ha  of  irrigated  land  in  the  command \n\n                                                 \n20  Flood  spreading  is  a  flood  water  management  practice  that  consists  of  diverting  excess  water  overtopping  the \nspillway of a reservoir embankment during high-intensity  rainfall  episode  to  a  downstream  network  of  drains  that \ndistributes and eventually spreads this floodwater over an extended command area before land preparation. \n\n21  The  Project  will  finance  water  use  study  for  the  following  river  basins:  (i)  the  Mongkol  Borei  river  located  in  both \nBattambang and Banteay Meanchey, (ii) the combined Boribo-Srang-Thlaemaom rivers system in Pursat, (iii) the \ncombined Daun Tri-Svey Don Keo rivers system located in both Pursat and Battambang, and (iv) the Svay Chek \nriver in Banteay Meanchey. \n\n22  Thlea Maom Scheme (rehabilitation of a river diversion scheme) in Pursat; Link Canal Scheme (construction of a \ntransfer  canal  to  increase  the  water  supply  to  an  existing  reservoir)  in  Battambang;  Po  Pi  Deum  Scheme \n(redesigning  an  irrigation  scheme  and  rehabilitating  key  water  control  infrastructure);  Ponley  Scheme \n(rehabilitating/upgrading a reservoir and its command area) in Banteay Meanchey; and Stung Chikraeng Scheme \n(rehabilitating/upgrading a reservoir and its command area) in Siem Reap. \n\n\f8 \n\narea below the Kamping Puoy Reservoir by an Italian Government-financed project expected to \nstart  early  in  2004,  and  (ii)  additional  survey  and  design  of  a  section  of  the  reservoir \nembankment  in  need  of  rehabilitation.  The  fourth  core  subproject  (Stung  Chikraeng-Siem \nReap)23 similarly requires (i) revision of the feasibility study in view of the request of Siem Reap \nprovincial  authorities  to  adopt  a  phased  approach  in  its  development,  (ii)  a  comprehensive \nresettlement  plan,  (ii)  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  to  ADB  standards,  and  (iii) \nreconfirmation  of  the  economic  and  financial  analyses  before  the  subproject  can  proceed  to \ndetailed design. The remaining core subproject (Thlea Maom-Pursat) was rejected on grounds \nof poor economic returns as well as engineering and environmental considerations. Overall, it is \nestimated  that  some  10  to  12  subprojects  will  be  implemented  under  the  Project.  This  is \nestimated to result in improved water availability and management to irrigate nearly 35,000 ha,24 \ninvolving 120,000 beneficiaries on about 15% of the total potential irrigation command area for \nthe four project provinces, or about 40% of the total area currently under irrigation. \n \n22. \nResettlement. Most selected subprojects will require varying degrees of land acquisition \nand  compensation  for  houses  and  other  assets  along  new  or  widened  canal  alignments  and \nenlarged  reservoirs.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement (1995) and \nHandbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice  (1998),  and  in  consultation  with  the \nInterministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC)  established  under  the  Council  of  Ministers,  a \ngeneric resettlement framework (RF) (Appendix 6) and model resettlement plans (RPs) for the \nstudied  core  subprojects  (Appendix  7)  were  prepared  to  guide  preparation  of  future RPs for \neach subproject. \n \n23. \nLand  Adjustment  and  Consolidation.  Rehabilitating  and  upgrading  the  irrigation \nschemes will, in most cases, rationalize and improve irrigation and drainage canals, especially \nfor  tertiary  and  quaternary  canals  in  the  command  area.  This  task  will  be  achieved  through  a \nparticipatory  resolution  process  involving  farmers  and  local  authorities  (at  commune,  district, \nand village levels) and facilitated by the provincial and district staff of PDWRAM and Provincial \nDepartment of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (PDLMUPC). The process \nwill be initiated at the detailed design stage of selected subprojects and will result in a registry of \nlandholdings  and  ownership  to  be  held  at  district  land  registration  offices,  and  provide  a \nlegitimate  entry  point  for  cadastral  survey  and  a  land  titling  certification  process  by  the \nmandated Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC).25 \n \n\nb. \n\nFarmer Water User Communities and Operation and Management \n\nThe  Project  will  support  government  policy  to  achieve  sustainability  in  irrigation  by \n24. \nstrengthening  beneficiary  communities  capacity  for  management  and  O&M  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure and gradually transferring to them those responsibilities and ultimately ownership \nof  the  schemes.  It  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  PDWRAM  staff  in  community  and  group \norganization,  establishment  of  WUGs  and  FWUCs  (consistent  with  the  operational  rules  and \nregulations  developed  under  the  institutional  strengthening  component),  irrigation  scheme \n                                                 \n23  An  independent  feasibility  study  of  Stung  Chikraeng  Scheme  was  commissioned  by  the  Agence  Francaise  de \n\nD\u00e9veloppement in its capacity as potential cofinancier of the Project. \n\n24  Including an estimated 19,000 ha of flood spreading (footnote 23) and flood recession (paddy grown in reservoir as \nthe  water  level  recedes)  production  area  and  an  estimated  16,000  ha  of  irrigated  command  area  (full  control \nirrigation), of which about 5,000 ha will be double-cropped (dry season cropping). \n\n25  A  national  program  of  cadastral  survey,  registration,  titling  and  certification  of  title  based  on  the  Land  Law \npromulgated  in  August  2001  has  been  started  by  MLMUPC  with  the  joint  support  of  World  Bank,  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technique Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), and the Government of Finland. The program is progressing in \neach of the project provinces and is conducted at district level by the District Land Offices under the management \nof PDLMUPC. \n\n\f9 \n\nmanagement, water management, and irrigation scheduling. PDWRAM staff will also be trained \nto  conduct  FWUC  and  WUG  training  in  management  and  O&M  procedures,  as  well  as  in \naccounting and financial planning and reporting, conflict resolution, and mainstreaming gender \nand vulnerability issues. \n \n25. \nThe Project recognizes the  limited resources of PDWRAM in this area and will enlist the \nprivate  sector  to  further  support  the  establishment  and  strengthening  of  farmer  organizations. \nKey  to  the  successful  implementation  of  this  subcomponent  will  be  the  fielding  of  a  cadre  of \nirrigation  extension  workers  (IEWs)  to  supplement  PDWRAM  staff  at  field  level  to  work  with \nFWUCs  and  WUGs  established  in  each  subproject.  The  IEWs  will  be  engaged  by  qualified \nNGOs26 contracted to (i) field for each subproject scheme an irrigation extension team (IET) with \nexpertise  in  community  organization  (including  gender  development  and  mainstreaming), \nirrigation  water  management  and  agricultural  production,  and  irrigation  scheme  management \nand  O&M;  (ii)  train  FWUC  management  and  members  in  operational  matters;  (iii)  assist  in \nestablishing and strengthening the FWUCs, including negotiating formal agreements that outline \nimplementation  and  the  IMT  process  between  MOWRAM,  local  authorities,  and  FWUCs;  (iv) \nthe \nassist  project \nresettlement  and  land  adjustment/consolidation  process;  and  (v)  support  the  irrigated \nagricultural development component. \n \nIn  collaboration  with  ongoing  irrigation  interventions,  MOWRAM  has  developed  initial \n26. \nguidelines and training modules. These will be used as a starting point, but will be refined and \nimproved  through  pilot  implementation  and  through  the  outcomes  of the capitalization work of \nthe interministerial irrigation working group (para. 16). \n \n\nimplementation  unit  (PIU)/PDWRAM  and  PDLMUPC \n\nfacilitating \n\nin \n\n3. \n\nDeveloping Irrigated Agriculture \n\n27. \nThe  Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (PDAFF)  and  their \nDistrict Agricultural Office (DAO), are  responsible for providing agricultural extension services, \nbut  severely  lack  resources.  The  Project  will  (i)  provide  technical  training,  basic  office \nequipment,  and  mobilization  support  for  DAOs;  and  (ii)  field  IETs  (para.  25)  to  facilitate  (as \ninterfaces)  the  delivery  of  government  extension  services  in  subproject  areas .  The  training \nprogram  will  incorporate  wet  season  and  dry  season  paddy  production,  integrated  farming \nsystems, improved irrigated agriculture, and on-farm water management practices. Associated \nwith  the  technical  training,  collecting  market  information  and  mechanisms  for  disseminating  it \nwill be enhanced, using local media and market notice boards. \n \nImproved  Agricultural  Extension.  In  close  coordination  with  other  programs,27  the \n28. \nProject  will  assess  training  needs  and  develop  an  extension  training  program  for  PDAFF  and \nDAO  staff  to  complement  the  technical  training  and  improve  their  effectiveness  as  extension \nstaff.  Technical  and  extension  training  for  target  district  staff  will  begin  simultaneously  with \nconstruction in each subproject. Cross visits between relevant subprojects will be an important \npart of the training for farmer representatives and IETs. At farmers level, the Project will support \nparticipatory  farmer-led  extension  processes  through  FWUCs,  involving  members  directly  in \n\n                                                 \n26 Through the country\u2019s experience in participatory development over the past 15 years a substantial number of local \nand international NGOs as well as domestic independent experts are now skilled and experienced in participatory \nand community organization techniques. Assessment of NGOs in the project area is presented in paras. 29 and 30 \nof Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n27  The  International  Fund  for  Agriculture  Development-financed  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila,  the \nAustralian-financed  Cambodia  Australia  Agriculture  Extension  Project,  the  future  European  Union-financed \nECOSORN Project, the future ADB-financed Agriculture Sector Development Program. \n\n\f10 \n\ninvolved \n\ntrained,  and \n\nleaders  will  be \n\ndisseminating  information  as  well  as  demonstrating,  assessing,  and  testing  improved \ntechnologies.  Farmer \nin  organizing \nidentified, \ndemonstration  plots  on  their  own  farms  to  be  used  as  bases  for  farmer  field  schools  and  in \ncoordinating  farmer  training  and  field  days,  to  provide  opportunities  for  further  interaction \nbetween farmers and extension staff at critical periods of the growing season. \n \n29. \nImproved Rice Seed Production. The Project will promote farmer involvement in seed \nproduction  to  increase  the  availability  of  early  maturing  paddy  varieties  and  maximize  the \nadvantage  of  improved  water  availability.  It  will  train  DAO  agronomists  in  testing  seed  for \ngermination  and  purity.  Selected  farmers  will  be  trained  in  seed  production  with  subsequent \nregistration.  To  establish  a  seed  pool,  other  volunteer  farmers  will  be  encouraged  to  multiply \nseed on their own farms using small quantities of improved seed supplied by the Project. With \ntechnical  support,  a  seed  certification  procedure  in  each  province  will  be  developed  so  that \nfarmers can achieve higher prices for certified seed that they produce. \n \n30. \nImproved  Livestock  and  Fisheries.  Livestock  rearing  is  an  important  part  of  rural \nlivelihoods  in  terms  of  nutrition,  and  draft  power.  It  is  a  means  of  wealth  accumulation  and \nreserve.  Each  province  has  a  Livestock  Disease  Diagnostic  Laboratory  that  is  currently  not \noperating  at  full  capacity  due  to  lack  of  funds. The Project will reactivate these laboratories to \nprovide improved diagnostic services. It will also train and give the village livestock assistants in \nthe project area basic veterinary kits to improve animal health services to farmers. Similarly the \nProject  will  support  fishery  initiatives,  as  improved  control  of  natural  waterways,  rehabilitated \nirrigation  canals,  and  better  water  management  in  paddy  fields,  that  will  allow  diversifying  into \nfish raising activities, thus reducing pressure on natural stocks. \n \n31. \nAccess to Rural Credit.  Within the framework of the feasibility study to be prepared for \neach subproject, rural credit access will be studied and a support program developed to address \nidentified constraints, with particular attention to the needs of households with female heads and \nother vulnerable households. The Project will review alternate credit options and help bridge the \ngap between formal credit institutions28 and individual FWUCs and WUGs.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  assist  MOWRAM  in  adopting  an  IWRM  approach  to  river  basin \ndevelopment  by  financing  water  resources  assessments  and  water  use  studies  in  selected \npriority  basins  to  better  understand  the  link  between  water  and  land  resource  use,  the \nenvironment,  and  sustainable  development  at  the  basin  level.  The  data  will  establish  the \nparameters for prioritizing future water-related investments, a process that will be reinforced in \nselecting candidate irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated under the Project. \n \nThe Project will support the development of irrigated agriculture as a recognized means \n33. \nof reducing poverty in the short term in rural areas by way of (i) reducing farmers\u2019 exposure to \nvariability  in  crop  yields  and  therefore  to  food  insecurity  in  more  disadvantaged,  remote,  and \n\n                                                 \n28  Licensed  or  registered  microfinance  institutions  such  as  Hattha  Kaksekar  (Pursat,  Banteay  Meanchey  and  Siem \nReap),  and  Seilanithih  (Pursat,  Battambang,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Siem  Reap)  operating  in  the  project area, the \nPRASAC  Credit  Association  that  will  be  operating  in  the  project  area  from  March  2003.  The  EU-financed \nECOSORN  is  under  preparation  and  is  expected  to  include  a  rural  credit  component.  Several  international  and \nlocal NGOs are successfully implementing microfinance projects in some areas of northwestern Cambodia such  \nas Catholic Relief Services in Battambang, Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) active in the \nnorthwest; and World Vision nationwide. On a larger scale, Acleda Bank, which is a specialized bank licensed by \nthe National Bank of Cambodia as a microfinance institution, is operating nationwide. \n\n\f11 \n\nthen \n\nrehabilitating \n\nIWRM  approach,  and \n\nthe  schemes  using  an \n\npoorer  areas  where  annual  food  deficits  are  common;  and  (ii)  promoting  economic  growth \nthrough  enhanced  agricultural  production  and  rural  incomes  in  areas  where food security has \nbeen  achieved  and  where  crop  diversification  (including  high-yielding  and  aromatic  rice \nvarieties) and commercially oriented agriculture can be promoted. The Project will also adopt a \nmore  integrated  approach  to  irrigation  development  that  will  begin  with  identifying  and \nprioritizing \nthem. \nSimultaneously,  sustainability  of  the  investment  will  be  ensured  by  supporting  beneficiary \nparticipation  in  selection,  management,  and  O&M  of  the  schemes  and  in  progressive  IMT.  To \neffectively take on such an approach, the Project will support investments on a scale that can be \nmanaged and maintained (at least partially) by local beneficiary communities and developed as \na  comprehensive  agricultural  system.  Finally,  irrigated  agriculture  extension  services  will  be \nsupported  and  strengthened  to  achieve  more  efficient  use  of  the  delivered  water  and \noptimization of the investment.  \n \n34. \nGiven  that  the  Government  does  not  have  the  resources  to  engage  and  retain  the  full \nrange  of  skilled  personnel  to  undertake  water  resource  development  and  management  within \nMOWRAM,  the  Project  will  assign  certain  implementation  duties  to  more  specialized  entities \noutside  the  public  sector.  In  the  past,  monitoring  and  supervision,  and,  to  a  certain  extent, \nimplementing  activities  depended  very  much  on  the  presence  of  consultants  engaged  through \nprojects. Consulting services envisaged here will instead focus on supporting and strengthening \nthe  capacity  of  MOWRAM  and  its  provincial  departments  to  efficiently  plan,  monitor,  and \nsupervise the works and services provided by execution partners contracted from (i) the private \nsector  (i.e.  domestic  consulting  and  construction  firms,  NGOs);  and  (ii)  specialized  local \ninstitutions and organizations. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n35. \nThe project cost, inclusive of contingencies and taxes and duties, is estimated at $30.9 \nmillion  equivalent,  comprising  $10.5  million  (34%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $20.4  million \nequivalent  (66%)  in  local  currency.  The  Project  will  not  finance  recurrent  costs,  other than the \nincremental  annual  operating  costs  of  management  support  and  a  part  of  the  infrastructure \nmaintenance  costs  during  the  initial  years  of  implementation  (summary  cost  tables  are  in \nAppendix 8). \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nIt is proposed that ADB provides a loan of $18 million equivalent from its Special Funds \n36. \nresources to finance about 58% of total project costs, including $10.6 million equivalent of local \ncurrency.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with an \ninterest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter. \nAgence  Francaise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  has  agreed,  in  principle,  to  provide  parallel \ncofinancing in a grant amounting to $3.7 million equivalent (about 12% of the total project cost) \nto cover the costs of a portion of consulting services. The Government will finance $6.9 million \nequivalent  (about  22%  of  the  total  project  cost),  which  includes  about  $2  million  for  taxes  and \nduties,  the  balance  being  mainly  for  resettlement,  demining,  a  portion  of  structures  and \nearthworks,  and  part  of  the  maintenance  costs  of  rehabilitated  infrastructure.  The  beneficiary \ncontribution  is  estimated  at  $2.3  million  (7%  of  total  cost)  equivalent  comprising  in-kind \ncontribution  of  labor  for field distribution earthworks plus a share of O&M costs during project \nimplementation.  \n \n\n\f12 \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Organization and Management \n\nfor \n\nIrrigation  and  Rural \n\nthe  ADB/AFD-funded  Stung  Chinit \n\nAppendix  9  presents  the  project  management  and  implementation  structures,  and  the \n37. \nimplementation  process.  A  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  institutional  framework  at  national \nand  local  levels  and  the  detailed  design  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements  are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix C. The Project will be implemented over 6 years (2004-\n2010) and a summary implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n38. \nProject Coordination and Management at Central Level. Successful implementation \nof the Project will require the cooperation of several ministries.29 Interministerial coordination will \nbe  achieved  through  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  established  in  2002  and  currently \nfunctioning \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  and  planned  to  be  used  for  the  AFD-funded  Prey  Nup  Polders \nRehabilitation Project. This PSC is in the process of being elevated to the status of a national \nPSC and the Government intends it to continue to function beyond project implementation. It is \nchaired  by  a  representative  (undersecretary  of  state  level)  from  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance  (MEF),  and  comprises  a  national  project  coordinator  from  MOWRAM  (undersecretary \nof  state  level)  as  secretary  and  representatives  (undersecretary  of  state  or  director  levels)  of \nconcerned  ministries.30  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  direction  of  the  Project  and \ninteragency coordination, and will meet at least twice a year.  \n \n39.  MOWRAM will be the Executing Agency, as it is the ministry with a mandate for planning \nand  managing  the  use  and  conservation  of  Cambodia\u2019s  water  resources.  MOWRAM  has \nincreased its technical and project management skills considerably through practical experience \nin  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  other  agencies  (Appendix  2)  and  has  satisfactorily  executed \nthose  projects.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  was  established  within  MOWRAM  to \nmanage and implement ongoing projects.31 MOWRAM will appoint a dedicated project manager \nin the PMO to head a team comprising technical and administrative staff. The PMO will assume \noverall  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the  Project  using  current  PMO  staff  and  drawing \nadditional  specialist  staff  (on  a  part  or  full  time  basis  as  required)  from  relevant  MOWRAM \ndepartments. The PMO will be responsible for day-to-day management issues. \n \n40. \nProject  Management  and  Coordination  at  Provincial  Level.  Four  PIUs  will  be \nestablished in PDWRAM in the project provinces to be headed by a full-time provincial project \nmanager\u2014with qualifications acceptable to ADB and AFD-assisted by seconded staff from each \nof the relevant line agencies.32 Each PIU will have technical and administrative staff and access \nto PDWRAM\u2019s technical specialists from other sections as required. The PIU will be responsible \nfor  day-to-day  management  of  project  activities  at  the  provincial  level.  Provincial  coordination \nwill  be  achieved  through  a  provincial  project  coordination  committee  (PPCC)  chaired  by  a \nprovincial deputy governor and comprising representatives (director level) of the provincial line \n\n                                                 \n29  MAFF,  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  MOWRAM,  MLMUPC,  MRD,  Council  for  the  Development  of \n\n30  MEF,  MOWRAM,  MAFF,  MOE,  MLMUPC,  MRD,  Ministry  of  Public  Work  and  Transport,  and  Council  for \n\nCambodia. \n\nDevelopment of Cambodia. \n\n31  The  PMO  is  currently  managing  the  ADB-financed  Emergency  Flood  Rehabilitation  Project  (to  be  completed  in \n2003), the Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project (to be completed in 2007), and the World Bank-\nfinanced Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project (to be completed in 2004). \n\n32  Provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Provincial Department of Land Management, Urban \n\nPlanning and Construction; and Provincial Department of Environment. \n\n\f13 \n\ndepartments directly concerned with the Project. Similar interagency coordination arrangements \nare  functioning  satisfactorily  under  the  ongoing  ADB/AFD-funded  Stung  Chinit  Irrigation  and \nRural  Infrastructure  Project.  After  the  screening  process,  all  qualifying  investments  proposed \nunder  the  Project  will  be  referred  by  the  PIU  to  PPCC  for  approval  before  final  ratification  by \nMOWRAM, ADB, and AFD. \n \n41. \nEnvironmental  Impact  Monitoring.  An  Environment  Management  Unit  (EMU)  will  be \nestablished  within  the  PMO  and  staffed  by  one  environmental  specialist  (seconded  from  the \nMinistry of Environment [MOE]) and one sociologist. Similarly, at the provincial level, each PIU \nwill have one environmental specialist seconded from the Provincial Department of Environment \n(PDE).  The  EMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  guiding  and  monitoring  the  preparation  of  IEE \nrequired  for  each  subproject  at  feasibility  stage  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  (Supplementary  Appendix  D);  (ii)  timely \nsubmission  of  IEEs  to  the  concerned  environmental  agencies,  ADB  and  AFD,  for  clearance \nbefore  detailed  design  and  construction  begin;  (iii)  ensuring  that  recommended  environmental \nmitigation measures recommended in the IEEs are incorporated into the design and civil works \ncontracts  and  in  subsequent  operations  of  subprojects;  and  (iv)  ensuring  that  environmental \nmonitoring is adequately reported in project review and progress reporting. Seconded PDE staff \nin  PIUs  will  (i)  assist  in  preparing  individual  subproject  IEEs,  (ii)  ensure  adoption  of \nrecommended  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  (iii)  monitor  water  quality  in  all \nsubproject locations, and (iv) report environmental monitoring results to the EMU. International \nand  domestic  environmentalist  specialists  recruited  under  the  Project  will  help  building  the \ncapacity of central and provincial environmental units.  \n \n42.  Monitoring Resettlement and Land Planning. During design preparation, resettlement \nworking groups were established in all target provinces except Siem Reap. Each group consists \nof  representatives  from  PDWRAM  (3),  PDAFF  (2),  and  PDLMUPC  (2).  Implementation \nprocedures (as detailed in the agreed-upon RF) that have been established will be continued in  \npreparing  the  RPs  required  for  noncore  subprojects.  MOWRAM\u2019s  Resettlement  Unit33 will be \nresponsible  for  (i)  supervising  the  provincial  working  groups  in  the  landholding  identification \nsurveys,  socioeconomic  surveys,  detailed  measurements  for  identifying  affected  people,  and \nland adjustments/consolidations resolution process required for the RPs and that will take place \nin  conjunction  with  the  feasibility  study  and  subsequent  detailed  engineering  design;  and  (ii) \npreparing  the  RPs  and  submitting  them  to  the  IRC,  ADB,  and  AFD  for  endorsement  and \nsubsequent  implementation  through  MEF.  Execution  of  the  RPs  will  be  monitored  externally \nunder  contract  to  suitably  qualified  NGOs.  One  output  of  the  boundary  identification  and \nlandholding surveys and subsequent adjustment will be a landholding registry maintained at the \ndistrict  land  registration  offices  for  subsequent  use  in  the  issue  of  land  tenure  certificates  and \ntitles. \n \n43.  Water  Resources  Multiuser  Committees.  Multiuser  committees  for  management  of \nwater  resources  will  be  established  at  basin  level  where subprojects draw water from sources \nthat  are  used  by  others  (e.g.,  interbasin  transfer  canals,  river  barrages,  and  medium-  size \nreservoirs). Apart from actual water users, such committees will have the representatives from \nthe  relevant  local  government  (e.g.,  district  or  commune),  and  provincial  departments.

Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \nmore  than  $1,000,000  equivalent  will  be  awarded  through  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) procedures, and contracts costing $1,000,000 or less through local competitive bidding34 \n(LCB).  Vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be \nprocured  through  ICB,  and  those  valued  $500,000  or  less  through  international  shopping  (IS). \nSmall or off-the-shelf goods and materials valued at less than $100,000 may be procured using \ndirect purchase arrangements. The contract packages are presented in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  AFD  grant  will  be  used  to  finance  approximately  366  person-months of consulting \n45. \nservices (133 international and 233 domestic), in the fields of project management, institutional \nand  water  policy  development,  legal  aspects,  irrigation  management  transfer  regulation, \nresettlement  and  land  management,  hydrology  and  river  basin  development,  water  resources \nmanagement,  irrigation  design  engineering  and  construction  supervision,  environmental \nmanagement,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  agriculture  extension,  training, \ncommunity  development  and  water  user  formation,  and  rural  credit  (areas  of  expertise  and \nstaffing  schedule  are  in  Appendix  12,  and  detailed  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  AFD-financed  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  AFD\u2019s \nprocedures. ADB will endorse the selection and engagement of the consultants based on their \ncompetence and experience. \n \nConsultant  financed  by  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n46. \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. ADB will finance topographic surveys, river basin studies, socioeconomic \nsurveys, environmental impact assessments, detailed engineering design, economic analyses, \nand  supervision  of  construction  works.  Domestic  consulting  firms  with  access  to  international \nexpertise,  and  individual  domestic  consultants  will  carry  out  these  activities.  The  firms  will  be \nrecruited using the quality- and cost-based selection procedures. ADB will also finance activities \nrelated to community development, specialized training, and external monitoring of resettlement \nactions.  The  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  NGOs  (domestic  and  international)  and  local \nspecialized  institutions.  Where  the  number  of  qualified  NGOs  or  institutions  is  limited,  direct \nselection  may  be  applied  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB  and  AFD.  MOWRAM,  with  the \nassistance  of  the  AFD-financed  consultants,  will  prepare  the  detailed  terms  of  reference  and \ncost estimates for each ADB-financed consultancy contract. \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThrough  budgetary  allocation,  the  Government  will  make  available  the  proceeds  of  the \n47. \nloan  to  the  PMO  and  the  PIUs  to  pay  eligible  project  items.  To  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness, open and maintain with the National Bank of Cambodia a first-generation imprest \naccount  for  the  PMO.  Concurrently,  a  second-generation  imprest  account  for  the  PIUs  will  be \n\n                                                 \n34  Eligible bidders under LCB include provincial and national entities. \n\n\f15 \n\nopened  with  a  recognized  commercial  bank,  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  each  of  the  four  project \nprovinces. Opening of all five imprest accounts will be subject to the appointment of a qualified \naccountant (at MOWRAM level) and administrative staff (at PIU level) and the establishment by \nMOWRAM  and  four  PIUs  of  accounting  systems  and  internal  control  acceptable  to  ADB  in \naccordance  with  the  Project  Accounting  Manual  issued  by  MEF  (23  June  1998)  and  its \namendments.  Each  imprest  account  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  The  initial  total  amount  in  each  second-generation \nimprest account will not exceed $50,000, while the ceiling of the first generation-imprest account \nwill  not  $1,000,000.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse \nexpenditures and liquidate imprest accounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000 for the \nfirst-generation  imprest  account  and  the  ceiling  of  $10,000  for  the  second-generation imprest \naccounts. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n48. \nThe PIUs will submit to the PMO monthly financial reports and quarterly progress reports \ndetailing  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  activities  against  the  targets  and  summarizing \nproject  performance.  In  turn,  the  PMO  will  submit  to  MOWRAM for onward submission to the \nGovernment,  ADB,  and  AFD  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  (including  environmental \nmonitoring)  and  a  comprehensive  annual  progress  report.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion,  the  PMO  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  and  AFD  a  project  completion  report,  in \nADB standard format. \n \n49.  Within 6 months after loan effectiveness, MOWRAM will establish a simple computerized \nmanagement  information  system  suited  to  project  needs  in  the  PMO  for  efficient  monitoring, \nfinancial management, and reporting of component progress and contracts. The PMO and PIUs \nwill  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  income  and \nexpenditures  relating  to  the  Project.  MOWRAM  will  compile  the  consolidated  project accounts \nand  related  financial  statements  to  be  audited  annually  by  independent  external  auditors \nselected through LCB and  acceptable to ADB and AFD.  The annual audit report will include a \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure.  Audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts,  together  with  the  report  of  the \nauditor, will be submitted to ADB and AFD within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n\n6. \n\nOperation and Maintenance  \n\nIrrigation  infrastructure  rehabilitated/constructed  under  the  Project  will  require  O&M35 \n50. \nduring  and  after  the  Project.  In  line  with  the  Government  policy  on  IMT,  the  beneficiaries\u2014 \norganized  in  FWUCs  and  WUGS\u2014will  be  responsible  for  overall  O&M  of  the  secondary  and \ntertiary canal and drain systems, while the Government will be responsible for the primary canal \nand drain systems and the headworks. The Government will also be responsible for emergency \nmaintenance  of  the  overall  infrastructure.  Loan  funds,  counterpart  funds,  and  beneficiary \ncontribution  will  fund  in  part  the  O&M  costs.  Loan  funds  will  be  provided  on  a  declining  share \n\n                                                 \n35  Maintenance  of  irrigation  schem es  comprises  of:  (i)  routine  maintenance  covering  small-scale work needed on a \nroutine  basis  throughout  the  year  and  responsibility  for  which  can  be  entirely  transferred  to  the  beneficiaries;  (ii) \nperiodic maintenance covering more substantial repairs that needs to be planned when the system is shut down; \n(iii)  emergency  maintenance  covering  urgent  or  temporary  repairs  to  maintain  water  delivery  following  sudden \nfailure of the system. Organization and financing of the latter two categories are usually outside the capacity of the \nbeneficiary communities. \n\n\f16 \n\nover  time,36  while  counterpart  funds  and  beneficiary  contribution  will  increase  proportionally  to \nmeet  full  maintenance  requirements  by  project  completion.  To  ensure  timely  disbursement  of \ngovernment  counterpart  funds,  a  maintenance  account  will  be  established  in  each  project \nprovince to be replenished annually from a budgetary allocation (or other available national or \nprovincial sources).  Disbursement  from  these  maintenance  accounts  will  be  jointly  managed \nand  monitored  by  the  respective  PDWRAMs  and  PIUs  and  regularly  reviewed  by  the  PMO, \nADB, and AFD. The accounts will be subject to a separate audit opinion (as part of the overall \nproject  annual  external  audit).  Similar  arrangements  will  be  used  for  participating  FWUCs: \nirrigation  water  fees  collected  will  be  deposited  to  facilitate  timely  disbursement  of  beneficiary \ncontribution to maintenance. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nThe  Project  will  adopt  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  A \ncomputerized management information system will be developed and implemented to monitor \nand  evaluate  the  implementation  performance  and  development  impacts  of  the  Project  at \nvarious  stages  of  its  cycle.  The  system  will  build  on  the  experience  gained  (i)  in  developing  a \ncomputerized database system under previous ADB-financed technical assistance,37 (ii) through \nthe  baseline  surveys  and  data  collected  during  the  study  of  the  core  subprojects,  and  (iii)  the \nbenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  for  other  ADB-financed  projects  implemented  by \nMOWRAM.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nDuring the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB, AFD, and the Government will jointly carry \n52. \nout  semiannual  reviews  to  (i)  determine  if  all  proposed  implementation  arrangements  are \nappropriate  and  in  place;  (ii)  assess  progress  in  selecting  the  subprojects;  (iii)  review  the \nresettlement  and  land  adjustment  program;  (iv)  review  the  study,  design,  and  construction \nprograms;  and  (v)  review  the  conduct  and  outcomes  of  the  capacity  building  and  training \nactivities. At the end of year 3, ADB, AFD, and the Government will undertake a comprehensive \nmidterm review in consultation with the PSC. Before this midterm review, the PMO will prepare \na comprehensive report identifying issues for the mission\u2019s consideration.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\n53. \nThe  immediate  benefit  from  the  Project  is  increased  productivity\u2014a  yield  response  of \napproximately 100%\u2014that is realistically achievable through improved water management and \navailability  and  technological  changes  in  production.  It  will  be  expressed  as  increased \nhousehold incomes from improved productivity and diversification for farmers with larger areas \nof  irrigated  land.  In  the  case  of  poor  households,  it  will  mean  improved  food  security  and \nreduced localized food deficits that are common in the more remote areas of the northwest. The \ngreatest  benefit  will  come  from  increased  cropping  options  with  a  more  secure  water  supply. \nWhile benefits have been assessed primarily on the incremental paddy yields for both wet and, \nwhere  possible,  dry  season  cropping,  diversified  cropping  activities  have  been  incorporated, \n\n                                                 \n36  For project costing purposes, the average figures of 100% for year 1 after completion of the subproject, 60% for \nyear 2, 40% for year 3, 20% for year 4, and none thereafter, for ADB\u2019s share of the O&M costs for each subproject \nhas  been  used.  However,  these  figures  will  be  revised  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  in  compliance  with  the \nagreement to be passed between the irrigation management transfer stakeholders of each particular scheme. \n\n37  Capacity Building in MOWRAM (footnote 33) and Northwest Irrigation Sector Project (footnote 19). \n\n\f17 \n\nwhere  marketing  options  permit,  resulting  in  further  gains  in  household  incomes.  The  average \nincremental  family  income  from  higher-yielding  varieties  of  wet  season  rice  and  vegetable \ndiversification in the sample subproject of Po Pi Deum is estimated at $275 per annum. \n \nEconomic analyses carried out for the core subproject show economic internal rates of \n54. \nreturn  (EIRRs)  between  14.3%  and  17.8%  (Appendix  13).  The  EIRRs  are  robust  to  delays  in \nbenefits  and  to  increases  in  the  capital  cost  of  the  subprojects.  There  are  adequate \nopportunities for developing subprojects of a similar nature, with relatively low capital investment \nin  small  to  medium-size  command  areas  that  will  ensure  reasonable  financial  and  economic \ninternal rates of return to justify a sector approach. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Benefits and Impact \n\n55. \nParticipation.  Participatory  consultations  initiated  during  project  preparation  and  loan \nprocessing stages will continue through FWUCs and subordinate WUGs during implementation \nto  ensure  that  (i)  design  of  delivery  and  drainage  canals  and  the  associated  land  adjustment \nprocess have the support of all beneficiaries, and (ii) the beneficiaries progressively participate \nin managing the scheme and assume control of their share of O&M. \n \n56. \nPoverty  Reduction.  The  project  provinces  are  among  the  poorest  in  Cambodia. \nAverage  provincial  poverty  levels  range  from  24%  to  54%,  with  numerous  pockets  of  poverty \nreaching  60%  and  higher.  The  rural  poor  comprise  marginal  farmer  and  landless  households, \nand  women  living  in  households  with  female  heads  (25%  of  households).  Food  insecurity  is \nrelated to lack of secure water supplies, loss of standing crops to natural disasters, as well as \nlack  of  access  to  productive  resources  and  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  have \ndirect  beneficial  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  improving  food  security  for  rice-deficient \nhouseholds;  (ii)  improving  access  of  marginal  farmer  households  to  irrigation  through  the \nconstruction of tertiary and quaternary canals; (iii) improving the access of landless households \nto rice lands through leasing of expanded irrigated land; and (iv) over a period of time, improving \nagricultural  incomes  through  diversification  of  production.  Poor  and  vulnerable  groups, \nparticularly women, will be able to participate in FWUCs and WUGs and benefit from training in \nwater management and agricultural practices and from facilitated access to rural credit provided \nby NGOs through extension workers deployed for these activities. \n \n57. \nOther  Social  Benefits.  The  social  development  aspect  of  the  Project  extends  beyond \nfood  security  and  incremental  household  incomes.  It  includes  (i)  empowering  farmers  through \nWUGs and FWUCs group initiatives\u2014training in group cohesion and management, participation \nof the poor and women in decision making, conflict resolution, etc., (ii) providing new economic \nopportunities  in  a  suitable  manner  for  beneficiaries;  (iii)  improving  access  to  dry  season  water \nsupplies  for  domestic  purposes;  and  (iv)  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases \nresulting  from  better  water  management.  The  registration  of  landholdings  with  the  district \nadministration  during  resettlement  and  land  consolidation  processes  is  a  legal  means  of \nassuring  ownership  and  tenure.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  assessment  is \npresented in Appendix 14. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Measures \n\n58. \nAn  overall  environmental  assessment  and  IEEs  for  three  representative  core \nsubprojects were carried out during project preparation (a sample summary IEE and sample full \nIEEs are in Supplementary Appendix F). Their conclusions indicate that the Project is unlikely to \nresult in any serious negative environmental impacts because (i) no subproject will be located \n\n\f18 \n\nwithin a forest, wildlife reserve, or sanctuary, or within the multiple use zone of the Tonle Sap \nBiosphere  Reserve;  (ii)  subprojects  will  be  limited  to  a  maximum  size  of  3,000  ha;  and  (iii)  all \nsubprojects  will  be  subject  to  an  IEE  (including  an  environmental  management  plan)  to  be \nreviewed and approved by MOE, ADB, and AFD before design and construction activities begin. \nEnvironmental assessment and review procedures (Supplementary Appendix D) were prepared \nin  accordance  with  the  newly  approved  ADB  Guidelines  for  Environmental  Assessment  and \nhave been approved by Government. \n \nD. \n\nRisks Assessment \n\n59. \nThe concept of IWRM to river basin development is still new in Cambodia and there is \na  risk  that  its  adoption  will  be  slow  and  not  as  comprehensive  as  desired.  Government \ncommitment is clear in its current water sector legal and policy framework and key MOWRAM \nand  PDWRAMs  staff  have  already  been  exposed  to  the  concept,  in  both  theoretical  and \npractical ways during project preparation. The Project also has adequate provision for additional \ncapacity building to ensure adoption and use of the approach. \n \n60. \nSlow  farmer  adoption  of  improved  techniques  of  irrigated  agricultural  production, \nwater  management  practices,  and  production  diversification  has  the  potential  to  delay  the \nproject  benefits.  The  subprojects  will  rehabilitate  existing  irrigation  schemes  where  a  resident \nknowledge  of  irrigated  agriculture  exists.  Also  with  improved  security  of  water  supplies,  risk \nmanagement  will  be  less  an  issue  in  determining  cropping  activities  and  testing  improved \nmethods  of  production.  In  addition,  extensive  investment  in  community  development  will  help \nfarmers\u2019  early  and  sustained  involvement  in  designing  and  implementing  on-farm  irrigation \nmanagement and irrigated agricultural extension, and in the continuing development of end-user \nownership. Furthermore, the Project will  work  closely  with  programs  already  operating  in  the \nsubproject areas and agencies that have already accumulated considerable experience in rice \nfarming systems.38 \n \n61. \nThere  is  a  risk  that  with  inadequate  maintenance,  the  anticipated  increase  in  crop \nyields  will  decline  to  pre-investment  levels.  Success  of  the  Project  requires  active  beneficiary \nparticipation  in  O&M  and  management  of  the  schemes  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \ninvestments  and  to  reduce  the  financial  burden  on  the  Government.  The  Project  directs \nsubstantial  resources  to  early  and  sustained  investment  in  human  capital  by  establishing, \nsupporting,  and  strengthening  FWUCs  and  subordinate  WUGs  and  developing  end-user \nownership. This investment will also require reviewing and refining current policies, strategies, \nand regulations relating to IMT. The Project also provides for maintenance of the rehabilitated \ninfrastructure and requires the government and the beneficiaries to shoulder a substantial share \nof maintenance expenditure immediately after rehabilitation. The Government has specifically  \nassured  regarding  the  timely  availability  of  counterpart  funds,  and  the  Project  will  monitor  the \nannual allocation to provincial maintenance accounts. \n \n62. \nThere is also a risk that a significantly greater than estimated capital investment will \neventually  be  needed  in  subproject  rehabilitation.  With  a  sector  lending  approach,  this  risk  is \nsomewhat diminished and will be addressed through (i) thorough screening during identification \nof  candidate  subprojects;  and  (ii)  an  iterative  selection  and  prioritization  process  through \nsuccessive  comprehensive  feasibility  studies,  detailed  survey  and  design,  and  cost  estimate \nleading to ultimate approval of a subproject investment prior to implementation. \n\n                                                 \n38  Including  the  International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI),  the  Cambodian  Agriculture  Research  Development \n\nInstitute (CARDI), the Cambodia-Australian Agricultural Extension Project, and AFD. \n\n\f19 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MOWRAM have given the \n\n63. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  before  the  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management  is \napproved  by  the  National  Assembly,  begin  the  work  to  prepare  the  required \nsubdecrees to define the statutes, rights, and duties of FWUCs and the process \nfor  IMT;  (b)  not  later  than  12  months  following  approval  of  the  Law  on  Water \nResources Management, promulgate and declare the Law on Water Resources \nManagement  effective;  and  (iii)  finalize  and  promulgate  these  subdecrees  not \nlater  than  6  months  after  the  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management  is \npromulgated. \nThe Government will provide counterpart funds for timely project implementation. \nThe Government will make timely submissions of annual budgetary appropriation \nrequests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  during  each \nproject implementation year. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  following  project  completion,  the  infrastructure \nconstructed/rehabilitated  under  the  subprojects  will  be  maintained  in  good \nworking  conditions.  To  this  end,  the  Government  will  continue  to  provide funds \nthrough budgetary allocations for its share of routine O&M, and for periodic and \nemergency maintenance of such infrastructure. \nThe  Government  and  MOWRAM  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  EMU  ensure  full \ncompliance of the Project with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, the \nGovernment\u2019s  laws  and  regulations,  and  best  environmental  practices;  and  that \nthe Project will meet the mitigation and monitoring requirements described in the \nagreed  upon  environmental  assessments  and  review  procedures;  and  (ii) \nadequate  budgetary  provisions  will  be  made  for  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  of  subprojects,  implementation  of  mitigation  measures,  environmental \nmonitoring,  and  institutional  arrangements  for  coordination  and  supervision  as \nidentified in the subproject IEEs. \nThe  Government  and  MOWRAM  will  remove,  at  their  own  cost,  all  mines  or \nunexploded  ordnance  suspected  to  exist  on  subproject  sites  (reservoirs, \nheadworks,  canals,  and  command  areas).  Further,  the  Government  and \nMOWRAM will engage the services of a reputable and experienced mine security \norganization,  acceptable  to  ADB  and  AFD,  to  confirm  whether  the  concerned \narea  is  clear.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no  subproject  rehabilitation  will \nstart until demining has been completed and certification to that effect has been \nobtained. \nThe  Government  and  MOWRAM  will  ensure \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws \nand  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  as  set  out  in  the \nagreed-upon  resettlement  framework.

Agricultural productivity is low compared with \nthat in other Southeast Asian countries with similar agroclimatic conditions because of, among \nothers,  the  highly  variable  rainfall,  limited  irrigation  development,  and  poor  performance  of \nexisting  irrigation  facilities.  Rice  is  the  predominant  crop  (90%  of  the  2.6  million  hectares  [ha] \ncropped  area)  accounting  for  46%  of  the  economic  value  added  in  agriculture  and  providing \nabout  70%  of  the  average  nutritional  intake  (estimated  at  151  kilograms  of  rice1). Wet season \nrice\u2013(yielding 3.2 million tons, or about 80% of total rice production) is grown between May and \nSeptember  on  the  extensive  central  floodplains  of  the  Mekong  River  and  the  lowlands  around \nthe Tonle Sap under rain-fed conditions and consists predominantly of local varieties preferred \nfor  domestic  consumption.  Because  of  the  flat  terrain  and  poor  drainage,  flooding  is  common \nand  wet  season  planting  begins  either  on  well-drained  areas  or  after  the  rainy  season  due  to \nlocalized  inundation.  Dry  season  rice  (0.8  million  tons),  consisting  of  high-yielding varieties, is \ngrown between December and March. It is the higher yielding and more profitable crop, most of \nwhich  is  marketed.  In  2000,  the  average  rice  yield  was  3.2  and  1.9  tons/hectare (t/ha) for dry \nand  wet  season  crops,  respectively\u2014well  below  levels  achieved  in  neighboring  countries.  In \naverage to good years, Cambodia is considered barely self-sufficient in rice, but this is only true \nnationally; sufficiency at the provincial level varies considerably (in 2001, 13 out of 24 provinces \nreported deficits).2 Due to the limited rural road networks (resulting in high transport costs and \nrestricted  access  to  markets)  and  localized  droughts  and  flooding,  many  rural  households, \nespecially in the northwest region, continue to suffer rice deficits for up to 6 months of the year.3 \n\nB. \n\nIrrigation Subsector \n\nCambodia  is  considered  as  a  water-wealthy  country  with  a  water  availability  of  nearly \n2. \n50,000 cubic meters per person per year. The wet season varies considerably from year-to-year \nand it is common for extended periodic droughts to occur during the rainy season and impose \nshortages  of  water  for  domestic  and  agricultural  purposes.  The  irrigated  land  area  is  currently \nestimated  at  19%  of  the  total  area  under  food  crop  production  (2.6  million  ha),  of  which  only \n0.26 million ha remain fully operational. Low dry season river flows (due to the deforestation of \ncatchments) and limited retention of water in upper catchments make extensive double-cropping \nimpractical  over  much  of  the  country,  and  certainly  in  the  northwest  region.  Irrigation  is  used \nmostly  to  supplement  rainfall  at  the  start  and/or  end  of  the  rainy  season  and  during  drought. \nNevertheless, irrigated areas yield 54% of total agricultural production and 31% of the total rice \nproduction.  Further  development  of  irrigation  will  lead  to  agricultural  intensification,  crop \ndiversification, and improved productivity in Cambodia. \n\nThe  Mekong  River  Commission  Secretariat4  in  1994  inventoried  about  950  irrigation \n3. \nschemes.  Their  total  estimated  potential  command  area  was  about  473,000  ha  but  they  were \n\n                                                 \n1  Helmers, K., 1997.

Many of the schemes were constructed under the Khmer \nRouge  regime  in  the  late  1970s.  They  were  often  predominantly  inappropriate  large-scale \nschemes, poorly designed and constructed, and difficult if not impossible to maintain. Most have \nnow fallen into disrepair and no longer function efficiently, if they ever did. Other older systems \nthat  worked  previously  have  become  damaged  or  broken  down  after  decades  of  neglect.  The \nirrigation  schemes  still  in  (partial)  operation  are,  in  principle,  operated  and  maintained  by  the \nusers, usually smallholders who are not often keen or able to take on this responsibility. In many \ncases,  support  is  provided  either  through  international  organizations  or  limited  government \nresources. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional  Framework  in  the  Water  Resources  Sector  and  the  Irrigation \nSubsector \n\n4. \nIn 1999, the Government established the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM) (Law 0699/98 of 23 June 1999\u2013Subdecree 58 of 30 June 1999), elevating it from \nthe  General  Directorate  of  Irrigation,  Meteorology  and  Hydrology  under  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF).  MOWRAM  is  responsible  for  defining  water \nresources  management  policies  and  strategies,  collecting  and  analyzing  data,  planning  water \nresource use, regulating water use activities that have a negative impact on the resource, and \nmitigating  the  impact  of  water-related  natural  disasters  such  as  floods  and  droughts.  The \nprevious directorate focused mainly on irrigation, hydrology, and meteorology, while MOWRAM \nnow has the broader responsibilities of developing and managing water resources. \n \nApart from MOWRAM, other ministries and agencies perform water-related management \n5. \nfunctions. The Ministry of Environment (MOE), with responsibility for water quality and pollution \ncontrol in public water areas, collects data, performs administrative and licensing functions, and \nmonitors  wastewater  discharges.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development (MRD) establishes rural \nvillage  wells,  and  collects  hydrogeological  data  and  submits  them  to  MOWRAM  for  the \npreparation  of  groundwater  maps.  MAFF  is  responsible  for  managing  forestry  resources  and \nfisheries/aquaculture. The Ministry of Industry, Mine and Energy (MIME) plans industrial water \nuses  and  the  generation  of  hydropower,  constructs  and  operates  provincial  water  supply \nutilities, and manages dedicated hydropower plants. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport \nconstructs  municipal  sewerage  systems,  collects  data  on  wastewater,  and  is  responsible  for \nriver  works  for  navigation  purposes.  The  Ministry  of  Health  is  responsible  for  the  quality  of \nsurface  and  underground  water  used  as  public  supplies.  The  Phnom  Penh  Water  Supply \nAuthority  collects  data  on  drinking  and  municipal  water  supplies  and  manages  water  supply \nutilities in the capital. The Cambodia National Mekong Committee coordinates water resources \nissues in the relations with the other riparian countries of the Mekong Basin. As overall manager \nof  water  resources,  MOWRAM  has  responsibilities  that  overlap  with  those  of  other  ministries \nand  agencies.  To  address  this  potential  conflict,  agreements  exist  between  MOWRAM  and \nMAFF, MRD, and MIME to delineate their responsibilities to specific aspects of water resources \ndevelopment.  The  draft  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management  also  addresses  the  issue  of \ninstitutional duplication. \n \n6. \nare as follows: \n \n\nMOWRAM\u2019s main  areas of activity  relating to the  management of  water for  agriculture  \n\n(i) \n\nManagement and development of river basins.  The  specific  tasks  are  to  (a) \nprepare  a  river  basin  inventory  and  database;  (b)  develop  an  approach  to  river \nbasin management and to test it in selected priority river basins; and (c) establish \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfor  sustainable  development  and \nand  promulgate  comprehensive  plans \nmanagement  of  water  resources  based  on  an  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement (IWRM) approach to river basin development. \nIrrigation  and  drainage.  MOWRAM  will  (a)  extend  the  area  served  by \nsustainable  irrigation  and/or  drainage  systems,  particularly  where  poverty \nincidence  is  high;  (b)  establish  community  and  beneficiary  participation  in  all \nstages of the development and management of irrigation and drainage schemes, \ndeveloping the necessary capacity in community organizations and/or the private \nsector;  (c)  facilitate  increasing  income  in  the  irrigated  agriculture  subsector  to \nensure  continued  investments  in  water  for  crop  production;  and  (d)  strengthen \nthe  technical  and  institutional  capacity of concerned departments to implement \nirrigation and drainage development. \nGroundwater  management.  In  this  area,  MOWRAM  will  (a)  develop  and \nenhance  the  national  groundwater  information  base;  and  (b)  develop  a \ngroundwater  monitoring  network  and  research  capability  for  groundwater-based \nirrigation in areas without surface water. \n\n(iv)  Mitigation  of  water-related  hazards.  MOWRAM  will  develop  and  implement  a \n\nnational strategy to mitigate floods and droughts. \n\n7. \nGiven  these  wide-ranging  responsibilities,  MOWRAM\u2019s  operational  effectiveness  is \nconstrained  by  limited  financial  and  human  resources  as  they  progressively  reorient  their \nactivities  from  physical  implementation  to  management  and  monitoring.  The  bulk  of  the  small \nbudgetary  allocation  is  directed  at  the  unrealistic  staff  salaries  with  little  or  no  allocation  for \nroutine,  periodic,  or  emergency  maintenance.  Most  investments  in  rehabilitation  have  come \nfrom internationally funded development projects. \n\n8. \nIn  line  with  its  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy,  the  Government  is \nincreasingly  devolving  responsibilities  to  provincial  departments  that  answer  to  both  their  line \nministry and to provincial governors. Provincial rural development committees are a potentially \npowerful  means  of  coordinating  water-related initiatives, as activities of provincial departments \ncan  be  more  effectively  supervised  at  the  provincial  level.  Similarly,  commune  councils  and \nvillage development committees are becoming increasingly important in water-related issues, as \nthey  directly  communicate  the  needs  of  individuals  and  families  for  access  to  drinking  water, \nwater for crop irrigation, or reduction of losses caused by floods and droughts. \n \nD. \n\nNational/Sectoral Policy and Strategy Framework \n\n9. \nThe  Government\u2019s  primary  development  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty,  and  the  Second \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP-II,  2001\u20132005;  officially  launched  in  July  2002)5 \npresents three policy objectives designed to do so: (i) foster broad-based, sustainable economic \ngrowth  that  will  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  poor,  with  the  private  sector  playing  the  leading \nrole; (ii) promote social and cultural development by improving access of the poor to education, \nhealth,  water  and  sanitation,  power,  credit,  markets,  information,  and  appropriate  technology; \nand (iii) ensure the sustainable management and use of natural resources and the environment. \nSEDP-II  emphasizes  the  importance  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  to  achieve  its \nobjectives,  identifying  water  resources  management  as  a  key  element  by  the  (i)  accelerated \nsustainable  development  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems;  (ii)  establishment  of  farmer  water \n\n                                                 \n5  The  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  2002.

Under the NPRS, land and water are seen \nas  the  two  natural  resources  fundamental  to  both  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction, \nespecially  in  the  rural  areas  where  people  in  agriculture  rely  on  them.  The  NPRS  recognizes \nthat  water  resources  management  and  irrigation  development  are  part  of  the  priority  actions \nrequired to implement the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. \n \n11.  With the assistance of ADB7 and the World Bank, 8 MOWRAM has achieved significant \nprogress  toward  establishing  a  legal  and  policy  framework  for  the  water  sector,  including  the \nirrigation  subsector,  and  in  developing  a  vision  for  national  water  resources  and  an  effective \nstrategic  approach  to  their  development  and  management.  Several  major  steps  have  been \ntaken in recent years and significant documents have been developed, including (i) a National \nWater Sector Profile (2001) that reviews and analyzes the existing situation in the water sector, \ntogether with a short- and long-term development perspective of the sector; (ii) a  draft Law on \nWater  Resources  Management  (2001)  and  supporting  implementation  subdecrees  to  regulate \nthe water sector management that has passed the Council of Ministers and has been submitted \nto the National Assembly for promulgation; (iii) a  draft  National Water Resources Policy (2001) \nto  provide  a  basis  for  managing  the  country\u2019s  overall  water  resources  and  for  developing \nsubsectoral  policies  and  strategies  that  has  been  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  for \ndeliberation; (iv) a draft National Water Resources Strategy (2001) that gives an extensive list of \nproposed objectives, strategies, and actions in all areas of the water sector for incorporation in \nthe  NPRS;  (v)  a  Strategic  Framework  for  the  Water  Sector  (2001)  based  on  the  agenda  for \nactions included in the National Water Sector Profile, and a number of MOWRAM strategic and \ninvestment  plans  to  effect  it;  and  (vi)  an  Investment  Strategy  for  the  Water  Resources Sector \nthat is in its early stage of preparation. \n \n12. \nAll those documents have direct or indirect links to and/or make considerable mention of \narrangements for developing and managing of water resources to support agriculture and crop \nproduction. The key strategies relating specifically to the irrigation subsector are summarized in \nparas. 13-16. \n\n13.  Water Resources Management. The aim is to prevent conflict and competition among \nwater  uses  and  development  for  different  purposes  (irrigated  agriculture,  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  hydropower,  fisheries,  etc.)  in  different  areas  (basin  and  subbasins)  and  create  an \nenvironment conducive to the satisfaction of present and foreseeable demands consistent with \nenvironment  protection  by  taking  these  steps:  (i)  plan  water  resource  use  and  sustainable \ndevelopment for the various purposes within priority areas (basin, subbasins, and aquifers) on \nthe  basis  of  available  data  and  follow  the  principles  of  IWRM  in  river  basin  development;  (ii) \nlicense  water  uses,  and  apply  specific  measures  to  recover  costs  from  end  beneficiaries  (i.e., \nwater fees and irrigation service fees); and (iii) control groundwater abstraction and use. \n\n                                                 \n6  The  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.

The  target  is  to  expand  operational  irrigated \n14. \nareas  from  19.5%  to  24%  of  the  total  cropped  area  by  the  year  2007  and  thus  enhance  food \nsecurity, provide job opportunities, and increase rural incomes, particularly in areas with a high \nincidence  of  poverty.  In  the  short  and  medium  term,  this  task  will  involve  (i)  rehabilitating\u2014 \nwhere  justifiable  on  technical,  economic,  and  social  grounds\u2014existing  irrigation  schemes, \nmainly  in  flooded  areas  and  priority  reservoirs  in  lowland  areas;  (ii)  developing  cost-effective, \nshort-gestation, appropriate and effective private irrigation technologies (i.e., small low-lift pump \nsystems); and (iii) developing small-scale smallholder gravity irrigation schemes. In the medium \nto  long  term,  infrastructure  development  will  involve  the  improvement  and  expansion  of  areas \ncovered by medium-scale and large irrigation schemes in the lowland areas as the institutional \ncapacity  for  planning,  construction,  management  and  operation,  and  maintenance  of  such \nsystems is developed. \n\nthe \n\nIrrigation \n\nInfrastructure.  To  ensure \n\nFinancial  Sustainability  of \n\n15. \nfinancial \nsustainability of irrigation infrastructure, arrangements for the participation of users in managing \nthe rehabilitated and newly constructed irrigation schemes will be introduced. This will require (i) \nimproving the participation of farmers, communities, stakeholders, and the private sector at all \nstages  of  the  development  and  management  of  irrigation  schemes;  (ii)  developing  a \ncomprehensive  regulatory  framework  for  beneficiary  involvement  in  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement  and  the  technical  and  financial  aspects  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nirrigation facilities (including recovery of service delivery and O&M costs through introduction of \nirrigation  service  fees);  (iii)  forming  and/or  strengthening  FWUCs  and  subordinate  water  user \ngroups  to  enhance  cooperation  among  farmers  in  operating,  maintaining,  and  managing  the \nschemes; (iv) introducing irrigation management transfer to gradually shift O&M responsibilities \nfrom MOWRAM to FWUCs; (iv) strengthening the capacity of local government and FWUCs in \nparticipatory irrigation management, development, and  O&M; (v) promoting crop diversification; \n(vi)  improving  rural  credit  access;  and  (vii)  implementing  the  land  titling  legislation  to  ensure \nsecurity of tenure and stimulate farmers to invest in O&M. \n\n16. \nCapacity Building. To create an enabling environment for IWRM and development, the \nfollowing  steps  will  be  taken:  (i)  elaborate  and  adopt  subdecrees  for  implementing  the  Water \nLaw;  (ii)  establish  an  interministerial  working  group  (comprising  MOWRAM,  MAFF,  MRD,  and \nMOE)  to  guide  the  development  of  and  investments  in  the  irrigation  sector  (para.  17);  (iii) \nstrengthen the capability within MOWRAM both at the central and at decentralized levels for all \nphases or development, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of irrigation schemes; (iv) \nstrengthen  the  database  and  information  system  of  MOWRAM  to  facilitate  integrated \nmanagement of water quantity and quality and determination of the balance between availability \nand  demand;  (v)  facilitate  increased  coordination  in  irrigation  investments  among  funding \nagencies; (vi) educate  the public about their rights, obligation, and responsibilities with regard \nto  sustainable  water  resources  management  through  public  meetings,  radio  broadcasts  and \nprinted  materials;  and  (vii)  promote  the  role  of  women  in  water  resources  management  and \nwater services delivery. \n \nE. \n\nInterministerial Working Group in Irrigation \n\n17. \nThe Government and the aid community recognize the need to better coordinate policy \ndevelopment   in  the  agriculture  sector. Through the Support for  the  Development  of  Sector  \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nframework \n\nPolicies Project,9 MOWRAM established an interministerial working group to refine the policy for \nsustainable  management  of  irrigation  systems  by  directly  involving  the  beneficiaries and other \nstakeholders.  The  objectives  of  the  working  group  cover  four  strategic  areas  necessary  to \nensure  sustainable  management  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems:  (i)  develop  the \nfor  delegating  of  management \ninstitutional \nresponsibilities; (ii) develop the financing mechanisms, including irrigation service fee collection \nand  government  contributions  for  O&M;  (iii)  support  government  institutions  through  training, \nprovision  of  advice,  audit,  and  other  specific  services,  and  intervention  in  the  case  of  natural \ndisasters, and (iv) develop a monitoring and evaluation system for assessing the performance of \nthe concerned stakeholders (government, user communities, other public and private agencies) \nin managing irrigated areas. \n \n\n(regulations  and  procedures) \n\n                                                 \n9  The  Support  for  the  Development  of  Agriculture  Sector  Policies  Project  is  financed  by  the  French  Government \nthrough the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 Prioritaire. The project aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the ministries \nconcerned with the agriculture sector (mainly MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM) to enable them to develop well-defined \nsector  strategies  focusing  primarily  on  poverty  reduction  and  food  security  for  the  rural  population.  The  selected \npriority issues include land tenure security, irrigation management, reforestation, and farmers organizations. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE \nTable A2.1: Assistance in Capital Investmentsa \n\nProject \n\nDuration \n\nSource \n\nType \n\n1.

The impact is mostly on agricultural land in the corridors of \nmain  and  secondary  or  branch  canals  and  drains  and  in  expanded  reservoirs.  Land  losses  in \ntertiary irrigated areas will generally be absorbed in voluntary land adjustment. \n \n2. \nThere  is  no  substantial  relocation  of  communities,  but  only  scattered  and  localized \nreplacement and relocation of houses built on canal embankments or in reservoirs by relatively \npoor households that migrated into these areas in recent years. \n \n3. \nThe impact of resettlement is more sensitive in the project areas because of the level of \npoverty of the affected and beneficiary populations\u2014 40\u201360% of the communities affected are \nclassified as poor or very poor2 and have food deficits for several months of the year. There is \nalso  a  high  level  of  landlessness,  often  affecting  people  who  have  settled  near  canals  and  in \nreservoirs. \n\nB. \n\nResettlement Policy and Principles \n\n4. \nThere  are  three  major  elements  in  current  national  resettlement policy and practice: (i) \nthe development of a Cambodian national policy and regulatory structure; (ii) adherence to the  \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement (1995) and  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good \nPractice  (1998)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  and  (iii)  enactment  of  the  30  August \n2001 Land Law and its subdecrees, which establish rights of land ownership and of entitlement. \nA Sub-Decree on Social Concessions gives the legal basis for allocating communal land for the \npurpose of reducing landlessness and poverty, and will be a basis for replacing land lost in the \ncontext of involuntary resettlement. \n \n5. \nA resettlement plan (RP) will be prepared for each selected subproject. In preparing the \nRPs,  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  work  in  consultation  with  the  affected  persons  (APs), \ncommune chiefs, and district and provincial resettlement officials and will take into consideration \nthe  land  grants  that  will  be  available  to  the  poor  in  the  project  districts  under the Social Land \nConcessions  Program.  The  RPs  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  draft  a  national  policy  in \nestablishing the following principles: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAdequate steps will be taken to minimize the impact of project works on APs and \ntheir land and structures and to mitigate any adverse effects (i.e., by choosing for \ncanals alignment and widths that minimize impact). \nAPs and their representatives will participate fully in project design and in \nplanning and implementing resettlement. They will be consulted both over \nsubproject works and timing and over resettlement proposals, and will participate \nfully in subproject design and works and in planning and implementing \nresettlement. For this purpose an information program will be conducted before \nproject implementation; an information leaflet has already been prepared. \n\n                                                 \n1 The full resettlement framework (RF) is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n2 Ministry of Planning and World Food Program. 2002.

The entitlements are as follows: \n \n\nCompensation at replacement cost for houses and other affected structures \nwithout deduction for depreciation or salvageable materials. \nFor agricultural land, compensation in the form of land for land of equal \nproductive capacity, or compensation in cash permitting purchase by APs of land \nof equal quality and productivity to that lost. \nReplacement of premises/residential land with land of equal size acceptable to \nthe AP. \nReplacement of commercial land with land of equal size and commercial \npotential acceptable to the APs. \n\n \n7. \nA  grievance  process  has  been  established.  It  will  allow  APs  who  are  not  satisfied  that \nthe  compensation,  replacement  of  lost  assets,  livelihoods,  and  allowances  due  to  them  have \nbeen fairly provided to seek redress and to make a formal complaint. A provincial resettlement \ngrievance committee will be established and similar committees created at district, commune, \nand  village  levels.  APs  may  be  assisted  by  any  nongovernment  organization  and  by  the  EM, \nand can take court action for this purpose without cost to the AP. \n \n8. \nSeverely affected persons will be eligible for economic rehabilitation assistance including \nassistance in skills training and other allowances such as \u201cdisruption allowance\u201d or \u201ctransfer and \nsubsistence allowance.\u201d \n \n9. \nresettlement. \n \n10. \nwhose land rights are based on land use and occupancy. \n \n11. \nAPs  will  be  fully  compensated  for  all  assets  lost  as  a  result  of  any  subprojects \ninfrastructure, regardless of whether APs have formal title to the land that they occupy and use. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  people  eligible  for  compensation  are  all  those  who  will \nexperience negative impacts on their assets and livelihoods as a result of the Project. \n \n\nThe  RPs  will  allow  the  Government,  ADB,  and  an  EM  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the \n\nNo  distinction  will  be  made  between  APs  with  land  title,  and  those  without  title  and \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n12. \nThe institutional framework for preparing and implementing RPs at the national level is \nthat of an interministerial resettlement committee (IRC), which is a committee of the Council of \nMinisters  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF).  An  undersecretary  of \nstate of MEF is the chairman of the IRC, with members from the Ministry of Water Resources \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nand Meteorology (MOWRAM), other implementing ministries, the municipality of Phnom Penh, \nand governors of the provinces involved in the concerned project. \n \n13. \nA  resettlement  unit  (RU)  in  MOWRAM  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  surveys  and \nconsultations and for preparing RPs. For this purpose, the RU combines forces with provincial \ndepartments  in  the  concerned  province,  headed  by  the  Provincial  Department  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (PDWRAM),  as  a  provincial  resettlement  working  group \nresponsible to a provincial resettlement subcommittee. \n \n14. \nThe  RU  will  conduct  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  report  at  three  monthly \nintervals  to  the  IRC  and  to  ADB.  An  EM  appointed  by  MEF  will  work  under  the  supervision  of \nMOWRAM\u2019s RU to monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the RPs and \nto assist APs in any grievance or dispute over resettlement and compensation. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nmeans of mitigating them are identified in Table A6. \n\nThe main risks associated with resettlement in the Project and its subprojects and the \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable A6: Main Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMain Risk \n\nMitigating Measure \n\nPoor identification at the planning stage \nof impact of canal and reservoir \nconstruction on land, people, and \nproperty  \n\nClose working  relationship  of  the  MOWRAM  RU \nfor \nwith  engineering  divisions  and  provision \nto  be \ntopographical  survey  and  alignments \ncoordinated with DMS early in project design \n\nPoor or poorly timed information to APs \nand others \n\nLoss of livelihoods because of severe \nland loss in conditions of poverty and \nland shortage \n\nIneffective monitoring of RP \nimplementation \n\nStrengthened information dissemination, including \ninformation booklets and newsletters, conducted \nby RU and provincial resettlement subcommittee \n\nLand for replacement or compensation at least at \nmarket  levels  and  other  measures,  including \ntraining, help in job seeking and credit, to restore \nand improve sustainable incomes \n\nStrengthened  terms  of  reference  for  the  EM, \nappointed  at  the  start  of  the  Project  for  the \nduration of the project for all subprojects \n\nIneffective administration of the \ngrievance and grievance resolution \nprocedures \n\nSupport for APs at every stage by the EM trained \nto conduct assessment and valuation in grievance \nresolution and arbitration \n\nAP = affected person, DMS = detailed measurement survey, EM = external monitor, MOWRAM = Ministry of Water \nResources and Meteorology, RP = resettlement plan, RU = resettlement unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN FOR THE PONLEY RESERVOIR SUBPROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nSummary \n\nThe  Ponley  Reservoir  is  one  of  the  core  subprojects  selected  for  funding  under  the \n\n1. \nProject and studied to feasibility level during the project preparation phase. \n\n2. \nThe subproject impact on affected persons (APs) will be due mainly to the acquisition of \nland for a corridor of impact (COI) of the canal works, on average 14 meters (m) wide, and the \nincrease in area of the reservoir. Approximately 1,062 people in 189 households will be affected \nby  land  acquisition  for  the  Project.  No  houses  are  affected.  A  total  of  91  hectares  (ha)  of \nagricultural  land  will  be  acquired  in  the  canal  COI  and  in  the  enlarged  reservoir,  requiring \nreplacement  or  compensation.  Some  land  in  the  reservoir  will  become  usable  for  recession \ncropping. \n\n3. \n\nThe total cost of implementing the resettlement plan (RP) is estimated to be $63,600. \n\nFull  RPs  for  the  Ponley  Reservoir  subproject  and  the  other  core  subprojects  studied \n\n4. \nduring project preparation are presented in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\nB. \n\nThe Project \n\nThe Ponley Reservoir is located about 50 kilometers (km) northeast of Sisophon town in \n\n5. \nan isolated and backward part of Banteay Meanchey Province close to the Thai border and \nsome 20 km north of National Highway No. 6. The subproject will entail raising the level and \ncapacity of the reservoir and reconstructing sluice gates, which will directly supply water to 675 \nha of irrigated land, and for that purpose constructing two branch canals and farmer field \nsystems. The embankment road will be restored and 8 km of laterite road resurfaced to improve \nall-season access. The embankment will be extended to provide flood protection to Ponley \nCheung village, and a drinking water supply system to Ponley Cheung and another village. \n\nC. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile \n\nThe Ponley reservoir subproject area and its environs are frontier country. A high \n\n6. \nproportion of the population are comparatively recent settlers, and scrub forest is still being \ncleared and turned into rice paddies. Ponley Cheung, the main village in the area, has a rough \nand ready atmosphere to it, with houses built of weathered wood and salvaged forest material \nrather than more permanent materials. Virtually all economic activities within the subproject area \nare agriculture based. \n\nSocioeconomic data were gathered from three sources: (i) the 1998 National Census \n\n7. \nand Socioeconomic Survey; (ii) a sociological and agricultural survey of the subproject area \nconducted for the feasibility study, and (iii) a baseline socioeconomic survey of all APs. \n\n8. \nPhnom Srok district, which includes Ponley, has the highest proportion of poor \nhouseholds, 52%, in the province of Banteay Meanchey.1 Investigations during the subproject \nfeasibility study indicated that, in the four villages surveyed in Ponley commune, the proportion \nof poor and very poor ranged from 35% in Svay Sa to 70% in Ponley Cheung itself. About 60% \nof all households are ranked by the village development committees as being either poor or very \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Planning and World Food Program. 2002.

Around 30% of households face food deficit over 6 months per year, although \nthe villages of Svay Khmau (35% of households) and Svay Sa (73% of households) have a food \ndeficit for more than 6 months of the year. \n \nD. \n \n\nResettlement \n\n1. \n\nObjectives and Principles \n\n \nThe objectives of resettlement are to minimize the impact of project works on APs and to \n9. \nensure  that  their  assets  and  livelihoods  are  restored  to  at  least  their  level  before  the  Project. \nResettlement will follow the principles and procedures described in the resettlement framework \n(RF)  that  was  prepared  following  the  draft  national  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995)  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice (1998) and \nagreed  upon  with  the  Government.  A  summary  RF  is  in  Appendix  6  and  the  full  RF  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n \n10. \nAt the national level, the institutional framework for preparing and implementing the RP \nis, that of an interministerial resettlement committee (IRC), which is a committee of the Council \nof Ministers administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). An undersecretary of \nstate  of  MEF  is  chairman  of  the  IRC.  A  resettlement  unit  (RU)  in  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM) \nfor  conducting  surveys  and \nconsultations  and  for  preparing  the  RP.  For  this  purpose,  the  RU  will  combine  forces  with \nprovincial  departments  in  the  province  concerned,  headed  by  the  Provincial  Department  of \nWater  Resources  and  Meteorology  (PDWRAM),  as  a  provincial  resettlement  working  group \nresponsible to a provincial resettlement subcommittee. \n \nThe  RU  will  conduct  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  report  at  three  monthly \n11. \nintervals to the IRC and to ADB. An external monitor (EM) appointed by MEF will work under the \nsupervision of MOWRAM\u2019s RU to monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of \nthe RP and to assist APs in any grievance or dispute over resettlement and compensation. \n \n\nis  responsible \n\nValuation and Compensation \n\n3. \n \n12. \nLand  values  were  provisionally  determined  through  a  survey  of  current  market  values \nand  through  calculation  of  replacement  costs.  MEF  will  liaise  with  the  provincial  resettlement \nsubcommittee  and  MOWRAM  to  consult  with  APs  and  determine  compensation  or  land \nreplacement.  The  EM  will  be  a  qualified  valuer  to  assist  in  determining  land  values  in  any \ndisagreement over values and measurements. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n4. \n \nThe main risks associated with resettlement in the Ponley subproject and the means of \n\n13. \nmitigating them are identified in Table A7. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nTable A7: Risks and Mitigating Measures in the Ponley Subproject \n\nMain Risk \n\nPoor identification at the planning stage of the \nimpact of canal and reservoir construction on \nland, people, and property  \n\nMitigating Measure \n\nConsultation  of  MOWRAM\u2019s  RU  with  engineering \ndivisions  and  provision  for  topographical  survey \nand alignments to be coordinated with DMS early \nin project design \n\nPoor or poorly timed information to APs and \nothers \n\nStrengthened information dissemination, \nincluding information booklet and newsletters \n\nLoss of livelihoods because of severe land loss in \nconditions of poverty and land shortage \n\nIneffective monitoring of RP implementation \n\nIneffective administration of the grievance and \ngrievance resolution procedures \n\nLand replacement or compensation at least at \nmarket levels and other measures, including \ntraining, help in job seeking and credit, to restore \nand improve sustainable incomes \n\nStringent terms of reference for the EM appointed \nat the start of  the pojrect for the duration of the \nproject for all subprojects \n\nSupport for APs at every stage by the EM trained \nto provide assessment and valuation in grievance \nresolution and arbitration \n\nAP = affected person, DMS = detailed measurement survey, EM = external monitor, MOWRAM = Ministry of  \nWater Resources and Meteorology, RU = resettlement unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n5. \n\nProject Resettlement Costs \n\n14. \nCompensation  costs  are  provisionally  calculated  on  the  basis  of  replacement  or \ncompensation for agricultural land along the canal and in the reservoir. It is expected that land \nreplacement  in  the  irrigation  area  will  be  conducted  as  part  of  a  process  of  farmer-to-farmer \nexchange  and  taking  into  account  increased  irrigated  cropping  areas  and  cropping  intensities. \nThe  total  cost  of  implementing  the  RP  is  estimated  as  $63,600  and  will  come  from  the \nGovernment  as  counterpart  financing.  This  cost  includes  $13,700  for  administration,  of  which \n$6,000 is the cost for this specific subproject of the independent EM who will be contracted to \nmonitor and evaluate all resettlement activities of the overall Project. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A8.1: Expenditure Accounts Cost Summary\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\nCurrency Exchange\n($'000)\n\n($'000)\n\nTotal\nCost\n($'000)\n\n%\n\n% Total\n\nForeign Base\nExchange Costs\n\n40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nItem\n\n A.

The  purpose  will  be  achieved  through  the  rehabilitation  of  small  to  medium-scale \nirrigation schemes servicing a potential command area of 35,000 hectares (ha)\u201419,000 ha for \nflood spreading and/or recession cropping, 16,000 ha for wet season irrigated cropping, 5,000 \nha  for  dry  season  irrigated  cropping\u2014directly  affecting  some  24,000  families  or  an  estimated \n120,000 beneficiaries. As a result of (i) improved water management during the wet season, (ii) \nuse of seasonal surpluses for flood spreading and/or recession practices for better management \nof  localized  flooding,  and  (iii)  greater  retention  of  surface  runoff  in  the  upper  reaches  of \ncatchments  (without  having  detrimental  impacts  on  downstream  users),  coupled  with  adoption \nof improved production technologies, the Project will improve food security in rice-deficit areas \nof  the  northwest.  Improved  water  security  will  also  raise  household  incomes  where  market \naccess exists by permitting diversification into high\u2013value/high\u2013yielding rice and crops of higher \nvalue.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  prepared  for  three  representative  core \nsubprojects, two typifying rice-insecure situations and the other, Po Pi Deum, where the better \nurban market access justifies the production of perishable, higher-value goods. \n \n2. \nThe analysis attempts to quantify measurable benefits based on incremental production \nof rice (primarily), the traditional crop in the area with some diversification represented by mung \nbeans  and  cucurbits.  Other  nonquantifiable  benefits  are  expected  depending  on  the  nature  of \nthe  subproject.  Flood  management  can  give  protection  to  households;  embankments  that \ndouble as rural roads can allow better access to adjacent producing areas as well as improved \naccess to social services (health and education, etc.); improved nutritional status of households \nin areas where food deficits are common, and improved access to domestic water sources that \nsurvive the dry season are all likely to be realized under the Project. Benefits from institutional \nstrengthening initiatives are considered significant because government agencies will be able to \nbetter  plan  and  monitor  development  in  the  water  sector.  As  this  is  a  sector  project,  the \neconomic  analysis  presented  here  and  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I  will  be  a  model  for \nassessing and selecting potential irrigation schemes to rehabilitate to achieve both food security \nand income generation through diversification. \n \nG. \n\nMethodology \n\n3. \nFinancial prices used in the analysis were identified through a survey of the subproject \narea  and  cross-checked  with  prices  identified  in  other  projects  and  other  secondary  sources. \nEconomic prices were derived based on the following: (i) a world price numeraire was used;1 (ii) \nvalues are expressed in constant 2002 prices to exclude inflation; (iii) the US dollar is the unit of \naccount\u2014even  in  rural  areas  of  Cambodia,  the  dollar  and  Thai  baht  are  commonly  accepted \ncurrencies and the riel is used for smaller purchases; (iv) for nontraded goods and services, a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 were used; (v) in the \ncase of major tradable commodities, economic values were based on border parity pricing with \nstandard methods for deriving farmgate input/output prices; and (vi) transfer payments such as \ntaxes and subsidies were excluded in calculating economic values. \n                                                 \n1    A  domestic  price  numeraire  would  be  equally  appropriate  in  the  northwest  of  Cambodia  as  many  of  the  local \nvillages still suffer extended food shortages for up to 6 months a year where incremental production is likely to be \nconsumed in the local or neighboring villages. Only in the more accessible areas close to Route 5 will incremental \nproduction be marketed outside the area of production, for which ample markets, both local and export, exist. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nIn  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  of  core  subprojects  (Link  Canal, Po Pi Deum, \n4. \nand Ponley irrigation rehabilitation), cropping patterns and technologies in the with- and without- \nproject  scenarios  are  detailed,  based  on  the  expected  changes  in  land  use  due  to  improved \nwater  management  and/or  increased  availability  of  water  for  dry  season  cropping.  The  with- \nproject  cropping  patterns  and  intensities  used  are  similar  to  the  changes  experienced  in \nKompong  Puoy  (Battambang)  and  Western  Baray  irrigation  rehabilitation  (Siem  Reap),  and \nPRASAC  (Pursat)  financed  by  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization,  International  Labour \nOrganization, and the European Union, respectively. Per hectare production costs and returns \nfor  rice  using  traditional  production  methods\u2014broadcast  and  transplanting  techniques\u2014were \ncompared  with  irrigated  production  using  increased  inputs  in  financial  and  economic  terms. \nBased  on  a  net  benefit  area  that  can  be  irrigated  from  due  to  project  intervention,  the \nincremental  value  of  production  in  each  core  subproject  was  calculated  and  compared  with \nrehabilitation costs. \n \n5. \nThe construction cost of each subproject was estimated in financial and economic terms \nbased on designs of proposed structures and earthworks. Operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts  were  estimated  at  $50/ha  per  annum  for  routine  maintenance  comprising  farmers\u2019 \ncontribution ($30/ha) for secondary and tertiary canals and government contribution ($20/ha) for \nheadworks  and  primary  canals.  In  addition,  allowance  was  made  for  a  major  repair  of  the \ninfrastructure every 7 years after construction (periodic maintenance), generally assumed to be \nequivalent  to  30%  of  the  original  earthworks  and  10%  of  the  original  structure  cost  of  the \nincremental investment.2 Both benefits and costs were expressed as cash flow streams over an \nexpected 25 years to generate net present values, together with financial and economic rates of \nreturn.  Finally,  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  the  outcomes  by  assuming  scenarios \nrelating to risk factors such as shortened project life due to poor O&M, increased construction \ncosts , decreased benefits, and a drop in the price of rice. An assessment of the Project's impact \non returns to labor also gives an indication of its potential impact on poverty reduction. \n \nData  for  one  of  the  three  core  subprojects  analyzed  are  given  in  paras.  7\u201316  and \n6. \nsummarized in Tables A13.1 and A13.2. Comparative details for the remaining core subprojects \nare presented in tabular form in Table A13.3. \n \nC. \n\nPo Pi Deum Irrigation Rehabilitation \n\n7. \nThe Po Pi Deum subproject will rehabilitate one barrage across the Mongkol Borei River \nwith  an  associated  intake  plus  delivery  and  drainage  canals  to  improve  wet  season  irrigation \nand drainage on 1,400 ha while providing 350 ha of incremental dry season irrigation in a self- \ncontained area that forms part of a larger irrigation system. \n \n\n1. \n\nSubproject Benefits \n\n8. \nIncremental  crop  production,  net  of  additional  production  costs,  forms  the  basis  of \nquantifiable  benefits  for  this  subproject.  The  without-project  scenario  assumes  1,400  ha  of \ntraditional broadcast rain-fed rice during the wet season yielding 2 tons (t)/ha. The with-project \noutput is expected to reach 3.6 t/ha (a conservative estimate) phased in over 4 years due to a \ndecrease in flood damage, better drainage, and the availability of water to finish the wet season \nrice  plus  the  introduction  of  shorter-duration,  higher-yielding  aromatic  varieties,  increased \ninputs,  and  land  leveling.  After  rehabilitation,  there  will  be  sufficient  water  for  150  ha  of  dry \nseason short-duration improved aromatic rice varieties, 100 ha of cucurbits, and 50 ha of mung \n\n                                                 \n2  No allowance was made for emergency maintenance because this cost is unpredictable. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nbeans  (representing  diversified  production),  increasing  the  cropping  intensity  to  125%. \nRehabilitation of Po Pi Deum irrigation is expected to increase production of rice by 2,900 t and \ndiversified  crops  by  900  t,  and  provide  incremental  on-farm employment of 104,800 days per \nyear  due  to  the  additional  labor  inputs  required  in  production.  Financial  net  crop  revenue  will \nincrease by $165,000 and economic net crop revenue by $214,000. These figures equate to an \naverage incremental income of $118 per annum per cropped hectare (236% increase). For the \naverage farm of 1.3 ha, the average household income will increase by $275 per annum, which \nis  more  than  adequate  to  meet  the  irrigation  service  fees  levied  by  the  water  user  groups to \nmaintain the secondary and tertiary canal networks. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Costs \n\nSubproject  costs  cover  detailed  design  and  supervision,  construction,  O&M  for \n9. \nsecondary and tertiary canals ($30/ha3 contributed by beneficiaries) plus headworks and main \ncanals  ($20/ha4  by  the  provincial  government),  water  user  group  establishment  and  support, \nagricultural extension programs, and resettlement (land component omitted in economic costs). \nThe  total  financial  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $635,897.  Annual  O&M  costs  amount  to \n$42,000  plus  $28,000 \nto  meet  routine \nmaintenance  while  the  government  will  incur  a  further  cost  of  $120,776  every  7  years  for \nperiodic  maintenance.  This  latter  amount  will  be  accumulated  progressively  through  annual \nbudgetary allocations ($11,500) to a provincial maintenance account as piloted in the Northwest \nRural  Development  Project.5  Monitoring  and  benefit  evaluation  studies  to  be  performed  after \ncompletion  of  the  subproject  and  agricultural  development  initiatives  were  included  in  the \nassessment. \n \n\nfor  beneficiary  and  government,  respectively, \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n10. \nFarmer  Incentives.  An  estimated  1,076  households  have  land  in  the  Po  Pi  Deum \ncommand area.6 For the average 1.3 ha farm, incremental rice production will be 2.67 t/ha per \nyear  when  the  subproject  is  fully  operational.  That  yield  is  equal  to  the  basic  nutritional \nrequirement  for  a  six-member  household  without  any  preference  for  consumption  above  this \nlevel.  Annual  farm  income  will  increase  by  an  average  of  $373.7  Of  this  amount, $275 is from \nincremental net crop income and the balance from increased farm employment.  That amount \nwill give adequate incentive to participate in the Project. \n \n11. \nCapacity and Willingness to Pay for O&M.  Annual O&M costs associated with the Po \nPi  Deum  investment  were  estimated  at  $50/ha,  of  which  the  farmer  is  expected  to  contribute \n$30/irrigated ha ($39 per household). Incremental net crop benefits (alone) per household are a \nmultiple of seven times this requirement, suggesting that beneficiaries have adequate capacity \n\n                                                 \n3    ADB. 1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Capacity  Building  in  MOWRAM.   Manila. \nEstimates  of  O&M  requirements  are  $30-$50/ha  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  irrigation  scheme,  i.e.,  the \npresence of significant headworks and/or main canals. \n\n4  Includes an allowance for maintaining the total investment, not just incremental rehabilitation. \n5    ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n\n6  The number of households benefiting from the subproject\u2019s  benefited area was calculated by dividing the benefited \n\narea by the average cultivated irrigable landholding per household in the surrounding villages. \n\n7  Including both incremental net crop income (in which all labor inputs were counted as a cost of production) as well \nas incremental returns to family labor. For that part of the incremental labor that is drawn from the farm household \nitself, these \u201cwages\u201d comprise part of household income (in addition to net crop revenue) although the additional \ntime commitment to on-farm work may partly have an opportunity cost of work and income off the farm. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nand incentive to protect their benefits by contributing to O&M costs.8 Their willingness to pay will \nbe  reinforced  by  the  activities  of  irrigation  extension  teams  through  training.  It  is  also  relevant \nthat some beneficiaries under this subproject are the pilot farmer water user community (FWUC) \nbeneficiaries under reallocated counterpart funds from the ADB-financed agriculture sector loan9 \nto promote irrigation management and transfer for the sustained operations of the subproject. \n \n12. \nImplications for FWUCs.  Annual contributions to O&M from the rehabilitated area are \nestimated at $42,000 that can be paid in cash or in kind, (labor). Assuming a cash contribution \nof $20/ha, the balance of farmer obligation for O&M amounts to about 1day a month. \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  Po  Pi  Deum  subproject,  assessed  over  the  25-year  life  of  the  investment,  is \n13. \nexpected  to  be  financially  viable  for  the  beneficiary  farmers  and  economically  viable  for  the \ncountry. The economic net present value of the net benefit stream is $250,358 (Table A13.2), \nassuming  a  12%  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is \n17.8%  and  the  benefit-cost  ratio  is  1.3:1.  Sensitivity  analysis  focused  on  the  perceived  risks \nconfronting the Project: (i) increasing construction costs; (ii) the effective life of the investment, if \nO&M is not adequately performed and project life is subsequently reduced; (iii) the price of rice, \nas  farmgate  price  fluctuations  are  considered  sensitive  to  incremental  supplies  (although  this \nappears to be a seasonal characteristic rather than a reflection of the saturation of the market \nthroughout the year); (iv) total benefits; and (v) the actual command area achieved. \n \n14. \nInvestment  Cost.  While  care  was  taken  to  accurately  estimate  the  cost  of  the \nsubproject  investment  (that  has  been  revised  upward  since  the  feasibility  design  study),  it  is \npossible that actual costs may be higher than the estimate. A 20% increase in investment costs \nwill cause the EIRR to fall to 15.4%. The sensitivity factor is 0.7 and the switching value occurs \nat a 59% increase in investment cost. \n \n15. \nProject Life.  Project sustainability is of concern in that rural infrastructure projects often \nsuffer  from  poor  quality  of  construction  and/or  inadequate  maintenance,  the  latter  being  a \nfunction  of  both  local  perceptions  and  limited  budgetary  allocations.  It  was  assumed  that,  with \nproper O&M, the Po Pi Deum subproject will last for 25 years. If the project life actually turns out \nto  be  only  15  years  because  the  budgetary  allocation  is  not  made  for  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance, the EIRR will decrease to 17.4%. The switching value of project life (shorter than \nwhich the Project will have an EIRR below 12%) is 15 years less than that assumed in the base \ncase. \n \n16. \nPrice  of  Rice.  Rice  is  the  primary  irrigated  crop  in  the  subproject  area  and  forms  a \nsignificant portion of project benefits. If the rice price were to decrease (relative to other prices in \nthe economy) by 20%, the EIRR will decrease to 10.7%. The switching value occurs at a 16% \ndecrease in the farmgate price. The sensitivity (a measure of volatility) of the price effect on the \nEIRR  is  2,  indicating  some  volatility.10  Once  immediate  dietary  requirements  have  been \nsatisfied, it is likely that farmers will diversify to higher-value crops such as beans or cucurbits or \n\n                                                 \n8    Under  the  Agence  Francaise  de  D\u00e9veloppement-assisted  Preah  Nup  Polder  Project,  water  service  fee  recovery \n\ncurrently stands at 68%. \n\n9    ADB. 1996.  Report and Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Cambodia for the Agriculture Sector Program . Manila. \n\n10 Sensitivity is the absolute value of the percent change in the EIRR divided by the percent change in the risk  factor.  \nA  sensitivity  level  for  the  price  of  rice  that  is  greater  than  1  indicates  that  a  percent  change  in  the  rice  price  will \nchange the EIRR by more than 1% of its base case value, indicating a relatively high degree of volatility. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nother  vegetable  crops,  as  good  access  to  the  Sisophon  urban  market  exists  via  the  recently \nupgraded Route 5. \n \n17.   Benefits.  The  economic  calculations  were  based  on  realistic  assumptions  about  the \nlevel  of  project  benefits  through  increased  yields,  etc.  If  some  of  those  benefits  do  not \nmaterialize, the economic returns of the subproject will be reduced. A sensitivity test regarding a \n20%  decrease  in  the  level  of  general  incremental  benefits  indicates  that  the  EIRR  will  fall  to \n12.6%.  The  switching  value  is  at  a  22%  decrease  in  benefits,  while  the  sensitivity  of  this  risk \nfactor is 1.5, indicating a low degree of volatility. \n \n18. \nSubproject  Command  Area.  If  the  ultimate  command  area  is  less than anticipated at \nfeasibility, the economic returns will decrease. A 20% decrease in command area will cause the \nEIRR  to  decrease  to  13.8%.  The  switching  value  is  at  a  28%  decrease  in  area  and  the \nsensitivity factor is 1.1, indicating that returns are relatively robust to this variation. \n \n19. \nOverall, the Po Pi Deum subproject is expected to have financial and economic returns \nthat are moderately robust. The price of rice is the most significant risk factor that can have an \nimpact on the subproject\u2019s ec onomic viability (Table A13.2). With the adoption of secured water \nsupplies, farmers will be able to change their traditional production practices to grow the higher-\npriced  and  higher-yielding  aromatic  varieties \nfor  which  good  market  prospects  exist \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A).  Average  incremental  rice  production  per  household  in  Po  Pi \nDeum  was  estimated  at  2.1  t  for  poor  households  and  4.2  t  for  nonpoor  household.  For  poor \nhouseholds of 5.3 people, the figure represents 400 kg of paddy per person per year,  which is \nlower than the consumption levels observed in poor households in the project area. Incremental \nproduction will be consumed locally as desired consumption levels are higher than the minimal \nnutritional requirement, or will be sold outside the region to Phnom Penh or traded across the \nporous  border  depending  on  seasonal  conditions.  Marketing  inefficiencies  caused  by \ninadequate  road  access  are  not  an  issue  in  Po  Pi  Deum,  as  good  roads  exist  with  many \nmarketing  options.  In  more  remote  areas  of  the  Project,  market  access  is  being  addressed \nthrough  road  development  initiatives  (footnote  5),11  further  reducing  the  risk  from  price \nreductions.  Diversified  cropping  activities  will  give  even  higher  returns  in  this  area  with  the \nintroduction of higher valued crops such as vegetables, cucurbits, and beans. \n \n\n5. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits \n\n20. \nVarious  noncrop  benefits  due  to  the  subproject,  are  not  included  in  the  calculation  of \neconomic  returns.  For  example,  the  rise  in  local  household  income  and  food  production  will \nresult in improved nutrition and welfare for the population. Secondary employment and business \nopportunities  are  expected  to  increase  due  to  the  rise  in  agricultural  production.  The \nrehabilitation of the barrage will also have the added benefit of enabling further rehabilitation in \nother  areas  of  the  larger  irrigation  scheme.  Improved  water  management  is  a  prerequisite  for \nthe  future  development  of  this  scheme  and  the  incremental  cost  for  that  development  is \nsignificantly  less  once  the  barrage  is  rehabilitated.  These  benefits  were  not  included  in  the \noverall assessment of the Po Pi Deum subproject. \n\n                                                 \n11  In  addition,  the  European Union-funded  Economic  and  Social  Relaunch  of  the  Northern  Provinces,  planned  for \n\n2004, will cover all project provinces except Pursat and will focus on developing market access. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\nTable A13.1: Po Pi Deum: Agricultural Production and Revenue in Economic Terms \n\n( 2010 prices in constant 2002 dollars)\n\nScheme Without the Project\n\nArea\n(ha)\n\nYield\n(t/ha)\n\nPhysical\nProduction\n(t)\n\nEconomic\nPrice\n($/t)\n\nGross\n\nEconomic\nEconomic Production\nRevenue\n($)\n\nCost/ha\n($/ha)\n\nGross\nEconomic\nCost\n($)\n\nEconomic\nNet Crop\nIncome\n($)\n\nCrops\n\nImp.

While agricultural production benefits are likely to accrue almost entirely to landowners, \nit is estimated that the poor have 277 ha, or 19.8% of the command area and can be expected \nto  get  a  similar  proportion  of  incremental  net  crop  income.  Overall,  when  combining  crop \nproduction and labor income, the poor may receive 41.1% of the full local financial benefits of \nthe subproject. While the distribution among poor households is likely to be uneven, the average \nannual  incremental  increase  in  household  income  among  the  poor  is  expected  to  be  $315  in \nfinancial terms, and the average incremental increase in rice production on farms of the poor to \nbe  2,11  t.

Nearly 70% of rural households (HHs) depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A strong link exists between \nthe incidence of poverty and agricultural productivity among the large numbers of small-scale subsistence producers \nwhere food deficits of greater than 6 months each year are common. Food insecurity is an important indicator of \npoverty and communities themselves classify food-insecure HHs as poor. Water resources are a key factor in \npromoting agricultural productivity to improve food security, income generation, job creation, and the general quality \nof life in rural areas. Through the development of the water resources sector, the Project will improve the agriculture \nsector, which contributes 39% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and employs 70% of the labor force. \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Classification:   \n\nPoverty Intervention \n\nWith political stability returning to the northwest as late as 1998, the region has been left out of many development \ninitiatives (largely aid-funded) until the past decade. In terms of overall poverty incidence, Siem Reap Province ranks \nsecond  among  the  24  provinces  while  Banteay  Meanchey  and  Pursat  rank  7th  and  8th,  respectively.  Battambang \nProvince\u2019s  ranking  (14th)  is  skewed  by  the  large  urban  population  in  Battambang  township  that  masks  the \nwidespread  poverty  in  the  southern  rural  districts  of  that  province.  Based  on  surveys  in  the  core  subproject  areas \nduring project preparation, 60% of HHs live below the poverty line1 and 60% suffer food deficits as early as 4 months \nafter  the  annual  harvest.  With  increasing  deforestation  in  the  area,  the  option  of  foraging,  hunting,  and  collecting \nforest  products  is  rapidly  declining  so  that  coping  mechanisms  have  become  less  secure.  Health  and  education \nindicators are very poor, with 11,000 people per health center and less than 20% of inhabitants completing primary \neducation. Literacy rates of 46.2% are overstated as it includes those who are only partially literate. Only 1.25% of \nthe rural population have access to safe drinking water  and sanitation. Most rely on hand-dug wells and streams that \nbecome  fouled  during  the  long  dry  season  and  experience  a  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  parasitic \ninfections.  Competition  for  the  better  agricultural  land  has  intensified  with  the  increased political stability and mine \nclearance activities, and the extent of landless HHs is estimated at 20%, even though they may still sharecrop on \nothers\u2019 land. \n\nThe poor HHs are characterized by having smaller plots of land (0.2-0.5 hectare (ha) compared with an average of \n1.3 ha) or no land at all, mostly in rain-fed areas. Where irrigation exists, their plots are usually found on the outer \nextremities  of  schemes  where  the  delivery  of  water  is  unreliable.  Poor  HHs  plant  traditional  varieties  with  minimal \ninputs  of  animal  dung,  achieve  well  below  average  yields  from  their  smallholdings,  and  have  no  access  to  credit. \nThey  live  in  areas  with  limited  access  to  markets  because  of  poor  rural  roads  and  have  limited  employment \nopportunities  other  than  in  neighboring  farmers\u2019  fields.  What  little  land  they  have  tends  to  be  poorly  drained  and \nprone to annual flooding. They live in houses made of natural materials collected from forest areas, in conditions that \nare unhygienic, undermining health and income-earning opportunities. In most cases, physical and social exclusion \ncompound the other, resulting in a perpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic infrastructure and services, poor \nhealth,  poor  living  conditions,  low  productivity,  and  hence  low  incomes.  Some  groups  are  more  prone  to \npoverty- HHs headed by women and HHs with elderly and disabled family members where excessive workloads are \nimposed  on  the  remaining  HH  members  and  traditional  gender-related  activities  such  as  water  collection  are \nreallocated. \n\nProject  Strategies  for  Poverty  Reduction.  While  the  Project  is  constrained  by  the  availability  of  water  in \nundertaking  irrigation  rehabilitation,  the  selection  criteria  adopted  during  project  design  and  during  implementation \nwill  ensure  that  priority  is  accorded  to  schemes  with  the  greatest  potential  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The \ndevelopment  of  irrigation  water  resources  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  reduction  through  increased \nemployment opportunities as well as other social benefits. The Project will enable the poor to participate equitably in \nproject activities and benefit from them. Communities to be included in all subprojects will enter into agreements with \nthe Project to construct through community effort tertiary and quaternary canals, which will improve access to water \nfor landholdings of the marginal farmers located at distances from the canal. Such agreements will be monitored by \nthe  Project  and  will  form  part  of  the  basis  for  the  Project  undertaking  construction  and  rehabilitation  works  for \nirrigation improvements. All water user groups will include representatives of marginal farmer HHs as well as landless \nHHs living and working in the area. The Project will deploy irrigation extension workers (IEWs) who will work with the \nfarmer water  user groups, and will provide training and facilitation services in forming groups and decision making, in \nagriculture  extension,  and  in  diversification  of  income-generating  activities  (off-farm livelihoods activities including \nlivestock  rearing  and  fisheries).  The  IEWs  will  facilitate  the  participation  of  the  poor  HHs,  particularly  the  landless \nHHs,  in  the  water  user  groups  to  improve  their  capacity  to  benefit  from  livelihood  opportunities,  i.e.,  by  improving \ntheir  access  to  water  for  health  and  hygiene,  or  their  access  to  microfinance  for  productive  activities  through \n1 The expenditure required to provide one individual with a calorific intake of 2,100 calories per day \n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ntheir  access  to  water  for  health  and  hygiene,  or  their  access  to  microfinance  for  productive  activities  through \nmembership  in  such  groups.  It  will  also  facilitate  access  to  washing  points  and  drinking  water  supplies  created \nthrough the improved water resources infrastructure. Poverty reduction impacts of the Project will be monitored and \nevaluated  through  participatory  approaches.  Beneficiary  groups,  particularly  the  poor  will  be  fully  involved  in \nmonitoring  project  outcomes,  and  their  effectiveness  in  reducing  poverty  and  vulnerability.  The  Project  will also \nmonitor the participation of the poor in the farmer water user groups and in group- based training programs, and the \nextent to which the poor are enabled to access microfinance resources from microfinance institutions. Certainly, the \nempowerment of farmers to assume responsibility for irrigation management and transfer through water user groups \nwill  address  the  special  needs  of  the  disadvantaged  groups  and  will  also  contribute  significantly  to  breaking  the \npoverty cycle. \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nInitial Stakeholder Analysis. During project preparation, a participatory approach was adopted in carrying out the \nsocial  investigations  using  focus  group  discussions  and  participatory  rural  appraisals  within  the  rural  communities \nincluding  women  and  disadvantaged  groups,  and  in  identifying  potential  subprojects  with  a  wider  group  of \nstakeholders  including  provincial  and  district  administrations.  During  processing,  stakeholder  participation  ensured \nthat local government staff were aware of the poverty objectives of the Project and used those criteria in selecting \neligible subprojects to be considered for financing. \n\nProject  Participation  Strategy.  The  strategy  for  participation  during  subproject  implementation  will  begin  at  the \nfeasibility  study  stage  with  beneficiary  information  and  awareness  campaigns,  and  early  identification  of  any \nresettlement requirements. Greater beneficiary participation will be required during the detailed design stage in (i) \ndetermining canal alignments; (ii) initiating the land adjustment and consolidation process that will eventually lead to \nthe development of a landholding registry to be used in the subsequent issue of cadastral titles; and (iii) initiating the \nprocess  of  establishing  farmer  water  user  communities  (FWUCs)  and  subordinate water user groups (WUGs). To \nassist  in  this  participatory  process,  the  Project  will  fund  irrigation  extension  teams  (IETs)  to  be  recruited  through \nsuitably  experienced  mass  organizations  and  comprising  a  social/community  development  specialist,  an  irrigation \nmanagement  specialist  and,  later,  an  agricultural  extension  specialist.  Once  the  scheme  is  rehabilitated,  the \nparticipation  of  beneficiaries  will  continue  with  the  IETs  training  and  strengthening  the  FWUCs  in  view  of  the \nprogressive transfer of irrigation management transfer and scheme ownership. This overall participatory process will \nrequire  extensive  support  from  the  IETs  to  identify  and  assist  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  groups  within  the \nFWUCs  and  WUGs  and  in  training  them  in  gender  awareness,  group  management,  etc.  The  sustainability  of  the \nproject intervention will depend on the successful participation of the beneficiaries. \n\n \nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nProject Gender Strategies.  Gender is closely linked with poverty in Cambodia. Rural women in general lack access \nto agricultural training and extension. They are also disadvantaged by the lack of clean drinking water supplies, and \nclean  water  for  personal  hygiene.  Women  bear  the  responsibility  for  domestic  work  and  health  care  for  sick  family \nmembers. Their participation in community decision making is low. The lack of gender sensitivity among providers of \nagricultural training and extension further exacerbates the problem. Although women provide a significant amount of \nlabor in agriculture, they are hardly targeted in official training and extension programs, have limited representation in \nlocal committees and, consequently, lower access to information. HHs headed by females (about 15% of the HHs in \nthe  studied  core  subproject  areas),  especially  in  the  northwest,  tend  to  be  poorer  on  account  of  high  dependency \nlevels, lack of adequate adult labor (in particular male labor for income generation), heavy work burdens, low levels \nof  education  of  female  household  heads  (5\u201310%  lower  literacy  rates  in  the studied subproject areas), low health \nlevels,  low  level  of  access  to  land,  and  lack  of  capacity  to  undertake  cultivation  on  account  of  lack  of  capital  and \ninputs (although they are often considered as lower credit risks) among other factors.  \nThe  Project  will  adopt  gender  strategies  to  reach  out  to  poor  women  through  improved  access  to  services,  inputs, \ntraining, and capital. Women beneficiaries will be helped to join WUGs and participate in all group activities. Of the \nIEWs  deployed  by  the  Project  at  field  level,  30%  will  be  women  and  will  be  particularly  responsible  for  facilitating \nwomen\u2019s empowerment (decision making) and participation in project activities. All group members will be trained in \ngender  issues  to  create  at  grassroots  level  the  capacity  to  improve  gender  relations  and  facilitate  equitable \nparticipation by the poor in project activities. Women farmers will be particularly targeted in all extension and training \nactivities\u2014including  seed  production,  inputs  supply\u2014and  be  selected  as  key  farmers for demonstration activities. \nThey will also be targeted for specific training in microfinance and livelihoods diversification. Women beneficiaries will \nbe particularly involved in decision making related to the setting up of washing points and drinking water supply to \nbenefit  them  by  reducing  their  drudgery  and  increasing  their  time  for  other  activities.  All  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation  will  be  gender  responsive.  Gender  impacts  will  be  measured  by  changes  in  women\u2019s  access  to  water \nresources,  improved  crop  production,  improvements  in  income,  food  security,  other  livelihood  opportunities, \nparticipation in training, access to decision making in the groups, changes in the gender division of labor, and overall \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nparticipation in training, access to decision making in the groups, changes in the gender division of labor, and overall \nimpacts  on  gender  and  poverty  and  gender  relations  in  the  community.  Monitoring  will  be  participatory  and  the \nresults will be used to further improve implementation. \n \nA gender plan has been prepared and is presented in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\nSocial Issues \n\nSubject \n\nLevel \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nResettlement \n\nSignificant   Sample resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared for core subprojects \n\nOutput \nPrepared \nRF and full \nRPs for the \ncore \nsubprojects\n\nand a resettlement framework (RF) to guide the preparation of an RP for \neach subproject during project implementation. \nThe RP for each subproject will be prepared, implemented, and \nmonitored. Appointed IETs will facilitate community participation in \nselecting the final canal alignments and locating structures that will \nservice the local communities such as roads and canal bridges, aimed \nas minimizing disruption and land acquisition. Steps will be taken to \nensure adequate livelihood restoration for affected people, particularly \ndisadvantaged and vulnerable HHs. \n\nPositive \n\nSignificant  The social analysis identified some 20% poor and disadvantaged HHs \nthat will become project beneficiaries. The financial analysis confirmed \nthat the potential benefits from improved water management will provide \nsufficient incentive to obtain their participation in scheme operation and \nmaintenance. The social support program provided through IETs will \nalso help these groups develop the necessary linkages so as to benefit \nfrom agricultural development initiatives. \nThe Project will have a positive impact through jobs created for \nincreased agricultural production. \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  significant  impact  on  any  indigenous \npeoples. \nThe risk of increased use of pesticides and other agrochemicals in the \nproject area is limited, given the small total command area contemplated \nfor intensive (dry season) cropping. However, pest management training \nwill be contracted to specialized institutions. An Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-funded \nreducing  and  eliminating \npersistent organic pesticides in the Tonle Sap basin is planned for 2003, \nand  improvement  of  the  regulatory  system  to  ensure  quality  of \nagrochemicals  traded  in  the  market  is  addressed  under  the  ongoing \nADB-funded Agriculture Sector Program and will be continued under the \nproposed Agriculture Sector Development Program.  \n\nNot \nsignificant \nNot \nSignificant \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nfor \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nAffordability \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples  \nOther Risks  \n\n \n \n\n \nE.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "riel (KR) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "KR1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.00026 \nKR3,835 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAFD \nAP \nCOI \nDAO \nECOSORN \n", "EIRR \nEM \nEMU \nFWUC \nha  \nHH \nGDP \nICB \nIEE \nIET \nIEW \nIMT \nIRC \nIS \nIWRM \nLCB \nMAFF \nMEF \nMIME \nMLMUPC \n", "MOE \nMOWRAM \nMRD \nNGO \nNPRS \nO&M \nPDAFF \nPDE \nPDLMUPC \n", "PDWRAM \nPIU \nPMO \nPPCC \nPPMS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \naffected person \ncorridor of impact \nDistrict Agriculture Office \nEconomic and Social Relaunch of Northwest Cambodia \nProject  \neconomic internal rate of return \nexternal monitor \nenvironmental management unit \nfarmer water user community \nhectare \nhousehold \ngross domestic product \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nirrigation extension team \nirrigation extension worker \nirrigation management transfer \nInter-ministerial Resettlement Committee \ninternational shopping \nintegrated water resources management \nlocal competitive bidding \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries \n\u2013  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Mines and Energy \n\u2013  Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and \n", "Construction \n", "\u2013  Ministry of Environment \n\u2013  Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n\u2013  Ministry of Rural Development \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nongovernment organization \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy \noperation and maintenance \nProvincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries \nProvincial Department of Environment \nProvincial Department of Land Management, Urban Planning \nand Construction \nProvincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nprovincial project coordination committee \nproject performance management system \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", "PRASAC \n", "PSC \nRF \nRP \nRU \nSEDP-II \nt/a \nWUG \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Rehabilitation and Support Program for Cambodia\u2019s \nAgricultural Sector \nproject steering committee \nresettlement framework \nresettlement plan \nResettlement Unit \nSecond Socio-Economic Development Plan \nton per hectare \nwater user group \n", " \nNOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "(i) \n \n(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
