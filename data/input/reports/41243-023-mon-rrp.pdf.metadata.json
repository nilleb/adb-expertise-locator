The  additional  financing  will  significantly  expand  the  output  of  the  current  project,3 \nestablishing  a  demonstration  multifunction  general  hospital  in  Songinohairkhan  district  of \nUlaanbaatar.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nUnder  the  current  project,  establishment  of  a  demonstration  multifunction  general \n3. \nhospital  was  planned  in  Songinohairkhan,  the  poorest  district  of  Ulaanbaatar,  to  include \nrenovating and expanding the infrastructure, equipping the hospital, and introducing innovative \nmanagement  systems  (original  hospital  output).5 Civil  works  under  this  output  are  planned  to \nstart  in  the  spring  of  2013.  In  May  2011,  the  Parliament  amended  the  health  law,  requiring \ngeneral  hospitals  to  provide  at  least  seven  specialized  medical  services. 6  This  substantial \nincrease in mandated standards for delivery of health services by general hospitals means that \nthe  funding  allocated  to  the  hospital  output  under  the  current  project  is  no  longer  adequate  to \nachieve the stated output. To accommodate the required upgrading, and considering the poor \nstate  of  the  existing  infrastructure,  the  government  concluded  that  it  was  more  efficient  to \nconstruct  a  new  hospital  in  the  same  location  than  to  continue  with  the  original  plan  of \nrenovating and rehabilitating the old hospital complex. The government has therefore requested \nadditional financing to support the proposed project expansion. The government aims to use the \nnew  demonstration  general  hospital  as  a  model  to  be  replicated  in  the  nine  districts  of \nUlaanbaatar. 7  This  300-bed  hospital 8  will  include  modern  features  such  as  surgical  and \nmaternity services; adequate diagnostic and laboratory capacity; integrated management of out- \nand  inpatient  departments;  model  nursing  care;  proper  medical  waste management;  adequate \n\n                                                 \n1  Consulting  services  for  additional  financing  were  provided  through  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-\nfinanced  projects  in  the  health  sector  in  agreement  with  the  executing  agency.  (ADB.  2007.  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  Mongolia  for  the  Third  Health \nSector  Development  Project.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia for the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. \nManila [Grant 0236-MON]). \n\n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia \n\nfor the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. Manila (Grant 0236-MON). \n\n3   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4   In the text, \u201coverall project\u201d refers to the current project and proposed additional financing. \n5  The  demonstration  hospital  will  disproportionally  serve  the  poorest  residents  of  Ulaanbaatar;  Songinohairkhan \n\ndistrict is a typical destination for internal migrants displaced by natural disasters. \n\n6  2011  Amended  Health  Law,  Article  16.12:  General  hospitals  shall  provide  the  population  with  health  care  and \nservices in no less than seven areas (internal, pediatrics, obstetrics, general surgery, dental care, neurology, and \ninfectious  diseases)  through  the  forms  of  ambulatory-based  and  inpatient  treatment  and  care.  It  may  have  a \ndecentralized outpatient facility based on location and health needs of the population. \n\n7  Under the new hospital policy developed under the current project, there are plans to establish 11 general hospitals \n\nto cover the population of Ulaanbaatar by 2020. \n\n8  The exact number of beds will be determined at the hospital design stage. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ninfection  prevention  and  control  measures;  and  advanced  information  technology  tools  for \npatient, procurement, and financial management.9  \n \n4. \nHospital  infrastructure  in  Mongolia  is  generally  poor.  Moreover,  the  rapid  population \ngrowth  in  Ulaanbaatar  requires  continuous  investments  in  hospitals.  The  expanded  output \ntargeted at construction of the demonstration multifunction general hospital is an integral part of \nthe broader effort to reform hospitals being supported under the current project. As part of the \ncurrent project, a hospital policy and a strategic hospital development plan to restructure public \nand private hospitals are expected to be approved by the cabinet in 2012. The broader financial \nimplications and funding requirements of a modern public hospital network are analyzed and are \npart  of  the  impending  strategic  plan.  A  detailed  operational  plan  including  financial,  human \nresources, and managerial aspects, is being developed for the demonstration hospital, with the \nassistance of the World Health Organization (WHO). The operational costs of providing higher-\nquality care through the demonstration hospital are projected to increase from the current level. \nActual costs will depend on factors such as the staff\u2013bed ratio, higher wages to motivate staff, \nand  proper  budgeting  for  maintenance  services  and  capital  depreciation.10 Recent  and  future \ntrends  in  Mongolia\u2019s  public  finance  suggest  that  additional  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \ncosts for the demonstration hospital can be comfortably financed by rising public revenues. \n \n5. \nTotal  out-of-pocket  health  expenditures  are  estimated  at  17%\u201330%  of  total  health \nexpenditures  in  Mongolia,  which  is  in  line  with  the  WHO\u2019s  guideline  of  not  exceeding  30%. \nAbout  80%  of  the  population  is  covered  by  health  insurance  and  about  50%  of  hospital \nrevenues are paid for by direct state funding. This contributes to accessibility and affordability. \nNevertheless, equity in accessing health care for the poorer segments of the population remains \na  challenge,  as  some  of  these  individuals  do  not  have  health  insurance.  In  addition,  out-of-\npocket  payments  are  the  rule  for  those  who  are  insured.  ADB  is  addressing  equity  issues \nthrough three ongoing projects11 and the reform of the citizens\u2019 health insurance law promoted \nby the Social Sectors Support Program.12  \n \n6. \nperforming well: \n(i) \n\nThe  current  project  was  assessed  on  the  following  indicators  and  is  considered  to  be \n\nImplementation results against expected project outputs. The current project \nhas  established  a  solid  foundation  to  achieve  all  outputs  in  the  three  key  focus \nareas. The time estimated for completion of the original outputs has not yet been \nreached. Nonetheless, the hospital policy was submitted to and discussed in the \nhigh-level strategic hospital planning committee under the deputy prime minister, \nand is expected to be submitted to the cabinet within 2012. The strategic hospital \n\n                                                 \n9  Current  general  hospitals  in  districts  of  Ulaanbaatar  offer  a  limited  range  of  services,  delink  out-  and  inpatient \n\nservices, and have limited laboratory and information technology capacity. \n\n10 Operational  costs  of  the  current  district  hospital  in  Songinohairkhan  are  estimated  at  10%  of  investment  costs; \ntypically,  capital  depreciation  costs  are  not  included,  while  maintenance,  consumables,  and  pharmaceuticals  are \nunderfunded. \n\n11 ADB.  2007.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  Mongolia  for  the  Social  Sectors  Support  Program.  Manila.  The  program  helped \nensure that the budget for social sector expenditures remained adequate during the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis. It \nalso implemented a set of policy measures in the social welfare, health, and education sectors to provide essential \nsocial  services,  and  to  initiate  longer-term  reforms  to  improve  the  targeting  of  social  assistance  and  health \ninsurance, and living conditions of the poor. In early 2011, the cabinet submitted the draft citizens\u2019 health insurance \nlaw to the Parliament; it is tabled for discussion at the spring session of the Parliament ending in February 2013. \nThe draft law includes improved targeting of government subsidies for health insurance for the poor. \n\n\fdevelopment plan, which will provide operational details on hospital restructuring, \nis also expected to be submitted to the government for approval within 2012. The \nwork on strengthening postgraduate specialist education is still at an initial stage \nand technical assistance is being provided as planned. A revision of the outdated \n2002\u20132011  drug  policy  is  being  undertaken  to  better  define  needed  reforms  of \ndrug  regulatory  functions.  These  steps  will  precede  establishment  of  the  new \ndrug regulatory authority. Human resources for the drug regulatory authority are \nbeing  recruited.  The  General  Agency  for  Specialized  Inspection  (GASI)  is \nmonitoring very closely the timely completion of the central laboratory and plans \nto invite the design qualification expert within 2012 to ensure that the drug control \nlaboratory meets the requirements for international accreditation. \nImplementation  progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory. The current \nproject had achieved 30% of cumulative physical progress against 32% elapsed \ntime  by  September  2012.  Cumulative  contract  awards  and  disbursement  are \nconsistent with projections. \nSafeguard  compliance. Safeguard requirements are being met. The grievance \nredress mechanism under the environmental management plan was established \nfrom  the  start  of  the  current  project  and  no  complaint  has  been  received.  The \nenvironmental  management  plan  was  updated  and  approved  by  ADB.  The  first \nannual  environmental  monitoring  report  was  submitted  to  ADB  in  July  2012. \nGASI  and  the  Central  Laboratory  are  complying  with  the  requirement  for \nhazardous  chemical  waste  management.  The  gender  action  plan  is  being \nimplemented  satisfactorily.  Resettlement  is  not  required  under  the  current \nproject. There are no safeguard issues regarding indigenous peoples. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  Risks  are  being  managed  successfully.  The  report  and \nrecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  for  the  current \nproject identified major risks as (a) resistance to change from key health workers' \ngroups  and  government  agencies,  and  the  community;  and  (b)  lack  of \ngovernment  and  community  support  for  hospital  reform.  No  resistance  has \nemerged, although hospital reforms were discussed in broad fora involving many \nstakeholders,  and  information  campaigns  were  organized.  Agencies  such  as \nGASI,  the  State  Property  Committee,  and  professional  associations  have  been \nkeen  to  actively  participate  in  the  discussion  on  hospital  reform.  Mitigation \nmeasures  proposed  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  of  the \ncurrent project are being implemented and potential risks have not materialized.  \nProject  performance  rating. The current project is rated on track in the project \nperformance rating. \n\n(v) \n\n \n7. \nThe design of the current project was relevant and consistent with previous initiatives to \nreform the Mongolian health sector in line with the National Development Strategy to 2021 and \nthe government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan (2006\u20132015). The current project focuses on three \nkey  areas:  (i)  hospital  services  in  Ulaanbaatar,  (ii)  human  resources  development,  and  (iii)  a \ndrug  safety  regime.  The  current  project,  enhanced  by  the  additional  financing  (the  overall \nproject),  will  improve  governance  in  the  sector  by  improving  public  investment  planning, \nproviding  decent  and  efficient  hospital  services,  protecting  the  population  against  counterfeit \nand  substandard  drugs,  and  facilitating  public  access  to  information  on  hospital  performance \nand drug safety. At the same time, hospital reforms give the government a unique opportunity to \nestablish  public\u2013private  collaboration  for  the  benefit  of  the  population.  The  overall  project  will \ndeliver tangible benefits to women by ensuring their active participation in institutional processes \nto reform hospitals and drug safety. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe  additional  financing  is  considered  to  meet  the  four  eligibility  criteria  for  additional \n8. \nfinancing.13 First, ADB reviewed the current project in April 2012 and confirmed the satisfactory \nperformance  and  that  no  significant  changes  in  approaches  and  methodologies  were \nenvisioned.14 Accordingly, the current project remains technically feasible, economically viable, \nand  financially  sound.  Second,  the  government  accords  high  priority  to  the  current  project  as \nproposed  to  be  expanded  through  the  additional  financing.  The  demonstration  hospital \nrepresents a concrete step in implementing the 2011 amended health law, as acknowledged by \nthe government\u2019s request for additional financing. Third, the project outcome remains the same, \nwhile the output related to the demonstration hospital, supported by the additional financing, will \nbe  enhanced  and  remains  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives.  Fourth,  the \nexpanded project and its outcome are consistent with the current country partnership strategy, \n2012\u20132016, 15  which  emphasizes  social  development  through  efficient  delivery  of  health \nservices.  \n \n9. \nThe additional financing modality is highly relevant as the modification in respect of the \ndemonstration hospital output will make it possible to meet the objectives of the current project \nin light of the amended  health law requiring higher standards for general hospitals. The Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  loan  modality  is  relevant  to  finance  major  infrastructure  rather  than  using \nAsian  Development  Fund  grant  funding  as  in  the  current  project.  The  current  project \nimplementation  arrangements  (i.e.,  project  steering  committee,  implementing  agency,  and \nproject  implementation  unit)  are  effective  and  ensure  a  high  degree  of  readiness  in \nimplementing  the  additional  financing.  The  development  of  the  hospital  policy  and  strategic \nhospital  development  plan  under  the  current  project  and  continuing  under  the  overall  project \nprovides  a  framework  for  later  replication  of  the  demonstration  general  hospital  to  be \nestablished under the additional financing. The enhanced model character of the new hospital \nwill reinforce its demonstration effect and will provide a strong incentive for reforming hospitals \nin Mongolia as promoted under the current project.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  and  outcome  statements  of  the  current  project  will  be  retained.  The \nexpected  impact of  the  overall  project  will be to  improve the health status  of  the  Mongolian \npopulation,  including  the  poor.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  health  sector  efficiency, \ngovernance, and drug safety.  An outcome and an impact indicator will be added to reflect the \nstrengthened hospital sector. The outputs will also be retained, except for the indicators of the \noriginal output 3 related to establishment of the demonstration hospital. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe 12 outputs of the overall project are regrouped under three components: \n(i) \n\nComponent  1:  Strengthened  hospital  services  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  overall \nproject will assist the government in preparing a hospital development policy and \nstrategic  plan  for  Ulaanbaatar  (output  1),  operationalize  a  hospital  capital \nplanning  system  (output  2),  turn  the  Songinohairkhan  district  hospital  of \nUlaanbaatar  into  a  multifunction  general  hospital  (output  3),  and  improve  the \nhospital governance system (output 4). \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2011.

The project steering committee is chaired by the vice-\nminister  of  health  and  comprises  senior  officials  from  the  MOH,  the  Ministry  of \nPopulation Development and Social Protection, the Ministry of Finance, the State \nSocial  Insurance  General  Office,  the  Health  Sciences  University  of  Mongolia, \nUlaanbaatar  City,  and  the  Mongolian  Association  of  Family  Doctors,  and \nrepresentatives from the GASI, Pharmaceutical Association, Hospital Association, \nand Mongolia Consumer Association.a \nThe  MOH  is  the  executing  agency  and  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  all \noutputs under the DMF, except outputs 3 and 9. \n\n                                                 \n18 The following principles were followed in determining the amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB: (i) the \namount does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to \nADB-financed expenditures, and (iii) the financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of \nthe project. \n\n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Reallocation  of  the  original  grant  proceeds  is  illustrated  in  Section  IV  (Table  B.3.B)  of  the  Project  Administration \nManual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); the adjusted procurement plan of the original \nproject is in Section VI (C.2.)  of the PAM. \n\n\fAspects  \n\n(iii) Key implementing \nagencies \n\n(iv) Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nAdvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nThe  Ulaanbaatar  City  Mayor\u2019s  Office  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the \ndemonstration hospital in the Songinohairkhan district of Ulaanbaatar (output 3 of \nthe  DMF).  GASI  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  upgrade  of  the  drug \ncontrol laboratory (output 9 of the DMF). \nThe PIU of the current project will serve as the PIU for the overall project, including \nadditional financing of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. The PIU will \nbe  composed  of  seven  administrative  and  two  technical  staff.  All  project  financial \nmatters,  procurement,  and  recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  handled  by  the  PIU \nunder the supervision of the MOH. \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nQuality- and cost-based selection \n\n$23.01 million \n$0.33 million \n$0.96 million \n\n1 contract \n1 contract \n2 contracts \n154 person-months \n\nAdvance contracting was approved for one consulting service contract. \nThe grant and loan proceeds for the overall project will be disbursed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMF = design and monitoring framework, GASI = General Agency for Specialized \nInspection, MOH = Ministry of Health, PIU = project implementation unit. \na   The government underwent a recent restructuring whereby the newly created Ministry of Economic Development in \ncharge  of  loan  and  grant  policy,  strategy,  negotiations,  and  ratification  could  join  as  a  member  of  the  project \nsteering committee in the future. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nTechnical \n \n16. \nThe technical aspects of the overall project are sound. A systematic approach is applied \nto  development  of  the  hospital  policy  and  the  strategic  hospital  development  plan  to  ensure \nstakeholder participation, operational feasibility, and financial sustainability. A reputable design \nfirm  will  update  the  preliminary  hospital  site  plan,  including  access,  parking,  and  greenery,  in \nline with improved construction and operational standards. The hospital will be managed by the \ngovernment with support from the private sector. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  viability  of  the  overall  project.  The \nanalysis covers the macroeconomic context so as to review the potential for the government to \ncontinue  to  finance  the  project  activities  in  the  longer  term,  following  project  completion.  The \nanalysis  covers  the  quantifiable  economic  costs  and  benefits  for  the  improved  hospital \ncomponent  and  provides  qualitative  analysis  of  the  drug  safety  component.  The  economic \nimpact  of  unsafe  medicine  is  difficult  to  quantify  because  there  are  a  number  of  unknown \nvariables. Using conservative estimates of project implementation, the baseline results show an \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  11.95%,  reflecting  substantial  unquantifiable \neconomic benefits. The EIRR was tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in \neconomic  benefits  as  the  worst-case  scenario  for  each  of  the  economic  benefits  relating  to \nhospital  efficiency  savings,  out-of-pocket  cost  savings  for  patients,  and  reduction  in  projected \nproductivity  improvements.  Under  these  conservative  assumptions,  the  EIRRs  range  from \n7.59% to 11.01%; hence, the project is considered economically viable.21 \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/OP. Manila (B.[vi][b] states that a low EIRR \n\nis acceptable when there are substantial unquantifiable benefits). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  overall  project  has  no  revenue-earning  component;  hence,  financial  cost  benefits \n18. \nwere  not  analyzed  as  part  of  the  financial  analysis.  The  MOH,  Ulaanbaatar  City  Health \nDepartment, and GASI will contribute counterpart funding and bear the project\u2019s O&M costs. A \nfiscal analysis indicated that the annual average contribution of the MOH to the overall project is \n0.5% of the health sector annual budget. The annual O&M cost, to be borne by GASI, will not \nexceed  2.0%  of  its  current  revenue.  Additional  O&M  costs  required  by  the  Ulaanbaatar  City \nhealth  organizations  for  the  demonstration  hospital  will  be  about  0.6%  of  its  total  annual \nexpenditure.  The  counterpart  funding  and  O&M  costs  are  considered  both  financially \nsustainable  and  affordable.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  MOH  is \nexperienced in managing ADB projects and is prepared for project implementation. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH  for  the  additional  financing  activities.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). The MOH \nhas  been  a  partner  of  ADB  since  1991.  The  project  implementation  unit  established  for  the \ncurrent  project,  which  is  performing  satisfactorily,  will  continue  to  handle  all  project  financial \nmatters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants, supervised by the MOH. The government \nthrough  the  MOH  will  ensure  that  civil  works  supervisory  responsibility  will  be  assigned  to  the \nfirm  in  charge  of  designing  the  new  hospital.  The  Ulaanbaatar  Mayor\u2019s  Office  recently \nunderwent  a  procurement  and  financial  capacity  assessment  for  the  Urban  Transport \nDevelopment  Investment  Program,  which  concluded  that  the  Municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \nfinancial management, procurement, reporting, and monitoring systems are satisfactory. 22 \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  overall  project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  260,000  mostly  poor  residents  of  the \nSonginohairkhan  district  of  Ulaanbaatar  by  improving  district  hospital  services.  Additional \nfinancing  will  improve  the  range  and  quality  of  hospital  services  provided  to  the  population \nbeyond  the  services  that  were  planned  under  the  current  project.  The  overall  project  will  also \nbenefit  the  entire  population  of  Mongolia  by  improving  access  to  safer  drugs,  and,  in  the  long \nrun,  will  improve  allocative  efficiency  in  the  health  sector  by  optimizing  the  use  of  hospital \nservices  and  improving  the  return  on  future  investment  in  hospitals.  Poverty  and  health  are \nstrongly related, and better health services are not only a social goal but also a prerequisite to \neconomic development. Therefore, improved health care will expand the economic opportunities \nof the whole population, including the poor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nhas been updated to reflect the additional financing component. \n \n21. \nThe  current  project  and  the  additional  financing  are  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. In Mongolia, the health status of the population is highly differentiated by sex. \nThe  male  mortality  rate  is  high,  and  male  life  expectancy  is  low  compared  with  females,  due \nprimarily to unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking and heavy drinking. Women comprise the \nmajority of users and providers of the health care system in Mongolia, and 20% of households \nin urban areas in Mongolia are headed by women.23 Women provide the majority of care for ill \nfamily members. The vast majority of the country\u2019s total medical staff consists of women (82%). \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB.  2012.

The  environment  categorization  of  the  current  project  and  additional \nfinancing  is  B.  Environmental  impact  assessments  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \nMongolia  regulatory  framework  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Two  domestic \nenvironmental assessments\u2014for the new Songinohairkhan demonstration hospital and the new \ncentral  laboratory\u2014were  conducted  in  compliance  with  Mongolian  law,  and  approved  by  the \nMinistry  of  Nature,  Environment  and  Tourism.24 The  initial  environmental  examination  of  the \ncurrent  project  was  updated \nthe  new \nSonginohairkhan demonstration hospital, approved by ADB and disclosed on the ADB website \non  24  August  2012.  Potential  adverse  impacts  during  the  construction  and  operation  phases \ninclude  limited  standard  construction  impacts;  and  occupational  and  community  health  and \nsafety issues during operation, especially unsafe collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of \nmedical and chemical hazardous waste. A temporary storage system for medical wastes will be \ninstalled  at  the  new  Songinohairkhan  demonstration  hospital  during  construction  of  the  new \nhospital, and an integrated waste management system in compliance with MOH policies will be \nconstructed at the new hospital.25 The new central laboratory has installed a holding system for \nchemical  and  hazardous  liquid  wastes.  The  new  Songinohairkhan  demonstration  hospital  and \nnew  central  laboratory  will  be  connected  to  the  Ulaanbaatar  centralized  systems  for  water \nsupply,  wastewater  collection,  electricity,  and  heating  systems.  The  updated \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  report  includes  a  comprehensive  environmental  management  plan \nwhich  defines  environmental  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  requirements,  institutional \nresponsibilities, and training and capacity building requirements. The government is committed \nto  managing  identified  environmental  risks  and  has  agreed  on  a  comprehensive  set  of \nenvironment-related loan covenants. The executing agency conducted meaningful consultation \nwith  and  disclosed  relevant  environment  information  to  the  affected  people.  Consultation  and \npublic  participation  will  continue \nimplementation  and  any \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the overall project. \n \n23. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The demonstration hospital will be \nconstructed on the existing government-owned land site where the present hospital is situated. \nThe  site  comprises  sufficient  land  to  accommodate  the  new  construction  within  its  boundaries \nsuch that construction will not cause any resettlement impact. Therefore, the overall project and \nadditional financing remain category C for resettlement; a resettlement plan is not required. The \ncurrent project and additional financing will not have any negative impact on indigenous peoples \nand,  therefore,  the  current  project  and  additional  financing  are  category  C.  No  further  actions \nare required. \n \nF. \n \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \n24. \nMajor risks and  mitigating measures are summarized in  Table 4  and  described in detail in  the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n                                                 \n24 Currently the Ministry of Environment and Green Development. \n25 Ministerial  orders  158  and  179  of  2011  on  procedures  for  health  care  waste  collection,  sorting,  storage, \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nthroughout  overall  project \n\ntransportation, disposal, and processing. \n\n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nLack of government support for hospital \nreform \n\nStaff and community resistance during \nestablishment of the demonstration \nhospital in Songinohairkhan \n\nThe implementing agencies have \ninsufficient capacity, and fraud and \ncorruption in the procurement process \nare risks. \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nThe  overall  project  will  ensure  continuing  policy  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment  and  donor  community.  The  high-level  steering \ncommittee  established  to  oversee  hospital  reform  will  approve  a \nproject communication strategy to support hospital reform. \nThe  overall  project  will  establish  a  strong  communication  strategy \n(including \nfeedback \nthe  grievance  redress  mechanism)  and \nmechanism  (such  as  patient  satisfaction  surveys  and  community \nscore cards) to keep the public and staff well informed and closely \ninvolved in new developments.  \nAll  procurement  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and \ncoordinated  by  the  project  implementation  unit.  The  Ministry  has \nmore  than  10  years  of  procurement  experience  following  Asian \nDevelopment Bank policies and guidelines. To minimize the risk of \ncorruption, Ministry of Finance representatives will participate in all \nprocurement  evaluation  procedures,  and  contract  awards  will  be \nmade  public  by  posting  on  the  project  website  and  at  www.e-\nprocurement.mn. \nProvision  is  made  for  sufficient  contingency  funding,  including  an \nassurance  in  the  additional  financing  project  that  the  government \nwill pay for any shortfall in funding. \n\nHigh inflation and appreciating local \ncurrency due to the booming economy \nresult in escalating project costs \n    Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n25. \nThe  government  and  MOH  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  additional \nfinancing shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n26. \nThe  government  and  MOH  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \noverall  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  grant  agreement  of  the  current  project  and  the  loan \nagreement for the additional financing. Due to project modification introduced with the additional \nfinancing, the time frames for performance of selected covenants in the loan agreement relating \nto the hospital reform component have been extended for an additional 12 months. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n27. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR16,240,000  to  Mongolia  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Fourth \nHealth  Sector  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n\n15 October 2012 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Overall \nProject) \n\n \nNo \nchange \n\nDesign Summary \n(Current Project) \nImpact \nImproved health \nstatus of the \nMongolian \npopulation, \nincluding the poor \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n(Current Project) \n\n \nPoverty level reduced from 36.2% \nin 2008 to 18.0% by 2020 \n \nMaternal mortality reduced from \n60 per 100,000 live births as of \nFebruary 2010 to 30 per 100,000 \nlive births in 2020 \n\n \nNo \nchange \n\nOutcome \nImproved health \nsector efficiency, \ngovernance, and \ndrug safety \n\n \nStrategic hospital development \nplan for Ulaanbaatar and capital \ninvestment planning system in \nplace by 2016 \nAt least 50% reduction in the \nnumber of illegal, counterfeit, \nsubstandard, or not quality-\nassured drugs on the market in \n2016 from 26% in 2007 \nA transparent public reporting \nsystem on hospital performances \nand drug safety in place by 2016 \nComponent 1: Strengthened Hospital Services in Ulaanbaatar \n \nOutputs \n1.
