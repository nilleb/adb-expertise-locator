The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Accelerating  Policy  Reforms  in  Secondary  Education  and  if  the \nBoard  approves  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  and  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe program is the response of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the government\u2019s \nvision  of  improving  the  quality  of  its  human  resources  to  sustain  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment and enhance its competitiveness. This will be achieved by supporting sequenced \nreforms  aimed  at  improving  the  effectiveness  of  upper  secondary  education  (USE).  The \nprogram  will  (i)  support  initiatives to improve access  to, quality  of,  and relevance of  USE;  and  \n(ii) strengthen institutional capacity for planning, management, and delivery of education. While \nthe policy reforms will be applied nationwide, most of the project activities will be implemented in \nseven disadvantaged provinces.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  problems.  Cambodia  experienced  rapid  growth  from  2000  to  2015. \nDuring 2011\u20132013, its gross domestic product grew by an average rate of 7.0% per year, and in \n2015, it grew by 7.1%. Structural transformation contributed to the country\u2019s impressive growth, \nwith services accounting for 40% of Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product, and industry for 25% \nin 2013.3 As a result of rapid growth, Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate declined from 47.8% in 2008 to \n18.9% in 2012. However, despite the rapid poverty reduction, 71% of the population, particularly \nin rural areas, lives on less than $3 a day. \n \n4. \nRapid  economic  growth  and  diversification  have  been  accompanied  by  an  increase  in \ndemand  for  a  skilled  workforce.  However,  the  education  system  has  not  kept  up  with  these \nstructural  changes  and  skills  gaps  have  widened. 4 While  there  was  substantial  progress  in \nincreasing  access  to  basic  education  over  the  last  10  years,  with  near  universal  enrollment  at \nthe  primary  level  and  increased  lower  secondary  enrollment  as  of  SY2015/16,  significant \nchallenges  remain  at  the  USE  level.  The  USE  gross  enrollment  rate  declined  from  32.9% \n(30.1% female) in SY2010/11 to 25.1% (26.0% female) in SY2015/16. This dismal performance \nis  more  particularly  pronounced  in  disadvantaged  provinces,  with  recorded  average  gross \nenrollment below 20% as of SY2013/2014. Grade 12 dropout rates reached an all-time high of \n45%  (42%  female)  in  SY2015/16,  an  increase  of  34.9  percentage  points  (32.2  percentage \npoints  for  females)  from  SY2011/12.  Completion  rates  for  USE  remained  low  at  20%  in  SY \n2014/15.5 A 2014 study showed that many students leave upper secondary school  (USS) with \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Koh  Kong,  Mondulkiri,  Otdar  Meanchey,  Pailin,  Preah  Vihear,  Rattanakiri,  and  Stung  Treng.    Disadvantaged \nprovinces are defined as those with (i) difficult transport access, (ii) a population density of fewer than 10 people \nper  square  kilometer,  (iii)  permanent  flooding  or  drought  areas,  (iv)  border  areas,  and  (v)  incomplete  schools \n(schools in remote or disadvantaged areas without complete grades due to lack of classrooms or teachers).  \n\n3  IndexMundi.

The  government  recognizes  that  it  will  require  a  pool  of  skilled \n5. \nworkers \nits \ncompetitiveness. To achieve its  growth objectives, the government  puts a priority  on resolving \nthe challenges of low access to USE, low quality and relevance of USE, and weak institutional \ncapacity to deliver education services. \n \nLow access to upper secondary education. The low participation and high dropout in \n6. \nUSE are attributed to both demand- and supply-side constraints. On the demand side, the high \nopportunity  cost  of  schooling  among  poor  students  poses  disincentives  to  attending  USS. \nEconomic  pressures  on  poor  households\u2019  resources  due  to  direct  or  indirect  income foregone \nimpacts the  decision  to either  attend  or  drop  out  of  school.  In Cambodia,  a traditional  code of \nconduct  for  women  restrains  their  access  to  education  opportunities.  The  inadequate  MoEYS \nbudget  for  USE,  and  inefficiencies  in  spending  at  subnational  and  school  levels  constrain  the \nexpansion  of  USSs  in  the  disadvantaged  provinces.  This  poses  barriers  to  attendance,  since \nmany USSs in the disadvantaged provinces are either too far from home, overcrowded or in a \nstate  of  disrepair,  or  lack  usable  water  and  toilets. 7  The  lack  of  teachers  in  rural  and \ndisadvantaged areas due to difficult teaching and living conditions (i.e., large class sizes, double \nshifting, poor living conditions, and transportation challenges) discourage student attendance. \n \n7. \nLow  quality  and  relevance.  The  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  and  teacher  trainers \nremains  a  major  constraint  to  achieving  quality  outcomes  of  USE.  Approximately  86%  of \nCambodian  teachers  have  qualifications  below  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree.8 In-service  training  and \nprofessional  development  opportunities  have  been  limited.  Pre-service  trainings  do  not \nadequately  address  the  lack  of  mastery  of  content  or  knowledge  of  effective  pedagogy  to \nenhance  student  learning  and  interest.  The  inequity  in  the  distribution  of  qualified  teachers  is \nalso  an  issue.  Some  specialized  subjects  such  as  in  math,  science,  and  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  are  taught  by  teachers  with  not  enough  qualification  in  the \nfield.  The  inadequate  USE  budget  impedes  the  provision  of  critical  teaching  and  learning \nresources  (e.g.,  textbooks,  equipment,  science  and  computer  laboratories)  to  upgrade  the \nstudents\u2019  proficiency  in  the  specialized  USE  subjects.  Inputs  given  to  secondary  resource \nschools  (SRS)  are  underutilized  due  to  lack  of  maintenance  and  operation  funds.9 Employer \nsurveys highlight the skills gaps due to the lack of relevance of the curriculum to the skills and \ncompetency requirements in the labor market.10  \n \nWeak  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  deliver,  and  manage  education  services.  A \n8. \npervasive  factor  in  poor  USE  performance  is  the  weak  management  capacity  in  resource \nplanning  and  utilization,  especially  at  the  subnational  levels.  Weak  school  management  has \nconstrained  the  ability  of  schools  to  flexibly  respond  to  their  needs.  Monitoring  capacity  at  all \nlevels  of  the  MoEYS  is  limited,  and  the  education  management  information  system  (EMIS) \n                                                \n6 S.

The \n9. \ngovernment prioritizes education and skills development in line with its Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  Phase  III.11 The  National  Strategic  Development \nPlan,  2014\u20132018  emphasizes mainstreaming  of scientific  and  technological knowledge and  its \napplication  in  academic  curriculums  in  secondary  education.12 The  Education  Strategic  Plan, \n2014\u20132018 focuses on policies to improve equitable access, quality and relevance and enhance \neffective  leadership  and  management  across  all  levels.13 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n2014\u20132018 for  Cambodia  is  aligned with the government\u2019s  priorities  to improve  access  to  and \nrelevance and quality of secondary education.14 \n \n10. \nADB value added in the education sector.  ADB has provided substantial investments \nin education and technical and vocational education and training (TVET), reflecting ADB\u2019s long-\nterm  commitment  to  education  in  Cambodia.  The  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(ESDP),  the second  ESDP,  and the  ongoing  third ESDP focused  on  increasing  access  to  and \nquality  of  lower  secondary  education.  The  Enhancing  Education  Quality  Project  supported \nquality improvements through the establishment of SRS equipped to support student learning.15 \nThe  Upper  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (USESDP)  will  contribute  to \naddressing  unmet  needs  at  the  underserved  USE  level.  It  will  build  on  the  critical  reforms \ninitiated in the previous ADB programs such as (i) advocating for sustained increases in budget \nallocation  to  education,  (ii)  setting  standards  for  effective  secondary  schools,  (iii)  establishing \nprograms to address specific needs of the poor and disadvantaged, and (iv) initiating programs \nto  improve  competencies  of  teachers  and  teacher  trainers  in  secondary  education.  ADB\u2019s \nsupport to the government\u2019s public financial management reform program, including in key line \nagencies such as the MoEYS, will help address the financial management  issues constraining \neffective and efficient delivery of education services, including in USE.16 \n \n11. \nLessons learned. Some lessons learned include the need to (i) align the policy reforms  \nwith government\u2019s capacity to fully implement the reforms, and provide adequate TA support to \ndevelop and implement policy reforms in key areas; (ii) build capacity of implementing agencies \nto  facilitate  project  implementation;  (iii)  provide  a  strong  fiduciary  and  fiscal  framework  to \nadvance  sector  reforms;  (iv)  strengthen  the  EMIS  to  facilitate  monitoring,  and  enhance  data-\nbased  decision-making;  and  (v)  provide  strong  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program \ninterventions to strengthen implementation. \n\n                                                \n11 Government of Cambodia. 2013.

Major  education  development  partners \n\nin \n12. \nCambodia  include  the  European  Union;  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency;  the \nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency;  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF); the  United  Nations Education,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO);  and \nthe  World  Bank.  An  education  sector  working  group  serves  as  the  main  platform  for  regular \ndialogue and coordination. Major investments by development partners, have focused on basic \neducation. The program has been designed in consultation with these partners.  \n \nThe  Sector  Development  Program  modality  with  a  policy-based  loan,  project  loan \n13. \ncomponent and TA will engage ADB and the government over the next 5 years in the education \nsector  and  help  meet  the  sector  needs  in  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  manner.  Identified \nreforms  to the  sector require  long-term  engagement,  as these  will  take time to  implement  and \nshow development impact. The USESDP will enable ADB to leverage its contribution to support \nthe government\u2019s USE reform program and harmonize development partners\u2019 assistance.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe impact will be the development of high-quality human resources. The outcome will \nbe improved effectiveness of the USE system. USESDP contains 14 policy actions, all of which \nhave been completed from January 2015 to July 2016. These policy actions provide the guiding \nframework or policy bases in the implementation of the investment component of the USESDP.  \n \nC. \n \nOutput  1:  Access  to  upper  secondary  education  improved.  For  the  policy  actions \n15. \nunder  output  1,  the  government  has  established  a  three-tier  student  scholarship  program \ntargeting  (i)  poor  USE  students;  (ii)  USE  science  and  math  students  from  disadvantaged \nprovinces,  using  household\u2019s  income  poverty  status,  student  merit,  and  gender  as  selection \ncriteria;  and  (iii)  academically  outstanding science and math students from  non-disadvantaged \nprovinces to incentivize them to enroll in the science stream.17 To improve teacher deployment \nin  areas  with  high  teacher  shortage,  the  government  has  established,  budgeted  for,  and \nimplemented a hardship allowance program. \n \n16. \nUnder the project, the number of USE facilities in the seven disadvantaged provinces will \nbe  expanded.  Classrooms  will  be  provided  in  10  overcrowded  USSs,  while  5  existing  lower \nsecondary schools will be upgraded to offer USE with classrooms and water and toilets. Eleven \nexisting  USSs  will  be  repaired  and  rehabilitated.  Scholarship  grants  will  be  provided  to \noutstanding  science  stream  students  in  USE  selected  based  on  merit,  with  60%  of  the \nbeneficiaries  being  female,  to  encourage  high-performing  students,  including  those  from  poor \nfamilies,  to  complete  USE  and  expand  the  pool  of  better-qualified  entrants  for  the  science \nstream  at  the  tertiary  level. 18 The  project  will  provide  (i)  hardship  allowances  to  938  USS \nteachers in the seven disadvantaged provinces, (ii) scholarships for a 1-year pre-service training \non  science  and  math  at  the  National  Institute  of  Education  to  500  eligible  teacher  candidates \nfrom  disadvantaged  provinces,  and  (iii)  44  teacher  housing  units  in  areas  of  high  need.19 A \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n17 The science stream includes math and science. \n18 Based on their scores in the qualifying exam for scholarship grants to be given by the MoEYS. \n19 The  MoEYS\u2019  criteria  include  the  following:  (i)  disadvantaged  provinces;  (ii)  USSs  with  shortage  of  teachers;  (iii) \nschools  with  teachers  transferring  from  other  areas, especially  female  teachers;  (iv)  hard-to-reach  schools  within \nlimited  safe  geographical  location;  (v)  schools  with  long  teaching  hours;  (vi)  schools  with  teachers  who  are  poor \nand  have  low  living  standards;  (vii)  schools  with  newly  married  teachers  and  who  come  from  distant  areas;  and \n(viii) schools with increasing student enrollment. \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\fgender-responsive communication strategy and awareness campaigns will also be developed to \nenhance parents\u2019 and communities\u2019 knowledge about the value of investing in education. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Quality  and  relevance  of  upper  secondary  education  improved.  The \npolicy actions under output 2 include the government\u2019s strengthening of STEM education. The \ngovernment  has  established  policy  directions  on  in-service  and  pre-service  training  and \nprofessional  development  opportunities  for  STEM  teachers  and  administrators,  promotion  of \ngender  equality  in STEM  education,  and  establishment  of math  and  science study  clubs  in 50 \nUSSs.  Quality  assurance  measures  in  USE  have  been  implemented  through  the  adoption  of \nguidelines on the establishment and management of SRSs, and the development of a school-\nlevel  quality  assurance  framework  focusing  on  systematic  inspection  of  schools,  school-level \nself-evaluation  and  standards  for  effective  support  and  service  to  teachers,  and  school \nmanagement for quality improvement based on needs assessment. Complementary reforms in \ncurriculum  and  assessment  have  been  implemented,  including  the  adoption  of  the  curriculum \nframework  for  general  and  technical  education,  the  conduct  of  the  grade  11  assessment,  and \nthe dissemination of the grade 12 examination results to teachers and education staff to inform \nthe  design  of  interventions  to  address  students\u2019  weaknesses  and  least-learned  skills.  To \naddress  long-standing  issues  on  low  teacher  qualifications,  the  government  implemented  its \ncomprehensive  teacher  policy  focused  on  improving  teacher  deployment,  quality,  and \nperformance and allocated adequate budget for its effective implementation. \n \n18. \nThe  project  will  support  (i)  the  review  and  upgrading  of  the  science,  math,  and  ICT \ncurriculum at the USE level to align with international standards; (ii) quality reviews of textbooks \nand  teacher  guides  to  ensure  curriculum  alignment  and  error-free  textbooks;  all  grade  12 \nstudents  will  be  provided  textbooks  for  all  subjects  at  a  1:1  student\u2013textbook  ratio  while  USS \nteachers  will  have  teacher  guides  on  all  grade  12  subjects;  and  (iii)  quality  improvement  of \nscience,  math,  and  ICT  teachers  through  review  of  training  curriculum  of  pre-service  and  in-\nservice  teacher  training;  professional  development  of  USE  science,  math,  and  ICT  teacher \neducators  through  pre-service  teacher  training  and  USE  science,  math,  and  ICT  teachers \nthrough  in-service  teacher  training.  The  MoEYS  will  engage  an  internationally  recognized \nregional education institute to support the implementation of these various activities. All teacher \ntraining programs will include a module on career guidance and entrepreneurship concepts for \nUSE  students  based  on  successful  pilots.  The  project  will  upgrade  12  USSs  to  SRSs,  with  a \ncomplete set of learning facilities and school equipment. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \neducation  strengthened.  Under  the  policy-based  loan  component,  the  MoEYS  implemented \nfunctional  assessment,  performance \nrelevant \ndecentralized offices of education and the Research and Teacher Assessment Office within the \nMoEYS\u2019s Teacher Training Department to enhance the effectiveness of support to teachers. To \ninform  evidence-based  planning  and  budgeting,  the  MoEYS  updated  the  Education  Strategic \nPlan, 2014\u20132018, including strategies, priorities, and targets. \n \nThe project will (i) strengthen monitoring and evaluation of SRSs and network schools20 \n20. \nthrough  staff  training  of  MoEYS  departments,  the  provincial  and  district  offices  of  education, \nSRS  directors,  and  network  schools  to  promote  effective  utilization  of  school  resources;  (ii) \nstrengthen the EMIS through server upgrading, database integration, and capacity development \nof MoEYS staff on data management and analysis; (iii) train USS management on strengthening \nSRS network schools to optimally utilize learning resources and the School Improvement Fund \n\nreview,  and  capacity  development  of \n\n                                                \n20 Refers to a cluster of secondary schools that are in close proximity to any secondary resource school. \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\n\f(SIF); 21 (iv)  provide  SIF  support  to  48  SRSs  and  240  network  schools,  with  guidelines  on \nefficient  utilization  and fund  liquidation;  (v)  support the  newly  established  MoEYS  departments \nof  examination,  ICT,  and  policy  through  staff  development  training,  and  provision  of  office \nfurniture and equipment; (vi) support the Education Research Council in the production of policy \nbriefs  and  journals,  and  in  the  hosting  of  the  annual  research  forum;  and  (vii)  develop  an  SIF \nfinancial management manual for SRSs and network schools, install a computerized accounting \nsystem, and train staff in relevant MoEYS departments. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nOverall  program  financing.  The  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $48  million  (Table  1). \nADB  will  provide  a  policy-based  loan  of  SDR10,752,000 ($15  million  equivalent)  and  a  project \nloan of  SDR21,505,000   ($30 million  equivalent).

The  TA  is \nestimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Implementation period will be from January 2017 \nto  June  2018.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The MoEYS will be the executing agency. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nThe program is expected to bring about significant economic benefits in terms of improved \nfuture  earnings  of  USE  students  who  complete  the  USE  curriculum  and  who  decide  to  find \nemployment immediately after passing grade 12. The incremental economic benefits derived from \nthe annual income generated by USE students finding employment are projected to increase from \n$0.90 million in 2021 to $130.47 million in 2041. Total economic benefits from improved income-\ngenerating capacity of USE graduates over the period is estimated at about $1,321.55 million. The \nestimated economic benefits from improved efficiency in upper secondary schools are estimated \nat about $0.57 million in 2021 and projected to increase to $11.88 million in 2041. The calculated \neconomic internal rate of return for the project investments is about 13.8%, indicating its economic \nviability. Fiscal impact analysis confirms that the government has adequate financial resources \nand will be able to fulfill all its financial obligations under the program. \n \nB. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  revealed  insufficient  financial  management \n27. \ncapacity  at  the  subnational  level.  The  development  of  the  financial  management  manual  and \ncapacity  strengthening  activities  will  be  conducted  under  the  project  to  improve  financial \nmanagement  capacity.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  and  procurement \nrisk \nassessment showed that the Procurement Unit of the MoEYS can handle procurement of works, \ngoods,  and  services  for  the  program  with  the  additional  full-time  support  of  a  national \nprocurement specialist. For more efficient delivery, procurement may be handled by the project \ncoordination unit that will be set up to manage the day-to-day implementation of the program. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MoEYS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 22). \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe poverty impact was assessed based on the distribution of incremental benefits and \ncosts  generated  by  the  reforms  supported  by  the  project  and  the  policy  loan  component. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n23 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIncremental  benefits  will  be  generated  from  (i)  improved  income-generating  capacity  of  USE \ngraduates  who  seek  employment  rather  than  pursue  higher  education,  and  (ii)  improved \nefficiency in the management of schools and in the delivery of upper secondary education. The \neconomic analysis indicates that 16% of total program benefits are shared by the poor. \n \n30. \nThe  policy-based  loan  and  the  project  are  categorized  as  \u201cgender  equity  as  a  theme.\u201d \nThe policy actions under the policy-based loan are designed to achieve the following objectives: \n(i) 60% of poor scholars are female, (ii) the hardship allowance program gives special emphasis \nto female teachers, and (iii) gender equality in STEM education is promoted. The gender action \nplan for the project will achieve the following: (i) undertake a gender assessment on the impact \nof student and teacher scholarships; (ii) 40% female trainees for in-service math, science, ICT, \nand  career  counseling  training;  (iii)  all  females  currently  in  management  positions  receive \nmanagement  training;  (iv)  of the  teacher  candidates  and/or qualified teacher  training  providers \nfor  National  Institute  of  Education  fellowships,  at  least  40%  are  female;  (v)  prioritizing  female \nteachers for housing units in schools; and (vi) disaggregating EMIS data by sex and ethnicity.24 \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe project is classified as indigenous peoples category B. Ethnic minority students and \nstaff  make  up  a  large  percentage  of  the  project\u2019s  target  schools  in  at  least  five  of  the  seven \ndisadvantaged  provinces.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nmeasures to ensure that students, teachers, and school administrators in ethnic minority areas \nare  included  in  the  project  design  in  lieu  of  preparing  a  separate  ethnic  group  plan. 25 The \ninvoluntary  resettlement  category  is  C.  The  program  as  a  whole  will  not  entail  involuntary \nresettlement  issues.  The  project  activities,  including  construction  of  additional  USS  buildings \nand teacher housing, will not require land acquisition nor restrict access to lands and/or people\u2019s \nlivelihoods  since  school  campuses  occupy  large  tracts  of  land  with  adequate  room  for  future \nexpansion.  Due  diligence  has  confirmed  that  targeted  project  areas  have  land  titles  and/or \ncertificates  indicating  ownership  of  land  by  the  school  or  by  the  MoEYS.  Based  on  an \nassessment of the policy actions, the policy-based loan component will  not have any potential \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples issues. \n \nThe  project  will  include  the  construction  of  school  buildings  and/or  classrooms  and \n32. \nteacher  housing.  While  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  during  construction,  these  are \nprincipally  confined  to  noise,  dust,  and  vibration,  and  safety  of  students  and  school  and/or \ntraining  center  staff.  Impacts  will  be  minor,  localized,  temporary,  and  could  adequately  be \naddressed and covered in the civil works contract awards. The project is classified as category \nB  for  environment.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  have been  prepared.26  The  policy  actions  in  the  policy-based  loan \ncomponent will not have any potential environmental impacts. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \n\n                                                \n24   Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  \u201cIf  Indigenous  Peoples  are  the  sole  or  overwhelming  majority  of  direct  project  beneficiaries,  and  when  only \npositive impacts are identified, the elements of an Indigenous Peoples plan could be included in the overall project \ndesign in lieu of preparing a separate Indigenous Peoples plan.\u201d ADB. 2009.
