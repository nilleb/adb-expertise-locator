It  will  have  four \noutputs:  (i)  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  expansion, \n(ii) mobility  improvement,  (iii)  urban  management  strengthening,  and  (iv)  project  management \nand capacity development.2\n  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nUnprecedented urban growth3 coupled with inadequate urban infrastructure has resulted \n3. \nin  a  shortfall  of  basic  urban  services  for  Bhutan\u2019s  urban  residents.  Infrastructure  requirements \nacross urban centers vary, but access to water, sanitation, solid waste management, and urban \ntransport  are  often  inadequate.  The  government\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  identifies  the  need  to \ninvest in urban infrastructure and management in Bhutan\u2019s two major municipalities\u2014Thimphu \nand Phuentsholing\u2014and other larger urban centers4\n to ensure sustainable urban management. \n \nThimphu Municipality is Bhutan\u2019s capital, with a population of 92,0005 making up 40% of \n4. \nBhutan\u2019s  urban  population.  This  population  is  expected  to  double  by  2025. 6  Thimphu\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategy 7  identifies  four  primary  issues  in  the  infrastructure  and  environment \nsector: (i) water supply, (ii) wastewater collection and treatment, (iii) drainage and flooding, and \n(iv) solid waste collection and disposal. The ongoing Urban Infrastructure Development Project \n(UIDP) 8 supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  covers  water  supply,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  and  wastewater  collection.  The  UIDP  and  Thimphu\u2019s  local  area  plan  identifies \nwastewater  management  as  a  priority  issue  in  Thimphu,  with  water  pollution  from  wastewater \ndischarge, 9  solid  waste,  and  effluent  from  workshops  and  industries  degrading  the  urban \nenvironment.10\n \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA). ADB. 2010. Technical \n\nAssistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Urban Infrastructure Project. Manila. \n\n3  Bhutan\u2019s  urban  population  comprises  31%  of  the  total  population;  by  2020,  more  than  50%  of  the  population  is \nexpected  to  be  living  in  urban  areas  (ADB.  2009.  Country  Partnership  Strategy  Midterm  Review:  Bhutan,  2006\u2013\n2010. Manila). \n\n4  This includes the four municipalities that are autonomous and are now responsible for the provision of all municipal \nservices  (Gelephu,  Phuentsholing,  SJM,  and  Thimphu)  and  five  regional  growth  centers,  one  of  which  is  the \nNganglam Dunghkha Administration. \n\n5  Based on the 2005 census population of 79,185 and 2.5% growth rate. \n6  Government of Bhutan. 2003.

No  additional \nconnections  have  been  allowed  since  2010  to  prevent  overloading  of  the  treatment  plant.  South  Thimphu  and \nsections of the core city with laterals produces 6 MLD of wastewater.  \n\n10 Government  of  Bhutan.  2007.  Bhutan  Millennium  Development  Goals  Needs  Assessment  and  Costing  Report. \n\nThimphu. \n\n\f5. \nFollowing Thimphu Municipality, Phuentsholing Municipality is the second largest urban \ncenter  in  Bhutan.  The  2005  urban  population  of  20,537  is  expected  to  increase  to  31,996  by \n2025.11 It  is  the  busiest  commercial  hub  where  most  of  the  country\u2019s  cross-border  trade  takes \nplace. Its urban development plan12 identifies congestion and poor urban mobility as a key issue \nthat restricts the municipality\u2019s growth. There is only one entry and exit point for the core area, \nwhich  results  in  traffic  congestion  from  local  traffic  and  trucks  transporting  goods  to  and  from \nThimphu,  and  containers  carrying  raw  materials  and  finished  goods  to  and  from  the  Pasakha \nindustrial  area.  Bypass  roads  and  bridges  are required  to  divert  traffic  and  reduce  congestion, \nprovide  an  alternative  crossing  over  the  Om  Chu  River  to  connect  the  eastern  and  western \nportions of the municipality, and accommodate the expected traffic from the proposed dry port. \nIn  addition,  to  avoid  border  traffic  passing  through  the  core  area,  a  second  border  gate  is \nproposed  that  will  link  directly  to  the  proposed  bypass  road. 13\n The  UIDP  has  contributed  to \nrehabilitating and improving roads and other municipal services in Phuentsholing. \n \nSJM  has  recently 14  been  designated  the  fourth  municipality  of  Bhutan.  The  urban \n6. \npopulation of 5,952 in 2005 is expected to almost triple by 2025. In addition, the satellite town of \nDeothang  with  a  current  population  of  about  2,000  was  subsumed  under  SJM  when  it  was \ndesignated  a  municipality.  While  the  municipality  serves  as  the  gateway  to  six  districts  of \neastern  Bhutan  and  is  one  of  the  oldest  urban  areas,  there  has  been  considerably  less \ninvestment  in  urban  infrastructure  compared  with  the  other  three  municipalities  (Gelephu, \nPhuentsholing,  and  Thimphu).  This  burdens  existing  infrastructure  in  an  area  that  is  rapidly \nexpanding  and  has  large  growth  potential  as  a  trade  node  with  the  development  of  the  Asian \nHighways Project and the proposed east\u2013west transnational highway. Structure and local area \nplans15 identify the need to improve road infrastructure, which is unplanned; water supply, which \nhas insufficient capacity to meet current demands, lacks treatment, is of poor quality, and does \nnot  meet  potable  standards;  water  distribution,  which  is  badly  deteriorated  with  high  leakage; \nsanitation, which is currently restricted to on-site facilities not properly maintained; and drainage, \nwhich  is  primarily  an  open  drain  system.    A  study16 commissioned  by  the  government  shows \nthat,  based  on  projected  water  demand  of  3.7  million  liters  per  day  (MLD),  current  sources  of \n1.1 MLD  will  not  be  sufficient.  A  comparison  of  supply  and  consumption  of  water  suggests \nnonrevenue water was over 50% in July 2011.17\n \n \nNganglam,  which  was  designated  the  growth  center  of  southeastern  Bhutan  and \n7. \nidentified as a nationally important urban center18 with large industrial development potential,19\n \n\n                                                \n11 Government of Bhutan. 2005.

A  hydroelectric  plant  (1,800  megawatts)  is  also  planned  40  kilometers  away  from  Nganglam.  The  new \nsecond  east\u2013west  transnational  highway  and  Gyalposhig\u2013Nganglam  national  highway,  both  under  construction, \nwill connect Nganglam to other towns of Bhutan. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fhas  not  adequately  invested  in  urban  infrastructure.  Nganglam\u2019s  investment  plan 20\n identifies \nurban  expansion  to  the  planned  Rinchenthang  town  with  water  supply  and  urban  transport  as \npriority  urban  infrastructure  needs. Infrastructure  investments  in  Bhutan\u2019s  urban  areas  need to \nbe preceded by further planning and detailed design. \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  government  plans  and  strategies,  and  with  the  inclusive \n8. \nsocial  development  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  Bhutan  country  partnership  strategy, 21 which  aims  to \nimprove  urban  infrastructure  services,  upgrade  city  planning,  and  strengthen  the  planning  and \nmanagement  functions  of  municipalities.  It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020 22  as  it \ncontributes  to  regional  outcomes  in  terms  of  Millennium  Development  Goal  7;  Bhutan\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  specifically  urban  infrastructure,  which  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  five  core  areas  of \nspecialization;  and  environmentally  sustainable  development.  Lessons  learned  from  past  and \nongoing urban projects and the country assistance program evaluation23\n are incorporated in the \nproject. These include: (i) expanded assistance for integrated urban development in key urban \ncenters; (ii) continued involvement in the sector as key to capacity building of municipalities and \nfor meeting municipal service requirements of rapidly growing populations; (iii) the ability of local \ngovernments to plan budgets, manage operation and maintenance (O&M), and deal with private \nsector  service  providers  requires  considerable  strengthening  and  technical  capacity  building; \nand  (iv) local  governments  have  low  revenue  bases  and  struggle  to  provide  basic  O&M,  thus \nrequiring gradual introduction of cost-reflective utility tariffs and user fees. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  sustainable  access  to  urban  services  in  Chukha, \nPemagatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Thimphu districts (dzongkhags). The expected outcome \nis that Phuentsholing, SJM, and Thimphu municipalities (thromde), and Nganglam Town (throm) \nwill provide improved urban infrastructure to its residents. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nTo  achieve  outcomes,  the  project  will  have  four  outputs.  Output  1:  WSS  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and expansion will (i) rehabilitate the existing water supply system24 in SJM, and \n(ii)  construct  a  wastewater  treatment  plant  in  Thimphu  Municipality.  This  output  will  include \nprovision  of  access  and  connections  for WSS  to  public  primary  and  secondary  schools  within \nWSS  service  areas  improved  or  constructed  through  the  project.  Output  1  will  ensure  major \ninfrastructure  is  properly  operated  and  maintained  through  provision  of  required  equipment,25\n \nthrough  design\u2013build\u2013operate  contracts.  Output  2:  mobility \nand  outsourcing  of  O&M \nimprovement will construct a bridge and road access in Phuentsholing and resurface sections of \nassociated  existing  roads.  This  output  includes  provision  of  road  maintenance  equipment  for \nproper O&M. Output 3: urban management strengthening will include (i) urban planning through \n\n                                                \n20 Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  and  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Engineering  Services.  2010. \nSocio-Economic Environment and Investment Plan.

The  existing  lagoon  facility,  with  an  area  of  4.9  hectares,  was  an \nappropriate  low  technology  solution 31 when  constructed  in  1992.  However,  because  of  rapid \npopulation  growth,  it  is  now  treating  only  about  17%  (1.75  MLD)  of  wastewater  generated.  To \ntreat  2020  design  flows  of  14  MLD,  an  additional  36  hectares  would  be  required  using  the \nlagoon  process.  However,  as  a  result  of  land  restrictions  in  the  narrow  river  valley  below \nThimphu, such a large land area is unavailable. A mechanical WWTP is the only viable option. \nWhile  a  number  of  possible  process  options  exist,  the  three  most  practical  in  terms  of  capital \nand O&M costs, local climate and temperature considerations, local wastewater characteristics, \nand Bhutan\u2019s effluent standards were evaluated and cost estimates prepared.32\n The O&M of the \nproposed WWTP will require skilled operators, electricity, chemicals, and other recurring costs. \nWhile  Thimphu  Municipality\u2019s  Sewage  Section  has  experience  with  O&M  of  small  mechanical \npackage plants, the new WWTP is of significantly larger capacity. \n \n                                                \n29 ADB. 2011.

Additional  LPSCs \nand PIUs will be established in Nganglam Town and SJM. \n31 No power requirement and low operator skill level requirement. \n32 The actual process will be as offered by the winning bidder, but the three options evaluated are representative of \n\nexpected costs. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f17. \nTo  address  the  lack  of  mechanical  WWTP  process  experience  in  Bhutan,  the  WWTP \ncontract will be procured as design\u2013build\u2013operate whereby the operation of the new WWTP is \nproposed to be done by the contractor for a 3-year period. \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n15 February 2012\u201314 February 2018 \n14 February 2018 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nProject steering committee \nMOWHS (chair) \nDepartment of Public Aid, Ministry of Finance; DUDES, MOWHS; Gross \nNational Happiness Commission; National Environment Commission; \nNational Commission on Women and Children; Planning and Policy Division \n(MOWHS); Thimphu Municipality; Phuentsholing Municipality; SJM; \nNganglam Town; Bhutan Power Corporation; development partners \n(members) \nLocal project steering committee for Thimphu, Phuentsholing, SJM, and \nNganglam Town \nMayor thrompon or town head (dungpa) [chair] \nMunicipal agencies in the urban sector and other stakeholders (members) \nDUDES, MOWHS \nThimphu, Phuentsholing, SJM, Nganglam Town, and DUDES \nPMU, four staff; PIU-Thimphu, five staff; PIU-Phuentsholing, four staff; PIU-\nSJM, four staff; and PIU-Nganglam Town, three staff \nICB \nNCB \nShopping \nQCBS (project \nmanagement \nconsultant) \nQCBS (design, \nmonitoring, and \nsupervision consultant) \nQCBS (urban \nmanagement \nconsultant) \nTendering and bid evaluation of equipment and civil works packages and \nrecruitment of consultants \nThis includes (i) shopping for chlorinators in SJM; (ii) ICB, and bid \nevaluation for Phuentsholing bridge and access roads; and (iii) recruitment \nof project management, design, management, and supervision, and urban \nmanagement consultants. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\n2 contracts \n1 contracts \n3 contracts \n68 person-months \n\n$15.630 million \n$0.890 million \n$0.180 million \n$0.635 million \n\n111 person-months \n\n18 person-months \n\n$1.098 million \n\n$0.340 million \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  DUDES  =  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Engineering  Services; \nICB = international  competitive  bidding;  MOWHS  =  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement;  NCB  =  national \ncompetitive bidding; PIU = project implementation unit; PMU = project management unit; QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection; SJM = Samdrup Jongkhar Municipality. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nO&M costs for various process options are likely to be similar as the majority of the cost \n18. \nof  operating  a  mechanical  WWTP  is  approximately  electricity  (60%),  chemicals  (15%), \nreplacement parts and consumables (10%), and only 10%\u201315% is labor. The O&M cost of the \nnew  WWTP  will  be  about  Nu3.5  per  cubic  meter.  The  government  plans  to  increase  water \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\ftariffs 33 and  subsidize  WWTP  O&M  to  ensure  affordability.  A  tariff  plan  has  been  prepared \nshowing increases required to meet the increased O&M of the new WWTP.34\n \n \n19.  While  the  WWTP  will  be  sized  for  14  MLD,  with  provision  for  easy  expansion  in  a \nmodular  fashion  as  sewage  flows  continue  to  grow,  the  aeration  equipment/blowers  will  be \nlimited to the equivalent of 11 MLD\u2014the expected flow by 2016. The reasons for this include the \ncost  of  concrete  structures,  primary  treatment  of  screening  and  de-gritting,  and  the  sludge \nstabilization process for 14 MLD is almost the same as for 11 MLD and is, therefore, a logical \ninvestment,  but  underutilized  aeration  equipment  would  result  in  unnecessary  investment  and \npower  consumption  until  flows  increase  to  14  MLD  several  years  after  the  WWTP  is  built. \nAerators can readily be added as inflow to the plant gradually increases. \n \nThe  bridge  in  Phuentsholing  Municipality  has  been  designed  with  a  central  pier  in  the \n20. \nstream bed.35\n This is a lower cost option than doing it as a full span or as a suspension bridge. \nThere  is  a  minor  risk  of  erosion  or  scour  around  the  pier,  which  will  be  mitigated  by  a  gabion \nbuffer.  The  water  system  rehabilitation  in  SJM  will  include  refurbishing  two  water  intakes, \ntreatment  plants  and  storage  reservoirs,  and  replacement  of  most  of  the  existing  water  trunk \nmains and distribution system, including service connections. The work will be done on existing \nfacilities  and  road  rights-of-way.  Suitable  specifications  for  pipe  materials  and  construction \ntechniques  will  be  used.  O&M  of  the  refurbished  system  will  be  easier  than  for  the  existing \ndamaged system, and the water quality will be improved to potable standards. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic analysis was undertaken for the WSS and mobility outputs of the project. The \n21. \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the base-case scenario varies from 14.0% to 18.5%. \nThe  EIRR  is  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  12.0%.  A \nsensitivity analysis was also undertaken with the following scenarios: (i) capital costs increased \nby  10%,  (ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  10%,  and  (iii)  benefits  reduced  by  10%.  Under  all \nscenarios, the EIRRs remain above 12%. \n \n22. \nThe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for  the  water  supply  and  wastewater \ncomponents  were  calculated  with  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  a  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  is  2.04%  for  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  components;  (ii)  a  25-year  projection \nperiod,  including  a  construction  period  of  5  years;  and  (iii)  constant  2011  prices.  The  FIRR  is \n9.1%  for  the  water  supply  component  and  2.3%  for  the  wastewater  component.  A  sensitivity \nanalysis  was  also  undertaken  with  the following  scenarios:  (i)  capital  costs  increased  by  10%, \n(ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  10%,  (iii)  revenues  reduced  by  10%,  and  (iv)  completion  of \ncomponent  delayed  by  1  year.  The  FIRR  varied  from  \u20130.6%  to  9.1%  for  the  water  supply \ncomponent,  and  from  a  negative  value  to  2.3%  for  the  wastewater  component.36\n Affordability \nanalysis shows suggested tariffs to be less than 5% of household income. \n \n\n                                                \n33 Consumers are currently charged for water and 50% of the water bill is for wastewater treatment. \n34 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ADB is also providing TA to help \n\nmodernize Thimphu Municipality\u2019s financial management and revenue generation. \n\n35 The bridge comprises 46.0 meters (m) effective span, with 6.6 m approach slabs and 10.0 m approach blocks on \neach side. It will also include a new approach road of 90.0 m, and improvement of 200.0 m of associated roads. \n36 The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  a  reduction  of  project  benefits,  particularly  non-implementation  of  required \n\ntariff increases, is the most sensitive risk factor. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nA financial management assessment was undertaken for the executing agency and the \nimplementing agencies. Fiduciary risks were assessed as low at the country level. At the entity \nlevel,  control  risks  for  the  executing  agency  and  three  implementing  agencies,  currently \nimplementing UIDP, were also assessed as low. Adequate training will be provided for the two \nimplementing  agencies  (Nganglam  Town  and  SJM)  lacking  experience  in  ADB-financed \nprojects. In addition, ongoing TA37 is providing support to the Royal Audit Authority of Bhutan to \nincrease the accountability and transparency of public accounts. A governance assessment for \nthe  interim  country  partnership  strategy  is  also  under  preparation.  Its  objective  is  to  formulate \nrisk  assessments  and risk  mitigation  plans for  public financial  management,  procurement,  and \nanticorruption risks at the country level and for the urban and energy sectors. Other than ADB, \nthe  World  Bank  is  providing  assistance  to  two  implementing  agencies38\n to  increase  revenues \nand  improve  financial  management.  Procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  executing  agency \nand implementing agencies. The executing agency and three of the five implementing agencies \nhave experience under the UIDP; and have developed capacity to issue tenders, evaluate bids, \nand  prepare  bid  evaluation  reports.  Newly  formed  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be \ntrained \nthe  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  and  the  design,  monitoring,  and  supervision  consultant.  Further \ncapacity will be built for all implementing agencies through the PMU and involving the executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies  in  annual  in-country  procurement  seminars  of  ADB. \nProcurement  accountability  is  provided  through  the  tender  opening,  tender  evaluation,  and \ntender award committees. Each committee has to make a declaration of no conflict of interest. \nThe three-tier system provides due diligence. All government staff and consultants are subject \nto group and individual audits. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement  (MOWHS),  the \nDepartment of Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES), and the implementing \nagencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nPAM.39\n \n  \nD. \n\ntwinning  arrangements,  providing  on-the-job \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nthrough \n\ntraining \n\nfrom \n\n25. \nThe project supports the government\u2019s poverty reduction program and contributes to the \nachievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goal  7  by  providing  both  the  poor  and  non-poor \ncontinuous  access  to  basic  services  including  safe  drinking  water  and  adequate  sanitation \nfacilities  in  Thimphu  Municipality  and  SJM,  and  improved  urban  environment  through  bypass \nroad  development  in  Phuentsholing  Municipality.  A  health  and  hygiene  awareness  campaign \nunder the project will also enhance public participation and improve the health of poor families \nthrough improved hygiene behavior, as well as provide jobs for those involved in the sanitation \nbusiness  and  services,  the  majority  of  whom  are  from  poorer  households.  The  project  is \ncategorized  \u201ceffective  gender  mainstreaming\u201d  as  it  addresses  specific  gender  issues,  which \ninclude ensuring continuous access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities for \nhouseholds headed by women (49.6% of total households in the project areas). A consultation \nand participation plan and gender action plan have been prepared. The gender action plan will \nbe  implemented  and  monitored  by  the  PMU  in  coordination  with  the  Gender  and  Social \n\n                                                \n37  ADB.  2010.

The project is classified category B for environment. Three \n26. \ninitial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  including  environmental management  plans  (EMPs), \nwere prepared and disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment  laws.  Subprojects  are  not  located  in  or  near  sensitive  or  protected  areas, and  the \nIEEs conclude no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, \nand construction activities. The EMPs provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts \nare  limited  and  of  short  duration.  The  net  environmental  benefits  will  be  positive  and  large, \nincluding  (i)  improved  river  water  quality  from  sewerage  treatment  in  Thimphu  Municipality, \n(ii) improved  air  quality  and  pedestrian  safety  from  road  bypass  and  bridge  works  in \nPhuentsholing  Municipality,  and  (iii)  improved  drinking  water  quality  and  quantity  from  water \nsupply  improvements  in  SJM.  Implementation  arrangements  in  the  PMU  and  PIUs  build  on \nprevious  experience  gained  from  the  UIDP,  and  adequate  capacity  is  ensured  to  manage \nenvironmental  impacts  through  consultant  support  and  additional  capacity  building.  The  IEEs \nand  EMPs  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  as  necessary  and  will  be  incorporated  into \nbidding and contract documents to be implemented by contractors and monitored by the PIUs \nand PMU. Environmental reporting to ADB from the PMU will be done on a semiannual basis. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  planning  studies \nand detailed design of future investments in preparation for possible additional financing.40\n \n \nSocial safeguards. The project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and \n27. \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  designed  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \nresettlement impacts, and social risks. A resettlement framework was prepared and disclosed in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  laws41 to  guide  planning \nstudies and detailed designs of future investments (for possible additional financing not financed \nunder  the  project).42\n Implementation  arrangements  build  on  previous  experience  gained  from \nthe  UIDP,  and  ensure  that  the  PMU  and  PIUs  have  adequate  capacity  to  understand  and \nprepare  resettlement  plans,  if  necessary,  through  consultant  support  and  additional  capacity \nbuilding.  Considering  the  urban  locations  of  these  subprojects,  no  impacts  to  indigenous \npeoples are expected. Meaningful, widespread consultations will continue with all communities \nin the project area during implementation. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.43\n \n \n\n                                                \n40 Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  supplementary  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n41 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Based  on  field  visits  and  discussions  with  the  government,  no  significant  resettlement  impacts  are  envisioned \n\nunder possible future investments. \n\n43 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInsufficient technical capacity to operate WWTP in \nThimphu Municipality \n\nMitigating Measures \nA design\u2013build\u2013operate contract will be used for the \nWWTP to ensure proper O&M after commissioning. \nMonitoring by Thimphu Municipality will ensure the \ncontractor is meeting all O&M parameters, including \npreventive maintenance. \nThimphu Municipality will assure the required increase in \ntariffs in accordance with the tariff plan.
