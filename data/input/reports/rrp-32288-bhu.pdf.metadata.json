Because the project road is the only east-\nwest  link,  the  country  will  benefit  from  accessibility  of  improved\ntransport,  savings  in  road  maintenance  costs,  and  reduction  in\nvehicle operating costs (VOCs).\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary objective: Economic growth\nSecondary objective: Poverty reduction\n\nEnvironmental \nAssessment\n\nCategory B\n\nRationale\n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  and  the\nsummary is a core appendix.\n\nThe  social  and  economic  well-being  of  Bhutan  is  related  to  an\neffective  and  sustainable  road  transport  network  as  no  other\nmodes of transport are available for the movement of people and\ngoods.  The  extreme  geographic  conditions  and  mountainous\nterrain pose challenges to the provision of transport links and to its\nnecessary  maintenance.  The  existing  national  road  network  is  in\nneed  of  improvement  and  protection  as  the  deteriorated  road\nsurface  makes  journeys  longer  and  more  difficult.  Frequent\nlandslides  also  block  the  roads  and  cause  major  delays  in\nmovement by vehicle or on foot. Heavy snow cover in winter also\nhinders  movement.  The  East-West  Highway,  the  project  road,  is\noccasionally  blocked  by  landslides,  sometimes  for  more  than  a\nweek  at  a  time.  Constructed  to  a  single-lane  standard  by  the\nIndian Border Roads Organization during 1965-1985, the highway\nconnects Thimphu in the west to Trashigang in the east. The road\nis  of  strategic  importance  to  Bhutan  since  it  is  the  only  means  of\ntransport between the two important cities. The highway also links\na  number  of  other  urban  centers  along  the  route,  including\nWangdue-Phodrang, Trongsa, Jakar, and Mongar, and acts as the\nonly collector of traffic from the urban centers north and south of\nthe route.\n\nThe  Project  will  address  the  following  aspects  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) sector strategy and policy dialogue: (i)\nintegrate  the  domestic  market;  (ii)  enhance  access  to  local,\nregional,  and  international  markets;  (iii)  increase  employment\nopportunities  and  incomes,  especially  in  rural  areas,  to  reduce\npoverty;  (iv)  stimulate  private  sector  activity,  especially  in  rural\nareas;  (v)  develop  public/private  partnerships \nfor  planning,\nmanaging, and implementing construction and maintenance of the\nnational  road  network;  (vi)  improve  road  safety;  and  (vii)  develop\nthe  domestic  consulting  profession.  The  Road  Planning  and\n\n\fiii\n\nManagement  Strengthening  Project  technical  assistance  (TA),\nwhich  will  be  implemented  concurrently  with  the  Project,  will\nimprove  governance  by  strengthening  the  Department  of  Roads\n(DOR).\n\nindustries  by \n\nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  promote  private  sector\nparticipation and assist in developing the domestic contracting and\nconsulting \nintroducing  a  pilot  contractor  and\nequipment  leasing  scheme;  (ii)  reduce  poverty  by  enhancing\nemployment  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  improving  access  to\nhealth,  education,  and  other  social  services;  and  (iii)  improve\ngovernance by providing institutional support to DOR. The Project\nwill undertake improvements on the East-West Highway, including\nresurfacing,  construction  of  line  drainage,  and  slope  protection\nworks.    Because  the  project  road  is  the  only  east-west  link,  the\ncountry  will  benefit  from  improved  transport  accessibility,  savings\nin road maintenance costs, and reduction in VOCs. The Project\u2019s\nobjectives are consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities for road\nsector  development  under  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY1997-\nFY2002).\n\nthe \n\nThe  Project  will  consist  of \nfollowing  components:  (i)\nresurfacing  of  about  380  kilometers  (km)  on  the  East-West\nHighway,  using  mechanized  techniques  in  an  environmentally\nsound  manner  and  incorporating  all  related  drainage  works;  (ii)\nimproving slope stability to preserve the existing national highway\nnetwork;  (iii)  implementing  a  pilot  contractor  and  equipment\nleasing  scheme  for  domestic  contractors  to  participate  in  the\nProject;  and  (iv)  providing  consulting  services  for  design  and\nsupervision of civil works and for institutional support.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $12.8  million\nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $8.7 million and the local\ncurrency cost is $4.1 million equivalent, or 32 percent of the total\nproject cost.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n($ million)\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\n\nTotal\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\n\n8.7\n0.0\n\n8.7\n\n0.9\n3.2\n\n4.1\n\n9.6\n3.2\n\n12.8\n\n75\n25\n\n100\n\n\fPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2005\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nDepartment of Roads\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms \n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\niv\n\nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR7,310,000  ($9.6\nmillion  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and interest\ncharge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent per annum thereafter.\n\nThe  Project  will  be \nmanagement office within DOR.\n\nimplemented  by  a  separate  project\n\nAll  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  procured  following  local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  among  prequalified  contractors\naccording to the Government\u2019s standard procurement procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB.

The  consultants  will  be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n\n31 December 2004\n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  more  rapid  economic  growth  of\nthe project area by expanding economic opportunities, particularly\nin  agriculture,  cottage  industry,  and  tourism.  Furthermore,  the\nProject  will  improve  the  overall  quality  of  life  of  rural  people  and\nreduce  poverty  by  creating  employment  and  economic\nopportunities  for  the  poor,  and  improving  access  to  schools,\nhealth,  and  other  social  and  government  services.  Road\nimprovement works under the Project will require mostly unskilled\nlabor  and  will  generate  direct  income-earning  opportunities,\nparticularly for the poor and women.\n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  60,000  people.\nAlthough  a  poverty  line  for  Bhutan  is  yet  to  be  established,  the\nfeasibility  report  that  gives  the  poverty  profile  of  the  population\naffected  by  the  Project  shows  that  more  than  one  third  of  the\nProject\u2019s  beneficiaries  are  estimated  to  fall  below  the  poverty\nlevel. The beneficiaries will be (i) the poor who will achieve more\nmobility \nincome-generating\nopportunities; (ii) entrepreneurs and petty traders who will be able\n\nseeking  employment  and \n\nin \n\n\fv\n\nto  set  up  enterprises  along  the  road;  (iii)  agricultural  enterprises\nthat will benefit from faster, cheaper, and reliable access to large\nmarkets  and  export  opportunities;  (iv)  neighboring  countries  that\ncan  utilize  the  route  for  improved  access  to  Thimphu,  thereby\npromoting  regional  cooperation;  (v)  passenger  traffic  along  the\nThimpu - Wangdue-Phodrang \u2013 Bumthang \u2013 Mongar - Trashigang\nroutes,  and  (vi)  exporters  and  importers  who  will  benefit  from\nreduced  transportation  cost  for  freight  using  the  shorter  project\nroute.\n\nImproving the road conditions on the East-West Highway will also\nproduce  road  user  benefits,  such  as  savings  in  VOCs  and  time.\nFor  the  analysis,  road  user  benefits  were  restricted  to  savings  in\nVOCs  arising  from  changes  in  surface  roughness.  Additionally,\nsince  transport  costs  are  relatively  high  and  improvements  offer\nsignificant  transport  cost  savings  that  will  stimulate  the  local\neconomy, there will also be an increase in the quantity and quality\nof  agricultural  production  in  the  project  area,  tourism,  and\nindustrial development. The Project is expected to have a positive\nsocial impact. The documented stakeholder consultations confirm\nwidespread support for the Project.\n\n\fvi\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Road Improvement Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe social and economic well-being of Bhutan is related to an effective and sustainable\nroad transport network as there are no other modes of transport available for the movement of\npeople  and  goods.  The  extreme  geographic  conditions  and  mountainous  terrain  pose\nchallenges  to  the  provision  of  transport  links  and  to  its  necessary  maintenance.  As  the\nGovernment  has  invested  in  the  steady  development  of  the  road  network  and  gradually\nassumed responsibility for its maintenance, the network has remained serviceable but requires\nsignificant investment in periodic and routine maintenance. To enhance the contribution of the\nroad network to the social and economic development in the country, during the 1997 Country\nProgramming  Mission  to  Bhutan,  the  Government  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nfinancing for the Road Improvement Project. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission1 visited Bhutan on\n8-23  March  2000  to  formulate  the  Project  on  the  basis  of  discussions  with  the  Government,\nother  agencies  active  in  the  road  sector,  beneficiaries,  and  the  project  feasibility  report.2  The\nAppraisal Mission completed the review and analysis of all aspects of the Project and the sector\non 21 May-1 June 2000. Loan negotiations with representatives of the Government were held in\nManila on 11-14 August 2000. The project framework is shown in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3.\nBhutan  experienced  modest  growth  in  output  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  1999,  with  real  gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth estimated at 6 percent compared with 5.1 percent per annum\nthe  previous  year.  Agricultural  growth  picked  up  after  a  slowdown  the  year  before.  Currently,\nmajor  hydropower  and  industrial  projects  have  continued  to  expand  construction  activities.\nHigher  industrial  growth,  particularly  in  electricity,  is  expected  after  the  projects  are\ncommissioned. Because of the exchange rate peg with the Indian rupee and the porous border\nwith India, prices in Bhutan can be expected to parallel price development in India. The pegging\narrangement has promoted confidence in the ngultrum along with the free circulation of Indian\nrupees in the country. This arrangement has also facilitated stability in the trade of goods and\nservices  with  India,  which  amounts  to  almost  80  percent  of  total  trade.  Inflation  in  FY1999\nincreased  slightly  beyond  9  percent  from  the  previous  year  due  to  the  rises  in  food  prices  in\nIndia. Money supply growth slowed from the highest of more than 40 percent in FY1998 to 21\npercent  in  FY1999.  This  represents  a  slower  increase  of  net  foreign  assets  from  inflows  of\nforeign  aid  and  continued  decline  in  domestic  credit,  particularly  to  the  Government,  although\ncredit to the private sector slightly increased.\n\n4.\nThe  Government  continues  to  conduct  a  prudent  fiscal  policy,  with  current  revenues\nexceeding  current  expenditures  for  the  past  four  years.  Inflows  of  foreign  grants  were  not\nsufficient  to  cover  development  expenditures,  and  an  overall  budget  deficit  of  2.3  percent  of\nGDP  occurred  in  FY1999,  compared  with  0.9  percent  surplus  in  the  previous  year.  This\napparent  deterioration  in  the  country\u2019s  fiscal  resources  was  due  mainly  to  a  major  increase  in\ncapital expenditures for the hydropower projects. As these investments are all financed by aid\n\n                                                \n1 \n\nThe project processing team comprised M. Minc, Project Economist/Mission Leader; R. Rinker, Project Engineer;\nS. Handayani, Social Development Specialist; and S. Nanwani, Senior Counsel.\nTA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\n\n2 \n\n\f2\n\nfunds  in  concessional  terms,  the  small  fiscal  deficit  represents  no  major  risks  to  the\nmacroeconomic imbalance in the medium term before these projects are commissioned.\n\nA.\n\nThe Road Sector\n\n5.\nFrom a very few kilometers (km) in the 1950s, Bhutan\u2019s road network today has grown to\n3,375  km  of  national  highways,  which  make  up  47  percent  of  the  total  network  (1,586  km).\nDuring Bhutan\u2019s first three development plans (FY1962-FY1976), three north-south roads from\nthe Indian border to the interior of the country were built. An east-west artery from Thimphu to\nTrashigang  was  also  begun  during  that  period  and  completed  in  1985.  The  construction  of\ndistrict  and  feeder  roads  began  during  the  Fourth  Plan  and  has  continued  until  present  times.\nThe Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY1991-FY1996) and the current Eighth Five-Year Plan (FY1997-\nFY2002, however, emphasized upgrading and maintenance of existing road assets rather than\nthe construction of new ones. The continued development of the road network has been driven\nby economic development priorities and by a steady growth in Bhutan\u2019s vehicle fleet and traffic\nvolume. From 700 vehicles in 1980, the fleet has grown to 18,288, of which 43 percent are two-\nwheelers, 41 percent are classified as light vehicles, and 16 percent are heavy vehicles. Traffic\nlevels are highest in the west and much lower in the east and the south. In relative terms, traffic\nlevels in Bhutan remain low. Basic data for the road sector is presented in Appendix 2.\n\nIn the past 30 years, the Indian Border Roads Organization (IBRO) has undertaken the\n6.\nvast majority of the construction and maintenance works on Bhutan\u2019s road network through the\nDANTAK  project.3  Over  the  last  decade,  however,  responsibility  for  the  national  road  network\nhas gradually shifted to the Royal Government of Bhutan. Now, IBRO still maintains 478 km of\nthe  national  highway  system.  It  is  expected  that  the  Government  will  eventually  assume\nresponsibility  for  those  sections  as  well.  The  Government  agency  responsible  for  maintaining\nand managing the national road network is the Department of Roads (DOR) of the Ministry of\nCommunications  (MOC),  originally  created  as  the  Public  Works  Division.  As  the  Government\ninvested  in  the  steady  development  of  the  national  road  network  and  gradually  assumed\nresponsibility for its maintenance, the network has remained serviceable but requires significant\ninvestment in periodic and routine maintenance.\n\n1.\n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\n7.\nThree  bus  operators\u2013  Bhutan  Post,  Dawa  Transport,  and  Leksol  Buses\u2013currently\noperate passenger services along the East-West Highway. Passenger bus fares are regulated\nby MOC through the Road Safety and Transport Authority and reviewed quarterly. The average\nfares these operators charge for a selection of routes tend to be in the range Nu0.35-0.55 per\nkm. For trucks, average freight rates are not regulated and depend on the type of cargo, size,\nand ownership of the operator, availability of back-haul rates, and time of year. Freight rates are\ngenerally  higher  in  the  monsoon  period,  partly  due  to  increased  demand  coinciding  with  the\nharvest  season  for  many  crops  and  partly  due  to  the  increased  likelihood  of  trucks  being\ndelayed  due  to  landslides.  Information  collected  from  operators  from  a  number  of  origins  and\ndestinations  in  Bhutan  indicates  that,  assuming  an  average  payload  of  8  tons,  the  average\nfreight rate is Nu2.5-3.5 per ton-km.\n\n                                                \n3  DANTAK is the IBRO project that constructed the national highways in Bhutan.\n\n\f3\n\n2.\n\nPlanning and Administration\n\n8.\nThe planning process in Bhutan begins with the development of the five-year plan. The\nPlanning Commission is responsible for developing the plan. The Policy and Planning Division\nof MOC prepares a national plan for the transport and human settlement sector in accordance\nwith  planning  guidelines  set  forth  in  the  five-year  plan.  This  plan  also  has  a  five-year  horizon,\nproviding  orientation  to  each  of  the  operating  units  of  MOC  for  the  development  of  its  annual\noperating  plan.  DOR  has  six  operating  entities:  (i)  Roads  Division,  (ii)  Survey  and  Design\nDivision,  (iii)  Bridge  Division,  (iv)  Mechanical  Division,  (v)  Stores  Unit,  and  (vi)  World  Food\nProgram  Coordination.  The  annual  investment  plan  for  the  Roads  Maintenance  Sections  is\ndeveloped  at  the  headquarters  level  from  plans  for  each  section  submitted  by  the  executive\nengineers. The investment plan includes proposed capital investments in road construction and\nperiodic  maintenance,  and  emergency  works  such  as  slope  protection  or  repair  of  damaged\npavement.\n\n3.\n\nBudgeting Process\n\n9.\nAnnual  budgets  for  road  maintenance  include  two  components,  the  investment  budget\nand the routine maintenance budget. The investment budget is prepared by estimating the cost\nof the annual investment plan. The cost of patching potholes, especially when required prior to\nperiodic  maintenance  interventions,  is  included  in  the  investment  budget.  The  proposed\nimprovements in the annual investment plan are prioritized at an annual meeting organized by\nDOR  headquarters,  chaired  by  the  director  of  roads  and  attended  by  senior  staff  representing\nthe  roads  maintenance  sections.  The  projects  selected  are  based  on  expected  budgetary\nallocations  and  on  mutual  agreement  between  the  parties.  Routine  maintenance  budgets  are\nallocated on the basis of the number of kilometers in each maintenance section. In FY1999 the\namounts  allocated  and  spent  were  Nu30,000  ($698)  per  km  for  national  highways,  Nu26,266\n($611) per km for district roads, and Nu11,800 ($274) per km for feeder roads.\n\n10.\nThe  proposed  budget  is  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Accounts  of  the\nMinistry of Finance where, after consideration of expected revenue and budgetary requirements\nfor  all  other  Government  agencies,  a  budgetary  allocation  is  made  to  DOR.  Due  to  budgetary\nconstraints,  the  allocation  is  generally  less  than  the  initial  request.  When  this  happens,\nallocations for routine maintenance are not reduced; rather, the investment plan is adjusted by\nremoving  projects.  During  the  year,  DOR  generally  requests  supplementary  budgetary\nallocations  to  meet  emergency  needs  or  to  fund  priority  road  improvements.  If  the  request  is\napproved and supplementary funds are available, the Ministry of Finance may provide them.\n\n4.\n\nBudget Allocations\n\n11.\nRoad  sector  budgetary  allocations  have  increased  by  an  average  of  23  percent  per\nannum  between  FY1993  and  FY1999.  Funds  allocated  for  resurfacing  works  increased  by  an\naverage of 57 percent per annum over the period, while maintenance expenditure increased by\nonly  12  percent  per  annum.  Future  plans  for  road  sector  expenditure  as  laid  out  in  the  Eighth\nFive-Year  Plan  for  Bhutan  allocates  about  Nu3.0  billion  to  the  roads  sector  over  the  five-year\nplanning period. This represents a significant increase in the level of funding to the sector and\nconfirms the overall government objective to concentrate expenditure on social sectors including\nhealth and education, and transport.\n\n\f4\n\n5.\n\nUser Charges and Expenditures\n\n12.\nThe Government levies a range of user taxes and fees on the road transport sector.  The\nmain taxes are the fuel sales tax, motor vehicle taxes, retail sales taxes of vehicle components,\nimport  duties,  and  weighbridge  fees.  The  total  revenues  collected  have  increased  sharply  in\nrecent years, mainly the result of increased revenue from the sales tax on petroleum products.\nExpenditures  have  far  outweighed  the  revenues  collected  within  the  sector.  In  FY1998,  road\nsector revenues accounted for only 25 percent of total government expenditure on road sector\nactivities.  However,  there  is  clearly  potential  for  increasing  the  revenues  collected  from  road\nusers.  Appropriate  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  Bhutan  will  be  assessed  during  the\nimplementation  of  the  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)4  for  the  Road  Planning  and\nManagement Strengthening Project.\n\n6.\n\nRegulatory Framework\n\n13.\nOver the years, the Government has addressed important legal issues affecting the road\nsector and transport industry through the various acts, rules, regulations, and guidelines issued\nby  various  government  agencies:  (i)  the  Rules  and  Regulations  for  construction  of  temporary,\nsemipermanent, and permanent houses on either side of a road issued by the Ministry of Home\nAffairs  in  1993;  (ii)  the  Road  Safety  and  Transport  Act  1999  issued  by  MOC;  (iii)  the  Field\nManual  of  Road  Maintenance  issued  by  DOR  in  1989;  (iv)  the  bioengineering  techniques  for\nslope  protection  and  stabilization  issued  by  DOR  in  1999;  (v)  the  Environmental  Code  of\nPractices for Highways and Roads issued by DOR in September 1999; (vi) the Municipal Act of\n1999  issued  by  MOC;  (vii)  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Management  Act  1995  issued  by  the\nDepartment of Geology; (viii) the Land Act (second edition 1998) issued by the Ministry of Home\nAffairs;  and  (ix)  the  environmental  guidelines  on  roads  and  highways  issued  by  the  National\nEnvironment Commission in 1999.\n\nA  review  of  the  many  interrelated  legislation  reveals  no  coordinated  and  focused\n14.\napproach through a single piece of legislation covering roads and road transport in the country.\nAlso, the agencies responsible for particular sectors are primarily concerned with safeguarding\ntheir respective interests, resulting in conflicting rules and regulations. Further, the enforcement\nmechanisms  are  varied  and  uncoordinated.  The  Government  recognizes  that  coordinated\nlegislation is needed, as the national road network is the predominant means of transport within\nthe country and as the number of road users and vehicles is increasing. Also, there needs to be\na clear delineation of authority and responsibility for enforcement.\n\n7.\n\nProposed Road Act\n\n15.\nThe Government has expressed its concern about the need for coordinated legislation to\ncover  roads  and  road  transport  in  the  country.  The  TA  will  take  into  account  the  existing\nlegislation  on  road-related  matters,  and  prepare  draft  legislation  for  the  proposed  Road  Act,\ntaking  into  account  the  views  of  the  Government,  local  communities,  nongovernment\norganizations,  and  other  stakeholders,  including  road  users  (vehicle  owners,  users  of  public\ntransportation, and freight transport users). The proposed draft legislation will (i) clearly define\nthe  responsibilities  and  rights  of  the  provider  (the  Government),  road  users,  and  affected\ncommunities;  (ii)  address  the  construction,  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and  use  of  the  road,\nwhile  safeguarding  or  mitigating  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  users  and  the\ncommunity  at  large;  (iii)  spell  out  the  compensation  to  be  paid  in  the  acquisition  of  land,\n\n                                                \n4 \n\nTA 3470-BHU: Road Planning and Management Strengthening Project, for $954,000, approved on 20 July 2000.\n\n\f5\n\nincluding  right-of-way,  for  road  construction  in  accordance  with  existing  legislation;  (iv)\ndetermine the feasibility of levying user charges to recover the cost of maintaining the national\nroad network; (v) specify the agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing the provisions of\nthe legislation; and (vi) prescribe the penalties for any statutory violation. The Government will\nuse  the  draft  legislation  prepared  under  the  TA  as  a  basis  for  enacting  the  Road  Act.  Within\nthree  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  (i)  consult  with  ADB  on  any  major\nchanges  made  to  the  draft  Road  Act  before  presenting  it  to  the  Cabinet  and  the  National\nAssembly; and (ii) enact and make effective the proposed Road Act.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n16.\nIn  its  five-year  plans,  the  Government  has  given  priority  to  investments  in  essential\ninfrastructure, providing better access to basic services, improving the quality of life in the rural\nareas,  supporting  community  participation  in  development  activities,  and  promoting  private\nsector  involvement  in  project  implementation.  The  main  objectives  of  the  current  Eighth  Five-\nYear  Plan  are  to  develop  a  regionally  balanced  network  that  is  safe,  convenient,  and\neconomical  to  use;  preserve  the  past  capital  investment  in  roads;  reduce  the  cost  of  vehicle\noperation  and  travel  time  of  road  users;  and  develop  road  construction  and  maintenance\ncapabilities  in  the  private  sector.  The  main  strategies  include  (i)  developing  guidelines  and\npractices  for  road  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  that  cause  minimum  adverse  impact\non  the  environment;  (ii)  promoting  larger  private  sector  role  in  road  construction  and\nmaintenance through contracting; (iii) developing a long-term comprehensive road master plan;\n(iv)  developing  a  suitable  road  maintenance  management  system;  (v)  improving  maintenance\nsystems  for  rural  roads;  (vi)  improving  geometric  features  of  roads  to  reduce  accidents;  (vii)\nto  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs);  (viii)\ntimely  resurfacing  of  existing  roads \nstrengthening  institutional  capacity  through  further  training;  and  (ix)  utilizing  locally  available\nmaterials and resources whenever possible.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n17.\nThe main source of external financing for roads in Bhutan has been the Government of\nIndia. Since 1959, India has provided assistance through the DANTAK for the construction and\nmaintenance  of  the  main  road  network  in  Bhutan.  The  United  Nations  Capital  Development\nFund  has  completed  three  projects  for  rural  road  development  in  the  eastern  region.  The\nGovernment of Japan is supporting a bridge replacement program mainly along the East-West\nHighway. Helvetas of Switzerland is providing assistance to replace one bridge, also along the\nEast-West  Highway.  The  World  Bank  recently  approved  the  Rural  Access  Project  for  $11.6\nmillion  for  the  construction  of  feeder  roads  in  Zhemgang,  Lhuentse,  and  Trashi  Yangtse,  and\nTrashigang  Dzongkhag.5  It  is  important  to  note  that  all  external  interventions  in  the  sector  are\ncomplementary and rely on each other for justification of the overall investments. Details of the\nexternal assistance to the road sector are in Appendix 3.\n\n18.\nADB has been providing support to the road sector in Bhutan since 1983. It began with\nthe  Multiproject6  that  focused  on  infrastructure  works.  The  Roadworks  Mechanization  Project7\nwas a loan program designed to increase productivity through the development of mechanized\nthe  East-West  Highway\nconstruction  and  maintenance \n\ntechniques.  The  most  recent, \n\n                                                \n5  A dzongkhag is a district.\n\n6\n7 \n\nLoan 637-BHU(SF): Multiproject, for $5.0 million, approved on 22 September 1983.\nLoan 790-BHU(SF): Roadworks Mechanization Project, for $4.5 million, approved on 30 September 1986.\n\n\f6\n\nMaintenance Project,8 was intended to cover the resurfacing of the highway and to support the\ndevelopment of a private sector contracting industry in Bhutan. Throughout these loan periods,\nADB also funded nine TA projects in the sector for project preparation and for the institutional\nstrengthening  of  DOR.  Those  projects  were  designed  in  part  to  improve  the  capacity  of  the\nGovernment and the private sector, as responsibility for the roads continues to be shifted from\nIBRO.  Most  recently  an  ADB-funded  TA9  resulted  in  a  complete  overhaul  of  the  construction\ncontracting procurement process, including road works. The new framework has been included\nin  the  Government\u2019s  Financial  Manual  and  will  bring  the  process  in  Bhutan  closer  to\ninternational standards.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe Multiproject (footnote 6) was completed and a project performance audit report was\n19.\nprepared.  The  report  found  that  greater  efforts  to  familiarize  the  executing  agencies  with  ADB\nprocedures  and  practices  would  have  minimized  implementation  delays,  and  that  training\nprograms  for  the  DOR  engineers  needed  to  be  developed.  The  Roadworks  Mechanization\nProject  (footnote  7)  was  aimed  at  increasing  DOR\u2019s  productivity  in  road  construction  and\nmaintenance  by  providing  equipment  and  workshop  facilities,  and  training  DOR  staff  in\nmechanized road construction operation and equipment maintenance. With ADB approval, the\nequipment procured under the loan was subsequently sold to the private sector in line with the\nGovernment\u2019s policy of privatization.\n\n20.\nThe  East-West  Highway  Maintenance  Project  (footnote  8)  encountered  problems  with\nthe introduction of a bituminous surface treatment technique new to Bhutan, and with the start-\nup  and  equipping  of  five  inexperienced  contractors.  During  the  resulting  delay  of  almost  three\nyears,  the  road  continued  to  deteriorate,  so  much  so  that  the  improvements  proposed  during\nproject  preparation  became  inadequate  and  obsolete.  Construction  supervision  for  the  project\nwas  provided  under  an  ADB  TA10  grant  requested  by  the  Government.  Timing  problems\noccurred  in  the  fielding  of  the  consultants  recruited  by  ADB,  mainly  due  to  the  start-up  of  the\ninexperienced  contractors.  A  road  management  maintenance  system  (RMMS)  was  also\ndeveloped under an associated TA.11 The RMMS component was not successful because the\nproposed system was inappropriate in the light of the institutional capacity of DOR at that time.\nHowever,  the  resulting  program  of  periodic  maintenance  on  roughly  half  the  project  road\narrested the rapid deterioration taking place. The project also facilitated the establishment of a\nprivatized roads construction industry.\n\nThese  lessons  were  incorporated  during  project  preparation  in  the  feasibility  study.\n21.\nBecause detailed design of the Project will be undertaken immediately prior to the tendering and\naward  of  construction  contracts,  very  little  road  deterioration  will  occur  between  design  and\nconstruction.  Also,  the  minimum  resurfacing  intervention  proposed  for  the  Project  is  a  double\nbituminous  surface  treatment  (DBST),  which  is  twice  the  pavement  coverage  of  the  single\nbituminous  surface  treatment  originally  specified  in  the  previous  project.  Therefore,  the  cost\nestimates  developed  should  closely  represent  final  construction  costs.  Additionally,  design\ninterventions  for  the  Project  include  improvement  of  roadside  drainage  and  slope  protection\n\n                                                \n8 \n\n9\n\nLoan  1265-BHU(SF):  East-West Highway Maintenance Project,  for  $5.2  million,  approved  on  18  November\n1993.\nTA  2802-BHU:  Improvement  of  a  Regulatory  Framework  for  Procurement  and  Contracting,  for  $400,000,\napproved on 23 May 1997.\n\n10  TA 1985-BHU: Construction Management, for $740,000, approved on 18 November 1993.\n11  TA 1984-BHU: Development of a Maintenance Management System, for $390,000, approved on 18 November\n\n1993.\n\n\f7\n\nworks.  Consulting  services  for  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  by  a  team  of  international  and\ndomestic consultants and will provide design, construction supervision, and institutional support\nto  the  project  management  office  (PMO).  The  consultants  will  also  provide  several  training\nworkshops for DOR personnel. The PMO will provide counterpart staff to monitor construction\nactivities and concur with the consultants regarding project progress and quantity certifications;\nthe  arrangement  will  present  an  excellent  opportunity  for  technology  transfer.  Consulting\nservices  will  be  fully  funded  out  of  the  loan  proceeds,  thus  enhancing  the  Government\u2019s\nownership of the Project. Details of the design approach and technical standards are presented\nin Appendix 4.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nTo translate ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction into a strategy and operational\n22.\nprogram,  it  is  necessary  to  reflect  the  reality  of  Bhutan\u2019s  development  context,  considering  (i)\nthe  nature  and  degree  of  poverty;  (ii)  the  effectiveness  of  the  Government\u2019s  economic  and\nsocial  development  programs  in  addressing  basic  human  needs;  (iii)  the  country\u2019s  access  to\ngrant funds from India, other bilateral sources, and the United Nations; (iv) the country\u2019s debt-\nservicing  and  project  implementation  capacities;  and  (v)  the  likely  initiatives  of  other  aid\nagencies.  Reducing  poverty  requires  continued  economic  growth.  ADB  is  well  positioned  to\nsupport  poverty  reduction  by  promoting  economic  growth  and  social  inclusiveness,  through\ninterventions  in  physical  and  social  infrastructure,  private  sector  development,  employment\ncreation,  and  improved  economic  management.  Given  the  Government\u2019s  determination  to  see\nthe  private  sector  play  the  main  role  in  the  future  growth  of  incomes  and  employment\nopportunities, ADB addresses the following areas: (i) strengthening the capacity of government\nagencies,  (ii)  improving  the  physical  and  social  infrastructure,  (iii)  promoting  private  sector\ndevelopment, (iv) improving the efficiency of public service delivery and cost recovery, and (v)\nprotecting the environment.\n\nADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  road  sector  is  consistent  with  the  overall  areas  of  emphasis  and\n23.\nwith  the  objectives  of  the  current  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan.  The  strategic  objective  is  to  improve\nroad  maintenance  to  (i)  integrate  the  domestic  market;  (ii)  enhance  access  to  local,  regional,\nand  international  markets;  (iii)  increase  employment  opportunities  and  incomes,  especially  in\nrural areas, to reduce poverty; (iv) stimulate private sector activity, especially in rural areas; and\n(v)  develop  public/private  partnerships  for  planning,  managing,  and  implementing  construction\nand  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network.  Those  issues  will  be  addressed  during\nimplementation of the Project and the TA. The TA will also assist in improving the planning of\nnew  investments  and  management  of  the  existing  national  road  network,  recommending\nefficient  budget  allocations  for  road  expenditures,  and  contributing  to  the  institutional\nstrengthening of DOR. The TA will also assist the Government in drafting and enacting a Road\nAct (para. 15). In summary, ADB\u2019s sector strategy aims at maximizing the sustainability of the\nroad  sector  in  Bhutan  through    (i)  capacity  building  and  clearly  defining  the  responsibility  of\nDOR, (ii) introducing simple planning procedures for maintenance and improvement works, (iii)\ndevising  adequate  cost  recovery  mechanisms,  and  (iv)  contracting  out  maintenance  works  to\nthe private sector.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n24.\nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government in the road sector has concentrated on the\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  DOR  to  enable  it  to  take  over  from  IBRO  the  responsibility  for\nplanning and managing the national road network. Under the East-West Highway Maintenance\nProject  (footnote  8),  emphasis  was  given  to  (i)  improving  governance  by  institutional\n\n\f8\n\nstrengthening;  (ii)  allocating  funds  for  road  maintenance  operations  more  efficiently;  (iii)\ndeveloping the domestic road construction industry; (iv) establishing a framework for contracting\nroadworks; and (v) improving cost recovery in the road sector through appropriate user charges.\nThe  Project  and  the  TA  will  continue  to  address  the  above  policy  areas,  and  will  improve\ngovernance by strengthening DOR to (i) develop a Road Sector Master Plan with an upgraded\nroad planning and management system, to facilitate efficient budget allocations for road sector\ndevelopment  and  maintenance  activities;  (ii)  introduce  a  more  participatory  approach  for  the\nbeneficiaries  in  planning  and  implementation  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction;  (iii)  improve\nroad safety; (iv) develop the domestic consulting profession; and (v) assist the Government in\ndrafting and enacting a Road Act.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n25.\nThe social and economic well-being of Bhutan is related to an effective and sustainable\nroad transport network as no other mode of transport is available for the movement of people\nand goods. The extreme geographic conditions and mountainous terrain pose challenges to the\nprovision  of  transport  links  and  to  its  necessary  maintenance.  The  existing  national  road\nnetwork  is  in  need  of  improvement  and  protection  as  the  deteriorated  road  surface  makes\njourneys  longer  and  more  difficult.  Frequent  landslides  also  block  the  roads\u2014sometimes  for\nmore than a week at a time\u2014causing major delays in movement by vehicle or on foot. Heavy\nsnow  cover  in  winter  also  hinders  movement.  The  East-West  Highway,  the  project  road,  was\nconstructed  to  a  single-lane  standard  by  IBRO  during  1965-1985.  It  connects  Thimphu  in  the\nwest  and  Trashigang  in  the  east.  The  road  is  of  strategic  importance  to  Bhutan  since  it  is  the\nonly means of transport between those two important towns. The highway also links a number\nof  other  urban  centers  along  the  route  including  Wangdue-Phodrang,  Trongsa,  Jakar,  and\nMongar  and  acts  as  the  only  collector  of  traffic  from  the  urban  centers  north  and  south  of  the\nroute.\n\n26.\nThe  Project  will  address  the  following  aspects  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  and  policy\ndialogue:  (i)  integrate  the  domestic  market;  (ii)  enhance  access  to  local,  regional,  and\ninternational  markets;  (iii)  increase  employment  opportunities  and  incomes,  especially  in  rural\nareas,  to  reduce  poverty;  (iv)  stimulate  private  sector  activity,  especially  in  rural  areas;  (v)\ndevelop public/private partnerships for planning, managing, and implementing construction and\nmaintenance  of  the  national  road  network;  (vi)  improve  road  safety;  and  (vii)  develop  the\ndomestic  consulting  profession.    The  TA,  which  will  be  implemented  concurrently  with  the\nProject, will improve governance by strengthening DOR.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n27.\nThe objectives are to (i) promote private sector participation and assist in developing the\ndomestic contracting and consulting industries by introducing a pilot contractor and equipment\nleasing  scheme;  (ii)  reduce  poverty  by  enhancing  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  and\nimproving access to health, education, and other social services; and (iii) improve governance\nby providing institutional support to DOR. The Project will undertake improvements on the East-\nWest Highway, including resurfacing, construction of line drainage, and slope protection works.\nBecause  the  project  road  is  the  only  east-west  link,  the  country  will  benefit  from  improved\ntransport accessibility, savings in road maintenance costs, and reduction in VOCs. The Project\u2019s\nobjectives are consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities for road sector development under the\nEighth Five-Year Plan.\n\n\f9\n\n28.\nThe Project will consist of the following components: (i) resurfacing about 380 km on the\nEast-West  Highway,  using  mechanized  techniques  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner  and\nincorporating  all  related  drainage  works;  (ii)  improving  slope  stability  to  preserve  the  existing\nnational  highway  network;  (iii)  implementing  a  pilot  contractor  and  equipment  leasing  scheme\nfor  domestic  contractors  to  participate  in  the  Project;  and  (iv)  providing  consulting  services  for\ndesign and supervision of civil works and for institutional support.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n29.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $12.8 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is estimated at $8.7 million representing 68 percent of the total cost and the local\ncurrency cost is estimated at $4.1 million equivalent representing 32 percent of total cost. The\ncost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.\n\nItem\n\nA. Base Costa\n    1. Civil Works\n    2. Equipment\n    3.

The provision for financing\nof  local  currency  costs  is  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency  financing  policy.12  The  loan  will\nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1 percent\n\n                                                \n12  R-1-95, Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January 1995.\n\n\f10\n\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.

DOR,\nwhich  is  headed  by  a  director  under  MOC,  is  responsible  for  design,  construction,  and\nmaintenance  of  roads  and  bridges.  A  PMO  was  established  within  DOR  before  loan\nnegotiations.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating,  implementing,  and  monitoring  the\nProject.  A  full-time  project  manager  heads  the  PMO  and  is  supported  by  adequate  and\ncompetent technical and administrative personnel. The project manager will be delegated with\nsufficient  authority  to  permit  effective  decision  making  on  project  implementation  matters.  The\norganization chart of the  PMO is presented in Appendix 6. The Government will provide DOR\nwith adequate budgetary allocations for timely implementation of the Project. DOR has gained\nadequate  experience  in  project  implementation  through  the  previous  ADB  road  projects  in  the\ncountry.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n32.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  about  four  years.  Civil  works  are\nexpected  to  commence  around  June  2001  and  be  completed  by  the  end  of  December  2004.\nBecause of the harsh winter and monsoon rains in the summer, the work seasons in the project\narea  are  limited.  This  schedule  assumes  the  consultant  is  mobilized  by  January  2001.  The\ntentative implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7.\n\n2. \n\nProcurement\n\n33.\nAll  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All civil works, the largest having a value of $1.5 million, will\nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  according  to  the  Government\u2019s\nstandard  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  civil  works  contractors  will  be\nprequalified.  As  the  contracts  are  relatively  small,  they  are  unlikely  to  attract  significant\ninternational interest. All bidding documents will include clauses to reflect ADB\u2019s policy on anti-\n\n\f11\n\ncorruption.  The  bidding  documents  will  also  include  provisions  on  environmental  protection,\nchild labor, and prevention of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.13\n\n34.\nThe  use  of  local  competitive  bidding  for  these  contracts  will  provide  an  opportunity  to\nstrengthen the emerging domestic contracting industry whose development was initiated in part\nthrough the East-West Highway Maintenance Project (footnote 8). The proposed pilot contractor\nscheme,  with  small  contracts  for  periodic  maintenance  and  slope  stability  improvements,\nenables  contractors  with  less  experience  in  road  works  to  participate  in  the  Project,  thus\nexpanding the local construction industry\u2019s capability to carry out road improvement works.\n\n35.\nEquipment  or  materials  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  by\ninternational  shopping  procedures,  except  that  equipment  or  materials  estimated  at  less  than\n$100,000  equivalent  per  item  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase.  Under  the  Project  a\ncontract  package  for  road  improvement  equipment  for  the  Mechanical  Division,  estimated  at\n$400,000  equivalent,  will  be  awarded  through  international  shopping  procedures.  Also,\nmaterials  testing  equipment,  estimated  at  $40,000  equivalent,  will  be  procured  by  direct\npurchase. Indicative procurement packages are presented in Appendix 8.\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\nDetailed design, construction supervision, and institutional support for the Project will be\n36.\nprovided  by  an  international  consulting  firm  which  will  collaborate  with  domestic  consultants.\nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  DOR  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. Staffing inputs will be about 37 person-months for international consultants and 326\nfor  domestic  consultants.  The  consulting  services  will  include  components  to  assist  DOR  in\nstrengthening  its  capacity  in  (i)  road  construction  and  maintenance,  (ii)  contract  procurement\nand  administration,  (iii)  slope  protection  practices,  and  (iv)  road  safety  measures.  Due  to  the\nlimited availability of domestic consultants from the private sector, the international consultants\nmay  be  required  to  draw  from  DOR  suitable  staff  to  assist  in  project  implementation.  The\nGovernment  will  ensure  that  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  are  made  for  release  of  DOR\nstaff  to  participate  in  the  Project,  as  domestic  consultants  independent  of  DOR,  together  with\ndomestic  consultants  from  the  private  sector.  The  overall  period  of  service  will  be  about  48\nmonths.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  for  design,  supervision,  and\ninstitutional support are in Appendix 9.\n\nTo expedite the civil works and make optimum use of suitable construction weather, the\n37.\nGovernment has obtained ADB approval of advance action on recruitment of consultants. The\nGovernment has been informed that the advance action does not commit ADB to approve the\nsubsequent  Project.  The  consultants  are  expected  to  commence  work  in  January  2001.  DOR\nissued invitations for proposals in August 2000.\n\n4.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nThe  Project  does  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  as  the  works  to  be\n38.\nundertaken  will  be  confined  to  resurfacing  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  The  rules  and\nregulations  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs14  specifies  that  no  one  will  be  permitted  to\nconstruct or erect or install any kind of house or fence within 50 feet on either side of the road.\n\n                                                \n13  Human-immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n14 Rules and Regulations for Construction of Semi-Permanent and Permanent Houses on Either Side of the Roads.\n\n\f12\n\nThe  walkover  survey  along  the  project  road  found  no  squatters  within  the  right-of-way.  Since\nthere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  this  Project,  no  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement plan is needed.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursements\n\n39.\nLoan  disbursements  for  the  consulting  services  contract  to  be  procured  through\ninternational selection will be by direct payment procedures. Disbursements for the civil works\ncontract  packages  and  for  incremental  expenditures  will  be  through  imprest  account\nprocedures.  The  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  account  at  the  Bank  of  Bhutan.  The\nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook  dated  June  1996,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and\ndetailed  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited\nwill be based on the estimated expenditures over six months.\n\n6.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n40.\nThe Government and ADB will conduct regular reviews during project implementation. In\naddition, they will jointly carry out a midterm review of the Project during the second year of civil\nworks implementation. The results of the midterm review will be discussed by the parties and, if\nrequired,  appropriate  corrective  measures  will  be  carried  out  to  ensure  successful  project\nimplementation and achievement of the objectives.\n\n7.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\n41.\nThe supervision consultant will prepare brief monthly progress reports to be submitted to\nthe Ministries of Finance and Communications, DOR, and ADB. The reports will provide details\nof the Project, including events or activities not progressing satisfactorily, and remedial actions\nrecommended by the consultants and DOR to resolve problems. The format of the reports will\nbe agreed upon during contract negotiations for consulting services. DOR will also prepare and\nsubmit quarterly progress reports to ADB. Once the works are complete, DOR will arrange for\nthe  consultants  to  prepare  and  submit  a  project  completion  report  within  three  months  of\nphysical completion of the Project.\n\n8.\n\nRecords, Accounts, and Audit\n\nDOR will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to (i) identify the goods and\n42.\nservices financed from the loan proceeds and from counterpart funding; (ii) identify the use of\nthese  goods  and  services  to  the  Project;  (iii)  record  the  progress  of  the  Project,  including  its\ncost;  and  (iv)  reflect,  in  accordance  with  consistently  maintained  sound  accounting  principles,\nthe  Project\u2019s  operational  and  financial  condition.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial\nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  reports  and\nrelated financial statements, to be prepared in English, will be submitted to ADB not later than\nnine months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n 9.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring System\n\n43.\nDuring  project  implementation,  DOR,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  carry\nout  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  activities  under  arrangements  satisfactory\nto ADB to ensure efficient management of project activities and maximization of project benefits.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  performance  indicators  (Appendix  10)  for\n\n\f13\n\ncarrying  out  these  PPMS  activities.  The  findings  and  supporting  data  will  be  incorporated  into\nthe project performance monitoring and evaluation report for the completed Project. Community-\nbased organizations in the geog,15 in association with the DOR, will verify the effectiveness of\nproject activities and outputs, as well as the reactions of the intended beneficiaries. A sociologist\non the consulting team will assist DOR with that task. The project performance and monitoring\nevaluation  will  allow  postevaluation  of  the  Project,  and  also  improve  planning  for  future  road\nimprovement projects.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nfor \n\nthe  project \n\nConsultants \n\nfeasibility  study  conducted  an \n\ninitial  environmental\n44.\nexamination  (IEE)  of  the  Project,  following  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected\nInfrastructure Projects (Highways and Roads). The summary IEE is presented in Appendix 11.\nThe IEE indicated no significant environmental problems associated with the Project, which will\ninvolve only improvements consisting of periodic maintenance of existing roads, line drainage,\nand  slope  protection  works  along  the  existing  alignments.  The  Project  will  reduce  the\nenvironmental  impact  of  the  without-project  scenario,  especially  in  relation  to  siting  and\noperation  of  quarries,  slope  failure  caused  by  inadequate  drainage,  and  use  of  firewood  for\nheating bitumen. DOR will ensure that the environmental impacts of the Project are minimized\nby carrying out the recommendations specified in the IEE and as agreed upon with ADB. The\nProject includes the following enhancement measures:\n\n(i)  Slope stabilization. For continuous access, slope stabilization is the most important\nenhancement measure. Pavement and drainage works are only part of the answer\nto  ensuring  continued  road  operation.  Additional  and  improved  slope  stabilization\nworks  are  required  in  many  areas.  Implementing  an  appropriate  slope-related\nprogram will maximize the effectiveness of the funds available to DOR. A 13-point\naction  plan  covering  a  range  of  slope  stability  issues,  in  order  of  priority,  is\nis  strongly\npresented \nrecommended that DOR consider more extensive use of bioengineering measures.\n\nthe  Slope  Stabilization  Manual.16 \n\nIn  addition, \n\nin \n\nit \n\n(ii)  Water management. The Project offers an opportunity to assist some communities\nwith  irrigation  water  supply  and  to  solve  problems  of  uncontrolled  irrigation  water\ndisposal.  The Project will assist both the Ministry of Agriculture and DOR to install\ndual-purpose roadside water management structures where needed.\n\n(iii)  Road  safety.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  improve  road  safety  by\n\nincorporating various engineering measures in the program of works.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Measures\n\n45.\nAs part of project preparation, a social assessment was carried out using participatory as\nwell as survey methodologies in the project area. The assessment consisted of socioeconomic\nsurveys, and focus group discussions with key stakeholders such as the Planning Commission\nSecretariat  and  the  Health  and  Education  ministries,  government  officials  in  the  dzongkhag\n(footnote 5) social sector administrators in nine dzongkhag in the project area, Road Safety and\n\n                                                \n15  A geog is a cluster of villages.\n16  The Slope Stabilization Manual was prepared under TA 3107-BHU (footnote 2).\n\n\f14\n\nTransport  Authority,  Bhutan  Development  and  Finance  Corporation,  Royal  Bhutan  Women\nAssociation, and Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During the Fact-Finding Mission,\nrapid rural appraisal was conducted for road workers and beneficiaries in several project areas\nto assess the potential employment opportunity as well as beneficiaries\u2019 needs and constraints.\n\n46.\nThe Project is expected to have a positive social impact. The documented stakeholder\nconsultations  confirm  widespread  support  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  more\nrapid economic growth of the project area by expanding economic opportunities, particularly in\nagriculture,  cottage  industry,  and  tourism.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  improve  the  overall\nquality of life for rural people and reduce poverty by creating employment opportunities for the\npoor  through  project  construction  and  maintenance  activities;  and  improving  access  to\neconomic  and  social  opportunities,  schools,  health  services,  and  other  social  as  well  as\ngovernment services. Construction and maintenance works under the Project will require mostly\nunskilled  labor  and  will  generate  direct  income-earning  opportunities,  particularly  for  the  poor\nand women.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nImproving the road conditions on the East-West Highway will produce mainly road user\n47.\nbenefits,  such  as  savings  in  VOCs  and  travel  time.  For  the  analysis,  road  user  benefits  were\nrestricted  to  savings  in  VOCs  arising  from  changes  in  surface  roughness.  Additionally,  since\ntransport  costs  are  relatively  high  and  improvements  offer  significant  transport  cost  savings,\nwhich will stimulate the local economy, there will also be development benefits that include an\nincrease  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of  agricultural  production  in  the  project  area,  tourism,  and\nsmall-scale  industrial  development.  These  benefits  can  be  measured  in  terms  of  net  value  of\ngenerated  output  directly  attributable  to  road  rehabilitation  or  in  terms  of  the  transport  cost\nbenefits  accruing  generated  traffic.17  However,  it  is  essential  that  the  two  approaches  be\npursued  separately  to  avoid  double  counting.  The  methodology  concentrated  on  road  user\nbenefits and adopted the approach of measuring economic development benefits in terms of the\nbenefits gained by generated traffic.\n\n48.\nEconomic evaluation was carried out by comparing the costs and benefits for the with-\nand  without-project  scenarios.  Benefits  based  on  VOC  savings,  in  economic  prices,  were\ncalculated  for  normal  and  generated  traffic.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  road\nimprovement  and  maintenance  costs  to  calculate  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).\nBenefit  streams  were  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years  starting  in  2001.  Costs  and  benefits\nwere estimated net of duties and taxes, and were expressed in constant end-1999 prices. The\nbase EIRR for the Project is 32 percent.\n\n49.\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRRs  to  changes  in  the  underlying  cost  and  benefit  parameters\nwas analyzed. The results show that the adverse assumption of a 15 percent increase in project\ncost would decrease the EIRR to 27 percent. If benefits materialized to only 85 percent of the\noriginal  estimates,  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  27  percent.  In  a  more  adverse  situation  of  a\nsimultaneous increase in project cost by 15 percent and a reduction of benefits by 15 percent,\n\n                                                \n17  As  mentioned  in  para.  7,  freight  rates  are  determined  by  the  market  and  passenger  fares  are  regulated  but\nperiodically  reviewed.  During  the  economic  evaluation,  the  estimated  VOCs  showed  similarities  with  the  rates\nand fares actually charged in the market. This increases the confidence that VOC savings will be passed on to\nthe users.\n\n\f15\n\nthe overall EIRR will be 22 percent.  The switching value18 for cost was determined to be 100\npercent, and switching value for benefits 49 percent. If project implementation is delayed by two\nyears,  the  EIRR  will  be  reduced  to  20  percent.  Also,  if  only  benefits  due  to  VOC  savings  of\nnormal traffic are considered, the EIRR will decrease to 25 percent. The economic analysis is\ngiven in Appendix 12.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\nThe  social  impact  assessment  (Appendix  13)  served  to  inform  the  communities  about\n50.\nthe  Project  and  its  implications,  and  elicited  their  suggestions,  views  on  mitigation  measures,\nand  the  role  they  could  play.  The  local  community,  particularly  the  poor,  will  be  informed  and\nencouraged  to  engage  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  activities.  It  is  important  to\nmaximize  the  participation  of  the  local  community  in  road  construction,  slope  protection,  and\nmaintenance activities.\n\n1.\n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n51.\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  60,000  people.  Based  on  the  feasibility\nreport on the poverty profile of the population affected by the Project, 38 percent of households\nare below the estimated poverty line level of Bhutan.19 The beneficiaries of the Project will be (i)\nthe  poor  who  will  achieve  more  mobility  in  seeking  employment  and  income-generating\nopportunities; (ii) entrepreneurs and small traders who will be able to set up enterprises along\nthe road; (iii) agricultural enterprises that will benefit from faster, cheaper, and reliable access to\nlarge  markets  and  export  opportunities;  (iv)  neighboring  countries  that  can  utilize  the  route  for\nimproved  access  to  Thimphu,  thereby  promoting  regional  cooperation;  (v)  passenger  traffic\nalong \n(vi)\nexporters  and  importers  who  will  benefit  from  reduced  transportation  cost  for  freight  using  the\nshorter  project  route.  Road  construction  and  slope  protection,  which  requires  mostly  unskilled\nlabor,  will  generate  direct  income-earning  opportunities,  particularly  for  the  poor.  Over  four\nyears,  the  Project  will  provide  approximately  300,000  person-days  of  unskilled  employment\nopportunities, particularly for the poor and women.\n\nthe  Thimphu-Wangdue  Phodrang-Bumthang-Mongar-Trashigang \n\nroutes;  and \n\n2.\n\nImpact on Indigenous People and Cultural Properties\n\n52.\nData  from  the  social  assessment  and  other  available  documents  show  no  separate\ndisadvantaged groups who are likely to be adversely affected by the Project. Accordingly, there\nis  no  need  to  prepare  an  indigenous  people  development  plan.  Also,  the  Project  will  not\nadversely  affect  any  cultural  property.  In  fact,  the  Project  will  facilitate  access  to  some  of  the\nhighly revered spiritual centers in Bhutan.\n\n                                                \n18  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required\nfor the net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cut-off level of 12\npercent.\n\n19  Since no documented information on the poverty line of Bhutan is available, its assessment was based on the\nsame yardstick (primarily daily calorie intake food of 2,200 calorie per person per day) as that followed in India,\nadjusted  to  consider  nuances  relevant  to  Bhutan,  such  as  expenditure  on  transport,  shelter,  clothing,  fuel,  etc.\nThis is estimated to be around Nu504 per person per month or $144 per capita per year (December 1998 price\nlevel).\n\n\f16\n\n3.\n\nGender Impact\n\n53.\nThe Project has sought opportunities to address gender concerns in road construction-\nrelated  activities.  Women  will  benefit  from  the  Project  through  their  participation  in  roadwork\nopportunities, particularly in road construction, slope protection, and maintenance works. Since\nwomen in Bhutan are active producers and marketers of food, reducing the transport burden of\nrural  women  would  release  their  time  and  energy  for  more  productive  and  socially  beneficial\nactivities.  The  Project  is  expected  to  facilitate  access  to  existing  health,  social  services,  and\nschools,  making  it  possible  for  teachers,  of  which  the  majority  are  women,  to  commute  from\ntowns  to  village  schools;  and  will  enable dzongdag  or  district  administrators  to  establish  new\nschools and recruit more teachers. As a result, the enrollment rates are expected to increase for\nboth  boys  and  girls,  but  the  rate  for  girls,  which  had  been  much  lower  than  for  boys,  could\nincrease more.\n\n4.\n\nParticipatory Approach\n\nThe participatory approach was conducted during feasibility (footnote 2), fact-finding and\n54.\nappraisal to assess poverty from the perspective of a range of stakeholders and to involve them\nin  the  planning  for  follow-up  action.  Furthermore,  the  social  assessment  aims  to  inform  the\naffected  people  about  the  Project  and  its  implications  and  elicit  their  views  on  mitigation\nmeasures, suggestions, and role they could play. The local community, particularly the poor, will\nbe  informed  and  encouraged  to  engage  in  road  improvement  and  maintenance  activities.  It  is\nimportant  to  maximize  the  participation  of  local  community  in  road  improvement  and\nmaintenance activities.\n\n55.\nAs part of project preparation an assessment of the well being of women road workers\nwas  conducted.20  The  participatory  gender  assessment  of  the  road  workers  covered  different\nparts  of  the  country  and  provided  a  sound  base  for  planning  programs  for  improving  the\nconditions and well-being of road workers in general, and women and children in particular. A\nsurvey was carried out along the East-West Highway. Primary data generated through field visit,\ninterview, and questionnaire formed the baseline information to determine gender ratio, working\nconditions, effectiveness of the World Food Program, social and welfare facilities available; and\nidentify constraints and opportunities. This was supplemented by the analysis of policies on the\nnational  workforce,  secondary  information  on  the  role  of  private  contractors  and  Government\nagencies, and consultations with relevant authorities.\n\n5.\n\nLocal Labor\n\n56.\nThe  Government  encourages  private  construction  companies  to  employ  local  labor\ninstead  of  imported  labor  from  India  and  Nepal  for  road  construction.  Any  negative  impact  on\ngroups  and  individuals  will  be  identified  and  remedied.  For  example,  the  use  of  child  labor  in\nconstruction  activities  is  not  allowed.  Close  monitoring  during  supervision  will  pay  attention  to\nthe specific contractual clauses incorporated in the sample bidding documents.\n\n6. \n\nCommunicable Diseases\n\n57.\nIn  addition  to  the  provisions  included  in  each  civil  works  contract,  the  Government  is\ncurrently  taking  necessary  measures  to  promote  awareness  and  to  prevent  the  spread  of\n\n                                                \n20  Under TA 5889-REG: Gender and Development Initiatives, for $850,000, approved on 13 December 1999.\n\n\f17\n\ncommunicable diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDS. ADB is\nalso supporting Government\u2019s efforts under the proposed Health Care Reform Program.\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty Reduction\n\n58.\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  current  project  classification  system,  the  Project\u2019s  primary  objective  is\neconomic growth and the secondary objective poverty reduction as it targets the poorer areas of\nthe country. Under the new project classification effective 2001, the Project would be classified\nas pro-poor growth. The overall project strategy of poverty reduction was formulated in terms of\nthree  approaches:  (i)  pro-poor  growth;  (ii)  improved  quality  of  life;  and  (iii)  employment\nopportunities for the poorest population of the country.\n\n1.\n\nPro-Poor growth\n\n59.\nMore  rapid  economic  development  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  significant  reduction  in\npoverty in the hinterland and eastern regions. Existing poverty is rooted in the lack of economic\nopportunity  and  the  associated  lack  of  sufficient  employment  opportunity  and  livelihood\nactivities. Survey data on occupational distribution suggests that many of the poor in the project\narea  are  in  agriculture  (as  casual  laborers),  cottage  industries,  and  construction,  or  are\nunemployed. The expected diversification of agriculture and expansion of potentially better paid\nemployment  in  small  industries  and  tourism  are  therefore  likely  to  have  especially  significant\npoverty reduction impacts.\n\n60.\nFor farmers in general, an improved transport network can also ease the introduction of\nimproved  farming  practices  and  the  transition  from  subsistence  farming  to  cash  crops  and  a\nmarket  economy.  Improved  access  to  transportation  also  lowers  the  costs  of  inputs  such  as\nfertilizer.  Reliable  access,  e.g.,  all-weather  possibilities  to  input  and  output  markets,  can\nstimulate higher cash-crop farming production and more stable incomes, and enable the poor to\nimprove  their  management  of  risks.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  urban  population  as  well.  For\nexample, food prices for the urban poor could be reduced.\n\n2.\n\nImproved Quality of Life\n\n61.\nThe  Project  will  have  direct  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  of  all  income  groups.\nImprovements  of  the  East-West  Highway  will  not  only  provide  people  with  more  convenient\naccess to a broad range of socioeconomic opportunities, but also have strong income effects by\nlowering transport costs, and hence, the prices of consumer goods and services. In these ways,\nthe Project will contribute to improved personal welfare. Lack of affordable access deprives the\npoor of the ability to take advantage of job opportunities and even of very basic social services.\nReliable access to schools and health services contributes directly to the poor\u2019s accumulation of\nhuman capital, which is a key factor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n\n3.\n\nEmployment Opportunities for the Poor\n\nThe Project will generate demand for mostly unskilled labor and provide income-earning\n62.\nopportunities  for  the  poor  and  women.  It  will  provide  local  communities  with  employment\nopportunities offered by the privatized road construction companies. This could be of particular\nvalue to households with very small plots and/or few animals and who have to sharecrop other\nfarmers\u2019  land,  or  who  have  available  time.  These  tend  to  be  the  poorest  families.  Since  the\nProject will generate jobs for the poor who are otherwise unemployed or underemployed, it will\ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  the  road  workers.  In\n\n\f18\n\nthe project area, there are 2,748 road workers of whom 40 percent are women who work on the\nroads and are paid by DOR. Road workers are among the neediest and poorest groups in the\ncountry.  Illiteracy  and  insufficient  land  have  forced  them  to  leave  their  villages  to  join  the\nworkforce.  By  working  in  the  private  construction  companies  for  this  Project,  they  will  get  40\npercent more income than working with DOR. Therefore, the Project will improve their income-\nearning opportunity.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n63.\nThe  project  risks  mainly  relate  to  the  implementation  arrangements.  Due  to  possible\ninclement  weather  conditions,  it  will  be  important  to  adhere  to  the  implementation  schedule.\nDomestic  contractors  have  learned  from  experience  under  the  previous  ADB  Project  (footnote\n8) about the engineering requirements of the different resurfacing treatments. In addition, there\nwill  be  international  consulting  services  for  design  and  supervision  and  institutional  support  to\nDOR. It will be important that DOR establish a properly staffed PMO with qualified counterpart\npersonnel,  for  the  duration  of  the  Project,  both  in  its  Thimphu  headquarters  and  in  the  field\nwhere the improvement works will take place.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n64.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n (i) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  DOR  with  adequate  budgetary  allocations  for  timely\nimplementation of the Project.\n\n \n\n(ii)  Within  two  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  plan  its  road  sector\ninvestments  and  asset  management  activities  based  on  the  Road  Sector  Master  Plan,\nwhich will be developed under the TA for Road Planning and Management Strengthening\nProject and agreed upon with ADB.\n\n \n\n(iii)  Within one year after loan effectiveness, DOR, with the assistance of the consultants, will\nimplement  a  pilot  contractor  and  equipment  leasing  scheme,  under  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB, for domestic contractors to participate in the Project by (a) providing\nassistance  in  civil  works  contract  management;  and  (b)  leasing  equipment  owned  by\nDOR\u2019s Mechanical Division to domestic contractors.\n\n(iv) \n \n\nBased  on  the  outcome  of  the  TA  study  (footnote  4),  the  Government  will,  within  three\nyears after loan effectiveness, and in consultation with ADB, levy user charges to recover\nthe costs incurred in maintaining the national road network.\n\n \n\n(v)  Within three years after loan effectiveness, the Government will (a) consult with ADB on\nany  major  changes  made  to  the  draft  legislation  on  the  proposed  Road  Act  before\npresenting it to the Cabinet and the National Assembly; and (b) enact and make effective\nthe proposed Road Act.\n\n(vi) \n \n\nThe Government will ensure that arrangements satisfactory to ADB are made for release\nof  DOR  staff  to  participate  in  the  Project  as  domestic  consultants  independent  of  DOR,\ntogether with domestic consultants from the private sector.\n\n\f19\n\n(vii)  Upon completion of the Project, the Government will ensure that all periodic maintenance\n\n \n\nworks on the national highway network are tendered out to the private sector.\n\n \n\n(viii)  During and after project implementation, the Government will prepare annual plans on the\nnational  road  network \ninto  account  physical  measurements,  maintenance\nstandards,  and  traffic  volumes.  Based  on  these  annual  plans,  the  Government  will  (a)\nprovide  appropriate  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network;  and  (b)  ensure  that\nadequate and timely allocation of resources are made available for the maintenance of the\nnational road network.\n\ntaking \n\nB.\n\nCondition for Award of Contract\n\n65.\nDOR will not award any civil works contract under the Project until after it has obtained\nfrom  the  National  Environment  Commission  the  necessary  environmental  clearance  related  to\nthat contract.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n66.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 7,310,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Road Improvement Project,\nwith a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the\nrate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and\nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the\ndraft Loan Agreement

The RIP will involve (i) design of periodic maintenance interventions,\n(ii)  slope  protection  and  drainage  improvements,  and  (iii)  consulting  services  and  institutional\nsupport.\n\nThe  terms  of  reference  for  the  Road  Network  Study,1  under  which  the  Project  was\n2.\nprepared,  required  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultant  to  prepare  a  prioritized  road\nimprovement  program  for  the  project  roads  that  will  facilitate  the  social  and  economic\ndevelopment  of  Bhutan.  The  study  included  three  roads  totaling  941  kilometers  (km).  The\npriority  link  in  Bhutan  is  the  East-West  Highway,  546  km  long,  between  Trashigang  and\nSimtokha.  Two  other  north-south  routes,  between  Wangdue-Phodrang  and  Sarpang  and\nTrongsa and Gelephu, were also studied.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2013assisted East-West Highway Maintenance Project,2\n3.\ncompleted in 1998, made periodic maintenance interventions along portions of the project road\nand  assisted  in  developing  a  private  sector  contracting  industry  in  Bhutan.  Most  of  the\ninterventions  remain  in  good  condition,  with  only  occasional  and  minor  routine  maintenance\nrepairs necessary. However, some portions have not performed up to expectations and require\nfurther  intervention.  The  previous  project  introduced  new  construction  methods  to  nascent\nprivate contractors. Inexperience with mechanized paving methods in the past contributed to the\nearly  deterioration  of  some  roadway  improvements.  The  Project  will  benefit  from  the  previous\nexperience and apply the lessons learned in its implementation.\n\nB.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nfor  roadway \n\nThe  original  design \n\nimprovements  under \n\n4.\nthe  East-West  Highway\nMaintenance  Project  called  for  resurfacing  using  single  bituminous  surface  treatment  (SBST).\nThe  road  deteriorated  faster  than  anticipated  and,  because  of  severe  delays  in  initial\nimplementation required a more significant resurfacing intervention\u2013double bituminous surface\ntreatment  (DBST)\u2013once  construction  began.  This  markedly  increased  the  resurfacing  cost  per\nkm. To remain within the project budget, lengths of roadway improvement originally planned had\nto  be  dropped  from  the  project.  Also,  the  previous  design  interventions  did  not  include\nimprovement  of  roadside  drainage  or  slope  protection  works.  Insufficient  water  drainage  and\ninadequate slope protection along a roadway contribute significantly to road deterioration.\n\n5.\nThe  detailed  design  for  the  Project  will  be  made  immediately  before  the  tendering  and\naward  of  construction  contracts.  As  such,  very  little  road  deterioration  is  expected  to  occur\nbetween  design  and  construction,  and  no  significant  increase  in  improvements  should  be\nrequired  once  construction  starts.  The  minimum  resurfacing  intervention  proposed  is  DBST,\nwhich  is  twice  the  pavement  coverage  of  the  SBST  specified  in  the  previous  project.\nConsequently,  upgrades  in  design  are  less  likely  to  be  necessary,  and  the  cost  estimates\ndeveloped in the final design should closely represent the final construction costs.\n\n                                                \n1 \n2 \n\nTA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\nLoan  1265-BHU  (SF):  East-West Highway Maintenance Project,  for  $5.2  million,  approved  on  18  November\n1993.\n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\n6.\nAs noted, some sections improved under the previous project did not meet performance\nexpectations. Due to unfamiliarity with mechanized methods as well as equipment breakdowns,\nportions of the road were resurfaced using manual placement methods. This, in addition to the\ninsufficient  drainage  that  existed,  undoubtedly  contributed  to  the  poor  performance  of  the\nroadway.  To  prevent  the  problem  from  recurring,  all  resurfacing  will  utilize  mechanized\noperations. Further, the Project Management Office (PMO) will procure new paving equipment\nas  part  of  the  plant  hire  scheme.  It  should  be  noted  that  several  domestic  contractors  in  the\nprevious  project  did  gain  experience  in  the  mechanized  placement  of  road  resurfacing.  These\ncontractors  have  maintained  their  equipment  plant  and  complement  of  trained  personnel  and\nstand ready to participate in the Project.\n\nin \n\nConstruction  supervision \n\nthe  previous  project  also  proved \n\ninappropriate  and\n7.\ninadequate. With ADB funding from a TA grant, two independent international consultants were\nfielded  to  provide  construction  supervision  support.  This  arrangement  was  not  successful,  as\nevidenced  in  part  by  early  deterioration  of  some  road  resurfacing  improvements,  and  services\nwere terminated earlier than originally planned. Working with a grant, the Department of Roads\n(DOR) did not assume significant ownership of construction supervision. Further, no counterpart\nstaff  was  assigned  to  assist  with  construction  monitoring.  The  geographic  distance  and  time\nrequired traveling between construction sites further hampered proper supervision.\n\n8.\nFor  the  Project,  a  joint  team  of  international  and  domestic  experts  will  provide  design,\nconstruction supervision and institutional support to the PMO. The consultant will also conduct\nseveral  training  workshops  for  the  benefit  of  DOR  personnel.  The  consultancy  team  will  be\ncomposed of resident engineers and site supervisors. Each construction contract package will\nbe  continuously  monitored.  The  PMO  will  provide  counterpart  staff  to  monitor  construction\nactivities  and  concur  with  the  consultant  team  regarding  project  progress  and  quantity\ncertifications; this provides excellent opportunity for technology transfer. The consulting services\nwill  be  fully  funded  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  not  through  a  TA  grant,  thus  enhancing\nGovernment ownership.\n\nC.\n\nRoad Analysis Approach\n\n9.\nThe  existing  pavements  on  the  East-West  Highway  typically  have  a  base  course\ncomposed of waterbound macadam (WBM) with an average thickness of 320 millimeters (mm).\nA  20-mm  bituminous  overlay  forms  the  pavement  surface.  The  typical  roadway  cross-section\nconsists of a single motorized traffic lane 3.5 meters (m) wide with 1.5 m wide shoulders. The\nmaximum  design  vehicle  speed  is  80  km  per  hour  (kph).  Minimum  speeds  of  20  kph  for  light\nvehicles and 15 kph for trucks are applied to avoid unrealistically low journey speeds.\n\n10. A  road  roughness  survey  was  conducted  using  a  vehicle-mounted  bump  integrator  and\ncounter  to measure  the unevenness of the road. A calibrated odometer was used to measure\ndistance  along  the  road.  The  bump  integrator  produced  roughness  values  and  equivalent\nInternational  Roughness  Indexes  (IRI)  for  all  sections  of  the  road  studied.  The  need  for  other\nexogenous interventions in areas with unlined drains, nonfunctioning culverts, insufficient slope\nprotection, and destroyed pavements was also identified during the survey.\n\n11.\nThe  physical  surveys  and  reference  data  collection  identified  homogeneous  sections\nalong  the  road  on  the  basis  of  traffic  volumes,  road  roughness  measurements,  altitude,  and\nroad  gradient.  These  sections  were  used  in  a  modified  version  of  the  Highway  Design  and\nMaintenance (HDM) model to prioritize the need for intervention.\n\n\f29\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\n12.\nThe  HDM  program  prioritizes  road  data  input  to  calculate  vehicle  operating  costs.  The\nprogram  was  adapted  to  conditions  specific  to  Bhutan  and  the  East-West  Highway.  For\nexample, a higher likelihood for crack progression was input into the model, due to the poor soil\ntypes  and  the  freeze-thaw  cycles  prevalent  at  the  higher  elevations.  A  lower  rate  of  rutting\nprogression  was  used  due  to  the  low  traffic  values.  Other  relevant  inputs  were  modified\naccording  to  Bhutan\u2019s  environmental  and  climatic  conditions.  The  adaptations  specialized  the\nmodel  to  give  more  accurate  results  for  the  East-West  Highway  analysis.  Considering  other\ncosts, such as maintenance, fuel, lubricant, tires, and license fees, the study recommended the\nneed for periodic maintenance of about 350 km of roads, roughly 63 percent of the total length.\nThat figure was used to develop indicative packages for design interventions.\n\nD.  Design Philosophy\n\nThe  study  first  identified  four  periodic  maintenance  interventions,  which  consider  local\n\n13.\ncontractor capabilities, DOR experience, and engineering best practices:\n\nOption 1: DBST chip seal applied every 6 years.\nOption 2: DBST chip seal applied when roughness IRI is 6.5 m/km.\nOption 3: 100 mm WBM base course with double surface treatment chip seal.\nOption 4: 40 mm hot mix overlay.\n\n14.\nThe  most  appropriate  rehabilitations  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  are  option  1\nand  option  3.  On  sections  where  the  existing  pavement  surface  is  in  fair  condition,  a  DBST\noverlay  will  be  applied  to  provide  a  smoother,  more  uniform  riding  surface  and  to  protect  the\nexisting  pavement,  thus  extending  the  serviceable  life  of  the  road.  Road  sections  in  more\ndeteriorated condition will first be strengthened with the WBM base course before receiving the\nDBST overlay. Road sections now severely eroded or destroyed will be reconstructed as part of\nthe exogenous interventions before road surfacing.\n\n15.\nThe  pavements  will  be  designed  in  accordance  with  Indian  Standards  for  a  10-year  life,\nwith provision for overlays every 7 years to extend the road\u2019s life up to 15-20 years. The designs\nwill be based on traffic counts and traffic projections (for capacity), axle load surveys, deflection\ntests  and  projections  (for  structural  capacity).  With  the  WBM  base  course  in  option  3,  the\npavement structure will consist of an improved, well-compacted subgrade, with WBM subbase\nand base courses, which consist of 20-50 mm sizes gravels and 20-25 mm bituminous wearing\ncourse.  The  roughness  values  for  the  existing  roads  are  between  IRI6  and  12.  The  target\nroughness values after periodic maintenance is 5.\n\n16. Other  exogenous  construction  works  will  also  be  provided  to  ensure  that  periodic\nmaintenance interventions achieve or exceed their intended design life and that the reduction in\nvehicle costs achieves the expected levels. These interventions include slope protection through\nretaining  walls  or  revetments,  construction  of  new  culverts  and  repair  of  existing  ones,  and\nconstruction of new lined drains.\n\n17.\nThe indicative construction packages proposed for the Project are based on the feasibility\nanalysis and preliminary designs. The packages as presented may be revised by the consultant\non the  basis of  final designs, which will be completed immediately before tendering the works\nfor construction.\n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nE.\n\nTechnical Standards\n\n18.\n\nThe principal international standards for detailed design are the following:\n\n(i) \n\nhighways: recommendations of Indian Standard (IS), Indian Road Congress (IRC)\nand  Transport  Research  Laboratory  (TRL),  as  in  Overseas  Road  Note  6,  TRRL,\nUnited Kingdom;\n\n(ii) \n\nculverts and other drainage structures: IS; and\n\n(iii) \n\npavements testing and design: IS, IRC, and TRL Road Note 31.\n\nThe IS and IRC will be used to design all exogenous interventions.

The network is still relatively limited but adequate to serve the\ncountry\u2019s  economic  development  and  social  needs.  Therefore  the  policy  of  the  Royal\nGovernment  of  Bhutan  is  to  focus  on  maintaining  the  existing  road  network  rather  than\nexpanding it during the current Eighth Five-Year Plan.\n\nTo  support  these  objectives,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financed  technical\n2.\nassistance (TA)1 to help the Department of Roads (DOR) develop a sustainable road transport\nnetwork  to  provide  access  and  economic  development.  This  TA  was  carried  out  during  1999\nand, among other things, resulted in the preparation of a prioritized road network improvement\nprogram to facilitate the social and economic development of Bhutan.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe  primary  objective  of  this  ADB  Project  is  to  undertake  a  road  improvement  project\n3.\nthat  will  address  the  majority  of  the  periodic  maintenance  needs  on  the  Simtokha-Trashigang\nHighway (the East-West Highway). Another objective is to improve slope stability along portions\nof the East-West Highway as well as the Wangdue-Sarpang Highway and the Trongsa-Gelephu\nHighway.  Approximately  nine  individual  contract  packages  for  resurfacing  of  the  roadway  are\nenvisaged,  with  about  half  to  be  prepared  on  a  fast-track  schedule  for  an  early  start  of\nconstruction activities. Smaller contract packages for slope stability improvement works on other\nsections of the roadway not receiving periodic maintenance will also be developed throughout\nthe project for less experienced or petty contractors.\n\n4.\nThe Project includes consulting services and institutional support in specific areas where\nexisting capacities or resources are limited. It will involve (i) designing of periodic maintenance\ninterventions including patching, pavement strengthening or leveling course as required, surface\ntreatment,  minor  drainage  and  slope  protection  works;  (ii)  assisting  DOR  in  contractor\nprequalification,  preparation  of  bid  documents,  bid  evaluation,  contract  negotiations,  and\nsecuring necessary approvals, (iii) developing a slope stability program for DOR (para. 5);  (iv)\nsupervising  the  periodic  maintenance  contracts;  (v)  assisting  DOR  in  procuring,  through\ninternational shopping, road construction and materials lab testing equipment; and (vi) training\nand building the capacity of DOR personnel in road maintenance and contract management. All\nthese activities will be coordinated through the project management office (PMO).\n\nAlthough the prime purpose of the Project is to improve the existing road pavement and\n5.\nassociated  drainage,  it  is  recognized  that  slope  instability,  road  blockages  and  landslides  are\nmajor  causes  of  traffic  disruption,  pavement  damage,  and  environmental  degradation.\nAccordingly,  some  slope  protection  will  be  required,  both  within  and  outside  the  identified\nperiodic  maintenance  contract  packages.  Due  to  cost  constraints,  only  a  limited  portion  of  the\nslope  instability  affecting  each  periodic  maintenance  contract  package  will  be  addressed.  The\nconsultant  will  be  required  to  prioritize  the  individual  sites,  in  consultation  with  the  PMO,  to\n\n                                                \n1 \n\nTA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\narrive  at  the  most  cost-effective  solution  overall.  The  consultant  will  also  assist  DOR  in\nintegrating  slope  stability  measures  into  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  operations\nnationwide.\n\nC.\n\nThe Consultant\n\nD. \n\nScope of Work\n\nThe consultant must be an international consultant from a member country of ADB, who\n6.\nmay  associate  with  other  similarly  eligible  international  consultants,  and  who  is  obliged  to\nassociate with domestic consultants. An international consultant must lead the association.\n\nThe  TA  consultants  produced  samples  of  prequalification  documents,  bid  documents\n7.\n(Instructions  to  Bidders,  Conditions  of  Contract,  Technical  Specifications,  specimen  Bills  of\nQuantities, Schedules of Supplementary Information, and appropriate forms), and bid evaluation\ndocuments  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Finance  Financial  Manual,  Chapter  17,\nupdated  in  July  1998.  The  documents  are  substantially  based  on  standard  Sample  Bidding\nDocuments produced by ADB.\n\nThe  contract  packages  proposed  by  the  TA  consultants  are  in  the  table.  These  are\n\n8.\nindicative packages that may be modified according to the detailed design.\n\nPM-1a\nPM-2\nPM-3\nPM-4 a\nPM-5\nPM-6\nPM-7a\nPM-8a\nPM-9a\n\nPackage\nNumber\n\nKilometer\n\nFrom\n11\n40\n181\n225\n319\n376\n434.5\n482.5\n525\n\nTo\n40\n94\n225\n257\n376\n427.7\n482.5\n525\n546\n\nLength\n(km)\n29.0\n54.0\n44.0\n32.0\n57.0\n43.7\n48.0\n42.5\n21.0\n\n371.2\n\nTotal\na     Proposed fast-track packages.\n\n9.\n\nDuring detailed design of the contract packages, the consultants will\n\n(i) \n\nevaluate  the  pavement  strength  including,  as  necessary,  Benkelman  beam\ndeflection  testing,  trial  pitting,  laboratory  testing  of  the  pavement  layers  and\nsubgrade  DCP  (dynamic  cone  penetrometer)  tests.

The  Project  was  prepared  under  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)1  between  May  and  November  1999.  The\nIEE  was  carried  out  in  three  stages:  (i)  fieldwork  along  the  main  highway  network  to  observe\nenvironmental  conditions  and  listen  to  the  concerns  of  stakeholders;  (ii)  interaction  with  other\nmembers of the project design team to ensure that environmental constraints and opportunities\nwere fully reflected in the project proposals; and (iii) preparation of the IEE documentation (IEE\nand Summary IEE).\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n2.\nMuch of Bhutan\u2019s main highway network was constructed during the 1960s by the Indian\nBorder  Roads  Organization  (IBRO).  Investment  in  structures\u2014particularly  retaining  walls  and\nside drainage\u2014has been insufficient and landslides frequently block the roads. Some stretches\nof the pavement are in very poor condition, and in many locations the base courses are showing\nsigns of failure. The Department of Roads (DOR) under the Ministry of Communications (MOC)\nis  a  relatively  young  organization,  with  inadequate  resources  for  dealing  with  the  demands  of\nroutine, periodic, and emergency road maintenance.\n\n3.\nThe road contracting industry is small scale and requires strengthening; and so does the\nconsulting  engineering  profession.  Bhutan\u2019s  engineers  have  few  opportunities  for  continuing\nprofessional  development.  To  respond  to  these  challenges,  the  Project  has  two  major\ncomponents:  road  improvement  program  and  road  sector  institutional  strengthening  program.2\nThe  road  improvement  works  will  concentrate  on  the  East-West  Highway    (Route  No.  1)\nbetween Simtokha near Thimphu and Trashigang (546 km). Other roads will be treated if funds\nare available.\n\n4.\nThe  periodic  maintenance  activities  proposed  in  the  Project  fall  into  ADB\u2019s  screening\ncategory  B/C,  projects  judged  to  have  some  adverse  environmental  impacts,  but  of  lesser\ndegree  and/or  significance  than  those  for  category  A  projects.  For  this  category,  an  IEE  is\nrequired  to  determine  whether  or  not  significant  environmental  impacts  warranting  an\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded\nas  the  final  environmental  assessment  report.  Under  Bhutan\u2019s  environmental  screening\nprocess, this type of project falls into category C, impacts moderate, project repetitive. Project of\nthis  category  does  not  require  further  environmental  assessment,  but  do  require  formal\nenvironmental  clearance  from  the  National  Environment  Commission  (NEC).  Impacts  of\ncategory C projects are best controlled through application of Codes of Practice.\n\n                                                \n1\n2 \n\nTA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development Project, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\nThis Program will be carried out under TA 3470-BHU: Road Planning and Management Strengthening Project,\nfor $954,000, approved on 20 July 2000.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\n5.\nThe  project  roads  are  situated  in  a  mountainous  environment,  with  elevations  ranging\nfrom  300  meters  above  sea  level  (m  asl)  in  the  Terai  to  about  3700  m  asl  at  Thrumshingla.\nRegional climates vary from subtropical in the south through warm temperate to cool temperate.\nThe  climate  is  monsoonal,  with  most  rain  falling  between  June  and  September.  Annual  totals\nmay  exceed  5,000  millimeters  (mm)  at  Sarpang  and  Galephu.  In  rain  shadow  areas  and  at\nhigher  elevations,  annual  totals  may  be  much  less,  down  to  1,200  mm.  In  the  front  ranges,\nrainfall  intensities  can  reach  600  mm/day,  but  again  are  much  less  at  higher  elevations  and\ninterior  valleys. \nis\ngeomorphologically active. Most slopes are only marginally stable, and landsliding is common.\nThe geology is mixed, with rock types varying from hard quartzite to soft mudstone.\n\nthe  highest  passes  are  closed  by  snow.  The  region \n\nIn  winter \n\n2.\n\nEcological Resources\n\n6.\nBhutan  is  a  country  of  extreme  biodiversity.  Below  the  tree  line  (approx.  4,000  m),  the\nvegetation  is  forest.  Most  of  this  is  still  intact,  and  so  most  of  the  project  roads  lie  within\ntemperate  or  subtropical  forested  landscapes.  Forest  types  crossed  by  the  roads  include  fir,\nblue  pine,  mixed  conifer,  upland  hardwood,  lowland  hardwood,  chir  pine,  and  subtropical\nlowland.  The  forests  offer  a  full  range  of  ecosystem  services,  including  wildlife  habitat  and\nwatershed protection, and are important economically (both commercially and for subsistence).\nMany medicinal plants are found in the forests, at all elevations. Bhutan retains an exceptional\nrange of wildlife that includes many endemic species. Many are nationally or internationally rare,\nendangered,  or  threatened.  Flagship  mammalian  species  utilizing  the  terrain  crossed  by  the\nproject roads include red panda, Himalayan and sloth bear, tiger, elephant, and golden langur.\nThe  temperate  broadleaf  forests  are  particularly  important  as  habitat  for  birds,  of  which  770\nspecies  have  been  identified  to  date.  Birdlife  International  has  listed  Bhutan  as  a  Priority  1\nEndemic  Bird  Area.  Habitat  degradation  and  loss,  subsistence  and  commercial  hunting,  and\npoisoning have affected some wildlife populations. However, the prevailing Buddhist culture and\nlow population density combine to reduce the severity of the threats to wildlife, especially when\ncompared  with  that  in  other  South  and  Southeast  Asian  states.  The  project  road  crosses  one\nnational park and four proposed biodiversity corridors linking protected areas.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\nBhutan\u2019s population is approximately 600,000, of whom some 85 percent are rural and\n7.\ndepend on agriculture for a living. Population growth is reported to be 3.1 percent per year. The\nsettlements  connected  by  the  project  roads  are  very  small,  with  district  centers  housing  a\nmaximum  of  a  few  thousand  people.  The  communications  infrastructure  includes  the  road\nnetwork, now standing at about 3,375 kilometers (km), and a new national telecommunications\nsystem. There is no internal air service and no inland navigation. All other transport is on foot,\nby horse, mule, or yak.\n\nIndustrial activities are very limited. The most important strategic industry is hydropower.\n8.\nThis  is  developing  rapidly,  with  electricity  sales  to  India  seen  as  providing  the  bulk  of  state\nincome in future years. Two hydro projects are relevant to the project: (i) the ongoing Kurichhu\nProject, under construction by Indian contractors on the Kurichhu, some 7 km south of the East-\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nWest Highway; and the planned Mangdechhu Project, located on the Mangdechhu immediately\nbelow Trongsa town and Dzong, which will have access to India.\n\nLocal  administration  is  carried  out  through  districts  (Dzongkhag)  and  blocks  (geog).  At\n9.\nthe  national  level,  environmental  policy  is  developed  and  implemented  by  NEC.  With  ADB\nassistance,3 Bhutan recently established a formal process for environmental assessment of all\nmajor  projects.  The  new  system  includes  both  sectoral  guidelines  for  assessing  road  and\nhighway proposals and a code of practice for road construction and rehabilitation.\n\n4.\n\nQuality-of-Life Values\n\n10.\nThe  population  of  Bhutan  is  predominantly  rural  and  poor.  Health  services  are  free.\nSerious  health  problems  include  respiratory  infections,  mother/child  mortality,  accidents\n(including traffic accidents), and vector-borne diseases such as malaria. An important constraint\non the provision of health care is physical access. Due to the remoteness of many settlements,\nit  is  often  very  difficult  for  patients  to  reach  appropriate  facilities.  Bhutan  has  many  important\ncultural  heritage  sites,  archaeological,  historical,  and  religious.  The  most  spectacular  are  the\ndzongs,  but  the  list  also  includes  sites  of  battles  and  sacred  natural  features  such  as  pools,\nmountains,  and  caves.  Information  on  such  sites  is  readily  obtained  from  local  residents.\nBhutan\u2019s  national  identity  centers  on  Buddhist  values.  In  environmental  terms,  the  most\nimportant  is  the  interdependence  of  all  life  forms.  Bhutan  is  a  very  important  reservoir  for\ntraditional ecological knowledge or IK (indigenous knowledge), particularly in relation to the use\nand properties of medicinal plants.\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nImpacts due to Project Location\n\n11.\nThe  Project  concerns  road  periodic  maintenance  and  will  not  involve  road  widening,\nrealignment, or new construction. This aspect of the Project will not give rise to any significant\nimpacts.  Small-scale  construction  camps,  contractor\u2019s  facilities,  and  quarries  will  be  needed.\nSubject  to  appropriate  site-specific  planning  and  control  through  Environmental  Codes  of\nPractice,  those  structures  will  not  give  rise  to  unacceptable  impacts.  The  project  road  passes\nthrough one national park and four proposed biodiversity corridors. Appropriate responses are\nto (i) ensure that wildlife is not harassed; (ii) consult with national park managers with respect to\nwildlife  concerns,  labor  force  management,  etc.;  (iii)  coordinate  with  national  park  managers\nwith respect to road maintenance activities and scheduling; (iv) avoid quarrying within national\nparks; (v) avoid siting work or labor camps within national parks; and (vi) review siting of existing\nnational workforce camps.\n\n2.\n\nImpacts due to Project Design\n\n12.\nThe Project is designed to carry out much-needed highway periodic maintenance and to\nimprove relevant domestic capacity. It will result in an overall reduction of environmental impact\ncompared  with  the  without-project  scenario,  especially  in  relation  to  (i)  siting  and  operation  of\n\n                                                \n3 \n\nTA  2535\u2013BHU: Strengthening EIA Capabilities & Preparation of Environmental Guidelines, for $350,000,\napproved on 13 February 1996.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nquarries,  (ii)  slope  failure  caused  by  inadequate  drainage,  and  (iii)  use  of  firewood  for  heating\nbitumen.\n\n3.\n\nImpacts during Construction\n\n(i)  Erosion and sedimentation. The Project will not involve earthworks.\n\n(ii)  Hydrology  and  Drainage.  The  Project  will  improve  road  drainage.  No\n\nsignificant impact from this activity is foreseen.\n\n(iii)  Paving  and  Firewood.  A  major  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  physical  works  will  be\npaving.  At  present  this  activity  uses  firewood.  The  Project  will  require\nnonwood  burning  technologies  for  heating  asphalt  in  all  dzongkhags\n(Thimphu, Wangdue-Phodrang, Mongar, and Trashigang).\n\n(iv)  Construction  Materials.  The  Project  will  require  appreciable  quantities  of\naggregates for paving works. Historically, stone has been collected from the\nroadside or from shallow workings, with significant negative impacts. Sand\nand gravel are obtained from rivers. Small aggregate may also be produced\nby  hand.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  improve  the  system  for\nsupply  of  construction  materials  by  developing  district-level  plans,  and\npossibly centralized quarries.\n\n(v)  Traffic.  It  will  not  be  possible  to  bypass  the  works,  so  providing  continued\naccess  for  normal  traffic  will  be  a  major  element  in  construction  planning.\nHazards could occur and should be minimized though appropriate signing,\nlighting,  flagmen,  etc.  Construction  traffic  should  be  subject  to  standard\ncontrols on speed, vehicle loading, sheeting, etc.\n\n(vi)  Camps:  The  Project\u2019s  construction  camps  could  be  foci  for  various  health\nand  social  problems.  These  can  be  avoided  or  minimized  through\nconsultation  with  the  relevant  district  and  geog  officials,  and  camp\nmanagement.\n\n(vii)  Labor: Employment would be a major temporary benefit of the works.\n\n(viii)  Health  and  Safety.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  improve  safety\nand  working  conditions,  through  training  and  development  of  relevant\ncontractual conditions.\n\n4.\n\nImpacts during Road Operation\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAir quality. The Project will not affect Bhutan\u2019s excellent air quality.\n\nSeverance.  Severance  is  not  a  problem  along  the  project  roads,  and\npredicted traffic levels will not result in severance being a problem in any\nof the communities served by the road.\n\n\f(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n50\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nAccidents.  Improving  the  pavement  is  likely  to  result  in  higher  vehicle\nspeeds.  This  may  result  in  more  accidents  and  increased  severity  of\naccidents.  A  particular  concern  is  the  hazard  to  roadside  residents,\nespecially children, from speeding through-traffic. Mitigation measures to\nconsider  include  engineering  measures  for  differentiating  between  high-\nspeed  rural  areas  and  settlements,  including  speed  bumps  and  rumble\nstrips;  and  incorporating  safety  measures  in  the  design  of  the  project,\nspecifically superelevation on bends when the pavement is reconstructed,\nguardrails, provision for pedestrians, and reflective roadside markings.\n\n(iv) \n\nFire. The project will not alter the situation with respect to roadside fires.\n\nInduced  development.  Roadside  development  is  tightly  controlled  by  the\ndistrict  administrations.  The  Project  will  not  contribute  to  uncontrolled\ndevelopment.\n\nInternational  trade.  Road  improvements  to  be  carried  out  under  the\nProject are unlikely to have any measurable effect on international trade\nconsidering  the  unsustainable  use  of  timber,  wildlife,  and  other  forest\nproducts.\n\n5.\n\nImpacts of the Environment on the Project\n\n13.\n\nThe Project will be significantly affected by weather and by slope processes.\n\nWeather.  The  dominant  climatic  feature  in  Bhutan  is  the  monsoon.\nRoutine  and  periodic  maintenance  works  during  this  time  are  difficult.\nActivities focus on emergency landslide clearance. It is important that no\nearthworks are carried out during the monsoon. Maintenance work at high\nelevations can be constrained by frost and snow.\n\nSlopes.  The  roads  traverse  a  geomorphologically  active  landscape  in\nwhich  landsliding  are  the  rule  rather  than  the  exception.  This  has  many\nimplications for road design, construction, and maintenance: slopes must\nbe treated with great respect, and disturbance to them minimized.\n\n6.\n\nUnlikely Impacts\n\n14.\n\nThe following impacts are considered unlikely to occur in this road maintenance Project\n\ninvoluntary displacement due to land take for the works,\n\n(i) \n(ii)  unwarranted alteration of traditional lifestyles,\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v)  unmanageable immigration to the project area, and\n(vi)  unmanageable induced and/or roadside development.\n\nincreased direct access to unprotected ecologically valuable resources,\nincreased unsustainable or illegal use of natural resources,\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 11, page 6\n\n7.\n\nPotential Enhancement Measures\n\nThe Project provides an opportunity for major enhancement measures. From the point of\n\n15.\nview of continuous access, slope stabilization is the most important:\n\n(i) \n\nSlope Stabilization. Pavement and drainage works are only part of the answer to\nensuring  continued  road  operation.  Additional  and  improved  slope  stabilization\nworks  are  required  in  many  areas.  Implementation  of  an  appropriate  slope-\nrelated program would maximize the effectiveness of the funds available to DOR.\nA  13-point  action  plan  covering  a  range  of  slope  stability  issues,  in  order  of\npriority, is presented in the Slope Stabilization Manual.4 In addition, it is strongly\nrecommended that DOR consider more extensive use of bioengineering.\n\n(ii)  Water  Management.  The  Project  offers  an  opportunity \n\nto  assist  some\ncommunities  with  the  supply  of  irrigation  water,  and  to  solve  problems  of\nuncontrolled irrigation water disposal. The Project could assist both the Ministry\nof  Agriculture  and  DOR  to  install  dual-purpose  roadside  water  management\nstructures where needed.\n\n(iii) \n\nRoad  Safety.  As  noted,  the  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  improve  road\nsafety by incorporating various engineering measures in the program of works.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring\n\n1.\n\nInstitutional Capacity and Requirements\n\nAt  present  DOR  has  limited  capacity  to  implement  and  enforce  the  environmental\n16.\nprovisions for road projects, which are emerging from Bhutan\u2019s new environmental assessment\nprocess.  Since  environment-friendly  techniques  are  central  to  low-cost  mountain  road\nengineering,  it  is  essential  that  DOR  increase  its  ability  to  design  and  implement  these\nmeasures.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  for  relevant  training  directed  at  road\nmaintenance operations. Such training will complement and amplify technical assistance being\nprovided  to  DOR  relating  to  new  feeder  road  construction  (proposed  United  Nations  Capital\nDevelopment  Fund  Feeder  Roads  Project  BHU/98/C02)  and  rural  access  (International\nDevelopment Association /SNV Rural Access Project).\n\n17.\nEnvironmental  aspects  of  road  maintenance  where  improved  techniques  will  be  of\nbenefit  include  paving, drainage, Construction Materials, slopes stabilization, earthworks, spoil\ndisposal,  snow  clearance,  safety,  consultation,  contract  documentation,  contractors,  and\nenforcement.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Management\n\n18.\nThe  Project  will  incorporate  a  number  of  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  impacts  on\nsensitive  receptors.  These  can  be  dealt  with  through  the  application  of  the  existing\nEnvironmental Code of Practice for the Road Sector.\n\n                                                \n4 \n\nThe Slope Stabilization Manual was prepared under TA 3107-BHU.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11, page 7\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring\n\nThe  project  manager  in  DOR\u2019s  project  management  office  will  be  responsible  for\n19.\nmonitoring  environmental  compliance.  At  the  field  level,  site  engineers  will  carry  out  periodic\nmonitoring,  while  day-to-day  monitoring \nthe\nrequirements  established  in  the  contract  documents.  An  environmental  specialist  on  the\nconsulting services team for design, supervision, and institutional support will assist DOR with\nenvironmental monitoring.\n\nthe  contractors\u2019  responsibility \n\nfulfill \n\nto \n\nis \n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n1.\n\nEvaluation of IEE\n\n20.\nThis IEE has identified (i) sensitive environmental receptors such as slopes, wildlife, and\nhabitat; (ii) important technological issues such as sourcing construction materials, and heating\nbitumen; (iii) mitigating measures in case of environmentally damaging activities included in the\nProject  like  earthworks;  (iv)  important  enhancement  opportunities  such  as  slope  stabilization,\nwater management, and health and safety; and (v) strengthening of environmental capability for\nthe  key  actors  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  including  project  engineers,  contractors,\nengineers, and domestic consultants.\n\nThe authors of the IEE consider the effort involved sufficient to guide decision making on\n\n21.\nthis project.\n\n2.\n\nFurther Environmental Work Required\n\nFurther  environmental  work  is  required  during  project  preparation:  (i)  incorporating  the\n22.\nIEE  recommendations  in  the  Project\u2019s  final  design;  and  (ii)  drafting  a  Project  Prospectus  for\nsubmission by DOR to NEC to obtain formal environmental clearance.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\n23.\nThe  IEE  concludes  that  the  Project,  as  proposed,  does  not  require  an  environmental\nimpact  assessment.  The  road  improvement  activities  proposed  in  the  RIP  fall  into  NEC\u2019s\nscreening  category\u2013C  Impacts moderate, project repetitive.  Projects  in  this  category  do  not\nrequire  further  environmental  assessment,  but  require  formal  environmental  clearance  from\nNEC. To receive domestic environmental clearance, DOR needs to develop and submit to NEC\na formal Project Prospectus. Impacts of category C projects are best controlled through Codes\nof  Practice,  in  this  case,  through  the  existing  Environmental  Code  of  Practice  for  the  Road\nSector, completed in 1999.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nA.\n\nAnalysis of Basic Data\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n\nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  proposed  road  improvements  was  based  on  the\n1.\nfollowing  basic  data:  (i)  road  condition,  traffic,  and  axle-load  surveys;  (ii)  analysis  of  road\nimprovement costs; and (iii) review of vehicle operating costs (VOCs).\n\n1.\n\nAssessment of Road Condition\n\n2.\nA road roughness survey was carried out using a vehicle-mounted bump integrator and\ncounter to measure the unevenness of the road profile, and a calibrated odometer to measure\ndistance along the road.  The bump integrator produced roughness values and the equivalent\ninternational  roughness  index  (IRI)  for  all  sections  of  the  road  being  considered  for\nimprovement. Also, a road inventory and condition survey was conducted using a standard four-\nwheel drive pickup with a distance/speed sensor spliced to the vehicle speedometer cable. This\nequipment  was  interfaced  with  the  ROMDAS  software.    This  allowed  the  location  of  inventory\nfeatures and their condition to be recorded.  Events were recorded on the computer keyboard\nas point events or continuous events.  Point events are those on or adjacent to the road such as\na culvert or a pothole. Continuous events are those that apply over a section of the road such as\ndrains or cracking. During the inventory and condition survey, exogenous interventions such as\nthe construction of new drainage structures and/or slope protection works were identified.\n\n3.\nFollowing  the  physical  surveys  on  the  project  roads,  homogeneous  sections  were\ndefined  based  on  traffic  volumes  derived  from  the  traffic  analysis,  roughness  observed  during\nthe surveys, and altitude and gradient of the roads. On inspection, the East-West Highway was\nsubdivided into 24 homogenous sections, the Sarpang-Wangdue Highway, 9 sections and the\nTrongsa-Gelephu Highway, 12 sections. The resultant homogeneous sections together with the\nengineering data were used in the Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM) analysis.\n\n2.\n\nAxle-Load Surveys\n\nTo check on the loading characteristics of trucks, an axle-load survey was undertaken at\n4.\nLobesa,  west  of  Wangdue.    In  total  68  vehicles  were  weighed:  45  trucks  of  various  sizes,  12\nbuses, and 11 other vehicles.  All lighter vehicles were discarded in assessing vehicle damage\nfactors.  In the case of trucks, 55 percent of the vehicles had gross vehicle weight (GVW) under\n12  tons  and  45  percent  above  12  tons.  However,  70  percent  of  trucks  had  damage  factors  of\nequivalent  standard  axle  (ESA)  below  3.0  and  30  percent  above  3.0.    Overall,  the  estimated\naverage damage factor for trucks was ESA 2.01. Buses were generally lighter, with all vehicles\nsurveyed being under 12 tons GVW. The calculated damage factor for all buses was below ESA\n0.5.    The  estimated  overall  average  ESA  for  buses  was  estimated  0.11.  Estimated  damage\nfactors for both trucks and buses compare reasonably well with default suggestions in the HDM\nmodel as well as with those in previous studies.  The estimates of ESAs for trucks and buses\nwere subsequently incorporated into the pavement deterioration analysis in HDM III.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n3.\n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections\n\n5.\nFor  analysis  purposes  traffic  volumes  for  three  types  of  motorized  vehicles  were\ndeveloped.  The  level  of  traffic  on  the  project  roads  was  determined  by  referring  to  recent\nDepartment  of  Roads  (DOR)  traffic  count  data.    This  was  compared  with  figures  in  recent\nstudies relating to the transport sector in Bhutan to check on the validity of the base information.\nTraffic  on  the  project  roads  is  subject  to  a  range  of  influences,  some  of  which  are  markedly\nseasonal. In particular, the extremely low temperatures in winter on the high mountain passes\nmake  the road difficult to drive on. During the monsoon season in June-September, many road\nsections become difficult to negotiate, which also reduces traffic levels. Seasonal factors were\napplied to the traffic counts and base year traffic was obtained. It is evident, Table A12.1 that\ntraffic is much higher in the west, toward Thimphu, than in the east.  Light vehicles predominate\nin the traffic mix, with trucks comprising the majority of the remainder.\n\nTable A12.1: Traffic on the East-West Highway (AADT)\n\nSection\nTrashigang \u2013 Mongar\nMongar \u2013 Jakar\nJakar \u2013 Trongsa\nTrongsa \u2013 Wangdue\nWangdue \u2013 Lobesa\nLobesa \u2013 Simtokha\nAADT \u2013 average annual daily traffic.\n\nLight\n33\n28\n38\n100\n184\n323\n\nBus\n1\n1\n3\n3\n9\n21\n\nTruck\n35\n23\n16\n64\n86\n131\n\nTotal\n69\n52\n57\n167\n279\n475\n\n6.\nFor the forecast, two types of traffic are considered: normal and generated traffic. Since\nthe  project  road  passes  through  a  remote  area  and,  currently,  access  to  markets  and  urban\ncenters is hampered by the relatively poor condition of the road, it seems logical that if the roads\nare improved, some additional trips will be generated. The area of influence of the project roads\nis  concerned  mainly  with  pastoral  and  subsistence  farming  with  little  or  no  industrial\ndevelopment. In addition, the area has significant potential \u2013 but as yet unrealized - for tourism\ndevelopment. Diverted traffic1 has been excluded from the analysis.\n\n7.\nPredictions  of  generated  traffic  are  difficult  to  make  because  they  involve  judgment\nbased on the expected response of road users to the reduced cost of road transport due to an\nimproved road.  It is only likely to be significant in those cases where the road investment brings\nabout substantial reductions in transport costs. To estimate the amount of generated traffic,2 a\ntransport  elasticity  of  demand  of  unity  was  adopted  for  all  vehicle  types.  This  means  that  1\npercent decrease in transport costs leads to 1 percent increase in traffic.\n\nIn  developing  traffic  forecasts,  it  was  important  to  take  full  account  of  the  analysis  of\n8.\nexisting  traffic  demand,  which  showed  the  following  principal  features:  (i)  rapid  growth  of  all\n                                                \n1  Diverted traffic is traffic that would switch from another route or mode of transport if the Project is implemented,\nwhile  still  traveling  between  the  same  origin  and  destination.    The  East-West  highway  forms  part  of  the  main\ncorridor  that  links  the  country.    The  main  alternative  route  is  to  travel  south  to  the  border  and  subsequently\nthrough India. That option is unlikely.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Transport Research Laboratory has undertaken extensive research in this area and the\nrecommended approach to forecasting generated traffic is to use demand relationships.  The price elasticity of\ndemand  for  transport  measures  the  responsiveness  of  traffic  to  a  change  in  transport  costs  following  a  road\ninvestment.  Evidence from a selection of countries indicates a range of -0.6 to -2.0 for the elasticity of demand\nfor transport, with an average of about -1.0.\n\n2 \n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nmotorized  traffic,  20  percent  annual  increase  over  the  last  five  years;  (ii)  low  car  ownership,\n11/1,000 population with a growth of 21 percent annually since 1994; and (iii) dominance of the\nroad transport mode for both passengers and freight. Historic data did not seem to be consistent\nfor  forecasting  purposes.    Accordingly,  it  was  decided  to  use  factors  based  on  experience  in\nother  developing  countries,  modified  by  evidence  available  in  Bhutan.  That  experience  shows\nthat, generally, freight traffic grows at a pace similar to that of the gross domestic project (GDP),\nan implied elasticity of 1.0, and passenger traffic grows rather faster with a typical elasticity of\naround 1.2. The elasticities adopted (Table A12.2) were disaggregated into three time periods:\n1999-2006, 2007-2012, and 2013-2021. Over time, the elasticities gradually decline as is shown\nby  evidence  from  many  countries.    If  this  were  not  the  case,  the  proportion  of  the  transport\nsector  in  relation  to  total  GDP  would  continue  to  increase.    Since  the  share  of  transport  as  a\nproportion to total GDP rarely amounts to more than 10 percent this seems unlikely.\n\nThe  forecast  GDP  growth  rates  were  combined  with  the  income  elasticities  of  demand\n9.\nfor transport to give traffic growth projections for each vehicle type.  Annual traffic growth rates\nused  for  forecasts  of  future  traffic  and  road  user  benefits  were  assumed  to  vary  over  time  as\nfollows (Table A12.3):\n\nTable A12.2: Transport Demand Elasticities\n\nPeriod\n1999-2006\n2007-2012\n2013-2021\n\nLight\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n\nBus\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n\nTruck\n1.5\n1.3\n1.0\n\nTable A12.3: Traffic Growth Rates (%)\n\nPeriod\n1999-2006\n2007-2012\n2013-2021\n\nLight\n10.5\n7.2\n6.3\n\nBus\n10.5\n7.2\n6.3\n\nTruck\n8.7\n5.9\n4.5\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n1.\n\nRoad Improvement Costs and Options\n\n10.\nThe economic costs of implementing the Project were estimated from the financial costs\nof  civil  works,  physical  contingencies  and  supervision.  For  nontradable  items,  a  standard\nconversion  factor  (SCF)  of  0.93  was  used.  The  estimates  included  physical  contingencies  but\nexcluded  price  escalation,  price  contingencies,  and  interests  during  construction.  Financial\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  also  adjusted  by  the  same  approach  to  obtain\neconomic  costs.  Incremental  O&M  costs  were  calculated  as  the  difference  between  O&M\nrequirement  for  the  with-  and  without-  project  scenarios.  Economic  costs  were  estimated  in\nconstant end-1999 prices. No salvage value was considered at the end of the project life cycle.\n\n                                                \n3 \n\nSCF  based  on  the  average  level  of  direct  taxation  and  the  level  of  market  distortion  present  in  the  economy.\nEvidence from recent studies, most notably the World Bank-financed Rural Access Project, estimates a SCF of\n0.9.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nThe cost estimates of the road improvement activities were derived from several sources\n11.\nincluding DOR, Bhutanese contractors, previous studies as well as experience within the region\nand elsewhere. The activities comprise the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nRoutine  maintenance  includes  the  cleaning  of  drains  and  culverts,  removal  of  debris\nfrom  the  roadway  including  material  deposited  in  the  drains  and  roadway  from  minor\nslips,  cutting  of  vegetation  as  well  as  pothole  patching.  Each  of  these  activities  is\nassumed to occur throughout the year.\n\nPeriodic maintenance includes activities, that are required at regular intervals to restore\nthe road surface to the condition of the original construction. When performed in a timely\nmanner,  periodic  maintenance  activities  may  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  the\npavement  structure,  thereby  accommodating  increased  levels  of  traffic.    Periodic\nmaintenance  activities  may  include  resealing  such  as  surface  treatment  with  sand  or\nchip  seals  and  overlay  with  cold  or  hot  mix  asphalt.  The  periodic  maintenance\ninterventions  selected  for  this  study  took  into  consideration  local  contractor  and  DOR\nexperience and engineering best practices. Several trial runs were made using the HDM,\nincluding  the  single  surface  treatment  option,  after  which  four  options  were  selected:\noption 1, double surface treatment (DST) chip seal applied every 6 years; option 2, DST\nchip seal applied when roughness is IRI 6.5  meters per kilometer (m/km); option 3, 100\nmillimeters (mm) water-bound macadam (WBM) base course with DST; and option 4, 40\nmm  hot  mix  asphalt-concrete  (AC)  overlay.  Unit  costs  were  derived  for  each  option  by\napplying  current  unit  costs  for  labor,  equipment,  and  material;  productivity  rates  were\ndeveloped by the consultant and validated with DOR..\n\n(iii) \n\nIn  addition  to  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  capital  works  are  required  in  certain\nareas  to  ensure  that  periodic  maintenance  interventions  achieve  or  exceed  their\nintended  design  life  and  reduction  in  VOCs  achieve  expected  levels.    While  in  some\nareas  these  interventions  may  be  quite  extensive  and  could  not  be  covered  under  the\nexisting  loan,  other  areas  require  only  relatively  minor  interventions.    The  interventions\nare  (i)  reconstruction  of  destroyed  pavement,  (ii)  slope  protection,  (iii)  construction  of\nnew culverts, (iv) repair of existing culverts, and (v) construction of lined drains.\n\n2.\n\nLeast-Cost Improvement Options\n\nThe preliminary results of the economic analysis indicated option 4 (40 mm hot mix AC\n12.\noverlay)  would  produce  the  highest  returns  on  many  sections  of  the  project  road,  given  the\ngreater  reduction  in  road  roughness  offered  by  this  alternative  than  by  the  DST  options.\nHowever,  implementing  option  4  will  involve  more  sophisticated  engineering  expertise  and\nnecessitate the use of expensive plant and equipment.  Given the relatively low development of\nthe contracting industry in Bhutan at present, it is doubtful if the AC overlay solutions would be\ntechnically  feasible.    Furthermore,  while  option  4  generates  greater  benefits  than  alternative\nDST solutions, it also involves significantly greater cost. Given the circumstances, the economic\nanalysis  was  augmented  by  engineering  practicalities  that  indicate  the  most  appropriate\nrehabilitation option on each section of the East-West highway.  On the majority of the sections,\noption 1 (DST) was identified as adequate to improve the pavement to a satisfactory condition.\nOn  certain  sections  in  a  particularly  poor  condition,  however,  option  3  (100  mm  WBM  +  DST)\nwas deemed necessary.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\n3.\n\nVehicle Operating Costs\n\n13.\nThe  VOC  parameters  for  three  vehicle  types  were  developed  using  the  World  Bank\u2019s\nHDM model adjusted to local conditions. VOCs are influenced by vehicle speed, the horizontal\nand vertical alignment of the road, and the physical condition of the road surface in addition to\nvehicle type, price, age, and load.  The model utilizes the input data to calculate VOCs based on\nthe relationships originally prepared for the HDM III model of the World Bank.  Substantial input\ndata  are  provided  as  defaults  of  the  model  itself.    For  this  analysis,  however,  detailed  local\ninformation was provided as much as possible to obtain results that are specific to Bhutan. The\ninput data was based on the end-1999 prices and is net of taxes, duties, and other charges. The\noutput of the model includes physical quantities of consumption and speed, and the associated\nVOC per predefined unit of 1,000 vehicle-km. VOC estimates for the three vehicles types and\nIRI values are shown in Table A12.4.\n\nTable A12.4: Vehicle Operating Costs for Different IRIs by Vehicle Type\n(Nu/km)\n\nIRI (m/km) Light Bus Truck\n\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\n11.0\n\n4.9\n5.1\n5.3\n5.6\n6.0\n6.4\n7.0\n7.9\n9.0\n10.8\n\n7.8\n8.0\n8.3\n8.6\n9.0\n9.4\n9.8\n10.4\n11.0\n11.7\n\n9.4\n9.8\n10.2\n10.7\n11.3\n11.9\n12.7\n13.5\n14.5\n15.7\n\n4.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe  improvement  of  the  East-West  Highway  will  produce  mainly  road  user  benefits,\n14.\nwhich include savings in VOCs and time arising from the road rehabilitation.  For this analysis,\nroad  user  benefits  were  restricted  to  savings  in  VOCs  arising  from  changes  in  surface\nroughness.  Additionally,  since  transport  costs  are  relatively  high  and  improvements  offer\nsignificant  transport  cost  savings  that  will  stimulate  the  local  economy,  there  will  also  be\ndevelopment  benefits  such  as  increase  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of  agricultural  production  in\nthe project area, tourism, and industrial development.  These benefits can be measured in terms\nof net value of generated output directly attributable to the road rehabilitation or in terms of the\ntransport cost benefits secured by generated traffic.4 However, it is essential that each approach\nbe  pursued  separately  to  avoid  double  counting.  The  present  methodology  concentrates  on\nroad  user  benefits  and  adopts  the  approach  where  economic  development  benefits  are\nmeasured  in  terms  of  the  benefits  gained  by  generated  traffic.  The  benefits  from  generated\ntraffic equal half of the product of the extra number of trips and the VOC saving per trip.\n\n                                                \n4 \n\nIn  Bhutan,  freight  rates  are  determined  by  the  market  and  passenger  fares  are  regulated  but  periodically\nreviewed.  During  the  economic  evaluation  the  estimated  VOCs  showed  similarities  with  the  rates  and  fares\nactually  charged  in  the  market.  This  increases  the  confidence  that  VOC  savings  would  be  passed  on  to  the\nusers.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\nRoad improvements will change the nature and patterns of road maintenance compared\n15. \nwith continuance of the without- project scenario.  This has repercussions for the time stream of\nnet  maintenance  costs  and  there  may  be  opportunities,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  initial\nintervention,  for  net  savings  in  resource  costs.  The  incidence  of  maintenance  activities  and\nsubsequent  costs  are  determined  by  the  HDM  model.  Savings  (or  costs)  in  these  were  also\nincluded in the analysis.5 Other quantifiable benefits such as travel time savings, cargo holding\ntime savings, and  reduced agricultural cargo spoilage were also studied, but not included in the\nevaluation.  Nonquantifiable  benefits  such  as  social  benefits  and  improved  national  integration\nare described in Appendix 13.\n\n5.\n\nEconomic Rate of Return\n\nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project  compared  the  costs  and  benefits  for  the  with-\n16.\nand  without-  project  scenarios.  Benefits  based  on  VOC  savings,  in  economic  prices,  were\ncalculated  for  normal  and  generated  traffic.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  road\nimprovement  and  maintenance  costs  to  calculate  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).\nBenefit  streams  were  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years  starting  in  2001.  Costs  and  benefits\nwere estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant end-1999 prices (Table\nA12. 5.6 The base EIRR for the Project is 32 percent.\n\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRRs  to  changes  in  the  underlying  cost  and  benefit  parameters\n17.\nwas analyzed. The results (Table A12.6) show that assuming a 15 percent increase in project\ncosts would decrease the EIRR to 27 percent.  If benefits only materialized to 85 percent of the\noriginal  estimates,  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  27  percent.  In  a  more  adverse  situation  of  a\nsimultaneous  15  per  cent  increase  in  project  cost  and  15  percent  reduction  of  benefits  the\noverall  EIRR  will  be  22  percent.    The  switching  value7  for  cost  was  determined  to  be  100\npercent, and switching value for benefits was 49 percent. If project implementation is delayed by\ntwo years, the EIRR will be reduced to 20 percent.  Also if only benefits due to VOC savings of\nnormal traffic are considered, the EIRR will decrease to 25 percent.\n\n                                                \n5 \n\nIt is important to mention that a road for motor vehicles exists.  The economic and social cost of severance of the\nroad would be unacceptable. Therefore, the complete loss of motorized accessibility cannot be argued as being\na  realistic  without-the-project  case.    Indeed,  if  it  were,  it  would  be  possible  to  justify  most  infrastructure\ninvestments merely by failing to provide for their maintenance. However, it is clear that presently the project road\nis deteriorating over time.  With this in mind, it has been assumed that the project road in the without-the-project\ncase  receives  minimal  maintenance,  but  with  a  cap  in  the  IRI.    Furthermore,  between  1999  and  2001,  it  is\nassumed only routine maintenance is undertaken on the project roads.  Following 2001, works are assumed to\ninclude both routine maintenance and patching (80 percent of potholes).\nAs observed in Table A12.5 benefits from VOC savings diminish with time due to the natural deterioration of the\nroad.\nThe switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required\nfor the net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12\npercent.\n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 12, page 7\n\nTable A12.5: Economic Cost and Benefit Streams\n(Nu.

The overall objective of the study was\nto assess (i) the poverty profile of beneficiaries; (ii) the groups who are expected to benefit from,\nand  use  services  that  are  to  be  provided  by  the  Project;  (iii)  the  needs  and  demands  of  the\ngroups;  (iv)  their  absorptive  capacity;  (v)  gender  issues;  and  (vi)  possible  adverse  effects  on\nvulnerable  groups  and  the  need  for  measures  to  mitigate  such  effects  or  compensate  those\nadversely affected. The study was carried out in June-July 1999.\n\n2. \nThe main finding of the study was that the Project will lead to an improved standard of\nliving and reduced poverty and unemployment in its area of influence. This will be achieved by\nenhancing  household  mobility  and  expanding  economic  opportunities  in  the  project  area,\nparticularly  in  agriculture,  cottage  industry,  and  tourism.  Special  efforts  were  also  made  to\ninvolve  the  poor  by  providing  employment  in  the  process  of  construction  and  in  the\ninstitutionalized labor-based road maintenance, particularly for women through the Department\nof Roads\u2013national workforce.\n\n3. \nBhutan remained closed to the outside world until the 1960s when the third King opened\nlinks  with  other  countries  and  initiated  the  development  of  Bhutan  as  a  modern  nation.  Since\nBhutan  is  a  landlocked  country,  its  socioeconomic  development  depended  largely  on  the\nconstruction of roads. Bhutan now has a road network of about 3,375 kilometers (km), the main\nroutes being the East-West Highway and the four north-south highways. These connect almost\nall  dzongkhags  (districts)  and  a  large  proportion  of  the  rural  settlements.  Establishing  and\nmaintaining  these  roads  have  been  a  very  difficult  task  because  of  the  terrain  and  extreme\nvariations in climate: heavy snows in winter, and monsoon rains in summer.\n\n4. \nA social assessment using participatory approaches and surveys in the project area was\ncarried out as part of project preparation. The study consisted of socioeconomic surveys (105\nhouseholds,  about  1  percent  coverage  of  total  households  in  the  project  area),  focus  group\ndiscussions with key stakeholders such as Planning Commission and the Health and Education\nministries, Government officials in the district, social sector administrators of the nine districts in\nthe  project  area,  Road  Safety  and  Transport  Authority,  Bhutan    Development  Finance\nCorporation,  and  National  Women  Association  of  Bhutan.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  a\nrapid rural appraisal was conducted for road workers and beneficiaries in several project areas\nto assess the potential employment opportunity as well as beneficiaries\u2019 needs and constraints.\nIn addition, an initial participatory workshop on improving the well-being of women road workers\nwas conducted with key stakeholders such as the private sector, aid agencies, civil society, and\ngovernment officials during the Appraisal Mission.\n\n2.\n\nThe Project Area\n\n5. \nThe  East-West  Highway  is  the  strategic  road  link  allowing  access  across  the  country.\nWithout this road, access between the steep valleys of Bhutan would be only by horse and foot.\nThe  only  alternative  route  is  to  go  south  into  India  and  back  up  into  Bhutan.  The  road  has\n\n                                                          \n1\n\nTA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development Project, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\ntherefore  a  major  national  and  strategic  importance,  which  has  allowed  development\nopportunities  into  central  and  eastern  Bhutan.  It  links  the  districts  of  Thimphu  with  Wangdue-\nPhodrang,  Trongsa,  Bumthang,  Mongar,  and  Trashigang  and  therefore  directly  affects  the\npopulations in those areas.\n\n6. \nThe Project will influence  the  economic and social development of much of the central\nregion of Bhutan, with direct impacts on 9 of the 20 districts. Beginning in Thimphu, the capital\ncity  on  the  west,  the  road  traverses  hinterland  areas  of  the  Wangdue-Phodrang,  and  Trongsa\ndistricts,  with  access  links  to  Bumthang,  Mongar,  and  Trashigang  districts  in  the  east.  By\nimproving the road condition and accessibility, the Project will indirectly influence all districts in\nthe country.\n\n3.\n\nPoverty Data Availability\n\n7. \nThe  late  start  in  planned  development  and,  hence  lack  of  trained  and  qualified\nmanpower,  constrained  the  systematic  surveys  on  the  income  and  expenditure  patterns  of\nhouseholds  in  Bhutan.  The  limited  surveys  of  land  holdings  and  asset  ownership,  are  not\nnationally  representative.  Bhutan  has  yet  to  institute  a  comprehensive  national  sample  survey\nsystem that can collect, analyze, and report socioeconomic data periodically.\n\n4.\n\nNational Human Development and Government Strategy\n\n8. \nWith  an  estimated  gross  national  product  (GNP)  per  capita  of  $586  in  1998,  average\nBhutanese  incomes  are  low\u2013some  $1.30  per  head  per  day\u2013reflecting  widespread  income\npoverty.  However,  measuring  poverty  by  using  GNP  per  capita  often  gives  a  partial  and\ndistorted  picture  of  human  development.  This  is  perhaps  more  true  of  Bhutan  than  of  many\nother  countries.  A  large  part  of  Bhutan\u2019s  rural  economy,  which  is  predominantly  agrarian,\nremains  nonmonetized,  with  barter  systems  still  prevalent  in  many  parts  of  the  country.  The\nGovernment recognized the multiple dimensions of poverty by measuring and targeting a range\nof health, education, and other standards regarded as fundamental to human well-being.\n\n9. \nIndicators of human development showed that life expectancy in Bhutan had risen from\n48 years in 1984 to 66 years in 1998, which was three years more than the average for South\nAsia.  The  reported  infant  mortality  rate  was  71  per  1,000  live  births  in  1998.  While  that  was\nconsiderably  higher  than  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  17  deaths  per  1,000  live  births,  it  was  marginally  lower\nthan  the  average  for  South  Asia.  Life  expectancy  figures  are  strongly  influenced  by  the\nprevailing  levels  of  infant  mortality.  Many  aspects  of  life  are  reflected  in  this  one  statistic\u2013the\ncapability of parents, prevalence of malnutrition and disease, availability of clean water, efficacy\nof  health services, and,  above all, the health and status of women. Furthermore, although  the\nadult literacy rate had quadrupled in the past 20 years, that of Bhutan was 54 percent in 1998,\namong  the  lowest  in  the  South  Asia  region.  Based  on  these  indicators  above,  the  Human\nDevelopment Index in 1998 was estimated at 0.581 putting Bhutan in the category of medium\nhuman development countries along with Sri Lanka and the Maldives in South Asia.2\n\nBhutan  has  concentrated  on  supporting  socioeconomic  growth  to  ensure  universal\n10. \naccess to basic health, education, and essential social services. Thus, the abject poverty seen\nin  some  parts  of  Asia  as  a  result  of  low  incomes  is  not  evident,  as  the  Government\u2019s  social\nwelfare  policies  over  many  years  have  resulted  in  high  levels  of  human  capital  and  relatively\nwidespread social well-being.\n\n                                                          \n2  Royal Government of Bhutan, Bhutan National Human Development Report 2000.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\n5. \n\nPoverty and Socioeconomic Profile in the Project Area\n\n11. \nAccording  to  the  socioeconomic  survey,  38  percent  of  the  households  are  below  the\nestimated  poverty  level  of  Bhutan.3  The  survey  shows  that  the  poor  are  more  likely  to  have\nlower education, have more children, have poorer house, lack of potable water, and have small\nland.\n\nThe  total  population  in  the  Project  area  is  68,437  and  85  percent  live  in  rural  areas.\n12. \nAgriculture  continues  to  be  the  main  source  of  livelihood.  Most  of  the  people  earn  their  living\nthrough farming, raising animals, and gathering forest products. About 90 percent are farmers\nwhile  approximately  15  percent  also  engage  in  off-farm  enterprises  including  retail  activities,\nhandicraft, and food products.\n\n13. \nLand  holdings  vary  in  size  from  zero  for  the  few  landless  people  to  around  25  acres;\nhowever,  the  average  holding  for  65  percent  of  the  people  has  is  2.0  acres.    From  the  focus\ngroup  discussion  conducted  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  size  of  land  holding  is  not  a\npredictor of income; depending on the mix of types of land, production and its value, the income\nderived from a plot will vary. Farmers with little land of their own will often sharecrop the land\nbelonging to others in return for half the crop so as to generate sufficient income.\n\n14. \nEmployment  opportunities  in  rural  Bhutan  are  restricted  to  work  as  a  civil  servant,  a\nteacher,  or  a  health  worker  in  the  basic  health  units  in  the  villages  or  as  a  village  headman.\nSome  of  the  landless  poor  run  small  shops  in  the  villages  as  one  of  their  survival  strategies.\nOccasional  day  labor  is  available  for  collecting  and  carrying  firewood  in  some  areas.  During\nharvest and planting seasons, often there is labor shortage in rural areas. Farming households\ntend  to  help  each  other  at  times  of  greatest  labor  need  and  reciprocate  to  fill  the  gaps  rather\nthan hire labor.\n\n15. \nOther land-poor families join the Department of Road (DOR) national work force (NWF)\nin constructing and maintaining roads or working for the few private road contractors. The road\nworkers  are  among  the  neediest  and  poorest  groups  in  the  country.  Illiteracy  and  insufficient\nland have forced them to leave their villages to join the workforce. They often are based in labor\ncamps along the road, with or without their families, and are solely there to maintain the road.\n\n6. \n\nGender and Poverty\n\n16.  Women in general are found to be more affected by poverty. This is largely due to the\ndiscrepancies that remain in important areas such as literacy and school enrolment particularly\nin  secondary  and  tertiary  education.  On  the  whole,  however,  Bhutanese  women  enjoy  a\nrelatively high status. For example, most women, inherit land, own livestock, and tend to play a\ncentral role in the family. Bhutanese law gives equal rights to women.\n\n17. \nAgriculture sector is a major employer of women, as 85 percent of the Bhutanese people\nare  entirely  dependent  on  subsistence  farming.  Women  play  multiple  roles  in  both  productive\nand reproductive activities. For women working in agriculture, estimates and anecdotal evidence\n                                                          \n3 \n\nSince no documented information on the poverty line of Bhutan is available, its assessment was based on the\nsame yardstick (primarily daily calorie intake food of 2,200 calorie per person per day) as that followed in India,\nadjusted  to  consider  nuances  relevant  to  Bhutan,  such  as  expenditure  on  transport,  shelter,  clothing,  fuel,  etc.\nThis is estimated to be around Nu504 per person per month or $144 per capita per year (December 1998 price\nlevel).\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nshow that their workload is higher than men\u2019s, largely because of their housekeeping and child\ncare  responsibilities.  In  addition,  the  surveys  indicate  that  10  percent  of  the  men  have  out-\nmigrated  to  join  traditional  religious  schools,  the  armed  forces,  and  other  services,  thus\nimposing  an  additional  burden  on  women  in  terms  of  work  and  responsibilities.  The  most\ndisadvantaged women are those who live in low-income households. Illiterate women are often\ncut out of economic activities such as trading, and are a particularly vulnerable group.\n\nB. \n\nStakeholder-Based Assessment of the Importance of the Project\n\n18. \nA  stakeholder-based  assessment  was  carried  out  as  part  of  social  assessment  to  gain\ninsights  into  the  existing  situation  of  stakeholders  and  to  determine  their  expectation  on  the\nimpact of the Project. The assessment was undertaken in eight village clusters along the East-\nWest Highway and with other key stakeholders in Thimphu, through focus group discussions.\n\n1.\n\nCommunity Perception of the Importance of the Project\n\nCommunity  members  expected  the  Project  would  lead  to  significant  improvements  in\n19. \nsocioeconomic conditions, with many existing constraints being reduced or overcome. The most\ncommonly  cited  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  improved  transportation  would  allow  farmers  to\ndiversify into higher value crops, such as fruit and green vegetables; (ii) reduced journey times\nwould  increase  tourist  visits,  and  seasonal  reductions  in  tourism  would  be  moderate;  and  (iii)\nimproved access to market would lead to the expansion of cottage and small industries. It was\nexpected that such improvements would contribute to improvements in living standards and the\nquality of life.\n\n20. \nThere was widespread consensus that the poor standard of transportation contributed to\nthe existing lack of employment opportunities and access to health, education, and other social\nservices, and that the Project would help improve economic prospects, living conditions and the\nquality of life. Examples of why stakeholders are looking forward to the project are sited here.\n\n21. \nRoad  Users  (passengers  and  drivers  of  motor  vehicles).  The  main  impact  of  the\nProject will be shorter travel time, reduced delays, higher travel speeds, increased comfort, and\nreduced vehicle operating costs (VOCs), which may translate into increased service frequency\nand lower fares.\n\n22. \nAccess to Markets. Timely access to markets, particularly during rainy season, is vital\nto the survival of the majority of households served by the East-West Highway. Cash crop sales\nare the major source of income in almost all rural households, supplemented by sale of woven\nhandicrafts  where  the  skills  exist  in  the  household.  Loss  of  income  from  crops  will  lead  the\nhousehold to poverty unless other sources are available.\n\n23. \nLabor  Force  Participation  and  Employment  Opportunity.  Communities  along  the\nEast-West Highway expect that the Project will lead to investment in new industries and service\nactivities  offering  more  attractive  sources  of  employment.  With  improved  access  to  markets,\nthey  expect  to  have  better  opportunities  for  operating  their  own  small  and  medium-scale\nenterprises. Moreover, the Project will create employment opportunity for the road workers, road\nsupervisors, engineers, and petty road contractors.\n\nFarmers  and  Agricultural  Producers.  Improvements  in  transportation  will  facilitate\n24. \naccess by rural people to markets in urban centers, and sellers of garden fruit and vegetables\nwill have more ready access to the markets. This is especially important for sellers of potatoes\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\nwhere delay in delivery can result in the crop loss. The seasonal nature of potato sales means\nthat loss of the crop will ruin the household financially. Furthermore, road improvements mean\nthat  Druk  Seeds  could  expand  its  marketing  activities  out  of  its  district  headquarters  in\nBumthang.  This  would  provide  farmers  greater  security  of  income,  and  reduce  the  risk  and\nefforts  required\u2013at  present,  to  hire  trucks  to  carry  the  crop  to  Phuentsholing  themselves\u2013and\nenable them to sell to the Indian export market.\n\n25. \nExtension  Workers.  Improved  access  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  extension\nworkers  in  reaching  communities  and  promoting  improved  technologies  and  inputs.  This  will\nhave  a  direct  impact  on  rural  production  and  income.  Currently  there  are  agricultural  and\nforestry extension workers based in the community along the East-West Highway.\n\nHealth  Services.  Improved  access  can  mean  increased  use  of  health  and  family\n26. \nplanning services. Health services are also better when access is easier. Road improvements\nwill facilitate movement of staff to the outreach clinics from the basic health units, permit timely\ndelivery  of  medical  supplies,  and  facilitate  access  to  the  services,  particularly  in  case  of\nemergencies. One of the most frequently mentioned concerns of rural villages was the difficulty\nof  accessing  emergency  care,  especially  in  the  monsoon  period  when  landslides  frequently\noccur.\n\nEducational  Facilities.  The  main  restraint  to  the  expanded  provision  of  education  is\n27. \nlack  of  trained  teachers.  Teachers,  particularly  women,  are  reluctant  to  accept  postings  in\nremote  areas  where  access  is  difficult  or  transport  services  are  minimum  and/or  expensive.\nParents are reluctant to send children to school where the travel time is prolonged. The Project\nwill reduce travel times and costs for teachers and pupils, and contribute to the expansion and\ntake-up of education services in the project areas.\n\n28. \nTourism. Improved roads will lead to an expansion of tourism with both foreigners and\nBhutanese  visitors.  Bumthang,  one  of  the  main  religious  places  of  the  country  receives\nnumerous  pilgrims  and  other  visitors.  Better  access  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  visitors  and\nexpansion  of  related-service  industries.  Similarly,  many  Bhutanese  travel  to  India  in  winter  to\nundertake  pilgrimages  in  Bihar.  Over  80  percent  of  religious  pilgrims  are  from  rural  areas.\nImproved access along the East-West Highway will enable more people to travel more easily for\nthese purposes.\n\n29. \nSocial  Benefits.  Improvements  to  the  transportation  system  and  network  have  social\nbenefits  for  families.  Communications  between  families  will  be  easier  and  they  will  be  able  to\nvisit each other more easily and more frequently. These are important benefits when people are\nposted all over the country for work, to attend schools and colleges, and where marriages often\noccur between people from different districts.\n\n2.\n\nBusiness Community Perception\n\n30. \nDuring  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  focus  group  discussions  to  assess  the  general\nperception of the business community in Thimphu and Wangdue-Phodrang on how the Project\nwould  benefit  private  sector  activities  indicated  strong  support  for  the  project.  In  general,  the\nprivate sector expects the Project to significantly improve the attractiveness of the east region\nfor business and private investment, and contribute to more rapid economic growth. The East-\nWest  Highway  will  enable  companies  to  make  use  of  the  region\u2019s  abundant  agricultural\nproducts,  natural  resources,  and  tourism  opportunities,  as  well  as  the  proximity  to  India.  Until\nnow, these advantages have been outweighed by lack of an efficient transport network.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 6\n\n31. \nLack  of  an  efficient  long-distance  transport  has  been  a  major  constraint  on  private\nenterprise  development  in  the  east  region.  It  was  a  source  of  multiple,  mutually  reinforcing\ndisadvantages.  Businesses  whose  inputs  and/or  outputs  were  perishable  faced  unacceptable\nlevels of spoilage and could not attract premium prices. Lack of reliable transportation precluded\ncertain types of agricultural products that were subject to strict delivery schedules. The business\ncommunity expects the Project to significantly reduce these constraints.\n\nThe business community claims improved transportation will help increase the scale and\n32. \nraise the profitability of private activities. Businesses will gain access to better priced domestic\nand export markets, enjoy reduced input costs, and be able to improve productivity. Among the\nmain areas of private sector activities that will benefit are agriculture, tourism, cottage and small\nindustries,  and  supporting  services.  The  private  sector  believes  the  Project  will  contribute  to\nattracting domestic and foreign investment and international tourism, not only in the project area\nbut also throughout Bhutan.\n\n3. \n\nPerception of a No\u2013Project Scenario\n\n33. \nFocus  group  discussions  with  key  stakeholders  such  as  government  staff,  business\ncommunity, and direct beneficiaries indicate that none of the positive benefits would occur if the\nworks  did  not  take  place.  Two  main  reasons  are  mentioned:  (i)  Income  generation  would  not\nincrease  if  the  road  quality  declines.  Increased  transport  delay  would  cause  rural  incomes  to\ndecline. For the majority of farm households in the project area, this would lead to a significant\nincrease  in  poverty.  (ii)  Increased  difficulty  of  travel  would  increase  reliance  on  the  routes  via\nIndia, which will increase transportation transportation.\n\nThe summary of beneficiary assessments of the with- and without-project scenarios are\n\n34. \nas follows.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 7\n\nTable A13: Beneficiary Perception of the Project\n\nType of Beneficiary\n\nWith Project\n\nWithout Project\n\nConsultation\nMethod\n\n1.

Under the new project classification effective 2001, the Project would be classified\nas pro-poor growth. The Project will approach poverty reduction in at least three ways: (i) pro-\npoor  growth,  (ii)  improved  quality  of  life,  and  (iii)  employment  opportunities  for  the  poorest\npopulation of the country.\n\n1. \n\nPro-Poor Growth\n\n36.  More  rapid  economic  development  is  expected  to  significantly  reduce  in  poverty\nhinterland  and  eastern  regions.  Existing  poverty  is  rooted  in  lack  of  economic  activities,\nsufficient  employment  opportunities,  and  livelihood  activities.  Survey  data  on  occupational\ndistribution suggests that many of the poor in the project area are engaged casual labor; or work\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 13, page 9\n\nin  agriculture,  cottage  industries,  and  construction;  or  are  unemployed.  The  expected\ndiversification  of  agriculture  and  expansion  of  potentially  better  paying  employment  in  small\nindustries and tourism are likely to have especially significant poverty reduction impacts.\n\nFor farmers in general, the improved transport network can also ease the introduction of\n37. \nmodern  farming  practices  and  the  transition  from  subsistence  farming  to  cash  crops  and  a\nmarket economy. Better and reliable access can also lower the costs of inputs such as fertilizer\nand stimulate higher cash crop farming production and more stable incomes, enabling the poor\nto improve their management of risks. The Project will benefit the urban population as well. For\nexample, a reduction in food prices for the urban poor can be achieved.\n\n2.\n\nImproved Quality of Life\n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  have  direct  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  of  all  income  groups.\nImprovements on the East-West Highway not only provide people with more convenient access\nto  a  broad  range  of  socioeconomic  opportunities,  but  also  have  a  strong  income  effect  by\nlowering transport costs and hence the prices of consumer goods and services. Therefore, it will\ncontribute to improving personal welfare. Moreover, lack of affordable access deprives the poor\nof opportunity to take advantage of jobs and even of very basic social services. Reliable access\nto schools and health services will enable the poor to accumulate human capital, which is a key\nfactor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n\n3. \n\nEmployment Opportunities for the Poor\n\nThe Project will generate a demand for labor (often unskilled labor) and provide income-\n39. \nearning  opportunities  for  the  poor.  It  will  enable  the  privatized  road  contractors  to  provide\nemployment  opportunities  for  the  local  community.  This  could  be  of  particular  value  to\nhouseholds with very small plots and/or few animals and who have to sharecrop other farmers\u2019\nland,  or  who  have  time  available.  Since  the  Project  will  generate  jobs  for  the  poor  who  are\notherwise unemployed or underemployed, it will contribute to poverty reduction.\n\n40. \nThe Project will also directly benefit the road workers. In the project area are 2,748 road\nworkers\u201340  percent  are  women\u2013who  are  paid  by  DOR.  They  are  among  the  neediest  and\npoorest groups in the country. Their average salary is Nu1,500 per month and their families live\nwith them. On the average, each family has four children. The Project will be implemented by\nthe private contractors, which will hire the bulk of the road workers. Private firms pay their road\nlaborers an average Nu2,700 per month, which is Nu1,200 higher than the DOR rates and will\ndefinitely decrease poverty among the road workers.\n\nD.\n\nGender Impact\n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  negative  impact  on  gender  relations.  Women  will  benefit\nthrough  their  participation  in  roadwork  opportunities,  mainly  drainage  and  slope  protection\nactivities.  Since  women  in  Bhutan  are  active  producers  and  marketers  of  food,  reducing  the\ntransport impediments of rural women would release their time and energy for more productive\nand  socially  beneficial  activities.  The  Project  will  facilitate  access  to  existing  health,  social\nservices,  and  schools;  enable  teachers,  of  whom  the  majority  are  women,  to  commute  from\nurban centers to village schools; and permit district administrators to establish new schools and\nrecruit more teachers. The enrollment rates will increase for both boys and girls, but the rate for\ngirls, which has been much lower than for boys might increase more.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 13, page 10\n\nE.\n\nLocal Labor\n\n42. \nFor  road  improvements,  the  Government  will  encourage  private  contractors  to  employ\nlocal labor instead of imported labor from India and Nepal. This will be closely monitored during\nsupervision, with attention to the specific contractual clauses incorporated in the sample bidding\ndocuments. Any negative impact on groups and individuals will be identified and mitigated. For\nexample, the use of child labor in construction activities is not allowed. Close monitoring during\nsupervision  will  pay  attention  to  the  specific  contractual  clauses  incorporated  in  the  sample\nbidding documents.\n\nF.\n\nParticipatory Approach\n\nThe  participatory  approach  was  used  during \n\n43. \ntechnical\nassistance, Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions to understand poverty from the perspective of\na range of stakeholders, particularly poor women and men, and to involve them in the planning\nfor follow-up action. The social assessment aims to inform the affected people about the Project\nand its implications, and elicit their suggestions, views on mitigation measures, and the role they\ncould  play.  The  local  community,  particularly  the  poor,  will  be  informed  and  encouraged  to\nparticipate  in  road  improvement  and  maintenance  activities  where  their  participation  will  be\nmaximized.\n\nthe  project  preparatory \n\n44. \nA  participatory  gender  assessment  of  the  well-being  of  women  road  workers  was\nconducted.4  A  survey  was  carried  out  along  the  East-West  Highway.  Direct  generation  of\nprimary  data  through  participatory  gender  assessment  and  survey  will  produce  the  baseline\ninformation  to  determine  gender  ratio,  working  conditions,  effectiveness  of  the  World  Food\nProgram, social and welfare facilities available, and the constraints and opportunities to improve\ntheir  working  conditions  and  livelihood.  The  analysis  of  policies  on  labor  and  the  national\nworkforce,  and  other  secondary  data  will  supplement  this  participatory  assessment.  An  initial\nstakeholder  survey  was  conducted  during  Appraisal  Mission  aimed  at  increasing  key\nstakeholders\u2019  awareness  of  the  importance  of  improving  the  well-being  of  road  workers  and\nassessing stakeholders input on issues that need to be addressed during the assessment.\n\nG.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n45. \nThe  Project  does  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  as  the  works  to  be\nundertaken will be confined to resurfacing within the existing right-of-way. The Ministry of Home\nAffairs Rules and Regulations state that no one is permitted to construct or erect or install any\nkind of house, fences within 50 feet on either side of the road. The walkover survey along the\nEast-West Highway found that there are no squatters within the right-of-way. Since there will be\nno land acquisition and resettlement in this Project, a land acquisition and resettlement plan is\nnot needed.\n\n                                                          \n4\n\nUnder TA 5889-REG: Gender and Development Initiatives, for $850,000, approved on 13 December 1999\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 13, page 11\n\nH.\n\nImpact on Indigenous People and Cultural Properties\n\n46.\nData  from  the  social  assessment  and  other  available  documents  show  no  separate\ndisadvantaged groups who are likely to be adversely affected by the Project. Accordingly, there\nis  no  need  to  prepare  an  indigenous  people  development  plan.  Also,  the  Project  will  not\nadversely  affect  any  cultural  property.  In  fact,  the  Project  will  facilitate  access  to  some  of  the\nhighly revered spiritual centers in Bhutan.\n\nI.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring System (PPMS)\n\n47.\nDuring  project  implementation,  DOR,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  carry\nout  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  activities  under  arrangements  satisfactory\nto ADB to ensure efficient management of project activities and maximization of project benefits.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  performance  indicators  (Appendix  10)  for\ncarrying  out  these  PPMS  activities.  The  findings  and  supporting  data  will  be  incorporated  into\nthe project performance monitoring and evaluation report for the completed Project. Community-\nbased  organizations  in  the geog,5  in  association  with  the  DOR,  will  verify  the  effectiveness  of\nproject activities and outputs, as well as the reactions of the intended beneficiaries. A sociologist\non the consulting team will assist DOR with that task. The project performance and monitoring\nevaluation  will  allow  postevaluation  of  the  Project,  and  also  improve  planning  for  future  road\nimprovement projects.\n\n                                                          \n5 \n\nA geog is a cluster of villages.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 August 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\n", "Ngultrum (Nu)\n", "\u2013\n", "=\n=\n", "Nu1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.023\nNu44.20\n", "In this report, an exchange rate of $1.00 = Rs43 is used.\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\ndouble bituminous surface treatment\nDepartment of Roads\neconomic internal rate of return\nequivalent standard axle\ngross domestic product\ngross national product\ngross vehicle weight\nHighway Design and Maintenance Model\nIndian Border Roads Organization\ninitial environmental examination\nMinistry of Communications\nProject Management Office\nnet present value\nProject Performance Monitoring System\nSpecial Drawing Rights\ntechnical assistance\nvehicle operating cost\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ADB\nDBST\nDOR\nEIRR\nESA\nGDP\nGNP\nGVW\nHDM\nIBRO\nIEE\nMOC\nPMO\nNPV\nPPMS\nSDR\nTA\nVOC\n", "NOTES\n", "(i)\n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
