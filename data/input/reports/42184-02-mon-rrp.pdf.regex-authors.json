Initial environmental examinations were prepared for all \nAssessment  part  B  activities  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n   \nProject Description  Part A will finance consulting services to support (i) infrastructure \nservices  reforms  including  performance-based  contracts  for  urban \nservices delivery, (ii) institutional development and capacity building \nto strengthen urban planning and policy making, (iii) strengthening of \nregional  cooperation,  and  (iv)  project  management  and  project \nperformance monitoring. \n \nPart B will finance priority infrastructure improvements and physical \noutputs including (i) water source development, water transmission, \nstorage, and distribution network, allowing increased connections to \npiped  water  supply  and  reducing  system  leakage;  (ii)  increased \nwastewater  collection  coverage  and  enhanced  capacity  for \nwastewater treatment and effluent reuse; (iii) improved efficiency and \ncoverage  of  district  heating  services;  (iv)  improved  storm  water \ndrainage; (v) surfaced central road networks; and (vi) development of \ncontrolled solid-waste landfills and enhanced capacity for solid-waste \ncollection. \n   \nRationale  The  aimags  (provinces)  of  Omnogovi  and  Dornogovi  (Southeast \nGobi) are poised to experience a rapid increase in economic activity \nas a result of rapid growth in mining and cross-border trade. The \ninflux associated with these economic activities is projected to more \nthan double urban populations in the project towns by 2020. For some \nsoum (district) centers in Southeast Gobi, population is expected to \nincrease by an order of magnitude by 2020.  \n \nThe provision of urban infrastructure and services is currently poor \nand is not keeping pace with population growth. Many services are \neither inadequate or absent. There are low levels of access to water \nsupply and sanitation, and smaller urban areas do not have piped \nnetworks. Insufficient and unreliable urban services add to business \nand household costs, damage the urban environment and diminish \nquality of life, and decrease the attractiveness of towns to further ", "ii \n \npotential  investment.  Investment  and  capacity  development  are \nrequired to enable government to expand the coverage and improve \nthe quality and reliability of urban services. Local governments are ill-\nequipped to meet the joint challenges posed by increased demand for \nscarce water resources. \n \nMaximizing the benefits to existing and future residents of Southeast \nGobi  from  mining  investments,  trade  growth,  and  associated \neconomic  development  opportunities  depends  on  effective  urban \nplanning, management, and service delivery policies and structures \nbeing in place. Strengthening the provision of basic urban services \nwill  require  institutions  and  policies  that  provide  incentives  for \nperformance while also ensuring affordability. Services are currently \nprovided by utilities that are largely owned by local government, and \nare  delivered  at  a  loss  due  to  unwillingness  of  local  government \ncouncils to raise tariffs to cost-recovery levels. This is costly in terms \nof  the  resources  spent  on  untargeted  subsidies  and  foregone \nopportunities to attract private sector expertise and financing. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the project will be enhanced economic development \nand  livability  in  aimag  centers  and  mining  and  border  towns  in \nSoutheast Gobi. The outcome of the project will be improved urban \ngovernance, and expanded access to sustainable infrastructure and \nservices in urban places in Southeast Gobi. \n   \nProject Investment  The total cost of the project is estimated at $21.9 million equivalent, \nPlan   including duties and taxes of about $1.99 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing Plan \n($ million) \nTotal \nSource  Cost  %\nAsian Development Bank   15.0  68.6\nGovernment of Mongolia  6.8  30.9\nAimag governments  0.1  0.5\nTotal  21.9  100.0\n \nADB will provide a grant of $15 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources to cover 68.6% of the total project cost.

A domestic contribution of $6.90 \nmillion  equivalent  is  required,  which  will  comprise  $6.80 million \nequivalent from the Government of Mongolia and $0.1 million in-kind \nfrom the participating aimag governments.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The project will be implemented over 4.5 years beginning in June \n2010. The period of utilization will be up to 31 May 2015.  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 November 2014 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban ", "iii \n \nDevelopment (MRTCUD) \n   \nImplementation  The MRTCUD will be the executing agency, supported by a project \nArrangements  management unit (PMU) headed by a project director. The MRTCUD \nwill be responsible for strategic guidance, technical supervision and \nexecution,  and  ensuring  compliance  with  grant  covenants. \nImplementation of the priority infrastructure development component \n(part  B)  will  be  carried  out  by  the  aimag  governments.  Project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will be established in each aimag and will \nbe responsible for day-to-day implementation of physical works. The \nMRTCUD will coordinate the activities of the two PIUs at the aimag \nlevel through consultants and PMU staff, and will facilitate processing \nand approvals of designs, contracts, and other documents as required \nat ministry level. The project director, supported by the PMU and \nconsultants,  will  coordinate  all  activities  under  the  project  and  be \nresponsible for overall project execution, monitoring, and supervision. \n \nA project steering committee will be established with full powers to \ntake  decisions  on  matters  relating  to  project  implementation.  The \nproject director will be the member secretary of the project steering \ncommittee,  which  will  be  chaired  by  the  state  secretary  of  the \nMRTCUD. Members of the committee will include the chair of the \nState Property Committee; chair of the National Development and \nInnovation Committee; director of the Budget Policy Department of \nthe Ministry of Finance; and representatives of the Ministry of Nature, \nEnvironment and Tourism, Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, \nthe  MRTCUD,  and  the  aimag  governments  of  Dornogovi  and \nOmnogovi. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  financed  from  the  ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be \napplied  to  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  more. \nSupply contracts with a value less than $500,000 will follow national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB), and those less than $100,000 will follow \nshopping procedures as reflected by particular circumstances of the \ncontract packages. ICB will be used for civil works contracts valued at \n$1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued at less than $1 million \nbut more than $100,000 will be procured using NCB procedures. The \nselection  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval. Before commencement of NCB procurement, ADB and the \nrecipient will review the recipient\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  modifications  or \nclarifications to the recipient\u2019s procedures will be documented in the \nprocurement plan. Any internationally tendered equipment packages \nwill  include  the  technical  support  for  ensuring  proper  installation, \ntesting, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part of the \nrelated  contracts.  In  accordance  with  ADB  requirements,  foreign \ncontractors may participate in bidding for NCB contracts.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and \n ", "iv \n \ncost-based  selection  procedures,  consultant  qualification  selection, \nand/or  individual  consultant  selection  procedures.  The  project  will \nrequire a total of about 80 person-months of international and 350 \nperson-months of national consulting services to support (i) the PMU \nand  PIUs  in  project  implementation  and  management; \n(ii) development  of  structure  plans  for  all  project  towns;  (iii)  an \nimproved  institutional  and  incentive  framework  for  urban  service \ndelivery; (iv) improved local government capacity for urban planning, \nland  management  system  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance; \n(v) enhanced cost recovery from services through metering and tariff \nreform; and (vi) improved local government revenues and financial \nmanagement  through  the  establishment  of  predictable  recurrent \nfinancing  and  performance-based  contracting  and  private  sector \nparticipation.  \n \nThe  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project \nmanagement  and  procurement  (including  performance-based \ncontracting),  urban  and  regional  planning,  financial  management, \ninstitutional  and  organizational  development,  and  capacity  building \nand training. The national consultants will have expertise in water and \nwastewater  engineering,  resettlement,  environmental  management, \nlegal  aspects,  database  development,  financial  management,  and \nconstruction supervision and engineering design. The consultants will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ninternational  consultants  and  the  national  consultants  for  project \nmanagement  will  be  selected  and  contracted  individually. \nInternational and national consultants for developing service lease \nagreements  and  contract  preparation,  urban  planning  reform,  and \nreference design and preparing tender documents for design-and-\nbuild contracts will be selected and contracted as firms using ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  among  short-listed \ninternational and national consulting firms.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The project will directly benefit about 100,000 people in six towns in \nBeneficiaries  Omnogovi and Dornogovi aimags, of whom approximately 30.7% live \nbelow  the  poverty  line.  The  project  components  have  strong \neconomic rationale since they provide minimum acceptable standards \nfor basic living conditions and assist in removing existing constraints \non  social  development  and  economic  growth.  Similarly,  priority \ninfrastructure improvements were designed in accordance with sound \nprinciples based on need, consultation and targeting, and demand \nmanagement.  The  project  supports  rehabilitation  before  new \ninvestment,  and  infrastructure  improvements  represent  technically \nfeasible options at least cost. There will be qualitative improvement in \nthe  lives  of  the  communities,  in  particular  those  living  in  ger \n(traditional felt tent) areas. Living conditions will improve at individual \nand  communal  levels  due  to  improved  health  and  reduced  water \ncollection times. The benefits are disproportionately directed toward \nwomen who bear most of the burden associated with poor service \ndelivery.  Women  will  also  benefit  from  employment  opportunities ", "v \n \nduring construction, and enhanced roles in local governance. \n   \nRisks and  The 2008 joint country portfolio performance review and a 2008 risk \nAssumptions  assessment for the education and urban infrastructure sectors noted \nthe key sector risks as poor capital investment and budget planning, \nunderdeveloped institutional frameworks and poor capacity, lack of \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  poor  procurement  integrity,  and  weak \nnational contractors. The proposed project addresses these risks by \n(i)  building  national  and  local  government  investment  planning \ncapacity, (ii) building the capacity of local service institutions with \nincreased  private  sector  participation,  (iii)  focusing  institutional \nchange on measuring and improving service delivery performance, \n(iv) adopting a design-and-build modality for procurement of priority \ninfrastructure improvements to attract better-qualified contractors, and \n(v)  combining  individual  civil  works  activities  into  larger  contract \npackages to generate economies of scale and create packages that \nare eligible for ICB.  \n \nIt  is  assumed  that  anticipated  demand  for  urban  infrastructure \nservices in the project towns will materialize, mining developments \nwill continue, and major mining companies will remain committed to \nforms  of  mine  development  that  support  urban  development  in \nneighboring  towns.  It  is  further  assumed  that  government  policy \ncontinues to allow free movement of people to the project areas. \n \nGovernment policies on public\u2013private partnerships for the provision \nof  municipal  services  are  central  to  project  sustainability  and \noutcomes. It is assumed that proposed reforms to service delivery \ninstitutions  in  aimag  and  soum  centers  will  be  supported,  and \ncontracts for operation of municipal services will proceed and will be \nsupported  by  a  viable  independent  regulatory  mechanism.  It  is \nassumed that the domestic private sector will participate in operation \nmanagement contracts for service delivery.  \n \nThe project does not have any particular technical risks. Conventional \nengineering designs with proven records of reliable performance are \nadopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  solid-waste \nmanagement,  and  roads.  The  proposed  packaging  of  priority \ninfrastructure improvements under part B will provide for contracts \nthat qualify for ICB and attract better-qualified contractors. \n ", "96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nMONGOLIA\nSOUTHEAST GOBI\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\nURBAN AND BORDER TOWN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nHanh\n50 o 00'N 50 o 00'N\nUlaanbayshint Ulaangom Hatgal\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Nogoonnuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Uliastay Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor Lun ULAANBAABTaAgRanuur Batnorov\nDariv TOV Nalayh\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg Zuunmod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad Tamsagbulag\nYarant Harhorin GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nTogrog Buutsagaan Arvayheer Erdenetsagaan\nBichigt\nMandalgovi\nNariynteel SUHBAATAR\nGOVI-ALTAY\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nSaynshand\nTsogt-Ovoo\nDORNOGOVI\nZamyn-Uud\nDalanzadgad Tsogttsetsii\nGurvantes\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Hanbogd Project Aimag 42 o 00'N\nBayan-Ovoo Project Town\nGashuun Suhayt National Capital\nAimag Capital\nN City/Town\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nMain Road\nOF  CHINA \nProvincial Road\n0 50 100150200250 Railway\nRiver\nKilometers Aimag Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0\n9-4 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n6\n7\n8 H 96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Mongolia for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The aimags (provinces) of Omnogovi and Dornogovi (Southeast Gobi) are poised to \nexperience a rapid increase in economic activity as a result of (i) planned development of new \nmines at Tavan Tolgoi, Oyu Tolgoi, and Tsagaan Suvarga; (ii) expansion of existing mining \noperations at Naryn Suhayt and Ovoo Tolgoi and other locations; (iii) development of associated \npower stations and transport infrastructure; and (iv) strengthening of trade corridors with the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) through the border town at Zamyn-Uud in Dornogovi, and \nthrough crossing points of Gashuun Suhayt and Shivee Huren in Omnogovi, and Hangi in \nDornogovi.  \n \n3.  The influx associated with these economic activities is projected to more than double \nurban populations in the project towns by 2020. For some soum1 centers in Southeast Gobi \n(notably Hanbogd and Tsogttsetsii), population is expected to increase about tenfold by 2020. \nThe population of Zamyn-Uud, currently at about 10,000, is expected to more than double by \n2020. \n \n4.  Effective urban infrastructure and services are prerequisites for sustainable economic \ngrowth. In the urban areas of Southeast Gobi, many services are either inadequate or absent. \nThe population has low levels of access to water supply and sanitation, and the smaller urban \nareas do not have piped networks. Reticulated water supply networks and sewerage systems \nserve only the formal areas of the aimag centers and Zamyn-Uud soum; the majority of the \npopulation in these towns lives in ger (traditional felt tent) areas and do not benefit from network \nservices (except through water kiosks). In other soum centers, water is only available from well \npoints, and there are no sewerage systems. \n \n5.  Strengthening the provision of basic urban services will require institutions and policies \nthat provide incentives for performance while also ensuring affordability. Services are currently \nprovided by utilities that are largely owned by local government, and are delivered at a loss due \nto unwillingness of local government councils to raise tariffs to cost-recovery levels. This is \ncostly in terms of resources spent on untargeted subsidies and foregone opportunities to attract \nprivate sector expertise and financing. The government is developing legislation that will enable \nefficient delivery of municipal services, introducing accountability and independent regulation. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided technical assistance for preparing legislation \non public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The proposed project will support these reforms. \n \n6.  Less than 30% of the urban population has adequate water service, and only 17% has \naccess to adequate sanitation services. The daily household water consumption in ger areas is \n5\u201310 liters per capita per day (lpcd), much less than the minimum of 25 lpcd recommended by \n                                                 \n1 A soum is the administrative unit immediately below an aimag (province). Each aimag comprises a number of \nsoums, at the center of which is a soum center\u2014comprising several administrative buildings and a small population.  ", "2   \nthe  World  Health  Organization.  There  are  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for  water  from  the \nnetworks (about 40% of water produced).  \n \n7.  Economic developments are set to take place in a sparsely populated and largely poor \narea. The aimags of Dornogovi and Omnogovi are located within the central region, which \ncontains significant numbers of poor households. In Omnogovi, where disaggregated data are \navailable, the percentage of households living below the poverty line in Dalanzadgad is 21%\u2013\n26%, in Hanbogd soum it is estimated at 15%\u201325%, and in Tsogttsetsii soum it is 13%\u201326%. \nHouseholds headed by women are more likely to be poor, and form a significant proportion of \nthe total households living below the poverty line in Southeast Gobi.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  Rapid population growth. Southeast Gobi is set to experience rapid growth in its urban \npopulation. In Omnogovi, the mining sector could require up to 7,000 new employees by 2015 \nand  an  additional  10,000  by  2020.  Many  mine  workers  and  their  families,  small  business \nowners, and others attracted to this high-growth area will locate outside mine fences in existing \nurban settlements. The major mining companies support a mixed model of operations whereby \nsome employees are transported in and out of the mine site from afar, while others live in \nnearby settlements. The population at the three border-crossing points of Gashuun Suhayt and \nShivee Huren in Omnogovi, and Hangi in Dornogovi is expected to grow quickly. In Dornogovi, \nthe cross-border trade with the PRC at the Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erlian rail crossing point has been \nincreasing at a rate of 26% per year in recent years. The completion of the Ulaanbaatar to \nZamyn-Uud road link and planned investments in logistics facilities at Zamyn-Uud will serve to \nsignificantly increase cross-border trade and result in a population influx.  \n \n9.  Uncoordinated framework for subregional development. Efforts to reach a clear \npolicy and strategic framework for the future development of the urban sector in Southeast Gobi \nare compromised by institutional fragmentation and a lack of consensus across government \ndepartments and other stakeholders. The National Development and Innovation Committee \n(NDIC)  and  the  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban  Development \n(MRTCUD) are carrying out work on aspects of the subregional strategy. The MRTCUD is in the \nprocess of finalizing a development plan for the Gobi region covering Omnogovi, Dornogovi, \nand Dundgovi aimags, while simultaneously undergoing reorganization in an attempt to better \nalign  its  functions  to  the  requirements  of  the  sector.  The  prioritization  and  sequencing  of \ninvestment remains unclear, and many proposals under consideration have not identified any \nimmediate  or  future  source  of  funding.  The  government  expects  to  establish  a  regional \ndevelopment council to coordinate investments in Omnogovi and possibly other aimags. \n \n10.  Poor urban planning. Translating economic activity and population growth into real \nbenefits for residents of Southeast Gobi will depend on the development of livable urban places. \nThis, in turn, requires effective urban planning and a framework for the provision of high-quality \nmunicipal services. The project will address these needs by supporting priority investments, \ninstitutional  reform,  and  capacity  development.  The  aimag  and  soum  centers  are  poorly \nequipped to deal with the impact that rapid growth from mining and trade will have on their \nplanning systems, infrastructure, and services. Although master plans have been prepared for \nsome of the project towns, these are based on past natural population growth trends and do not \naccommodate the populations now anticipated as a result of the projected influx. It is unclear \nhow  proposed  investments  will  be  financed,  and  the  institutional  strengthening,  capacity \nbuilding, and reform needed to ensure that the plans are effectively executed and services are \nwell managed have not been addressed. \n ", "  3\n \n11.  The rapid allocation of land for khashaas (land plots) based on the Law on the Allocation \nof Land to Mongolian Citizens has resulted in land being allocated in a way that bears little \nrelation to the provisions of town master plans.2 Demands for land for housing and commercial \nuses are increasing rapidly and are overwhelming the capacity of local governments to deal \neffectively with them, resulting in poorly planned development and adding to the eventual costs \nof servicing developments. Competing and conflicting land uses and the limited amount of \ndevelopable land in Zamyn-Uud is already resulting in major development challenges, which will \nbe repeated in the other high-growth towns unless better tools and systems are put in place.  \n \n12.  Constrained local resources. The aimag governments of Southeast Gobi, in common \nwith those elsewhere in the country, lack fiscal autonomy. In a system set out in the 2003 Public \nSector Management and Finance Law, aimag government revenues comprise taxes decided by \nthe assemblies, shared taxes, and nontax revenues. Aimag governments have few revenue-\nraising powers; local taxes, corporate income tax, and excises, which were shared before 2003, \nare now retained by the central government. Value-added tax is shared, but the proportion is \ndecided annually by the central government. All taxes are collected by the General Department \nfor National Taxation and then transferred to subnational governments. Local governments \nrequire regular and predictable income to cover establishment and operational costs and to \nprovide funding for local development. A more formalized allocation process that is transparent, \nsustainable, and predictable is required.  \n \n13.  Struggling service institutions. Aimag-owned urban services companies, called public \nurban service organizations (PUSOs),3 have difficulty maintaining existing levels of service and \nare not in a position to expand service coverage to meet expected demand for services and \ninfrastructure. They are guided in part by management contracts with the aimag, which describe \ngeneral responsibilities but lack specificity on service quality and coverage, dispute resolution, \nand remuneration. Soum governments have departments (mini-PUSOs) that are responsible for \nsmall-scale heating and water operations. The PUSOs and mini-PUSOs struggle to recover \noperating and maintenance costs and lack access to training and managerial expertise. The \nmost  fundamental  constraint  is low  tariffs;  PUSO  requests  for  increases  to  enable  routine \noperating and maintenance costs to be recovered are often rejected by the aimag Citizens' \nRepresentatives  Khural4 due  to  the  political  unpopularity  of  such  adjustments.5 Under  the \nproposed project there is an opportunity to introduce a new arrangement for tariff formulation, \nwhereby they are set through competitively awarded contracts with the private sector and \nregulated by a central independent body.  \n  \n14.  Operational performance of institutions responsible for delivering urban services varies \nbut is generally characterized by low levels of access, inefficiency, and deficiencies in quality. \nFor example, less than one-third of the population in the project towns has access to household \nwater supply and district heating. The daily household water consumption in ger areas is 5\u201310 \nlpcd, much less than the 25 lpcd minimum recommended by the World Health Organization. \nWater losses are very high, estimated at 20%\u201340% of water produced, and energy losses from \n                                                 \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2003. Law on the Allocation of Land to Mongolian Citizens. Ulaanbaatar, revised 2008. \n3  The PUSO of Dornogovi is entirely owned by the aimag government, while that of Omnogovi is 51% owned by \naimag government and 49% by the private sector. \n4  The Citizens' Representative Khural is the parliamentary body at the aimag level. \n5  The Dornogovi aimag PUSO cross-subsidizes water and sanitation service using revenues from the district heating \nservice; the Omnogovi PUSO does the same using revenues from other business activities. The PUSOs also \ncross-subsidize between customer groups, charging institutional or ger customers more than the cost of service so \nas to subsidize household customers. \n ", "4   \nheating systems are estimated at 40% or more. Although water quality is generally good, raw \nwater  often  has  a  high  mineral  content.  There  are  also  reported  health  problems  due  to \ncontamination  from  pit  latrines  or  leaking  sewerage  lines.  Sewage  is  often  left  untreated. \nStaffing levels in the PUSOs are much higher than what would be expected at an efficiently \nmanaged water, heating, and sanitation utility. \n \n15.  The project presents an opportunity to introduce fundamental changes to the institutional \nframework for municipal service provision and its regulation. Recent technical assistance from \nADB has yielded recommendations, developed in cooperation with SPC, MRTCUD, and the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), including (i) divesting all or part of PUSOs so as to decouple service \nproviders from local government administration and attract private capital and expertise; (ii) \nintroducing  a  lease  contract  that  provides  performance-based  incentives  for  the  service \nprovider; and (iii) establishing a regulatory mechanism at a central level, which links tariffs with \nthe prices of key inputs, avoids political involvement in tariff setting, and reduces the regressive \nnature of the current tariff structure whereby residents of formal areas pay less than their \nneighbors in ger areas. These steps will be supported under the project, with a view to driving \nchanges in other aimags over time. \n \n16.  Inadequate infrastructure and service provision. The quality, coverage, and reliability \nof urban services within the project aimag and soum centers vary widely. Less than 30% of \nurban  households  within  the  aimags  have  access  to  household  water  supply  and  district \nheating. Still less have access to sanitary sewerage. The ger areas in the aimag centers and in \nZamyn-Uud rely on water from water kiosks and on-plot sanitation, and the low levels of water \nconsumption and poor sanitation increase the risk of waterborne and water-washed diseases. In \nthe other soum centers, there are no piped water supply and wastewater systems; all residents \nrely on wells and pit latrines. \n \n17.  Solid-waste collection management and disposal systems are generally nonexistent or \nat best rudimentary in the aimag and soum centers. It is estimated that less than 50% of the \npopulation is served by a regular garbage collection system, including some handled by small \nprivate operators engaged by the soum governments. No secure sanitary landfills exist, and the \nsolid waste collected is disposed of onto open sites. This causes pollution through the spreading \nof waste. Wind-blown plastic bags are becoming a feature of the Gobi Desert landscape.  \n \n18.  The absence of an extensive paved road network in the aimag centers and any paved \nroads at all in most of the soum centers prevents clear definition of rights of way and major \ncirculation routes. The dust which is generated by vehicles riding on the unpaved dirt roads \ncontributes to air pollution and has a negative impact on quality of life. \n \n19.  Underinvestment in infrastructure, and shortcomings in its operation and maintenance, \nraises costs for businesses and restricts access to jobs and services. There are significant \ndisparities in the level of services provided in formal planned areas in these towns and the \nadjacent  ger  areas.  The  urban  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  inadequate  provision, \nmanagement, and maintenance of urban infrastructure. They are exposed to risks associated \nwith deficient service provision; they lack adequate means to avoid the effects of poor water \nsupply,  inadequate  sanitation,  and  insufficient  heating,  and  are  the  most  severely \ndisadvantaged by the absence of suitable roads. The poor stand to benefit significantly from \nimproved infrastructure and service provision.  \n \n20.  Poor  cross-border  cooperation.  The  potential  benefits  of  close  cross-border \ncooperation  are  compromised  by  the  lack  of  effective  cross-border  institutions  and  an \n ", "  5\nassociated lack of investment on the Mongolian side. Action is required to narrow the gaps in \ntrade  logistics  and  urban  infrastructure  development  as  well  as  in  the  associated  trade \nprocesses. The unevenness of development is contributing to delays which are to the detriment \nof growth in cross-border trade. As delays occur, higher trade-related transaction costs worsen \nthe opportunity to handle increasing volumes of trade and there is less incentive for investment. \n \n21.  Prior external assistance. Several development partners are active in the urban sector \nin Mongolia, notably the World Bank (integrated urban development, ger area development, and \nurban air quality), Japan International Cooperation Agency (water supply, and urban planning \nand  transport  in  Ulaanbaatar),  and  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  (urban \nenvironment  and  energy  efficiency).  The  World  Bank  prepared  the  Southern  Mongolia \nInfrastructure Strategy6 in 2008\u20132009, which focused on infrastructure and institutional needs in \nOmnogovi  and  brought  stakeholders  together  to  discuss  these.  It  is  preparing  a  technical \nassistance project that will strengthen groundwater monitoring and support development of \ntransactions for private sector participation in infrastructure. Appendix 3 provides more details \non development coordination in the sector.  \n \n22.  ADB is supporting several ongoing and planned activities in Southeast Gobi. About \n$1.3 million  has  been  expended  on  rehabilitating  urban  services  in  Saynshand  and \nDalanzadgad. More than $1 million has been invested in Omnogovi aimag and $0.5 million in \nDornogovi  aimag  for  rehabilitating  schools,  providing  textbooks  and  tool  kits,  and  training \nteachers;  and  $1.3  million  has  been  invested  in  Dornogovi  aimag  for  rehabilitating  and \nconstructing aimag and soum hospitals, capacity building and training, and providing medical \nequipment and motorbikes. In 2009, an advisory technical assistance project began supporting \nHIV/AIDS prevention in ADB infrastructure projects and the mining sector. An ADB-financed \nproject preparatory technical assistance project is currently supporting the development of the \nRegional  Logistics  Development  Project  for  trade  logistics  facilities  at  Zamyn-Uud,  and \nsupplementary financing for the Regional Road Development Project to complete the road \ncorridor between Zamyn-Uud and Choyr is expected to begin in April 2010. \n \n23.  Lessons. Institutional weakness is a key constraint on timely and efficient execution of \nprojects and on long-term sustainability of the assets created. Local capacity constraints are \nexacerbated  by  a  highly  centralized  system  of  government  in  which  local  infrastructure \ninvestments remain largely at the discretion of the central government, and local officials lack \nthe budgetary and human resources to properly maintain infrastructure and effectively respond \nto constituents' needs. Incentives and resources for local governments to strengthen services \nare limited. The proposed project addresses the opportunity for greater local involvement in \nproject planning, design, and implementation, and the issue of capacity constraints and poor \nincentives  for  quality  service  provision  at  the  local  level.  In  adopting  a  design-and-build \nprocurement modality, the project eliminates problems experienced in prior ADB loans where \nthere is difficulty in assigning responsibility for deficiencies when infrastructure is turned over to \nlocal authorities.      \n \n24.  Projects  have  had  only  limited  and  variable  success  in  raising  tariffs,  resulting  in \nunderfunding of operation and maintenance. The support of ADB and other donors has focused \non rebuilding assets in a variety of urban subsectors, but has placed less emphasis on building \nthe institutions and systems required to ensure these assets are maintained and operated \nefficiently. Given the acute needs in urban areas in the 1990s, the emphasis on building and \nrehabilitating assets was justified. Today, it is clear that Mongolia lags behind other former \n                                                 \n6 World Bank, 2009, Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy Report, Washington DC \n ", "6   \nsocialist countries in institutional reform and strengthening, and risks wasting resources on \ninfrastructure that is not well maintained and managed. Appendix 2 provides more details on \nchallenges and opportunities in the urban sector.  \n \n25.  Link to government and ADB strategies. The project will be included in the Mongolia \ncountry partnership strategy and has been prepared based on (i) the National Development \nStrategy and ADB-supported urban sector road map; (ii) the World Bank-supported report on \nthe Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy (and particularly sections on housing and urban \ninfrastructure); (iii) the government\u2019s draft Infrastructure Development Plans for the Southern \nGobi prepared by the NDIC; 7 (iv) planned logistics infrastructure development at Zamyn-Uud \nand other border crossings; (v) the land management plan for the \u201cGalbyn Gobi\u201d micro-regional \ndevelopment concept prepared under the guidance of the MRTCUD; (vi) urban development \nmaster plans and investment plans prepared for aimag centers and key soum centers in the \nregion; and (vii) meetings and workshops with government officials, the private sector, and other \nstakeholders including town residents. \n \n26.  An urban development road map for the region has been prepared, which sets out the \ndevelopment goals and objectives for urban development for 2010 to 2015, and identifies \ninvestments to achieve these objectives. Based on the road map, an institutional reform and \ndevelopment framework has been developed which will support effective planning, financing, \nand operation of urban infrastructure and services. This sets out specific reforms, associated \ncapacity development, and a timetable for implementation. Emphasis is placed on improving \nlocal governance and urban planning and management capacity, improving the institutional and \ncontractual arrangements for service provision, enhancing national and local urban planning \nsystems  and  capacities,  and  minimizing  recurrent  expenditures  and  establishing  clear \naccountability for the performance of contractors and service providers. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The impact of the project will be enhanced economic development and livability in aimag \ncenters and mining and border towns in Southeast Gobi. The outcome of the project will be \nimproved urban governance8 and expanded access to sustainable infrastructure and services in \nurban places in Southeast Gobi. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n28.  To achieve these outcomes, the project will include two parts: institutional and capacity \ndevelopment, and priority infrastructure improvements. \n \n29.  Part  A  will finance consulting services  to  support  (i)  infrastructure services  reforms \nincluding performance-based contracts for urban services delivery, (ii) institutional development \nand capacity building to strengthen urban planning and policy making, (iii) strengthening of \nregional  cooperation  for  urban  development,  and  (iv)  project  management  and  project \nperformance monitoring.  \n \n                                                 \n7 National Development and Innovation Committee, Infrastructure Development Plans for the Southern Gobi, 2010 \ndraft \n8  \"Urban governance\" refers to local government land use planning and allocation to achieve effective spatial \ndevelopment, oversight of basic services provision, and accountability for discharging these functions. \n ", "  7\n30.  Support for infrastructure services reforms will comprise consulting services to assist \nwith drafting and tendering operating management contracts, capacity development for the \nregulator, and transaction advisory services. This will build on recent steps to lay a foundation \nfor private sector participation and greater accountability for performance, including the Law on \nConcessions, which was passed in February 2010 and sets out a legal basis for PPPs, steps to \nestablish  a  PPP  unit  to  support  transactions,  and  legislation  that  is  being  drafted  on  the \nprovision and regulation of municipal services.9 \n \n31.  Institutional development to strengthen urban planning and policy making will focus on \nthe MRTCUD and the two aimag centers, with the soum centers linking into the aimags for \nplanning  support.  Assistance  will  be  provided  in  developing  urban  master  plans  in  each \nparticipating town, which will take account of town-specific aspects including the development of \nan industrial park at Saynshand and a free economic zone at Zamyn-Uud. Support at the aimag \nlevel will help aimag and soum governments manage their urban development functions more \neffectively. More details on support for project management, organizational development and \ncapacity building are in Appendix 5. \n \n32.  Part A of the project will also support the creation of cross-border institutions with \nneighboring  districts  of  the  PRC  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  border  trade  and  exploit \nopportunities  for  shared  utilization  of  assets.10 A  joint  border  commission  will  be  created \ncomprising local government and business representatives from Mongolia and the PRC. The \ncommission will form separate working groups to resolve urban and border trade processing \nissues.  The  processing  working  group  will  address  processing  issues  leading  to  greater \nefficiency in cross-border transactions. An urban working group will review and resolve urban \ninfrastructure,  operational,  environmental,  and  institutional  issues,  thereby  contributing  to \nreduced disparity in the development of towns on the Mongolian and PRC sides of the border. \n \n33.  Project management and implementation support under part A will ensure that project \ninvestments are designed and constructed as planned and that resources are developed to \nprovide for sustainable management of the infrastructure so created. It will also support the \ndevelopment and implementation of a project benefit monitoring and evaluation system that will \nenable early identification of implementation problems and measurement of the project\u2019s impact.  \n \n34.  Part  B  will  finance  priority  infrastructure  improvements  providing  (i)  water  source \ndevelopment, transmission, storage, and distribution, allowing increased connections to piped \nwater supply and reducing system leakage; (ii) increased wastewater collection coverage and \nenhanced capacity for wastewater treatment and effluent reuse; (iii) improved efficiency and \ncoverage of district heating services; (iv) surfaced central road networks; (v) development of \ncontrolled solid-waste landfills and enhanced capacity for solid-waste collection; and (vi) in one \n                                                 \n9  The Law on Concessions was developed with assistance under ADB Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Support \nfor Public\u2013Private Partnerships (TA 7291-MON), and sets out a framework for the development of public\u2013private \npartnerships, including institutional responsibilities and a range of acceptable risk-sharing arrangements between \nthe public and private sectors. Proposed revisions to the Law on Utilization of Water Supply and Sewerage \nSystems, to be presented to Parliament in 2010, describe a mechanism to set minimum tariffs and quality \nstandards. It is expected that tariffs and service quality described in Operating Management Contract (OMC) will \nhave to meet these minimums.  \n10  Establishment  of  a  Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erlian  joint  border  commission  was  recommended  under  ADB  Technical \nAssistance for Development of Regional Cooperation Programs for Mongolia and the PRC. The project will support \nthe establishment and operation of subcommittees charged with urban development and cross-border trade. ADB. \n2006.

In the water supply sector the project will support high-priority infrastructure investments \nto  upgrade  existing  bore  wells  and  provide  trunk  transmission,  distribution,  and  water \ndistribution  points  (water  kiosks)  for  ger  areas.  In  the  three  larger  towns,  the  project  will \naugment the existing water supply systems. In the three small towns, wholly new piped water \nsupply systems will be constructed. Offsite provision in all three small soums will be supplied \nfrom the adjacent mining companies which plan to deliver water to reservoir tanks outside the \ntowns.  Service  levels  will  include  in-house  connections  where  possible.  Apartment  blocks, \nhouses, and all nonresidential buildings will have multifaucet piped water supplies. Where this is \nnot possible or affordable, such as in the ger areas,11 the aim is to have water kiosks within 300 \nmeters of any town dweller. In the case of rehabilitated and new production, the project will \nensure  effective  coordination  and  consultation  with  the  National  Water  Authority,  which \noversees water resource management issues, and with any future groundwater monitoring \nagencies.  \n \n36.  In the wastewater sector, the project will rehabilitate and expand the existing sewerage \nsystems in the three larger towns and provide new sewerage systems in the small towns. These \nsewerage systems will link unsewered permanent housing areas to the sewerage system. \nWastewater  treatment  in  all  cases  will  use  waste  stabilization  ponds  which  are  simple  to \nconstruct and manage and have only modest power requirements. In Gurvantes there is a \nproblem with run-off from the hills and an interceptor drain is included under part B to protect the \ntown from storm flash flooding. In district heating, the project will adopt a similar approach with \naugmentation and some rehabilitation of existing systems in the larger towns and new systems \nin most of the smaller soum centers. The project will provide new boilers, pumps, and boiler \n                                                 \n11  Due to the extremely low winter temperatures in Mongolia, it is not possible to provide individual yard taps. Pipes \nmust be buried at least 2.8 meters underground and faucets must be in heated buildings to avoid freezing. \n \n ", "  9\nhouses in some cases, combined with the replacement of inefficient pipes and exchangers to \nproduce more efficient heating systems.   \n \n37.  Road  improvements  are  proposed  for  the  two  aimag  centers  and  in  Gurvantes, \nHanbogd, and Tsogttsetsii soums to provide better form and structure to the towns. This will \nassist in guiding growth, and reduce dust from driving on existing dirt roads. By defining driving \nspace, roads accidents will also be reduced. Since the cost of asphalt roads in this area would \nbe similar to the cost of concrete roads, and as concrete roads last longer and require less \nmaintenance, it is proposed to use concrete for all roads.   \n \n38.  The approach to solid-waste management will support the ongoing initiatives recently \ncommenced by most local governments. The project aims to ensure that all waste is collected \nand transported to sites where it can be recycled or disposed of to sanitary landfill sites. This will \nentail capping existing dumpsites, developing new landfill sites, and providing collection and \nlandfill equipment. \n \nC.  Special Features \n39.  Implementation  arrangements  for  the  project  provide  aimag  governments  with  a \nsubstantive  role  in  implementation.  Lessons  from  three  ADB-financed  urban  infrastructure \nprojects in Mongolia indicate that deficiencies in design quality and delays in implementation \ncould be avoided if local governments were involved in design and supervision of infrastructure \ninvestments.  This  is  also  supported  by  international  experience,  which  suggests  that  the \nresponsibilities of local government should be aligned with its accountability for the quality of \nservice provision. For this reason, aimag governments will be the contracting authority for \ndesign-and-build contracts under part B, and will benefit from technical assistance under part A. \n  \n40.  Another special feature of the project will be opportunities for private sector participation \nin providing and managing urban services. During project implementation, a service provider will \nbe  engaged  in  each  of  the  two  project  aimags  under  a  lease  arrangement  (operating \nmanagement contract [OMC]) to operate, maintain, expand, and improve urban services in \nproject aimag and soum centers for 10\u201315 years.  \n \n41.  Two  parallel  sets  of  project  activities  will  contribute  to  this  objective.  First,  aimag \ngovernments will tender the package of priority infrastructure improvements under a design-\nand-build modality. Under advance action, consultants will be recruited to prepare reference \ndesigns and contract documents for three contracts (two in Omnogovi and one in Dornogovi) for \nthe design and construction of the priority infrastructure improvements in aimag and soum \ncenters.  The  aimag  governments  will  be  supported  by  project  implementation  unit  (PIU) \nconsultants  and  PUSO  staff  who  will  be  seconded  part-time  to  the  project  to  assist  in \nsupervision.  \n \n42.  Second, under part A and in parallel with preparing and tendering each design-and-build \ncontract, consultants will advise government on structuring long-term OMCs between each \naimag government and a private sector urban services company (USC) for operation of existing \nand new assets. The OMC would cover the aimag centers and soum centers for each aimag, \nand be regulated through the terms of the contract. A central independent regulatory body, to be \nestablished with assistance under the project, will set service quality standards and minimum \ntariffs. The USC, upon being awarded the OMC, will gain an equity stake in the PUSO and its \noperating assets; the balance of the PUSO\u2019s shares will be owned by the aimag government \n ", "10  \nand PUSO managers and staff. The OMC will be awarded for a minimum of 10 years. Details of \nthe contracts will be determined on the basis of transaction advice to be provided under part A. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n43.  The project is estimated to cost $21.90 million equivalent, including duties and taxes of \nabout $1.99 million.12 Table 2 summarizes the estimated cost.

Financing Plan \n44.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $15 million from ADB's Special \nFunds resources to cover 68.6% of the total project cost. The grant will cover, on a \"gross of \ntaxes\" basis, 90% of the cost of consulting services, including project management costs, 61% \nof the cost of civil works, and 90.9% of the cost of equipment. Taxes and duties estimated at \n$1.988 million will be financed by the Government of Mongolia. A further domestic contribution \nof $4.9 million equivalent is required, which will comprise $4.8 million equivalent from the \ngovernment and $0.1 million equivalent in kind from the beneficiary aimag governments to cover \nland acquisition and office facilities. The grant recipient will be Mongolia through the MOF. The \nproposed financing plan for the project is shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n \nTotal Cost  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank   15.0  68.6 \nGovernment of Mongolia  6.8  30.9 \nAimag governments  0.1  0.5 \nTotal  21.9  100.0 \nSource(s): ADB staff estimates \n                                                 \n12  Sector investment needs for the project towns in Southeast Gobi to serve the projected 2040 population are \nestimated at a base cost of $250 million. The medium-term investment plan to provide trunk services and tertiary \ninfrastructure to serve the projected 2025 population is estimated at a base cost of about $50 million. The medium-\nterm investment plan is used as the basis for the priority infrastructure investments that are supported by the grant. \n ", " 11\n \n45.  In  accordance  with  the  prevailing  practice  for  externally  financed  projects,  the \ngovernment, through the MOF, will extend a portion ($12.2 million) of the proceeds of the grant \nto participating aimag governments through grant agreements. This approach is justified given \nthe demonstration value associated with introducing substantial reforms in municipal services \ndelivery, and the economy-wide benefits of supporting sustainable growth of livable towns that \ncan support mining and trade development. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n46.  The MRTCUD will be the executing agency, supported by a project management unit \n(PMU) headed by a project director. The MRTCUD will be responsible for overall strategic \nguidance, technical supervision, and execution of the project, ensuring compliance with grant \ncovenants. Implementation of the priority infrastructure investments component (part B) will be \ncarried out by the aimag governments. PIUs will be established in each aimag and will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of physical works. The MRTCUD will coordinate the \nactivities of the two PIUs at the aimag level through consultants and PMU staff, and will facilitate \nprocessing  and  approvals  of  designs,  contracts,  and  other  documents  as  required  at  the \nministry level. The project director, supported by the PMU and consultants, will (i) coordinate all \nactivities under the project; (ii) be responsible for overall project execution, monitoring, and \nsupervision; and (iii) will directly report to the chair of the project steering committee (PSC).  \n \n47.  A state-level PSC will be set up with full powers to take decisions on matters relating to \nproject execution. The project director will be the member secretary and the committee will be \nchaired by the state secretary of the MRTCUD. Members of the committee will include the chair \nof the NDIC, director of the Budget Policy Department of the MOF, and representatives of the \nMinistry  of  Nature,  Environment  and  Tourism,  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy, \nMRTCUD, and the aimag governments of Dornogovi and Omnogovi. Once the project is made \neffective,  the  PSC  will  meet  at  quarterly  intervals  to  review  project  performance  and  take \ndecisions  on  major  issues  such  as  counterpart  funding,  implementation  bottlenecks,  land \ndisputes,  special  procurement,  and  policy  reforms.  More  details  on  project  execution  and \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n48.  The PMU will be responsible for (i) appointing project management, detailed design, and \nconstruction supervision consultants; (ii) approving the design of the investment components in \nconsultation with the aimag governments and project towns; (iii) assisting the PIUs to prepare \nstandard bid documents, monitoring the tendering process, and guiding the project towns in \nevaluating bids and preparing bid evaluation reports for approval by ADB; (iv) coordinating with \nADB on matters related to disbursement; (v) monitoring compliance with grant covenants; and \n(vi) maintaining project documents and submitting timely reports to ADB. \n \n49.  The MRTCUD will be the implementing agency for part A. The participating aimag \ngovernments  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  part  B.  In  each  aimag,  a  PIU  will  be \nestablished and headed by a senior technical staff member experienced in water supply, public \nhealth,  and  environmental  engineering.  The  PIUs  will  comprise  three  sections:  (i)  urban \ninfrastructure and services, (ii) community awareness and participation, and (iii) finance and \nadministration. The responsibilities of the PIUs shall include (i) carrying out detailed surveys, \ninvestigations,  and  engineering  designs  of  the  subprojects;  (ii)  with  the  assistance  of \nconsultants, preparing bid documents, tendering, evaluating bids, and awarding works; (iii) \n ", "12  \ncontract  administration,  supervision  and  quality  control,  measuring  works  carried  out  by \ncontractors,  and  certifying  payments;  (iv)  conducting  public  awareness  campaigns  and \nparticipation  programs;  (v)  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  studies  and  environmental \nassessment; (vi) implementing resettlement plans; and (vii) preparing monthly reports. Aimag \ngovernments will implement the subprojects with technical assistance from the PIUs.  \n \n50.  The performance of each PIU will be monitored and guided by aimag working groups \nchaired by the aimag governors. The working groups will comprise representatives from the \naimag government, soum governors, PIU, PUSO, participating community-based organizations, \nand civil society representatives to include prominent citizens. The aimag working group will \nmeet at least once every 6 months to review the progress and resolve local issues and policy \nmatters. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n51.  The project will be implemented over 4.5 years beginning in June 2010 and ending in \nNovember 2014. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n52.  Procurement financed from the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive \nbidding (ICB) will be applied to supply contracts estimated to cost $500,000 or more. Supply \ncontracts with a value less than $500,000 will follow national competitive bidding (NCB), and \nthose  less  than  $100,000  will  follow  shopping  procedures  as  reflected  by  particular \ncircumstances of the contract packages. ICB will be used for civil works contracts valued at \n$1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued at less than $1 million but more than $100,000 \nwill be procured using NCB procedures. The selection and engagement of contractors will be \nsubject  to  ADB  approval.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  recipient\u2019s \nprocedures will be documented in the procurement plan. Any internationally tendered equipment \npackages will include the necessary technical support to ensure proper installation, testing, \ncommissioning,  and  training  of  operational  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n53.  Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures, consultant qualification selection, and/or individual consultant selection procedures \nThe project will require a total of about 80 person-months of international and 350 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  to  support  (i)  the  PMU  and  PIUs  in  project \nimplementation and management; (ii) development of structure plans for all project towns; \n(iii) an improved institutional and incentive framework for urban service delivery; (iv) improved \nlocal government capacity for urban planning, land management system planning, operations, \nand maintenance; (v) enhanced cost recovery from services through metering and tariff reform; \nand  (vi)  improved  local  government  revenues  and  financial  management  through  the \nestablishment of predictable recurrent financing and performance-based contracting and private \nsector participation.  \n  \n54.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project  management  and \nprocurement,  urban  and  regional  planning,  financial  management,  institutional  and \norganizational development, capacity building, and training. The national consultants will have \n ", " 13\nexpertise in water and wastewater engineering, resettlement, environmental management, legal \naspects,  database  development,  financial  management,  construction  supervision,  and \nengineering design. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All international \nconsultants  and  the  national  consultants  for  project  management  will  be  selected  and \ncontracted individually. International and national consultants for development of service lease \nagreements  and  contract  preparation,  urban  planning  reform,  and  reference  design  and \npreparation of tender documents for design-and-build contracts will be selected and contracted \nas  firms  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  among  short-listed \ninternational and national consulting firms.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n55.  To  facilitate  timely  implementation,  the  government  has  requested  consideration  of \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  up  to  20%  of  the \nproposed grant, incurred prior to effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of \nsigning of the grant agreement. The issuance of invitations to bid or prequalify under advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing would be subject to ADB approval. All advance contracting \nand retroactive financing would be undertaken according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The government acknowledges that any approval of \nadvance contracting and/or retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by ADB to \nfinance the related project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy and Government Measures  \n56.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MRTCUD  and  aimag  governments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the project will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the MRTCUD, the aimag governments, \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nproject. The MRTCUD and the aimag governments will undertake the following actions as \nspecified in the anticorruption strategy (Supplementary Appendix Z): (i) introduce a dual-signing \nsystem in which the civil works contractor agrees to an anticorruption clause in the contract with \nthe employer; (ii) adopt third-party oversight (under the PMU) involving periodic inspection of \ncontractors' activities related to construction, fund withdrawals, and settlements; (iii) community \noversight over the works, implemented in partnership with local nongovernment organizations; \nand (iv) extensive public disclosure of key contract documents. Tender, construction, financial, \nand summary technical information will be disclosed on the project website, in local government \noffices,  and  on  notice  boards  at  the  project  site.  At  any  time  during  implementation  and \nafterwards,  project  management  or  community  members  who  suspect  corruption  or  have \ngrievances will be able to contact the PMU through the PIU or aimag government, who are \nobligated  to  convey  such  information  unchanged  and  without  delay  to  the  PMU  and  the \nexecuting agency. All complaints will be assessed, instances of suspected corruption will be \ninvestigated,  and  sanctions  will  be  imposed  on  those  against  whom  corrupt  practices  are \nproved. \n \n ", "14  \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n57.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through timely \nrelease of grant proceeds, the PMU will establish and administer two imprest accounts\u2014one for \ncomponent A, and one for component B\u2014promptly after grant effectiveness at a commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB.13 A sub-account will be established and administered by each of the \ntwo  PIUs. 14  Replenishment  of  the  sub-accounts  will  be  based  on  quarterly  plans  for \nmanagement and operations expenses and submission of full supporting documentation to the \nPMU. Disbursements from the imprest accounts will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal \napplication and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other \nthings, that the goods and/or services are procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, and are \neligible for ADB financing. The maximum amount to be deposited into each imprest account will \nnot exceed the estimated expenditures to be financed from the respective imprest account for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% (in aggregate) of the grant amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s \nstatement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible \nexpenditures up to a ceiling of $100,000 per payment. Flow of funds under the grant is further \ndescribed in Appendix 11. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n58.  The government, through the PMU and PIUs, will maintain separate financial accounts \nfor the project, and have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  grant \nagreement and as specified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by \nthe  Bank.15 The  auditors  should  have  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference \nacceptable to ADB. The use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be \npart of the annual audit and a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The government will \nsubmit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, \nand the related reports and auditors, within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n \n59.  For the purpose of complying with the requirements for the annual audited financial \nstatements, the proceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for private financial \nstatements, sector auditors, and translations of auditor\u2019s reports into English. The PMU will \nsubmit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the government on all \naspects of project implementation. The reports will include details on overall implementation \nprogress, problems encountered during the reporting period, measures taken or proposed to be \ntaken to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of activities for the following \nquarter. Within 6 months of project completion, the PMU will prepare and submit to ADB, in a \nformat acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on the utilization and impact of the grant; \nperformance  of  the  project;  economic  and  social  benefits  generated;  and  details  about \nimplementation, costs, resettlement, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n60.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will focus on targets and indicators \nidentified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  including  (i)  public  satisfaction  with  the \n                                                 \n13 Bank charges will be financed from the grant resources. \n14 Dornogovi and Omnogovi aimags have an experience of using sub-accounts under ADB project L1907-MON: \nIntegrated Development of Basic Urban Services in Provincial Towns.  \n15 ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n ", " 15\nneighborhood environment; (ii) economic and health data; (iii) the number of households served \nby the improved water supply; (iv) the number of public institutions served by the improved \nwater  supply  and  sewerage;  (v)  improvements  in  solid-waste  collection  and  landfill  site \nmanagement; (vi) improvement in PUSO (and future USC) performance; (vii) land acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  environmental  compliance;  and  (viii)  monitoring,  reporting,  and  National \nInspection Agency reporting.  \n \n61.  At the beginning of the project, the PMU and PIUs, with assistance from the consultants, \nwill develop PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the \nproject, as well as the agreed socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be used \nto measure project impacts; and obtain ADB\u2019s approval within the first 3 months after grant \neffectiveness. The PMU will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets, determine \nmonitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 \nmonths after grant effectiveness. \n \n62.  The PPMS\u2014including establishing benchmarks, collecting baseline and progress data, \nmonitoring  benefits,  and  evaluating  social  impact\u2014will  be  implemented  by  the  PIUs  in \ncollaboration with the aimag governments and PUSOs (or USCs). Data will be presented in \nsimple formats that allow local inputs and respond to reporting formats. The PMU will be \nresponsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  resulting  data  through  its  management \ninformation system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial \naction regarding project design, schedules, and activities. The PMU will report to ADB quarterly \non both the physical implementation and financial aspects of the project to ensure that impacts \nare monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n10.  Project Review \n63.  The government and ADB will jointly review implementation progress at least once a \nyear. In addition, the government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review after \n2 years of project implementation. The midterm review will include a detailed assessment of \nscope, implementation arrangements, achievement of scheduled targets, progress made in \npolicy and tariff reform, and capacity building measures. A detailed assessment of parts A and B \nwill be undertaken. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.   Benefits and Impacts \n \n64.  Economic and financial benefits. The project will directly benefit about 100,000 people \nin six towns in Omnogovi and Dornogovi aimags, of whom approximately 30.7% live below the \npoverty  line.  The  project  components  have  strong  economic  rationale  since  they  provide \nminimum  acceptable  standards  for  basic  living  conditions  and  assist  in  removing  existing \nconstraints  on  social  development  and  economic  growth.  Similarly,  priority  infrastructure \nimprovements were designed in accordance with sound principles of priority need, consultation \nand  targeting,  and  demand  management.  The  project  supports  rehabilitation  before  new \ninvestment, and subprojects represent technically feasible options at least cost. The project will \ndevelop several direct and indirect benefits. Better access to potable water with improved water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services  (in  formal  areas)  will  provide  several  long-  and  short-term \nbenefits. There will be qualitative improvement in the lives of the communities, in particular \nthose people living in the ger areas. Living conditions will improve at individual and communal \nlevels, including benefits from reduced water collection times and improved health. \n ", "16  \n \n65.  The water supply and wastewater economic analysis shows that economic internal rates \nof return are all well above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12% in Mongolia, except \nin the case of Zamyn-Uud where it is marginally lower at 11.6% (Supplementary Appendix S). \nThe wide range (52.1% in Dalanzadgad to 11.6% in Zamyn-Uud) mainly reflects variations in \nper capita costs arising out of the base population and the characteristics of the area. The \neconomic internal rates of return when subjected to sensitivity tests under key variables are \nmost sensitive to decrease in benefits associated with improved infrastructure, and remain \nabove the opportunity cost of capital in all towns except Zamyn-Uud. \n \n66.  Financial  analysis  was  undertaken  for  revenue-generating  components,  including  a \ncombined analysis of water supply and wastewater, heating, and solid-waste management. \nBasic assumptions in computing the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were as follows: \n(i) all revenues and costs are expressed in constant prices on an incremental basis; (ii) capital \nexpenditures  include  all  costs,  less  taxes  and  duties  and  price  contingencies;  (iii)  capital \nexpenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred, while interest and finance charges are \nexcluded;  and  (iv)  incremental  operating  costs  are  calculated  by  subtracting  the  existing \nsystem\u2019s operating costs from the projected operating costs for the whole system at project \ncompletion. The value of benefits arising from water sales was calculated by multiplying the \nvolume of water sold each year by the proposed tariffs used for each year in constant prices, \nwith an annual increase of 6% to fall in line with inflation. For sewerage, the estimated cash \nflows were based on the wastewater surcharge on water bills. Benefits and costs were kept \nconstant after financial year 2021 when all facilities would be operating at near full capacity and \npresent design demands would be fully satisfied. \n \n67.  Financial  analysis  assumes  that  (i)  the  mini-PUSOs  at  the  soum  centers  will  be \nabsorbed into the new USCs or fully established under the State and Local Property Law by the \ncompletion of the project by 2014 to take responsibility for owning (or leasing) and operating \nexisting and proposed services under the project; and (ii) the services which are currently \nprovided by the railways in Saynshand and Zamyn-Uud will be transferred to the existing \nPUSOs (or subsequent USC) in Saynshand and the fully fledged PUSO in Zamyn-Uud, or the \nnew Omnogovi USC when established.  \n \n68.  The combined FIRRs for all project components vary between 23.7% in Dalanzadgad \nand 7.4% in Zamyn-Uud. Combined FIRRs for water supply and wastewater vary between \n25.2%  in  Dalanzadgad  and  4.7%  in  Saynshand  (Supplementary  Appendix  T).  The  wide \nvariation is mainly due to the nature of the scheme, distance from source, service coverage, and \noperation and maintenance costs. Piped water supply and wastewater in the smaller towns of \nTsogttsetsii, Hanbogd, and Gurvantes, and also in Zamyn-Uud, are new and therefore cost-\nintensive with full benefits to be derived over the longer term. The FIRRs for heating services \nvary between 24.9% in Hanbogd and 18.9% in Gurvantes, and for solid-waste management \nbetween 25.6% in Zamyn-Uud and 6.4% Gurvantes. Sensitivity tests indicate that FIRRs are \nsensitive to decreased revenues and delays in project benefits by 1 year.  \n \n69.  Financial sustainability of the project investments will be achieved by applying minimum \ntariffs as set out in the financial improvement action plans for each aimag (Supplementary \nAppendix W). The proposed OMCs are also expected to bring about cost-recovery tariffs. \nEarlier Mongolian studies on affordability for water supplies have generally found willingness to \npay  to  be  at  levels  exceeding  prevailing  prices,  particularly  in  ger  areas.  No  affordability \nproblems are seen for upper- and middle-income domestic consumers who will pay according to \nactual consumption billed at the two-tier level including a lifeline consumption charged at a lower \n ", " 17\nrate. The adoption of individual apartment metering will result in controlled consumption and \nreduced pressure on affordability. The average expenditure combined for water and wastewater \nat average household consumption is estimated to be below the affordability level of 6% of \nincome. Informal area residents, using only retail water supply, pay less than 2% of income. \n \n70.  Social  and  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  project  is  designed  to  have \nmultidimensional  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  by  improving  infrastructure  and  services, \ncreating  direct  employment  for  construction  and  indirect  long-term  income-generating \nopportunities, and empowering poor residents in decision-making processes through improved \nurban governance. The project will have positive health benefits. Residents are expected to \nexperience a reduction in the incidence of water- and vector-borne diseases and medical costs \nand lost earning opportunities incurred as a result of these diseases.  \n \n71.  It is anticipated that the sector reforms will result in tariff increases for water supply, \nwastewater management, and district heating to enable service providers to recover sufficient \ncosts to cover operational expenditures. The potential negative impact on the poor is mitigated \nby (i) financial analysis showing that increased tariffs would still remain within affordability and \nwillingness-to-pay levels; and (ii) the poor live predominantly in ger areas that do not benefit \nfrom  sewerage  or  district  heating,  and  where  potable  water  is  carried  from  water  kiosks, \nresulting in low levels of consumption. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 12. \n \n72.  Gender  equality  impacts.  The  project  is  designed  to  produce  benefits  that  are \ndisproportionately directed toward women, who bear most of the burden associated with poor \nservice  delivery.  Women  and  their  children  spend  most  of  their  time  at  home  and  in  the \nneighborhood. The proposed project will provide opportunities to (i) relieve time and labor \nburdens  on  women  created  by  the  lack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services; \n(ii) improve women\u2019s living conditions, health, and hygiene; (iii) create employment and income-\ngenerating opportunities for women; and (iv) empower women as decision makers through \nactive involvement of women in the development process. Activities, targets, and indicators are \nset out in a gender action plan in Appendix 9. \n \n73.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  It  is  anticipated  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement will not be significant and can be avoided for most activities. Some houses, gers, \nand fences will need to be relocated to nearby plots only in the proposed roads improvement \npriority  infrastructure  investment  in  Hanbogd.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,16 a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared. To provide a \nframework for unanticipated land acquisition and resettlement as a result of changes in project \nsites prior to implementation, a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) has also \nbeen prepared. The LARF sets out (i) the resettlement policy and Mongolian legal framework for \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  (ii) compensation  standards  and  entitlements,  (iii) \nimplementation arrangements, (iv) consultation and participation, (v) eligibility provision, (vi) a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  (vii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (viii)  provision  of  the \nresettlement budget. The PIUs will be responsible for overall resettlement management and \ncoordination,  internal  monitoring,  and  quarterly  reporting  to  ADB.  The  PIUs  will  also  take \nprimary responsibility for resettlement consultation, notices, implementation, and timely delivery \nof  entitlements.  Because  of  limited  experience  with  involuntary  resettlement,  training  and \ncapacity building will be conducted under part A. The PMU will review the remaining activities \nunder part B before the award of the civil works contracts to ensure there are no involuntary \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila.  \n ", "18  \nresettlement  effects  that  would  require  compensation  and  other  assistance.  If  impacts  are \nidentified  and  cannot  be  avoided  in  other  project  activities,  a  LARP  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the provisions of the LARF and submitted to ADB. A summary of the LARPs \nand LARF are in Appendix 10. No indigenous peoples are living in the project area. \n \n74.  Environmental  impacts  and  benefits.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental \ncategory B. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were carried out for all of the part B \nactivities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. In accordance with ADB's \ninformation and disclosure and consultation requirements, these subprojects and the potential \nenvironmental impacts were presented and discussed at stakeholder meetings and focus group \ndiscussions. Key environmental impacts during construction are largely temporary in nature, \nand  include  dust,  gaseous  emissions,  noise,  and  some  public  inconvenience.  Operational \nimpacts might include gaseous emissions, contamination of water supply, improper treatment \nand disposal of sludge, or escape of leachate. The extent of these impacts will be mitigated with \nmeasures  identified  in  the  IEEs  including  careful  project  management  and  contractor \ncompliance during construction with an environmental management plan integral to the contract \ndocuments. Key mitigation measures during operation are securing an adequate operational \nbudget, implementing reforms to service institutions under the project, and developing (under \nthe project) operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals for (i) water supply and wastewater \nmanagement;  (ii)  solid  waste  management;  and  (iii)  district  heating  that  incorporate  the \nconditions stipulated in the environmental permit, if necessary, and the proposed mitigation \nmeasures specified in the environmental management plan (EMP).  \n \n75.  The recipient's institutional capacity to manage environmental risks is limited, with a \nsingle trained full-time environmental staff member working at the aimag level and a single \nuntrained environmental inspector covering all environmental matters in each soum. Aimag and \nsoum environmental management and monitoring capacity will be strengthened with capacity \ndevelopment and training under part A, and the PIUs will be staffed and assisted with technical \nspecialists  and  qualified  consultants  including  environmental  management  specialists.  The \nproject  will  greatly  improve  community  health  and  living  conditions,  reduce  environmental \npollution, and decrease per capita demand for energy resources by improving the efficiency of \nurban  services.  Priority  infrastructure  investments  in  solid-waste  management  will  reduce \ngroundwater pollution, and improved urban roads will reduce dust and noise. EMPs, including \nthe Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM), will be refined during the detailed design stage \nusing a consultation process with affected persons and closely consulting project stakeholders. \nAn  environmental  safeguard  specialist  will  ensure  revised  IEEs  and  EMPs  during  detailed \nengineering design. \n \n76.  Institutional  benefits. There is a need for reform, organizational development, and \ninstitutional strengthening at the national and local government levels. Reform will focus on (i) \nservice delivery with the development of enhanced contractual arrangements, service quality \nand tariff regulation, and partial divestiture of utility companies; and (ii) urban and regional \nplanning. At the local government level, institutional development and capacity building will \nfocus  on  planning  and  financial  management,  operation  and  maintenance  of  basic  urban \ninfrastructure and facilities, maintenance planning for urban services, community participatory \nstructures and process, environmental monitoring, and handling of resettlement issues.  \n \nB.  Risks \n \n77.  The 2008 joint country portfolio performance review and a 2008 risk assessment for the \neducation and urban infrastructure sectors noted key sector risks as poor capital investment and \n ", " 19\nbudget  planning,  underdeveloped  institutional  frameworks  and  poor  capacity,  a  lack  of \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  poor  procurement  integrity,  and  weak  national  contractors.  The \nproject addresses these risks by including capacity building at national and local government \nlevels in investment planning, building the capacity of local service institutions with increased \nprivate sector participation, focusing institutional change on measuring and improving service \ndelivery  performance,  adopting  a  design-and-build  modality  for  procurement  of  priority \ninfrastructure improvements to attract better-qualified contractors, and combining individual civil \nworks  activities  into  larger  contract  packages  to  generate  economies  of  scale  and  create \npackages which are eligible for ICB. The project will also introduce a dual-signing system and \nperiodic inspections of contractors' activities as described in para. 59.  \n \n78.  It is assumed that anticipated demand for urban infrastructure services in the project \ntowns will materialize. The influx projections underlying the selection of priority infrastructure \nimprovements under part B assume that mining developments continue and that the major \nmining  companies  remain  committed  to  forms  of  mine  development  that  support  urban \ndevelopment in neighboring towns, and complete power supply and water source development \nprojects as planned. There is also an assumption that government policy continues to allow free \nmovement of people to the project areas. \n \n79.  Government policies on PPP for the provision of municipal services are central to project \noutcomes. There is an assumption that the arrangements for the proposed reform to service \ndelivery institutions in aimag and soum centers is supported, in particular that contracts for \noperation of municipal services proceed and are supported by a viable independent regulatory \nmechanism. Concrete steps have been taken in this direction and are backed by progress on \nkey legislation including the Law on Concessions. There is an assumption that the domestic \nprivate sector is interested in partnering with the public sector to form USCs. Based on a market \nsounding exercise completed in 2009, there are strong indications of interest from domestic \nfirms. \n \n80.  The  project  does  not  have  any  particular  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for water supply, wastewater \nmanagement,  solid-waste  management,  and  roads.  The  proposed  design-and-build \nprocurement  modality  and  packaging  of  priority  infrastructure  improvements  will  provide \ncontracts  that  qualify  for  ICB  and  attract  better-qualified  contractors.  ICB  equipment \nprocurement  will  include  technical  support  for  installing,  testing,  and  commissioning  as \nrecommended by the manufacturer. During project implementation, the PMU will support the \nPIUs to ensure that equipment and civil works comply with design requirements and quality \nstandards, and establish sustainable groundwater supply yields and groundwater monitoring. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n81.  The  government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n82.  Within  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  government  will  revise  the  Law  on \nUtilization of Water Supply and Sewerage Systems by Parliament, which includes, among other \nthings, (i) establishment of an independent central regulator that will issue licenses and regulate \ntariffs and service quality levels; and (ii) a mechanism by which contracted private operators \nmay participate in operation of water and sewerage systems by contracting with central or local \n ", "20  \nauthority, as the case may be, and which allows such contractors to set tariff or service fee, \nprovided either the contract is consistent with the regulatory rules or the regulator approves the \ncontract. \n \n83.  Within  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  each  participating  aimag  government  will \nexecute an operating management contract with a USC, specifying: minimum tariffs, and how \nthese change over time; minimum service quality targets; the USC's purchase of a portion of \nPUSO shares; the transfer of a portion of the PUSO's shares to PUSO management and staff; \nand the USC's investment in certain operating assets. In particular, each OMC will (i) allow that \ntariffs will be set at levels that recover at least O&M costs (including depreciation or renewals), \nand (ii) set service quality requirements so as to comply with relevant Mongolian law (including \nthe water quality guidelines in the Water Law, 2004 and Law on Utilization of Water and \nSewerage Services, 2002). Such tariffs and service quality requirements may differ by aimag \nand soum and between planned and ger areas.  \n \n84.  Prior to the period that OMCs will be operational, each aimag government will (i) ensure \nthat  its  PUSO  will  operate  and  maintain  project  facilities  for  which  it  is  responsible;  and \n(ii) allocate and make available sufficient funds from its budget in a timely manner for each fiscal \nyear for O&M of the project facilities. \n \n85.  The government, with assistance from the consultants, will develop PPMS procedures to \ngenerate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the project, as well as the agreed \nsocioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be used to measure project impacts; \nand obtain ADB\u2019s approval within the first 3 months after grant effectiveness. The PMU will \n(i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) determine monitoring and \nrecording arrangements, (iv) establish systems and procedures, and (v) complete baseline \nsurveys no later than 6 months after grant effectiveness. \n \n86.

PIUs will issue bid \ndocuments only after approval from the Ministry of Nature and Environment and ADB's review \nand clearance of the updated IEEs have been obtained. PIUs will submit monitoring reports on \nthe implementation of the respective EMPs to PMU which will prepare and submit periodic \nmonitoring reports at least annually to ADB during Project construction and until the Closing \nDate. The  bid documents for civil works contracts and contract documents will include (i) the \nupdated IEEs and EMPs as attachments; (ii) provision requiring them to operationalize EMP \nbefore implementation by developing detailed management plans or site-specific management \nplans,  as  necessary;  (iii)  appropriate  clauses  to  ensure  EMPs  are  implemented  during \nconstruction; (iv) environmental conditions to be met for preliminary or final acceptance, during \nwhich the contractor's responsibility is partially/fully released, such measures that contractors \nwill properly dispose the surplus construction materials and solid wastes and conduct general \nsite clean up including of construction camps, rehabilitate borrow pits and quarry sites, as \napplicable in the EMPs; (v) penalties to be incurred by contractors for major default in the \nimplementation of EMP; (vi) information on their track records; and (vii) appropriate provisions \nthat their environmental performance will be evaluated. \n \n87.  The government will ensure that: (i) all land and rights-of-way required by the Project are \nmade available in a timely manner; (ii) to the extent possible, the Project will minimize land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement; (iii) a LARP for the Hanbogd subproject dated January \n2010 is implemented efficiently in accordance with its terms, all applicable government's laws \n ", " 21\nand  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement    (2009);  (iv)  all  physically  or \neconomically displaced persons are given adequate opportunity to participate in resettlement \nplanning and implementation; (v) during implementation, any significant material changes in \nsubproject scope or other causes are advised to ADB, reflected in an updated LARP, and \nsubmitted to ADB for its approval, and such updated LARP is disclosed to affected persons by \nthe relevant implementing agencies prior to ADB approval; (vi) counterpart funds are provided \non a timely basis for land acquisition and resettlement activities, and any obligations in excess \nof resettlement plan budget estimates are met; (vii) compensation and resettlement assistance \nis given to affected persons prior to dispossession and displacement to ensure that the affected \npersons will be at least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the project; (viii) \ncompensation and resettlement assistance is given to affected persons prior to dispossession \nand displacement to ensure that the affected persons will be at least as well off as they would \nhave been in the absence of the project; (ix) adequate staff and resources are committed to \nresettlement monitoring and supervision; (x) PMU reports resettlement implementation to ADB \nas specified in the LARP; and (xi) civil works contractors are supervised to ensure compliance \nwith requirements of the LARP, applicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). \n \n88.  If land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement are required for any other subprojects, \nthe government will prepare or will cause to be prepared, a LARP for such subproject in \naccordance with: (i) the government's applicable laws and regulations, (ii) ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), and (iii) the LARF. Such LARPs will be based on the final detailed \ndesign for the relevant subprojects, and disclosed to the affected people, and will be submitted \nto ADB for approval prior to any land acquisition being initiated. \n \n89.  The government will ensure that civil works contracts have clauses that the contractors \nwill: (i) provide transparent recruitment procedures, especially for local residents; (ii) provide \nvocational  training  where  appropriate;  (iii)  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  risks  of \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for those \nemployed during construction and operation of the mines and project; and (iv) follow and \nimplement legally mandated provisions on labor including equal pay for equal work, health, \nsafety, sanitation, and working conditions. \n \n90.  The government will ensure that the agreed community consultation and participation \nframework will be implemented to enhance the participation of the community, including women, \nin project planning and implementation.  Contacts and dialogue with the beneficiaries built up \nduring the public consultation phase will be used as a basis to form infrastructure project \nimplementation committees one per soum center.  Such committees will include equal numbers \nof working-age women and men and will include representative from low-income households. \n91.  MRTCUD and the aimag governments will undertake the following actions as specified \nin the Project's anticorruption strategy: (i) having anti-corruption provisions in the civil works \ncontract; (ii) adoption of third party oversight (under PMU) involving periodic inspection of \ncontractors' activities related to construction, fund withdrawals and settlements; (iii) community \noversight over the works, implemented (in partnership with local NGOs); and (iv) extensive \npublic  disclosure  of  key  contract  documents.  Tender,  construction,  financial  and  summary \ntechnical information will be disclosed on the project website to be developed after the grant \neffectiveness, in the local government offices, and on notice boards at the project site. \n \n ", "22  \nB.

The urban sector of Mongolia is small and is characterized by the primacy of Ulaanbaatar, and \nsevere disparities in levels of urban service provision between the central formally planned (apartment) \nareas and peripheral unplanned (ger [traditional felt tent]) areas. The national urban population is about \n1.6 million, or 61% of the total population of 2.6 million, with 1.03 million (almost two-thirds of the urban \ntotal) living in Ulaanbaatar. Since 1990, almost all urban growth has been absorbed by Ulaanbaatar, \nwhich grew at 2.6% since 2004, compared to less than 1% in other urban centers. With sustained \neconomic growth, urban poverty has been decreasing, with the reported incidence falling from 38% in \n2001 to 27% in 2006, although poverty incidence in aimag (province) and soum (district) centers \nremains at about 37%.   \n2.  An estimated 50% of the urban population have access to household water supplies through \ncentralized distribution networks in planned areas 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whereas ger areas \nrely largely on water kiosks served through the distribution network or by tanker. Here water usage \naverages 7\u201310 liters per capita per day, less than half the minimum recommended by the World Health \nOrganization. Only central areas are sewered, with ger areas relying almost exclusively on unimproved \nopen pit latrines or open field defecation. In the subsectors of solid-waste management, district heating, \nand hot water supply, a similar disparity exists between adequate service in planned areas and no \nservice in ger areas. In addition, ineffective design and lack of maintenance means that many of the \npiped networks within planned areas are in urgent need of rehabilitation. \n3.  The project area of Southeast Gobi has a total population of about 50,000, but is set to \nexperience rapid growth in its urban population as a result of the influx associated with trade and \nmining investments. Efforts to reach a clear policy and strategic framework for the future development \nof the urban sector in Southeast Gobi are compromised by institutional fragmentation and a lack of \nconsensus across government departments and other stakeholders. The National Development and \nInnovation  Committee  (NDIC)  and  the  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban \nDevelopment (MRTCUD) are each carrying out work on aspects of the subregional strategy. The \nMRTCUD is in the process of finalizing a subregional plan for the Gobi region covering Omnogovi, \nDornogovi, and Dundgovi aimags, while simultaneously undergoing reorganization in an attempt to \nbetter align its functions to the requirements of the sector. The MRTCUD needs to redefine its role as a \nfacilitator and regulator of urban development rather than an implementer. The NDIC has prepared a \nstrategy for the development of infrastructure (including urban infrastructure) in South Gobi, which is \nawaiting cabinet approval. \n4.  Major sector issues include (i) a distorted and poorly functioning urban planning system and \nland market; (ii) a lack of rigor, transparency, and accountability in urban planning and investment \ndecision making; (iii) a deficiency in the availability, quality, and coverage of urban infrastructure and \nservices, especially in ger areas; (iv) inadequate cost recovery and poor financial management of \npublic services; (v) lack of capacity of local governments to plan, and through the service organizations \nto provide and operate, urban infrastructure and facilities; (vi) inadequate focus on urban environmental \nproblems, particularly in Ulaanbaatar; and (xiii) inadequate attention to, and allocation of sufficient \nresources for, maintenance of key infrastructure assets. \n5.  In  the  project  aimags  of  Dornogovi  and  Omnogovi,  only  the  three  largest  settlements  of \nDalanzadgad, Saynshand, and Zamyn-Uud have formal infrastructure services in the form of piped \nwater supply, sewerage, and district heating networks. These are supplied only to formal housing areas \nand coverage is still limited as shown in Table A2.1. There is also a marked difference in the levels of \nservice provided to formal housing areas and ger areas in these towns. Not only do the formal housing \n   \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \n \nareas receive better services, but they also usually pay less for the services provided (Supplementary \nAppendixes B and J). \n \nTable A2.1: Infrastructure and Service Provision Objectives \nWater Supply  Sewerage  District Heating \n2008   (% served with  (% served with  (% served with \nTown  Population  household connections)  household connections)  household connections) \nDalanzadgad  15,000  46  36  35 \nSaynshand  19,900  36  35  35 \nZamyn-Uud  11,600  5a  3  5 \na  ADB estimate: figure not available. \nSource: Aimag and soum public urban service organizations   \n6.  Apart from small district heating units that serve government offices and educational and health \nfacilities, and a water supply system in Zuunbayan, all the other smaller soum settlements in Southeast \nGobi have no formal network infrastructure. However, as all water is groundwater, all town dwellers \npurchase water supplied by government from bore wells. The issue is that some urban ger dwellers \nhave to travel more than 1 kilometer to collect water. \n7.  A major constraint on providing sufficient levels of infrastructure service to gers is the low \ndensities, which make service provision expensive. This is exacerbated by climatic conditions where \nthe very cold winter months preclude even the provision of yard standposts for water supply to ger \ndwellers as the pipes would freeze unless insulated and heated during winter. Indoor connections are \nonly viable for formal housing and are generally impractical in gers.  \n8.  As there is no perennial surface water near the towns, nearly all water in urban areas is \npurchased. In the three large towns, water is pumped from bore wells close to the town, treated to \nreduce hardness, chlorinated, and pumped to reservoir tanks which serve the town with a continuous \nwater supply service. In contrast, the kiosks that serve those living in ger areas are often only open for \na few hours per day on certain days of the week.   \n9.  Most of the formal apartment areas in the three larger project towns have sewerage coverage. \nThere is no wastewater system in the three smaller project towns and in the ger areas of the larger \ntowns. Nearly all families living in these areas use outside dry pit latrines and, due to the lack of water \nconnections, there are practically no water-sealed latrines in use. In the smaller towns, even institutions \nsuch as offices, hospitals, and school dormitories use unsanitary dry pit latrines. Not all of the formal \nhousing is connected to sewers, and some large medium-density housing areas still use outdoor pit \nlatrines.  All  three  of  the  large  towns  have  wastewater  treatment  plants  which  use  simple  waste \nstabilization pond technology. The effluent from all plants is disposed of to the desert, which does not \ncause too much of an environmental problem as there is no habitation around these ponds and the \ndesert can readily absorb the relatively low flows.  \n10.  District heating is provided in all six towns\u2014in the three larger towns, to a combination of \ndomestic users, government offices, and commercial properties; in the three smaller towns the district \nheating systems only supply government institutions and one or two commercial enterprises. In some \nof the large towns, limited hot water supply is also provided along with the heating system. All heating \nsystems are based on old Russian-style systems with coal-fired boilers pumping heated water or steam \nto a high-pressure closed system. The heating is then taken to indoor radiators through separate lower-\n   \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \npressure hot water systems heated by conduction in an exchanger from the high-pressure system. The \nboilers in most of the systems are outdated and have very low efficiency.  \n11.  In Dornogovi, both Saynshand and Zamyn-Uud are connected to the national grid through a \n220 kilovolt-ampere line, which runs from Choyr to Zamyn-Uud. Zamyn-Uud also previously imported \npower from the People's Republic of China (PRC). None of Omnogovi aimag is connected to the \nnational grid, although Dalanzadgad has a large power station operated by the Ministry of Mineral \nResources and Energy, and most gers, houses, and all apartments have power connections. Of the \nsmaller towns, Gurvan Tes is connected to a 6,000 kilovolt line built by Qinhua MAK mining company, \nwhich imports power from the PRC. In Tsogttsetsii and Hanbogd the power supply is met through \ndiesel generators and is only provided for a few hours per day due to lack of fuel. Street lighting is \nprovided by the soums where power is available.  \n12.  Only the three larger towns have surfaced intra-urban roads, restricted to the formal central \nareas. The three smaller towns are served only by dirt roads, and there are no continuous asphalt \nconcrete roads linking any of the towns or linking them to Ulaanbaatar, although Zamyn-Uud has an \nasphalt concrete road linking it to the PRC.  \n13.  The frequency and extent of solid-waste collection varies across the towns. In the formal areas, \ncollection is daily or biweekly, with some areas also having communal containers. In the ger areas, \ncollection is less frequent and in the small towns it may be carried out only once or twice every \n3 months. All towns have garbage disposal sites, some of which are fenced, although none are close to \nbeing considered sanitary landfills. Recycling is carried out informally, apart from Dalanzadgad where \nthere  is  a  public  utility  services  organization  (PUSO)-operated  recycling  yard.  The  seminomadic \nlifestyles of the ger dwellers mean that not much waste is generated and significant in-house recycling, \nor use of waste for fuel, takes place.  \n14.  The aimag and soum governments are responsible for service provision, including water supply, \nwastewater management, district heating, and solid-waste management (in some aimags). These are \nprovided through PUSOs which were created from various enterprises established to provide services \nunder the previous communist system. The PUSOs were meant to be self-financing, but they have \ndifficulty in setting cost-recovery tariffs since revisions to existing tariff require approval of aimag \ngovernments. Mini-PUSOs or heating companies operating in the small towns in Omnogovi do so quite \nindependently of the PUSO and are regulated by an aimag coordination committee. In Dornogovi, the \ninstitutional arrangements for service delivery have developed in a more ad hoc manner. As both \nSaynshand and Zamyn-Uud initially developed in the 1950s as railway townships, the railway company \nprovided all the municipal services.

Several development partners are active in the urban sector in Mongolia, notably the World \nBank (integrated urban development, ger [traditional felt tent] area development, and urban air \nquality), Japan International Cooperation Agency (water supply, and urban planning and transport \nin Ulaanbaatar), and German development cooperation through GTZ (urban environment and \nenergy efficiency). The World Bank prepared the Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy1 in \n2008\u20132009, which focused on infrastructure and institutional needs in Omnogovi and brought \nstakeholders together to discuss these. It is preparing a technical assistance project that will seek \nto stimulate private investment to support mining activities and build local capacity to prepare \ntransactions for private sector participation in infrastructure. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting several ongoing and planned activities in \nSoutheast Gobi. About $1.3 million has gone into rehabilitating basic urban services in Saynshand \nand Dalanzadgad. More than $1 million has been invested in Omnogovi aimag (province) and $0.5 \nmillion in Dornogovi aimag in rehabilitating schools, providing textbooks and tool kits, and training \nteachers; $1.3 million has been invested in Dornogovi aimag in rehabilitating and constructing \naimag  and  soum  (district)  hospitals,  capacity  building  and  training,  and  providing  medical \nequipment and motorbikes. In 2009 an advisory technical assistance project started which is \nsupporting HIV/AIDS Prevention in ADB Infrastructure Projects and the Mining Sector.

Groundwater Monitoring in Southeast Gobi \n \n3.  Southeast Gobi is largely arid and its population centers depend entirely on groundwater \nfrom shallow aquifers. Mining companies have developed bore fields to exploit deep aquifers for \nindustrial use near Tsogttsetsii and Hanbogd, and plan to provide bulk water to the local population. \nBased  on  studies  undertaken  by  two  private  mining  companies  (Ivanhoe  Mines  and  Energy \nResources, the deep aquifers they will tap for industrial needs are not linked with the shallow \naquifers accessed by existing and proposed wells to provide potable supplies.  \n \n4.  Despite indications that there is no linkage between shallow and deep aquifers in this \nregion, the importance of these resources for sustainable development underscores the need for a \nviable groundwater monitoring system. The World Bank is initiating work on new institutional \narrangements for groundwater monitoring, which by the end of 2010 will prepare a groundwater \nmanagement  plan  for  the  South  Gobi  hydrological  region  (which  includes  Omnogovi  and \nDornogovi), develop a framework for integrated groundwater management, advise on requisite \npolicy and legislative needs and the establishment of a new groundwater management center in \nthe region in 2011. In 2010 Oyu Tolgoi (the company that is developing and mining the Oyu Tolgoi \ncopper deposit) will begin a substantial groundwater monitoring program in the area near Hanbogd \nand has committed to an approach that involves local stakeholders and ensures transparency. \nEnergy Resources is expected to implement a similar groundwater monitoring program in the area \nnear Tavan Tolgoi and around points of groundwater abstraction commencing in 2010.  \n \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \n \n5.  A groundwater monitoring system is needed to ensure that information about the impact of \nabstraction  by  the  mining  industry  can  be  used  in  environmental  planning,  future  mining \ndevelopment, pasture management, and urban development. The initiatives of the World Bank and \nmining companies will together address this need across Southeast Gobi. Review missions for the \nproposed project will address the issue on a regular basis. The project management unit will \nensure  coordination  with  the  National  Water  Committee  and  any  future  water  resources \nmanagement agency.  \n \n6.  As part of due diligence, the project will establish sustainable groundwater yields of water \nsupply wells, confirm absence of conflicts between existing water users, conduct testing and \nanalysis  of  drinking  water  quality,  and  obtain  water  extraction  and  development  permits,  as \nnecessary. \n \nC.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n \n7.  Key development partners engaged in the urban sector (including the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, German development cooperation through GTZ, and the World Bank) are \nmembers of the Urban Development Working Group (UDWG)  whose mandate is to facilitate \ndialogue and coordinate assistance. The UDWG is chaired by the minister of roads, transport, \nconstruction and urban development, and cochaired by the governments of Germany and Japan. It \nmeets on a quarterly basis. Development partners also coordinate bilaterally and multilaterally on \nspecific subsector issues, such as urban planning for Ulaanbaatar, or water sector reform and \nregulation. \n \nD.  Achievements and Issues  \n \n8.  Through bilateral coordination and the UDWG mechanism, development partners have \nachieved a consensus on the need for improved urban planning and reform of key municipal \nservices. Furthermore, there is effective coordination regarding subsector priorities and activities. \nAn example of this has been seen in the closely coordinated and interlinked activities of ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  the  Millennium \nChallenge Corporation in addressing air pollution in Ulaanbaatar. In Omnogovi, the World Bank \nand ADB have had frequent dialogue concerning regional planning, groundwater management and \nmonitoring, infrastructure needs, and policy reform. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  39 \n  f Total e Cost 70.7 13.4 15.9 100.0 3.5 20.3 23.8 12.4 136.2  \n  os\n% Ba\notalost 356 150 548 054 568 254 822 988 864\nTC 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 1, 1,\n1 1 2\n000)   Localrrency 11,356 21 868 12,245 568 2,672 3,240 1,988 17,473\n$' Cu\n(\ny \nr\no ne 0 9 0 9 2 2 1\ng gg 0 2 8 0 8 8 9\nCate Foreichan 0.0 2,1 1,6 3,8 5 5 4,3\n  x\ne E\nr\nu\nit  \nd\n MATES y Expen Total Cost   15,904.2  3,011.6  3,569.4  22,485.2    795.8  4,555.6  5,351.4  2,783.2  30,619.8 \nTI b\n COST ES Estimates  NT million   LocalCurrency 15,904.2 30.1 1,216.2 17,150.4 795.8 3,740.8 4,536.6 2,783.2 24,470.2\nED st  M\nDETAIL Detailed Co ForeignExchange 0.000 2,981.5 2,353.3      5,334.8         814.8 814.8 6,149.6  nt base costs ocal costs \n1:  meof l\n. e% \nTable A4 m aBase Costs  1.

At present \nthe capacity of both aimag (province) and soum (district) governments to respond to citizen\u2019s \ndemands, and initiate, plan, deliver, and manage urban infrastructure development and improved \nservice delivery, is limited. Local governments have limited financial and technical resources, an \nabsence of systems, few staff, and inadequate capacity to effectively carry out these tasks. At the \nsame time, although the executing agency\u2014the Ministry of Roads, Transport, Construction and \nUrban  Development\u2014has  experience  in  the  execution  of  urban  development  projects,  it  has \npreviously performed as both executing and implementing agency, delivering completed projects to \nlocal governments and providing little in the way of technical assistance, capacity building, or \ntraining  to  assist  local  governments  to  develop  their  own  urban  planning  and  management \ncapability. The project needs to support a shift in responsibility for urban planning, management, \nand delivery of local infrastructure from the national government to local governments, with the \nministry moving to a regulatory, facilitating, and supporting role in the sector.  \n2.  The quality, coverage, and reliability of service delivery at the aimag level are constrained \nby existing service delivery arrangements. The public urban service organizations (PUSOs) are just \ncoping  in  maintaining  existing  levels  of  service  and  are  not  in  a  position  to  expand  service \ncoverage  to  meet  expected  demand  for  services  and  infrastructure.  They  are  guided  by \nmanagement contracts that lack specificity on service quality and coverage, dispute resolution, and \nremuneration; struggle to recover operating and maintenance costs; and lack access to training \nand managerial expertise. The most fundamental constraint is low tariffs; PUSOs\u2019 requests for \nincreases to enable routine operating and maintenance costs to be recovered are often rejected by \nthe aimag Citizens' Representatives Khural1 due to the political unpopularity of such adjustments. \nThe  project  presents  an  opportunity  to  introduce  fundamental  changes  to  the  institutional \nframework for municipal service provision and its regulation through (i) divesting all or part of \nPUSOs so as to decouple service providers from local government administration and attract \nprivate capital and expertise; (ii) introducing an operating management contract that provides \nperformance-based  incentives  for  the  service  provider;  and  (iii)  establishing  a  regulatory \nmechanism at a central level, which links tariffs with the prices of key inputs and avoids political \ninvolvement in tariff setting.  \n3.  To support this institutional development and reform, it is proposed under part A of the \nproject to use the project itself as a vehicle to bring about this change. The proposed project thus \nadopts a \u201cdrivers of change\u201d-type of approach, whereby the reform and institutional development \nactions  required  to  underpin  the  execution  of  the  sector  road  map,  and  thus  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-supported project, form an integral part of the project itself. It is intended \nthat execution of the project will help to drive change in policy areas that are closely related to \nproject  execution\u2014the  role  of  national  and  local  government  in  urban  development,  urban \nplanning, service delivery, and local government finance\u2014in addition to project management and \nsupervision. \n4.  Part A of the project will provide financial and technical assistance, consulting services, and \ntraining  to  both  national  and  local  governments  to  (i)  ensure  effective  project  execution  and \nimplementation (including project benefit evaluation and monitoring); (ii) build local government \ncapacity in urban governance, planning, development and management, and sustainable service \ndelivery; (iii) build urban planning capacity at national and local levels and support preparation of \nstructure plans for the project towns; (iv) provide transaction advice for the tendering of operating \nmanagement contracts for urban service delivery, and in establishing a regulator; and (v) ensuring \n                                                 \n1 Parliamentary body at the aimag level. \n ", "42   Appendix 5 \n \ncompliance  with  project  safeguards.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan \n \n1.  The construction of a connector road in Hanbogd is a priority infrastructure improvement of \nthe  infrastructure  development  component  (part  B  of  the  project).  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts of this priority infrastructure improvement are minimized by acquiring four \nresidential plots and relocating affected households on-site, thus avoid affecting the socioeconomic \nsetting and social organization of the affected persons. Three households on two plots, including a \nlessee, will be displaced; two households on the other two plots will lose land partially, and two \nlessees on the other two plots will be relocated. No productive assets and income sources are lost. \nThe estimated number of persons affected by this priority infrastructure improvement is 26 from a \ntotal of seven households. The land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) is in Supplementary \nAppendix N. \n \n2.  Of a total of seven households, two households will each lose their entire 750 square \nmeters  (m2)  of  owned  land  and  will  be  allocated  land  on-site  (close  to  existing  plots).  One \nhousehold will lose one-third of owned land and will be compensated equivalent to the size of the \nland to be acquired. One household that occupies a 1,232 m2 plot (out of which 166 m2 or 13% is \nnontitled) will lose the nontitled land. In terms of structures, five gers (traditional felt tents), six \nsheds, and 237 meters of wooden fence will be permanently displaced. Owners and lessees who \nneed to relocate their gers and other light structures shall be provided with financial assistance. All \naffected households will be compensated in accordance with the entitlement matrix in the LARP.  \n \n3.  Compensation to the affected persons will be paid in full prior to the possession of the land \nand the award of civil works contracts. A resettlement budget of $53,086 including contingencies is \nprovided. An implementation schedule indicates milestones within an approximate time frame.  \n \n4.  Information  dissemination  and  consultation  has  already  begun  and  will  continue.  All \naffected household heads participated in a consultation meeting on 7 June 2009 held in Hanbogd. \nThis was followed by individual meetings and interviews with affected persons. The contents of the \nLARP were discussed. The LARP has been translated into Mongolian and made available at the \nsoum (district) governor\u2019s office in Hanbogd for public reference. A grievance redress mechanism \nhas been stipulated in the LARP and was explained to the affected persons during the consultation \nmeetings. \n \n5.  Monitoring and evaluation will include internal and external monitoring. Internal monitoring \nwill be carried out by the Omnogovi project implementation unit (PIU). The PIU will submit internal \nmonitoring  reports  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  executing  agency  at  monthly \nintervals during the LARP implementation. An independent consultant will be appointed to (i) \nconduct  external  monitoring  during  and  after  LARP  implementation;  (ii)  submit  reports \nsemiannually  to  the  PIU,  PMU,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  (iii)  evaluate  the \nresettlement  effectiveness  and  impact  and  sustainability  of  resettlement  entitlements;  and \n(iv) identify  strategic  lessons  for  future  policy  formulation  and  planning.  Internal  and  external \nmonitoring reports and evaluations will be sent to ADB headquarters through ADB\u2019s Mongolia \nResident Mission for review. The project midterm review will include a separate section on the \nprogress of LARP implementation. Upon completion of land acquisition and resettlement activities \nin the project components, the project aimags (provinces) will prepare resettlement completion \nreports for submission to ADB. The PMU will be responsible for engaging an evaluation and \nmonitoring agency, which will investigate, monitor, and evaluate LARP implementation in all project \ncomponents over a 3-year period and report to the PMU and ADB. \n ", "Appendix 10  53 \n \n \n6.   With the exception of the two households headed by women identified as vulnerable \nhouseholds  requiring  special  assistance,  no  adverse  impact  on  either  men  or  on  women  is \nexpected from the construction of the road.  \n \n7.  No indigenous people were found living in the subproject area and therefore there are no \naffected persons identified in this category. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n \n8.  While no additional land acquisition and resettlement impacts are expected in other priority \ninfrastructure  improvements  under  the  project,  the  rapid  population  influx  and  economic \ndevelopment in the project area raises the possibility that unforeseen impacts may occur. For this \nreason, a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF), prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement,1 has been prepared and is in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n9.  The  LARF\u2019s  provisions  and  stipulations  are  applicable  to  all  project  components.  It \nestablishes a policy framework for compensation eligibility and entitlements for all types of affected \npersons. It outlines the necessary steps to prepare satisfactory LARPs for project components that \nhave land acquisition and resettlement impacts and stipulates arrangements for consultation and \npublic participation, grievance redress, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n10.  Land acquisition and resettlement by the government for local-scale projects in urban areas \nis  based  on  negotiation  and  contracts  with  affected  persons  according  to  the  Civil  Code  of \nMongolia.  The  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  recognizes  negotiated  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  as  long  as  there  are  willing  and  free  buyers  and  sellers,  and  eligibility  and \nentitlements are clearly defined and agreed. All affected persons are eligible for entitlements, as \nstipulated in the LARF for the project, including owners, possessors, users, legalizable occupants, \nnontitled occupants and lessees. The eviction of unlicensed affected persons is a violation of the \nADB Safeguard Policy Statement. All affected persons who are unlicensed occupants of land in \nger areas designated for land allocation are treated as legalizable under the LARF for the project. \n \n11.  The  LARF  stipulates  a  detailed  procedure  for  the  preparation  of  a  LARP,  including \nidentification  of  the  scope,  field  verification,  notification  of  a  cut-off  date,  census  and \nsocioeconomic survey, contract negotiations with affected persons, as well as LARP disclosure \nand  consultation  meetings  with  affected  persons.  The  aimag  and  soum  governments  are \nresponsible for the preparation of LARPs, through their respective PIUs. All LARPs will meet \nrequirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and closely follow the provisions of the \nLARF. \n \n12.  Aimag  working  groups  formed  within  each  aimag  to  guide  and  monitor  project \nimplementation will be responsible for implementing the LARPs. The local PIUs will assist the \nworking  groups  and  ensure  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  safeguard  compliance  and \nsubmission of satisfactory LARPs to PMU and ADB. The working group members will ensure close \ncoordination between all project stakeholders. The PIUs will conduct a series of training workshops \nto inform members of the working groups about the requirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and LARF and LARP implementation. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Information for, consultation with, and participation of affected persons are ensured through \nindividual and public meetings throughout the LARP preparation and implementation process, \nduring which their rights and entitlements, including grievance procedures, are fully explained and \ndiscussed. Drafts of the LARPs in Mongolian are disclosed, discussed, and amended in the public \nconsultation meetings and final LARPs are published on the ADB website and on display at the \nrelevant bag2 offices. \n \n14.  A grievance action form has been designed to cover the various aspects addressed by the \nLARPs and used in the grievance redressal process to log and follow-up any grievance. A four-\nstep grievance mechanism with a 5-week time line for each case will be set up, for which the aimag \nworking groups, aimag and soum governors, and the Land Acquisition Directorate are responsible. \nGrievances not resolved by grievance redressal mechanisms are referred to the courts. \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Smallest administrative unit in Mongolia.  \n ", "Appendix 11  55 \n \nFLOW OF FUNDS \n \nA portion of the proceeds of the grant will be extended by the recipient, through the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), to participating aimag (province) governments.  \n \n                       \n                                 \n               \nAsian Development Bank \n               \n                     \nnt \n         Gra             \n                     \n               \nMongolia (Ministry of Finance) \n               \n              b-grant eement                     \n         SuAgr             \n                  \n                   \n                \nAimag Government \n             \n                 \n \n ", "56   Appendix 12 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: Mongolia: Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  East Asia Department \nProject/Grant \nModality:  Division:  Mongolia Resident Mission \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe project has been identified and prepared based on (i) the National Development Strategy and ADB-supported urban \nsector road map; (ii) the World Bank-supported report on the Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy (and particularly \nsections on Housing and Urban Infrastructure); (iii) the government\u2019s development plans for the infrastructure development  \nin Southern Gobi prepared by the NDIC; (iv) planned logistics infrastructure development at Zamyn-Uud and other border \ncrossings; (v) the Land Management Plan for the \u201cGalbyn Gobi\u201d micro-regional development concept prepared under the \nguidance of the MRTCUD; (vi) urban development master plans and investment plans prepared for aimag centers and key \nsoum centers in the region; and (vii) meetings and workshops with government officials, the private sector, and other \nstakeholders including town residents. \n \nAn urban development plan for the subregion has been prepared which sets out the development goals and objectives for \nurban development in 2010-2015, and identifies investments to achieve these objectives. Based on the plan, an institutional \nreform and development framework has been developed which will support effective planning, financing, and operation of \nurban infrastructure and services. This sets out specific reforms, associated capacity development, and a timetable for \nimplementation. Emphasis is placed on (i) improving local governance and urban planning and management capacity, (ii) \nimproving the institutional and contractual arrangements for service provision, (iii) enhancing urban planning systems and \ncapacities at national and local levels, and (iv) minimizing recurrent expenditures and establishing clear accountability for the \nperformance of contractors and service providers. \n \nThe project is designed to have multidimensional impacts on poverty reduction by improving infrastructure and services, \nreducing time spent in water collection, creating direct employment for construction and indirect long-term income-generating \nopportunities, and empowering poor residents in decision-making processes through improved urban governance. The \nproject will have positive health benefits. Residents are expected to experience a reduction in the incidence of water- and \nvector-borne diseases and medical costs, and lost earning opportunities incurred as a result of these diseases.  \n \nIt is anticipated that the sector reforms will result in tariff increases for water supply, wastewater management, and district \nheating in order to enable the service providers to recover sufficient costs to cover operational expenditures. The impact of \ntariff increases on the poor is not serious because (i) financial analysis shows that increased tariffs would still remain within \naffordability and willingness-to-pay levels; and (ii) the poor live predominantly in ger areas, which do not benefit from \nsewerage or district heating, and where potable water is carried from water kiosks, resulting in low levels of consumption.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n \nKey issues. The project is primarily designed to improve the urban infrastructure and services of selected aimag and soum \ncenters in Dornogovi and Omnogovi aimags. The key focus of the project will be to provide urban infrastructure and services \nto the project aimag and soum centers to improve the quality, reliability, and coverage of urban services to existing \ncommunities and to serve incoming populations.  \n \nAll the soum centers are projected to experience a significant influx of people, mostly driven by the growth of mining jobs and \nassociated infrastructure in the area, and the resulting growth in cross-border trade with the PRC. Consequently, existing \nurban infrastructure and services, which are already deficient, will become still less adequate. Population expansion will lead \nto growth in service industries provided that barriers to access to job opportunities are removed. \n \nThe project thus aims to improve urban infrastructure and service  provision so as to contribute toward the overall \nenhancement of urban service quality and coverage in the soum centers. The project will contribute to improved access to \nservices and better quality of life for the project beneficiaries, thereby alleviating those aspects of human poverty.  \n \nDesign  features. It is anticipated that the sector reforms will result in tariff increases for water supply, wastewater \nmanagement,  and  district  heating  to  enable  the  service  providers  to  recover  sufficient  costs  to  cover  operational \nexpenditures. The poor live predominantly in ger areas, which do not have sewerage or district heating services. Potable \nwater is carried from water kiosks, the number of which will be increased under part B of the project, thus reducing the time \n ", "Appendix 12  57 \n \ntaken to collect water.     \n \nA community consultation and participation framework has been prepared for the project to ensure the participation of the \ncommunity, including women, in project planning and implementation. Contacts and dialogue with the beneficiaries built up \nduring the public consultation phase can be used as a basis to form infrastructure project implementation committees (one \nper soum center). The composition of these committees will include equal numbers of working-age women and men and will \ninclude representatives from low-income households. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey issues. The key poverty aspect which is applicable in the urban context focuses on deprivation through limited or no \naccess to basic urban services. The infrastructure improvements made under this project include new or improved access to \ndrinking  water,  district  heating,  sewerage,  electricity,  solid-waste  management,  and  secondary  paved  roads.  Each \nbeneficiary community includes low-income households.   \n \nResidents living in gers and some houses who will not be connected to piped services will nonetheless benefit from the \nimprovements to public health brought about by water supply improvements through kiosks, and improved sanitation in \nschools, clinics, and other institutions. The entire population will benefit from a cleaner and less dusty urban environment. \nImproved services will also help stimulate business growth and income generation, provided that the safeguards of \nvocational training are also implemented. Forty two project components have been prepared in the aimag centers of \nDalanzadgad and Saynshand, and in the soum centers of Zamyn-Uud, Gurvantes, Tsogttsetsii, and Hanbogd. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation  \n \nConsultation and participation during project implementation and monitoring will involve the following:  \n \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \nWas a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \n Project stakeholders include the central and local governments; institutions such as schools, kindergartens, and clinics; \nbeneficiary populations living in apartments, houses, and gers; and small-business proprietors and future mining employees \nwho will live in the project areas. During project preparation, discussions were undertaken with project beneficiaries. Particular \nattention was paid to ensuring participation of residents of the various dwelling types (some living in formal areas with access \nto a range of network services, others living in informal ger areas with limited access to services) and which have \nsocioeconomically vulnerable households headed by women and other low-income households, so as to receive their views \nand opinions on the project.  \n \nThe primary aim of all these discussions was to (i) inform the communities and population about the proposed project \nintervention; (ii) get a better understanding of the prevailing conditions and coping mechanisms related to access to urban \nservices, in particular in relation to the poor and to women; and (iii) get wider public input and suggestions from stakeholders \non the project intervention, particularly the priority and levels of affordability with regard to the infrastructure offered.  \n \nThese discussions and consultations confirmed the need for the project. There was a positive response from all stakeholders \namong all socioeconomic groups toward the project. The key benefits of the project as voiced by the stakeholders are (i) \nbetter service provision will reduce drudgery involved in collecting water for drinking, cooking, and hygiene, particularly in the \ncase of women and children; (ii) improved sewage disposal and waste management will support increased cleanliness and \nhygiene, and reduced waterborne diseases in institutions and in the home; (iii) other services will provide improved urban \namenity and living conditions, and a healthier and less dusty public environment; and (iv) improved heating will lead to \nincreased productivity within dwellings.  \n \nFuture public consultations and disclosure will be held during detailed engineering design, construction, and operational \nstages. The PMU, PIUs, and soum project inspectors will be responsible for addressing any concerns and issues raised by \nproject beneficiary communities, regular meetings with infrastructure project implementation committees, and instituting the \nnecessary changes or additions in project management and environmental or social mitigation measures. These shall follow \nthe general guidelines of (i) all stakeholders should be invited and encouraged to participate in the consultation workshops; \n(ii) suggestions from the general public may be sought through the mass media, when necessary; and (iii) the PIUs, aimag \nand soum project and environmental inspectors, contractor, and/or operator should meet with and be responsive to the public \non matters concerning the progress of the projects, adverse social or environmental impacts, effective mitigation measures, \nand quality of monitoring and supervision. \n ", "58   Appendix 12 \n \n \nInformation disclosed to date includes project objectives and components; proposed subprojects and subcomponents; \nproposed implementation arrangements; and environmental, social, land acquisition, and resettlement requirements of the \nproject following the disclosure and safeguard policies of the Government of Mongolia and the ADB. \n \nFuture public consultation will include involvement in monitoring impacts and mitigation measures during construction and \noperation, evaluating environmental and economic benefits and social impacts, and interviewing the public after the project is \ncompleted. The soum and aimag governments will establish and operate a social and environmental complaints and \ngrievance  procedure  to  facilitate  the  identification  and  resolution  of  project  implementation  issues  that  concern  the \nbeneficiaries or any affected person. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey issues. To understand gender-specific roles, gender status, needs, and problems within the selected aimag and soum \ncenters, a process of female and male focus group consultations was undertaken. These comprised women and men \nbelonging to various socioeconomic categories in the subproject areas. The topics discussed included the likely gender \nimpacts of the project in terms of women\u2019s and men\u2019s traditional roles. Future employment expectations were also discussed. \nThese discussions aimed to capture women\u2019s and men\u2019s collective perceptions about social, economic, and cultural norms; \ntheir ability to access and afford the future new services; and prospects for future employment in their areas.  \n \nThe discussions with the women indicated that the improvements to urban services, particularly water supply and heating, will \nhave significant positive impacts in relieving the burden of housework, while at the same time freeing up time to engage in \nother of income-generating activities. This requires certain measures to be put in place, including (i) water supply and other \nmunicipal services which would give women more time for productive endeavors, empowerment activities, and leisure; and (ii) \nimprovements to heating which would improve their mobility and productivity within their dwellings in winter.   \n \nThe men were interested in increased income-generation potential that improved water supply and other services will bring. In \nparticular, opportunities for horticulture and a variety of workshop activities will be increased. \n \nThe forecast rapid population influx, initially of unaccompanied men, brought about by the new economic development, \n(although not directly resulting from this project), has potential negative impacts, particularly on women. Project measures \nhave been formulated to ensure that absorptive capacity of project benefits by women will not decrease. For example, \nvocational training and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention will be provided under part A to (i) protect adolescent women and \nlow-income or unskilled women from being forced into prostitution and cross-border trafficking; and (ii) ensure that women will \nbe able to take advantage of the new amenities and business opportunities directly and indirectly afforded by project \nimprovements.  \n \nKey actions. Measures are included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities; participation in decision-making process; and access to \nemployment and training activities. A gender action plan has been prepared with key actions to ensure and measure women's \nparticipation in decision making and consultation. Implementation of the gender action plan, which is included as an \nassurance, will be the responsibility of the PMU which will work with the PIUs to measure indicators and achieve targets. The \nMongolia Resident Mission gender specialist will support PMU and PIU staff during implementation. \n \n Gender action plan          Other actions or measures         No action or measure  \nIII.
