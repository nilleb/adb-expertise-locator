Global evidence demonstrates that \nimmunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions, and a corner \nstone  of  good  public  health.1 The  project  will  reduce  the  burden  of  disease  of  pneumonia  and \ndiarrhea in children, minimize outbreaks related to vaccine-preventable diseases, decrease the \nincidence of cervical cancer, integrate immunization programs into broader health systems, and \nimprove equity in access to primary health services. It will promote country ownership in providing \neffective immunization services and access to affordable prices for quality-assured safe vaccines \nand  cold  chain  products  through  pooled  procurement  and  partnerships.  The  project  will  also \nenable the four countries to invest in strengthening frontline service delivery through evidence-\nbased planning and decision-making to enhance the sustainability of immunization programs and \npromote  innovations  through  regional  exchanges.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  Pacific \nApproach 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and aligns with ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan for Health 2015-2020.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nPacific context. The Pacific region is composed of numerous small island nations that \nare  geographically  isolated  and  face  various  human  and  resource  constraints.  Their  diverse \neconomic  growth  led  to  a  high  level  of  regional  and  extra-regional  migration,  making  them \nvulnerable to imported diseases and other regional health security (RHS) threats.3 Despite these \nchallenges, many Pacific countries made significant progress toward the Millennium Development \nGoal 4 of reducing child mortality (32% regional reduction since 1990).4 These achievements can \nbe attributed in part to well-established primary health care systems with high coverage of routine \nvaccination  programs.5 Widening  access  to  immunization  programs  is  a  shared  responsibility \nacross  countries  and  ensuring  the  timely  supply  of  vaccines  form  part  of  public  health \npreparedness capacities necessary to meet the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and \nPublic Health Emergencies III recommendations.6 \n \n\n                                                \n1   World Health Organization (WHO). 2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fHealth  service  delivery  and  financing  in  the  four  countries.  Health  services  are \n4. \npredominantly  provided  and  financed  by  the  governments;  their  share  of  current  health \nexpenditure ranges from 47% in Tonga to 96% in Tuvalu.7 The services are free, apart from small \nuser fees in Samoa and Vanuatu. Out-of-pocket spending on health is relatively low compared \nwith the region and globally. The capacity for diagnostic and specialist services (including cervical \ncancer screening and treatment) is limited, which results in overseas referrals at high cost to the \ngovernments, patients, and their families. Key development partners supporting the health sector \nin  the  four  countries  are  the World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF), and the governments of Australia and New Zealand.8 \n \n5. \nImmunization program. Routine immunization coverage in Tonga and Tuvalu is relatively \nhigh, while coverage rates in Samoa and Vanuatu are below international targets (greater than \n90%). 9  All  four  immunization  programs  are  procuring  vaccines  through  UNICEF\u2019s  vaccine \nindependence  initiative  (VII),  a  pooled  procurement  facility.  However,  the  programs  are \nincomplete because they lack three WHO-recommended routine vaccines: human papilloma virus \n(HPV) vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), and rotavirus vaccine.10 They are further \nweakened by outdated cold chain equipment to keep the vaccines at recommended temperatures, \nshortages in staff, and difficulties in reaching \u201cthe last mile\u201d to remote communities. \n \n6. \nCountry  commitment.  The  governments  of  Samoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu  are \ncommitted to improving child and adolescent health outcomes, as reflected in their various health \nstrategies: Samoa\u2019s fourth Health Sector Plan 2019\u20132029 (forthcoming); Tonga\u2019s National Health \nStrategic Plan 2015\u20132020; Tuvalu\u2019s Health Reform Strategy 2016\u20132019, and Vanuatu\u2019s Health \nSector  Strategy  2017\u20132020. 11  Common  elements  of  the  four  strategies  to  progress  toward \nuniversal  health  coverage  are  (i)  strengthening  equitable  access  and  efficiency  of  health \ninterventions,  (ii)  improving  the  capacity  of  health service  delivery,  and  (iii)  ensuring  evidence-\nbased  planning  through  better  information  systems.  The  5-year  project  will  support  the  four \ncountries in providing immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases to infants (0\u20132 years) \nand girls (9\u201314 years), resulting in covering more than 30% of the combined population. \n \n7. \nDisease  burden:  cervical  cancer.  Pacific  leaders  have  highlighted  the  need  for  HPV \nprograms to prevent cervical cancer,12 and the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum \nSecretariat  has  requested  assistance  from  ADB  to  alleviate  the  cervical  cancer  burden  in  the \nPacific.13 About  70%  of  all  cervical  cancer  cases  are  caused  by  the  sexually  transmitted  HPV \n\n                                                \n7   Tonga has a high share of external health expenditure at nearly 40% of current health expenditure. World Bank \n\ndata. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.OOPC.TO.ZS (accessed 16 July 2018). \n\n8   ADB signed a memorandum of understanding with each of WHO (27 August 2018) and UNICEF (11 October 2018) \n\nidentifying cooperation in strengthening health security and health systems. \n\n9  Reported national coverage of the third dose of the diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013pertussis vaccine is 94% in Tuvalu, 96% in \nTonga, 80%\u201385% in Samoa, and 64%\u201381% in Vanuatu.

A systematic review of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the Pacific region. Asian Pacific Journal \non Cancer Prevention. Vol. 15: pp. 943\u20139437. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftypes 16 and 18, both of which can be safely prevented by HPV vaccination.14 Cervical cancer is \nincreasing  in  incidence  and  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  in  women  in  most  Pacific \ncountries.15 Data  is  likely  an  underestimate  because  screening  programs  and  awareness  are \nlacking. \n \n8. \nDisease  burden:  pneumonia  and  diarrhea.  Globally,  pneumonia  and  diarrhea  are \namong the top three causes of mortality in children under 5 years of age, and about one-third of \nall  pneumonia  deaths  are  caused  by  the  pneumococcus  bacterium. 16  The  incidence  of \npneumococcal disease in Tonga was reported at 113 per 100,000 in children under the age of 2, \nwith  a  case  fatality  rate  of  25%,  significantly  higher  than  the  8.7%  reported  in  other  global \nsettings.17 Diarrhea is estimated to cause 2% of under-5 child deaths worldwide, with a rotavirus \nmortality  rate  of  1.5  per  100,000  children.18 Under-5  mortality  from  diarrhea  is  comparatively \nhigher in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, ranging from 3% in Tuvalu to 16% in Vanuatu.19 \nHospital data from the four countries suggest that pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading cause \nfor  the  admission  of  children.20 Both  conditions  are  preventable  through  rotavirus  vaccine  and \nPCV, along with other treatments such as antibiotics and oral rehydration solutions.21 \n \n9. \nProject design features. The project supports a comprehensive vaccination program by \nfinancing the introduction of the HPV and rotavirus vaccines and PCV into four health systems. \nIncreasing the immunization coverage will reduce inequities and poverty and help the countries \nachieve  Sustainable  Development  Goal  3  by  providing  timely  access  to  life-saving  vaccines. \nIntegrating  vaccine  programs  into  broader  primary  health  care  is  an  opportunity  to  strengthen \nhealth  sector  management  capacity  by  improving  evidence-based  planning  and  resource \nallocation,  which  will  increase  the  sustainability  of  immunization  and  primary  health  care.  The \nproject also addresses market failures through the positive externalities of herd immunity against \nthe  targeted  diseases.  Although  some  tiered  vaccine  pricing  exists,  the  cost  of  the  HPV  and \nrotavirus vaccines and PCV can be prohibitive for middle-income countries with small population \nsizes and thus weak individual purchasing power.22 As middle-income countries, they are unable \nto access global vaccine support through agencies such as Gavi.23 Pooled procurement through \nUNICEF\u2019s  VII  allows  countries  to  benefit  from  lower  prices,  quality  products,  and  technical \nexpertise in vaccines and cold chain management as well as emergency stockpiles. \n \n10. \n\nThe  project  will  be  funded  by  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  grant  resources, \n\n                                                \n14  F.T.

The \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by reducing health inequalities, progressing gender \nequality, and supporting regional cooperation.25 The project will benefit from ADB\u2019s experience in \nRHS  projects. 26  It  will  also  leverage  ADB\u2019s  extensive  experience  in  Papua  New  Guinea  in \nstrengthening  rural  health  systems  and,  more  recently,  ADB  support  in  Samoa,  Tonga,  and \nVanuatu for digital health information systems.27 \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) incidence and prevalence of cervical \n11. \ncancer in the Pacific region reduced (Healthy Islands Monitoring Framework) and (ii) healthy lives \nensured, and wellbeing for all ages promoted (Sustainable Development Goal 3).28 The project \nwill  have  the  following  outcome:  increased  immunization  coverage  of  HPV  vaccine,  PCV  and \nrotavirus vaccine meets the 90% vaccine coverage target set by the WHO Global Vaccine Action \nPlan (footnote 1). \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Regional  vaccine  procurement  strengthened.  This  output  will  support \nSamoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu to procure the HPV vaccine, PCV and the rotavirus vaccine \nthrough the VII. The project will implement a phased counterpart financing approach starting in \nyear 2 of the 5-year project, and the governments will ensure sustainability beyond the project. \nThe project will finance the countries\u2019 VII credit line in year 1 where required. In Tonga, the project \nwill  also  finance,  from  year  2,  the  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella  vaccine  through  phased \ncounterpart financing, replacing the current measles and rubella vaccine.29 The output will also \nsupport  the  procurement  of  cold  chain  equipment  and  associated  supplies  through  VII,  with \nperformance,  quality,  and  safety  certification  by  WHO  and  UNICEF.  The  output  will  support \nmicroplanning in at least 90% of health facilities, and national vaccine forecasting, which includes \nemergency  preparedness  planning  and  maintenance  of  a  buffer  stock.  Procurement  capacity \nbuilding will contribute to more effective planning and procurement of health commodities. \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Health systems strengthened. This output will use the introduction of vaccines \nto strengthen primary health care and reduce inequities in access to health services. It will support \n(i)  the  update  of  immunization  and  cold  chain  policies,  guidelines,  and  training  materials;  (ii) \n                                                \n24  ADB. 2016.

This represents less than 4% of Tonga\u2019s \n\nvaccine expenditure under the project. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\ftraining of health workers through workshops and on-the-job practice in vaccine administration, \nroutine and adverse-event reporting, waste management, preventative maintenance, supportive \nsupervision  and  supply  chain  management,  with  the  aim  to  achieve  less  than  10%  stock-outs \nnationally; (iii) capacity building of health staff in evidence-based planning, bottom-up budgeting \nfor routine integrated outreach with an equity focus; (iv) sex-disaggregated immunization reporting \nthat is integrated in the broader health information system; and (v) evidence generation through \nnationwide immunization coverage surveys and other surveys to assess the quality and equity of \nvaccine management. \n \n14. \nOutput 3: Community awareness improved. Leveraging existing community structures \nand  communication  channels,  this  output  will  assist  the  ministries  of  health  in  improving  the \npopulation\u2019s knowledge of and attitude toward vaccines. This will promote better health-seeking \nbehavior and vaccine acceptance. In doing so, it will seek partnerships with other ministries (e.g., \neducation and women\u2019s affairs), nongovernment and civil society organizations, community and \nchurch  leaders,  and  other  local  community  groups.  The  output  will  increase  community \nmobilization through context-specific targeted education and communication on the importance \nof vaccination, as well as other essential health promotion messages. \n \nD. \n \n15. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $29.66 million (Table 1). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nOutput 1: Regional vaccine procurement strengthened \nOutput 2: Health systems strengthened \nOutput 3: Community awareness improved \nProject monitoring and managementc \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n \nContingenciesd \nFinancial Charges During Implementatione \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $2.43 million.

The MOHs \nare responsible for the overall administration and financial management of the project and will be \nsupported  by  a  regional  integrated  project  management  (IPM)  team.  The  team  will  consist  of \nnational  and  international  consultants  to  be  contracted  through  a  single  firm,  who  work  with \ncounterpart staff across the respective MOHs. The IPM team will support the MOHs to develop a \nmonitoring and evaluation framework, including establishing a baseline for the project, midline, \nand  end-line  evaluation.  The  IPM  approach  allows  the  sharing  of  regional  experts  to  ensure \nalignment with ADB implementation processes and support regionalism. Each country will pay its \nproportion of IPM person-months used through separate contracts.31  \n\n19.  \nThe MOHs will recruit additional consultants under the project as needed to (i) undertake \na nationwide  survey  of  immunization coverage  in year  5 to  determine  whether the  project  has \nachieved its target outcome and outputs, including equity of coverage; and (ii) engage civil society \nfor  community  mobilization,  where  necessary.  The  project  will  use  the  existing  health  sector \ncoordination  mechanisms \nin  each  country\u2014involving  MOHs,  MOFs,  other  government \ndepartments  concerned,  development  partners,  and  civil  society\u2014to  oversee  project \nimplementation  and  report  to  the  MOFs  and  ADB.  Each  country  will  expand  the  existing  VII \ncountry agreements or enter into new agreements with UNICEF to support project investments. \n\n20. \nEach of the four countries will procure vaccines, cold chain equipment, and associated \nservices from UNICEF through direct contracting. Currently, each country has arrangements in \nplace  with  UNICEF.  Under  the  project,  the  countries  and  UNICEF  will  amend  their  existing \nagreements  and  enter  into  new  arrangements  where  required.  Procurement  of  vaccines,  cold \nchain equipment and associated services will be carried out in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply \n                                                \n30  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  All four countries have requested ADB support to recruit a single firm. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fManual and its Human Resources Manual.32 For goods and consulting services not procured or \nrecruited  through  UNICEF,  competitive  procurement  will  be  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n21. \nthe PAM (footnote 30). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan and grants closing date  31 May 2024 \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nDecember 2018\u2013November 2023 \n30 November 2023 \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n\n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nQCBS \n\nSamoa: Health Program Advisory Committee \nTonga: National Health Development Committee \nTuvalu: HIV/Tuberculosis Steering Committee \nVanuatu: Ministry of Health Executive Committee \nSamoa: Ministry of Finance \nTonga: Ministry of Finance and National Planning \nTuvalu: Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning \nVanuatu: Ministry of Finance and Economic Management \nThe Ministries of Health of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu \nIntegrated project management team to be shared by the MOHs of \nSamoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. 13 staff in total. \nSingle \nsource \n\n20 contracts \n\nShopping  3 contracts \n\n122 person-months (Samoa) \n102 person-months (Tonga) \n95 person-months (Tuvalu) \n142 person-months (Vanuatu) \n10 person-months (Tonga) \n6 person-months (Tuvalu) \n13 person-months (Vanuatu) \n20 person-months (Samoa) \n10 person-months (Tonga) \n12 person-months (Tuvalu) \n20 person-months (Vanuatu) \n\nICS \n\nDirect \ncontract \n\n$3.2 million (Samoa) \n$1.5 million (Tonga) \n$0.3 million (Tuvalu) \n$4.1 million (Vanuatu) \n$0.04 million (Tonga) \n$0.03 million (Tuvalu) \n$0.33 million (Vanuatu) \n$1.2 million (Samoa) \n$0.8 million (Tonga) \n$0.8 million (Tuvalu) \n$1.6 million (Vanuatu) \n$0.14 million (Tonga) \n$0.09 million (Tuvalu) \n$0.20 million (Vanuatu) \n$1.2 million (Samoa) \n$0.5 million (Tonga) \n$0.5 million (Tuvalu) \n$0.9 million (Vanuatu) \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = international consultant selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the governments and ADB. \n\nDisbursement \n\n \n\n                                                \n32  ADB. 2010. Strengthening the Partnership between the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund: Procurement Arrangements. Manila. Under this Board-approved paper, ADB agrees to the use of UNICEF\u2019s \nSupply Manual and UNICEF\u2019s Human Resources Manual for the procurement of associated goods, equipment, and \nservices (including consulting services); and the procurement of goods, equipment, and services in a nonmember \ncountry or the procurement of goods, equipment, and services produced in a nonmember country. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n22. \nThrough strategic investments in both the procurement of 654,000 doses of vaccines and \nin activities to strengthen national health systems, the expected outcome of broader immunization \ncoverage  and  greater  efficiency  of  primary  health  care  will  benefit  a  population  of  just  over \n583,700 people across Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Neighboring Pacific countries are \nlikely to benefit from increased regional immunization coverage, fewer transboundary infections, \nand more competitive vaccine prices through VII, which are all expected to contribute to regional \ncooperation and integration.33 \n \nA. \n \nThe  national  immunization  programs  and  policies,  cold  chain  network,  procurement \n23. \ncapacity,  information  systems,  and  fiscal  management  capacity  in  the  health  sector  were \nassessed  and  found  that  both  the  staff  and  logistics  capacity  of  each  MOH  were  sufficient  for \nexpanding  routine  immunization.  The  project  will  introduce  new  technologies  such  as  solar \nfridges, temperature-sensitive vaccine vials, and digital health tools for supply chain management, \nwhich will also improve immunization documentation and support decision-making by health staff. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic  analysis.  Most  project  resources  will  be  allocated  to  the  procurement  of \nvaccines and health infrastructure upgrades (cold chain, health facility assets, and staff training). \nThese investments are estimated to translate into better health outcomes by reducing the burden \nof disease, and into long-term cost savings and potential economic growth. The project has a pro-\npoor and equity focus by strengthening health services in remote areas. The economic benefits \naccrue from (i) savings for households from less out-of-pocket spending on health care and (ii) \nbenefits from disability-adjusted life years saved. Given the health-related nature of the project, \nwhich makes quantification of the monetary value of project benefits difficult, a cost-effectiveness \nanalysis was carried out. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (dollars per disability-adjusted \nlife  year  averted)  was calculated for  each  vaccine  in each  country.  All three vaccines  are  cost \neffective and, if introduced together, are highly cost effective for all four countries. \n \n25. \nFinancial sustainability. The governments need to allocate additional funds beyond the \nproject  life  to  sustain  the  newly  introduced  vaccines,  which  are  estimated  at  less  than  3%  of \ngovernment health expenditure. Project costs are expected to be incurred annually over the 5-\nyear project period and total about $29.66 million across the four countries. Although counterpart \nfunding requirements are higher in Tonga and Vanuatu, fiscal conditions in these countries are \nimproving. By contrast, fiscal positions in Samoa and Tuvalu could worsen but their counterpart \nfunding  needs  are  more  manageable.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  will  be  sought \nthrough  measures  such  as  factoring  in  forecast  needs  for  routine  vaccines  and  cold  chain \nreplenishment in national health budgets and phasing the financing of vaccine procurement. By \nexpanding preventive health care, the project will also contribute to reducing future health costs. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nProject-related governance risks were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement \nand  financial  management  requirements.34 A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  found  that \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n33  Regional Diagnostic Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nadequate  MOH  counterpart  staff  are  in  place  but  are  unfamiliar  with  preparing  and  managing \nADB-funded  procurement.  The  recruitment  of  the  IPM  team  with  in-country  and  regional \nprocurement  specialists will  mitigate this risk.  Complex  procurements  under  the  project  will  be \nundertaken  by  UNICEF,  which  has  extensive  experience  in  global  vaccine  procurement.  The \nfinancial management risk rating is moderate for Samoa and Tonga, substantial for Tuvalu, and \nhigh  for  Vanuatu,  but  remains  manageable  by  engaging  a  regional  finance  and  procurement \nspecialist  and  national  finance  and  procurement  officers  through  the  IPM  team;  conducting \nindependent  biannual  fiduciary  reviews,  providing  targeted  technical  assistance  to  develop \ncapacity in ADB procedures and financial monitoring, and establishing separate project accounts. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  gender  equity.  It  will  introduce  the  HPV  vaccine  in  the  four \n28. \ncountries  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  cervical  cancer.  Cervical  cancer  carries  significant \neconomic and social costs for the women affected, given their marginalized socioeconomic status \nand their triple burden of family, work, and community responsibilities. The project will contribute \nto reducing equity gaps in childhood immunization, especially in remote, rural, and outer-island \ncommunities.  A  reduction  in  mortality  from  vaccine-preventable  diseases  will  bring  significant \nhealth,  educational,  social,  and  economic  benefits.  A  gender  action  plan  was  agreed  with  the \nrespective  governments  to  support  the  overall  project  outcome  of  increasing  HPV  vaccine \ncoverage for girls aged 9\u201314 years, and PCV and rotavirus vaccine coverage for birth cohorts of \nboth sexes.35 Other targets include: (i) gender-responsive microplans, (ii) training of at least 50% \nof female health providers  on  introducing  and  managing  new  vaccines,  (iii)  gender-responsive \ncommunity mobilization strategies, (iv) activities to promote adolescent reproductive health with \ngender equity considerations and (v) nationwide sex-disaggregated immunization reporting. \n \nE. \n \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project was screened \n29. \nand  categorized  as  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  No \nphysical works will occur, and therefore no environmental impacts or land acquisition. The project \nwill finance the management of waste from cold chain equipment and biomedical supplies, and \nsupport training on waste management. The project will not cause any physical and economic \ndisplacement, will not affect any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined \nby  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  will  not  introduce  any  additional  risk  to  the \noccupational health and safety of health care workers. \n \nF. \n \n30. \nThe overall risk assessment is moderate for Samoa and Vanuatu, and low for Tonga and \nTuvalu. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 34). \n \n \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n35  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRatings \n\nRisks \nMOHs have \ncompeting public \nhealth priorities \nWeak financial \nmanagement and \nprocurement capacity \nHuman resource \ninstability \n\nHigh: All \n\nSubstantial: \nTuvalu High: \nVanuatu \nSubstantial: \nSamoa \n\nSpread of inaccurate \ninformation on \nvaccination \nGlobal shortage of \nvaccines \n\nSubstantial: \nAll \n\nSubstantial: \nAll \n\nRegular regional meetings with project directors will enable \nthe IPM team and ADB to continuously advocate and support \neach MOH to resolve system bottlenecks. \nThe IPM team will assist each MOH with financial reporting, \nprocurement, and budget planning.
