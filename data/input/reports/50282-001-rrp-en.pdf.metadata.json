THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Vanuatu; and (ii) proposed grants to the Independent State of Samoa, Kingdom \nof Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Republic of Vanuatu; all for the Systems Strengthening for Effective \nCoverage of New Vaccines in the Pacific Project. \n \n2.  The project adopts a regional approach to strengthening critical components of health \nsystems for improved immunization outcomes by using the introduction of three vaccines in four \nPacific island countries: Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Global evidence demonstrates that \nimmunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions, and a corner \nstone of good public health.1 The project will reduce the burden of disease of pneumonia and \ndiarrhea in children, minimize outbreaks related to vaccine-preventable diseases, decrease the \nincidence of cervical cancer, integrate immunization programs into broader health systems, and \nimprove equity in access to primary health services. It will promote country ownership in providing \neffective immunization services and access to affordable prices for quality-assured safe vaccines \nand cold chain products through pooled procurement and partnerships. The project will also \nenable the four countries to invest in strengthening frontline service delivery through evidence-\nbased planning and decision-making to enhance the sustainability of immunization programs and \npromote innovations through regional exchanges. The project is consistent with the Pacific \nApproach 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and aligns with ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan for Health 2015-2020.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Pacific context. The Pacific region is composed of numerous small island nations that \nare geographically isolated and face various human and resource constraints. Their diverse \neconomic growth led to a high level of regional and extra-regional migration, making them \nvulnerable to imported diseases and other regional health security (RHS) threats.3 Despite these \nchallenges, many Pacific countries made significant progress toward the Millennium Development \nGoal 4 of reducing child mortality (32% regional reduction since 1990).4 These achievements can \nbe attributed in part to well-established primary health care systems with high coverage of routine \nvaccination programs.5 Widening access to immunization programs is a shared responsibility \nacross  countries  and  ensuring  the  timely  supply  of  vaccines  form  part  of  public  health \npreparedness capacities necessary to meet the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and \nPublic Health Emergencies III recommendations.6 \n \n                                                \n1  World Health Organization (WHO). 2013.

Health service delivery and financing in the four countries. Health services are \npredominantly  provided  and  financed  by  the  governments;  their  share  of  current  health \nexpenditure ranges from 47% in Tonga to 96% in Tuvalu.7 The services are free, apart from small \nuser fees in Samoa and Vanuatu. Out-of-pocket spending on health is relatively low compared \nwith the region and globally. The capacity for diagnostic and specialist services (including cervical \ncancer screening and treatment) is limited, which results in overseas referrals at high cost to the \ngovernments, patients, and their families. Key development partners supporting the health sector \nin the four countries are the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF), and the governments of Australia and New Zealand.8 \n \n5.  Immunization program. Routine immunization coverage in Tonga and Tuvalu is relatively \nhigh, while coverage rates in Samoa and Vanuatu are below international targets (greater than \n90%).9 All  four  immunization  programs  are  procuring  vaccines  through  UNICEF\u2019s  vaccine \nindependence  initiative  (VII),  a  pooled  procurement  facility.  However,  the  programs  are \nincomplete because they lack three WHO-recommended routine vaccines: human papilloma virus \n(HPV) vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), and rotavirus vaccine.10 They are further \nweakened by outdated cold chain equipment to keep the vaccines at recommended temperatures, \nshortages in staff, and difficulties in reaching \u201cthe last mile\u201d to remote communities. \n \n6.  Country commitment. The governments of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are \ncommitted to improving child and adolescent health outcomes, as reflected in their various health \nstrategies: Samoa\u2019s fourth Health Sector Plan 2019\u20132029 (forthcoming); Tonga\u2019s National Health \nStrategic Plan 2015\u20132020; Tuvalu\u2019s Health Reform Strategy 2016\u20132019, and Vanuatu\u2019s Health \nSector Strategy 2017\u20132020.11 Common elements of the four strategies to progress toward \nuniversal  health  coverage  are  (i)  strengthening  equitable  access  and  efficiency  of  health \ninterventions, (ii) improving the capacity of health service delivery, and (iii) ensuring evidence-\nbased planning through better information systems. The 5-year project will support the four \ncountries in providing immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases to infants (0\u20132 years) \nand girls (9\u201314 years), resulting in covering more than 30% of the combined population. \n \n7.  Disease burden: cervical cancer. Pacific leaders have highlighted the need for HPV \nprograms to prevent cervical cancer,12 and the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum \nSecretariat has requested assistance from ADB to alleviate the cervical cancer burden in the \nPacific.13 About 70% of all cervical cancer cases are caused by the sexually transmitted HPV \n                                                \n7   Tonga has a high share of external health expenditure at nearly 40% of current health expenditure. World Bank \ndata. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.OOPC.TO.ZS (accessed 16 July 2018). \n8   ADB signed a memorandum of understanding with each of WHO (27 August 2018) and UNICEF (11 October 2018) \nidentifying cooperation in strengthening health security and health systems. \n9  Reported national coverage of the third dose of the diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013pertussis vaccine is 94% in Tuvalu, 96% in \nTonga, 80%\u201385% in Samoa, and 64%\u201381% in Vanuatu.

Disease burden: pneumonia and diarrhea. Globally, pneumonia and diarrhea are \namong the top three causes of mortality in children under 5 years of age, and about one-third of \nall  pneumonia  deaths  are  caused  by  the  pneumococcus  bacterium. 16 The  incidence  of \npneumococcal disease in Tonga was reported at 113 per 100,000 in children under the age of 2, \nwith a case fatality rate of 25%, significantly higher than the 8.7% reported in other global \nsettings.17 Diarrhea is estimated to cause 2% of under-5 child deaths worldwide, with a rotavirus \nmortality rate of 1.5 per 100,000 children.18 Under-5 mortality from diarrhea is comparatively \nhigher in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, ranging from 3% in Tuvalu to 16% in Vanuatu.19 \nHospital data from the four countries suggest that pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading cause \nfor the admission of children.20 Both conditions are preventable through rotavirus vaccine and \nPCV, along with other treatments such as antibiotics and oral rehydration solutions.21 \n \n9.  Project design features. The project supports a comprehensive vaccination program by \nfinancing the introduction of the HPV and rotavirus vaccines and PCV into four health systems. \nIncreasing the immunization coverage will reduce inequities and poverty and help the countries \nachieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 by providing timely access to life-saving vaccines. \nIntegrating vaccine programs into broader primary health care is an opportunity to strengthen \nhealth  sector  management  capacity  by  improving  evidence-based  planning  and  resource \nallocation, which will increase the sustainability of immunization and primary health care. The \nproject also addresses market failures through the positive externalities of herd immunity against \nthe targeted diseases. Although some tiered vaccine pricing exists, the cost of the HPV and \nrotavirus vaccines and PCV can be prohibitive for middle-income countries with small population \nsizes and thus weak individual purchasing power.22 As middle-income countries, they are unable \nto access global vaccine support through agencies such as Gavi.23 Pooled procurement through \nUNICEF\u2019s VII allows countries to benefit from lower prices, quality products, and technical \nexpertise in vaccines and cold chain management as well as emergency stockpiles. \n \n10.

The \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by reducing health inequalities, progressing gender \nequality, and supporting regional cooperation.25 The project will benefit from ADB\u2019s experience in \nRHS projects.26 It will also leverage ADB\u2019s extensive experience in Papua New Guinea in \nstrengthening rural health systems and, more recently, ADB support in Samoa, Tonga, and \nVanuatu for digital health information systems.27 \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) incidence and prevalence of cervical \ncancer in the Pacific region reduced (Healthy Islands Monitoring Framework) and (ii) healthy lives \nensured, and wellbeing for all ages promoted (Sustainable Development Goal 3).28 The project \nwill have the following outcome: increased immunization coverage of HPV vaccine, PCV and \nrotavirus vaccine meets the 90% vaccine coverage target set by the WHO Global Vaccine Action \nPlan (footnote 1). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output  1:  Regional  vaccine  procurement  strengthened.  This  output  will  support \nSamoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu to procure the HPV vaccine, PCV and the rotavirus vaccine \nthrough the VII. The project will implement a phased counterpart financing approach starting in \nyear 2 of the 5-year project, and the governments will ensure sustainability beyond the project. \nThe project will finance the countries\u2019 VII credit line in year 1 where required. In Tonga, the project \nwill  also  finance,  from  year  2,  the  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella  vaccine  through  phased \ncounterpart financing, replacing the current measles and rubella vaccine.29 The output will also \nsupport the procurement of cold chain equipment and associated supplies through VII, with \nperformance, quality, and safety certification by WHO and UNICEF. The output will support \nmicroplanning in at least 90% of health facilities, and national vaccine forecasting, which includes \nemergency preparedness planning and maintenance of a buffer stock. Procurement capacity \nbuilding will contribute to more effective planning and procurement of health commodities. \n \n13.  Output 2: Health systems strengthened. This output will use the introduction of vaccines \nto strengthen primary health care and reduce inequities in access to health services. It will support \n(i) the update of immunization and cold chain policies, guidelines, and training materials; (ii) \n                                                \n24  ADB. 2016.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The ministries of finance (MOFs) in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu will be the \nexecuting agencies, and the ministries of health (MOHs) the implementing agencies. The MOHs \nare responsible for the overall administration and financial management of the project and will be \nsupported by a regional integrated project management (IPM) team. The team will consist of \nnational and international consultants to be contracted through a single firm, who work with \ncounterpart staff across the respective MOHs. The IPM team will support the MOHs to develop a \nmonitoring and evaluation framework, including establishing a baseline for the project, midline, \nand end-line evaluation. The IPM approach allows the sharing of regional experts to ensure \nalignment with ADB implementation processes and support regionalism. Each country will pay its \nproportion of IPM person-months used through separate contracts.31  \n19.   The MOHs will recruit additional consultants under the project as needed to (i) undertake \na nationwide survey of immunization coverage in year 5 to determine whether the project has \nachieved its target outcome and outputs, including equity of coverage; and (ii) engage civil society \nfor community mobilization, where necessary. The project will use the existing health sector \ncoordination  mechanisms  in  each  country\u2014involving  MOHs,  MOFs,  other  government \ndepartments  concerned,  development  partners,  and  civil  society\u2014to  oversee  project \nimplementation and report to the MOFs and ADB. Each country will expand the existing VII \ncountry agreements or enter into new agreements with UNICEF to support project investments. \n20.  Each of the four countries will procure vaccines, cold chain equipment, and associated \nservices from UNICEF through direct contracting. Currently, each country has arrangements in \nplace with UNICEF. Under the project, the countries and UNICEF will amend their existing \nagreements and enter into new arrangements where required. Procurement of vaccines, cold \nchain equipment and associated services will be carried out in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply \n                                                \n30  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  All four countries have requested ADB support to recruit a single firm. \n \n ", "7 \nManual and its Human Resources Manual.32 For goods and consulting services not procured or \nrecruited through UNICEF, competitive procurement will be used in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n21.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n22.  Through strategic investments in both the procurement of 654,000 doses of vaccines and \nin activities to strengthen national health systems, the expected outcome of broader immunization \ncoverage and greater efficiency of primary health care will benefit a population of just over \n583,700 people across Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Neighboring Pacific countries are \nlikely to benefit from increased regional immunization coverage, fewer transboundary infections, \nand more competitive vaccine prices through VII, which are all expected to contribute to regional \ncooperation and integration.33 \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The  national  immunization  programs  and  policies,  cold  chain  network,  procurement \ncapacity,  information  systems,  and  fiscal  management  capacity  in  the  health  sector  were \nassessed and found that both the staff and logistics capacity of each MOH were sufficient for \nexpanding routine immunization. The project will introduce new technologies such as solar \nfridges, temperature-sensitive vaccine vials, and digital health tools for supply chain management, \nwhich will also improve immunization documentation and support decision-making by health staff. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analysis. Most project resources will be allocated to the procurement of \nvaccines and health infrastructure upgrades (cold chain, health facility assets, and staff training). \nThese investments are estimated to translate into better health outcomes by reducing the burden \nof disease, and into long-term cost savings and potential economic growth. The project has a pro-\npoor and equity focus by strengthening health services in remote areas. The economic benefits \naccrue from (i) savings for households from less out-of-pocket spending on health care and (ii) \nbenefits from disability-adjusted life years saved. Given the health-related nature of the project, \nwhich makes quantification of the monetary value of project benefits difficult, a cost-effectiveness \nanalysis was carried out. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (dollars per disability-adjusted \nlife year averted) was calculated for each vaccine in each country. All three vaccines are cost \neffective and, if introduced together, are highly cost effective for all four countries. \n \n25.  Financial sustainability. The governments need to allocate additional funds beyond the \nproject life to sustain the newly introduced vaccines, which are estimated at less than 3% of \ngovernment health expenditure. Project costs are expected to be incurred annually over the 5-\nyear project period and total about $29.66 million across the four countries. Although counterpart \nfunding requirements are higher in Tonga and Vanuatu, fiscal conditions in these countries are \nimproving. By contrast, fiscal positions in Samoa and Tuvalu could worsen but their counterpart \nfunding needs are more manageable. The financial sustainability of the project will be sought \nthrough measures such as factoring in forecast needs for routine vaccines and cold chain \nreplenishment in national health budgets and phasing the financing of vaccine procurement. By \nexpanding preventive health care, the project will also contribute to reducing future health costs. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Project-related governance risks were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement \nand financial management requirements.34 A project procurement risk assessment found that \n                                                \n33  Regional Diagnostic Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nadequate MOH counterpart staff are in place but are unfamiliar with preparing and managing \nADB-funded  procurement.  The  recruitment  of  the  IPM  team  with  in-country  and  regional \nprocurement specialists will mitigate this risk. Complex procurements under the project will be \nundertaken by UNICEF, which has extensive experience in global vaccine procurement. The \nfinancial management risk rating is moderate for Samoa and Tonga, substantial for Tuvalu, and \nhigh for Vanuatu, but remains manageable by engaging a regional finance and procurement \nspecialist and national finance and procurement officers through the IPM team; conducting \nindependent  biannual  fiduciary  reviews,  providing  targeted  technical  assistance  to  develop \ncapacity in ADB procedures and financial monitoring, and establishing separate project accounts. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The project is classified gender equity. It will introduce the HPV vaccine in the four \ncountries  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  cervical  cancer.  Cervical  cancer  carries  significant \neconomic and social costs for the women affected, given their marginalized socioeconomic status \nand their triple burden of family, work, and community responsibilities. The project will contribute \nto reducing equity gaps in childhood immunization, especially in remote, rural, and outer-island \ncommunities. A reduction in mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases will bring significant \nhealth, educational, social, and economic benefits. A gender action plan was agreed with the \nrespective governments  to  support the  overall  project  outcome  of  increasing  HPV  vaccine \ncoverage for girls aged 9\u201314 years, and PCV and rotavirus vaccine coverage for birth cohorts of \nboth sexes.35 Other targets include: (i) gender-responsive microplans, (ii) training of at least 50% \nof female health providers on introducing and managing new vaccines, (iii) gender-responsive \ncommunity mobilization strategies, (iv) activities to promote adolescent reproductive health with \ngender equity considerations and (v) nationwide sex-disaggregated immunization reporting. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project was screened \nand categorized as C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. No \nphysical works will occur, and therefore no environmental impacts or land acquisition. The project \nwill finance the management of waste from cold chain equipment and biomedical supplies, and \nsupport training on waste management. The project will not cause any physical and economic \ndisplacement, will not affect any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined \nby  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  will  not  introduce  any  additional  risk  to  the \noccupational health and safety of health care workers. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n30.  The overall risk assessment is moderate for Samoa and Vanuatu, and low for Tonga and \nTuvalu. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 34). \n \n \n \n                                                \n35  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Ratings  Mitigation Measures \nMOHs have  High: All  Regular regional meetings with project directors will enable \ncompeting public  the IPM team and ADB to continuously advocate and support \nhealth priorities  each MOH to resolve system bottlenecks. \nWeak financial  Substantial:  The IPM team will assist each MOH with financial reporting, \nmanagement and  Tuvalu High:  procurement, and budget planning.

ASSURANCES \n \n31.  The  governments  of  Samoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and grant and loan documents. The governments \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant and \nloan agreements. The amendments and/or the signing of the agreements with UNICEF will be a \ncondition to disbursement of grant and loan proceeds for vaccines, medical equipment, VII credit \nline, and UNICEF services. \n \nV.
