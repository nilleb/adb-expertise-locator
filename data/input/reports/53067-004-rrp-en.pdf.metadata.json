THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Housing for Urban Poor Sector Project in Tamil \nNadu. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Capacity for \nAffordable Housing Delivery, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will promote access to inclusive, resilient, and sustainable housing and urban \ndevelopment in Tamil Nadu by supporting the state in (i) relocating vulnerable communities living \nin areas exposed to natural hazards to newly constructed housing units in safe locations, which \nwill be implemented using a sector loan approach; (ii) mobilizing private sector financing to \nconstruct  affordable  housing  units  for  poor  urban  households,  migrant  workers  from  the \neconomically weaker section (EWS), lower-income group (LIG), and other populations that are \nunderserved by the housing market, which will be implemented following an approach similar to \na financial intermediation loan; and (iii) supporting the state in regional development planning.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urban sector challenges. Tamil Nadu is the sixth most populous state in India with a \npopulation of more than 72 million. The state contributes 8.54% of India\u2019s gross domestic product, \nwith strong economic growth accompanied by increased rural\u2013urban migration.2 Tamil Nadu has \none of the highest rates of urbanization in India, with 48% of the population living in urban areas. \nSharp increases in urban populations and rapid urbanization have not been well-managed, and \nthe supply of urban infrastructure and services does not meet the high and increasing demand. \n \n4.  Housing shortage in urban Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu is among India\u2019s large states with \nan acute housing shortage. Issues affecting the demand for housing include (i) the poor lacks \naccess  to  existing  housing  programs  because  these  are  unaffordable,  and  have  stringent \nqualification requirements; (ii) designs are not culturally and gender-sensitive; and (iii) housing \nprojects experience low demand and occupancy because they are located far from city centers. \nFactors affecting the housing supply include (i) inadequate public resources for urban housing, \n(ii) difficulty in attracting private investment because of low investment returns and lack of \nincentives,  (iii)  mismatch  between  housing  policies  and  procedures  of  central  and  state \ngovernment and capacity of the poor, and (iv) weaknesses in regional planning resulting in areas \nthat are strong economically but lacking a supply of affordable housing. The state\u2019s housing deficit \naccounts for 6.66% of the national housing shortfall.3 National data shows that, when the housing \nshortage is mapped against income levels, EWS households account for 56% of the total shortage, \nand LIG households for 39%. Only 4% of the national housing shortage is borne by households \nin the middle-income group or those with higher income, as current housing stocks cater to \nmiddle- and higher-income groups. \n \n1  The Government of India defines EWS as those households with annual household income of \u20b9300,000 ($4,050), \nand LIG as households with an annual household income of \u20b9600,000 ($8,100); Government of India, Ministry of \nHousing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA). 2016. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \u2013 Housing for All (Urban) \nScheme Guidelines (PMAY-HFA). Delhi. \n2  Reserve Bank of India. 2020. Handbook of Statistics on Indian States. Mumbai (Table 17.

Delhi. The figure is based on 2011 \ncensus data. New census scheduled in 2021 but was postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak. \n \n ", "2 \n \n5.  In Tamil Nadu, the large shortage of housing for EWS and LIG households results in \nlimited housing options for the urban poor. Where housing is available, it fails to meet the needs \nof the urban poor including access to jobs and urban services. Unplanned urbanization and \nhousing deficits have contributed to informal settlements and intensification of slums. Tamil Nadu \nis among five states that host 62% of the India\u2019s slum population. The state has 5.8 million slum \nresidents, accounting for 17% of the urban population, and 8.9% of India\u2019s total slum population.4 \nThe incomes of most slum residents place them in the EWS and LIG. Informal settlements and \nslums are often situated in hazard-exposed areas, are congested, and lack appropriate services \n(i.e., electricity, piped water supply, and sanitation or waste facilities). Slum areas are exposed to \nnatural hazards with impacts that are exacerbated by climate change, environmental degradation, \nand health risks. \n \n6.  Providing housing for the urban poor is critical to ensure that growth in cities is sustainable \nand not accompanied by increased inequity. Many housing units built to relocate slum households \nwere  not  planned  with  beneficiary  input;  in  addition  to  being  located  far  from  economic \nopportunities and infrastructure, they also suffer from inadequate operation and maintenance \n(O&M). The result is that limited resources are wasted on units that are unoccupied. These failures \nresult from a combination of designs that did not adequately consider the environmental, social, \nand economic context, and inadequate urban and regional planning, which is central to sustained \ngrowth and equitable cities. \n \n7.  Government  housing  strategy.  Housing  programs  have  long  been  a  fundamental \ncomponent of central government development plans and priorities, but their impact has been \ndiluted by shifting perspectives, divergent approaches, and lack of clear policies.5 In 2007, the \nNational Urban Housing and Habitat Policy6 was created to set a clear direction for the housing \nsector. The policy acknowledged the nexus between urbanization, poverty, and slums, and is \ncentered on integrating the needs of disadvantaged EWS and LIG communities who struggle to \nafford  proper  shelter.  In  line  with  the  National  Urban  Housing  and  Habitat  Policy,  several \ncomprehensive urban initiatives have been undertaken. The most recent initiative is the Pradhan \nMantri Awas Yojana-Housing for All (PMAY-HFA). 7 This mission targets rural areas through \nPMAY (Gramin), and urban areas through PMAY (Urban). It aims to provide every family with \npermanent shelter that comes with electricity, water supply, and sanitation facilities by 2022. It is \npartially funded by the central government and implemented through state-level nodal agencies. \n \n8.  In Tamil Nadu, TNSCB is the entity responsible for implementing PMAY (Urban). In its \ndemand survey presented at the 51st Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee meeting, \nTNSCB estimated the total demand for affordable housing at 1.4 million units. However, only 0.76 \nmillion  (54.76%)  have  been  approved  to  date.  Addressing  this  gap  should  prioritize  slum \ncommunities at risk of hazards that require relocation. Affordable housing also needs to be made \naccessible to low-income migrant workers, working women, and low-income households headed \nby women to ensure sustainable urban development. The state government is constrained to \n \n4  Government of India, MHUPA, National Buildings Organisation. 2015. Slums in India: A Statistical Compendium \n2015. Delhi.

Alignment with government and ADB priorities and strategies. The project aligns with \npillar 2 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, \nwhich promotes inclusive access to infrastructure networks and services; it is also included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India, 2021\u20132023.8 It is aligned with the Government \nof India\u2019s development priorities and policies on urban sector development, ADB Strategy 2030,9 \nand the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that focus on making cities more \ninclusive,  resilient,  and  livable. 10  It  directly  supports  the  current  comprehensive  urban \ndevelopment mission, PMAY-HFA. \n \n10.  Lessons. The project builds on lessons from previous urban development projects and \nhousing finance programs of ADB and the Government of India. In designing affordable housing, \nthere  is  a  need  to  (i)  balance  socioeconomic  priorities,  (ii)  integrate  regional  and  spatial \nperspectives in development and economic planning, (iii) craft and implement appropriate policies \nand strategies, and (iv) ensure inclusivity.11 \n \n11.  Project design. The Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) has plans to meet the housing \nsector\u2019s needs and institutional capacity to implement such plans. For output 1, which will \nconstruct affordable and improved housing for vulnerable communities, GOTN has identified nine \nseparate affordable housing subprojects in different locations throughout the state. However, \nbecause of differences in risk profiles, variations in relocation sites vis-\u00e0-vis original household \nlocations, unique design requirements based on beneficiary needs and site conditions, and other \nfactors, the preparation status of these subprojects differ. Therefore, the sector lending approach \nis considered suitable as it will enable GOTN to carry out affordable housing projects under output \n1 based on their readiness.12 The approach will also allow successive subprojects to adopt \nsuccessful changes from previous subprojects as well as introduce incremental changes and \nredesign less-successful elements. \n \n12.  For output 2, which will increase affordable housing for the urban poor and migrant \nworkers, ADB will follow an approach similar to a financial intermediation loan. ADB loan proceeds \nfor output 2 will be invested as GOTN\u2019s equity into the Tamil Nadu Shelter Fund (TNSF), an \nalternative investment fund established by GOTN to make investments in affordable housing \n \n8  ADB. 2017.

The combined proceeds of the GOTN and private sector \nfinancing will be channeled by TNSF, as the financial intermediary, to support multiple affordable \nhousing subprojects currently under development, including those to be carried out under public\u2013\nprivate partnership deal structures. \n \n13.   Coronavirus disease. The rationale for the project is stronger in view of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is more difficult to address in slum areas, given the \ndeficiencies in water, sanitation, drainage, and waste collection, and the space constraints that \nmake social distancing and self-quarantine almost impossible. A Mumbai case study has shown \nthat slums are being disproportionally impacted by  COVID-19 pandemic.14 Slum conditions \nexacerbate existing health issues in slum populations, and efforts to contain the pandemic \nprevents slum dwellers from earning income. Providing affordable housing and urban services to \nthe urban poor and migrant workers will increase their resilience to pandemics. The graduation \nprogram to be implemented in project housing sites will increase the resilience of beneficiaries\u2019 \nlivelihoods, and promote behavioral change to maximize benefits from sanitation and other urban \nservices.15 The project will build in required health and safety procedures in project design, \nparticularly because it involves extensive consultation and engagement with beneficiaries. The \nproject is aligned with the recently announced special economic and comprehensive package, \nwhich includes support for housing for migrant workers and the urban poor affected by the \npandemic.16 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: permanent shelter with appropriate \nhousing infrastructures and services provided for every affected household (footnote 7). The \nproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  access  to  inclusive,  safe,  and  affordable  housing \ninfrastructure  and  services  for  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  communities  in  Tamil  Nadu \nincreased.17 \n \n15.  Output  1:  Affordable  and  improved  housing  for  vulnerable  communities \nconstructed. The output will construct housing units in nine separate locations throughout the \nstate, and relocate an estimated 6,000 slum households vulnerable to natural hazards to safer \nlocations. Subprojects under this output will be prepared based on location, and the selection \ncriteria  will  include  technical,  economic,  financial,  safeguards,  and  sustainability  criteria  as \n \n13 TNSF is registered with the Securities Exchange Board of India as a social venture fund; consequently, it has a \nsocially responsible investment mandate to increase the supply of affordable housing through planned financial \napproaches, including the promotion of public\u2013private partnership deal structures. TNSF is managed by the GOTN-\npromoted TNIFMC. In 2017, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department provided TA to the TNIFMC (the fund \nmanager of the Tamil Nadu Shelter Fund) for its Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Fund.; ADB.

The output will include protection of cleared waterways \nto prevent re-encroachment, and restoration of ecological functions in two pilot sites. \n \n16.  Output 2: Affordable housing for urban poor and migrant workers increased. ADB \nfinancing for this output will be deployed as GOTN\u2019s equity into the TNSF, which in turn will be \nleveraged to catalyze private sector investment in TNSF.19 Utilizing such financing, TNSF will \nprovide  risk  capital,  such  as  in  the  form  of  equity  investment  or  participating  instruments \ninvestment, to specific special purpose vehicles or other entities undertaking affordable housing \nsubprojects that benefit populations underserved by the housing market. Examples of such \nsubprojects include industrial housing and working women\u2019s hostels (WWHs) for low-income and \nmigrant workers, resulting in an anticipated additional 500 beds for working women and 5,000 \nbeds for industrial workers. To be eligible for financing, subprojects must be financially and \neconomically  viable  affordable  housing  projects  that  increase  the  supply  of  housing  for \nhouseholds within EWS and LIG segments and other segments of the population that are \ncurrently underserved by the housing market. Additional eligibility criteria cover safeguards, \ngender,  and  sustainability,  as  detailed  in  the  PAM  (footnote  18).  Output  2  will  also  be \ncomplemented by capacity development of TNIFMC and the private sector. \n \n17.  Output 3: Regional plan development supported. The project will support DTCP in \nregional planning that integrates existing and proposed development plans.20 It will develop one \nmodel integrated regional plan from which subsequent plans will be developed to cover the state\u2019s \n30 districts. It will include provisions for economic development and affordable housing to balance \ngrowth  throughout  Tamil  Nadu  with  regard  to  infrastructure  development,  environmental \nprotection, disaster risk management, and gender.21 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n18.  The project incorporates improvements in the current process of affordable housing \ndelivery as a result of ADB\u2019s dialogue with implementing agencies and other stakeholders. It will \nimprove TNSCB\u2019s delivery process through design changes that address O&M and beneficiary \nneeds,  ensuring  social  protection,  livelihood  promotion,  financial  inclusion,  and  social \nempowerment. The project will also improve TNSCB\u2019s financial sustainability by introducing \nmaintenance planning and asset management, piloting long-term maintenance contracts and \n \n18  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 GOTN\u2019s equity investment in TNSF will take the form of a first loss capital instrument (class B shares). GOTN plans \nto mobilize a total of $300 million private sector funding to TNSF by leveraging the issuance of $92 million class B \nshares, out of which ADB will finance $35 million and the World Bank will finance $35 million, both through GOTN. \nThe balance of $22 million will be borne by GOTN.  \n20 Through the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1978, agencies\u2014including DTCP and Chennai \nMetropolitan Development Authority\u2014regulate urban land development. Although master plans and new town \ndevelopment plans were prepared for most of the urban centers in Tamil Nadu, integrated regional plans for the eight \nregions in Tamil Nadu have not been prepared by DTCP. \n21 Land use regulation plays an important part in determining the pattern of service, land, and housing occupation in \nurban areas. Ensuring that housing is provided where it is needed, rather than supporting segregation (for example \nat the periphery of cities) is a critical aspect of policy, which should provide housing diversity in terms of scale, \ntypology, and price. \n \n ", "6 \nschemes, and involving beneficiaries in O&M. Because affordable housing demand cannot be \nsolely supplied by TNSCB, ADB\u2019s financial support to TNSF will catalyze private sector financing \nfor affordable housing projects by bringing estate management expertise at the subproject level. \nFrom a regional development perspective, ADB\u2019s assistance will result in the preparation of \nfunctional  regional  plans;  these  will  support  regional  economic  development  with  resource \nmobilization, and through a development framework, make provisions for affordable housing \ntaking into account regional disparities, infrastructure development, environmental protection, and \ndisaster risk management.22 Two World Bank loans were approved in May 2020: a development \npolicy loan to strengthen the housing sector, and investment project financing to enable private \nsector participation in affordable housing (footnote 12). To maximize complementarity with the \nWorld Bank loans, the project will expand investments in housing, with a focus on addressing \nvulnerability and promoting resilience. \n \n19.  Replication  strategy.  The  GOTN  has  indicated  its  intention  to  approach  ADB  for \nadditional financing to further expand affordable housing, based on satisfactory performance and \nlessons from project implementation. Successful approaches for improved affordable housing \ndelivery will be replicated in other cities in Tamil Nadu where TNSCB will provide affordable \nhousing, and further equity can be provided to TNSF to increase the supply of affordable housing \nprojects.  The  attached  TA  will  document  O&M  and  asset  management  approaches,  and  \nmethodologies for improved affordable housing delivery such as the graduation program for \nvulnerable relocated beneficiaries. These, including improved regional planning, will be widely \ndisseminated  within Tamil Nadu and to other states in India (through the Capacity Development \nResource Center of the India Resident Mission). There is also potential to replicate this model to  \nother countries. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $215 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the PAM (footnote 18). The contingency will \ncover  possible  cost  increases  because  of  COVID-19  pandemic.  For  output  2,  ADB  loan \nassistance would be invested as GOTN\u2019s equity contribution in TNSF. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \nItem   Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.

Hence, contingencies and financing \ncharges are not included in the cost estimate. Under output 2, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) contribution of \n$35 million is intended to mobilize additional investment of $300 million to the Tamil Nadu Shelter Fund for a total \nfund size of $392 million, which is expected to leverage additional financing to support affordable housing projects. \n \n22 With respect to affordable housing for migrant workers and working women in the Madurai and Thoothukudi district \nnodes, the regional plans will be informed by ADB\u2019s ongoing master planning study (ADB.

The government has requested a regular loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. Based on the custom-tailored \nrepayment method, the average maturity is 12.96 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. \n \n22.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \n(i) civil works, (ii) consulting services, (iii) O&M, and (iv) incremental recurrent costs. The GOTN \nwill provide $65 million to the investment costs of the project to finance (i) taxes and duties;  \n(ii) financing charges during implementation; (iii) part of the civil works; (iv) O&M; (v) incremental \nrecurrent costs; (vi) resettlement costs; and (vii) contingencies; and will provide the loan and \ncounterpart funds to the project as a grant for outputs 1 and 3, and as equity for output 2. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  150.0  69.8 \nGovernment  65.0  30.2 \nTotal  215.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Banks estimates. \n \n23.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  The TA attached to the project will build capacity in the three implementing agencies to \ndeliver  affordable  housing  and  undertake  regional  planning. 24  The  TA  aims  to  support \nsustainability  by  assisting  in  the  development  of  O&M  contracts  and  modalities,  an  asset \nmanagement system, and pipeline development for TNSF; and building regional planning and \nfinancial management capacity. In addition, specific support will be provided (i) to build capacity \nin survey and data management, (ii) for graduation program implementation, and (iii) to plan for \ndifferent models for restoration of cleared waterways, which are key value additions in the delivery \nof affordable housing. Documentation of methodologies and processes will be important in the \nplanned replication of affordable housing in Tamil Nadu and in other states. \n \n26.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.65 million, of which $1.50 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA will provide \nadvisory services of loan-funded outputs, and the government will also provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. GOTN, through the \nHousing and Urban Development Department, will be the executing agency and TNSCB, TNIFMC, \nand DTCP will be the implementing agencies for the TA, which will be implemented over 4 years. \nThe TA will be administered by ADB. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Appraisal of subprojects. Output 1 has nine proposed subprojects. ADB supported the \nconcept design for five subprojects of which the detailed designs of three were reviewed. Of these, \ntwo affordable housing subprojects in Kalanivasal and Reddiarpatti were fully appraised by ADB \n \n24 Attached TA Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nand found to meet all the agreed criteria. For output 2, TNIFMC will propose subprojects for ADB \nfinancing following the subproject eligibility criteria. 25 The executing agencies for outputs 1 and 2 \nare primarily responsible for finalizing appraisal reports and sharing these with ADB for review. \nADB will review the appraisal reports for all subprojects. ADB clearance of all safeguards \ndocuments is required. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  For output 1, technical due diligence included a comprehensive review of how TNSCB\u2019s \ndetailed engineering designs were developed from the concept design, cost estimates, and site \ninvestigations. The housing unit design and site layout adopt improvements to the current housing \nunits constructed by TNSCB. The design minimized the carbon footprint by prioritizing pedestrian \nnetworks over vehicular circulation in layout design; ensuring appropriate orientation of buildings \nto maximize natural ventilation, sunlight, and enhanced privacy; promoting landscapes that \nprioritize native vegetation and green spaces; improving visual quality and amenity through \nconvenient access of onsite social infrastructure, such as ration shops and community hall \nlivelihood  centers;  promoting  diversity  through  design  elevations  and  creation  of  nodes; \nincorporating safety by adopting the principles of crime prevention through environmental design; \nand enhancing the functionality of housing design for occupants, including by incorporating \nstorage lofts and maximizing living areas within space constraints. For output 2, TNIFMC will carry \nout technical due diligence with individual project sponsors of affordable housing subprojects and \nconfirm  their  validity  through  its  internal  appraisal  process.  The  climate  change  risk  and \nvulnerability assessment analyzed current and future climate impacts on the project, which were \nthe basis for planning appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures.26  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project aims to provide inclusive, resilient, and sustainable housing in Tamil Nadu by \nsupporting relocation of vulnerable communities living in areas exposed to natural hazards to safe \nshelter; providing affordable, proper housing for migrant workers from the EWS and LIG; and \nsupporting the state in regional development planning. The project is a sector project with output \n2 structured to follow an approach similar to a financial intermediation loan (para. 12). The \nestimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  the  sample  subprojects  are  8.4%\u201311.7%,27  \nexceeding  the  minimum  required  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  6%28 indicating \nsignificant economic returns. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the results are satisfactory \nexcept for the combined worst-case scenarios for all sample subprojects. At completion, the \nsample subprojects will address (i) affordable and improved housing for vulnerable communities \nin Reddiarpatti and Kalanivasal from 2025; and (ii) affordable housing for urban poor and migrant \nworkers in Vallam industrial housing and four WWHs from 2023. The estimated poverty impact \n \n25 The subproject selection and eligibility criteria are in the PAM (footnote 18). For the economic analysis, four sample \nsubprojects (Kalanivasal, Reddiarpatti, industrial housing at Vallam, and WWHs at four locations) were appraised. \nThe appraisal methodology will be followed by the executing agency for the selection of the remaining subprojects \nunder the program; these will need to have an economic internal rate of return of at least 6%. Safeguards due \ndiligence considered three sample subprojects (Kalanivasal, Reddiarpatti, and Vallam). \n26 Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. For social sector projects, the minimum \nrequired economic opportunity cost of capital is 6%. \n \n ", "10 \nratio of the sample subprojects is 23.0%\u201355.8%. Given Tamil Nadu\u2019s overall urban poverty \nheadcount ratio (20.3%), the project is expected to benefit the poor considerably.29 \n \n30.  Financial  analysis.  For  output  1,  financial  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  sample \nsubprojects for which detailed engineering designs and cost estimates are available. Maintenance \ncharges from households and rental income from allied commercial activities are the main \nsources of income for the subprojects. The income generated from the subprojects covers only \nabout 15%\u201333% of the O&M expenses. A review of TNSCB\u2019s financial performance shows that \nTNSCB has been generating an operating surplus in the past 5 years. However, when the impact \nof the subprojects is taken into account, TNSCB is likely to have an operating deficit. To address \nthese challenges, measures to address sustainability (para. 32) have been agreed. Over the \nmedium- to long-term, TNSCB will (i) regularly revise maintenance charges until full O&M \nrecovery, (ii) shift responsibility for municipal charges from TNSCB to the households,30 and (iii) \nimprove collection efficiency to 90% during the early years of the operation period. Overall, the \nfinancial sustainability risk is categorized substantial.  \n \n31.  For output 2, financial due diligence in accordance with financial intermediation loans was \nconducted. TNIFMC has a well-defined institutional governance structure and investment process \nbased on the Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019s Alternative Investment Funds regulations \nfor  alternative  investment  funds,  which  are  considered  to  ensure  sound  risk  management \npractices. Both TNSF and TNIFMC are new and lack an investment track record; measuring \nperformance based on assessment of a financial intermediary is thus not possible.31 However, \nTNSF is in the advanced stages of getting investment committee approval for two subprojects. \nThe  subprojects  include  WWHs  and  industrial  housing.  Financial  analyses  of  these  two \nsubprojects were conducted as samples. Financial internal rates of return for these subprojects \nare 13.0% for the WWH and 12.9% for industrial housing and exceed the TNSF hurdle rate of 6% \nand target rate of 12%. Key risks identified in the analysis are (i) exit risk: TNSF is planning to \ninvest in WWH and industrial housing via non-convertible debenture with tenor of 25 years, while \nthe fund life is 10 years (which can be extended by 2 more years); and (ii) lack of track record: \nTNSF is a new fund established in 2018 and the fund manager, TNIFMC, also lacks a long track \nrecord (it was established in 2015 and is currently managing another fund, the Tamil Nadu \nInfrastructure Fund). \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n32.  Ensuring  appropriate  O&M  for  the  affordable  housing  units  that  are  constructed  is \nessential. GOTN and ADB agreed that (i) O&M is required beyond project completion to ensure \nlong-term sustainability of subproject facilities; (ii) ADB and the project will finance O&M during \nthe loan implementation period (until 2028); (iii) TNSCB, which will remain the asset owner, is \nparty to the O&M contracts with O&M service providers in the first 5 years and arranges O&M for \nthe succeeding 5-year period, and adequate funds towards O&M are provided to TNSCB after \n \n29 The poverty data is based on state-level figures, which constitute the most recent reliable poverty data (Government \nof India, Planning Commission. Report of the Expert Group to Review the Methodology for Measurement of Poverty. \nJune 2014). The poverty level among beneficiaries is from a primary survey of beneficiary households conducted in \n2020, presented in the Poverty and Social Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 In addition to the O&M expenses incurred for maintaining common facilities, TNSCB is also making payment to the \nurban local bodies and utilities towards the municipal charges, such as property tax, solid waste management \ncharges, and water and sewer charges. \n31 Financial performance of a financial intermediary will be assessed based on capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings \nquality, and liquidity. These parameters are assessed based on historical data of the financial intermediary. \n \n ", "11 \nthe project completion;32 (iv) loan covenants will cover (i) and (iii); and (v) for medium- to long-\nterm sustainability and to improve financials, TNSCB will increase maintenance charges, shift \nmunicipal charges to residents, and improve collection efficiency early. \n \n33.  GOTN and ADB will agree on O&M arrangements for the second 5-year period (years 6\u2013\n10) after the first 3 years O&M implementation.33 The O&M model will be informed by data on \ncollection of maintenance charges and other key financial information. It will also be informed by \nstudies undertaken through the TA on O&M modalities. As the asset owner, TNSCB needs to \nplay a key role (including, at a minimum, supervision and monitoring) in O&M, ensuring that there \nis sufficient financing for O&M to achieve sustainability. To mitigate the sustainability risk after the \nfirst 5-year O&M period, TNSCB will, by the end of the third year of implementation, develop a \ntime-bound action plan to ensure an efficient handover of the O&M responsibilities. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n34.  A financial management assessment has been conducted for the respective implementing \nagencies,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. 34  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement  risk  is  substantial  mainly  because  of  (i)  the  complex  financial  management \narrangements involving three implementing agencies; (ii) some accounts staff positions in TNSCB \nare vacant; (iii) the implementing agencies lack experience in ADB\u2019s financial management \nrequirements and disbursement procedures; (iv) TNSF and TNIFMC have been only recently \nestablished, and have a limited financial track record; and (v) TNSCB and DTCP have no internal \naudit function in place and use manual accounting systems. These risks will be mitigated by (i) \nsetting up a nodal project management unit (PMU) in TNSCB to coordinate and consolidate the \nfinancial information, (ii) filling the vacant accounts officer positions, (iii) providing ongoing training \nin  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  and  disbursement  procedures,  (iv)  including \ncomprehensive financial information in the quarterly project progress reports submitted to ADB, \nand (v) adopting the use of accounting software to record project transactions in TNSCB. \nMoreover, the project financial statements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to \nADB, following auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The achievement of value for money will \nbe based on noncomplex works packages that do not require innovative technical solutions. The \nconstruction contract modality with conformance-based specification will provide a high degree of \ncost certainty by adopting least-cost evaluation criteria. The O&M contracts are proposed to be \nprocured separately to target specialized O&M companies operating in this market segment. \n \n35.  Integrity due diligence was conducted for TNIFMC. No significant integrity risks were \nidentified.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n \n32 TNSCB will collect from beneficiaries upon their relocation to the housing sites, and funds collected while ADB and \nthe project finance O&M can be used to finance subsequent O&M by placing these in a fund (e.g., a sinking fund) to \nbe used for O&M after the initial 5-year period. To strengthen reporting and monitoring of the collection of \nmaintenance charges from allottees and/or residents, TNSCB will ensure that (i) its financial statements include a \ndetailed breakdown of the maintenance charges billed and collected during the fiscal year as a notes disclosure, (ii) \nfinancial statement audits are completed within the timelines prescribed in the statutory requirements, and (iii) the \naudited financial statements are submitted to ADB within 1 month after the approval by the relevant authority. \n33 ADB recommends retendering the contract to continue implementation of the O&M arrangements that apply during \nthe initial 5 years. However, on the basis of financial information and TA outcomes, ADB and the government can \nagree, in year 3, to a system of piloting alternative O&M arrangements in year 6. This can include O&M management \nthrough housing societies, provided (i) ownership of the units has been transferred to beneficiaries before the \nalternative O&M system is piloted, (ii) TNSCB and the O&M contractor have undertaken sufficient capacity building \nof the housing society, and (iii) TNSCB and/or GOTN commits to ensure sustainability for O&M payments. \n34 ADB. 2015. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n \n ", "12 \ndiscussed  with  GOTN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n36.  The proportion of poor among targeted beneficiaries is 31.1% in 2020, compared to the \noverall urban poverty headcount ratio of 20.3% for Tamil Nadu (footnote 29). The latest census \ndata (2011) indicates that 16.6% of the state\u2019s urban population lives in slums.35 The lack of \naffordable housing has resulted in (i) a lack of tenure security for many of the urban poor who \nhave no option but to live in slums that are vulnerable to flooding or other hazards, and have \nlimited or no urban services; and (ii) increasing numbers of poor migrant workers in cities and \nindustrial estates who live in substandard housing, or commute considerable distances. The \nproject directly targets urban poor households in flood-prone and high-risk areas who lack security \nof tenure, and industrial and migrant workers, as beneficiaries. Sustainable livelihoods for the \nrelocated households is a key focus area. A graduation program will be piloted to ensure that \nvulnerable beneficiaries will thrive in their new location. \n \n37.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The project design addresses \nproblems faced by women and vulnerable groups, including housing unit design that is gender-\ninsensitive and culturally inadequate, a non-participatory and non-transparent relocation process, \nloss of employment and of access to basic services and government schemes, and inadequate \nhousing for low-income female migrant workers. A gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) \naction plan has been agreed and developed with GOTN. The GESI action plan ensures (i) gender \nresponsive design features are used for housing units, common areas, and sites;36 features to \nprevent  crime  through  environmental  design  will  benefit  the  elderly,  women,  children,  and \ndisabled; (ii) there is increased discussion and sharing of designs with beneficiaries (including \n40% women); (iii) the use of a sensitive and participatory relocation process that ensures women\u2019s \nparticipation in pre-relocation meetings and visits to the site; (iv) women\u2019s property rights are \nupheld by ensuring that at least 70% of titles of housing units are awarded to households headed \nby women or jointly to spouses; (v) the participation of women, transgenders, and men in the \ngraduation program, with at least 50% women beneficiaries; (vi) 50% of those recruited as paid \nanimators are women; (vii) the adoption of a monitoring and evaluation framework that includes \nGESI indicators and data disaggregated by gender identity; and (viii) the construction and \nmaintenance of WWHs for low-income female migrant workers and industrial housing for low-\nincome migrant workers. The GESI action plan also provides for gender mainstreaming training \nfor implementing agency project staff, targeting training 80% of women staff. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n38.

For output 1, an environmental assessment and review \nframework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  and \napplicable laws and regulations that will guide subproject selection, screening, and categorization; \nenvironmental  assessment;  and  the  implementation  of  potential  subprojects.  Subprojects \nclassified  as  category  A  will  not  be  considered  under  the  project.  Results  of  the  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement adequately identify project impacts and risks for the three sample subprojects (footnote \n25), and indicate that the project is unlikely to have any significant adverse environmental impacts \nthat are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented.38 Potential impacts are site-specific, and localized \nin  nature  (such  as  increased  noise  and  dust  levels,  vibration,  traffic  congestion,  potential \ninterruption to existing utilities, and waste generation) with the exception of the land use change \nthat will result in direct and irreversible impact because of the conversion of unused land to \nresidential use. IEEs and environmental management plans (EMPs) have been prepared for the \ninitial subprojects and are included in bid and contract documents. Further consultations will be \nheld along with the completion of the social census survey, and the environment safeguards \ndocumentation will be updated prior to contract award.

Reporting on the ESMS and the agreed \naction plan implementation will be submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis during project \nimplementation, and will also be publicly disclosed. Screening and categorization will be reflected \nin the subproject appraisal reports prepared by TNIFMC for the TNSF and submitted to ADB for \nclearing subprojects.40 TNIFMC capacity will be supported by hiring a senior environment expert \nunder  the  TA.  The  TA  will  support  further  capacity  building  on  environment  safeguards \ncompliance and implementation. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). For output 1, a resettlement framework has been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  applicable  laws  and \nregulations  that  will  guide  subproject  selection,  screening,  and  categorization;  resettlement \nplanning; and the implementation of future subprojects. Draft resettlement plans prepared for \nthree sample subprojects indicate physical displacement of 2,745 families, loss of income-\ngenerating assets and/or businesses, potential loss of employment, and temporary economic \n \n38 There are no internationally or nationally important biodiversity areas in the project area of influence. Physical cultural \nresources were identified near the Vallam encroachment sites but no significant adverse impact is envisioned.  \nAppropriate mitigation measures will be adopted including manual demolition and a heritage impact assessment to \nbe undertaken in consultation with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) prior to commencement of any works. Any \nASI mitigation recommendations will be incorporated into the IEE and EMP and adopted by the respective contractor. \n39 The action plan requires the ESMS categorization definitions to be in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n40 For ADB-funded subprojects, screening and categorization shall be undertaken using ADB screening categorization \nforms for involuntary settlement, indigenous peoples, and environment, including the Environment Social and \nGovernance screening checklist. These will be appended to the subproject appraisal report submitted to ADB, which \nwill also include due diligence as per the ESMS, including the agreed action plan, on environment and land \nprocurement. \n \n ", "14 \nimpacts to businesses and its employees as well as loss of common property resources and trees \nfor some families due to pipelaying.41 The proposed mitigation measures and safeguard planning \ndocuments are adequate to address the assessed impacts. The involuntary resettlement impacts \nwill be further assessed during the census survey, and the resettlement plans will be updated \nprior to contract award. TNSCB will disclose the draft resettlement plans by bid invitation stage \nand the updated resettlement plans prior to contract award on its official website; the documents \nwill be available in the local language (Tamil) to be disclosed to affected persons.42 The PMU will \nprepare quarterly social safeguards monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure, and an \nexternal monitor will undertake independent monitoring. The grievance redress mechanism is \nadequate and commensurate to the project risks and impacts. This will be the first externally aided \nproject  to  be  implemented  by  TNSCB,  although  it  has  prior  experience  in  supporting  the \nCommissionerate of Revenue Administration of Tamil Nadu in the screening, categorization, and \npreparation of social safeguards documents for the World Bank-funded Emergency Tsunami \nReconstruction Project. TNSCB staff, including its Community Development Wing, will require \ncapacity building on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. ADB has conducted \ntraining workshops on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and ADB accountability \nmechanism for TNSCB staff. The TA will support capacity building and on-the-job training of \nTNSCB staff on resettlement planning, implementation and monitoring, livelihood restoration, and \nthe graduation program on an ongoing basis. \n \n42.  For output 2, an ESMS is in place for TNIFMC (para. 40). Category A projects will not be \nconsidered for investment (footnote 37). The action plan contained in the PAM has been agreed \nto with TNFMIC for ADB-funded investments to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, \nscreening, reporting, and disclosure (para. 40). The TA will support further capacity building on \ninvoluntary resettlement. \n \n43.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will have no impacts on indigenous \npeoples within the definition of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.43  \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.

The draft \nresettlement plan for Vallam is based on the census survey. Consultations during project preparation were conducted \nwith individual households; consultations with groups of affected persons could not be undertaken because of \nCOVID-19 restrictions. The consultations began early and will continue throughout the project cycle. Information was \nshared in Tamil; the one-on-one consultations were undertaken in an atmosphere free of intimidation or coercion, \nand were gender inclusive and participatory, including participation of the vulnerable. The need for intensive, \ncontinued consultations is recognized and addressed through the detailed consultation and participation plan \nprepared for the project. ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements on meaningful consultations will be \nfollowed. \n42 In  accordance  with  Safeguards  Requirements  2  (para. 15)  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  updated \nresettlement plans will be prepared based on a census of displaced persons and the detailed measurement survey. \n43 The three sample subprojects under output 1 do not involve impacts to any person belonging to a scheduled tribe. \nThere are no particularly vulnerable tribal groups in the settlements proposed for relocation. \n44 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "15 \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nasset  management  are  O&M from the time of commissioning, and the project will provide financing for \ninadequate.  the initial years of operation.
