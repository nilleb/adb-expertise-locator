I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed line \nof  credit  of  $100,000,000  to  the  ICICI  Bank  for  financing  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency projects in India. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  There is large demand for financing small and medium-sized renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency projects in India, which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cannot directly \nparticipate in and where market penetration by local banks remains low. However, the ICICI \nBank, one of the strongest and highest-rated banks in India, has an experienced group, the \nTechnology Finance Group (TFG), that (i) has pioneered, developed, and supported a large \nrange of new and innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency projects over the past \nthree decades; and (ii) collaborates with the ICICI Bank's corporate finance, project finance, and \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises divisions to boost its lending activities to renewable energy \nand  energy  efficiency  projects.  Given  its  strong  franchise,  thorough  understanding  of  the \ncorporate credit market, and extensive experience in renewable energy and energy efficiency \nlending, the ICICI Bank is one of the most suitable candidates for intermediating funds for clean \nenergy development in India. \n \n3.  ADB is particularly keen to increase support for energy efficiency initiatives in India, and \nviews the potential cooperation with the ICICI Bank as an excellent opportunity to engage with a \nstrong  and  reputable  bank  that  has  the  reach,  capability,  and  interest  in  pursuing  energy \nefficiency projects alongside the ICICI Bank\u2019s current efforts in renewable energy. The ICICI \nBank has the appropriate experience (it has been active in clean energy investments for several \nyears)  and  a  pipeline  of  potential  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  to  be \nfinanced under the credit line. The credit line will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign loan that supports \nenergy efficiency enhancement in India. \n \n4.  The ICICI Bank will be required to use the credit line exclusively for funding projects in \npriority sectors recommended by ADB, ensuring close alignment of focus between the ICICI \nBank and ADB in promoting clean energy development in India. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n5.  The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India was formed in 1955 at the \ninitiative of the World Bank, the Government of India, and certain Indian industry representatives \nin order to create a development finance institution for providing medium- and long-term project \nfinancing  to  Indian  businesses.  Until  the  late  1980s,  the  ICICI  Bank  primarily  focused  its \nactivities on project finance, providing long-term funds to a variety of industry projects. With the \nliberalization of the finance sector in India in the 1990s, the ICICI Bank transformed its business \nfrom a development finance institution focused on project finance to a diversified financial \nservices provider offering a wide variety of products and services. \n \n6.  The ICICI Bank was incorporated in 1994 as a part of the ICICI group. Today, the ICICI \nBank is India\u2019s second-largest bank, and the largest private sector bank, with total assets of \nabout $91 billion as of March 2011. The ICICI Bank has more than 50,000 employees, is \npresent in 18 countries, has a network of more than 2,000 branches, and offers a wide range of \n ", "2 \nfinancial services to corporate and retail customers, including investment banking, insurance, \nventure capital, and asset management. \n \n7.  The ICICI Bank\u2019s TFG, which will be the key administrator of the credit line, implements \nprograms for multilateral agencies in areas of collaborative research and development, energy, \nenvironment, and health care. The TFG\u2019s initiatives include (i) attracting and channeling private \nfinancing into cleaner technologies, (ii) creating public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to mitigate \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  through  energy  efficiency,  and  (iii)  promoting  sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n \n8.  The  ICICI  Bank  has  a  pipeline  of  potential  projects  that  satisfy  the  requirements \nestablished  between  ADB  and  the  TFG  for  funding  under  the  credit  line.  The  TFG  will \nadminister, manage, and monitor the credit line in accordance with procedures to be set out in \nthe credit agreement to ensure the credit line is applied for its intended purpose. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n1.  Ownership \n \n9.  As  of  30  September  2011,  the  ICICI  Bank  was  majority  foreign-owned  through  its \nAmerican Depository Shares (26.25%), which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and \nthrough  foreign  institutional  investors  (38.17%).  The  remaining  equity  is  held  by  other \ninstitutional and non-institutional investors, including government-controlled entities.1 \n \n2.  Management \n \n10.  As a private sector entity, the ICICI Bank does not face the constraints on remunerating \nstaff faced by many of its government-owned peers. The ICICI Bank is, therefore, able to recruit \ncapable and talented young professionals for key posts within its management structure. The \nICICI Bank is known for its depth of leadership talent, which is deployed across the bank's \noperations for providing leadership to growing businesses and diverse career opportunities to \nmembers of management. The chief executive officer of the ICICI Bank is Chanda Kochhar, an \nexperienced banker with over 25 years experience with the ICICI Bank and who has headed \nmajor functions of the ICICI Bank at various times. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n \n11.  Within the Indian banking sector, the ICICI Bank is recognized as an early adopter of \nbest practices in corporate governance, with experience dating back to the mid-1990s. The \ncorporate governance framework of the ICICI Bank is based on (i) an independent board; (ii) the \nseparation  of  the  board\u2019s  supervisory  role  from  the  executive  management;  and  (iii)  the \nconstitution of board committees, generally comprising a majority of independent directors and \nchaired by an independent director, to oversee critical areas. \n \n12.  The ICICI Bank's board of directors consisted of 11 members as of 31 December 2011. \nOrganizational documents provide for a minimum of three directors and a maximum of 21 \ndirectors, not including the government-appointed director and the debenture director, if any is \nrequired. The Banking Regulation Act 1949 requires that at least 51% of the ICICI Bank's \n                                                 \n1  A breakdown of the ownership is included in the description of Ownership, Management, and Governance \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  3 \ndirectors should have special knowledge or practical experience in banking and areas relevant \nto banking including accounting, finance, agriculture, and small-scale industry. The appointment \nof the chair and executive directors requires the approval of the Reserve Bank of India and \nshareholders.  The  Government  of  India  has  appointed  one  representative  to  the  board  of \ndirectors. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n13.

The ICICI Bank is rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s and BBB\u2013 (foreign currency, long-term) by \nStandard and Poor\u2019s.  \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  ADB will provide a United States (US) dollar-denominated credit line of up to $100 \nmillion to the ICICI Bank from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.2  \n \n19.  The credit line will only be used to fund projects in priority sectors,3 identified by ADB \nbased on a comprehensive assessment of the clean energy sector and development strategy in \nIndia and drawing on various resources from ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Projects to be financed by the ADB credit line will need to satisfy the following eligibility \ncriteria: \n(i)  the TFG certifies that each project is within the renewable energy and energy \nefficiency priority sectors, \n(ii)  each  project  complies  with  all  applicable  national  laws  and  environmental \nrequirements, and \n(iii)  each project complies with applicable environmental and social requirements \nprescribed in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for category FI. \n \n21.  The ICICI Bank will comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Where ADB provides funds to an intermediary institution to be onlent to borrowers \nfor the partial financing of subprojects, procurement is to be undertaken in accordance with \n                                                 \n2  A funding application has been made to the Clean Energy Finance Partnership Facility to support the Technical \nAssistance on the Development of Energy Efficiency Projects in India. The proposed technical assistance is \nexpected to benefit not only the ICICI Bank but also other commercial banks as well as other partners from energy-\nintensive industries in India. \n3  The renewable energy and energy efficiency priority sectors to be funded by the credit line are listed in the Details \nof Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nestablished private sector or commercial practices, which are acceptable to ADB. The ICICI \nBank\u2019s capability in assessing and monitoring the procurement practices of its borrowers was \nconfirmed during due diligence. \n \n22.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  Justification for the credit line is based on the following: \n \n(i)  It will support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency \npriority sectors in India. The credit line will be used exclusively to fund projects \nin priority sectors identified by ADB; as a result, it will enable ADB to influence \nand direct a reputable bank with relevant experience to more actively pursue \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency projects in these sectors. The credit line \nwill thereby help increase, facilitate, and develop investments in the renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency sectors, with higher impacts on environmentally \nsustainable growth and climate change mitigation. \n \n(ii)  It will catalyze local commercial bank financing to support the development \nof  smaller  and  medium  sized  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \nprojects  in  India. The current rate of penetration of local commercial bank \nfinancing  to  the  smaller  and  medium  size  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency segment in India remains low. By channeling funds through a strong \nand  experienced  financial  intermediary,  the  proposed  credit  line  will  send  a \nstrong signal to the market and catalyze more local bank finance to support the \ndevelopment of this important segment. \n  \n(iii)  It will fill a market gap in terms of financing for renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency projects. The underdevelopment of the Indian financial \nmarkets, the impact of the global financial crisis, and the risk of persistent high \ninflation and the resulting policy tightening in India have significantly limited the \nability of local commercial banks to provide long-term financing for renewable \nenergy projects. The ADB credit line will help fill this market gap by providing \nlong-term funding with a flexible draw-down schedule that is not available from \nother commercial lenders in the market and cannot be secured through bond \nissuance. \n \nC.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n27.  The credit line will increase the availability of long-term financing for renewable energy \nand energy efficiency projects in India. Although the credit line will constitute only part of the \nICICI  Bank\u2019s  required  funding  for  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  it  will  have  a \nsignificant demonstration impact through the successful implementation of renewable energy \nand energy efficiency projects in the priority sectors identified by ADB. This will lead to a \nreduction in the perceived risk associated with such projects, and will encourage the replication \nof similar projects. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n28.  The credit line\u2019s expected outcome will be an increased number of projects developed in \nthe renewable energy and energy efficiency priority sectors in India, with support from the ICICI \nBank. \n \n3.  Output \n \n29.  The credit line\u2019s output will be an expansion of the ICICI Bank\u2019s lending activities to \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency projects and initiatives throughout India within ADB \npriority sectors.4 \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n30.  Strategy 20205 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for environmentally sustainable development \nthat would expand ADB\u2019s promotion of, and investment in, sound environmental management \nwhile simultaneously capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operational strengths. The strategy seeks to meet \nthe  region\u2019s  growing  energy  demand  by  helping  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to \ndevelop environmentally friendly technologies, specifically addressing energy efficiency and \nexpanding the use of clean energy sources. One of the key actions is to mitigate climate change \nby moving DMCs on to low-carbon growth paths by, among other things, improving energy \nefficiency, expanding the use of clean energy sources, and reducing fugitive greenhouse gas \nemissions. Furthermore, under Strategy 2020, ADB seeks to strengthen its support to the \nfinance sector at the regional and national levels by helping to develop financial infrastructure, \ninstitutions, and products and services. The credit line will provide systemic support for the \nIndian banking sector by contributing to increased lending to renewable energy and energy \nefficiency  projects,  which  is  an  essential  component  in  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment and directly in line with Strategy 2020. \n \n                                                 \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n5  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "6 \n31.  ADB\u2019s energy program in the Indian country partnership strategy approved in 20096 aims \nto enhance the impact of the government\u2019s initiatives for demand- and supply-related programs. \nThe planned activities include (i) developing renewable and alternative energy sources, and \nclean generation technology; (ii) reducing technical and commercial losses in transmission and \ndistribution networks and facilities; (iii) strengthening interregional transmission capacity; (iv) \nbringing  demand-side  management  and  energy  conservation  into  the  mainstream;  and  (v) \npromoting  private  sector  participation,  while  ensuring  environmental  sustainability  and \nsupporting institutional strengthening to implement the reforms required by the Electricity Act of \n2003. The credit line is also consistent with ADB's latest country operations business plan for \nIndia  2011\u20132013,7 which  requires  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  be  further \nmainstreamed into ADB operations. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n32.  The credit line is aligned with both the energy and finance sector strategies of ADB. \nUnder its Energy Policy,8 ADB\u2019s investments will focus on energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy projects, as well as the expansion of energy access. Starting in 2013, ADB will increase \nits target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from $1 billion, in a bid to accelerate \nlow-carbon  growth  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  region.  In  particular,  the \nEnergy Policy calls for ADB to expand its energy efficiency operations \u201cin the industry sector by \ncollaborating  with  industry  associations,  domestic  banks,  and  specialized  energy  efficiency \nagencies and energy service companies.\u201d As such, climate change finance has been elevated \nas a new area of focus in ADB\u2019s private sector operations since 2010.9 Supporting finance \nsector development is a key focus of development assistance for ADB, in line with the tenets \ndetailed  in  ADB's  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy10 and  enhanced  poverty  reduction \nstrategy,11 which note improved economic growth, stimulated by private sector investment, as a \nkey contributing factor in reducing poverty. ADB's Private Sector Development Strategy refers \nspecifically  to  ADB's  role  in  strengthening  the  finance  sector  in  DMCs.  The  credit  line  is \nconsistent with the overall sector strategies in that it will increase access to financial services for \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency project developers and assist in the development of the \nfinance sector, thereby making private sector development more sustainable and ADB\u2019s mission \nof economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction more achievable. \n \n33.  Furthermore,  the  credit  line  will  support  the  promotion  of  PPPs  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, a priority area of ADB\u2019s finance sector operations in India. In 2006, ADB approved \na $45 million equity investment in the Infrastructure Development Finance Company Ltd Private \nEquity  Fund  II.12 In  2007  and  2009,  ADB  approved  two  multitranche  financing  facilities \namounting to $1.2 billion to support infrastructure development through PPPs. Both multitranche \nfinancing facilities were channeled through a financial intermediary\u2014the India Infrastructure \nFinance  Company\u2014and  the  model  proved  effective.  The  recently  proposed  Catalyzing \nSustainable Finance Facility will also be a financial intermediation loan to the Housing and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009.

", "  7 \nUrban  Development  Corporation.13 Similarly,  the  credit  line  will  be  provided  to  a  financial \nintermediary to promote private sector participation in sustainable infrastructure development in \nIndia. \n \n34.  The credit line will be applied only towards projects within renewable energy and energy \nefficiency priority sectors as determined in consultation with energy experts within ADB. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n35.  A recent draft evaluation knowledge brief concludes that energy efficiency in industry \nand buildings should be promoted through commercial financing, and in particular through lines \nof credit dedicated to financing projects that qualify as energy efficiency investments.14 The draft \nevaluation  knowledge  brief  also  highlights  the  importance  of  identifying  \u201clocal  financial \nintermediaries  that  are  interested  in  energy  efficiency  lending\u201d  and  of  letting  the  financial \nintermediary \u201cidentify, appraise, and approve a subloan itself, without further approvals from any \ngovernment body or a development partner\u201d. Finally, energy efficiency interventions need not be \nbig and broad to start with; at times it is best to start with small, narrowly focused programs and \nto increase the scope and sophistication over time. \n \n36.  Close collaboration between the public and private sectors is required to tackle the \ninfrastructure bottleneck in India. Previously, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and \nSouth Asia Regional Department have jointly supported the development of Bangalore metro \nsystem to promote PPP in infrastructure development. The design of the credit line, especially \nfor the energy efficiency component, has also benefited from collaboration between ADB\u2019s \npublic and private operations departments.      \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n37.  The credit line is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The ICICI \nBank will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited activities list, and ensure that investments using ADB funds \ncomply  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and Social Protection Strategy.15 The ICICI Bank will establish an ESMS satisfactory \nto ADB, including the appointment of a designated staff member responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation of the ESMS before the first disbursement, and maintain it throughout the tenor \nof the facility to manage the impacts and risks of existing and/or likely future portfolios. An \nESMS framework has been prepared to provide guidance to develop and maintain an ESMS.16 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n38.  The ICICI Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2011.
