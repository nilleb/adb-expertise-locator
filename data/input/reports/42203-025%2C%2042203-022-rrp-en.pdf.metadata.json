In 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $23 million \ngrant  to  finance  the  Northern  Rural  Infrastructure  Development  Sector  Project.2 Based  on  the \ncurrent  project\u2019s  good  performance  and  solid  achievements,  the  government  and  the  ADB \nproject  team  concluded  that  PRI  investments  should  be  scaled-up  to  broaden  the  benefits  of \nincreased  rural  incomes  and  economic  development.  The  additional  financing  will  enable  the \ncontinued  improvement  of  PRI,  consisting  of  small  and  medium-sized  gravity-fed  irrigation \nschemes  and rural  access  to  and  within the  schemes.  It  will  support  the  implementation of 22 \nnew PRI subprojects, in addition to the 26 subprojects already completed in the current project. \nWith  the  additional  financing,  the  overall  project  will  strengthen  the  (i)  water  user  groups \n(WUGs) to manage PRI and the associated watersheds, and (ii) farmer producer groups (FPGs) \nto coordinate with markets. The inclusion of women, poor people, and ethnic groups will remain \na  priority.  Consistent  with  the  current  project,  the  additional  financing  will  lead  to  increased \nagricultural productivity, diversification, and commercialization, resulting in higher incomes in the \nsubproject  areas.  Moreover,  PRI  is  essential  to  counter  the  impacts  of  climate  instability  on \nagricultural production. The current project\u2019s approach and structure remain valid.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nSome 70% of the Lao PDR population continues to be engaged in agriculture, and over \n3. \n50%  of  households  are  smallholder  farmers.  The  average  poverty  rate  in  the  four  project \nprovinces  is  26%.  Significantly,  73%  of  the  residents  are  from  ethnic  groups  that  have  little \nopportunity  to  integrate  into  the  market  economy.  The  northern  region  is  still  dominated  by \nsubsistence  production  on  rain-fed  lowlands,  as  well  as  upland  shifting  cultivation.  The  poor \nquality  and inadequate coverage of  PRI  constrain agricultural  production,  especially  in the  dry \nseason,  resulting  in  limited  areas  being  planted,  low  yields,  limited  diversity  of  produce,  high \nproduction and marketing costs, and consequently, low rural incomes.4 \n \n4. \nDeveloping  PRI  is  a  high  priority  of  the  government\u2019s  Five  Year  National  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  VIII,  2016\u20132020  and  Agriculture  Development  Strategy  to  2025 \nand Vision to the Year 2030 because (i) it is crucial to reducing the risk associated with rain-fed \nagriculture,  (ii)  it  enhances  productivity,  and  (iii)  it  provides  options  for  diversifying  into  new \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2010.  Report and  Recommendation  of the  President to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  the  Lao \n\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Northern Rural Infrastructure Development Sector Project. Manila. \n\n3   ADB  provided  project  preparatory \n\nthe  Northern  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Sector Project\u2014Due Diligence of Additional Financing (TA 8882-LAO). This was complemented by \nresources  from  the  current  project  which  were  used  to  carry  out  subproject  impact  studies  and  two  feasibility \nstudies. \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nfor  Preparing \n\n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncrops  with  higher  potential  for  profit. 5  Given  the  importance  of  PRI,  the  government\u2019s  last \nirrigation  diagnostic  study  completed  in  2008,  needs  to  be  updated  immediately.6 Improving \nrural access to and within the irrigation schemes facilitates the mobility of the local population, \nand  the  movement  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs,  increasing  production  efficiency. \nInvestments  in  PRI  have  enhanced  agricultural  productivity  by  securing  supplementary  water \nsupplies through the wet season and, where possible, providing water for dry season cropping. \nADB has supported the development of transport corridors and regional economic integration in \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion, which has increasingly made markets accessible for Lao PDR \nproduce and will be further enhanced by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic \nCommunity. The  overall  project  remains  consistent  with the  midterm review  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy \n2020, as well as the operational plans for agriculture and natural resources, and water.7 \n \nStrong  positive  impacts  and  key  lessons. Socioeconomic impact studies on the first \n5. \nthree  completed  subprojects  showed  year  round  increased  areas  under  cultivation,  with \nsignificant  cropping  diversity,  especially  during  the  dry  season.  WUGs  are  providing  the \nbackbone  for  PRI  sustainability  through  organized  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  are \nevolving into FPGs that can negotiate production contracts with traders for more commercially \noriented production. Market demand for the crops produced is high in Lao PDR and neighboring \ncountries,  especially  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  These  developments  have  underpinned \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs), which average 22%, and from 2010 to 2015 a 92% \nincrease in average annual household incomes of $1,320 in the subprojects areas.8 \n  \n \n6. \nProject  performance.  The  current  project  is  performing  well  and  is  on  track,  as \nrecorded  in  all  project  progress  reports,      review  mission  aide-m\u00e9moire,  and  as  measured  by \nindicators. 9  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  has \nADB\u2019s  performance \ndemonstrated  the  capacity  to  implement  ADB-financed  projects  effectively.  As  of  31  January \n2017, the current project has achieved (i) good construction quality and the completion of all 26 \nPRI  subprojects,  within  budget,  and  well  before  the  project  closing  date; 10  (ii)  99.6% \nimplementation  progress  against  the  elapsed  grant  period  of  just  over  91.4%,  with  cumulative \ncontract  awards  at  $20.54  million  (89%)  and  disbursements  at  $20.84  million  (91%);  and  (iii) \neffective management  of  identified  risks,  and  timely  and  satisfactory  compliance  with  all  grant \ncovenants, including those concerned with financial management and safeguards. \n \n7. \nSignificant  benefits  in  excess  of  those  originally  predicted  have  led  to  strong \ndemand by the government and beneficiaries for additional financing\u2014first recorded during the \nmidterm  review  in  April  2014.  The  importance  of  this  well-performing  project  is  shown  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s prioritization of this project for ADB\u2019s resources, which will be used to scale up the \n                                                \n5  The  Government  of  Lao  PDR,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment.  2015.

Based  upon  the  provincial  development  plans,  candidate \nsubprojects have been identified, screened against eligibility criteria  and prioritized, have been \nagreed  among  MAF,  the  participating  provinces,  and  ADB,  for  inclusion  in  the  overall \nsubproject, contingent upon successful feasibility study confirmation.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  impact  of  the  overall  project  will  be  improved  rural  household  incomes  in  the  four \nnorthern provinces of Bokeo, Louang-Namtha, Oudomxai, and Phongsali. The outcome will be \nincreased  agricultural  productivity  in  the  four  northern  provinces  of  Bokeo,  Louang-Namtha, \nOudomxai, and Phongsali. The impact and outcome remain unchanged from the current project, \nbut the aggregated impacts and outcomes of the overall project will increase as the geographic \ncoverage has been expanded to 22 new subprojects  and 5,100 additional households. A total \nof 9,100 households will benefit directly from the project. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe current project\u2019s four outputs will be scaled up as described below. \n\n9. \n \n10. \nOutput 1: Production and productivity-enhancing rural infrastructure constructed \nand/or rehabilitated. The implementation of PRI subprojects represents the bulk of the project \ninvestment. The current project  completed 26 subprojects covering 5,300 hectares (ha), which \nis a much greater area than the target of 2,900 ha. An additional 22 subprojects covering about \n6,800  ha  will  be  implemented  through  the  additional  financing.  The  48  total  subprojects  will \ncomprise about 12,100 ha of irrigated command area and 225 kilometers of rural access road.12 \nPRI  subprojects  will  be  extended  to  three  new  districts  in  the  overall  project. 13 Subproject \nfeasibility studies on two representative subprojects in the new districts were carried out during \nproject preparation and confirmed subproject viability.14 \n \n11. \nOutput  2:  Productivity  and  impact-enhancing  initiatives  adopted.  Initiatives  to \nenhance the impact and sustainability of investments in PRI will continue. They will be identified \nin  a  participatory  and  gender-sensitive  manner  from  options  developed  with  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries, including (i) strengthening technical extension services to WUGs; (ii) establishing \n48  FPGs  to  coordinate  supplies  of  agricultural  produce  to  markets  and/or  processors; \n(iii) supporting contracted agricultural production; and (iv) implementing initiatives to secure land \ntenure for 5,000 WUG members and to protect the health of 48 watersheds. Capacity building \nwill  continue  to  ensure  that  women  and  vulnerable  ethnic  groups  have  the  necessary  skills  to \nparticipate fully in, and benefit from, project activities.  \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2011.

The  additional  financing  will \n\nsupport 22 subprojects, amalgamating 73 sub-schemes. \n\n13 The  subprojects  are  and  will  be  implemented  in  the  districts  of  (i)  Houayxay,  Paktha,  and  Pha-Oudom  in  Bokeo \nprovince; (ii) Long and Sing in Louang-Namtha province; (iii) Beng (new) and Houn (new) in Oudomxai province; \nand (iv) Boun-Nua (new), Boun-Tai, and Gnod-Ou in Phongsali province. \n\n14 Subproject Feasibility Study for Nam Beng; and Subproject Feasibility Study for Nam Oun (accessible from the list \n\nof supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n12. \nOutput 3: Capacities of national, provincial, and district agencies strengthened to \nenable  a  sector  development  approach.  Capacity  building  in  MAF\u2014as  well  as  improving \nimplementation capacity for staff at the national project management office (NPMO), provincial \nproject  offices  (PPO),  and  district  coordination  offices\u2014are  largely  completed  but  will  be \ncontinued to target the three new districts. An irrigation subsector review will also be carried out. \n \n13. \nOutput  4:  Project  managed  and  subprojects  delivered  efficiently  and  effectively. \nThe  NPMO  and  the  PPOs  will  continue  to  manage  the  project.  Regular  ADB  review  missions \nconfirm  that  established  financial,  administrative,  procurement,  and  reporting  systems  are \neffective  and  will  be  continued.  Consulting  services  for  implementation  support  and  technical \nexpertise will be extended or recruited as required. \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost $62.2 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \na   Refers  to  the  amount  of  the  original  project.

ADB  project \nthat  existing \nimplementation  arrangements  are  effective  and  will  be  continued.  MAF,  as  the  executing \nagency,  will  have  responsibility  for  overall  project  coordination  and  management.  The  NPMO \nwill be responsible for day-to-day operations, will report to MAF and ADB, and will carry out all \nmajor recruitment and procurement activities with the current staff. \n \n18. \nThe established provincial steering committees will continue to be responsible for project \ncoordination  within  each  province.  The  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  offices  (PAFOs)  will \ncontinue to be the implementing agencies, with responsibility for reporting to the provincial vice-\ngovernor  and the  NPMO.  PPOs  established  within  the  PAFOs  will  continue  to  provide  day-to-\nday  support  for  the  implementation  of  project  activities  and  facilitate  inputs  from  relevant \nprovincial line departments for subproject design and implementation. PPOs will be managed by \na  provincial  project  coordinator  from  the  PAFOs  and  one  full-time  deputy  coordinator.  The \nestablished  district  coordination  offices  will  ensure  that  consultations  are  carried  out  with \nprovincial  and  district  stakeholder  agencies  and  village  authorities.  Meetings  will  be  arranged \nwith  WUGs,  FPGs,  village  leaders,  and  poor  households  to  identify  their  needs  and  raise \nawareness  to  enable  access  to  benefits,  including  training  and  village-level  participation  in \nsubproject planning and implementation. \n \n19. \nProject management has been supported by an implementation consulting firm recruited \nunder  the  current  project.  MAF  confirmed  that  the  firm  provided  highly  satisfactory  services, \nwhich  are  still  needed  to  support  the  additional  financing.  Continuing  the  firm\u2019s  consulting \nservices  is  in  the  overall  interest  of  the  project  implementation  and  enhances  economy  and \nefficiency.  Therefore,  the  firm\u2019s  contract  will  be  extended  to  cover  the  new  project  scope, \nthrough  a  contract  variation.17 Separate  consulting  packages  will  be  procured  for  engineering \ndesign and construction supervision,  through advance actions, to prepare the detailed designs \nand contract documents for the two representative subprojects. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n20. \nPRI  uses  basic  engineering  designs  and  can  be  constructed  by  local  contractors. \nClimate  instability  is  anticipated  and  a  number  of  countermeasures  will  be  taken,  including \n(i) strengthening  the  weir  design  to  withstand  more  intense  stream  flows;  (ii) constructing \npassages to reduce stress on aquatic life by enabling aquatic migration up- and downstream of \nthe weirs; (iii) concrete-lining canals to the extent possible for more efficient utilization of water; \n(iv) increasing the stability of the PRI and the health of the watersheds through soil and water \nconservation initiatives; and (v) involving WUGs and FPGs in the implementation of watershed \nmanagement  plans.  ADB  and  MAF  prescreened  all  proposed  subprojects  for  initial  technical, \nfinancial, economic, and social viability, as well as for safeguard issues.18 \n \n\n                                                \n17 The  terms  of  reference  for  the  implementation  consultants  are  in  the  PAM  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n18 Field Survey Report (Subproject Screening) (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  representative  subprojects  in  Nam  Beng  and  Nam  Oun  will  rehabilitate  PRI  to \nenable year round irrigated agriculture, resulting in increased cropping intensity. The economic \nand  financial  analysis  considers  as  benefits  only  those  that  are  quantifiable  and  directly \nattributable  to  PRI  improvement.  These  include  (i)  increased  yield  and  cropping  intensity,  (ii) \ncrop diversification, and (iii) reduced transportation costs from the farm gate to the rice mills or \nlocal markets. Benefits that are difficult to quantify include enhanced market integration through \nPRI development, and associated investments in technical extension services and strengthened \nFPGs.  Through  supply  contracts  with  private  traders,  farmers  will  gain  access  to  agricultural \ninputs,  credit,  and  downstream  production  services.  The  market  risk  is  reduced  since  the \ncontracts  typically  indicate  the  prices  and  contracted  quantities  in  advance.  This  potential \nsource of benefit is omitted in the analysis since the terms of the contracts are not yet specified. \n \n22. \nThe average household farm size in the subproject areas is 0.9 ha in Nam Beng and 1.0 \nha in Nam Oun. Based on local prices, yields, cropping intensities and patterns, the economic \nvalue  of  the  annual  agricultural  incomes  is  computed  for  both  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. The difference represents the incremental project benefit that accrues to the farmers, \nand is compared with the project costs. On an incremental basis, the estimated EIRR is 18.6% \nin Nam Beng and 17.0% in Nam Oun; both are above the 12.0% economic opportunity cost of \ncapital.19 Sensitivity  analyses  show  that  the  representative  subprojects  are most  sensitive  to  a \ndecrease in benefits, but the EIRRs remain above the economic opportunity cost of capital. \n \n23. \nThe financial analysis indicates that irrigated and diversified farming will generate a high \nfinancial  rate  of  return.  The  average  farm  should  be  able  to  generate  a  net  incremental  crop \nincome of  KN4.3 million  in Nam  Beng  (267%  increase)  and  KN4.9 million  in Nam  Oun  (328% \nincrease)  as  a  result  of  completing  the  representative  subprojects.20 This  provides  a  strong \nincentive  for  farmers  to  adopt  high-yielding  technologies  and  collectively  contribute  labor  and \nmonetary inputs for the routine operation and maintenance of the subprojects. Meeting recurrent \nO&M costs continues to be a challenge for the government, so the input of WUGs to O&M will \nremain essential. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe financial management assessment indicates that, with the capacity established and \nwith the  support  of  the  implementation consultants,  MAF  is  capable of continuing the financial \nmanagement  of  the  overall  project.21 The  NPMO  will  ensure  the  consolidated  project  financial \nstatements  are  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with \ninternational  auditing  standards  and  the  government\u2019s  audit  regulations.  MAF  will  submit  the \naudited project financial statements in English to ADB within 6 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear.  The  project  will  continue  operating  a  website  for  disclosure  of  implementation  progress, \nbid  notifications  and  results,  and  a  grievance  mechanism  for  corrupt  practices  and  for  people \nwho may be negatively affected by the project. \n \n25.  MAF  has  extensive  experience  and  capacity  for  managing  externally  funded  projects, \nincluding  those  of  ADB.  All  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants  to  be  financed  by  the \nADB grant will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \n                                                \n19 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Without the project, annual income is about KN1.6 million in Nam Beng and KN1.5 million in Nam Oun. With the \n\nproject, annual income is estimated at KN5.9 million in Nam Beng and KN6.4 million in Nam Oun. \n\n21 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The government\u2019s \npublic  procurement  legislation  and  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for \npackages  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  and  shopping  procedures.  PPOs  will \ninvolve  district  and  lower  administrative  units,  and  communities  to  ensure  their  participation  in \nmonitoring PRI subproject design and construction.  \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM and will be posted on the project website.22 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe average poverty rate in northern rural Lao PDR is 26%, down from 31% in 2008.23 \n27. \nRural poverty is close to three times as prevalent as urban poverty. Many of the PRI subprojects \nare in areas where a significant number of beneficiaries are members of ethnic groups. Poverty \nis  highest  among the  non-Lao  and non-Thai  ethnic  groups\u201435%  among the  Hmong-Lu Mien, \n34%  among  the  Mon-Khmer,  and  32%  among  the  Chine-Tibet.  These  three  ethnic  groups \ncomprise over 73% of the population of the project\u2019s four provinces. Food insecurity rates vary, \nreaching  22%  in  rural  households  classified  as  having  poor  or  borderline  levels  of  food \nconsumption.  The  health,  nutrition,  and  literacy  indicators  of  people  living  in  remote  areas  are \nalso significantly lower than national averages, particularly for ethnic women. \n\n \n28. \nPRI  investments  have  been  improving  the  incomes  and  food  security  of  beneficiary \nhouseholds.  The  associated  initiatives  provide  opportunities  for  rural  people  to  build  their \ncapacities  to  derive  improved  agriculture-based  livelihoods.  The  project  will  provide  resources \nfor  implementing  subproject  gender  action  plans  and  ethnic  group  development  plans.  As \nwomen  are  greatly  underrepresented  in  village  and  community  decision-making  institutions, \ninterventions  will  increase  their  involvement  in  WUGs  and  FPGs.  Vulnerable  groups,  mainly \nethnic  groups  and  households  headed  by  women,  will  receive  preferential  employment \nopportunities for construction  activities. The improved PRI will intensify agricultural activity and \nincrease demand for labor and services, leading to income-generating opportunities. No major \nnegative social impacts have occurred during implementation of the current project.  \n \n29. \nGender  (effective  gender  mainstreaming).  The  poverty,  social,  and  gender  due \ndiligence  conducted  for  the  current  project  remains  valid;  and  confirms  the  effective  gender \nmainstreaming  classification  for  the  overall  project.  The  gender  action  plan  has  been  updated \nbased  on  (i) equitable  project  benefits  and  opportunity  sharing  between  men  and  women; \n(ii) gender-sensitive approaches to reduce gender inequalities in the project areas; (iii) targeted \napproaches  for  training  women,  including  those  in  ethnic  groups;  (iv)  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  for  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (v)  increased  representation  of \nwomen in decision-making bodies.24 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement (category  B). The resettlement framework was updated and \n30. \nagreed  with  the  government  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).25 \nResettlement  and  land  acquisition  impacts  are  limited  since  the  subprojects  will  rehabilitate \n                                                \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fexisting  infrastructure,  and  prescreening  ensured  that  none  of  the  subprojects  would  entail \nsignificant  resettlement  or  land  acquisition. 26 Resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  for  minor \ncompensation that may be needed, in accordance with the resettlement framework. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n31. \nagreed by the government and ADB was updated based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and resources for its implementation have been allocated.27 Subproject prescreening has \neliminated  subprojects  with  significant  negative  environmental  impacts.  Minor  impacts  will  be \nmitigated by implementing the subproject environmental management plans prepared as part of \neach  initial  environmental  examination.  Subproject  feasibility  studies  will  ensure  that  water \nofftake  during  the  dry  season  allows  sufficient  flows  to  maintain  the  riparian  ecosystem  and \nadequate  resources  for  downstream  users.  Irrigation  weirs  may  hamper  aquatic  life  migration \nand stress fish stocks. Aquatic life passages will be made a standard weir design feature. The \nintensification  of  agriculture  will  bring  long-term  benefits  to  farmers  but  may  also  increase  the \nuse of agrochemicals. The environmental management plans will address risks associated with \nthe  use  of  agrochemicals  and  the  promotion  of  sustainable  land-use  practices,  through \nawareness  raising  and  training.  Supporting  WUG  and  FPG  members  in  obtaining  land \nownership certificates is expected to catalyze good land and watershed stewardship. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  Peoples  (category  B).  The  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework: \nEthnic  Groups  Development  Framework28agreed  by  the  government  and  ADB  was  updated, \nand resources were allocated to prepare ethnic group development plans for potential category \nB  subprojects  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 29  The  overall  project \nactivities  will  not  cause  (i)  involuntary  changes  in  ethnic  groups\u2019  livelihood  systems,  cultural \npractices,  ancestral  domains,  food  production  practices,  or  cultural  cohesion;  (ii)  unwanted \ndependence  on  external  market  forces;  or  (iii)  the  exclusion  of  any  ethnic  group.  Possible \nnegative impacts will be avoided  when possible or will be compensated. Impacts are expected \nto be overwhelmingly positive since activities are for the socioeconomic improvement of the total \npopulation.  All  data  collected  will  be  disaggregated  by  ethno-linguistic  group,  age  (where \nappropriate), and gender to allow the monitoring and evaluation of beneficiary inclusion. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPublic financial management: \nweak regulatory systems and \nskills; inadequate financing of \nO&M \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nTraining has enabled the project accounting unit to develop sufficient capacity \nwithin the NPMO and the implementing agencies. The GIC will provide support as \nneeded. Any financial staff changes will be agreed with ADB. WUGs are effectively \ncarrying out O&M independent of public financing. \n\n                                                \n26 Based on feasibility studies of representative subprojects and initial prescreening, the total cost of land acquisition \n\nand resettlement is estimated to be $268,000, or 2% of civil works costs. \n\n27 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Hmong, Khmou, and Lao are the major indigenous peoples in the project area; and fall under the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  description  of  indigenous  peoples.  The  government  refers  to  indigenous  peoples  as \n\u201cethnic  groups\u201d  (Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2003.  Constitution  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic. \nVientiane [article 8]). \n\n29 Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework:  Ethnic  Groups  Development  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nProcurement: weak regulatory \nsystems and staff skills \n\nCorruption: high perceived \nlevels \n\nEnvironmental sustainability \nand climate change: increasing \nstress on water and land \necosystems \n\nGlobal: vulnerable to external \nshocks and price fluctuations \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe trained NPMO procurement staff will be supported by the GIC, and any staff \nchanges will be agreed with ADB. ADB will provide prior review for consulting \nrecruitment and NCB contracts according to the procurement plan. \nProject accounts will be closely monitored by the resident mission with twice annual \nreviews. Mechanisms for reporting corruption are in place. ADB will build \nstakeholder awareness of its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). \nThe Project will: (i) build capacity and raise awareness of potential climate impacts \nand introduce farming methods and appropriate crop varieties; (ii) support land \ntenure and watershed management; (iii) construct climate resilient PRI to enable \nfarmers to better manage water resources; and (iv) carry out an irrigation subsector \nreview to strengthen sector planning, investment and implementation. \nStrong demand for food is forecast. The capacity of WUGs and FPGs will be \nimproved to diversify and commercialize production. The project will closely monitor \nthe establishment of FPG supply contracts, land-use maps, and land registration \nwhich will contribute to achieving production targets. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  FPG  =  farmer  producer  group,  GIC = grant  implementation  consultant \nNCB = national  competitive  bidding,  NPMO  =  national  project  management  office,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance, PRI = productive rural infrastructure, WUG = water user group. \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n \n34.  With  the  mitigation  measures  to  be  put  in  place,  the  overall  risk  assessment  is \nconsidered  low,  and  the  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  project  will  far  outweigh  the  estimated \ncosts.
