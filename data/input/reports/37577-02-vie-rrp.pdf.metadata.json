Subprogram 2 is \nbuilt  on  earlier  initiatives  to  help  address  the  continuing  need  for  financial  sector  development  in \nViet  Nam.  The  first  Financial  Sector  Program  (1996\u20132002)  facilitated  the  developing  of  legal  and \nregulatory  foundations  for  commercial  banking.2 The  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  (2002\u2013\n2006)  promoted  the  development  of  the  nonbank  financial  subsector,  particularly  insurance  and \nleasing, and the anti-money laundering regime.3 \n \nThe objective of the Third Financial Sector Program4 is to create a more diversified, deeper, \n3. \nand  more  resilient  financial  sector.  By  increasing  the  share  of  nonbank  financial  markets  in \nfinancing investment, the program will contribute to enabling sustained growth in the economy with \nreduced  risks  due  to  funding  mismatch.  Greater  scope  and  efficiency  of  alternative  nonbank \nfinancial intermediation channels will strengthen stability of the financial sector through increased \ncompetition. Financial sector reforms aimed at mitigating risks of sector instability help reduce the \nvulnerability of the poor falling into poverty arising from financial sector crisis. This is supported by \nthe recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) study involving 65 developing countries, which found \nthat  (i)  financial  sector  development  raises  economic  growth  and  reduces  poverty,  (ii)  financial \nsector development directly reduces poverty by increasing the investment and interest incomes of \nthe  20%  poorest  households,  and  (iii)  financial  sector  instability  directly  reduces  incomes  of  the \npoor thereby increasing poverty.5 \n \n4. \nThe program cluster comprises two subprograms covering the period from January 2006 to \nSeptember  2010.  The  program  is  in  line  with  Strategy  20206 as  well  as  the  government\u2019s  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 and ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2007\u20132010,7 \nwhich all support business-led pro-poor growth by promoting infrastructure development, creating a \nbusiness-enabling environment, and developing diversified financial intermediation. A total loan of \n$135  million  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  was  allotted  for  the  program\u2014$75  million  for \nsubprogram 1 and $60 million for subprogram 2. \n \n5. \nSubprogram 1. Actions under subprogram 1 were undertaken in two phases from January \n2006  to  February  2009.  At  the  request  of  the  government,  the  implementation  period  for  the \nsecond  tranche  was  extended  to  31  December  2009  to  allow  for  additional  time  to  complete  the \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  1996.

The successful completion of subprogram 1 justifies the program loan to proceed with \nimplementation of subprogram 2.  \n\n6. \nSubprogram  2.  Actions  under  subprogram  2  cover  the  period  from  March  2009  until \nSeptember  2010.  The  subprogram  focus  is  on  development  of  securities  and  bond  markets; \nincreasing  transparency  disclosure;  and  strengthening  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  enforcement \nframeworks.  It  provides  support  for  government  efforts  to  strengthen  regional  cooperation  by \nenhancing cooperation with regulators in other securities markets in the region. \n \n7. \nThe focus of priorities under subprogram 2 has been refined since its formulation in 2006 to \nreflect  the  impact  and  lessons  from  the  global  financial  crisis  (2008\u20132009)  and  the  need  to \nemphasize  measures  to  strengthen  financial  stability.  The  refinement  includes  additional  and \nexplicit emphasis on financial stability and human resource development. With these refinements, \nthe program loan now comprises 21 policy actions of which 14 are core actions that have all been \naccomplished. The remaining 7 actions are completed milestones.10 The development policy letter \nis in Appendix 3 and the policy matrix and post-program partnership framework are in Appendix 4.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nFinancial sector development in transitional economies is a complex, long-term effort. Over \n8. \nthe  past  decade,  the  government  has  embarked  on  financial  sector  reform  to  transform  and \nmodernize  the  country\u2019s  financial  sector.  Through  program  and  TA  (footnotes  2-4),  ADB  has \nsupported the government in addressing these critical bottlenecks in financial sector infrastructure, \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  ADB  Country  Assistance \nProgram Evaluation for Viet Nam recommended a continuous support for the financial sector.11  \n \n9. \nFinancial sector reforms require support over the medium to long term. Reforms supported \nunder this and earlier programs have been integral to supporting Viet Nam\u2019s gradual transition from \na  centrally  planned  to  a  market-based  economy  and  in  helping  the  government  achieve  and \nsustain high rates of economic growth. This was instrumental in the country's remarkable progress \nwith poverty reduction over the last decade. Viet Nam's recent rapid rate of economic growth has \nbeen underpinned by record investment.12 Investment by the private sector, moreover, has grown \nmuch faster than that by the public sector. Following the acceleration of economic reforms, private \nsector investment has supplanted the public sector as the main contributor to capital accumulation \nduring the program period, accounting for over 60% of total capital accumulation by 2007.13  \n \n\n                                                 \n8  The first tranche of $30 million was released on 13 June 2008, and the second tranche of $45 million was released in \n\nDecember 2009. \n\n9  ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n12 Increasing from some 35% of GDP in 2001 to a remarkable 45% by 2007. \n13 The same share the public sector held in 2001. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \nBanks  dominate  intermediation.  While  progress  in  developing  the  financial  sector  has \nbeen impressive, banking continues to dominate the sector\u2014in particular state-owned commercial \nbanks, which account for 51% of total aggregate loans. The IMF 2010 Article IV Consultation with \nVietnam concludes that one of the fundamental problems facing Viet Nam is overbanking.14 Overall \nasset  quality  of  the  banking  system  has  not  been  challenged  by  the  financial  crisis  as \nnonperforming  loans  only  accounted  for  2.2%  in  June  2009.  However,  constraints  for  the \ncontinuing intermediation of banking include the limited scale of operations, credit risk, and funding \nmismatches.  By  increasing  the  share  of  nonbank  financial  markets  in  financing  investments, \nsubprogram  2  will  continue  to  enable  sustained  high  economic  growth  with  reduced  risks  due  to \nfunding mismatch.  \n \n11.  Micro-prudential  measures  and  major  legal  reform  for  banking.  In  an  effort  to \nstrengthen  the  financial  stability  of  the  banking  system,  the  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  (SBV) \nintroduced  a  number  of  key  micro-prudential  measures  and  initiated  major  legal  reforms  for  the \nSBV  Law  and  Credit  Institutions  Law.  To  improve  banking  capitalization,  SBV  identified \nconsolidation  of  private  joint  stock  banks  as  a  priority  along  with  equitization  of  state-owned \ncommercial banks. It increased the minimum charter capital of joint stock banks to D3 trillion to be \nmet  by  the  end  of  2010.  Other  key  measures  include  a  new  solvency  ratio  and  corporate \ngovernance  requirements  for  banks,  the  extension  of  the  bankruptcy  law  to  commercial  banks, \nformalization  of  SBV  powers  to  place  banks  under  special  control,  and  the  establishment  of \nregulations to govern bank mergers.  \n \n12.  Measured  progress  in  capital  markets.  The  number  of  publicly  listed  companies  in  the \nHo Chi Minh City and Hanoi stock exchanges has increased significantly, from 41 in 2005 to 457 in \n2009, and to 549 as of June 2010. Likewise, initial public offerings of equities averaged 3.25% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) for 2006\u20132009, reaching a peak of 9.14% in 2007. The total market \ncapitalization  value  of  Viet  Nam  of  approximately  $39  billion  is  still  small  compared  with  other \ncountries  in  the  region.  However,  if  state-owned  enterprise  reforms,  including  their  equitization, \nremain on track, the size of the stock market may approach that of the Philippines ($76 billion) and \nThailand  ($166  billion).  The  State  Securities  Commission  (SSC)  has  taken  steps  to  enhance  its \nsupervisory  capacity.  The  country  now  has  105  registered  securities  firms  and  46  fund \nmanagement companies. \n \n13. \nHowever,  continued  efforts  are  needed  to  strengthen  investor  protection,  and  improve \nmarket transparency, corporate governance, and risk management capacity of market institutions. \nSubprogram 2 will support government efforts to limit the scope of unregulated markets for unlisted \nsecurities15 to encourage companies to increase their long-term capital and financing needs in the \nregulated capital markets. \n \n14. \nGovernment  debt  market.  The  bond  market  has  been  impacted  by  the  global  financial \ncrisis.  Total  outstanding  value  of  government  bonds  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  increased  from \n2.82% in 2001 to 8.16% in 2005, reaching its peak in 2007 at 10.28% before declining to 9.49% in \n2008  and  8.25%  in  2009.  The  debt  market  is  largely  dominated  by  government  obligations.  The \nmost significant issue preventing the development of the bond market, other than lack of significant \nparticipants,  is  the  lack  of  reliable  and  liquid  benchmarks  to  establish  a  government  yield  curve. \nThe government public debt profile is currently skewed toward the short end of the yield curve16 ; \nlonger-term  issuance  needs  to  be  considered  in  establishing  the  needed  benchmarks.  The \n                                                 \n14  IMF  Executive  Board  Concludes  2010  Article  IV  Consultation  with  Vietnam  Public  Information  Notice  No.  10/127,  8 \n\nSeptember 2010. \n\n15 Private equity markets. \n16 These include those with yields ranging from 3 months to 12 months. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nestablishment of the Debt Management and External Finance Office (PDMO)17 with the passing of \nthe  Public  Debt  Management  Law  on  17  June  2009  is  expected  to  significantly  help  address \nimpediments to consolidating the management of public debt. The government has also embarked \non  a  comprehensive  review  of  Decree  141/2003/ND-CP,  which  governs  the  issuance  of \ngovernment  bonds,  government-guaranteed  bonds,  and  municipal  bonds,  and  Decree \n52/2006/ND-CP, which regulates the issuance of corporate bonds.   \n \n15. \nSupport  for  the  insurance  industry.  The  development  of  long-term  savings  institutions \nsuch  as  the  insurance  subsector  is  critical  for  mobilizing  and  allocating  long-term  savings  into \ncapital to further the economic development of the country. The insurance subsector continues to \nexpand  rapidly  with  annual  insurance  premiums  growing  tenfold  over  the  past  10  years,  to \napproximately  $1.2  billion.  Nevertheless,  only  about  5%  of  Viet  Nam's  population  is insured.  The \ngovernment  recently  amended  the  Law  on  Insurance  Business  to  provide  greater  investor \nprotection, and the Insurance Supervisory Authority has strengthened its capacity to protect policy \nholders. However, more emphasis needs to be given to capacity building of the insurance regulator \nto enhance the risk-based supervision framework to bring it into alignment with international best \npractice. \n \n16.  Market information and transparency. Viet Nam faces significant challenges in effectively \nadopting international accounting standards (IAS) and auditing standards. Given the complexity of \nthe standards, the government has decided to initiate step-by-step implementation after completing \ncomprehensive  and  thorough  consultation  and  preparation.  Further  support  is  needed  for  the  full \nadoption of IAS and auditing standards, including capacity building.  \n \nGlobal  financial  crisis  and  lessons  learned.  Progress  on  some  of  the  indicative  policy \n17. \nactions  developed  for  subprogram  2  in  2006  has  been  difficult.  First,  the  global  financial  crisis \nresulted in a change in the government\u2019s priorities for the financial sector, as was the case for Viet \nNam\u2019s  regional  peers.  For  example,  total  stock  market  capitalization  as  a  percentage  of  GDP \nreached its peak at 43.26% in 2007 before declining to 15.19% in 2008. Likewise, total outstanding \nvalue of Government bond as a percentage of GDP reached its peak in 2007 at 10.28% of GDP \nbefore declining to 8.25% in 2009. Second, the government is increasingly recognizing the need to \ncreate an institutional basis for its debt management. Third, focus is needed on development of the \nshort  end  of  the  government  securities  market  and  augmented  money  markets  (footnote  16).  To \nsupport the government in meeting its revised priorities, subprogram 2  was refined based on the \nfollowing four key considerations: \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nShift  in  priorities. The reformulation recognizes the significant shift in government \npolicy  priorities  for  the  financial  sector  following  the  global  financial  crisis\u2014notably \nstrengthened  emphasis  on  key  reforms  to  enhance  the  transparency,  soundness, \nand stability of banking system. \nNeed  to  create  an  institutional  basis  for  debt  management.  While  the  global \nfinancial crisis presented unexpected challenges for the development of government \nbond  markets,  it  also  led  to  the  recognition  that  existing  arrangements  for  debt \nissuance  pose  significant  impediments.  The  government  recognizes  the  need  to \ncreate  an  institutional  basis  for  holistic  reforms  of  its  debt  operations  prior  to \nembarking on significant market structure reforms.  \nDevelopment  of  the  short  end  of  the  government  securities  market  and \naugmented  money  markets.  The  refined  program  prioritizes  the  development  of \nthe short end of the bond market as part of a sequential approach to bond market \n\n                                                 \n17  The  abbreviation  \"PDMO\u201d  which  is  commonly  used  for  Public  Debt  Management  Office  is  used  for  the  Debt     \n\nManagement and External Finance Office. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\ndevelopment.  Subprogram  2  will  support  the  government  in  improving  the  risk \nmanagement  and  operating  efficiency  of  money  markets  and  open  market \noperations of SBV to enhance liquidity in the secondary market. \nLessons  from  subprogram  2.18 Finance  sector  reforms  in  transitional  economies \noften  recognize  the  need  for  a  clearly  defined  step-by-step  approach  over  the \nmedium-to-long  term  as  new  institutions  and  concepts  need  to  be  introduced  and \nrelated capacity built.  \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe  expected  impact  for  the  program  is  a  more  diversified,  deeper,  and  resilient  financial \nsector in Viet Nam. The outcome of the program will be an increased share of capital markets in \nfinancing domestic investment, which will promote and facilitate a sustained high growth rate in the \neconomy with reduced refunding risks.19 \n \nC. \n \n19. \nSubprogram  2  acknowledges  the  difficult  environment  faced  by  Viet  Nam  in  the  wake  of \nglobal financial crisis during 2008\u20132009, and recognizes significant key measures initiated by SBV \nin  2009\u20132010  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  the  crisis  on  the  financial  sector  to  ensure  financial \nstability.  While  progress  on  some  of  the  indicative  policy  actions  developed  for  subprogram  2 \nduring formulation of subprogram 1 in 2006 was difficult due to the fallout from the global financial \ncrisis, significant progress in related areas has been achieved in response to the crisis to assure \nthe  soundness  of  commercial  banks.  Additionally,  in  other  policy  areas  where  program  progress \nhas fallen behind due to the impacts from the global financial crisis, new institutional approaches, \nsuch  as  the  formation  of  PDMO,  provide  a  basis  for  sounder  and  accelerated  progress  in \nimplementing  needed  reforms  for  government  debt.  Although  the  direct  impact  of  the  crisis  on \naccounting is not discernible, the original condition imposed for subprogram 2 on implementation of \nIAS  39  was  refined  due  to  market  readiness  issues  for  adopting  this  standard  by  2010.  Other \nsignificant  progress  includes  major  law  reforms  initiated  across  the  financial  sector\u2014banking, \nsecurities,  and \nlong-term  capital  markets \ndevelopment; new disclosure requirements; various micro-prudential measures introduced by SBV; \nand related measures to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory regime. \n \n20. \ninformation \ndisclosure.

Under  a  new  core  policy  action,  SSC  completed  a \ncomprehensive analysis of a strategic development and sector road map for 2010\u20132020 to address \nmarket infrastructure bottlenecks for capital market growth. To address accounting standards, the \ngovernment  initiated  a  gap  assessment  to  more  closely  align  Vietnamese  accounting  standards \nwith the IAS and developed an implementation timeline. \n \n\ninvestor  confidence  and  supporting  market \n\nOutput  1:  Enhanced  capital  market \n\nthe  SSC  Strategy  2010\u20132020 \n\ninsurance; \n\nimproved \n\nliquidity \n\nthrough \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.  2010.

To  enhance  information  disclosure,  the  Vietnam  Securities \nDepository (VSD) completed the pilot implementation of the automatic synchronization of records \nbetween  its  head  office  and  branches  for  public  companies  registered  with  VSD.  To  strengthen \nVSD\u2019s risk management capacity, a risk assessment of its central depository and clearing functions \nbenchmarked against international practices will be undertaken.20 \n \n22. \nOutput  2:  Strengthened  institutional  framework  for  securities  issuance.  To  develop \nthe  government  securities  market,  the  program  supports  institutional  reforms  such  as  the \nestablishment of PDMO. Together with the Banking and Financial Institutions Department of MOF, \nPDMO  will  provide  an  institutional  focal  point  to  support  a  range  of  key  reforms  in  the  bond \nmarkets. To improve the risk management and operating efficiency of the money market, and open \nmarket  operations  for  the  development  of  a  liquid  secondary  market,  SBV  will  incorporate  the \nshort-term risk mitigation measures identified in the ADB TA report.21   \n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  investor  and  consumer \nprotection and financial sector stability. The program supports a review of the legal framework \nfor  the  Securities  Law  with  a  view  to  strengthening  enforcement  powers  and  investor  protection. \nSBV,  as  part  of  its  response  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  introduced  measures  to  strengthen \ncommercial  banks  including  (i)  adopting  new  corporate  governance  requirements  based  on  the \ncorporate governance principles of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; \n(ii) increasing the charter capital of banks; and (iii) amending the SBV Law, Credit Institutions Law, \nand  application  of  Bankruptcy  Law  on  credit  institutions,  including  special  control  by  SBV  in  an \neffort to drive banking consolidation. \n \n24. \nAs  part  of  its  efforts  to  strengthen  its  anti-money  laundering  regime,  Viet  Nam  joined  the \nAsia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and in July 2009 was evaluated by the group. A new core \npolicy  action  supported  under  subprogram  2  is  the  submission  of  the  draft  amendments  to  the \ninsurance law to the government by August 2010 and the issuance of a decree on administrative \npenalties for insurance businesses. \n \n25. \nOutput  4:  Improved  regional  cooperation  and  human  resource  development. One of \nthe conditions stipulated in subprogram 1 is for SSC to assess its ability to meet benchmarks under \nthe  International  Organization  of  Securities  Regulators  (IOSCO)  multilateral  memorandum  of \nunderstanding (MMOU) and to develop a road map for it to become a signatory to Annex B of the \nIOSCO  MMOU.  Viet  Nam  has  been  accepted  as  an  IOSCO  MMOU  Annex  B  signatory;  this  is \nsubject to government approval. The reformulated policy action for subprogram 2 requires MOF to \nsubmit  a  request  to  the  government  to  approve  Viet  Nam\u2019s  membership  in  the  MMOU  Annex  B \nsignatory.  Subprogram  2  supports  a  systematic  approach  to  capacity  building  for  financial  sector \ndevelopment. SBV is developing a 5-year human resource development plan to 2015 with a vision \nup  to  2020.

The PPPF is outlined in the policy matrix (Appendix \n4).  \n \nD. \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  SDR38,271,000  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s \n27. \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2.  The  loan  will  have  an  interest  charge  at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement. The government will use \nthe  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program \nexpenditures and associated costs of reform and to help maintain current social expenditures. \n \n28.      ADB  funds  will  support  reforms  outlined  in  the  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  3)  and \npolicy  matrix  and  post-program  partnership  framework  (Appendix  4).  The  overall  loan  size  is \ndetermined  by  the  strength  of  the  associated  policy  actions,  their  development  impact,  the \nimportance  of  the  sectors  covered,  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  government  as \nindicated by MOF, and the government\u2019s financing needs during the country partnership strategy \nperiod.  The  program  will  imply  some  short-term,  direct  adjustment  costs,  including  costs  for  (i) \nrestructuring  and  capacity  building  for  SSC,  SBV,  MOF,  and  capital  markets  self-regulatory \norganizations;  (ii)  operationalizing  new  institutions  including  capacity  building  (e.g.,  PDMO);  (iii) \nenhancing  supervisory  agencies,  and  accounting  and  auditing  agencies;  (iv)  introducing  new \nstandards and legislative reforms; and (v) developing money markets and open market operations, \nand  developing  bond  markets.  It  is  estimated  that  total  short  to  medium  term  static  gains  under \nFSPL III from (i) improvement in banking sector efficiency, (ii) shift financing mix from bank loans to \nbonds,  and  (iii)  reduce  corporate  default  rates  to  benchmark  rates,  is  at  $489  million  or  0.6%  of \nGDP. A long-term static gain from the reforms is estimated at $4.8 billion or 5.5% of GDP. A total \nestimated  adjustment  cost  from  the  program  is  about  $56.8  million.23 The  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans. 24  The  program  will  provide  for  the  retroactive \nfinancing  of  eligible  expenditures  incurred  up  to  180  days  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  ADB  will \nretain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the withdrawal \napplication  certification.  The  short-term,  direct  costs,  however,  do  not  incorporate  the  full  direct \ncosts of the policy package, which includes longer-term changes for institutions and processes.25 \nWhile  the  direct  reform  costs  maybe  relatively  modest,  the  program  is  expected  to  leverage \nsubstantial  increase  in  the  availability  and  access  to  finance  through  enhanced  capital  markets \nliquidity and strengthened legal and institutional framework.  \n \n29. \nThe  program  loan  also  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  government.  The \npolitical costs of implementing the reforms are considerable, with vested interests benefiting from \nweak  enforcement  of  regulations  in  financial  markets  and  from  the  absence  of  adequate  risk \nmanagement, supervision, and transparency. Although the benefits of the reforms will far outweigh \nthe costs, the benefits will materialize over time, while the costs are front loaded. In the absence of \ntimely reforms, the economy will continue to bear the significant costs of inefficient intermediation \nand  be  exposed  to  systemic  risks,  perhaps  most  importantly  currency  and  maturity  mismatches, \n\n                                                 \n23 The Summary Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides details of the \nmagnitude  of  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  program.  Total  estimated  adjustment  costs  of  $56.8  million  include \nadministrative, enforcement, fiscal and business compliance costs. \n\n24 ADB. 1998.

SBV  is \nresponsible for overall program implementation and administration, disbursement of loan proceeds, \nand monitoring.  \n \n32. \nTo  coordinate  program  implementation  among  different  government  ministries  and \nagencies concerned, a program steering committee was formed, chaired by SBV and comprising \nsenior officers from all government agencies concerned. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nFiduciary Assessment \n\n33. \nThe  government\u2019s  public  financial  management  reforms  are  at  an  early  stage  but  steady \nprogress  is  being  made  in  improving  the  legislative  and  institutional  framework.  The  National \nAssembly  promulgated  the  Law  on  Public  Debt  Management  in  June  2009.  The  law  provides  a \nlegal framework for a modern debt management system to monitor public debt, analyze its profile, \nand resolve and manage related fiscal risks.  \n \n34. \nImplementation  of  the  2002  Budget  Law  is  progressing.  Budget  coverage  in  Viet  Nam  is \nreasonably  comprehensive,  but  still  incomplete  compared  to  international  practices.  The  State \nBudget  Law  needs  to  be  updated.  The  Government  has  piloted  a  medium-term  expenditure \nframework in several sectors, but it needs to be scaled up and mainstreamed in the annual budget \ncycle. The World Bank\u2019s assessment suggests that the fiduciary risks of the current public financial \nmanagement systems (budgeting, accounting, reporting and auditing) are moderate.26 \n \nA  new  integrated  computerized  financial  management  system  (Treasury  and  Budget \n35. \nManagement Information System) was rolled out in 2008 to strengthen expenditure management \nand  control.  A  road  map  for  adoption  of  international  public  sector  accounting  standards  was \napproved to provide the basis for preparing government financial statements that are more in line \nwith international practices.  \n \n36. \nThe  government  is  also  developing  the  building  blocks  for  improved  governance  and \nanticorruption measures. Since 2005, implementation of the State Audit Law and reporting of the \nsummaries of annual audit reports by the State Audit of Vietnam have strengthened the process of \nexternal  oversight.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  and  discussed  with  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  executing  agency.  The \ngovernment  is  taking  an  active  approach  against  corruption,  and  recently  adopted  several  legal \nchanges, including the Anti-Corruption Law. Results of investigations against corruption overseen \nby the government inspectorate have been disclosed, and a legal framework established to protect \nand reward people who speak out against corruption.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Social Impact Assessment \n\nThe financial sector plays a central role in the mobilization and allocation of resources in a \n38. \nmodern  market-based  economy.  Reforms  supported  under  this  and  earlier  programs  have  been \nintegral to supporting Viet Nam's gradual transition to a market-based economy and to helping the \ngovernment  achieves  and  sustains  high  rates  of  economic  growth.  These,  in  turn,  have  been \ninstrumental  in  the  country's  remarkable  progress  in  poverty  reduction  over  the  last  decade.  The \noverall poverty rate dropped from 58% in 1993 to about 14.8% in 2008. According to government \nprojections, the current poverty rate is below 10%. The impressive reduction in poverty is largely \nattributable  to  sustained  business-led  growth  in  investment,  output,  and  employment  that  have \nbeen made possible partly by the financial sector reform programs. The private sector has created \nmost of the new jobs in the last decade. The majority of private sector investment has come from \ndomestic enterprises. The program's focus underscores the priority placed by the government in its \nnational socioeconomic development plans and sector strategies on financial sector development.  \n \nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  rated  as  category  C  for \n\n39. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40. \nSubprogram  2  assumes  political  stability  in  the  country  and  continued  adoption  of  sound \nmacroeconomic  policies  by  the  government.  Given  the  track  record  of  Viet  Nam,  both  these \nassumptions  are  sound  and  defensible.  Nonetheless,  implementation  of  subprogram  2  is  still \nsubject to the risks described in the following table.  \n \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \n\nExogenous, international \nfinancial shock, and \nmacroeconomic instability \nPolitical resistance and vested \ninterest may slow the reforms.  \n\nPoor governance and \ncorruption \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government is undertaking measures to strengthen its monetary policy framework, \nexpand the tax base, and strengthen public expenditure management, with the \nassistance of development partners including ADB.  \nThe government has shown strong commitment to the reform agenda.
