The  project  will \nrespond to the needs of urban communities (including low-income households) by constructing \nnew  separate  sewerage  systems  and  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs),  setting  up  local \nwastewater  infrastructure  management  institutions,  and  strengthening  the  relevant  regional \ngovernment departments.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIndonesia has one of the lowest coverage rates of conventional off-site urban sewerage \nin Asia. Only 11 out of its 330 cities have partial sewerage systems, and only 2% of the national \nurban population is connected to central WWTPs; the remaining urban population depends on \npoorly  constructed  and  maintained  septic  tanks  and  unlined  pit  latrines,  which  result  in \nleachates penetrating the aquifers. Some 80% of gray water drains directly to surface waters.2 \nThe present sanitation services are inadequate and unintegrated, due to inadequate and poorly \nenforced  regulations.  This  results  in  limited  desludging  of  septic  tanks,  inadequate  septage \ntreatment  facilities,  and  fragmented  operational  responsibility.3 Improved  access  to  safe  water \nand  basic  sanitation  is  part  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  effort  to  achieve  its  2015 \nMillennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  targets.4 While  the  government\u2019s  MDG  reports  suggest \nthat  good  progress  has  been  achieved  with  respect  to  sanitation,  in  practice  the  available \nfacilities are substandard, and rely on unsustainable septage removal and treatment facilities.5 \nAs  a  result,  there  is  significant  environmental  pollution,  widespread  contamination  of  surface \nand  groundwater  with  the  associated  spread  of  water-related  diseases, 6  and  high  infant \nmortality. 7  The  inadequate  sanitation  systems  and  their  resulting  environmental  and  health \nimpacts produce economic opportunity losses of about $5.6 billion annually, equivalent to 2.3% \nof the country\u2019s gross domestic product.8 These issues can be solved by the introduction of (i) \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   \u201cGray water\u201d is wastewater originating from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing. \n3   Septage refers to the liquid sludge removed from septic tanks that needs to be treated and disposed safely. \n4   Specifically,  75.3%  of  the  urban  population  has  sustainable  access  to  an  improved  water  supply  by  2015,  and \n\n76.8% of urban households have sustainable access to basic sanitation by 2015. \n\n5   Ministry of National Development Planning/National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2012.

The project\u2019s target areas are the most densely populated districts of five \n4. \ncities. Cimahi, located in the province of Central Java, has a population of 617,000 (2012). The \ncurrent  sanitation  facilities  in  Cimahi  are  limited  to  septic  tanks,  pit  latrines,  and  public  toilets. \nAbout  30%  of  the  population  lacks  access  to  any  sanitation  facility,  and  disposes  of  waste \ndirectly  to  open  drains  and  rivers.  Many  residents  suffer  from  waterborne  diseases.  Jambi, \nlocated  in  the  province  of  Central  Sumatra,  has  a  population  of  558,500  (2010);  6%  of  the \npopulation does not have a toilet. In general, wastewater is disposed through septic tanks from \nwhich polluted effluent is discharged into open drains or directly to the surrounding paddy fields. \nMakassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province, has a population of about 1.4 million (2011). \nSanitation  facilities  comprise  individual  septic  tanks,  three  small  bore  sewerage  systems  with \nsewage  treatment,  and  one  septage  treatment  plant.  Open  defecation  is  still  a  major  health \nproblem  in  the  Losari  area  of  Makassar.9 Palembang,  the  capital  of  South  Sumatra  province, \nhas a population of 1.47 million (2009); 69% of the population use septic tanks, about 4% use \npit  latrines,  and  the  remaining  27%  lack  access  to  basic  sanitation.  The  city  has  a  single \nseptage  treatment  facility.  Pekanbaru,  the  capital  of  Riau  province,  has  a  population  of  1.29 \nmillion (2012). There is neither a centralized sewerage system nor communal septic tanks in the \ncity, and most residents rely on individual pit latrines and septic tanks. Open defecation is widely \npracticed.  \n \n5. \nSector  issues.  A  central  government  assessment  summarizes  the  urban  sanitation \nsector  in  Indonesia  as  lacking  an  adequate  regulatory  framework,  suffering  from  fragmented \ninstitutional  involvement,  lacking  local  government  resources  to  provide  public  services,  and \nlacking  community  awareness  of  sanitation  issues.  10 Although  the  responsibility  for  supplying \nand  managing  improved  sanitation  has  been  devolved  to  local  governments,  their  capacity  to \nensure  that  the  necessary  systems  are  in  place  and  operating  effectively  is  limited.  ADB  is \ncurrently implementing the Metropolitan Sanitation Management and Health Project (MSMHP), \nwhich  finances  urban  sanitation  in  Medan  and  Yogyakarta  cities,  and  is  complemented  by \ncapacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  institutions. 11 To  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s plan for sanitation, the project will continue the MSMHP work with new sewerage \nsystem developments in cities that lack sewerage systems.  \n \n6. \nRelated policies and strategies. The proposed project supports (i) the implementation \nof the government's Road Map for Acceleration of Urban Sanitation Development, 2010\u20132014, \nwhich  targets  sewerage  systems  in  16  cities  and  the  implementation  of  community-based \nsanitation  in  all  other  cities;  (ii)  the  ADB\u2019s Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Assessment;12 \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  which  aims  to  improve  wastewater  treatment \nand  management  in  developing  member  countries;13 and  (iv)  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan, \n2012\u20132020  to  promote  environmentally  sustainable  green  cities.14 In  particular,  the  project  will \n                                                \n9   Losari has a population of 214,000 (2009). \n10  Ministry of National Development Planning/National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2010.

This  will  be  the \nsecond  wastewater  project  under  the  Government's  Roadmap  to  Acceleration  of  Urban \nSanitation Development, after the MSMHP. ADB is a key agency supporting this initiative. \n \n8. \nLessons.  A  review  of  the  outcome  of  urban  sanitation  projects  in  Indonesia  indicates \nthat  local  ownership  is  fundamental  to  sustainability.  Facilities  provided  by  the  central \ngovernment  without  local  involvement  are  mismanaged,  ineffective  or  abandoned  over  time. \nLocal  governments  will  be  represented  in  this  project\u2019s  implementation  unit  (PIU),  and  fully \nparticipate  in  project  procurement  and  management  to  ensure  strong  project  ownership. \nLessons  from  the  implementation  of  the  MSMHP  and  other  urban  projects  will  be  taken  into \naccount, specifically experience from procurement activities and the benefits of micro-marketing \ntechniques to raise public awareness regarding the importance of good sanitation.  \n \n9. \nSpecial  features.  The  project  will  pursue  improved  planning  and  implementation  of \nsewerage  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  with  cofinancing  from  the  ASEAN  Infrastructure \nFund,16 and  collaborative  cofinancing  from  the  Government  of  Australia.17 The  project  will  be \nsupported  by  TA  for  the  creation  of  autonomous  institutions,  within  local  authorities,  through \ncapacity  development,  the  implementation  of  regulations  governing  the  sewerage  service \ndelivery, and awareness-raising of the importance of good sanitation practices and the benefits \nof public sewerage systems.18  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe impact of the project will be the reduced pollutant discharges to the environment in \nthe  participating  cities  (Cimahi,  Jambi,  Makassar,  Palembang,  and  Pekanbaru).  The  outcome \nwill  be  the  increased  connection  of  the  population  to  improved  wastewater  services  in  the \nparticipating cities. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe project will have two outputs:  \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2012.

Output 1 will construct 66 kilometers (km) of trunk and main sewers, \n83,200  sewer  connections,19 and  five  WWTPs  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of \n83,000 cubic meters per day (m3/d), and with provision for future expansion.20 At \nleast  10%  of  the  connections  (and  associated  service  charges)\u2014for  poor \nhouseholds,  households  headed  by  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups\u2014will \nbe  subsidized,  and  64  community-based  sanitation  systems  will  be  installed  in \nnon-sewered  areas  serving  low-income  families.  These  systems  will  be  directly \nfunded by local government budgets. \n \nOutput  2:  Project  implementation  support  institutionalized.  The  capacity  of \nthe executing and implementing agencies will be strengthened through provision \nof  management  support  and  training  in  (i)  procurement  and  construction \nsupervision;  and  (ii)  design  and  commissioning  of  sewerage  systems.  TA  for \ninstitutional  development  and  management  and  capacity  building  support  for \nsustainability  will  be  implemented  separately  (footnote  18).  This  will  include \ndevelopment  by  the  government  of  public  sanitation  awareness  campaigns  that \nseek  to  build  appreciation  and  understanding  of  the  benefits  of  sewerage \nsystems  and  the  need  for  adequate  charges  to  ensure  that  they  remain  fully \noperational and correctly maintained. \n \n\nD. \n \n12. \n \n\nItem \nA.

A  new WWTP  will  be  constructed  in  each city  designed to meet \nthe government\u2019s effluent water quality standards.24 The technologies selected for the WWTPs \nare a mixture of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors and aerated lagoons, which are easy \nto  operate  and  have  low  maintenance  costs.  Adequate  land  for  the  Jambi  and  Makassar \nWWTPs  has  been  acquired,  and  further  land  acquisition  is  being  carried  out  for  Cimahi, \nPalembang,  and  Pekanbaru.  Flood  risk  assessments  will  ensure  that  the  designs  provide \nadequate protection against fluvial flooding. Engineering designs will be based on internationally \naccepted standards with due consideration given to local conditions. A total of 10 construction \ncontract  packages  will  be  awarded\u2014nine  through  international  competitive  bidding,  and  one \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding.  The  project\u2019s  implementation  support  component  will \nprovide  technical  support  and  training  to  raise  local  understanding  of  the  O&M  of  wastewater \nservices and septage solids treatment. The expected project benefits will include (i) reduction in \npollutant discharges to the environment which will improve groundwater and river water quality; \n(ii)  improved  public  health  due  to  reduced  exposure  to  untreated  wastewater  and  gray  water \n                                                \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  WWTP effluent standards are set by the Ministry of Environment.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\nflows  and  reduced  pathogen  counts  in  groundwater  and  river  water;  (iii) improved  institutional \ncapability and governance through strengthening of organizational structures and training; and \n(iv) increased community participation and empowerment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  feasibility 25 of  the  subprojects  was  evaluated,  based  on  the  following \n18. \nbenefits:  (i) health  impact  in  terms  of  health  care  costs  and  productivity  savings;  (ii)  economic \nopportunity loss; (iii) obviated costs of constructing and desludging septic tanks; (iv) willingness \nto  pay  for  sewerage  management  services;  and  (v)  increased  economic  opportunities, \nemployment  creation,  and  poverty  reduction  as  a  result  of  the  cities\u2019  improved  livability  and \nattractiveness  to  businesses.  Under  the  anticipated  project  best-case  scenario,  all  five \nsubprojects are economically feasible, with economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) above the \nminimum  12.0%  threshold.  Sensitivity  tests  show  that  all  subprojects  remain  economically \nfeasible given a (i) 10% increase in investment cost, (ii) 10.0% increase in O&M cost, or (iii) a \n10.0%  reduction  in  total  benefits.  A  1-year  delay  in  economic  benefits  for  Jambi  reduces  its \nEIRR  to  slightly  below  the  benchmark.  Under  a  worst-case  scenario  (a  simultaneous  10% \nincrease in investment and O&M costs, combined with a 10.0% reduction in total benefits), the \nEIRRs  for  the  Cimahi  and  Palembang  subprojects  fall  slightly  below  the  12.0%  threshold;  the \nEIRR for Pekanbaru drops to 10.9%, and for Jambi to 10.7%. All subprojects are very sensitive \nto reductions in total benefits, followed closely by increased investment. \n \nThe financial analysis26 addresses the: (i) financial viability of the proposed subprojects; \n19. \n(ii) affordability of proposed wastewater fees; and (iii) sustainability of the proposed subprojects \nand  availability  of  a  subsidy  from  the  respective  city  governments,  where  necessary. 27 The \nCimahi, Jambi, Makassar, and Pekanbaru subprojects will be funded by debt undertaken by the \ncentral government, with the assets subsequently transferred to the cities. These four cities will \ncommit  to  implementing  tariffs  (which  will  apply  to  all  connected  households  and  commercial \nestablishments) as soon as the systems are completely operational, to ensure the recovery of \nO&M costs through collection of wastewater fees. In most cases, the tariffs necessary to cover \nO&M  costs  were  below  the  respondents\u2019  willingness  to  pay.  For  all  five  cities,  the  proposed \nwastewater  fees  are  about  0.15%\u20131.0%  of  average  household  income,  below  the  2.0% \naffordability threshold.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  MPW  has  implemented  several  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  funded  by \n20. \nmultilateral  institutions,  which  has  given  them  experience  in  financial  management,  fund \ndisbursement,  and  procurement  of  civil  works  and  consultancy  services.  The  capacity \ndevelopment TA will help strengthen the capacity of the PIU and project management unit staff \nin each city to carry out project-related tasks.  \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MPW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 23). \n \n\n                                                \n25  Economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 A subsidy will be required in Cimahi and Pekanbaru for the first 2 years. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\n22. \nThe project is classified as an MDG-targeted intervention. The project will have positive \nsocial  impacts  through  reduction  of  the  high  incidence  of  water-related  diseases,  and  will \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  in  urban  communities.  It  promotes  inclusive  development  through \nsubsidies  for  the  domestic  connections  and  monthly  wastewater  fees  of  poor  households, \nhouseholds headed by women, as well as the sick and disabled. Measures will be taken to help \nexpand  sewerage  connections  and  sustain  behavioral  change  through  joint  stakeholder \nplanning on hygiene and environmental management.  \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  benefit  women  by \nimplementing  a  gender  action  plan 28 (30%  of  capacity  building  recipients  at  community  and \ninstitutional  levels  will  be  women);  similar  quotas  are  set  for  consultations  and  in  sanitation \npromotion, as well as in job opportunities in sanitation management through female recruitment. \nA  national  gender  and  social  development  specialist  will  support  the  PIUs  to  ensure  that  the \ngender action plan is fully implemented.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards  \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Resettlement  plans29 have  been  prepared  for \n24. \neach  of  the  subprojects  (Cimahi,  Palembang,  and  Pekanbaru)  that  involve  land  acquisition;  a \ntotal  of  32.397  hectares  will  be  acquired,  with  63  households  (240  persons)  affected.  The \nPekanbaru  subproject  will  have  significant  impacts,  with  22  households  (97  persons)  losing \nmore  than  10%  of  their  productive  land.  Palembang  will  have  24  households  (75  persons) \nrequiring  relocation.  Due  diligence  reports  for  Jambi  and  Makassar  have  been  prepared,  and \nland  acquisition  for  these  subprojects  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nprevailing  local  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  no \ncorrective action plans or resettlement plans are considered necessary for Jambi and Makassar. \nAll other impacts are partial and temporary. The total land acquisition and resettlement cost is \nestimated at $9.502 million (including base costs, allowances, and contingencies). A cutoff date \nwas established with stakeholder consultations.30 Information was disclosed to affected persons \nthroughout project preparation, with a public information booklet distributed in February 2013. \n \n25. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  No  indigenous  peoples  will  be  affected  by  the \nsubprojects.  Land  to  be  acquired  is  not  part  of  any  ancestral  domain.  Field  investigations \nconducted in the project area failed to reveal the existence of any indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminorities.  \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examinations 31  were  conducted  in \n26. \naccordance  with \nthe  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  regulations. \nStakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  from  May  to  November  2012.  Issues  raised  during \nthe  consultation  are  addressed  in  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  Subprojects \nwill  not  cause  irreversible  environmental  impacts.  The  EMPs  include  mitigation  measures  and \ncost estimates for their implementation.  The EMPs will be updated at the detailed design stage; \nonce approved by ADB, they will form part of the contract bidding documents. Implementation of \nthe  EMPs  will  be  enforced  by  an  environment  officer  in  the  local  project  management  unit.

Adverse impacts during operation \nwill be minimized by specified O&M procedures and environmental monitoring.  \n \nIn  compliance  with  the  Environmental  Protection  and  Management  Law,  2009,  an \n27. \nAnalisis  Mengenai  Dampak  Lingkungan  (environmental  impact  assessment  [AMDAL])\u2014will  be \nprepared  by  the  detailed  engineering  design  consultant  for  each  subproject.    AMDALs  will  be \nfunded by the Government of Australia through the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative in Cimahi, \nMakassar, and Palembang at the detailed engineering design stage and by local governments \nin  Jambi  and  Pekanbaru  after  detailed  engineering  design.  The  government  environmental \npermits and approvals for construction will be obtained before the award of civil works contracts.  \n \nDisclosure.  Resettlement  and  environment  documents  were  prepared  in  consultation \n28. \nwith  local  communities  and  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nIndonesian laws and regulations. The documents have been endorsed, approved and posted on \nthe ADB website. A grievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints \nregarding project performance. The resettlement plans, initial environmental examinations, and \nEMPs will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and cleared by ADB prior to contract \nawards.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n29.
