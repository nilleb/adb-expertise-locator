Summary  Initial  Environmental  Examination  is  in \nAssessment  Supplementary Appendix B. \n   \nProject Description  The  Restructuring  of  the  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining  System  Project  (Project)  will  help  the  Department  of \nEducation  and  the  Department  of  Labor  and  Manpower  in \nBalochistan  Province  in  Pakistan  to  reform  the  technical \neducation  and  vocational  training  (TEVT)  system  covering \npostsecondary technician education at the polytechnic level, mid-\nlevel technical and vocational training for students after grade 8, \nand  livelihood  training  for  out-of-school  youth  and  women.  It \ncomprises  three  components:  (i)  institutional  development,  (ii) \nimprovement of quality and relevance of TEVT, and (iii) access \nand equity enhancement. The Project will focus on (i) improving \nthe capacity of TEVT  institutions to be more competitive and \nresponsive to labor market needs by emphasizing public-private \npartnerships, on-the-job training, and counseling services for job \nplacements; and (ii) introducing performance-based management \nand  management  development  programs  for  more  efficient \ndelivery of TEVT programs. The relevancy and quality of TEVT \nprograms will be improved through competency-based training, \nteacher  training,  provision  of  learning  resources,  and  quality \ncontrol. The Project will support rural poor and women through \nnew programs and facilities, livelihood training for rural areas, \nand  entrepreneurship  training  and  support  for  access  to \nmicrocredit for self-employment. \n   \nRationale  Balochistan  needs  to  increase  investment  in  education  and \ntraining. The total literacy rate for both sexes of 36.0% (53.0% for \nmales and 15.0% for females) is the lowest among all provinces \nin  the  country,  with  a  wide  disparity  between  genders  and \nbetween rural (30.0%) and urban (70.0%) areas. Poverty may be \nas high as 41.3% compared with the national rate of 32.1%. To \nreduce  poverty,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  is  working  to \ndevelop skilled workers and generate employment especially in \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  using  indigenous  natural \nresources. While the province has a high unemployment rate, \nexisting job opportunities often are unfilled due to lack of trained \npersonnel. International employment opportunities are increasing \nfor skilled workers, especially in middle eastern countries and \nMalaysia.  To  prepare  workers  for  both  these  environments \nimprovements of the internal and external efficiency of the TEVT \nsystem  are  urgently  needed.  Efforts  to  consolidate  and \nstrengthen TEVT programs and additional investments to make ", "  iii\nthe  TEVT  system  more  responsive  and  competitive  will  help \nimprove  the  prospects  of  TEVT  trainees  when  they  seek \nemployment or self-employment.  \n   \nObjectives   The Project\u2019s goal is to contribute to the Government\u2019s overall \npoverty  reduction  strategy  by  enhancing  competitiveness  of \nTEVT and employability of its graduates in line with emerging \nmarket needs. Focusing on Balochistan, the Project\u2019s specific \nobjectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity,  efficiency,  and  autonomy  of  TEVT  institutions;  (ii) \nimprove  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs;  and  (iii) \nenhance access and equity to better quality TEVT, particularly for \nrural poor and women. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Department  of  Education  and \nDepartment of Labor and Manpower in provincial government of \nBalochistan (PGB) to restructure their organizational setup, and \nstrengthen institutional capacity to provide better quality TEVT \nprograms  that  are  relevant  and  responsive  to  the  needs  of \nindustries. The Project will support TEVT institutions to improve \ntheir  planning  and  management  through  greater  autonomy  to \nprovide  higher  quality  and  more  relevant  TEVT  programs. \nProviding  training  for  teachers  and,  more  relevant  learning \nresources, introducing competency-based training, and improving \nquality  control  will  increase  the  quality  of  TEVT  programs. \nSupport to new facilities and new TEVT programs, and provision \nof livelihood training programs will provide better access to TEVT \nprograms for the rural poor and women. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $22.9 million equivalent, of which \n$5.4 million (23%) is the foreign exchange cost and $17.5 million \nequivalent (77%) is the local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent)\n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  Percent\nGovernment  0.0    6.6     6.6  29 \nStakeholders  0.0    0.3  0.3  1 \nADB  5.4    10.6  16.0   70 \n  Total  5.4    17.5  22.9  100 \n     ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $16 million equivalent from the Asian Development \nFund of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided.

Each will have a \nproject  management  unit  responsible  for  day-to-day  planning, \nmanagement, and implementation of project activities. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Planning and Development Department, PGB \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil \nworks  will  be  carried  out  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Each  civil  works  contract  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of more than $1,000,000, and each supply contract for \nequipment and materials estimated to cost the equivalent of more \nthan  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  Each  supply  contract  for  equipment  or \nmaterials estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will \nbe awarded on the basis of international shopping. Equipment \nand textbooks estimated to cost, in aggregate, the equivalent of \nless  than  $100,000  may  be  directly  procured.  Civil  works \ncontracts equivalent to $1,000,000 or less may be awarded on \nthe basis of local competitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 77 person-months of consulting services (18 person-\nmonths of international and 59 person-months of domestic) will \nbe utilized following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement \nof domestic consultants. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged individually or as a firm. A higher education institution \nand/or management institute will be selected and engaged for the \nmanagement  development  program,  performance-based \nmanagement,  and  development  of  the  competency-based \ntraining system. The quality- and cost-based selection method \nwill be applied for the selection and engagement of consulting \nfirms.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The direct beneficiaries of the Project will include about 10,000 \nBeneficiaries  students in four polytechnics (two existing and two new) and \nabout 10,000 students in 14 training centers (11 existing and 3 \nnew  for  women);  more  than  150  teachers  and  principals  in \npolytechnics, and about 600 teachers and principals in training \ncenters; about 250 institute management committee (IMC) and \ncenter management committee (CMC) members; and more than \n20,000  out  of  school  youth  and  adults  in  livelihood  training \nprograms.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  enrollment  will  be \ngenerated  by  the  new  polytechnics,  training  centers,  and \nlivelihood  training  programs.  By  supporting  qualitative \nimprovements in the curriculum, teaching and learning methods, \nand resources, the Project will benefit many students enrolled in \nTEVT  system  across  the  province.  Of  the  total  beneficiaries, \napproximately  25%  will  be  women,  75%  will  come  from  rural \nareas, and 40% will be from economically poor families. \n ", "  v\n  In rural areas, the Project will expand and improve the quality of \nTEVT educational opportunities of livelihood programs for out-of-\nschool  youth  and  adults  who  want  to  acquire  skills  for \nemployment or to start their own businesses. Nongovernment \norganizations will plan and implement the livelihood programs. \nInnovative features such as identification of training needs and \ntrades for self-employment will help meet local needs as well as \nthose of the outside market. Credit facilitation support will allow \nTEVT  graduates  to  access  microcredit  facilities  to  start  small \nbusinesses and help generate income and employment in the \ncommunities. All these measures will help reduce poverty in the \nprovince especially in rural areas where educational opportunities \nare still very limited. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  faces  four  possible  risks:  financial,  institutional, \npolicy, and economic. Firstly, the Government\u2019s effort to expand \nTEVT  without  adequate  focus  on  consolidating  and  ensuring \neffective services at the existing training institutes could erode \nthe financial and technical base needed to sustain the effective \noperation of these institutions. The Project supports measures to \nstrengthen the capacity and autonomy of TEVT institutions and \nseeks  PGB\u2019s  assurances  for  adequate  recurrent  budgets  and \nautonomy of TEVT institutions to enable them to manage their \nfinancial resources based on the needs. \n \nSecondly,  TEVT  institutions  lack  autonomy  and  effective \nleadership  to  make  them  responsive  to  labor  market  needs. \nWhile most TEVT institutions have IMCs or CMCs depending on \nthe type of institution, only a few of these committees are active \nlargely because of their poor governance structure, weak role of \nprincipals,  and  lack  of  time  among  IMC/CMC  members.  The \nProject  includes  a  management  development  program  and \nperformance-based  management  system  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity of principals, teachers, and staff of TEVT institutions. \n \n  Thirdly, while the federal policy on TEVT envisages substantial \nimprovement in the quality, management, and financing of TEVT \nprograms,  translating  this  into  action  is  not  possible  without \nlinking the performance of TEVT institutions with improvement \nplans,  targets,  and  policy  stipulations.  The  Project  aims  to \nincrease efficiency and effectiveness of TEVT institutions through \ninnovative measures such as quality assurance and accreditation \nsystems,  a  performance-based  management  system,  and \nexamination reform; and will seek PGB\u2019s assurances to align key \nTEVT policies at the provincial level. \n \n  Fourthly, the economy is not growing fast enough to absorb more \ngraduates from TEVT institutions. Related to this is the limited \ninvolvement of the private sector in TEVT institutions. The Project \nsupports much greater involvement of the private sector through \nIMCs, CMCs, production units, guidance counseling, and more \norganized labor market information. \n   ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Restructuring  of  the  Technical  Education  and \nVocational Training System Project (Balochistan). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s strong economic growth in the 1980s\u2014averaging 6.5%\u2014slowed considerably \nin 1990s to an average of 4.6%. Key social indicators, particularly for education, also stagnated, \ncomparing unfavorably with other countries at similar levels of development. However beginning \nin fiscal year (FY) 2003, the economy began to recover. The growth rate increased to 5.1%, and \nin FY2004 it is estimated at 6.4%. To achieve the significant poverty reduction targets in the \npoverty reduction strategy1 for Pakistan, the annual economic growth rate must be sustained \nabove 6%, particularly because population growth remains high. \n \n3.  The provincial government of Balochistan (PGB) faces dual problems of low educational \nattainment and high incidence of poverty among its population. The total literacy rate of those \n10 years of age and above is 36.0% (53.0% for males and 15.0% for females), and the net \nprimary school enrollment rate (2001) is about 37%\u2014the lowest rates in all of Pakistan. Literacy \nrates between genders and urban (70%) and rural (30%) areas (the majority (77%) live in rural \nareas)  differ  dramatically.  School  participation  is  low  at  66%  gross  enrollment  in  primary \neducation for both sexes (81% for boys and 48% for girls). Only about 63% of students in grade \n1 reach grade 10 after repeating several grades, indicating that many children leave school \nwithout appropriate skills and knowledge. \n \n4.  In 2001, the Federal Bureau of Statistics reported Balochistan\u2019s poverty level to be \n22.8%. However, the poverty reduction strategy for Balochistan notes that the 22.8% poverty \nfigure was \u201clargely a statistical aberration,\u201d and if past trends had continued, poverty would have \nrisen to 41.3% in 1998/99 against a national average of 32.1%. High levels of poverty have led \nto large variations in educational attainment among different economic groups. For instance, the \nnet enrollment in primary education was only 24% for the lowest economic quintile compared \nwith 39% for the highest. Key factors for the rapid increase in poverty during the 1990s were (i) \nthe slowdown in economic growth; (ii) negligible increase in per capita income; (iii) limited job \ngrowth and absorption capacity in the formal sector; (iv) high labor costs in the formal sector \nthat  lead  to  overexpansion  of  the  low  productivity  informal  sector,  thus  putting  downward \npressure on wages in the informal sector; (iii) limited opportunities for unskilled youth to obtain \non-the-job training and skills; and (iv) low quality of social services, particularly education and \nhealth.  \n \n5.  Pakistan\u2019s labor force grows at a rate of over 2.0% per annum, while employment grows \nmuch  more  slowly.  The  official  rate  of  unemployment  is  between  5.4\u20135.9%  whereas  the \nunderemployment rate (those working less than 35 hours a week) is estimated at about 12%. \nThe  situation  is  much  worse  in  Balochistan,  with  unemployment  over  10%  (over  21%  for \nfemales) and about 40% labor force participation rate (about 17% for females). Most workers \nare self-employed or unpaid family workers; wage earners account for less than one third. \nAmong urban unemployed youths between the ages of 10 and 24, the majority are either \n                                                 \n1 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2003.

The national Government is working to develop \nskilled workers and to generate employment especially in small and medium enterprises using \nindigenous  natural  resources.  The  international  demand  for  skilled  workers  is  increasing, \nespecially in middle-eastern countries and Malaysia. The Project will assist PGB in its efforts to \nreduce poverty by providing greater access to quality technical education and vocational training \n(TEVT) programs especially in rural areas and for women, and facilitate access to credit to help \nTEVT  graduates  seek  employment  or  engage  in  self-employment  in  small  and  medium \nenterprises. \n \n6.  Balochistan\u2019s TEVT subsector comprises two polytechnics\u2014one for women established \nunder the Technical Education Project (TEP)2\u2014with over 1,000 students (about 435 women) \nand about 130 teachers; and 11 technical and vocational training centers (TVTCs), with about \n1,300 students. Only 1 TVTC is for women. Opportunities in the local labor market are limited \nand  Balochistan  has  been  less  successful  than  the  other  provinces  in  accessing  the \ninternational job market. Given the low participation rate in general education, low completion \nrates at primary and secondary levels, and limited involvement of the private sector in the \neconomy and educational provision, PGB will have to adopt a two-pronged strategy: (i) improve \ngeneral school education as a priority, focusing on girls and rural children; and (ii) provide \nselective support to training programs as many youths lack the necessary employment skills. As \ngeneral education improves and provides more core life skills, support for TEVT will shift to \nmore practical aspects of training. However, for a few years, until general education improves \nsignificantly, TEVT will have to focus on formal and nonformal TEVT programs as a complement \nto general education, and not as a substitute. This approach benefits the poor who need a \nsecond chance for life skills. TEVT must be viewed from a holistic perspective to fill in gaps in \nthe context of overall educational needs. \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for development assistance to Pakistan3 \nfocuses  on  poverty  reduction  through  sustainable  pro-poor  growth,  inclusive  social \ndevelopment,  and  good  governance.  It  highlights  the  need  for  comprehensive  human \ndevelopment strategies, devolution of services for human development, and education reforms \nfor  quality.  In  particular,  it  supports  the  Education  Sector  Reforms  Action  Plan  of  the \nGovernment of Pakistan (Government) linked with the devolution process to promote public-\nprivate partnerships. It also emphasizes the need to move away from Government-based, \numbrella-based projects to more focused province-specific support. ADB\u2019s strategy is in line \nwith the Government\u2019s National Education Policy, Education Sector Reforms Action Plan, and \npoverty reduction strategy, and stresses the important role that TEVT plays in producing skilled \nworkers and technicians for the economy. The Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan 2001\u2013\n11 points out that options for technical, commercial, and vocational education in the country are \nstill limited and sets the introduction of technical education at secondary and postsecondary \nlevels as a priority. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  Despite  some  progress  in  the  province,  TEVT  still  faces  several  challenges  and \nconstraints,  which  need  to  be  addressed  systematically.  Appendix  1  provides  the  project \nframework, Appendix 2 the problem tree, and Appendix 3 a brief sector analysis. Some of the \nkey issues and opportunities are discussed in the following sections. \n \n                                                 \n2  Asian Development Bank. 1995.

Manila.  \n3  ADB. 2003. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006). Manila. \n ", "  3\n9.  Weak  Institutional  Capacity.  The  two  polytechnics  are  under  the  Directorate  of \nColleges, Higher, and Technical Education, which is responsible for planning, coordination, and \nsupervision of both higher (i.e., general) and technical education. Examinations of students of \ndiploma of associate engineer (DAE) programs, on the other hand, are organized by the Board \nof  Intermediate  and  Secondary  Education  (BISE),  which  is  responsible  for  conducting \nexaminations for students from elementary to technical levels. As more polytechnics will be \nestablished under the Government\u2019s Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan 2001\u201311 and the \nNational Education Policy 1998\u20132010, the planning, coordination, and supervision functions for \ntechnical education need to be integrated under one agency. PGB has approved in principle the \nestablishment  of  a  separate  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  (DTE)  in  anticipation  of \nexpanding technical education in the province. Given the important role of this directorate in \nimproving integration and coordination of TEVT institutions and programs, support for PGB in \nestablishing this directorate is urgently required.  \n \n10.  Low Internal and External Efficiency. The internal efficiency of polytechnic programs, \nwhile still a concern, has improved over the years. The dropout rates in the Government \nPolytechnic Institute for Boys (GPIB) averaged around 8% between 1997 and 2002. For the \nGovernment Polytechnic Institute for Women (GPIW), the dropout rate was about 12% in 2002, \nthe first year of its operation. The high dropout rate results in wastage of resources and must be \nseriously addressed. The average percentage of students who pass external examinations as \nper BISE records is quite low at 46% in 2002 compared with 65% in 1997.  \n \n11.  External efficiency as measured by the number of graduates who obtain employment \nafter graduation also needs to be improved. Based on the labor market survey conducted under \nan advisory technical assistance,4 graduates of DAE programs spent from 1\u20132 years seeking \nemployment before they found a job. In addition, they required an additional 3\u20136 months training \nin the industry after recruitment. While limited employment opportunities in the private sector are \npartly responsible for this difficulty finding employment, the quality and relevance of technical \neducation is also to blame (para. 15). Entrepreneurship training could be introduced to prepare \nstudents for self-employment, and job placement services provided for graduating students. \nBoth polytechnics and TVTCs could also offer short-term modular training programs for people \nwho want to acquire skills and start businesses of their own. Given that the Government \nencourages semiskilled and skilled workers to find out-of-country employment especially in the \nMiddle East and Malaysia, TEVT must play an important role in preparing for this. \n \n12.  Weak Linkage with Labor Market Needs. Although the demand for some traditional \ntrades  and  technologies  (electrical,  electronics,  and  mechanical)  and  new  trades  and \ntechnologies (computer, information, and telecommunication) is expected to remain high, the \nmismatch  between  skills  of  TEVT  graduates  and  labor  market  demand  means  that  TEVT \ngraduates have difficulty getting jobs even when opportunities exist. A labor market survey \nconfirms that (i) not enough graduates are being produced in some of the traditional courses \nand limited training opportunities are available in new technologies; and (ii) even if the courses \nare  available,  their  relevance  is  affected  by  lack  of  labor  market  information,  limited  and \ninappropriate practical training component, and lack of the necessary linkages with industries.  \n \n13.  The lack of sharing of information and resources between industry and TEVT institutions \ncreates a gap between users and producers of skilled workers, which in turn affects the quality \nof TEVT programs and graduates. As a result, students fail to acquire employable skills during \ntheir  training.  To  forge  a  closer  link  between  industries  and  TEVT  institutions,  institute \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Restructuring of Technical Education and Vocational Education \nSystem. Manila. \n   ", "4  \nmanagement  committees  (IMCs)  have  been  established  at  polytechnics  and  center \nmanagement committees (CMCs) at TVTCs. However, so far the IMCs and CMCs have not \nproved effective in drawing needed assistance and cooperation from industries. To increase \ntheir  effectiveness,  their  roles,  functions,  and  responsibilities  need  to  be  strengthened, \nleadership enhanced, and resource base improved. In addition, the committees, which include \nsignificant industry representation, need to focus on providing on-the-job training for students, \nindustrial training for TEVT teachers, and job placement services for TEVT graduates. \n \n14.  Limited Access to and Options for TEVT. With just two polytechnics and 11 technical \nand vocational training centers in the province of over 7 million people, Balochistan lags the \nother provinces in access to and options for TEVT. In Balochistan one TEVT institution is built \nfor about every 535,000 people, compared with one TEVT institution for 142,000 in Sindh, and \n311,000 in Punjab. This indicates the need to expand coverage with a particular focus on \nwomen and vulnerable groups. The two polytechnic institutes are located in Quetta and the 11 \ntraining centers are in major districts. Although the polytechnics provide a district quota for \nnomination of students to their training programs, the number, normally 5 seats per district, is \nstill low compared with the number of people and secondary school graduates who opt for \ntechnical education. To address the issue of limited access and options, both the Government \nand PGB plan to establish additional polytechnics, especially in economic growth centers. This \nexpansion plan is elaborated in the National Education Policy 1998\u20132010 and the Education \nSector Reforms Action Plan 2001\u20132005.  \n \n15.  Poor Quality of Examinations. TEVT students in DAE programs must take external \nexaminations conducted by BISE. The examinations consist of written tests (60%), practical \ntests  (20%),  and  internal  tests  given  by  the  lecturers  (20%).  The  problem  is  that  TEVT \ninstitutions \u201cteach for the exam\u201d rather than for transferring practical skills. Because of lack of \nfacilities and proper mechanisms, practical tests for certain subjects are given orally instead of \nrequiring students to actually perform the required tasks. For the written tests, a total of 167 \ntheory papers were prepared for the 10 technologies offered at the two polytechnics in 2002. \nThe  quality  of  the  content,  coverage,  types  of  questions,  practical  tests,  supervision  and \nadministration of the examinations, marking of papers, and announcements of results all need \nto be improved. In addition, the structure of the examinations for each technology needs to be \nmodified to be in line with the DAE curriculum, which specifies 60% for practical exercises and \n40% for the theory of the subject matters. \n \n16.  Role of the Public Sector. The TEVT system is highly supply driven and needs to \ndevelop  mechanisms  to  respond  to  market  needs.  Different  government  agencies  are \nresponsible  for  the  provision  of  TEVT  programs  resulting  in  lack  of  coherence  in  and \nfragmentation of TEVT programs. However, with the strong support for devolution and PGB\u2019s \nplan to consolidate TEVT coordination under one agency, an opportunity now exists to enhance \nthe organization of TEVT programs as well as limit the role of PGB to policy, planning, and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  as  envisaged  in  Government  policies  for  TEVT.  Implementation \nresponsibilities devolved to TEVT institutions will be supported by district advisory committees \n(DACs). \n \n17.  Lessons Learned. Appendix 4 provides a list of lessons learned and how they have \nbeen incorporated in the project design. Experience from the TEP and an ADB impact study  \nindicates the need to consolidate and strengthen existing TEVT institutions, while proceeding \ncautiously  with  expansion.5  This  includes  providing  adequate  resources  for  operation  and \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999.

Manila.  \n ", "  5\nmaintenance,  filling  all  vacant  teaching  positions,  and  ensuring  critical  inputs  for  effective \nteaching and learning. The high turnover of project directors, lack of information on labor market \nneeds,  and  absence  of  research  and  development  activities  have  adversely  affected \nimplementation activities and constrained TEVT institutions in responding to emerging market \nneeds.  \n \n18.  The  evolving  experience  with  institutional  consolidation  (from  406  institutions  in  7 \ndepartments  to  1  umbrella  department)  in  Punjab  and  its  efforts  to  move  away  from  the \ngovernment  being  a  provider  of  TEVT  to  standard  setting,  facilitation,  regulation,  and \ncoordination; Sindh\u2019s experience in devolution to the district level; and efforts by the North West \nFrontier  Province  to  consolidate  institutions,  provide  important  insight  and  implications  for \ninstitutional  development  and  strengthening  of  TEVT  institutions  in  Balochistan,  within  the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s devolution plan. Balochistan has already agreed in principle to \nconsolidate  institutional  arrangements  under  one  organization,  but  this  needs  to  be \ninstitutionalized  carefully  with  appropriate  planning  and  preparation.  Critically  needed  are \ninstitutionalized strategic planning, policy reform, quality assurance, curriculum development for \nTEVT, and support for gradual autonomy and strong leadership at polytechnics and training \ncenters to enable them to improve their overall effectiveness.   \n \n19.  External Assistance. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation has supported \ntechnical and vocational training in the province; however external support for TEVT is generally \nvery limited. External assistance to the education sector in Pakistan is discussed in Appendix 5. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n20.  The goal of the Project is to contribute to the Government\u2019s overall strategic goal of \npoverty reduction by enhancing competitiveness of the TEVT system and employability of its \ngraduates in line with emerging market needs. Focusing on Balochistan, the Project\u2019s specific \nobjectives are to (i) restructure and strengthen institutional capacity, efficiency, and autonomy of \nTEVT  institutions,  (ii)  improve  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs,  and  (iii)  enhance \naccess and equity to better quality TEVT particularly for the rural poor and women. \n   \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n21.  The Project has three components: (i) institutional development, (ii) improvement of \nquality and relevance of TEVT, and (iii) access and equity enhancement. \n \n1.  Component 1: Institutional Development \n \n22.  This  component  will  help  restructure  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  agencies \nresponsible for policy development, planning, and management of the TEVT system in line with \nthe Government\u2019s key policies on reforming TEVT. The policy implications are presented under \nassurances (para. 73) and Appendix 6. This component covers three subcomponents.  \n                 \na.  Strengthening Organization and Management Capacity  \n  of TEVT Facilities \n \n23.  This subcomponent will strengthen organization and management capacity of the DTE \nunder the Department of Education (DOE) and the Directorate of Manpower Training (DMT) \n   ", "6  \nunder the Department of Labor and Manpower (DOLM). The Project will help (i) establish the \nDTE and strengthen its capacity in research and development (R&D), and (ii) institutionalize a \nquality  assurance  and  accreditation  system  under  the  DTE  and  DMT.  The  DTE  will  be \nresponsible for development of policies, plans, and guidelines for institutional development and \nmanagement,  quality  assurance,  R&D,  curriculum  development,  and  staff  development \nprograms for technical education. The new DTE will be provided with a modest building, core \nstaff, office equipment, and furniture. The R&D cell to be transferred to the DTE will receive \ntraining for staff; funds and equipment for selective research studies and surveys; and support \nfor developing a full-fledged computerized management information system (MIS), labor market \ninformation  system  (LMIS),  and  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \n(PPMES). The R&D cell will undertake some research and studies and engage appropriate \nresearch and academic institutions through a competitive process to carry out more complex \nresearch and studies such as labor market surveys and tracer studies. \n \n24.  The Project will support the institutionalization of a quality assurance and accreditation \nsystem under BISE for DAE programs, and trade testing board (TTB) under DMT for technical \nand vocational training programs. The Project will help BISE and TTB develop accreditation \nstandards; a quality assurance system; and mechanisms including criteria, guidelines, manuals, \nand instruments for assessing and improving the quality of TEVT programs. Both BISE and TTB \nwill receive equipment, training of personnel, and seed money to implement the system in their \nrespective organization for both public and private TEVT institutions. The Project will also \nprovide training for staff of polytechnics and TVTCs to establish an internal quality assurance \nunit at all TEVT institutions.  \n \nb.  Implementing a Performance-Based Management System \n  for TEVT Facilities \n \n25.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  a  performance-based  management \nsystem in all TEVT institutions to promote accountability and efficiency in TEVT management. \nTEVT institutions will be required to prepare a 5-year institutional development plan, which will \nserve as the basis for budgetary allocations. Indicators such as enrollment, number of poor \nstudents in the programs, dropout rate, passing rate, and employment of graduates will be \ndeveloped and used to assess efficiency and effectiveness of the institutions. The Project will \nprovide funds to develop guidelines, criteria, and operation manuals for implementation of the \nsystem. Block funds from the Project will be allocated to provide incentives to selected high \nperforming project facilities to undertake additional development. Gradually, TEVT institutions \nwill develop the capacity to be more autonomous in managing their own operations. PGB will \nissue a notification to institutionalize the performance-based management system, which will be \ntied to budgetary allocations after project completion. Consulting services will be provided to \ndevelop and implement the system. \n \nc.  Strengthening Capacity of TEVT Facilities \n \n26.  The Project will (i) help strengthen TEVT capacity to plan, manage, and assess their \noperation and performance; (ii) establish DACs, and strengthen the capacity and resources of \nIMCs and CMCs; and (iii) implement management development programs (MDPs) for key TEVT \nofficials including principals and key staff members. \n \n27.  Strengthening Capacity of TEVT Institutions. In line with the Government\u2019s TEVT \npolicy and devolution plan, the Project will help TEVT institutions develop capacity to plan, \nmanage,  and  evaluate  their  own  operations  and  performance.  Principals  and  staff  will  be \n ", "  7\nprovided  training  in  key  competencies  to  enable  them  to  develop  a  5-year  institutional \ndevelopment  plan  that  clearly  identifies  objectives,  targets,  staffing  requirements,  capacity-\nbuilding needs, and resource allocation and requirements to help them achieve the objectives \nfor medium- and long-term development of their institutions. Staff development programs in the \nareas  of  market  analysis,  financial  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  organization \nmanagement, and social marketing will be implemented under the Project. By 12 months after \nproject implementation begins, TEVT institutions will also prepare a resource mobilization and \nutilization plan to ensure sustainability of new investments. An institution will be selected to \ncarry  out  the  capacity-building  programs  at  TEVT  institutions.  Eventually,  the  institutional \ndevelopment plan will serve as a basis for the disbursements of project resources to the \ninstitutions to implement programs and activities that will contribute to the achievements of the \nobjectives specified in the plan. To consolidate TEVT programs, DTE and DMT will prepare (12 \nmonths  after  project  implementation  begins)  a  TEVT  rationalization  plan,  teacher  career \ndevelopment plan, and a plan for gradual autonomy of TEVT institutions to strengthen the TEVT \nsystem.  \n \n28.  Establishing DACs and Strengthening the Capacity and Resources of IMCs and \nCMCs. The Project will support the establishment of DACs in districts with polytechnics and \nTVTCs. The DAC, comprising representatives of industries, educational institutions, and the \ncommunities, will help promote closer collaboration between local industries, the communities, \nand the institutions in order to mobilize resources and support from the private sector to the \nTEVT institutions. In addition, it will support the IMCs and CMCs to provide support in linking \nTEVT institutions with industries on a district-wide basis. The Project will help strengthen the \nIMCs and CMCs in all TEVT institutions. Modest financial resources will be provided on a \ncompetitive basis, based on proposals submitted by the IMCs and CMCs, as seed money to \nenable them to carry out their functions more effectively. Capacity-building programs will be \nconducted for members of the committees. In addition, procedure manuals will be developed for \nreference of the committees and TEVT institutions.  \n \n29.  Implementing  MDP  at  TEVT  Facilities.  Qualified  local  management  institutions \nincluding universities and higher education institutions will be invited to submit proposals to \nimplement the MDP for staff of TEVT institutions under a management contract. The MDP will \nhelp improve the capability of principals, teachers, and staff to assume more responsibilities and \nautonomy in planning, management, and effective resource mobilization and utilization in their \ninstitutions. The MDP will cover such key areas as market and competitiveness analysis for \ndemand-based  training,  financial  planning  and  management,  performance  improvement, \ninstitutional development, proposal preparation and project implementation, and evaluation of \ntraining  programs.  The  MDP  will  support  TEVT  institutions  based  on  the  institutional \ndevelopment plans to enhance the competitiveness of polytechnics and TVTCs.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Improvement of Quality and Relevance of TEVT \n \n30.  This component will help improve the quality and relevance of TEVT programs in four \npolytechnics (two existing and two new) and 14 TVTCs (11 existing and 3 new). The component \ncovers  three  key  areas:  (i)  developing  a  competency-based  training  (CBT)  system  and \nreforming examinations, (ii) improving quality by upgrading facilities and developing learning \nresources, and (iii) improving relevance of TEVT through innovative schemes.  \n \n \n \n \n   ", "8  \n    a.  Providing Competency-Based Training System Development \n      and Examination Reform  \n \n31.  CBT  System  Development.  The  Project  will  help  develop  a  framework  and \nmechanisms for introducing the CBT6 system in TEVT institutions, and provide training to \nteachers to prepare lessons, instructional materials, and learning modules for their subjects in \nthe CBT format with a focus on helping students to practice and acquire the skills that meet \nindustry  standards.  Each  project  institution  will  be  required  to  nominate  courses  in \ntechnologies/trades to be converted into the CBT format for funding under the Project. At a \nminimum, each technology/trade will convert at least one course into the CBT format. The \nProject  will  support  this  initiative  by  providing  funds  to  teachers  who  submit  proposals  to \ndevelop lessons, instructional materials, and learning modules and packages in the CBT format \nfor their courses. A qualified institution will be selected to train the teachers and coordinate the \ndevelopment, implementation, and monitoring of the CBT system. Funds will be provided to \nconduct social marketing programs to raise an awareness of principals, teachers, students, \ncommunities, and potential employers about the characteristics and benefits of the CBT system. \nThe CBT system is expected to be introduced gradually in all TEVT programs through active \nparticipation of the teachers and institutions with incentives initiated under the Project. \n \n32.  Examination Reform. Currently one of the responsibilities of BISE, established in 1977 \nas an autonomous corporate body, is conducting examinations at the DAE level for students of \npolytechnics. The current examination practices are inflexible and not conducive to promoting \nstudent acquisition of practical skills required by industries. PGB will issue a notice to allow the \nProject to reform the examination system by preparing a framework and an operation manual to \nintroduce a new system in which TEVT institutions will be given autonomy and responsibilities to \nconduct skills tests based on the CBT format. Teachers will be trained on how to prepare \nreliable and valid skills tests and practical examinations. The Project will also provide support to \nBISE  and  the  TTB  to  help  strengthen  capacity  and  improve  the  quality  of  the  theoretical \nexaminations.  This  will  include  training  examiners  and  paper  setters,  computerizing  the \nexamination system, developing an examination items bank, strengthening the examination \nmanagement system, and providing office equipment and materials.  \n \n    b.  Improving Quality by Upgrading Facilities and Developing \n      Learning Resources  \n \n33.  Upgrading DAE Programs at Polytechnics. The Project will upgrade equipment and \ntraining materials of four of the seven existing technologies at GPIB (civil, electrical, electronics, \nand  chemical)  that  are  identified  as  providing  good  employment  prospects  for  students. \nOutdated and nonoperational equipment will be replaced, and instructional materials in the CBT \nformat developed to help improve the quality of the training programs. The Project will support \nGPIW to introduce one new technology for architecture focusing on computer-aided design; \nstrengthen  existing  technologies  selectively;  and  support  the  provision  of  teacher \naccommodation for female teachers recruited from other provinces. The Project will provide \nadditional  workshops,  laboratories,  equipment,  teachers,  and  funds  for  acquisition  and \ndevelopment of instructional materials in the CBT format for the implementation of the new \ntechnologies. \n \n34.  Support Implementation of Bachelor of Technology (Electronics) at GPIB. The \nQuetta GPIB has recently been awarded the status of Government College of Technology to \n                                                 \n6  CBT training system is a TEVT training scheme that emphasizes trainees\u2019 abilities to perform tasks at a specified \nproficiency level according to industry standards, and provides a wide range of opportunities for learners and \ntrainees to practice and acquire skills and knowledge and develop positive attitudes to become competent workers. \n ", "  9\noffer a baccalaureate program in technology. It has been sanctioned to offer a baccalaureate \nprogram in electronics and obtained initial funding for construction of a building block from the \nMinistry of Science and Technology. To enable GPIB to continue with activities to implement the \nbachelor of technology (electronics) program initially on a limited scale, the Project will provide \nfunds to establish laboratories and procure the necessary equipment, furniture, and instructional \nmaterials for the program. Project funds will be disbursed on the conditions that (i) PGB will \nprovide additional funding to complete the construction of the building; and (ii) GPIB will prepare \na  detailed  development  plan  for  approval  by  PGB  concerning  the  implementation  of  the \nbachelor of technology program including affiliation with a university, staffing requirements, \nrecurrent expenditures, enrollments, and measures to ensure that the students will successfully \ncomplete their studies and find employment after graduation. \n  \n35.  Upgrading of Technical Training and Vocational Training Centers. The Project will \nsupport TVTC Quetta, the largest of the 11 existing TVTCs in terms of student enrollment and \nnumber of trades offered (13 trades), to become a model TVTC for the province. Its workshop \nfacilities  are  also  used  by  the  Staff  Training  Institute,  housed  in  the  same  premises,  for \nupgrading skills of teachers from TVTCs in the province. To access project funds, TVTC Quetta \nwill prepare a 5-year institutional development plan to become a model center with the objective \nof  becoming  more  self-reliant  and  autonomous  in  its  academic,  technical,  and  financial \nmanagement during the project period.  \n   \n36.  The  Project  will  provide  the  necessary  workshops,  classrooms,  equipment,  and \ninstructional materials to the vocational training center in Gwadar, which is designated as an \nindustrial hub and emerging sea port, to support new training programs on fisheries, computer \ntechnology, telecommunications, and welding. The fishing industry in Gwadar is among the \nlargest industries in Balochistan. The Project will involve the Department of Fisheries and \nCoastal Development to (i) develop training programs, curriculum, and instructional materials for \nthe training courses; (ii) provide initial teaching staff from its cadre of officers; (iii) train teachers \nat Gwadar vocational training center; (iv) supervise the standard and quality of the training \nprograms; and (v) conduct social marketing programs to increase awareness and acceptance of \nthe program among potential clients.  \n \n37.  Development of Learning Resource Centers at Polytechnics and TVTCs. In support \nof the CBT system and to allow teachers and students to pursue self-learning, a learning \nresource center and library will be established at all polytechnics and TVTCs. The Project will \nprovide computers, software, multimedia packages, books, and journals, which will be housed \npreferably in the library of each TEVT institution.  \n \n    c.  Improving Relevance of TEVT through Innovative Schemes  \n   \n38.  This subcomponent will introduce innovative schemes to enhance employability of TEVT \ngraduates.  The  Project  will  help  introduce  an  entrepreneurship  training  program  in  TEVT \ncurriculum in partnership with the private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \nNew curriculum, textbooks, manuals, and instructional materials following the CBT format will be \ndeveloped and implemented in all TEVT institutions. The entrepreneurship training modules will \nbe made mandatory for all TEVT students. Teachers will receive training to conduct the program \nusing the materials prepared under the Project. In addition to entrepreneurship training, the \nProject  will  involve  the  consulting  services  along  with  experienced  private  sector/NGOs  to \ndevelop mechanisms and facilitate access to credit to help TEVT graduates start their own \nbusinesses and thus provide self-employment opportunities for TEVT graduates. Appropriate \nguidelines and procedures to access credit will be developed. \n   ", "10  \n \n39.  The Project will support an on-the-job training scheme as an integral part of the TEVT \ncurriculum  to  enable  students  to  acquire  relevant  skills,  knowledge,  work  discipline,  and \nindustrial and work experience in industries through structured learning exercises. The scheme \nwill help foster closer cooperation between TEVT institutions and the private sector. The IMCs \nand CMCs will be strengthened to establish linkages and operational mechanisms with local \nindustries to support this scheme. The IMCs and CMCs will actively pursue the possibility of \nintroducing evening shifts in partnership with NGOs/private sector to provide teachers with \nadditional income, to enhance the utilization of equipment and building, and to infuse new \norganizational skills in public TEVT institutions. The Project will develop necessary operational \nguidelines, mechanisms, and procedures to ensure effective implementation of the scheme.  \n \n40.  The Project will establish a career guidance and job placement center at all TEVT \ninstitutions by providing furniture, equipment, and career guidance materials. A qualified staff \nmember will be trained and assigned as a career guidance and job placement officer either on a \nfull- or part-time basis. With the support of the CMC/IMC, the center will liaise regularly with \nindustries to obtain information about job openings and provide career guidance and counseling \nservices  to  TEVT  students  to  find  employment  in  industries.  The center  will maintain  and \nregularly update a database on local industries, job openings, job placements, and employment \nrecords of TEVT graduates. \n \n41.  The Project will establish a production and service center in partnership with the private \nsector in selected TEVT institutions. The center will accept work orders for production and \nprovide services to both internal and external clients. The management of the unit will be \ncontracted out to qualified private institutions or NGOs that are willing to engage teachers from \nthe TEVT institutions and train the students on a profit-sharing basis. The students will be given \nallowances for their work at the center. TEVT institutions will be allowed to retain a share of the \nincome for their own use. The Project will provide facilities, equipment, furniture, and seed \nmoney to establish the center and support its initial operations. The center is expected to \nbecome self-sufficient and will be managed independently as a business unit. \n     \n3.  Component 3: Access and Equity Enhancement \n \n42.  This component covers three areas to provide greater access to TEVT among the rural \npoor and women, especially those who lack opportunities to obtain skills training in formal TEVT \nprograms.  \n \n    a.  Introducing Equivalency and Certification System \n \n43.  The Project will help BISE and TTB to establish an equivalency and certification system \nwith appropriate mechanisms for skills assessments based on the CBT standards. The system \nwill give qualifying credits and issue trade certificates to students, trainees, and workers who \npass the external examinations and assessments. The equivalency system will provide learning \nopportunities for those who have acquired other forms of prior learning as well as opportunities \nfor skilled workers to obtain formal qualifications for career development and for employment in \nother  countries.  BISE  and  DMT  will  be  responsible  for  developing,  implementing,  and \ninstitutionalizing the equivalency and certification system for their respective agency. Skills \nassessment centers will be established at selected polytechnics and TVTCs. They will be \nprovided with necessary infrastructure, equipment, and materials to help launch the equivalency \nand certification system; and social marketing activities to increase awareness and promote \n ", " 11\nbetter  understanding  and  acceptance  of  the  equivalency  and  certification  system  among \nstudents and the public.  \n \n    b.  Implementing Nonformal Livelihood Skills Improvement Programs \n \n44.  Nonformal  training  programs  to  improve  livelihood  and  provide  employable  skills  to \nabout 20,000 out-of-school youths and adults (at least 50% women) will be provided largely \nthrough qualified NGOs identified competitively. Interested polytechnics and TVTCs can also \ncompete for the funds and may choose to partner with NGOs. Subjects and topics will be based \non the needs of the communities and employment opportunities in the areas. Course duration \nwill be flexible, but normally shorter than the standard training programs. Course fees will be \nminimal  to  ensure  some  cost  recovery  and  enable  the  poor  to  acquire  skills  needed  for \nemployment and livelihood improvement. To be eligible for the funds, TEVT institutions and \nNGOs  will  conduct  situation  analysis  with  relevant  stakeholders  and  potential  trainees  for \nplanning of livelihood training programs on farms and nonfarm activities for the poor. After \nsituation analysis, the TEVT institutions and NGOs will submit a proposal to conduct nonformal \nlivelihood training programs to the project management units for approval and funding. Locally \nbased livelihood training programs will be introduced to reach remote communities and the rural \npoor. The amount of financial support will be based on the duration of the course, the number of \ntrainees, and other related criteria. TEVT institutions offering nonformal training programs will be \nallowed to retain and utilize the money from the Project and the fees to supplement their regular \nbudgets. The nonformal livelihood training programs could eventually be made a regular feature \nof TEVT institutions as outreach/community services and to promote employment opportunities \nand livelihood employment among the poor in the province. \n \n    c.  Establishing Two New Polytechnics and Three Technical Training \n      Centers \n \n45.  In line with the National Education Policy and in support of PGB\u2019s plan to provide \nequitable access to TEVT and to promote industrial development in the province, the Project will \nestablish two polytechnics\u2014one in Gwadar (men) and the other in Khuzdar (women). Each \npolytechnic  will  be  provided  with  classroom  and  laboratory  blocks,  student  hostel,  teacher \naccommodation  for  the  women\u2019s  polytechnic  in  Khuzdar,  training  equipment,  instructional \nmaterials,  and  other  learning  resources.  The  polytechnic  at  Gwadar  will  initially  offer  four \ntechnologies: three will be information technology, telecommunication, and food preservation. \nThe fourth will be determined by a market survey to be conducted during the first year of project \nimplementation. The polytechnic in Khuzdar will initially offer four technologies: three will be  \ndressmaking and fashion design, information technology, and secretarial practices and office \nmanagement. The fourth one will be determined by a market survey to be conducted during the \nfirst year of project implementation. \n \n46.  The Project will establish three TVTCs for women in Hub, Loralai, and Turbat, all with \npotential for high economic growth. These institutions provide better opportunities especially to \nwomen and the rural population to obtain employable skills, which will further enhance their \nlivelihood. Hub will provide up to six technologies (radio and television, refrigeration and air-\nconditioning, industrial electronic, dress designing and dressmaking, computer hardware and \nsoftware, and household appliances repair). Loralali will offer up to five technologies (food \npreservation,  dress  designing  and  dressmaking,  computers,  leather  crafts,  and  household \nappliances). Turbat will provide up to five technologies (food preservation, embroidery, dress \ndesigning and dressmaking, electronics, and household appliances repair). The Project will \nprovide teachers and instructional materials, and support new construction, equipment, and \n   ", "12  \nfurniture. The Project will support the preparation of a gender action plan to improve gender \nimbalance in the TEVT subsector.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n47.  The Project supports PGB to consolidate TEVT programs, with cautious expansion \nlinked to greater emphasis on market needs and women and rural poor. The consolidation effort \nemphasizes integrating and strengthening TEVT programs in existing institutions, focusing on \nfilling all teacher vacancies, providing in-service training to teachers, improving quality and \nrelevance  of  existing  programs,  and  allocating  adequate  budget  for  basic  operation  and \nmaintenance before embarking on any large-scale expansion.  \n \n48.  The Project emphasizes improving institutional efficiency through greater autonomy and \nensuring effective leadership of TEVT institutions, greater partnership with the private sector in \nrunning evening classes and production units, and supporting performance-based management \nto make TEVT institutions more competitive, relevant, accountable, and responsive to labor \nmarket needs.  \n \n49.  The Project emphasizes equity and access by supporting TEVT programs for females \nand the poor in rural areas. The Project is also exploring the possibility of introducing double \nshifts in selected TEVT institutions to run programs for both female and male students. The \nProject supports construction of selected hostel facilities for women who come from rural areas. \nThe  Project  supports  more  relevant  livelihood  programs  (for  example,  fisheries,  livestock, \nagriculture, food preservation, and crafts) and access to microcredit for rural females and rural \npoor, and also supports the engagement of NGOs to provide services to out-of-school youth, \nwomen, and rural poor. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n52.  The Executing Agency will be the Planning and Development Department. A steering \ncommittee  headed  by  the  additional  chief  secretary  of  the  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment has been established, including secretaries of DOE, DOLM, and department of \nfinance; chief economist and chief of foreign aid at the Planning and Development Department; \nand representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the districts of Gwadar and Khuzdar, \nto coordinate policy reform, address implementation bottlenecks, and provide overall guidance. \nThe  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  review  project  implementation. \nImplementation arrangements are elaborated in Appendix 8. \n \n53.  DOE  and  DOLM  will  be  the  implementing  agencies,  each  with  a  separate  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), with a project director recruited competitively and with qualifications, \nexperience,  and  expertise  acceptable  to  ADB.  Additional  staff  includes  an \naccounts/disbursement officer, a procurement officer, monitoring and evaluation officer, and \nother staff as appropriate with qualifications, experience, and expertise acceptable to ADB. The \nproject director in each PMU will be responsible for overall project implementation in close \ncollaboration with the concerned departments and recipient institutions and will be retained for \nat least 3 years unless performance issues are identified. Each PMU will organize quarterly \nimplementation review meetings and prepare quarterly reports on implementation progress to \nbe submitted to the steering committee and ADB for review. DOE was also the executing \nagency for the recently completed TEP, while the DMT at DOLM built its capacity through \ncomprehensive support from the German Agency for Technical Cooperation over 13 years.  \n   ", "14  \n \n54.  Each district affected by the Project will establish a DAC (para. 28) and will assign a \ndistrict project coordinator to supervise and implement district activities as appropriate, with \nsupport from the PMU. Each coordinator will seek inputs as necessary from consultants and \nexperts from concerned PGB offices to implement district activities.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n55.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  April  2005,  and  will  be \ncompleted by the end of October 2010. A tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n56.  ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil works will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  civil  works  contract  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent  of  more  than  $1,000,000  and  each  supply  contract  for  equipment  or  materials \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational competitive bidding. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to \ncost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. \nCivil works contracts equivalent to $1,000,000 or less may be awarded on the basis of local \ncompetitive bidding. Equipment and textbooks estimated to cost, in aggregate, the equivalent of \nless than $100,000 may be directly procured. The indicative contract packages are in Appendix \n10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n57.  A total of 77 person-months of consulting services (18 person-months of international \nand 59 person-months of domestic) will be utilized following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. A higher education institution and or a management institute will be selected and \nengaged for the MDP, performance-based management, and development of the CBT system. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged individually (for project management and for \nspecific technical expertise) or as a firm. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be \napplied for the selection and engagement of consulting firms. Appendix 11 provides indicative \nterms of reference and consulting requirements. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n58.  The  Planning  and  Development  Department  will,  immediately  after  the  loan \neffectiveness, establish two imprest accounts, one for each of the PMUs. The accounts will be \nin a Government-approved bank  acceptable to ADB to  expedite disbursement of the loan \nproceeds, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nbetween the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited into each of the imprest \naccounts will not exceed $300,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be followed \nto liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000. \nDuring midterm review, PGB and ADB may decide to reallocate funds to DOE or DOLM, \ndepending on the progress made in order to support effective implementation and potential \nreform. \n \n59.  To expedite preparatory activities, DOE and DOLM must undertake advance action, in \nparticular the selection and engagement of a higher education institution and/or management \n ", " 15\ninstitute, selection and engagement of consultants, and the preparation of request for proposals. \nRetroactive financing of up to $200,000 has been approved in principle for expenditures for \npreparatory activities incurred between project appraisal and loan effectiveness. All advance \naction will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB has advised \nPGB that the approval of advance action and retroactive financing (in principle) does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n60.  Each PMU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation in line with ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report and submit them to ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter. \nWithin 3 months of physical completion, each PMU will submit a project completion report to \nADB. Each PMU will (i) maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures financed \nout of the loan proceeds; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to \nADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s report. The audit report will include an audit \nwith separate opinion on the use of imprest accounts and statement of expenditure procedure. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System \n \n61.  The  Project  focuses  on  strengthening  the  MIS,  LMIS,  and  PPMES,  as  well  as \nundertaking research on important areas such as tracer studies of graduates and labor market \nsurveys. During the first year, the Project will help the DTE and DMT establish a comprehensive \nPPMES by developing baseline information on all TEVT institutions, and developing MIS and \nLMIS linked to a set of key monitoring indicators indicated in the project framework. The PPMES \nwill help monitor progress made on key indicators over the project period, and also support all \nTEVT  institutions  to  monitor  their  performance  against  the  indicators  presented  in  their \ninstitutional  development  plan.  The  performance  indicators  will  cover  internal  and  external \nefficiency, as well as quality and institutional indicators such as number of teacher positions \nfilled, quality of teachers, availability of instructional materials, and institutional capacity. The \nPPMES will allow comparison between the status at the time of project start-up, and outputs at \nmidterm  and  end  of  the  Project.  TEVT  annual  planning  and  budgeting  will  be  linked  to \ninformation available from the PPMES. The PPMES will establish mechanisms to introduce \nmandatory  reporting  and  sharing  of  information  with  the  public.  To  ensure  effective  and \ntransparent utilization of resources, PGB will require the TEVT institutions to provide financial \ninformation to DACs each year. Appendix 12 provides a list of key indicators and strategy for the \nPPMES. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n62.  PGB and ADB will jointly conduct two semiannual reviews (at least one full review) of the \nProject every year. PGB and ADB will jointly establish the issues to be addressed during each \nmission and reports required. During the third year of implementation, PGB and ADB will carry \nout a midterm review of implementation arrangements, with a focus on a few key issues. ADB \nand PGB will consider changes based on the findings of the midterm review. \n   ", "16  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n63.  The  Project  focuses  on  consolidating  and  strengthening  existing  TEVT  programs  in \nBalochistan with cautious expansion by improving the capacity of TEVT institutions to become \nmore competitive; providing better quality and more relevant skills to TEVT students in selected \ntechnologies; and helping improve equitable access among women and rural poor. The Project is \ndesigned to make TEVT more responsive to labor market needs and support the graduates to \neither find suitable initial employment in the local or international markets without long waiting time \nor to seek microcredit to start their own businesses. The Project\u2019s staff development activities \nbenefit teachers of the participating TEVT institutions by improving their practical and subject skills. \nAll these inputs are expected to improve external efficiency of the TEVT system in the form of \ngreater employment opportunities and higher earnings.  \n \n64.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  over  6  years  will  be  about  10,000  students \nenrolled (about 2,500 graduates) in four polytechnics (two existing and two new), about 10,000 \nstudents (about the same number of graduates) in 14 training centers (11 existing and 3 new), \nand about 20,000 out-of-school youth and adults to receive nonformal livelihood training. Other \ndirect beneficiaries include over 150 teachers and principals in polytechnics and 600 in training \ncenters, and about 250 IMC and CMC members. Based on the demographic profile of the \nprovince and anticipated expansion of TEVT, about 75% of the total direct beneficiaries are \nanticipated to come from rural areas, about 25% will be female, and about 40% will be from \neconomically poor families. Poorer communities will benefit mostly from the livelihood programs, \nbut also from the DAE and trades programs since most of these students are unable to proceed \nto general education. \n \n65.  The DAE and trades programs will benefit small and medium enterprises in the province \nthrough the introduction of improved learning methods, resource materials, and modern up-to-\ndate equipment. The focus on practical application and linkages with the industry for both the \nstudents and teachers will allow polytechnics and training centers to learn from the industry, \nwhile the industry will be able to get more skilled graduates to improve their productivity. TEVT \ngraduates  will  also  be  able  to  prepare  for  the  international  market,  which  has  provided \nemployment opportunities to many Pakistanis and contributes to the overall economy through \nincreasing remittances. Livelihood training will provide opportunities in rural areas for out-of-\nschool youths and adults to acquire skills for employment and to start their own ventures. With \nthe support of NGOs, the provision of programs that are in demand and have much greater \nflexibility should be possible. Credit facilitation support will allow TEVT graduates to access \nmicrocredit  to  start  small  ventures  and  help  generate  income  and  employment  in  the \ncommunities. All these measures are expected to help reduce poverty in the province especially \nin rural areas where educational opportunities are still very limited. The Project also addresses \nthe needs of women by expanding opportunities and increasing access to quality TEVT through \nthe strengthening of existing polytechnic institutes and training centers, and supporting the \nestablishment of two new training centers.  \n \nB.  Project Risks \n \n66.  The  Project  faces  four  possible  risks:  financial,  institutional,  policy,  and  economic. \nAppendix 14 identifies potential risks and proposed mitigation measures. First, PGB\u2019s effort to \nexpand TEVT without adequate focus on consolidating and ensuring effective services at the \nexisting training institutes could erode the financial and technical base needed to run these \n ", " 17\ninstitutions effectively. The Project supports measures to strengthen the capacity and greater \nautonomy of TEVT institutions and seeks PGB\u2019s assurances for adequate recurrent budgets \nand necessary provision to enable TEVT institutions to manage their financial resources based \non the needs of the institutions. Economic and financial analyses are presented in Appendix 14. \n \n67.  Second, TEVT institutions lack autonomy and many lack effective leadership to make \nthem responsive to labor market needs. While most TEVT institutions have IMCs or CMCs \ndepending on  the  type  of  institution,  only  a few  of  these  committees  are  effective  largely \nbecause of weak governance structure and weak role of the principals. The Project includes an \nMDP and performance-based management system to strengthen the capacity of principals, \nteachers, and staff of TEVT institutions. The Project also supports capacity-building programs \nfor members of IMCs and CMCs together with modest financial assistance to make them more \neffective in providing support to TEVT institutions. \n \n68.  Third, while the federal policy on TEVT envisages substantial improvement in the quality, \nmanagement, and financing of TEVT programs, this will not be possible without linking the \nperformance of TEVT institutions with improvement in plans, targets, and policy stipulations. \nThe  Project  aims  to  increase  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  TEVT  institutions  through \ninnovative measures such as a quality assurance and accreditation system; performance-based \nmanagement  system;  and  examination  reform  to  enable  the  institutions  to  focus  on \nimprovement  of  quality,  relevance,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  their  programs  and \noperations. The Project also seeks PGB assurances to align key TEVT policies at the provincial \nlevel. \n \n69.  Fourth,  the  economy  is  not  growing  fast  enough  to  absorb  more  TEVT  graduates. \nRelated to this is the limited involvement of the private sector in TEVT institutions. Unless the \nprivate sector, which is going to be the main provider of employment, is more actively engaged, \nTEVT graduates will continue to have difficulty finding jobs. The Project supports much greater \ninvolvement  of  the  private  sector  through  IMCs  and  CMCs,  production  units,  guidance \ncounseling, more organized labor market information, and credit facilitation for self-employment. \n \nC.  Environment \n \n70.  Category B. An initial environment examination was undertaken and the summary is in \nsupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nD.  Social Analysis \n \n71.  The  Project  aims  to  increase  equity  in  and  effectiveness  of  TEVT  programs  by \nsupporting three training centers and one polytechnic for women who will mostly come from \nrural areas. The focus on improving quality and organization of all TEVT institutions will benefit \nstudents largely from poorer families from rural areas. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 15. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.   Specific Assurances \n \n72.  In addition to the standard assurances, PGB has given the following assurances, which \nhave been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n   ", "18  \n73.  To  implement  new  initiatives  and  programs  to  improve  the  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency of the TEVT programs and institutions in accordance with the national policies on the \nTEVT subsector, PGB commits to issue within 12 months of loan effectiveness the following \nbinding directives:  \n \n(i)  TEVT institutions in Balochistan will (a) adopt the CBT system developed under \nthe Project for selective subjects and courses in all trades and technologies; (b) \nrequire teachers of these subjects/courses to conduct practical examinations \nfollowing  the  CBT  principles  and  format;  (c)  develop,  implement,  and/or \nstrengthen on-the-job training programs as an integral part of the curriculum for \nall  technologies  and  trades;  (d)  encourage  teachers  to  obtain  industrial \nexperience with pay as part of the ongoing in-service training programs; and (e) \ngradually  assume  more  autonomy  in  the  management  and  utilization  of \nresources including retention of revenues to support their activities according to \nthe PBMS to be introduced under the Project. \n \n(ii)  BISE and DMT will develop, implement, institutionalize, and/or strengthen the (a) \nequivalency and certification system in Balochistan to provide more opportunities \nand  greater  access  to  TEVT  for  out-of-school  youths  and  adults,  and  (b) \naccreditation  and  quality  assurance  system  to  improve  the  quality  of  TEVT \ninstitutions in Balochistan. \n \n74.  To ensure continuity, efficiency, and smooth implementation of the Project, PGB agrees \nthat each project director will be recruited for at least a term of 3 years. In case of an absolute \nnecessity to replace a project director, inter alia, due to unsatisfactory performance, PGB will \nrecruit  a  new  project  director,  on  a  competitive  basis,  with  qualifications,  experience,  and \nexpertise acceptable to ADB. \n \n75.  To ensure effective and timely implementation of the Project, PGB commits that upon \ncompletion of the TEP, essential experienced staff of the TEP project implementation unit will be \ntransferred to the PMU at DOE. \n \n76.  PGB will sanction recruitment of necessary teaching and nonteaching staff for (a) any \nnew polytechnics and training centers before procurement of equipment for and construction of \nthese polytechnics and training centers; and (b) any new programs contemplated under the \nProject before commencement of these programs. PGB will start recruitment of such staff \nimmediately  after  the  (a)  establishment  of  new  polytechnics  and  training  centers,  and  (b) \ncommencement of new programs. \n \n77.  PGB commits to establish a DTE with necessary staff and budget within 9 months of \nloan effectiveness. \n \n78.  PGB agrees that the existing R&D cell will become part of the PMU, at DOE. PGB \nfurther agrees that within 9 months of loan effectiveness (a) the R&D cell will integrate with the \nDTE, and (b) PGB will become responsible for its expenses. \n \n79.  Unless agreed otherwise, PGB will ensure that within 9 months of loan effectiveness \neach TEVT institution will develop and submit for review and approval of the PMUs at DOE and \nDOLM a 5-year institutional development plan that clearly identifies objectives, targets, staffing \nrequirements, capacity building needs, and budgetary requirements to qualify for civil works, \nequipment, and other support from the Project. \n ", " 19\n  \n80.  PGB will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, requisite counterpart funds \nfrom its budget for each fiscal year for the smooth implementation of the Project.  \n \n81.  By midterm review of the Project, PGB and ADB will evaluate the necessity for and \nimplications of integrating TEVT institutions in Balochistan under one umbrella. \n \n82.  PGB will ensure that within 11 months after loan effectiveness, the newly established \nDTE will enhance competitiveness of the polytechnics and the existing DMT to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of technical training centers, and vocational training centers will prepare for \nPGB\u2019s  approval  a  5-year  plan  encompassing  (i)  TEVT  rationalization,  (ii)  teacher  career \ndevelopment,  and  (iii)  gradual  autonomy  for  TEVT  institutions.  PGB  commits  that  the \nimplementation of such a plan will begin within 1 month after its approval.  \n \n83.  PGB commits to maintain the additional recurrent costs of approximately $0.6 million \nequivalent required annually after project completion on 31 October 2010 to sustain the project \ninvestments.  \n \n84.  PGB will ensure that a basic MIS and LMIS including all baseline information will be set \nup by the PMUs at DOE and DOLM within 12 months of loan effectiveness with plans for further \ndevelopment during the project period. \n \n85.  PGB will ensure women's participation in project implementation in accordance with the \ngender strategy set out in Appendix 15, and that at least 50% of the livelihood training programs \nwill include women. A gender action plan to improve gender imbalances in the TEVT subsector \nwill be prepared jointly by the DOE PMU and DOLM PMU, and approved and implemented by \nthe DTE and DMT within 12 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n86.  PGB  confirms  that  all  required  land  for  the  Project  is  PGB\u2019s  land,  free  from  any \nencumbrances, structures, human settlements or cultivation. PGB further confirms that the \nProject will not entail any land acquisition or resettlement and no persons will be adversely \naffected in terms of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople. \n \n87.  PGB  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  safety  measures  are \nincluded in the design of the project facilities and will ensure that the project facilities are \nconstructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy. PGB \nwill ensure implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures as set out in the initial \nenvironmental examination carried out for the Project. \n \n88.  PGB will support and encourage public-private partnerships in the sharing and utilization \nof resources of TEVT institutions, such as management of production and service centers; \ndelivery  of  nonformal  livelihood  training  programs;  operation  of  second  shifts  in  TEVT \ninstitutions; and establishment of DACs and provision of seed money to DACs, IMCs, and \nCMCs.  \n \nB.   Conditions of Loan Effectiveness \n \n89.  The project director for the DOE PMU and project director for the DOLM PMU with \nqualifications, experience, and expertise acceptable to ADB, will be selected and appointed on a \ncompetitive basis. \n   ", "20  \n \n90.

General Education \n \n1.  General  education  in  Pakistan  can  be  divided  into  elementary,  secondary,  higher \nsecondary, and higher education. Elementary education can be further subdivided into primary \n(grades 1\u20135) and middle levels (grades 6\u20138). Secondary comprises grades 6\u201310 and higher \nsecondary grades 11\u201312. A baccalaureate in general science or humanities takes another 2 \nyears  after  the  higher  secondary  school  certificate  making  a  total  of  14  years,  whereas \nprograms on engineering and medicine take longer. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Education at the federal level is responsible for policy, planning and \noverall educational standards. It also has control over the curriculum for grades 1\u201312. The \nprovincial department of education is responsible for education in each province. Recently, \nunder the devolution plan, responsibility for education was devolved to the districts where the \nexecutive district officer for education is responsible for supervision and promotion of education.  \n   \nB.  Technical Education and Vocational Training \n \n3.  Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) in Pakistan can be divided into \nthree subcomponents: prevocational or school level, technical education, and vocational training \n(TEVT), and higher engineering and technology education. The history of the introduction and \nintegration of prevocational and vocational courses into the general school education dates \nback to the early 1950s and many experiments have been conducted. However, these efforts \nhaven\u2019t had a significant impact on general school education, which from the period of colonial \nrule was geared toward producing clerks and other office workers rather than technicians, \nengineers, and scientists. The education policy of 1972\u201380 suggested a major shift from general \neducation  and  emphasized  relating  education  to  the  world  of  work.  This  resulted  in  the \nintroduction of agro-technical studies (wood work, metal work, and electricity), agriculture, and \nhome economics in urban, rural, and girls\u2019 middle schools respectively in grades 6\u20138. In grades \n9\u201310 introduction of vocational courses of various groups such as agriculture, commerce, home \neconomics, and industrial arts was encouraged. More recently, this approach is reaffirmed \nunder the National Education Policy and Education Sector Reform Program. \n \n4.  The rapid growth of the TEVT subsector is due to the Government\u2019s desire to increase \naccess of rural youths and women to technical education and vocational training to improve \ntheir job skills and means of livelihood. The lack of places in the universities also led to \nexpansion of the subsector, as it became an alternative channel for youth and school leavers. \nThis  resulted  in  the  social  demand  for  more  opportunities  for  and  access  to  TEVT.  The \nGovernment assumed the main responsibility of providing TEVT to youths with little participation \nof the private sector. Only during the last few years has there been a growing trend toward \nencouraging participation of the private sector in TEVT provision. Under the Education Sector \nReforms Program, a number of incentive schemes have been introduced to enlist private sector \nparticipation in education and training. \n \n5.  Vocational Training. Vocational training caters to unemployed youths who lack skills \nand those who either drop out of the school system or fail to qualify for admission in the \npolytechnic institutes and colleges. Expansion in vocational training took place during 1980\u2013\n1990, and included establishing several training centers and upgrading a number of old ones \nacross the country. The Ministry of Youth Affairs also established 20 youth vocational centers. \nThe expansion of vocational training and the establishment of national and provincial training \n ", "26  Appendix 3   \nboards took place through the promulgation of the National Training Ordinance in 1980. This \nalso emphasized qualitative improvement in vocational training, initiation of training programs \nfor  women  in  nontraditional  trades,  and  closer  involvement  of  employers  in  planning  and \nadministration of vocational training.   \n   \n6.  The duration as well as entry qualifications for different vocational training programs vary \nwidely. Training programs range from a few weeks to 2 years and entry qualifications vary from \nmiddle to secondary school pass. Vocational courses are more practically oriented compared \nwith technical education. The curriculum of vocational courses comprises 80% practical and \n20% theory. Graduates are expected to perform semiskilled and skilled jobs in various sectors \nor can be self- employed. \n \n7.  There are only 11 technical and vocational training centers (TVTCs) in 10 of the 26 \ndistricts in Balochistan, the largest province in physical size, offering training in 19 trades. The \ntraining centers operate under the aegis of the Department of Labor and Manpower (DOLM). \nThe duration of courses varies from 4 weeks to 12 months. Enrollments in the 11 public training \ncenters during the 2001\u20132002 session in both regular and evening programs totaled around \n1,300 trainees. In addition, 294 trainees enrolled in short courses offered at the TVTC in Quetta, \nthe women\u2019s TVTC in Quetta, and the TVTC in Khuzdar. Of the 11 training centers, only 1 is for \nfemales.  In  addition,  23  private  training  institutions  offer  mainly  computer  training  and are \nregistered with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE). \n \n8.  Technical Education. Technical education refers to postsecondary school training of \nmiddle level supervisory technicians carried out in polytechnic institutes. These technicians \nserve as a link between engineers and technologists and the skilled and semiskilled workers \nbelow. The rapid growth of the TEVT subsector was the result of the Government\u2019s desire to \nincrease access of rural youth and women to technical education and vocational training to \nimprove their job skills and means of livelihood. The lack of places in the universities also led to \nexpansion of the subsector, as it became an alternative channel for youth and school leavers. \nThis resulted in the social demand for more opportunities for and access to TEVT.  \n \n9.  A 3-year course leading to diploma of associate engineer (DAE) is the main program of \nthe polytechnic institutes in the country. The DAE curriculum comprises 60% practical and 40% \ntheory. The polytechnic institutes offer a wide range of training programs in traditional as well as \nnew and emerging technologies. While the number of technologies offered in various institutions \nin other three provinces ranges from one in the case of monotechnic institutes and up to eight in \nbigger polytechnics, there are only two polytechnics in Balochistan (one for boys and one for \ngirls) with over 1,000 students enrolled. The polytechnic institute for women in Quetta was \nestablished only in 2002 under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Technical Education \nProject. For a province with over 7 million people, this is considered inadequate and compares \nvery unfavorably with other provinces. \n \n10.  The persistent demand of DAE holders for the extension of facilities to higher education \nin the field of technology resulted in the introduction in late 1970s of a baccalaureate degree in \ntechnology, with a uniform pattern throughout the country. The baccalaureate program (pass \ncourse) takes 2 years, 1 year on-the-job experience and 1 year teaching for DAE holders; and \nthe  honors  baccalaureate  is  also  2  years,  again  one  year  on-the-job  training  and  1  year \nschooling, for those who passed the pass course). To offer the baccalaureate program, a \nnumber  of  polytechnic  institutes  were  upgraded  to  the  level  of  college  of  technology.  In \nBalochistan, the polytechnic institute for males was also upgraded to offer the program. This \ninitiative is considered important for two reasons: (i) to provide some opportunities to DAE \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \ngraduates to get further training, and (ii) to upgrade qualification of DAE teachers given that \nabout 50% have only DAE qualification. \n \nC.  Governance, Structure, and Management of TEVT \n \n11.  The TEVT system lacks operational integrity as a system. The components of TEVT \nwere  divided  and  dispersed  to  become  separate  and  uncoordinated  functions  of  many \norganizations.  Traditionally,  technical  education  was  placed  under  the  responsibility  of  the \nprovincial and district education departments, while vocational training was with the directorate \nof human resources training under DOLM. As a result, policy of training was duplicated, and  \nplanning and monitoring were poor. The merging of TEVT into a single system has become an \ninternational benchmark in addressing the paradigm shift in human resource development. Over \nthe past 10 years a major realignment of TEVT systems of Asia Pacific countries has occurred \nas  a  human  resource  management  strategy  of  globalization.  This  international  trend  and \nrealization internally, has led to changes in Pakistan as well. Much progress has been made \nrecently  in  Punjab  with  the  initiative  of  the  Punjab  government  to  establish  the  Technical \nEducation and Vocational Training Authority, responsible for all training programs under a \ncorporate  structure.  The  North-West  Frontier  Province  is  moving  in  this  direction,  while \nBalochistan and Sindh are watching this development carefully. \n \n12.  In Balochistan, the TEVT system is not integrated into one body. Technical education is \nattached to the Directorate of Colleges, Higher, and Technical Education under the Department \nof Education, while technical and vocational training is provided by the 11 TVTCs under the \nDMT, which in turn is under DOLM. The organization of the TEVT system was not affected by \nthe devolution plan and TEVT institutions lack autonomy. Although the provincial government of \nBalochistan  (PGB)  intends  to  establish  a  directorate  of  technical  education  under  the \nDepartment of Education to manage and organize technical education, a plan to merge all \nTEVT institutions under one institution similar to the North-West Frontier Province is also being \ndiscussed. \n \nD.  Demand and Supply of Skilled Workers and Technicians \n \n13.  Traditionally  most  TEVT  institutions,  particularly  the  polytechnic  institutes,  were \nestablished to train the workforce for Government departments and public sector organizations \nwhere their qualifications (certificate/diplomas) served as proof of competence. Until recently \nvery little attempt has been made to involve the end users in the operation, management, and \nprogram delivery, and to align the course contents to the needs of industries. This failure has \ncontributed to the marginalization of TEVT institutions with employers showing little interest in \nextending cooperation to the institutions due to lack of interactions between industries and \nTEVT institutions. Consequently, TEVT programs are seen as out of step with the needs and \nexpectations of the workplace. \n \n14.  A  labor  market  survey  conducted  in  2003  under  an  advisory  technical  assistance \nsupported by ADB provided important implications for the TEVT system. First, the graduates \nidentified a lack of industrial training skills and inadequate practical content as a key weakness \nof  the  TEVT  programs,  followed  by  shortage  of  equipment,  insufficient  consumables  and \nlearning materials, and poorly prepared teachers. Consistent with this observation, the majority \nof the enterprises rated practical skills, troubleshooting, report writing and communication skills, \nand  safety  consciousness  as  poor.  Graduates  who  got  employment  had  to  undergo  an \nadditional 3 months of training by their employers. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3   \n15.  Second, the survey indicated that the annual future demand for skilled workers and \ntechnicians  as  high  in  electrical,  mechanical,  electronics,  computer  and  information,  and \ntelecommunications; and as moderate in civil and construction, auto and diesel, refrigeration \nand air-conditioning, plastic, rubber, and petroleum trades and technologies. \n \n16.  Third, the survey indicated that there is mismatch of skills between those imparted in \nTEVT institutions and those required by the industry, which may be associated with lack of \ntimely updating of curriculum, lack of teachers with appropriate expertise, or shortage of funds. \nThis may also be due to an inflexible training system, which is difficult to change to meet the \nneeds of the labor market. The mismatch also comes from gaps in the competencies imparted \nby the TEVT institutions and those demanded by the industry, such as lack of skills in practical \naspects, troubleshooting, report writing, and communication.   \n \nE.  Key Issues and Challenges in TEVT \n \n17.  The analysis of the TEVT system vis-\u00e0-vis the emerging needs of the economy indicates \nseveral areas for improvement. First, consolidation of TEVT programs is urgently needed to \nensure that existing programs are organized and managed effectively in response to emerging \nlabor market needs, both for the local and international markets. Second, given that Balochistan \nhas very limited opportunities for TEVT due to limited involvement of the private sector, PGB \nneeds to make targeted investments to expand and improve TEVT quality, particularly for \nwomen and rural poor. PGB needs to play a strategic role to ensure an effective and responsive \nTEVT  system  through  policy  reforms,  regulation,  targeted  investments,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation; and providing a greater role for nongovernment organizations and private sector, \nwhich  is  in  line  with  the  national  education  policy,  education  sector  reform,  and  poverty \nreduction strategy paper. Third, PGB regulatory function needs to ensure application of core \nprinciples such as linkages with industry, practical orientation of TEVT programs, provision of \nlabor  market  information  and  counseling  services  to  TEVT  students  and  graduates, \nperformance-based management to target funds, and greater flexibility to introduce changes in \nteaching and learning in response to emerging labor market needs. Finally, providing greater \noperational autonomy to TEVT institutions to plan and manage their programs effectively is very \nimportant. This approach promotes effective leadership and performance-based management \nand allows TEVT providers to become more responsive and competitive.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  29 \nLESSONS LEARNED \n \nLessons Learned  Incorporations of the Lessons in Project Design \n   \nProject Design and Processing   \n   \n1.

National Education Policy \n \n1.  The National Education Policy (NEP), 1998\u20132010, stipulates 19 policy provisions for \ntechnical  education  and  vocational  training  (TEVT).  These  serve  as  a  framework  for  the \ndevelopment of the TEVT subsector in Pakistan. These policy provisions can be further grouped \ninto  seven  policy  areas;  namely,  (i)  improving  planning,  management,  coordination,  and \ninstitutional development; (ii) encouraging need-based and performance based- funding, cost \nrecovery  for  self\u2013reliance,  and  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  TEVT;  (iii) \nstrengthening evaluation, examinations, and accreditation of TEVT programs and institutions; \n(iv) improving the skills and qualification of teachers through in-service training and provision of \nliberal in-service training facilities for teachers; (v) regular revising and upgrading curricula, \nintroducing emerging technologies including computer education as a compulsory component of \nthe curriculum of technical education, introducing a modular approach to provide continuing \neducation in TEVT, and developing teaching-learning resource materials by TEVT teachers; (vi) \nincreasing  equity  and  access  to  TEVT  by  establishing  new  institutions,  providing  distance \neducation  and  continuing  education,  broadening  the  base  for  TEVT  by  introducing  a  new \ntechnical stream for students (technical) and extending opportunities for further education for \nTEVT  graduates;  and  (vii)  improving  quality  of  TEVT  by  refurbishing  and  modernizing \nlaboratories, workshops, and training equipment. \n \nB.  Policy Reform Proposed under the Project \n \n2.  These  policy  stipulations  have  direct  implications  for  the development  of  the  TEVT \nsystem within the scope of the Project. In particular, the Project will adopt the strategy of \n\u201cqualitative improvement and modest quantitative expansion in strategic areas\u201d in order to \nachieve the seven key objectives for TEVT as outlined in the NEP. These objectives are (i) to \nexpand opportunities for TEVT in the province to produce trained human resources to meet the \nemerging needs of industry, (ii) to improve the quality of TEVT to enhance the employability of \nTEVT graduates, (iii) to design TEVT programs that serve the dual purpose of self-employment \nand providing trained human resources for industry, (iv) to provide relevant technical skills and \ndesirable work ethics among the students through innovative measures, (v) to establish an \nevaluation  system  that  emphasizes  practical  skills  and  project  orientation,  (vi)  to  promote \ninstitution-industry  linkages,  and  (vii)  to  impart  employable  skills  to  reduce  unemployment \namong educated youth through nonformal livelihood training programs. \n \n3.  In addition to the Government\u2019s policy stipulations, other policy implications from the \nProject have been incorporated in the framework. For example, resource considerations for \nachieving these policies should be incorporated. The target for higher budgetary allocation by \nmid-term as a percentage of allocations to TEVT will be (carefully studied) and reflected as \nappropriate. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \n \nTable A6: Policy Reform under the Project \n \nGovernment\u2019s Policies on  Policy Reform Proposed in  Actions to be taken by \nTEVT Subsector  Project Design  Government \n     \n1.

The project scope covers two government agencies in Balochistan: \nDepartment  of  Education  (DOE)  for  technical  education  and  Department  of  Labor  and \nManpower (DOLM) for technical and vocational training. As Executing Agency for the Project, \nthe Planning and Development Department will develop a steering committee to coordinate and \nfacilitate DOE and DOLM project implementation activities.  \n \n2.  Steering Committee. The Executing Agency will be the Planning and Development \nDepartment. A steering committee headed by the additional chief secretary of the Planning and \nDevelopment Department has been established, comprising secretaries of DOE, DOLM, and \ndepartments of fisheries and finance; chief economist and chief of foreign aid at the Planning \nand Development Department; and two representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and \nthe  districts  of  Gwadar  and  Khuzdar,  to  coordinate  policy  reform,  address  implementation \nbottlenecks, and provide overall guidance. The steering committee will meet at least quarterly to \nreview project implementation.  \n \n3.  Implementing  Agencies.  DOE  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for \ntechnician education (polytechnics) and DOLM the Implementing Agency for technical and \nvocational training. DOE was the executing agency for the recently closed Technical Education \nProject, and the Directorate of Manpower Training under the DOLM received 13 years of \nsupport from the German Technical Assistance Agency. As a result, both have mechanisms for \nfinancial management and reporting. \n \n4.  Project Management Unit. A project management unit (PMU) will be established under \neach implementing agency. Each PMU will be headed by a project director recruited from the \nmarket  on  a  competitive  basis.  Each  project  director  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of the Project in close collaboration with the recipient institutions. Other staff of \nthe  PMU  will  comprise  procurement  officer,  accounts/disbursement  officer,  monitoring  and \nevaluation officer, and support staff. To ensure continuity and smooth implementation of project \nactivities,  experienced  and  relevant  project  implementation  unit  staff  under  the  Technical \nEducation Project will be retained in the PMU as appropriate. \n \n5.  To  ensure  continuity  and  efficiency  in  project  implementation  each  project  director \nrecruited from the market will sign an agreement with the Government committing to stay with \nthe Project for at least 3 years. If the project director must be replaced due to unsatisfactory \nperformance, the Planning and Development Department will seek the concurrence of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to replace the individual through a competitive procedure.  \n \n6.  Funding Mechanisms and Conditions. Funding mechanisms and release of project \nresources  for  financing  of  certain  types  of  programs  and  activities  under  the  Project  are \ncontingent upon satisfactory completion of prior conditions and requirements. This is to ensure \nthat project funds are utilized effectively toward achievement of project activities under each \ncomponent. The following guidelines will apply to funding mechanisms and conditions for such \nprograms and activities. \n \n(i)  The  concerned  project  institutions  must  prepare  a  5-year  institutional \ndevelopment plan for consideration by the provincial government of Balochistan \n(PGB) and ADB. Such a plan will include, at a minimum, the following items: (i) \nphilosophy of the institution; (ii) vision and mission; (iii) development objectives \nfor the next 5 years in terms of programs and services to offer to the clients; (iii) \ntarget  and  indicators  in  terms  of  enrollments,  pass  and  dropout  rates, \nemployment of graduates, and number of teaching and nonteaching staff; (iv) \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \nfinancial  development  plan  including  revenue  generation,  investments,  and \nsavings; (v) staff development plan, (vi) maintenance programs for buildings and \nequipment; (vii) social marketing of the institution, programs, and its students and \ngraduates;  (viii)  development  and  maintenance  of  management  information \nsystem;  (ix)  physical    infrastructure  development  plan  (i.e.,  new  buildings, \nexpansion  of  existing  facilities,  rehabilitation  of  laboratories,  workshops);  (x) \nequipment repair, maintenance, and replacement plan; (xi) number of teaching \nstaff and the qualifications required for the existing or new programs; (xii) job \nplacement plan and activities for graduates; (xii) forecast of annual budgets and \nexpenditures for the next 5 years; and (xiii) implementation schedules.  \n(ii)  After the plans have been reviewed and endorsed, with any necessary revisions, \nby  the  PMU,  directorate  of  technical  education  (DTE)  and  directorate  of \nmanpower training (DMT), they will be submitted to ADB for concurrence.  \n(iii)  After ADB concurrence with the institutional development plans, the institutions \nwill start implementing their plans in phases. For each phase, the money will be \nreleased through the PGB and PMU to finance the activities in accordance with \nthe approved schedules and sequence. \n(iv)  As a general rule, funds for construction work will not be released until sanction \nor notification from the PGB has been obtained for the creation, financing, and \nappointment of staff; acquisition of land rights; completion of blue print for the \nbuilding; installation of electricity, water, and other utilities; etc. Only after these \nand  other  related  items,  programs,  or  activities  have  been  completed  and \nconfirmed by the Planning and Development Department will the project funds be \nreleased to finance construction work. \n(v)  The progress of programs and activities under the institutional development plan \nwill be closely monitored and reviewed by the DTE and DMT, with the assistance \nof the PMU, every 6 months, coinciding with semiannual reviews. If progress is \nfound unsatisfactory during the reviews, funds will be suspended until corrective \nactions  have  been  taken  to  improve  the  situation  and  expedite  the \nimplementation process. \n(vi)  Each  recipient  institution  will  prepare  an  annual  report,  which  describes  the \nprogress and results of implementation activities, as well as outputs, benefits, \nimpacts,  assistance  needed,  and  problems  that  need  to  be  resolved  in  the \nfollowing year for submission to the DTE, DMT, and ADB. \n(vii)  This process will continue until the last year of the institutional development plan. \nIn  the  last year,  each recipient institution  will  start  preparing  another  5-year \ndevelopment plan as a rolling plan for the institution. The plan will be used as the \nbasis  for  budget  allocation  to  the  institution  in  conjunction  with  the \nimplementation  of  the  performance-based  management  system  to  be \nimplemented under the Project. \n(viii)  TEVT institutions will receive support under a management contract to prepare \nan institutional development plan and to strengthen institutional management \nthrough management development programs. \n(ix)  For nonformal livelihood training programs, nongovernment organizations/private \norganizations  will  be  encouraged/required  to  implement  training  programs  at \nvarious communities based on the results of the needs analysis and employment \nopportunities in the targeted communities. Nongovernment organizations with 5 \nyears of relevant experience in Balochistan and with the provincial government \nwill be selected based on their proposals. \n ", "  Appendix 9  39 \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \nYear I Year II Year III Year IV Year V Year VI\nComponent/Activities\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n1.

Economic Rational. Pakistan has 562 public technical education and vocational training \n(TEVT)  institutions  that  are  unevenly  distributed  across  the  provinces.  About  85%  are \nconcentrated in Punjab and Sindh, and the remaining 15% are shared by North-West Frontier \nProvince (NWFP) and Balochistan. The average size of a TEVT institution in each province \nvaries substantially from one province to another. As the population-TEVT institution ratio in \nTable A14.1 indicates, one TEVT institution is built for every 311,000 in Punjab, 142,000 in \nSindh, and 266,000 in NWFP. However, in Balochistan, one TEVT institution is available for \nevery 535,000 people. When private TEVT institutions are included, Balochistan lags even \nfurther behind the other three provinces.  \n \nTable A14.1: Distribution of Population and TEVT Institutions in Pakistan \n \nItem  Pakistan  Punjab  Sindh  NWFP  Balochistan \nPopulation (\u2018000)    136,372    78,387    32,104    18,925    6,956 \nTEVT Institution     562    252    226    71    13 \nPolytechnics    77    25    37    12    2 \nTVTCs    253    109    95    38    11 \nOther    232    118    94    21    \u2014 \nPopulation-TEVT \nInstitution Ratio (A/B)    242,000    311,000   142,000  266,000    535,000 \n\u2014  =  not available. \nNWFP = North-West Frontier Province, TEVT = technical education and vocational training, TVTC = technical \nand vocational training center. \nSource: ADB. 2003. Skills Development Reform Project. Manila (TA 4149-PAK). \n \n2.  The problems of Balochistan\u2019s TEVT sector are not only confined to the distribution and \nnumber  of  institutions,  but  include  poor  efficiency  of  TEVT  institutions.  In  Balochistan, \napproximately 350 enterprises are currently operating and three new industrial estates are \nunder construction. The market survey7 revealed that the new industrial estates would result in \nmore demand for technicians and skilled/semiskilled workers.8 However, the supply of labor \nforce is insufficient. The two polytechnics and 11 technical and vocational training centers \n(TVTCs)  are  located  in  areas  remote  from  the  new  industrial  estates.  Enrollment  in  the \npolytechnics  exceeds  the  intake  capacity  by  approximately  310%.  Overcrowded  classes, \noutdated facilities and equipment, and inexperienced teachers inevitably result in lower quality \nof education, is reflected in the low completion rate of approximately 30\u201340%. The situation in \nTVTCs is much better with completion rates at over 75%. \n \n3.  The insufficient physical capacity of TEVT institutions, high internal inefficiency as a \nresult of low quality of TEVT, and high external inefficiency due insufficient skill level warrant the \nnecessity for interventions through further investment in the TEVT sector. As Table A14.2 \nindicates, while more TEVT institutions are in private sector, more students and trainees were \nenrolled in the public sector in 2001. On average, one TEVT institution in the public sector \nenrolls more students and trainees than in the private sector, making the public sector more \nefficient. Also, in the absence of private polytechnics, the government must invest in public \n                                                 \n7  Asian Development Bank. 2003.

Skills Development Reform Project. Manila (TA 4149-PAK). \n \n4.  Consideration of Design Alternatives. The Project faced mainly two options: either to \nsupport a large-scale expansion given the Government\u2019s ambitious plan of providing access to \nTEVT at the district and tehsil levels, or to focus more on ensuring effective functioning of \nexisting facilities before embarking on a large-scale expansion. While support for large-scale \nexpansion would be in line with the Government\u2019s policy stipulation under the perspective plan \n2001\u20132011 and education sector reform (2001\u20132005), and would receive big buy-in from the \nprovincial  government  of  Balochistan  (PGB),  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  sustain  such  an \napproach due to limited budgets available for essential recurrent expenditures and lack of \neffective models of TEVT institutions. The Project has therefore taken a middle path of cautious \nexpansion with a strong emphasis on consolidating existing TEVT institutions. Some expansion \nis necessary as Balochistan lags Punjab and Sindh significantly in terms of access to TEVT, \nparticularly among women and the rural poor. The balance between cautious expansion and \nconsolidation allows PGB to improve the quality and efficiency of existing TEVT institutions with \nlimited expansion in the most viable towns and districts, focusing on women and rural poor. \n \n5.  An investment loan modality is proposed since PGB is not yet ready to embark on a \nmore complex design. Given the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the \ntwo previous projects for TEVT, addressing the persisting problems that inflict the TEVT sector \nis important. First, a project approach allows a simple design with a strong emphasis on policy \nreform. Second, efforts across Pakistan to bring TEVT institutions under one organization will be \nsupported. Punjab is leading in this effort through its effort to bring all TEVT activities under the \ntechnical education and vocational training authority and other provinces are watching this \ndevelopment  closely.  PGB  is  also  considering  merging  technical  education  under  the \nDepartment  of  Education  and  technical  and  vocational  training  under  the  Department  of \nIndustries. Third, the devolution policy is affecting many government services, but has not yet \naffected TEVT provision. Therefore, a conducive environment is needed for PGB to allow \ngreater autonomy to TEVT institutions and TEVT institutions to prepare to assume greater \nresponsibilities to become more competitive and responsive to labor market needs. Finally, \nsome of the fundamental elements necessary to enhance the effectiveness of TEVT institutions \nsuch as public-private partnership, counseling services, and exposure of teachers to industries \ncan be achieved under a relatively simple investment loan. \n \n ", "Appendix 14  51\n6.  The Project is designed to achieve consolidation with cautious expansion. The first \ncomponent of institutional development is key to enhancing the capacity of TEVT institutions to \nbecome more responsive to labor market needs through greater autonomy, performance-based \nmanagement,  and  management  development  programs.  The  second  component  supports \nquality enhancement through training of teachers and competency-based training (CBT), which \nis already supported by the National Institute for Science and Technical Education, an apex \nbody assigned to upgrade qualifications of TEVT teachers. CBT will also allow training to be \naligned  with  the  needs  of  the  private  sector  and  industries.  The  Project  also  provides \nappropriate materials to support this approach. The third component supports access and equity \nby establishing equivalency and certification, which will benefit many people who have had \nexperience and training and want recognition either to get further training or to seek better \npaying jobs. This component also provides opportunities to out-of-school youth and adults to \nseek livelihood training appropriate to their employment needs. With limited support to new \ninstitutions,  access  to  polytechnics  and  technical  and  vocational  training  centers  will  be \nenhanced. \n \n7.  Economic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the economic viability and efficiency of \nthe investment under the Project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 25 years was \nestimated. Three major streams of economic benefits of the proposed project are identified, \nnamely  (i)  increased  access  to  TEVT  institutions,  (ii)  improved  internal  efficiency,  and  (iii) \nimproved external efficiency. The impacts of the three educational improvements are presented \nin  monetary  values  by  utilizing  estimated  future  salary  increments9  of  TEVT  students  and \ntrainees as a result of completing an additional year of TEVT under the Project. \n \n8.  Increase  in  access  is  represented  by  enrollment  growth  resulting  from  the  newly \nestablished  TEVT  institutions,  technologies,  training  programs,  and  courses.  The  Project \ncreates additional intake capacity in the TEVT sector: 1,200 additional annual enrollees in \npolytechnics,  700  in  TVTCs  and  colleges,  and  4,000  in  short-term  training  courses  and \nprograms. The students in polytechnics and TVTCs learn better skills and appropriate ethos as \na future workforce within a year, giving them an assumed increase in their annual earning of \n$83 throughout their working lives. Similarly, the trainees in short courses will have increments \nof $9 to their salary throughout their working lives. \n \n9.  Improvement in internal efficiency is measured by the difference in completion rates of \npolytechnics between with- and without-project scenarios, based on an assumption that the \nnewly designed courses and better institutional management will have a positive impact on the \neffectiveness of delivery of education and training, and hence result in a better completion rate. \nDuring the Project, the completion rate in polytechnics is estimated to improve by approximately \n20%, gradually from 46% to 55%. The full completion of 1-year polytechnics education is \nassumed to increase annual earnings by $83 throughout the graduates\u2019 working lives. \n \n10.  Improved external efficiency is measured by the difference in employment rate of the \ngraduates and completers of TEVT between the with- and without-project scenario based on the \nassumption that that new educational contents, new institutional management system, and \ncounseling  guidance  will  create  more  opportunities  for  employments.  Currently,  70%  of \ngraduates and completers cannot obtain a job immediately after graduation and completion, and \nhave to wait for approximately 2 years to be employed. During the Project, the employment rate \nof the graduates and completers is expected to rise gradually from 30% to 60%. In other words, \n                                                 \n9 Earning level was estimated by using earning functions developed by Zafar Mueen Nasir and Hina Nazli in \nEducation and Earnings in Pakistan, Research Report No. 177, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. \n2000. The function indicates that a secondary school pupil will receive an average increment of $83 per year \nthroughout his/her working life by studying an additional year in an educational institution at between the ages of 18 \nand 20. \n ", " 52  Appendix 14 \nthe Project saves 30% of graduates and completers from human resource wastage each year \nand allows them to generate income for the economy. The saving of a polytechnic graduate, a \nTVTC completer, and a nonformal livelihood training completer from human resource wastage \nbenefits the economy by $2,815, $2,454, and $458 per year respectively. \n \n11.  The three major streams of economic costs are (i) investment cost of the Project, (ii) \nrecurrent cost, and (iii) private and opportunity costs. The cost of the Project is estimated at \n$39.7 million. Recurrent cost is represented per pupil, which is necessary for operation and \nmaintenance of the TEVT institutions established by the Project. Per capita recurrent cost is \nestimated at $263 for a polytechnics student, $123 for a TVTC trainee, and $10 for a short-term \ntraining program trainee. Private cost includes the out-of-pocket expenses of students and \ntrainees necessary to continue TEVT and is estimated at $33 per year.10 Opportunity cost is \nequivalent to the income that a student or trainee would otherwise receive if he/she does not \nstudy in TEVT institution. Opportunity cost is estimated at $1,145 for both a polytechnics student \nand a TVTC trainee. Private cost and opportunity cost of a short-term training program trainee \nare assumed to be zero, since locally provided training does not incur considerable private cost \nand the majority of the trainees are likely to be unemployed. \n \n12.  The Project is estimated to yield a net present value of $13 million assuming a discount \nrate of 12.0% and an EIRR of 12.9%. The summary result is presented in Table A14.3. The \nactual EIRR is likely to be somewhat higher reflecting positive externalities and longer term \nintergenerational social benefits that come with improved TEVT, which may be reflected through \npositive parental attitudes to children\u2019s education and diligent work ethics, to which assigning \nmonetary values is difficult. No allowance is made for the fact that the improvements in TEVT \nwill encourage students and trainees to have higher esteem and wider exposure to different \ntechnologies and skills, which lead to better performance and productivity in the labor market. \n \n13.  A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the basis of alternative assumptions regarding \nthe extent to which the project achieves improved access, and internal and external efficiency. \nThe Project\u2019s targets for the respective three improvements are 5,900 additional enrollment11 \nper year, 55% in completion, and 60% in employment rate. For an analytical purpose, the \nalternative  assumptions  were  tested  by  employing  extreme  values,  in  that  the  low  case \nrepresents the degree of improvement in respective areas and would be 50% lower than the \ntarget, and the high case 50 % higher. In other words, in the low case, the target for additional \nenrollment, the completion rates and the employment rate of graduates/completers are reduced \nto 2,950, 51% and 45% respectively, while for the high case, they are increased to 8,850, 60%, \nand 75% respectively. The results are shown in Table A14.4. \n \n14.  The results indicate that the Project will bring substantial benefits to the economy when \nimprovement in the three areas exceeds the targets. However, an excessive increase in access \nmay  replicate  the  current  situation  where  the  enrolment  exceeds  the  capacity,  and  hence \novercrowded classes result in lower quality of education and training. The results also indicate \nthat the Project is highly sensitive to access and external efficiency. A small decline in the \ndegree of improvement in access and external efficiency could render the Project economically \nnonviable. The calculation indicates that the Project must at least achieve 97% of the targeted \nincrease in access. New construction of polytechnics and TVTCs in the industrial areas under \nthe Project and utilization of double shift classes will contribute to achieving the minimum target. \nSimilarly, the degree of improvement in internal and external efficiency must be more than 75% \nand 87% respectively. The modest minimum target is likely to be achieved through the provision \n                                                 \n10 Qureshi, Sarfraz K. and G. M. Arif. 2001.

Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n15.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  providing  youth  with  more \nopportunities to receive wages in the labor market in the future through a series of training, \nguidance, and job placement programs. The direct beneficiaries of the Project are students and \ntrainees in polytechnics, TVTCs, and training programs. The poverty line in Pakistan is based \non  a  caloric  norm  of  2,530  calories  per  adult  daily  equivalent  and  minimum  nonfood \nrequirements; it approximates $160 per year12. Based on the earning simulation, completion of 1 \nyear of training in TVTCs is estimated to bring about $166 more salary per year than for those \nwithout training. Similarly, completion of 3-year technical education in polytechnics is likely to \nbring about $500 more salary than those without equivalent education would receive. Thus, the \nsalary increments as a result of completion of polytechnic education and training programs in \nTVTC, coupled with successful employment in the labor market, will increase earning level well \nabove the poverty line. \n \n16.  In  the  absence  of  statistical  data  on  the  poverty  profile  of  students  and  trainees, \nassumed the proportion of students and trainees from poor families are assumed to be at least \nthe same as the proportion of the poor in the province. Also, the current student selection \nprocedures in polytechnics and the geographical distribution of TVTCs are assumed to reflect \nthe  rural  and  urban  distribution  of  the  provincial  population  in  enrolment.  Based  on  the \nassumptions, approximately 24% of students and trainees are assumed to be from urban areas \nand 76% from rural areas in 1999; poverty incidence is estimated at 28% and 24% for urban \nand rural regions in 2001. Thus approximately 25\u201326% of the students and trainees are likely to \nbe from poor families (Table A14.6). \n \nTable A14.5: Population and Poverty in Balochistan \n(%) \n \nItem  Regions  Provincial \n  Urban  Rural   Total \nPopulation (A)  23.9  76.1  100.0 \nPoverty Incidence in Region (B)  28.4  24.6   \nPoverty Incidence in Province (AxB)  6.8  18.7  25.5 \nSources:  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2003.

The provincial poverty reduction strategy of Balochistan notes that the poverty incidence \nfigure for Balochistan is \u201clargely a statistical aberration\u201d, and if the past trends had continued, \npoverty would have risen to 41.3% in 1998/99. The estimated poverty incidence figure for the \nstudents and trainees in polytechnics and TVTCs could be, however, underestimated for three \nreasons. Firstly, the historical trends of poverty incidence in other studies suggest that the \npoverty incidence in Balochistan has been increasing and, therefore, the figure in the project \ncommencement year is likely to be much higher than 26%. Secondly, the provincial poverty \nreduction strategy of Balochistan notes that the poverty incidence figure for Balochistan is \n\u201clargely a statistical aberration\u201d, and if the past trends had continued, poverty would have risen \nto 41.3% in 1998/99. Thirdly, applicants to TEVT programs are more likely to be from poorer \nfamilies than those applying to general education, as financial difficulties and lack of family \nsupport for education generally make it difficult for children to be successful in the general \neducation stream and eventually resort to TEVT as their second life option. \n \n                                                 \n12  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2003.

The  TEVT  sector  is  financed  under  both  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  and \nDepartment of Labor and Manpower (DOLM) of PGB. DOE administers a college of technology \nand a polytechnic institute, while DOLM administers TVTCs and nonformal training programs. \nBoth DOE and DOLM received a constant proportion of the provincial budget, approximately \n17% and 1% respectively between fiscal year (FY)2001 and FY2003. In FY2004, however, as a \nresult of administrative and financial devolution in PGB, the DOE budget was substantially \nreduced because the majority of the DOE recurrent budget, mainly for staff salary and operation \nand maintenance of line institutions and agencies, which was previously allocated through DOE \nto education institutions, is now directly allocated to the district governments13. \n \nTable A14.6: Education, Labor, and Human Resources Budget FY2001\u20132004 \n(PRs million) \n \nItem  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004 \nBalochistan Provincial Government    32,087    30,446    34,934    43,954 \n Development Budget    6,573     4,096     6,467     9,300  \n Recurrent Budget    25,514     26,350     28,467     34,653  \n  Department of Education    4,376     5,242     6,079     2,346  \n  Proportion to Government Expenditure (%)    14    17    17    5 \n   Development Budget    431     431     1,234     1,174  \n   Recurrent Budget    3,945     4,811     4,845     1,172  \n  Department of Labor and Manpower     92     109     139     192  \n  Proportion to Government Expenditure (%)    0    0    1    1 \n  Development Budget    3     3     32     58  \n  Recurrent Budget    88     106     107     134  \nFY = fiscal year. \nNote:    Due to limited availability of budget records, the recurrent budget figures are from original budget and \ndevelopment budget figures from revised budget. \nSource:  Finance Department, Provincial Government of Balochistan. \n \n \n19.  Despite  the  devolution,  PGB  still  directly  allocates  the  recurrent  budget  to  TEVT \ninstitutions. The total recurrent budget in TEVT sector in FY2004 is RPs147 million and a large \nproportion of the budget is from DOLM. The sector budget has been generally increasing by \nmore than 10% annually for the last 4 financial years. The annual budget increase was a result \nof three factors (i) general increase in budget each year, (ii) the transfer of the Directorate of \nManpower Training from the Industries Department to DOLM in 2004, and (iii) funding for a \npolytechnic institute in FY2003 under DOE. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 PGB was unable to provide the appraisal mission with the total education budget of the province, which includes \nthe budget allocated to provincial and district governments. \n ", " 56  Appendix 14 \n \nTable A14.7: Recurrent Budget for TEVT Sectors FY2001\u20132004 \n(PRs million) \nItem  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004 \nDepartment of Education         \n    Colleges of Technology    14    13    21    28 \n Polytechnic Institute    0    0    8    7 \nSubtotal    14    13    29    35 \nDepartment of Manpower and Labor Management         \n    Manpower Directorate    0    6    10    12 \n    Technical Training Centers    67    70    84    100 \nSubtotal    67    76    94    112 \nTEVT Sector Total    81    89    123    147 \nAnnual Growth Rate       10%    38%    19% \nFY = fiscal year, TEVT = technical education and vocational training. \nNote:   To analyze the provincial government\u2019s financial commitment in the beginning of each financial year, the \n figures are from the original budget. \nSource: Finance Department, Provincial Government of Balochistan \n \n \n20.  Financial affordability and sustainability of the Project was analyzed. Due to limited \navailability of official long-term provincial budget forecasts and plans, and the major changes in \nbudget allocation arrangements in recent years, the financial analysis is based on the historical \nbudget trend of the TEVT sector and priority set for TEVT under the 10-year perspective plan \nand  education  sector  reform  for  2001\u20132005.  The  Project  is  expected  to  incur  recurrent \nexpenditure at approximately PRs36 million after the 6-year project implementation period, \nwhich consists of PRs18 million from DOE-administered polytechnics and organizations, and \nPRs18 million from DOLM-administered TEVT facilities and activities. To finance the additional \ncost, the TEVT budget under DOE needs to be increased annually by 5% (40% increase in 6 \nyears) and the TEVT budget under DOLM by 2% (about 15% increase in 6 years) during the 6-\nyear project implementation period. Comparing the past budget trends, which were constantly \nabove 10%, the annual increase at 5% in the TEVT budget under DOE and 2% for the TVTE \nbudget  under  DOLM  is  most  likely  to  be  achievable.  Also,  PGB  agrees  to  make  a  legal \ncommitment to allocate budget for the increased recurrent expenditure. \n ", "Appendix 15  57\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \nSector identified as a national     Yes Country  identified  as  a  national  priority  in  Yes \ncountry poverty partnership agreement \npriority  in  country  poverty    No    No \nanalysis  \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nGiven the strong linkage between poverty and low level of human development as measured by the human \ndevelopment index (HDI), the Government of Pakistan has set a major objective to accelerate gross domestic \nproduct growth, reduce unemployment, and reduce poverty in its Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan. In its \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of December 2003, the Government recognizes education as a key \ningredient for sustainable economic growth. Education is seen as a key to better quality of life, as well as a means to \nprovide employable skills to prepare the population for employment and for future development of the country. In \nparticular, the Government recognizes of basic education and skills development as key elements of poverty \nreduction. The plan and PRSP clearly identify priority areas for the education sector: (i) improving the literacy rate, (ii) \naccomplishing Education For All, (iii) improving the participation rate at the secondary level, (iv) producing higher \neducation graduates responsive to the socioeconomic and technical needs of the country, and (v) improving the \nquality of education. \n \nTechnical education and vocational training (TEVT) figures prominently in the development plan and PRSP as a \nstrategy to produce skilled human resources that contribute to the country\u2019s competitiveness. In the National \nEducation Policy, the Government sets specific targets to expand TEVT facilities and improve opportunities for \nenrollment in quality TEVT programs. In addition to establishing more polytechnic and monotechnic institutes across \nthe country, especially in Balochistan where TEVT facilities and opportunities are still limited, the Government plans \nto introduce job-oriented education and training at selected secondary schools throughout the country. To expand \nthe base of the country\u2019s skilled workforce, the Government has introduced a technical stream in 1,100 high schools \nwith the aim of increasing the number of matriculation pass students who choose to study technical, commercial, and \nvocational subjects from 35% at present to 50% by 2011. In addition, existing facilities at high schools, technical and \nvocational training centers, commercial colleges, and polytechnic institutes are being used to conduct evening \nprograms for out-of-school youth and dropouts to provide them with employable skills. These initiatives and activities \ndirectly support the Government\u2019s policy and national priority to reduce poverty by providing quality technical \neducation and vocational training, and expanding opportunities for accessing TEVT. \n \nThe Project\u2019s goal is to help reduce poverty in Balochistan by providing high-quality, relevant skills development \nprograms and increasing access and equity to TEVT. One of the major objectives of the Project is to enhance access \nand equity to TEVT with a greater focus on women and rural poor. The Project will promote employment in small and \nmedium enterprises by facilitating graduates\u2019 access to microcredit. \n \nThe proposed establishment of two new polytechnic institutes in Gwadar (boys) and Kzudar (girls), two potential \ngrowth centers, will greatly enhance access to TEVT. Together with the two existing polytechnic institutes, the \npolytechnics will produce about 1,000 technicians per year when in full operation. Many more rural poor students will \nbenefit from the programs and facilities, as evening shifts will be introduced as well as nonformal livelihood training \nprograms to cater mainly to women. About 500 polytechnic graduates will be able to access microcredit to start their \nown businesses. Considering that these TEVT graduates will be able to provide financial support to their families and \ngenerate employment for other people in the communities, the economic impact and benefits will be substantial.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                          Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nIn the past decade the incidence of poverty in Pakistan has increased sharply due to slow economic growth, decline \nin development spending, and lower agricultural outputs because of a severe drought. The proportion of the \npopulation living below the poverty line (defined by an intake of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day for the \nequivalent of PRs670 per capita per month in 1999 value) has increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to \n32.1% in FY2001, and deteriorated further to 38.2% in FY2003. Poverty in rural areas is normally higher than in \nurban areas; more than 75% of the poor live in rural areas. Although poverty increased in all four provinces of \nPakistan during this period, the provincial rates varied. In FY1999 urban Sindh had the lowest level of poverty (16%), \nwhile rural NWFP had the highest incidence (42%). In comparison to NWFP, Balochistan has a lower poverty \nincidence (22.5). Characteristics of the poor in Pakistan include illiteracy, large family size, nonworking heads of \nhouseholds, and lack of physical assets such as land or livestock. Studies show that poverty incidence of highest \namong household heads with occupations such as day laborer in agriculture, construction, trade, and transport \nsectors. It is also high among the self-employed, including urban street vendors and rural sharecroppers. \n ", " 58  Appendix 15 \n \nIn addition to the slowdown in economic growth and negligible increase in per capita income, poverty increase was \nalso attributed to (i) limited job growth and absorptive capacity of the formal sector; (ii) limited opportunities for \nunskilled youth to obtain on-the-job training and skills; and (iii) low quality of social services, particularly education \nand health services. \n \nAt the individual and family level, education is the most important factor distinguishing the poor from the non-poor\u2014\nthe proportion of literate household heads in poor households was almost half that in non-poor households. \nAccording to Social Development in Pakistan towards Poverty Reduction, access to employment in urban Pakistan \nreduces the incidence of poverty by 45%, while education and physical assets contribute another 12% and 9% \nreduction respectively. Investing in education and training that prepares students, including those who have missed \nopportunities in formal education, for employment will have a direct impact on reducing poverty, especially among \ndisadvantaged groups who lack educational opportunities due to lack of facilities in or near their villages and districts. \n \nEducational opportunities are limited especially in rural areas. The Mahbub-ul-Haq Center for Human Development \nhas developed a broad poverty index for Pakistan that takes into account deprivation in education and health, in \naddition to income. Among the three areas, poverty of education opportunities consistently ranked the highest from \n77% in 1970 to 58% in 1995. Pakistan has approximately 41 million adult illiterates and more are being added every \nyear. Less than 50% of girls in the 10\u201314-year age group in the rural areas are in school, and over 30% of all \nchildren are unlikely to attend school in the present situation.  \n \nThe Project will expand educational opportunities in TEVT in rural areas for livelihood programs for out-of-school \nyouths and adults who want to acquire skills for employment and to start their own business. Nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will plan and implement the livelihood programs. Innovative features such as identification of \ntraining needs and trades for self-employment will meet local needs as well as those of the outside market. Linkages \nwith the microcredit project supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will allow TEVT graduates to access \nmicrocredit facilities to start small businesses and help generate income and employment in the communities. All \nthese measures will help reduce poverty in the provinces especially in rural areas where educational opportunities \nare still very limited. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?      Yes     No   \nIs there a participation strategy?      Yes     No \nThe Project was formulated based on extensive consultations with all stakeholders including the federal Government, \nthe provincial government of Balochistan, and key  government agencies responsible for TEVT planning and \nmanagement. In Balochistan, consultations were held with key officials of the departments of education, labor and \nmanpower, fisheries, and mines and minerals; Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education; and other related \nagencies. Consultations were also held with NGOs and some representatives from TEVT institutions.  \n \nInvolving NGOs to conduct situation analysis on vocational training needs and trades for self-employment through \nrelevant  stakeholder  analysis  will  facilitate  participatory  processes  for  designing  and  implementing  the \nTEVT/livelihood programs. The involvement of the various stakeholders in particular NGOs, potential trainees, and \nthe private sector will enable TEVT institutions to implement the activities in a participatory manner. \nD.   Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender discrimination is a key factor associated with poverty. Incidence of poverty among women is higher \ncompared with men, and is characterized by low endowment of land and productive assets, unemployment, \ndiscrimination in the labor market, and limited access to economic options and political process. Pakistani women \nare generally discriminated against in almost all spheres of life, but the impact of discrimination in the education \nsector is most profound. The female literacy rate is only 29% compared with 55% for men. Gender inequality in \neducational opportunities is worse in Balochistan than in the other provinces and the national average. TEVT \nfacilities and opportunities for women are equally limited. O f the 77 polytechnic institutes in the country only 10 are \nfor women. The situation is somewhat better at the technical and vocational training level below polytechnics, with \nthe number of vocational training centers for girls almost equal to that for boys. However, the number of trades or \ntechnologies offered by the centers for girls is limited and enrollment is also lower in the training centers for girls. \nApart from cultural factors, socioeconomic factors play a role. In some rural training centers for girls, lack of public \ntransportation services presents a big obstacle, even preventing girls from enrolling. \n \nIn Balochistan the first Government Polytechnic Institute for Women (GPIW) was established under the ADB-funded \nTechnical Education Project in 2002. Enrollments for the first 2 years closely approximate the project targets. As the \npolytechnic becomes better known and graduates prove successful, more students are likely to enroll. Based on the \n ", "Appendix 15  59\ninitial response, GPIW at Quetta expects demand for places at the polytechnic to significantly increase in the next \nfew years. Enrollments at GPIW are expected to reach 500 when the third year courses are offered and most \nprograms are fully operational in 2004. However, opportunities for skilled and semiskilled vocational training for girls \nare still limited. Of the 11 technical training centers and vocational training centers, only one is for girls. The province \nrealizes the urgent need to address the issue and wants to provide greater opportunities to women in the training \ncenters under the Project. \n \nGender Plan \n \nEstablishment  of  a  new  polytechnic  and  other  measures  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  expand \nopportunities for girls/women to take up TEVT, especially in rural areas. Where feasible, the Project will also support \nmainstreaming gender needs. The following is a summary of interventions: \n(i)  Two new polytechnics, one for girls in Khuzdar and another for boys in Gwadar, will be established in \nBalochistan. The Project will support the establishment of three new training centers for women. New \ntechnologies to be introduced are computer and information technology, telecommunication technology, and \nbiotechnology. With these added to the existing programs, girls will have greater exposure to emerging \ntechnologies and better employment prospects.  \n(ii)  New initiatives will be introduced to enable girls as well as boys undergoing TEVT programs to gain \nexperience through on-the-job training in industries and introduction of microcredit and entrepreneurship \ntraining to prepare them for self-employment. A career guidance and job placement center will help girls \nprepare for jobs, and provide assistance for job search and job placement upon graduation. \n(iii)  Nonformal livelihood skills improvement programs for rural people will include girls and women. At least half \nof the targeted 20,000 trainees of the livelihood program will be girls/women. The NGOs will identify \nappropriate training needs for new skills and upgrading traditional skills. \n(iv)  To enable poor students from rural/remote areas to attend TEVT institutions, especially female students, \ntraining will be conducted in the communities to maximize participation  by women. Where training is not \npossible in the community, provision for accommodation in the form of student hostels or other arrangements \nwill be made. \n(v)  The project management unit and the partner NGOs will involve the female representatives of the union and \ndistrict councils in situation analysis, planning, and implementation of TEVT and livelihood programs in the \nrespective union and district councils. The project management unit will include women managers.  \n(vi)  A national consultant for gender and development will work with the project implementation unit and the \npartner NGOs to develop a detailed gender action plan to operationalize the Gender Plan. \n(vii)  A project performance monitoring and evaluation system will be developed and institutionalized to assess \nthe benefits and impact of the Project in terms of employment generation, incomes of graduates, and other \nrelated indicators by gender and socioeconomic group. \nHas an output been prepared?
