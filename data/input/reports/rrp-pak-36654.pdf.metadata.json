Summary  Initial  Environmental  Examination  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nThe  Restructuring  of  the  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining  System  Project  (Project)  will  help  the  Department  of \nEducation  and  the  Department  of  Labor  and  Manpower  in \nBalochistan  Province \ntechnical \ntraining  (TEVT)  system  covering \neducation  and  vocational \npostsecondary technician education at the polytechnic level, mid-\nlevel technical and vocational training for students after grade 8, \nand  livelihood  training  for  out-of-school  youth  and  women.  It \ncomprises  three  components:  (i)  institutional  development,  (ii) \nimprovement  of  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT,  and  (iii)  access \nand  equity  enhancement.  The  Project  will  focus  on  (i)  improving \nthe  capacity  of  TEVT  institutions  to  be  more  competitive  and \nresponsive  to  labor  market  needs  by  emphasizing  public-private \npartnerships, on-the-job training, and counseling services for job \nplacements; and (ii) introducing performance-based management \nand  management  development  programs  for  more  efficient \ndelivery  of  TEVT  programs.  The  relevancy  and  quality  of  TEVT \nprograms  will  be  improved  through  competency-based  training, \nteacher  training,  provision  of  learning  resources,  and  quality \ncontrol.  The  Project  will  support  rural  poor  and  women  through \nnew  programs  and  facilities,  livelihood  training  for  rural  areas, \nand  entrepreneurship \nto \nmicrocredit for self-employment. \n \nBalochistan  needs  to  increase  investment  in  education  and \ntraining. The total literacy rate for both sexes of 36.0% (53.0% for \nmales and 15.0% for females) is the lowest among all provinces \nin  the  country,  with  a  wide  disparity  between  genders  and \nbetween rural (30.0%) and urban (70.0%) areas. Poverty may be \nas  high  as  41.3%  compared  with  the  national  rate  of  32.1%.  To \nreduce  poverty,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  is  working  to \ndevelop  skilled  workers  and  generate  employment  especially  in \nindigenous  natural \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  using \nresources.  While  the  province  has  a  high  unemployment  rate, \nexisting job opportunities often are unfilled due to lack of trained \npersonnel. International employment opportunities are increasing \nfor  skilled  workers,  especially  in  middle  eastern  countries  and \nMalaysia.  To  prepare  workers  for  both  these  environments \nimprovements of the internal and external efficiency of the TEVT \nsystem  are  urgently  needed.  Efforts \nto  consolidate  and \nstrengthen  TEVT  programs  and  additional  investments  to  make \n\ntraining  and  support \n\nfor  access \n\n\f \nObjectives  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\nthe  TEVT  system  more  responsive  and  competitive  will  help \nimprove  the  prospects  of  TEVT  trainees  when  they  seek \nemployment or self-employment.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall \npoverty  reduction  strategy  by  enhancing  competitiveness  of \nTEVT  and  employability  of  its  graduates  in  line  with  emerging \nmarket  needs.  Focusing  on  Balochistan,  the  Project\u2019s  specific \nobjectives  are  to  (i)  restructure  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity,  efficiency,  and  autonomy  of  TEVT  institutions;  (ii) \nimprove  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs;  and  (iii) \nenhance access and equity to better quality TEVT, particularly for \nrural poor and women. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Department  of  Education  and \nDepartment of Labor and Manpower in provincial government of \nBalochistan  (PGB)  to  restructure  their  organizational  setup,  and \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  to  provide  better  quality  TEVT \nprograms  that  are  relevant  and  responsive  to  the  needs  of \nindustries.  The  Project  will  support  TEVT  institutions  to  improve \ntheir  planning  and  management  through  greater  autonomy  to \nprovide  higher  quality  and  more  relevant  TEVT  programs. \nProviding  training  for  teachers  and,  more  relevant  learning \nresources, introducing competency-based training, and improving \nquality  control  will  increase  the  quality  of  TEVT  programs. \nSupport to new facilities and new TEVT programs, and provision \nof livelihood training programs will provide better access to TEVT \nprograms for the rural poor and women. \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $22.9  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$5.4 million (23%) is the foreign exchange cost and $17.5 million \nequivalent (77%) is the local currency cost. \n \n\n \nSource \nGovernment \nStakeholders \nADB \n\n($ million equivalent)\n\nForeign \nExchange \n0.0 \n0.0 \n5.4 \n5.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n6.6 \n0.3 \n10.6 \n17.5 \n\n \nTotal \n   6.6 \n0.3 \n16.0 \n22.9 \n\n \nPercent\n29 \n1 \n 70 \n100 \n\nTotal \n\n \n   ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $16  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided.

The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nwill  be  applied  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting \nfirms.  \n \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  include  about  10,000 \nstudents  in  four  polytechnics  (two  existing  and  two  new)  and \nabout  10,000  students  in  14  training  centers  (11  existing  and  3 \nnew  for  women);  more  than  150  teachers  and  principals  in \npolytechnics,  and  about  600  teachers  and  principals  in  training \ncenters;  about  250  institute  management  committee  (IMC)  and \ncenter management committee (CMC) members; and more than \n20,000  out  of  school  youth  and  adults  in  livelihood  training \nprograms.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  enrollment  will  be \ntraining  centers,  and \ngenerated  by \nlivelihood \nsupporting  qualitative \nimprovements in the curriculum, teaching and learning methods, \nand resources, the Project will benefit many students enrolled in \nTEVT  system  across  the  province.  Of  the  total  beneficiaries, \napproximately  25%  will  be  women,  75%  will  come  from  rural \nareas, and 40% will be from economically poor families. \n\ntraining  programs.

Nongovernment \norganizations  will  plan  and  implement  the  livelihood  programs. \nInnovative  features  such  as  identification  of  training  needs  and \ntrades for self-employment will help meet local needs as well as \nthose  of  the  outside  market.  Credit  facilitation  support  will  allow \nTEVT  graduates  to  access  microcredit  facilities  to  start  small \nbusinesses  and  help  generate  income  and  employment  in  the \ncommunities.  All  these measures  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  the \nprovince especially in rural areas where educational opportunities \nare still very limited. \n \nThe  Project  faces  four  possible  risks:  financial,  institutional, \npolicy,  and economic.  Firstly,  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  expand \nTEVT  without  adequate  focus  on  consolidating  and  ensuring \neffective  services  at  the  existing  training  institutes  could  erode \nthe  financial  and  technical  base  needed  to  sustain  the  effective \noperation of these institutions. The Project supports measures to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  and  autonomy  of  TEVT  institutions  and \nseeks  PGB\u2019s  assurances  for  adequate  recurrent  budgets  and \nautonomy  of  TEVT  institutions  to  enable  them  to  manage  their \nfinancial resources based on the needs. \n \nlack  autonomy  and  effective \nSecondly,  TEVT \nleadership  to  make  them  responsive  to  labor  market  needs. \nWhile most TEVT institutions have IMCs or CMCs depending on \nthe type of institution, only a few of these committees are active \nlargely because of their poor governance structure, weak role of \nprincipals,  and  lack  of  time  among  IMC/CMC  members.  The \nProject  includes  a  management  development  program  and \nperformance-based  management  system \nthe \ncapacity of principals, teachers, and staff of TEVT institutions. \n \nThirdly,  while  the  federal  policy  on  TEVT  envisages  substantial \nimprovement in the quality, management, and financing of TEVT \nprograms,  translating  this  into  action  is  not  possible  without \nlinking  the  performance  of  TEVT  institutions  with  improvement \nplans,  targets,  and  policy  stipulations.  The  Project  aims  to \nincrease efficiency and effectiveness of TEVT institutions through \ninnovative measures such as quality assurance and accreditation \nsystems,  a  performance-based  management  system,  and \nexamination reform; and will seek PGB\u2019s assurances to align key \nTEVT policies at the provincial level. \n \nFourthly, the economy is not growing fast enough to absorb more \ngraduates  from  TEVT  institutions.  Related  to  this  is  the  limited \ninvolvement of the private sector in TEVT institutions. The Project \nsupports much greater involvement of the private sector through \nIMCs,  CMCs,  production  units,  guidance  counseling,  and  more \norganized labor market information. \n\nto  strengthen \n\ninstitutions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Restructuring  of  the  Technical  Education  and \nVocational Training System Project (Balochistan). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nPakistan\u2019s strong economic growth in the 1980s\u2014averaging 6.5%\u2014slowed considerably \nin 1990s to an average of 4.6%. Key social indicators, particularly for education, also stagnated, \ncomparing unfavorably with other countries at similar levels of development. However beginning \nin fiscal year (FY) 2003, the economy began to recover. The growth rate increased to 5.1%, and \nin  FY2004  it  is  estimated  at  6.4%.  To  achieve  the  significant  poverty  reduction  targets  in  the \npoverty  reduction  strategy1  for  Pakistan,  the  annual  economic  growth  rate  must  be  sustained \nabove 6%, particularly because population growth remains high. \n \n3. \nThe provincial government of Balochistan (PGB) faces dual problems of low educational \nattainment and high incidence of poverty among its population. The total literacy rate of those \n10  years  of  age  and  above  is  36.0%  (53.0%  for  males  and  15.0%  for  females),  and  the  net \nprimary school enrollment rate (2001) is about 37%\u2014the lowest rates in all of Pakistan. Literacy \nrates between genders and urban (70%) and rural (30%) areas (the majority (77%) live in rural \nareas)  differ  dramatically.  School  participation  is  low  at  66%  gross  enrollment  in  primary \neducation for both sexes (81% for boys and 48% for girls). Only about 63% of students in grade \n1  reach  grade  10  after  repeating  several  grades,  indicating  that  many  children  leave  school \nwithout appropriate skills and knowledge. \n \nIn  2001,  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Statistics  reported  Balochistan\u2019s  poverty  level  to  be \n4. \n22.8%.  However,  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  Balochistan  notes  that  the  22.8%  poverty \nfigure was \u201clargely a statistical aberration,\u201d and if past trends had continued, poverty would have \nrisen to 41.3% in 1998/99 against a national average of 32.1%. High levels of poverty have led \nto large variations in educational attainment among different economic groups. For instance, the \nnet  enrollment  in  primary  education  was  only  24%  for  the  lowest  economic  quintile  compared \nwith 39% for the highest. Key factors for the rapid increase in poverty during the 1990s were (i) \nthe  slowdown  in  economic  growth;  (ii)  negligible  increase  in  per  capita  income;  (iii)  limited  job \ngrowth  and  absorption  capacity  in  the  formal  sector;  (iv)  high  labor  costs  in  the  formal  sector \nthat  lead  to  overexpansion  of  the  low  productivity  informal  sector,  thus  putting  downward \npressure on wages in the informal sector; (iii) limited opportunities for unskilled youth to obtain \non-the-job  training  and  skills;  and  (iv)  low  quality  of  social  services,  particularly  education  and \nhealth.  \n \n5. \nPakistan\u2019s labor force grows at a rate of over 2.0% per annum, while employment grows \nmuch  more  slowly.  The  official  rate  of  unemployment  is  between  5.4\u20135.9%  whereas  the \nunderemployment  rate  (those  working  less  than  35  hours  a  week)  is  estimated  at  about  12%. \nThe  situation  is  much  worse  in  Balochistan,  with  unemployment  over  10%  (over  21%  for \nfemales)  and  about  40%  labor  force  participation  rate  (about  17%  for  females).  Most  workers \nare  self-employed  or  unpaid  family  workers;  wage  earners  account  for  less  than  one  third. \nAmong  urban  unemployed  youths  between  the  ages  of  10  and  24,  the  majority  are  either \n\n                                                 \n1  Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2003.

The national Government is working to develop \nskilled workers and to generate employment especially in small and medium enterprises using \nindigenous  natural  resources.  The  international  demand  for  skilled  workers  is  increasing, \nespecially in middle-eastern countries and Malaysia. The Project will assist PGB in its efforts to \nreduce poverty by providing greater access to quality technical education and vocational training \n(TEVT) programs especially in rural areas and for women, and facilitate access to credit to help \nTEVT  graduates  seek  employment  or  engage  in  self-employment  in  small  and  medium \nenterprises. \n \n6. \nBalochistan\u2019s TEVT subsector comprises two polytechnics\u2014one for women established \nunder  the  Technical  Education  Project  (TEP)2\u2014with  over  1,000  students  (about  435  women) \nand about 130 teachers; and 11 technical and vocational training centers (TVTCs), with about \n1,300 students. Only 1 TVTC is for women. Opportunities in the local labor market are limited \nand  Balochistan  has  been  less  successful  than  the  other  provinces  in  accessing  the \ninternational  job  market.  Given  the  low  participation  rate  in  general  education,  low  completion \nrates  at  primary  and  secondary  levels,  and  limited  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  the \neconomy and educational provision, PGB will have to adopt a two-pronged strategy: (i) improve \ngeneral  school  education  as  a  priority,  focusing  on  girls  and  rural  children;  and  (ii)  provide \nselective support to training programs as many youths lack the necessary employment skills. As \ngeneral  education  improves  and  provides  more  core  life  skills,  support  for  TEVT  will  shift  to \nmore practical aspects of training. However, for a few  years, until general education improves \nsignificantly, TEVT will have to focus on formal and nonformal TEVT programs as a complement \nto  general  education,  and  not  as  a  substitute.  This  approach  benefits  the  poor  who  need  a \nsecond chance for life skills. TEVT must be viewed from a holistic perspective to fill in gaps in \nthe context of overall educational needs. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  strategy  for  development  assistance  to  Pakistan3 \n7. \nfocuses  on  poverty \ninclusive  social \ndevelopment,  and  good  governance.  It  highlights  the  need  for  comprehensive  human \ndevelopment strategies, devolution of services for human development, and education reforms \nfor  quality.  In  particular,  it  supports  the  Education  Sector  Reforms  Action  Plan  of  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  (Government)  linked  with  the  devolution  process  to  promote  public-\nprivate  partnerships.  It  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  move  away  from  Government-based, \numbrella-based  projects  to  more  focused  province-specific  support.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  is  in  line \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  National  Education  Policy,  Education  Sector  Reforms  Action  Plan,  and \npoverty reduction strategy, and stresses the important role that TEVT plays in producing skilled \nworkers and technicians for the economy. The Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan 2001\u2013\n11 points out that options for technical, commercial, and vocational education in the country are \nstill  limited  and  sets  the  introduction  of  technical  education  at  secondary  and  postsecondary \nlevels as a priority. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nDespite  some  progress  in  the  province,  TEVT  still  faces  several  challenges  and \nconstraints,  which  need  to  be  addressed  systematically.  Appendix  1  provides  the  project \nframework, Appendix 2 the problem tree, and Appendix 3 a brief sector analysis. Some of the \nkey issues and opportunities are discussed in the following sections. \n \n                                                 \n2  Asian  Development  Bank.  1995.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fWeak  Institutional  Capacity.  The  two  polytechnics  are  under  the  Directorate  of \n9. \nColleges, Higher, and Technical Education, which is responsible for planning, coordination, and \nsupervision  of  both  higher  (i.e.,  general)  and  technical  education.  Examinations  of  students  of \ndiploma of associate engineer (DAE) programs, on the other hand, are organized by the Board \nof  Intermediate  and  Secondary  Education  (BISE),  which  is  responsible  for  conducting \nexaminations  for  students  from  elementary  to  technical  levels.  As  more  polytechnics  will  be \nestablished under the Government\u2019s Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan 2001\u201311 and the \nNational Education Policy 1998\u20132010, the planning, coordination, and supervision functions for \ntechnical education need to be integrated under one agency. PGB has approved in principle the \nestablishment  of  a  separate  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  (DTE)  in  anticipation  of \nexpanding  technical  education  in  the  province.  Given  the  important  role  of  this  directorate  in \nimproving  integration  and  coordination  of  TEVT  institutions  and  programs,  support  for  PGB  in \nestablishing this directorate is urgently required.  \n \n10. \nLow Internal and External Efficiency. The internal efficiency of polytechnic programs, \nwhile  still  a  concern,  has  improved  over  the  years.  The  dropout  rates  in  the  Government \nPolytechnic  Institute  for  Boys  (GPIB)  averaged  around  8%  between  1997  and  2002.  For  the \nGovernment Polytechnic Institute for Women (GPIW), the dropout rate was about 12% in 2002, \nthe first year of its operation. The high dropout rate results in wastage of resources and must be \nseriously  addressed.  The  average  percentage  of  students  who  pass  external  examinations  as \nper BISE records is quite low at 46% in 2002 compared with 65% in 1997.  \n \n11. \nExternal  efficiency  as  measured  by  the  number  of  graduates  who  obtain  employment \nafter graduation also needs to be improved. Based on the labor market survey conducted under \nan  advisory  technical  assistance,4  graduates  of  DAE  programs  spent  from  1\u20132  years  seeking \nemployment before they found a job. In addition, they required an additional 3\u20136 months training \nin the industry after recruitment. While limited employment opportunities in the private sector are \npartly  responsible  for  this  difficulty  finding  employment,  the  quality  and  relevance  of  technical \neducation is also to blame (para. 15). Entrepreneurship training could be introduced to prepare \nstudents  for  self-employment,  and  job  placement  services  provided  for  graduating  students. \nBoth polytechnics and TVTCs could also offer short-term modular training programs for people \nwho  want  to  acquire  skills  and  start  businesses  of  their  own.  Given  that  the  Government \nencourages semiskilled and skilled workers to find out-of-country employment especially in the \nMiddle East and Malaysia, TEVT must play an important role in preparing for this. \n \n12.  Weak  Linkage  with  Labor  Market  Needs.  Although  the  demand  for  some  traditional \ntrades  and  technologies  (electrical,  electronics,  and  mechanical)  and  new  trades  and \ntechnologies  (computer,  information,  and  telecommunication)  is  expected  to  remain  high,  the \nmismatch  between  skills  of  TEVT  graduates  and  labor  market  demand  means  that  TEVT \ngraduates  have  difficulty  getting  jobs  even  when  opportunities  exist.  A  labor  market  survey \nconfirms  that  (i)  not  enough  graduates  are  being  produced  in  some  of  the  traditional  courses \nand limited training opportunities are available in new technologies; and (ii) even if the courses \nare  available,  their  relevance  is  affected  by  lack  of  labor  market  information,  limited  and \ninappropriate practical training component, and lack of the necessary linkages with industries.  \n \n13. \nThe lack of sharing of information and resources between industry and TEVT institutions \ncreates a gap between users and producers of skilled workers, which in turn affects the quality \nof TEVT programs and graduates. As a result, students fail to acquire employable skills during \ntheir  training.  To  forge  a  closer  link  between  industries  and  TEVT  institutions,  institute \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  Pakistan  for  Restructuring  of  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Education \n\nSystem. Manila. \n\n \n\n  3\n\n \n\n\f 4\n\nmanagement  committees  (IMCs)  have  been  established  at  polytechnics  and  center \nmanagement  committees  (CMCs)  at  TVTCs.  However,  so  far  the  IMCs  and  CMCs  have  not \nproved  effective  in  drawing  needed  assistance  and  cooperation  from  industries.  To  increase \ntheir  effectiveness,  their  roles,  functions,  and  responsibilities  need  to  be  strengthened, \nleadership enhanced, and resource base improved. In addition, the committees, which include \nsignificant  industry  representation,  need  to  focus  on  providing  on-the-job  training  for  students, \nindustrial training for TEVT teachers, and job placement services for TEVT graduates. \n \nLimited Access to and Options for TEVT. With just two polytechnics and 11 technical \n14. \nand  vocational  training  centers  in  the  province  of  over  7  million  people,  Balochistan  lags  the \nother provinces in access to and options for TEVT. In Balochistan one TEVT institution is built \nfor about every 535,000 people, compared with one TEVT institution for 142,000 in Sindh, and \n311,000  in  Punjab.  This  indicates  the  need  to  expand  coverage  with  a  particular  focus  on \nwomen and vulnerable groups. The two polytechnic institutes are located in Quetta and the 11 \ntraining  centers  are  in  major  districts.  Although  the  polytechnics  provide  a  district  quota  for \nnomination  of  students to  their  training  programs,  the  number,  normally  5  seats  per  district,  is \nstill  low  compared  with  the  number  of  people  and  secondary  school  graduates  who  opt  for \ntechnical education. To address the issue of limited access and options, both the Government \nand PGB plan to establish additional polytechnics, especially in economic growth centers. This \nexpansion  plan  is  elaborated  in  the  National  Education  Policy  1998\u20132010  and  the  Education \nSector Reforms Action Plan 2001\u20132005.  \n \n15. \nPoor  Quality  of  Examinations.  TEVT  students  in  DAE  programs  must  take  external \nexaminations  conducted  by  BISE.  The  examinations  consist  of  written  tests  (60%),  practical \ntests  (20%),  and  internal  tests  given  by  the  lecturers  (20%).  The  problem  is  that  TEVT \ninstitutions  \u201cteach  for  the  exam\u201d  rather  than  for  transferring  practical  skills.  Because  of  lack  of \nfacilities and proper mechanisms, practical tests for certain subjects are given orally instead of \nrequiring  students  to  actually  perform  the  required  tasks.  For  the  written  tests,  a  total  of  167 \ntheory  papers  were  prepared  for  the  10  technologies  offered  at  the  two  polytechnics  in  2002. \nThe  quality  of  the  content,  coverage,  types  of  questions,  practical  tests,  supervision  and \nadministration of the examinations, marking of papers, and announcements of results all need \nto be improved. In addition, the structure of the examinations for each technology needs to be \nmodified to be in line with the DAE curriculum, which specifies 60% for practical exercises and \n40% for the theory of the subject matters. \n \n16. \nRole  of  the  Public  Sector.  The  TEVT  system  is  highly  supply  driven  and  needs  to \ndevelop  mechanisms  to  respond  to  market  needs.  Different  government  agencies  are \nresponsible  for  the  provision  of  TEVT  programs  resulting  in  lack  of  coherence  in  and \nfragmentation  of  TEVT  programs.  However,  with  the  strong  support  for  devolution  and  PGB\u2019s \nplan to consolidate TEVT coordination under one agency, an opportunity now exists to enhance \nthe  organization  of  TEVT  programs  as  well  as  limit  the  role  of  PGB  to  policy,  planning,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  as  envisaged  in  Government  policies  for  TEVT.  Implementation \nresponsibilities devolved to TEVT institutions will be supported by district advisory committees \n(DACs). \n \n17. \nLessons  Learned.  Appendix  4  provides  a  list  of  lessons  learned  and  how  they  have \nbeen  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Experience  from  the  TEP  and  an  ADB  impact  study  \nindicates  the  need  to  consolidate  and  strengthen  existing  TEVT  institutions,  while  proceeding \ncautiously  with  expansion.5  This  includes  providing  adequate  resources  for  operation  and \n                                                 \n5  ADB.  1999.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f  5\n\nmaintenance,  filling  all  vacant  teaching  positions,  and  ensuring  critical  inputs  for  effective \nteaching and learning. The high turnover of project directors, lack of information on labor market \nneeds,  and  absence  of  research  and  development  activities  have  adversely  affected \nimplementation  activities  and  constrained  TEVT  institutions  in  responding  to  emerging  market \nneeds.  \n \n18. \nThe  evolving  experience  with  institutional  consolidation  (from  406  institutions  in  7 \ndepartments  to  1  umbrella  department)  in  Punjab  and  its  efforts  to  move  away  from  the \ngovernment  being  a  provider  of  TEVT  to  standard  setting,  facilitation,  regulation,  and \ncoordination; Sindh\u2019s experience in devolution to the district level; and efforts by the North West \nFrontier  Province  to  consolidate  institutions,  provide  important  insight  and  implications  for \ninstitutional  development  and  strengthening  of  TEVT  institutions  in  Balochistan,  within  the \ncontext  of  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  plan.  Balochistan  has  already  agreed  in  principle  to \nconsolidate \nto  be \ninstitutionalized  carefully  with  appropriate  planning  and  preparation.  Critically  needed  are \ninstitutionalized strategic planning, policy reform, quality assurance, curriculum development for \nTEVT,  and  support  for  gradual  autonomy  and  strong  leadership  at  polytechnics  and  training \ncenters to enable them to improve their overall effectiveness.   \n \n19. \nExternal  Assistance.  The  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  has  supported \ntechnical and vocational training in the province; however external support for TEVT is generally \nvery limited. External assistance to the education sector in Pakistan is discussed in Appendix 5. \n \n\ninstitutional  arrangements  under  one  organization,  but \n\nthis  needs \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategic  goal  of \npoverty  reduction  by  enhancing  competitiveness  of  the  TEVT  system  and  employability  of  its \ngraduates  in  line  with emerging  market  needs.  Focusing on  Balochistan,  the  Project\u2019s  specific \nobjectives are to (i) restructure and strengthen institutional capacity, efficiency, and autonomy of \nTEVT  institutions,  (ii)  improve  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs,  and  (iii)  enhance \naccess and equity to better quality TEVT particularly for the rural poor and women. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nquality and relevance of TEVT, and (iii) access and equity enhancement. \n \n\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  institutional  development,  (ii)  improvement  of \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Institutional Development \n\n \n22. \nThis  component  will  help  restructure  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  agencies \nresponsible for policy development, planning, and management of the TEVT system in line with \nthe Government\u2019s key policies on reforming TEVT. The policy implications are presented under \nassurances (para. 73) and Appendix 6. This component covers three subcomponents.  \n                 \n\nStrengthening Organization and Management Capacity  \nof TEVT Facilities \n\na. \n \n \n\n23. \nThis  subcomponent  will  strengthen  organization  and  management  capacity  of  the  DTE \nunder  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  and  the  Directorate  of  Manpower  Training  (DMT) \n\n \n\n \n\n\funder  the  Department  of  Labor  and  Manpower  (DOLM).  The  Project  will  help  (i)  establish  the \nDTE and strengthen its capacity in research and development (R&D), and (ii) institutionalize a \nquality  assurance  and  accreditation  system  under  the  DTE  and  DMT.  The  DTE  will  be \nresponsible for development of policies, plans, and guidelines for institutional development and \nmanagement,  quality  assurance,  R&D,  curriculum  development,  and  staff  development \nprograms  for  technical  education.  The  new  DTE  will  be  provided  with  a  modest  building,  core \nstaff,  office  equipment,  and  furniture.  The  R&D  cell  to  be  transferred  to  the  DTE  will  receive \ntraining for staff; funds and equipment for selective research studies and surveys; and support \nfor developing a full-fledged computerized management information system (MIS), labor market \ninformation  system  (LMIS),  and  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \n(PPMES).  The  R&D  cell  will  undertake  some  research  and  studies  and  engage  appropriate \nresearch  and  academic  institutions  through  a  competitive  process  to  carry  out  more  complex \nresearch and studies such as labor market surveys and tracer studies. \n \n24. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  institutionalization of  a  quality  assurance  and  accreditation \nsystem under BISE for DAE programs, and trade testing board (TTB) under DMT for technical \nand  vocational  training  programs.  The  Project  will  help  BISE  and  TTB  develop  accreditation \nstandards; a quality assurance system; and mechanisms including criteria, guidelines, manuals, \nand instruments for assessing and improving the quality of TEVT programs. Both BISE and TTB \nwill receive equipment, training of personnel, and seed money to implement the system in their \nrespective  organization  for  both  public  and  private  TEVT  institutions.  The  Project  will  also \nprovide  training  for  staff  of  polytechnics  and  TVTCs  to  establish  an  internal  quality  assurance \nunit at all TEVT institutions.  \n \n\nb. \n \n\nImplementing a Performance-Based Management System \nfor TEVT Facilities \n\n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  a  performance-based  management \nsystem in all TEVT institutions to promote accountability and efficiency in TEVT management. \nTEVT institutions will be required to prepare a 5-year institutional development plan, which will \nserve  as  the  basis  for  budgetary  allocations.  Indicators  such  as  enrollment,  number  of  poor \nstudents  in  the  programs,  dropout  rate,  passing  rate,  and  employment  of  graduates  will  be \ndeveloped  and  used  to  assess  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  institutions.  The  Project  will \nprovide  funds  to  develop  guidelines,  criteria,  and  operation  manuals  for  implementation  of  the \nsystem.  Block  funds  from  the  Project  will  be  allocated  to  provide  incentives  to  selected  high \nperforming  project  facilities  to  undertake  additional  development.  Gradually,  TEVT  institutions \nwill  develop  the  capacity  to  be  more  autonomous  in  managing  their  own  operations.  PGB  will \nissue a notification to institutionalize the performance-based management system, which will be \ntied  to  budgetary  allocations  after  project  completion.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \ndevelop and implement the system. \n \n\nc. \n\nStrengthening Capacity of TEVT Facilities \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  help  strengthen  TEVT  capacity  to  plan,  manage,  and  assess  their \noperation and performance; (ii) establish DACs, and strengthen the capacity and resources of \nIMCs and CMCs; and (iii) implement management development programs (MDPs) for key TEVT \nofficials including principals and key staff members. \n \nStrengthening  Capacity  of  TEVT  Institutions.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  TEVT \n27. \npolicy  and  devolution  plan,  the  Project  will  help  TEVT  institutions  develop  capacity  to  plan, \nmanage,  and  evaluate  their  own  operations  and  performance.  Principals  and  staff  will  be \n\n 6\n\n \n\n\f  7\n\nprovided  training  in  key  competencies  to  enable  them  to  develop  a  5-year  institutional \ndevelopment  plan  that  clearly  identifies  objectives,  targets,  staffing  requirements,  capacity-\nbuilding  needs,  and  resource  allocation  and  requirements  to  help  them  achieve  the  objectives \nfor medium- and long-term development of their institutions. Staff development programs in the \nareas  of  market  analysis,  financial  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  organization \nmanagement, and social marketing will be implemented under the Project. By 12 months after \nproject  implementation  begins,  TEVT  institutions  will  also  prepare  a  resource  mobilization and \nutilization  plan  to  ensure  sustainability  of  new  investments.  An  institution  will  be  selected  to \ncarry  out  the  capacity-building  programs  at  TEVT  institutions.  Eventually,  the  institutional \ndevelopment  plan  will  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  disbursements  of  project  resources  to  the \ninstitutions to implement programs and activities that will contribute to the achievements of the \nobjectives specified in the plan. To consolidate TEVT programs, DTE and DMT will prepare (12 \nmonths  after  project  implementation  begins)  a  TEVT  rationalization  plan,  teacher  career \ndevelopment plan, and a plan for gradual autonomy of TEVT institutions to strengthen the TEVT \nsystem.  \n \nEstablishing  DACs  and  Strengthening  the  Capacity  and  Resources  of  IMCs  and \n28. \nCMCs.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  DACs  in  districts  with  polytechnics  and \nTVTCs.  The  DAC,  comprising  representatives  of  industries,  educational  institutions,  and  the \ncommunities, will help promote closer collaboration between local industries, the communities, \nand  the  institutions  in  order  to  mobilize  resources  and  support  from  the  private  sector  to  the \nTEVT  institutions.  In  addition,  it  will  support  the  IMCs  and  CMCs  to  provide  support  in  linking \nTEVT  institutions  with  industries  on  a  district-wide  basis.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  the \nIMCs  and  CMCs  in  all  TEVT  institutions.  Modest  financial  resources  will  be  provided  on  a \ncompetitive  basis,  based  on  proposals  submitted  by  the  IMCs  and  CMCs,  as  seed  money  to \nenable  them  to  carry  out  their  functions  more  effectively.  Capacity-building  programs  will  be \nconducted for members of the committees. In addition, procedure manuals will be developed for \nreference of the committees and TEVT institutions.  \n \n29. \nImplementing  MDP  at  TEVT  Facilities.  Qualified  local  management  institutions \nincluding  universities  and  higher  education  institutions  will  be  invited  to  submit  proposals  to \nimplement the MDP for staff of TEVT institutions under a management contract. The MDP will \nhelp improve the capability of principals, teachers, and staff to assume more responsibilities and \nautonomy in planning, management, and effective resource mobilization and utilization in their \ninstitutions.  The  MDP  will  cover  such  key  areas  as  market  and  competitiveness  analysis  for \ndemand-based  training,  financial  planning  and  management,  performance  improvement, \ninstitutional  development,  proposal  preparation  and  project  implementation,  and  evaluation  of \ntraining  programs.  The  MDP  will  support  TEVT  institutions  based  on  the  institutional \ndevelopment plans to enhance the competitiveness of polytechnics and TVTCs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Improvement of Quality and Relevance of TEVT \n\n \n30. \nThis  component  will  help  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs  in  four \npolytechnics (two existing and two new) and 14 TVTCs (11 existing and 3 new). The component \ncovers  three  key  areas:  (i)  developing  a  competency-based  training  (CBT)  system  and \nreforming  examinations,  (ii)  improving  quality  by  upgrading  facilities  and  developing  learning \nresources, and (iii) improving relevance of TEVT through innovative schemes.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 8\n\n \n \n\na. \n \n\nto  nominate  courses \n\ninstitution  will  be  required \n\nCBT  System  Development.  The  Project  will  help  develop  a \n\nProviding Competency-Based Training System Development \nand Examination Reform  \n\n \n \n \n31. \nframework  and \nmechanisms  for  introducing  the  CBT6  system  in  TEVT  institutions,  and  provide  training  to \nteachers to prepare lessons, instructional materials, and learning modules for their subjects in \nthe  CBT  format  with  a  focus  on  helping  students  to  practice  and  acquire  the  skills  that  meet \nindustry  standards.  Each  project \nin \ntechnologies/trades  to  be  converted  into  the  CBT  format  for  funding  under  the  Project.  At  a \nminimum,  each  technology/trade  will  convert  at  least  one  course  into  the  CBT  format.  The \nProject  will  support  this  initiative  by  providing  funds  to  teachers  who  submit  proposals  to \ndevelop lessons, instructional materials, and learning modules and packages in the CBT format \nfor their courses. A qualified institution will be selected to train the teachers and coordinate the \ndevelopment,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  CBT  system.  Funds  will  be  provided  to \nconduct  social  marketing  programs  to  raise  an  awareness  of  principals,  teachers,  students, \ncommunities, and potential employers about the characteristics and benefits of the CBT system. \nThe  CBT  system  is  expected  to  be  introduced  gradually  in  all  TEVT  programs  through  active \nparticipation of the teachers and institutions with incentives initiated under the Project. \n \n32. \nExamination Reform. Currently one of the responsibilities of BISE, established in 1977 \nas an autonomous corporate body, is conducting examinations at the DAE level for students of \npolytechnics.  The  current  examination  practices  are  inflexible  and  not  conducive  to  promoting \nstudent acquisition of practical skills required by industries. PGB will issue a notice to allow the \nProject to reform the examination system by preparing a framework and an operation manual to \nintroduce a new system in which TEVT institutions will be given autonomy and responsibilities to \nconduct  skills  tests  based  on  the  CBT  format.  Teachers  will  be  trained  on  how  to  prepare \nreliable and valid skills tests and practical examinations. The Project will also provide support to \nBISE  and  the  TTB  to  help  strengthen  capacity  and  improve  the  quality  of  the  theoretical \nexaminations.  This  will  include  training  examiners  and  paper  setters,  computerizing  the \nexamination  system,  developing  an  examination  items  bank,  strengthening  the  examination \nmanagement system, and providing office equipment and materials.  \n \n \n \n \n33. \nUpgrading  DAE  Programs  at  Polytechnics.  The  Project  will  upgrade  equipment  and \ntraining materials of four of the seven existing technologies at GPIB (civil, electrical, electronics, \nand  chemical)  that  are  identified  as  providing  good  employment  prospects  for  students. \nOutdated and nonoperational equipment will be replaced, and instructional materials in the CBT \nformat developed to help improve the quality of the training programs. The Project will support \nGPIW  to  introduce  one  new  technology  for  architecture  focusing  on  computer-aided  design; \nstrengthen  existing \nteacher \naccommodation  for  female  teachers  recruited  from  other  provinces.  The  Project  will  provide \nadditional  workshops,  laboratories,  equipment,  teachers,  and  funds  for  acquisition  and \ndevelopment  of  instructional  materials  in  the  CBT  format  for  the  implementation  of  the  new \ntechnologies. \n \n34. \nSupport  Implementation  of  Bachelor  of  Technology  (Electronics)  at  GPIB.  The \nQuetta  GPIB  has  recently  been  awarded  the  status  of  Government  College  of  Technology  to \n                                                 \n6  CBT training system is a TEVT training scheme that emphasizes trainees\u2019 abilities to perform tasks at a specified \nproficiency  level  according  to  industry  standards,  and  provides  a  wide  range  of  opportunities  for  learners  and \ntrainees to practice and acquire skills and knowledge and develop positive attitudes to become competent workers. \n\nImproving Quality by Upgrading Facilities and Developing \nLearning Resources  \n\ntechnologies  selectively;  and  support \n\nthe  provision  of \n\nb. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f  9\n\noffer  a  baccalaureate  program  in  technology.  It  has  been  sanctioned  to  offer  a  baccalaureate \nprogram in electronics and obtained initial funding for construction of a building block from the \nMinistry of Science and Technology. To enable GPIB to continue with activities to implement the \nbachelor of technology (electronics) program initially on a limited scale, the Project will provide \nfunds to establish laboratories and procure the necessary equipment, furniture, and instructional \nmaterials  for  the  program.  Project  funds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  conditions  that  (i)  PGB  will \nprovide additional funding to complete the construction of the building; and (ii) GPIB will prepare \na  detailed  development  plan  for  approval  by  PGB  concerning  the  implementation  of  the \nbachelor  of  technology  program  including  affiliation  with  a  university,  staffing  requirements, \nrecurrent expenditures, enrollments, and measures to ensure that the students will successfully \ncomplete their studies and find employment after graduation. \n  \nUpgrading  of Technical Training and Vocational Training Centers. The Project will \n35. \nsupport TVTC Quetta, the largest of the 11 existing TVTCs in terms of student enrollment and \nnumber of trades offered (13 trades), to become a model TVTC for the province. Its workshop \nfacilities  are  also  used  by  the  Staff  Training  Institute,  housed  in  the  same  premises,  for \nupgrading skills of teachers from TVTCs in the province. To access project funds, TVTC Quetta \nwill prepare a 5-year institutional development plan to become a model center with the objective \nof  becoming  more  self-reliant  and  autonomous  in  its  academic,  technical,  and  financial \nmanagement during the project period.  \n \n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  provide  the  necessary  workshops,  classrooms,  equipment,  and \ninstructional  materials  to  the  vocational  training  center  in  Gwadar,  which  is  designated  as  an \nindustrial hub and emerging sea port, to support new training programs on fisheries, computer \ntechnology,  telecommunications,  and  welding.  The  fishing  industry  in  Gwadar  is  among  the \nlargest  industries  in  Balochistan.  The  Project  will  involve  the  Department  of  Fisheries  and \nCoastal Development to (i) develop training programs, curriculum, and instructional materials for \nthe training courses; (ii) provide initial teaching staff from its cadre of officers; (iii) train teachers \nat  Gwadar  vocational  training  center;  (iv)  supervise  the  standard  and  quality  of  the  training \nprograms; and (v) conduct social marketing programs to increase awareness and acceptance of \nthe program among potential clients.  \n \nDevelopment of Learning Resource Centers at Polytechnics and TVTCs. In support \n37. \nof  the  CBT  system  and  to  allow  teachers  and  students  to  pursue  self-learning,  a  learning \nresource center and library  will be  established at all polytechnics and TVTCs. The Project will \nprovide computers, software, multimedia packages, books, and journals, which will be housed \npreferably in the library of each TEVT institution.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThis subcomponent will introduce innovative schemes to enhance employability of TEVT \n38. \ngraduates.  The  Project  will  help  introduce  an  entrepreneurship  training  program  in  TEVT \ncurriculum  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs). \nNew curriculum, textbooks, manuals, and instructional materials following the CBT format will be \ndeveloped and implemented in all TEVT institutions. The entrepreneurship training modules will \nbe made mandatory for all TEVT students. Teachers will receive training to conduct the program \nusing  the  materials  prepared  under  the  Project.  In  addition  to  entrepreneurship  training,  the \nProject  will  involve  the  consulting  services  along  with  experienced  private  sector/NGOs  to \ndevelop  mechanisms  and  facilitate  access  to  credit  to  help  TEVT  graduates  start  their  own \nbusinesses  and  thus  provide  self-employment  opportunities  for  TEVT  graduates.  Appropriate \nguidelines and procedures to access credit will be developed. \n\nImproving Relevance of TEVT through Innovative Schemes  \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n39. \nThe  Project  will  support  an  on-the-job  training  scheme  as  an  integral  part  of  the  TEVT \ncurriculum  to  enable  students  to  acquire  relevant  skills,  knowledge,  work  discipline,  and \nindustrial and work experience in industries through structured learning exercises. The scheme \nwill help foster closer cooperation between TEVT institutions and the private sector. The IMCs \nand  CMCs  will  be  strengthened  to  establish  linkages  and  operational  mechanisms  with  local \nindustries  to  support  this  scheme.  The  IMCs  and  CMCs  will  actively  pursue  the  possibility  of \nintroducing  evening  shifts  in  partnership  with  NGOs/private  sector  to  provide  teachers  with \nadditional  income,  to  enhance  the  utilization  of  equipment  and  building,  and  to  infuse  new \norganizational skills in public TEVT institutions. The Project will develop necessary operational \nguidelines, mechanisms, and procedures to ensure effective implementation of the scheme.  \n \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  career  guidance  and  job  placement  center  at  all  TEVT \n40. \ninstitutions  by  providing  furniture,  equipment,  and  career  guidance  materials.  A  qualified  staff \nmember will be trained and assigned as a career guidance and job placement officer either on a \nfull-  or  part-time  basis.  With  the  support  of  the  CMC/IMC,  the  center  will  liaise  regularly  with \nindustries to obtain information about job openings and provide career guidance and counseling \nservices  to  TEVT  students  to  find  employment  in  industries.  The  center  will  maintain  and \nregularly update a database on local industries, job openings, job placements, and employment \nrecords of TEVT graduates. \n \n41. \nThe Project will establish a production and service center in partnership with the private \nsector  in  selected  TEVT  institutions.  The  center  will  accept  work  orders  for  production  and \nprovide  services  to  both  internal  and  external  clients.  The  management  of  the  unit  will  be \ncontracted out to qualified private institutions or NGOs that are willing to engage teachers from \nthe TEVT institutions and train the students on a profit-sharing basis. The students will be given \nallowances for their work at the center. TEVT institutions will be allowed to retain a share of the \nincome  for  their  own  use.  The  Project  will  provide  facilities,  equipment,  furniture,  and  seed \nmoney  to  establish  the  center  and  support  its  initial  operations.  The  center  is  expected  to \nbecome self-sufficient and will be managed independently as a business unit. \n \n\n \nComponent 3: Access and Equity Enhancement \n\n \n3. \n\n \n\na. \n\nIntroducing Equivalency and Certification System \n\n \n42. \nThis component covers three areas to provide greater access to TEVT among the rural \npoor and women, especially those who lack opportunities to obtain skills training in formal TEVT \nprograms.  \n \n \n \n43. \nThe Project will help BISE and TTB to establish an equivalency and certification system \nwith appropriate mechanisms for skills assessments based on the CBT standards. The system \nwill  give  qualifying  credits  and  issue  trade  certificates  to  students,  trainees,  and  workers  who \npass the external examinations and assessments. The equivalency system will provide learning \nopportunities for those who have acquired other forms of prior learning as well as opportunities \nfor skilled workers to obtain formal qualifications for career development and for employment in \nother  countries.  BISE  and  DMT  will  be  responsible  for  developing,  implementing,  and \ninstitutionalizing  the  equivalency  and  certification  system  for  their  respective  agency.  Skills \nassessment  centers  will  be  established  at  selected  polytechnics  and  TVTCs.  They  will  be \nprovided with necessary infrastructure, equipment, and materials to help launch the equivalency \nand  certification  system;  and  social  marketing  activities  to  increase  awareness  and  promote \n\n 10\n\n \n\n\f  11\n\n \n\nb. \n\nImplementing Nonformal Livelihood Skills Improvement Programs \n\nbetter  understanding  and  acceptance  of  the  equivalency  and  certification  system  among \nstudents and the public.  \n \n \n \n44. \nNonformal  training  programs  to  improve  livelihood  and  provide  employable  skills  to \nabout  20,000  out-of-school  youths  and  adults  (at  least  50%  women)  will  be  provided  largely \nthrough  qualified  NGOs  identified  competitively.  Interested  polytechnics  and  TVTCs  can  also \ncompete for the funds and may choose to partner with NGOs. Subjects and topics will be based \non the needs of the communities and employment opportunities in the areas. Course duration \nwill  be  flexible,  but  normally  shorter  than  the  standard  training  programs.  Course  fees  will  be \nminimal  to  ensure  some  cost  recovery  and  enable  the  poor  to  acquire  skills  needed  for \nemployment  and  livelihood  improvement.  To  be  eligible  for  the  funds,  TEVT  institutions  and \nNGOs  will  conduct  situation  analysis  with  relevant  stakeholders  and  potential  trainees  for \nplanning  of  livelihood  training  programs  on  farms  and  nonfarm  activities  for  the  poor.  After \nsituation analysis, the TEVT institutions and NGOs will submit a proposal to conduct nonformal \nlivelihood training programs to the project management units for approval and funding. Locally \nbased livelihood training programs will be introduced to reach remote communities and the rural \npoor. The amount of financial support will be based on the duration of the course, the number of \ntrainees, and other related criteria. TEVT institutions offering nonformal training programs will be \nallowed to retain and utilize the money from the Project and the fees to supplement their regular \nbudgets. The nonformal livelihood training programs could eventually be made a regular feature \nof TEVT institutions as outreach/community services and to promote employment opportunities \nand livelihood employment among the poor in the province. \n \n \n \n \nIn  line  with  the  National  Education  Policy  and  in  support  of  PGB\u2019s  plan  to  provide \n45. \nequitable access to TEVT and to promote industrial development in the province, the Project will \nestablish  two  polytechnics\u2014one  in  Gwadar  (men)  and  the  other  in  Khuzdar  (women).  Each \npolytechnic  will  be  provided  with  classroom  and  laboratory  blocks,  student  hostel,  teacher \naccommodation  for  the  women\u2019s  polytechnic  in  Khuzdar,  training  equipment,  instructional \nmaterials,  and  other  learning  resources.  The  polytechnic  at  Gwadar  will  initially  offer  four \ntechnologies:  three  will  be  information  technology,  telecommunication,  and  food  preservation. \nThe fourth will be determined by a market survey to be conducted during the first year of project \nimplementation.  The  polytechnic  in  Khuzdar  will  initially  offer  four  technologies:  three  will  be  \ndressmaking  and  fashion  design,  information  technology,  and  secretarial  practices  and  office \nmanagement. The fourth one will be determined by a market survey to be conducted during the \nfirst year of project implementation. \n \n46. \nThe  Project  will  establish  three  TVTCs  for  women  in  Hub,  Loralai,  and  Turbat,  all  with \npotential for high economic growth. These institutions provide better opportunities especially to \nwomen  and  the  rural  population  to  obtain  employable  skills,  which  will  further  enhance  their \nlivelihood.  Hub  will  provide  up  to  six  technologies  (radio  and  television,  refrigeration  and  air-\nconditioning,  industrial  electronic,  dress  designing  and  dressmaking,  computer  hardware  and \nsoftware,  and  household  appliances  repair).  Loralali  will  offer  up  to  five  technologies  (food \npreservation,  dress  designing  and  dressmaking,  computers,  leather  crafts,  and  household \nappliances).  Turbat  will  provide  up  to  five  technologies  (food  preservation,  embroidery,  dress \ndesigning  and  dressmaking,  electronics,  and  household  appliances  repair).  The  Project  will \nprovide  teachers  and  instructional  materials,  and  support  new  construction,  equipment,  and \n\nEstablishing Two New Polytechnics and Three Technical Training \nCenters \n\nc. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 12\n\nSpecial Features \n\nfurniture.  The  Project  will  support  the  preparation  of  a  gender  action  plan  to  improve  gender \nimbalance in the TEVT subsector.  \n \nC. \n \n47. \nThe  Project  supports  PGB  to  consolidate  TEVT  programs,  with  cautious  expansion \nlinked to greater emphasis on market needs and women and rural poor. The consolidation effort \nemphasizes  integrating  and  strengthening  TEVT  programs  in  existing  institutions,  focusing  on \nfilling  all  teacher  vacancies,  providing  in-service  training  to  teachers,  improving  quality  and \nrelevance  of  existing  programs,  and  allocating  adequate  budget  for  basic  operation  and \nmaintenance before embarking on any large-scale expansion.  \n \nThe Project emphasizes improving institutional efficiency through greater autonomy and \n48. \nensuring effective leadership of TEVT institutions, greater partnership with the private sector in \nrunning evening classes and production units, and supporting performance-based management \nto  make  TEVT  institutions  more  competitive,  relevant,  accountable,  and  responsive  to  labor \nmarket needs.  \n \n49. \nThe  Project  emphasizes  equity  and  access  by  supporting  TEVT  programs  for  females \nand  the  poor  in  rural  areas.  The  Project  is  also  exploring  the  possibility  of  introducing  double \nshifts  in  selected  TEVT  institutions  to  run  programs  for  both  female  and  male  students.  The \nProject supports construction of selected hostel facilities for women who come from rural areas. \nThe  Project  supports  more  relevant  livelihood  programs  (for  example,  fisheries,  livestock, \nagriculture, food preservation, and crafts) and access to microcredit for rural females and rural \npoor,  and  also  supports  the  engagement  of  NGOs  to  provide  services  to  out-of-school  youth, \nwomen, and rural poor. \n \nD. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $22.9 million equivalent, of which an estimated $5.4 \n50. \nmillion,  or  23%,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost.

Each  coordinator  will  seek  inputs  as  necessary  from  consultants  and \nexperts from concerned PGB offices to implement district activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  April  2005,  and  will  be \n\n \n55. \ncompleted by the end of October 2010. A tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n56. \nADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  civil  works  contract  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent  of  more  than  $1,000,000  and  each  supply  contract  for  equipment  or  materials \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational competitive bidding. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to \ncost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. \nCivil  works  contracts  equivalent  to  $1,000,000  or  less  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local \ncompetitive bidding. Equipment and textbooks estimated to cost, in aggregate, the equivalent of \nless than $100,000 may be directly procured. The indicative contract packages are in Appendix \n10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n57. \nA  total  of  77  person-months  of  consulting  services  (18  person-months  of  international \nand  59  person-months  of  domestic)  will  be  utilized  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. A higher education institution and or a management institute will be selected and \nengaged for the MDP, performance-based management, and development of the CBT system. \nThe  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  individually  (for  project  management  and  for \nspecific technical expertise) or as a firm. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be \napplied  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting  firms.  Appendix  11  provides  indicative \nterms of reference and consulting requirements. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nimmediately  after \n\nThe  Planning  and  Development  Department  will, \n\n \n58. \nloan \neffectiveness, establish two imprest accounts, one for each of the PMUs. The accounts will be \nin  a  Government-approved  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to  expedite  disbursement  of  the  loan \nproceeds, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nbetween the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited into each of the imprest \naccounts will not exceed $300,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be followed \nto liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000. \nDuring  midterm  review,  PGB  and  ADB  may  decide  to  reallocate  funds  to  DOE  or  DOLM, \ndepending  on  the  progress  made  in  order  to  support  effective  implementation  and  potential \nreform. \n \n59. \nTo  expedite  preparatory  activities,  DOE  and  DOLM  must  undertake  advance  action,  in \nparticular  the  selection  and  engagement  of  a  higher  education  institution  and/or  management \n\nthe \n\n 14\n\n \n\n\f  15\n\ninstitute, selection and engagement of consultants, and the preparation of request for proposals. \nRetroactive  financing  of  up  to  $200,000  has  been  approved  in  principle  for  expenditures  for \npreparatory  activities  incurred  between  project  appraisal  and  loan  effectiveness.  All  advance \naction will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB has advised \nPGB that the approval of advance action and retroactive financing (in principle) does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n60. \nEach  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report and submit them to ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter. \nWithin  3  months  of  physical  completion,  each  PMU  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to \nADB.  Each  PMU  will  (i)  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  all  expenditures  financed \nout of the loan proceeds; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to \nADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s report. The audit report will include an audit \nwith separate opinion on the use of imprest accounts and statement of expenditure procedure. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System \n\n \n61. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  strengthening  the  MIS,  LMIS,  and  PPMES,  as  well  as \nundertaking research on important areas such as tracer studies of graduates and labor market \nsurveys. During the first year, the Project will help the DTE and DMT establish a comprehensive \nPPMES  by  developing  baseline  information  on  all  TEVT  institutions,  and  developing  MIS  and \nLMIS linked to a set of key monitoring indicators indicated in the project framework. The PPMES \nwill help monitor progress made on key indicators over the project period, and also support all \nTEVT  institutions  to  monitor  their  performance  against  the  indicators  presented  in  their \ninstitutional  development  plan.  The  performance  indicators  will  cover  internal  and  external \nefficiency,  as  well  as  quality  and  institutional  indicators  such  as  number  of  teacher  positions \nfilled,  quality  of  teachers,  availability  of  instructional  materials,  and  institutional  capacity.  The \nPPMES will allow comparison between the status at the time of project start-up, and outputs at \nmidterm  and  end  of  the  Project.  TEVT  annual  planning  and  budgeting  will  be  linked  to \ninformation  available  from  the  PPMES.  The  PPMES  will  establish  mechanisms  to  introduce \nmandatory  reporting  and  sharing  of  information  with  the  public.  To  ensure  effective  and \ntransparent  utilization  of  resources,  PGB  will  require  the  TEVT  institutions  to  provide  financial \ninformation to DACs each year. Appendix 12 provides a list of key indicators and strategy for the \nPPMES. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n62. \nPGB and ADB will jointly conduct two semiannual reviews (at least one full review) of the \nProject every year. PGB and ADB will jointly establish the issues to be addressed during each \nmission and reports required. During the third year of implementation, PGB and ADB will carry \nout a midterm review of implementation arrangements, with a focus on a few key issues. ADB \nand PGB will consider changes based on the findings of the midterm review. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  focuses  on  consolidating  and  strengthening  existing  TEVT  programs  in \n63. \nBalochistan  with  cautious  expansion  by  improving  the  capacity  of  TEVT  institutions  to  become \nmore  competitive;  providing  better  quality  and  more  relevant  skills  to  TEVT  students  in  selected \ntechnologies; and helping improve equitable access among women and rural poor. The Project is \ndesigned  to  make  TEVT  more  responsive  to  labor  market  needs  and  support  the  graduates  to \neither find suitable initial employment in the local or international markets without long waiting time \nor  to  seek  microcredit  to  start  their  own  businesses.  The  Project\u2019s  staff  development  activities \nbenefit teachers of the participating TEVT institutions by improving their practical and subject skills. \nAll  these  inputs  are  expected  to  improve  external  efficiency  of  the  TEVT  system  in  the  form  of \ngreater employment opportunities and higher earnings.  \n \n64. \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  over  6  years  will  be  about  10,000  students \nenrolled (about 2,500 graduates) in four polytechnics (two existing and two new), about 10,000 \nstudents (about the same number of graduates) in 14 training centers (11 existing and 3 new), \nand about 20,000 out-of-school youth and adults to receive nonformal livelihood training. Other \ndirect beneficiaries include over 150 teachers and principals in polytechnics and 600 in training \ncenters,  and  about  250  IMC  and  CMC  members.  Based  on  the  demographic  profile  of  the \nprovince  and  anticipated  expansion  of  TEVT,  about  75%  of  the  total  direct  beneficiaries  are \nanticipated  to  come  from  rural  areas,  about  25%  will  be  female,  and  about  40%  will  be  from \neconomically poor families. Poorer communities will benefit mostly from the livelihood programs, \nbut also from the DAE and trades programs since most of these students are unable to proceed \nto general education. \n \n65. \nThe DAE and trades programs will benefit small and medium enterprises in the province \nthrough the introduction of improved learning methods, resource materials, and modern up-to-\ndate  equipment.  The  focus  on  practical  application  and  linkages  with  the  industry  for  both  the \nstudents  and  teachers  will  allow  polytechnics  and  training  centers  to  learn  from  the  industry, \nwhile the industry will be able to get more skilled graduates to improve their productivity. TEVT \ngraduates  will  also  be  able  to  prepare  for  the  international  market,  which  has  provided \nemployment  opportunities  to  many  Pakistanis  and  contributes  to  the  overall  economy  through \nincreasing  remittances.  Livelihood  training  will  provide  opportunities  in  rural  areas  for  out-of-\nschool youths and adults to acquire skills for employment and to start their own ventures. With \nthe  support  of  NGOs,  the  provision  of  programs  that  are  in  demand  and  have  much  greater \nflexibility  should  be  possible.  Credit  facilitation  support  will  allow  TEVT  graduates  to  access \nmicrocredit  to  start  small  ventures  and  help  generate  income  and  employment  in  the \ncommunities. All these measures are expected to help reduce poverty in the province especially \nin rural areas where educational opportunities are still very limited. The Project also addresses \nthe needs of women by expanding opportunities and increasing access to quality TEVT through \nthe  strengthening  of  existing  polytechnic  institutes  and  training  centers,  and  supporting  the \nestablishment of two new training centers.  \n \nB. \n \n66. \nThe  Project  faces  four  possible  risks:  financial,  institutional,  policy,  and  economic. \nAppendix 14 identifies potential risks and proposed mitigation measures. First, PGB\u2019s effort to \nexpand  TEVT  without  adequate  focus  on  consolidating  and  ensuring  effective  services  at  the \nexisting  training  institutes  could  erode  the  financial  and  technical  base  needed  to  run  these \n\nProject Risks \n\n 16\n\n \n\n\f  17\n\ninstitutions  effectively.  The  Project  supports  measures  to  strengthen  the  capacity  and  greater \nautonomy  of  TEVT  institutions  and  seeks  PGB\u2019s  assurances  for  adequate  recurrent  budgets \nand necessary provision to enable TEVT institutions to manage their financial resources based \non the needs of the institutions. Economic and financial analyses are presented in Appendix 14. \n \n67. \nSecond,  TEVT  institutions  lack  autonomy  and  many  lack  effective  leadership  to  make \nthem  responsive  to  labor  market  needs.  While  most  TEVT  institutions  have  IMCs  or  CMCs \ndepending  on  the  type  of  institution,  only  a  few  of  these  committees  are  effective  largely \nbecause of weak governance structure and weak role of the principals. The Project includes an \nMDP  and  performance-based  management  system  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  principals, \nteachers,  and  staff  of  TEVT  institutions.  The  Project  also  supports  capacity-building  programs \nfor members of IMCs and CMCs together with modest financial assistance to make them more \neffective in providing support to TEVT institutions. \n \n68. \nThird, while the federal policy on TEVT envisages substantial improvement in the quality, \nmanagement,  and  financing  of  TEVT  programs,  this  will  not  be  possible  without  linking  the \nperformance  of  TEVT  institutions  with  improvement  in  plans,  targets,  and  policy  stipulations. \nThe  Project  aims  to  increase  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  TEVT  institutions  through \ninnovative measures such as a quality assurance and accreditation system; performance-based \nmanagement  system;  and  examination  reform  to  enable  the  institutions  to  focus  on \nimprovement  of  quality,  relevance,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  their  programs  and \noperations. The Project also seeks PGB assurances to align key TEVT policies at the provincial \nlevel. \n \nFourth,  the  economy  is  not  growing  fast  enough  to  absorb  more  TEVT  graduates. \n69. \nRelated to this is the limited involvement of the private sector in TEVT institutions. Unless the \nprivate sector, which is going to be the main provider of employment, is more actively engaged, \nTEVT graduates will continue to have difficulty finding jobs. The Project supports much greater \ninvolvement  of  the  private  sector  through  IMCs  and  CMCs,  production  units,  guidance \ncounseling, more organized labor market information, and credit facilitation for self-employment. \n \nC. \n \n70. \nsupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nD. \n \n71. \nThe  Project  aims  to  increase  equity  in  and  effectiveness  of  TEVT  programs  by \nsupporting  three  training  centers  and  one  polytechnic  for  women  who  will  mostly  come  from \nrural areas. The focus on improving quality and organization of all TEVT institutions will benefit \nstudents  largely  from  poorer  families  from  rural  areas.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 15. \n \n\nCategory B. An initial environment examination was undertaken and the summary is in \n\nSocial Analysis \n\nEnvironment \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA.  \n \n72. \nhave been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, PGB has given the following assurances, which \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 18\n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nTo  implement  new  initiatives  and  programs  to  improve  the  quality,  relevance,  and \n73. \nefficiency of the TEVT programs and institutions in accordance with the national policies on the \nTEVT  subsector,  PGB  commits  to  issue  within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness  the  following \nbinding directives:  \n\nTEVT institutions in Balochistan will (a) adopt the CBT system developed under \nthe Project for selective subjects and courses in all trades and technologies; (b) \nrequire  teachers  of  these  subjects/courses  to  conduct  practical  examinations \nfollowing  the  CBT  principles  and  format;  (c)  develop,  implement,  and/or \nstrengthen on-the-job training programs as an integral part of the curriculum for \nall  technologies  and  trades;  (d)  encourage  teachers  to  obtain  industrial \nexperience with pay as part of the ongoing in-service training programs; and (e) \ngradually  assume  more  autonomy  in  the  management  and  utilization  of \nresources including retention of revenues to support their activities according to \nthe PBMS to be introduced under the Project. \n\nBISE and DMT will develop, implement, institutionalize, and/or strengthen the (a) \nequivalency and certification system in Balochistan to provide more opportunities \nand  greater  access  to  TEVT  for  out-of-school  youths  and  adults,  and  (b) \naccreditation  and  quality  assurance  system  to  improve  the  quality  of  TEVT \ninstitutions in Balochistan. \n\n \n74. \nTo ensure continuity, efficiency, and smooth implementation of the Project, PGB agrees \nthat each project director will be recruited for at least a term of 3 years. In case of an absolute \nnecessity  to  replace  a  project  director,  inter  alia,  due  to  unsatisfactory  performance,  PGB  will \nrecruit  a  new  project  director,  on  a  competitive  basis,  with  qualifications,  experience,  and \nexpertise acceptable to ADB. \n \nTo  ensure  effective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  PGB  commits  that  upon \n75. \ncompletion of the TEP, essential experienced staff of the TEP project implementation unit will be \ntransferred to the PMU at DOE. \n \nPGB  will  sanction  recruitment  of  necessary  teaching  and  nonteaching  staff  for  (a)  any \n76. \nnew polytechnics and training centers before procurement of equipment for and construction of \nthese  polytechnics  and  training  centers;  and  (b)  any  new  programs  contemplated  under  the \nProject  before  commencement  of  these  programs.  PGB  will  start  recruitment  of  such  staff \nimmediately  after  the  (a)  establishment  of  new  polytechnics  and  training  centers,  and  (b) \ncommencement of new programs. \n \n77. \nloan effectiveness. \n \n78. \nPGB  agrees  that  the  existing  R&D  cell  will  become  part  of  the  PMU,  at  DOE.  PGB \nfurther agrees that within 9 months of loan effectiveness (a) the R&D cell will integrate with the \nDTE, and (b) PGB will become responsible for its expenses. \n \n79. \nUnless  agreed  otherwise,  PGB  will  ensure  that  within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness \neach TEVT institution will develop and submit for review and approval of the PMUs at DOE and \nDOLM a 5-year institutional development plan that clearly identifies objectives, targets, staffing \nrequirements,  capacity  building  needs,  and  budgetary  requirements  to  qualify  for  civil  works, \nequipment, and other support from the Project. \n\nPGB  commits  to  establish  a  DTE  with  necessary  staff  and  budget  within  9  months  of \n\n \n\n\f  19\n\nBy  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  PGB  and  ADB  will  evaluate  the  necessity  for  and \n\nPGB  will  allocate  and  make  available,  in  a  timely  manner,  requisite  counterpart  funds \n\n  \n80. \nfrom its budget for each fiscal year for the smooth implementation of the Project.  \n \n81. \nimplications of integrating TEVT institutions in Balochistan under one umbrella. \n \n82. \nPGB  will  ensure  that  within  11  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  newly  established \nDTE  will  enhance  competitiveness  of  the  polytechnics  and  the  existing  DMT  to  enhance  the \ncompetitiveness  of  technical  training  centers,  and  vocational  training  centers  will  prepare  for \nPGB\u2019s  approval  a  5-year  plan  encompassing  (i)  TEVT  rationalization,  (ii)  teacher  career \ndevelopment,  and  (iii)  gradual  autonomy  for  TEVT  institutions.  PGB  commits  that  the \nimplementation of such a plan will begin within 1 month after its approval.  \n \n83. \nPGB  commits  to  maintain  the  additional  recurrent  costs  of  approximately  $0.6  million \nequivalent required annually after project completion on 31 October 2010 to sustain the project \ninvestments.  \n \n84. \nPGB will ensure that a basic MIS and LMIS including all baseline information will be set \nup by the PMUs at DOE and DOLM within 12 months of loan effectiveness with plans for further \ndevelopment during the project period. \n \n85. \nPGB will ensure women's participation in project implementation in accordance with the \ngender strategy set out in Appendix 15, and that at least 50% of the livelihood training programs \nwill include women. A gender action plan to improve gender imbalances in the TEVT subsector \nwill be prepared jointly by the DOE PMU and DOLM PMU, and approved and implemented by \nthe DTE and DMT within 12 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \nPGB  confirms  that  all  required  land  for  the  Project  is  PGB\u2019s  land,  free  from  any \n86. \nencumbrances,  structures,  human  settlements  or  cultivation.  PGB  further  confirms  that  the \nProject  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  and  no  persons  will  be  adversely \naffected in terms of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople. \n \n87. \nPGB  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  safety  measures  are \nincluded  in  the  design  of  the  project  facilities  and  will  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are \nconstructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy.  PGB \nwill  ensure  implementation  of  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  as  set  out  in  the  initial \nenvironmental examination carried out for the Project. \n \nPGB will support and encourage public-private partnerships in the sharing and utilization \n88. \nof  resources  of  TEVT  institutions,  such  as  management  of  production  and  service  centers;

Elementary education can be further subdivided into primary \n(grades  1\u20135)  and  middle  levels  (grades  6\u20138).  Secondary  comprises  grades  6\u201310  and  higher \nsecondary  grades  11\u201312.  A  baccalaureate  in  general  science  or  humanities  takes  another  2 \nyears  after  the  higher  secondary  school  certificate  making  a  total  of  14  years,  whereas \nprograms on engineering and medicine take longer. \n \n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  at  the  federal  level  is  responsible  for  policy,  planning  and \noverall  educational  standards.  It  also  has  control  over  the  curriculum  for  grades  1\u201312.  The \nprovincial  department  of  education  is  responsible  for  education  in  each  province.  Recently, \nunder  the  devolution  plan,  responsibility  for  education  was  devolved  to  the  districts  where  the \nexecutive district officer for education is responsible for supervision and promotion of education.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nTechnical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  (TEVT)  in  Pakistan  can  be  divided  into \nthree subcomponents: prevocational or school level, technical education, and vocational training \n(TEVT), and higher engineering and technology education. The history of the introduction and \nintegration  of  prevocational  and  vocational  courses  into  the  general  school  education  dates \nback  to  the  early  1950s  and  many  experiments  have  been  conducted.  However,  these  efforts \nhaven\u2019t had a significant impact on general school education, which from the period of colonial \nrule  was  geared  toward  producing  clerks  and  other  office  workers  rather  than  technicians, \nengineers, and scientists. The education policy of 1972\u201380 suggested a major shift from general \neducation  and  emphasized  relating  education  to  the  world  of  work.  This  resulted  in  the \nintroduction of agro-technical studies (wood work, metal work, and electricity), agriculture, and \nhome economics in urban, rural, and girls\u2019 middle schools respectively in grades 6\u20138. In grades \n9\u201310 introduction of vocational courses of various groups such as agriculture, commerce, home \neconomics,  and  industrial  arts  was  encouraged.  More  recently,  this  approach  is  reaffirmed \nunder the National Education Policy and Education Sector Reform Program. \n \n4. \nThe rapid growth of the TEVT subsector is due to the Government\u2019s desire to increase \naccess  of  rural  youths  and  women  to  technical  education  and  vocational  training  to  improve \ntheir  job  skills  and  means  of  livelihood.  The  lack  of  places  in  the  universities  also  led  to \nexpansion of the subsector, as it became an alternative channel for youth and school leavers. \nThis  resulted  in  the  social  demand  for  more  opportunities  for  and  access  to  TEVT.  The \nGovernment assumed the main responsibility of providing TEVT to youths with little participation \nof  the  private  sector.  Only  during  the  last  few  years  has  there  been  a  growing  trend  toward \nencouraging  participation  of  the  private  sector  in  TEVT  provision.  Under  the  Education  Sector \nReforms Program, a number of incentive schemes have been introduced to enlist private sector \nparticipation in education and training. \n \n5. \nVocational  Training.  Vocational  training  caters  to  unemployed  youths  who  lack  skills \nand  those  who  either  drop  out  of  the  school  system  or  fail  to  qualify  for  admission  in  the \npolytechnic  institutes  and  colleges.  Expansion  in  vocational  training  took  place  during  1980\u2013\n1990,  and  included  establishing  several  training  centers  and  upgrading  a  number  of  old  ones \nacross the country. The Ministry of Youth Affairs also established 20 youth vocational centers. \nThe  expansion  of  vocational  training  and  the  establishment  of  national  and  provincial  training \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nboards  took  place  through  the  promulgation  of  the  National  Training  Ordinance  in  1980.  This \nalso  emphasized  qualitative  improvement  in  vocational  training,  initiation  of  training  programs \nfor  women  in  nontraditional  trades,  and  closer  involvement  of  employers  in  planning  and \nadministration of vocational training.   \n \n \n6. \nThe duration as well as entry qualifications for different vocational training programs vary \nwidely. Training programs range from a few weeks to 2 years and entry qualifications vary from \nmiddle  to  secondary  school  pass.  Vocational  courses  are  more  practically  oriented  compared \nwith  technical  education.  The  curriculum  of  vocational  courses  comprises  80%  practical  and \n20% theory. Graduates are expected to perform semiskilled and skilled jobs in various sectors \nor can be self- employed. \n \nThere  are  only  11  technical  and  vocational  training  centers  (TVTCs)  in  10  of  the  26 \n7. \ndistricts in Balochistan, the largest province in physical size, offering training in 19 trades. The \ntraining  centers  operate  under  the  aegis  of  the  Department  of  Labor  and  Manpower  (DOLM). \nThe duration of courses varies from 4 weeks to 12 months. Enrollments in the 11 public training \ncenters  during  the  2001\u20132002  session  in  both  regular  and  evening  programs  totaled  around \n1,300 trainees. In addition, 294 trainees enrolled in short courses offered at the TVTC in Quetta, \nthe women\u2019s TVTC in Quetta, and the TVTC in Khuzdar. Of the 11 training centers, only 1 is for \nfemales.  In  addition,  23  private  training  institutions  offer  mainly  computer  training  and  are \nregistered with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE). \n \n8. \nTechnical  Education.  Technical  education  refers  to  postsecondary  school  training  of \nmiddle  level  supervisory  technicians  carried  out  in  polytechnic  institutes.  These  technicians \nserve  as  a  link  between  engineers  and  technologists  and  the  skilled  and  semiskilled  workers \nbelow.  The  rapid  growth  of  the  TEVT  subsector  was  the  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to \nincrease  access  of  rural  youth  and  women  to  technical  education  and  vocational  training  to \nimprove their job skills and means of livelihood. The lack of places in the universities also led to \nexpansion of the subsector, as it became an alternative channel for youth and school leavers. \nThis resulted in the social demand for more opportunities for and access to TEVT.  \n \n9. \nA 3-year course leading to diploma of associate engineer (DAE) is the main program of \nthe polytechnic institutes in the country. The DAE curriculum comprises 60% practical and 40% \ntheory. The polytechnic institutes offer a wide range of training programs in traditional as well as \nnew and emerging technologies. While the number of technologies offered in various institutions \nin other three provinces ranges from one in the case of monotechnic institutes and up to eight in \nbigger  polytechnics,  there  are  only  two  polytechnics  in  Balochistan  (one  for  boys  and  one  for \ngirls)  with  over  1,000  students  enrolled.  The  polytechnic  institute  for  women  in  Quetta  was \nestablished only in 2002 under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Technical Education \nProject. For a province with over 7 million people, this is considered inadequate and compares \nvery unfavorably with other provinces. \n \n10. \nThe persistent demand of DAE holders for the extension of facilities to higher education \nin the field of technology resulted in the introduction in late 1970s of a baccalaureate degree in \ntechnology,  with  a  uniform  pattern  throughout  the  country.  The  baccalaureate  program  (pass \ncourse) takes 2 years, 1 year on-the-job experience and 1 year teaching for DAE holders; and \nthe  honors  baccalaureate  is  also  2  years,  again  one  year  on-the-job  training  and  1  year \nschooling,  for  those  who  passed  the  pass  course).  To  offer  the  baccalaureate  program,  a \nnumber  of  polytechnic  institutes  were  upgraded  to  the  level  of  college  of  technology.  In \nBalochistan,  the  polytechnic  institute  for  males  was  also  upgraded  to  offer  the  program.  This \ninitiative  is  considered  important  for  two  reasons:  (i)  to  provide  some  opportunities  to  DAE \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n 27\n\nGovernance, Structure, and Management of TEVT \n\ngraduates  to  get  further  training,  and  (ii)  to  upgrade  qualification  of  DAE  teachers  given  that \nabout 50% have only DAE qualification. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe TEVT system lacks operational integrity as a system. The components of TEVT \nwere  divided  and  dispersed  to  become  separate  and  uncoordinated  functions  of  many \norganizations.  Traditionally,  technical  education  was  placed  under  the  responsibility  of  the \nprovincial and district education departments, while vocational training was with the directorate \nof  human  resources  training  under  DOLM.  As  a  result,  policy  of  training  was  duplicated,  and  \nplanning and monitoring were poor. The merging of TEVT into a single system has become an \ninternational benchmark in addressing the paradigm shift in human resource development. Over \nthe past 10 years a major realignment of TEVT systems of Asia Pacific countries has occurred \nas  a  human  resource  management  strategy  of  globalization.  This  international  trend  and \nrealization  internally,  has  led  to  changes  in  Pakistan  as  well.  Much  progress  has  been  made \nrecently  in  Punjab  with  the  initiative  of  the  Punjab  government  to  establish  the  Technical \nEducation  and  Vocational  Training  Authority,  responsible  for  all  training  programs  under  a \ncorporate  structure.  The  North-West  Frontier  Province  is  moving  in  this  direction,  while \nBalochistan and Sindh are watching this development carefully. \n \nIn Balochistan, the TEVT system is not integrated into one body. Technical education is \n12. \nattached to the Directorate of Colleges, Higher, and Technical Education under the Department \nof  Education,  while  technical  and  vocational  training  is  provided  by  the  11  TVTCs  under  the \nDMT, which in turn is under DOLM. The organization of the TEVT system was not affected by \nthe devolution plan and TEVT institutions lack autonomy. Although the provincial government of \nBalochistan  (PGB)  intends  to  establish  a  directorate  of  technical  education  under  the \nDepartment  of  Education  to  manage  and  organize  technical  education,  a  plan  to  merge  all \nTEVT institutions under one institution similar to the North-West Frontier Province is also being \ndiscussed. \n \nD. \n \nTraditionally  most  TEVT  institutions,  particularly  the  polytechnic  institutes,  were \n13. \nestablished to train the workforce for Government departments and public sector organizations \nwhere  their  qualifications  (certificate/diplomas)  served  as  proof  of  competence.  Until  recently \nvery little attempt has been made to involve the end users in the operation, management, and \nprogram  delivery,  and  to  align  the  course  contents  to  the  needs  of  industries.  This  failure  has \ncontributed  to  the  marginalization  of  TEVT  institutions  with  employers  showing  little  interest  in \nextending  cooperation  to  the  institutions  due  to  lack  of  interactions  between  industries  and \nTEVT  institutions.  Consequently,  TEVT  programs  are  seen  as  out  of  step  with  the  needs  and \nexpectations of the workplace. \n \n14. \nA  labor  market  survey  conducted  in  2003  under  an  advisory  technical  assistance \nsupported  by  ADB  provided  important  implications  for  the  TEVT  system.  First,  the  graduates \nidentified a lack of industrial training skills and inadequate practical content as a key weakness \nof  the  TEVT  programs,  followed  by  shortage  of  equipment,  insufficient  consumables  and \nlearning materials, and poorly prepared teachers. Consistent with this observation, the majority \nof the enterprises rated practical skills, troubleshooting, report writing and communication skills, \nand  safety  consciousness  as  poor.  Graduates  who  got  employment  had  to  undergo  an \nadditional 3 months of training by their employers. \n \n\nDemand and Supply of Skilled Workers and Technicians \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nKey Issues and Challenges in TEVT \n\nSecond,  the  survey  indicated  that  the  annual  future  demand  for  skilled  workers  and \n15. \ntechnicians  as  high  in  electrical,  mechanical,  electronics,  computer  and  information,  and \ntelecommunications;  and  as  moderate  in  civil  and  construction,  auto  and  diesel,  refrigeration \nand air-conditioning, plastic, rubber, and petroleum trades and technologies. \n \n16. \nThird,  the  survey  indicated  that  there  is  mismatch  of  skills  between  those  imparted  in \nTEVT  institutions  and  those  required  by  the  industry,  which  may  be  associated  with  lack  of \ntimely updating of curriculum, lack of teachers with appropriate expertise, or shortage of funds. \nThis  may  also  be  due  to  an  inflexible  training  system,  which  is  difficult  to  change  to  meet  the \nneeds of the labor market. The mismatch also comes from gaps in the competencies imparted \nby the TEVT institutions and those demanded by the industry, such as lack of skills in practical \naspects, troubleshooting, report writing, and communication.   \n \nE. \n \n17. \nThe analysis of the TEVT system vis-\u00e0-vis the emerging needs of the economy indicates \nseveral  areas  for  improvement.  First,  consolidation  of  TEVT  programs  is  urgently  needed  to \nensure that existing programs are organized and managed effectively in response to emerging \nlabor market needs, both for the local and international markets. Second, given that Balochistan \nhas  very  limited  opportunities  for  TEVT  due  to  limited  involvement  of  the  private  sector,  PGB \nneeds  to  make  targeted  investments  to  expand  and  improve  TEVT  quality,  particularly  for \nwomen and rural poor. PGB needs to play a strategic role to ensure an effective and responsive \nTEVT  system  through  policy  reforms,  regulation,  targeted  investments,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation;  and  providing  a  greater  role  for  nongovernment  organizations  and  private  sector, \nwhich  is  in  line  with  the  national  education  policy,  education  sector  reform,  and  poverty \nreduction  strategy  paper.  Third,  PGB  regulatory  function  needs  to  ensure  application  of  core \nprinciples  such  as  linkages  with  industry,  practical  orientation  of  TEVT  programs,  provision  of \nlabor  market \nto  TEVT  students  and  graduates, \nperformance-based management to target funds, and greater flexibility to introduce changes in \nteaching  and  learning  in  response  to  emerging  labor  market  needs.  Finally,  providing  greater \noperational autonomy to TEVT institutions to plan and manage their programs effectively is very \nimportant.  This  approach  promotes  effective  leadership  and  performance-based  management \nand allows TEVT providers to become more responsive and competitive.  \n\ninformation  and  counseling  services \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nLESSONS LEARNED \n \n\nLessons Learned \n \nProject Design and Processing \n \n1.

The Government could not provide \nrecurrent budgets to cover operation, \nmanagement, and maintenance of the new \ninstitutions and facilities. \n \n \n6.  Data on demand and supply of labor \nmarkets in various industries were neither \navailable nor taken into consideration in \ndesigning TEVT curriculum.  \n \n7.  Provision of industrial experience in the \npolytechnic curriculum as well as in the pre-\nservice and in-service training of technical \nteachers should be included in the project \ndeign.  \n \n8.  Future Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassistance should focus on \nmicrolevel/institutional issues to address \nvarious project implementation deficiencies \nand provide autonomy to TEVT institutions.  \n \nProject Implementation \n \n9.  Project implementation was delayed due \nto weak coordination between the federal and \nprovincial governments and bureaucratic \npractices in Government mechanisms \n \n\nIncorporations of the Lessons in Project Design \n\n \n \n \n1.  The project design incorporates the views, needs, \nand feedback from government agencies, private \nsector representatives, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), teachers, students, and the communities \nthrough extensive consultations during project \nformulation. \n \n2.  The Project is provincially based and will be \nimplemented by the province to ensure full \ncommitment and to expedite project implementation \nactivities at the provincial level. \n \n3.  Cost estimates were prepared in collaboration with \nthe concerned provincial government and with \nassistance of financial analysts to ensure accuracy \nand completeness of the data. \n \n4.  Draft PC 1 was prepared, discussed, and revised \nwith inputs from the concerned government agencies \nduring project preparations and will be reviewed \ncarefully during appraisal. \n \n5.  The provincial government was requested to \nearmark adequate recurrent budgets to support \nproject activities and provide assurance to give \nhighest priorities to provide adequate recurrent \nbudgets to the project institutions and facilities. \n \n6.  Labor market survey was conducted during \ntechnical assistance implementation and findings \nregarding demand-supply of skilled workers and \ntechnicians   incorporated in the project design. \n \n7.  The project design includes on-the-job training as \nan integral part of TEVT curriculum. Technical \nteachers will receive in-service training in industry to \nupgrade their skills and knowledge \n \n \n8.  The project design incorporates components to \nenhance capacity and autonomy of TEVT institutions \nto become more independent in managing their \nprograms and operations. \n \n \n \n \n9.

Frequent turnover of  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) project director and \nmanger affected the delay and performance of \nproject implementation. \n \n \n11.  Inadequate training in project \nmanagement, procurement, project accounting, \nand auditing of staff of executing agencies and \nPIU contributed to inefficient project \nimplementation and delay. \n \n12.  Inadequate supervision of project \nimplementation activities by ADB\u2019s review \nmissions contributed to delays in project \nimplementation. \n \n \n \n13.  Delays in recruitment of teachers for new \ntechnologies/subjects due to restrictive \ngovernment rules and regulations, and lack of \nrecurrent budgets to hire contractual teachers \naffected the implementation and operation of \nnew programs. \n \nProject  Sustainability and Impact \n \n14.  Lack of cooperation and support from the \nprivate sector in the operation and \nmanagement of TEVT institutions result in poor \nquality of TEVT and mismatch of skills among \nTEVT graduates. \n \n \n15.  Planning, management, monitoring, and \nsupervision of TEVT system was not effectively \ncarried out due to lack of baseline data, \nbenchmarks, management information system, \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation system, and \ninternal project statistics.  \n \n \n16.  Lack of social marketing campaign resulted \nin poor response and participation by target \ngroups and beneficiaries.  \n \n \n \n\nIncorporations of the Lessons in Project Design \n\n \n10.  Professional project manager will be recruited \nfrom the market. Government agrees that the project \nmanager will not be replaced for at least 3 years. If the \nproject manager needs to be replaced, the \nGovernment will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence.  \n \n11.  To the extent possible experienced PIU staff from \nTechnical Education Project will be retained and \nappropriate training in project management, \nprocurement, accounting, and other topics provided. \n \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s supervision of project activities will be \nstrengthened in terms of mechanisms for improved \nmonitoring and provision of more time and staff, more \nfrequent field visits, and the involvement of Pakistan \nResident Mission in project supervision and loan \nadministration.   \n \n13.  The Government is committed to removing the \nrestrictive rules and regulations regarding the \nrecruitment of teachers from other provinces, and to \nprovide recurrent budgets for hiring technical teachers \nfor new programs on a contractual basis. \n \n \n \n \n14.  Participation and cooperation of the private \nsector in planning and operation of TEVT will be \nenhanced through the establishment of district \nadvisory committees and strengthening of institute \nmanagement committees and center management \ncommittees. \n \n15.  Baseline data will be established in the first year. \nManagement information system (MIS), labor market \ninformation system (LMIS), project performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system (PPMES) will be \nstrengthened and institutionalized under the \nstrengthened research and development (R&D) cell. \n \n \n16.

These  serve  as  a  framework  for  the \ndevelopment of the TEVT subsector in Pakistan. These policy provisions can be further grouped \ninto  seven  policy  areas;  namely,  (i)  improving  planning,  management,  coordination,  and \ninstitutional  development;  (ii)  encouraging  need-based  and  performance  based-  funding,  cost \nrecovery  for  self\u2013reliance,  and  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  TEVT;  (iii) \nstrengthening  evaluation,  examinations,  and  accreditation  of  TEVT  programs  and  institutions; \n(iv) improving the skills and qualification of teachers through in-service training and provision of \nliberal  in-service  training  facilities  for  teachers;  (v)  regular  revising  and  upgrading  curricula, \nintroducing emerging technologies including computer education as a compulsory component of \nthe  curriculum  of  technical  education,  introducing  a  modular  approach  to  provide  continuing \neducation in TEVT, and developing teaching-learning resource materials by TEVT teachers; (vi) \nincreasing  equity  and  access  to  TEVT  by  establishing  new  institutions,  providing  distance \neducation  and  continuing  education,  broadening  the  base  for  TEVT  by  introducing  a  new \ntechnical  stream  for  students  (technical)  and  extending  opportunities  for  further  education  for \nTEVT  graduates;  and  (vii)  improving  quality  of  TEVT  by  refurbishing  and  modernizing \nlaboratories, workshops, and training equipment. \n \nB. \n \nThese  policy  stipulations  have  direct  implications  for  the  development  of  the  TEVT \n2. \nsystem  within  the  scope  of  the  Project.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  adopt  the  strategy  of \n\u201cqualitative  improvement  and  modest  quantitative  expansion  in  strategic  areas\u201d  in  order  to \nachieve the seven key objectives for TEVT as outlined in the NEP. These objectives are (i) to \nexpand opportunities for TEVT in the province to produce trained human resources to meet the \nemerging needs of industry, (ii) to improve the quality of TEVT to enhance the employability of \nTEVT graduates, (iii) to design TEVT programs that serve the dual purpose of self-employment \nand providing trained human resources for industry, (iv) to provide relevant technical skills and \ndesirable  work  ethics  among  the  students  through  innovative  measures,  (v)  to  establish  an \nevaluation  system  that  emphasizes  practical  skills  and  project  orientation,  (vi)  to  promote \ninstitution-industry  linkages,  and  (vii)  to  impart  employable  skills  to  reduce  unemployment \namong educated youth through nonformal livelihood training programs. \n \n3. \nIn  addition  to  the  Government\u2019s  policy  stipulations,  other  policy  implications  from  the \nProject  have  been  incorporated  in  the  framework.  For  example,  resource  considerations  for \nachieving  these  policies  should  be  incorporated.  The  target  for  higher  budgetary  allocation  by \nmid-term  as  a  percentage  of  allocations  to  TEVT  will  be  (carefully  studied)  and  reflected  as \nappropriate. \n \n\nPolicy Reform Proposed under the Project \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policies on \nTEVT Subsector \n \n1.

The project scope covers two government agencies in Balochistan: \nDepartment  of  Education  (DOE)  for  technical  education  and  Department  of  Labor  and \nManpower  (DOLM)  for  technical  and  vocational  training.  As  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project, \nthe Planning and Development Department will develop a steering committee to coordinate and \nfacilitate DOE and DOLM project implementation activities.  \n \nSteering  Committee.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Planning  and  Development \n2. \nDepartment. A steering committee headed by the additional chief secretary of the Planning and \nDevelopment  Department  has  been  established,  comprising  secretaries  of  DOE,  DOLM,  and \ndepartments  of  fisheries  and  finance;  chief  economist  and  chief  of  foreign  aid  at  the  Planning \nand  Development  Department;  and  two  representatives  from  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and \nthe  districts  of  Gwadar  and  Khuzdar,  to  coordinate  policy  reform,  address  implementation \nbottlenecks, and provide overall guidance. The steering committee will meet at least quarterly to \nreview project implementation.  \n \n3. \nImplementing  Agencies.  DOE  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for \ntechnician  education  (polytechnics)  and  DOLM  the  Implementing  Agency  for  technical  and \nvocational training. DOE was the executing agency for the recently closed Technical Education \nProject,  and  the  Directorate  of  Manpower  Training  under  the  DOLM  received  13  years  of \nsupport from the German Technical Assistance Agency. As a result, both have mechanisms for \nfinancial management and reporting. \n \nProject Management Unit. A project management unit (PMU) will be established under \n4. \neach  implementing  agency.  Each  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  director  recruited  from  the \nmarket  on  a  competitive  basis.  Each  project  director  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of the Project in close collaboration with the recipient institutions. Other staff of \nthe  PMU  will  comprise  procurement  officer,  accounts/disbursement  officer,  monitoring  and \nevaluation officer, and support staff. To ensure continuity and smooth implementation of project \nactivities,  experienced  and  relevant  project  implementation  unit  staff  under  the  Technical \nEducation Project will be retained in the PMU as appropriate. \n \n5. \nTo  ensure  continuity  and  efficiency  in  project  implementation  each  project  director \nrecruited from the market will sign an agreement with the Government committing to stay with \nthe  Project  for  at  least  3  years.  If  the  project  director  must  be  replaced  due  to  unsatisfactory \nperformance, the Planning and Development Department will seek the concurrence of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to replace the individual through a competitive procedure.  \n \n6. \nFunding  Mechanisms  and  Conditions.  Funding  mechanisms  and  release  of  project \nresources  for  financing  of  certain  types  of  programs  and  activities  under  the  Project  are \ncontingent upon satisfactory completion of prior conditions and requirements.

TEVT institutions will not be able to \nrecruit teachers for the new programs \nbecause of restrictive government \nregulations and inadequate budget. \n \n \n3.  Administrators and staff of TEVT \ninstitutions need support to implement a \nperformance-based management system \nand other programs such as competency-\nbased training (CBT) system.  \n \n \n \n4.  The Government has been unwilling or \nnot ready to grant more autonomy to TEVT \ninstitutions to manage their own programs \nand operations. \n \n \n \n5.  Various government agencies involved \nin project implementation may not extend \nfull cooperation to each other in \nimplementing new programs at existing \nTEVT institutions. \n \n \n6.  Capacity of the provincial government \nis too weak to manage new institutions and \nprograms introduced under the project. \n \n \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n \n1.  Two approaches are being pursued. First, \nthe provincial government has committed to \nprovide additional recurrent budget. Second, \nTEVT institutions will be allowed to retain their \nrevenues to finance their activities. This \nincludes partnership with the private sector and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). Other \npossibilities will be explored to mobilize \nresources. \n \n2.  The Government has agreed to relax its \nregulations to allow TEVT institutions to recruit \nqualified teachers from other provinces. The \ninstitutions will also be allowed to use their \nresources to hire contractual teachers. \n \n3.  Capacity-building programs, such as \nmanagement development programs, will be \nprovided by a management institute or \nuniversity. The National Institute of Science and \nTechnical Education will be engaged to provide \ntechnical assistance to TEVT institutions for \nCBT and teacher training. \n \n4.  Under the devolution scheme the \nGovernment has agreed in principle to allow \nTEVT institutions more autonomy to manage \ntheir own operations.

New programs are more market driven. \nCloser industry-institution linkage will enable \nTEVT institutions to better prepare students for \nemployment. Career guidance and job \nplacement services will help graduates find \nappropriate employment. \n \n8.  The Government has agreed to retain a \nproject manager for at least 3 years. A project \nmanager who is recruited from an open market \nwill ensure continuity of project implementation. \n \n9.  Social marketing campaigns will be launched \nearly to raise awareness and understanding of \nthe schemes. Capacity-building programs will \nbe provided for TEVT institutions. Principals, \nteachers, and staff of TEVT institutions will play \nthe role of change agents for implementation of \nthe new schemes in their institutions. \n \n \n10.  The Project has made provisions to \nprovide incentives to NGOs and the private \nsector for their participation in the programs \nand activities. Consultations with NGOs and the \nprivate sector during project formulation confirm \ntheir interest in providing cooperation and \nsupport to project activities. A social marketing \ncampaign will be launched to involve NGOs \nand the private sector in these programs.

Pakistan has 562 public technical education and vocational training \n(TEVT)  institutions  that  are  unevenly  distributed  across  the  provinces.  About  85%  are \nconcentrated in Punjab and Sindh, and the remaining 15% are shared by North-West Frontier \nProvince  (NWFP)  and  Balochistan.  The  average  size  of  a  TEVT  institution  in  each  province \nvaries  substantially  from  one  province  to  another.  As  the  population-TEVT  institution  ratio  in \nTable  A14.1  indicates,  one  TEVT  institution  is  built  for  every  311,000  in  Punjab,  142,000  in \nSindh,  and  266,000  in  NWFP.  However,  in  Balochistan,  one  TEVT  institution  is  available  for \nevery  535,000  people.  When  private  TEVT  institutions  are  included,  Balochistan  lags  even \nfurther behind the other three provinces.  \n \n\nTable A14.1: Distribution of Population and TEVT Institutions in Pakistan \n\nItem \nPopulation (\u2018000) \nTEVT Institution  \nPolytechnics \nTVTCs \nOther \nPopulation-TEVT \nInstitution Ratio (A/B) \n\nPakistan \n  136,372 \n562 \n \n77 \n \n253 \n \n232 \n \n\n \nPunjab \n78,387 \n252 \n25 \n109 \n118 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nSindh \n  32,104 \n226 \n \n37 \n \n95 \n \n94 \n \n\nNWFP \n18,925 \n71 \n12 \n38 \n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nBalochistan \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n6,956 \n13 \n2 \n11 \n\u2014 \n\n  242,000 \n\n  311,000 \n\n 142,000 \n\n266,000 \n\n  535,000 \n\n\u2014  =  not available. \nNWFP  =  North-West  Frontier  Province,  TEVT  =  technical  education  and  vocational  training,  TVTC  =  technical \nand vocational training center. \nSource: ADB. 2003. Skills Development Reform Project. Manila (TA 4149-PAK). \n\n \n\nThe problems of Balochistan\u2019s TEVT sector are not only confined to the distribution and \n2. \nnumber  of  institutions,  but  include  poor  efficiency  of  TEVT  institutions.  In  Balochistan, \napproximately  350  enterprises  are  currently  operating  and  three  new  industrial  estates  are \nunder construction. The market survey7 revealed that the new industrial estates would result in \nmore  demand  for  technicians  and  skilled/semiskilled  workers.8  However,  the  supply  of  labor \nforce  is  insufficient.  The  two  polytechnics  and  11  technical  and  vocational  training  centers \n(TVTCs)  are  located  in  areas  remote  from  the  new  industrial  estates.  Enrollment  in  the \npolytechnics  exceeds  the  intake  capacity  by  approximately  310%.  Overcrowded  classes, \noutdated facilities and equipment, and inexperienced teachers inevitably result in lower quality \nof education, is reflected in the low completion rate of approximately 30\u201340%. The situation in \nTVTCs is much better with completion rates at over 75%. \n \nThe  insufficient  physical  capacity  of  TEVT  institutions,  high  internal  inefficiency  as  a \n3. \nresult of low quality of TEVT, and high external inefficiency due insufficient skill level warrant the \nnecessity  for  interventions  through  further  investment  in  the  TEVT  sector.  As  Table  A14.2 \nindicates, while more TEVT institutions are in private sector, more students and trainees were \nenrolled  in  the  public  sector  in  2001.  On  average,  one  TEVT  institution  in  the  public  sector \nenrolls  more  students  and  trainees  than  in  the  private  sector,  making  the  public  sector  more \nefficient.  Also,  in  the  absence  of  private  polytechnics,  the  government  must  invest  in  public \n\n                                                 \n7  Asian Development Bank. 2003.

Skills Development Reform Project. Manila (TA 4149-PAK). \n\n \nConsideration of Design Alternatives. The Project faced mainly two options: either to \n4. \nsupport a large-scale expansion given the Government\u2019s ambitious plan of providing access to \nTEVT  at  the  district  and  tehsil  levels,  or  to  focus  more  on  ensuring  effective  functioning  of \nexisting  facilities  before  embarking  on  a  large-scale  expansion.  While  support  for  large-scale \nexpansion would be in line with the Government\u2019s policy stipulation under the perspective plan \n2001\u20132011  and  education  sector  reform  (2001\u20132005),  and  would  receive  big  buy-in  from  the \nprovincial  government  of  Balochistan  (PGB),  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  sustain  such  an \napproach  due  to  limited  budgets  available  for  essential  recurrent  expenditures  and  lack  of \neffective models of TEVT institutions. The Project has therefore taken a middle path of cautious \nexpansion with a strong emphasis on consolidating existing TEVT institutions. Some expansion \nis  necessary  as  Balochistan  lags  Punjab  and  Sindh  significantly  in  terms  of  access  to  TEVT, \nparticularly  among  women  and  the  rural  poor.  The  balance  between  cautious  expansion  and \nconsolidation allows PGB to improve the quality and efficiency of existing TEVT institutions with \nlimited expansion in the most viable towns and districts, focusing on women and rural poor. \n \n5. \nAn  investment  loan  modality  is  proposed  since  PGB  is  not  yet  ready  to  embark  on  a \nmore complex design. Given the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the \ntwo previous projects for TEVT, addressing the persisting problems that inflict the TEVT sector \nis important. First, a project approach allows a simple design with a strong emphasis on policy \nreform. Second, efforts across Pakistan to bring TEVT institutions under one organization will be \nsupported. Punjab is leading in this effort through its effort to bring all TEVT activities under the \ntechnical  education  and  vocational  training  authority  and  other  provinces  are  watching  this \ndevelopment  closely.  PGB  is  also  considering  merging  technical  education  under  the \nDepartment  of  Education  and  technical  and  vocational  training  under  the  Department  of \nIndustries. Third,  the  devolution  policy  is  affecting  many  government  services,  but  has  not  yet \naffected  TEVT  provision.  Therefore,  a  conducive  environment  is  needed  for  PGB  to  allow \ngreater  autonomy  to  TEVT  institutions  and  TEVT  institutions  to  prepare  to  assume  greater \nresponsibilities  to  become  more  competitive  and  responsive  to  labor  market  needs.  Finally, \nsome of the fundamental elements necessary to enhance the effectiveness of TEVT institutions \nsuch as public-private partnership, counseling services, and exposure of teachers to industries \ncan be achieved under a relatively simple investment loan. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n51\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  achieve  consolidation  with  cautious  expansion.  The  first \n6. \ncomponent of institutional development is key to enhancing the capacity of TEVT institutions to \nbecome more responsive to labor market needs through greater autonomy, performance-based \nmanagement,  and  management  development  programs.  The  second  component  supports \nquality enhancement through training of teachers and competency-based training (CBT), which \nis  already  supported  by  the  National  Institute  for  Science  and  Technical  Education,  an  apex \nbody  assigned  to  upgrade  qualifications  of  TEVT  teachers.  CBT  will  also  allow  training  to  be \naligned  with  the  needs  of  the  private  sector  and  industries.  The  Project  also  provides \nappropriate materials to support this approach. The third component supports access and equity \nby  establishing  equivalency  and  certification,  which  will  benefit  many  people  who  have  had \nexperience  and  training  and  want  recognition  either  to  get  further  training  or  to  seek  better \npaying  jobs.  This  component  also  provides  opportunities  to  out-of-school  youth  and  adults  to \nseek  livelihood  training  appropriate  to  their  employment  needs.  With  limited  support  to  new \ninstitutions,  access  to  polytechnics  and  technical  and  vocational  training  centers  will  be \nenhanced. \n \n7. \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the economic viability and efficiency of \nthe investment under the Project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 25 years was \nestimated.  Three  major  streams  of  economic  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  are  identified, \nnamely  (i)  increased  access  to  TEVT  institutions,  (ii)  improved  internal  efficiency,  and  (iii) \nimproved external efficiency. The impacts of the three educational improvements are presented \nin  monetary  values  by  utilizing  estimated  future  salary  increments9  of  TEVT  students  and \ntrainees as a result of completing an additional year of TEVT under the Project. \n \n8. \nIncrease  in  access  is  represented  by  enrollment  growth  resulting  from  the  newly \nestablished  TEVT  institutions,  technologies,  training  programs,  and  courses.  The  Project \ncreates  additional  intake  capacity  in  the  TEVT  sector:  1,200  additional  annual  enrollees  in \npolytechnics,  700  in  TVTCs  and  colleges,  and  4,000  in  short-term  training  courses  and \nprograms. The students in polytechnics and TVTCs learn better skills and appropriate ethos as \na  future  workforce  within  a  year,  giving  them  an  assumed  increase  in  their  annual  earning  of \n$83 throughout their working lives. Similarly, the trainees in short courses will have increments \nof $9 to their salary throughout their working lives. \n \n9. \nImprovement in internal efficiency is measured  by the difference in completion rates of \npolytechnics  between  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  based  on  an  assumption  that  the \nnewly designed courses and better institutional management will have a positive impact on the \neffectiveness of delivery of education and training, and hence result in a better completion rate. \nDuring the Project, the completion rate in polytechnics is estimated to improve by approximately \n20%,  gradually  from  46%  to  55%.  The  full  completion  of  1-year  polytechnics  education  is \nassumed to increase annual earnings by $83 throughout the graduates\u2019 working lives. \n \n10. \nImproved  external  efficiency  is  measured  by  the  difference  in  employment  rate  of  the \ngraduates and completers of TEVT between the with- and without-project scenario based on the \nassumption  that  that  new  educational  contents,  new  institutional  management  system,  and \ncounseling  guidance  will  create  more  opportunities  for  employments.  Currently,  70%  of \ngraduates and completers cannot obtain a job immediately after graduation and completion, and \nhave to wait for approximately 2 years to be employed. During the Project, the employment rate \nof the graduates and completers is expected to rise gradually from 30% to 60%. In other words, \n\n                                                 \n9  Earning  level  was  estimated  by  using  earning  functions  developed  by  Zafar  Mueen  Nasir  and  Hina  Nazli  in \nEducation  and  Earnings  in  Pakistan,  Research  Report  No.  177,  Pakistan  Institute  of  Development  Economics. \n2000.  The  function  indicates  that  a  secondary  school  pupil  will  receive  an  average  increment  of  $83  per  year \nthroughout his/her working life by studying an additional year in an educational institution at between the ages of 18 \nand 20. \n\n \n\n\f 52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nthe Project saves 30% of graduates and completers from human resource wastage each year \nand allows them to generate income for the economy. The saving of a polytechnic graduate, a \nTVTC completer, and a nonformal livelihood training completer from human resource wastage \nbenefits the economy by $2,815, $2,454, and $458 per year respectively. \n \n11. \nThe  three  major  streams  of  economic  costs  are  (i)  investment  cost  of  the  Project,  (ii) \nrecurrent  cost,  and  (iii)  private  and  opportunity  costs.  The  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$39.7  million.  Recurrent  cost  is  represented  per  pupil,  which  is  necessary  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  TEVT  institutions  established  by  the  Project.  Per  capita  recurrent  cost  is \nestimated at $263 for a polytechnics student, $123 for a TVTC trainee, and $10 for a short-term \ntraining  program  trainee.  Private  cost  includes  the  out-of-pocket  expenses  of  students  and \ntrainees  necessary  to  continue  TEVT  and  is  estimated  at  $33  per  year.10  Opportunity  cost  is \nequivalent  to  the  income  that  a  student  or  trainee  would  otherwise  receive  if  he/she  does  not \nstudy in TEVT institution. Opportunity cost is estimated at $1,145 for both a polytechnics student \nand a TVTC trainee. Private cost and opportunity cost of a short-term training program trainee \nare assumed to be zero, since locally provided training does not incur considerable private cost \nand the majority of the trainees are likely to be unemployed. \n \n12. \nThe Project is estimated to yield a net present value of $13 million assuming a discount \nrate  of  12.0%  and  an  EIRR  of  12.9%.  The  summary  result  is  presented  in  Table  A14.3.  The \nactual  EIRR  is  likely  to  be  somewhat  higher  reflecting  positive  externalities  and  longer  term \nintergenerational social benefits that come with improved TEVT, which may be reflected through \npositive  parental  attitudes  to  children\u2019s  education  and  diligent  work  ethics,  to  which  assigning \nmonetary values is difficult. No allowance is made for the fact that the improvements in TEVT \nwill  encourage  students  and  trainees  to  have  higher  esteem  and  wider  exposure  to  different \ntechnologies and skills, which lead to better performance and productivity in the labor market. \n \n13. \nA sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the basis of alternative assumptions regarding \nthe extent to which the project achieves improved access, and internal and external efficiency. \nThe  Project\u2019s  targets  for  the  respective  three  improvements  are  5,900  additional  enrollment11 \nper  year,  55%  in  completion,  and  60%  in  employment  rate.  For  an  analytical  purpose,  the \nalternative  assumptions  were  tested  by  employing  extreme  values,  in  that  the  low  case \nrepresents  the  degree  of  improvement  in  respective  areas  and  would  be  50%  lower  than  the \ntarget, and the high case 50 % higher. In other words, in the low case, the target for additional \nenrollment, the completion rates and the employment rate of graduates/completers are reduced \nto 2,950, 51% and 45% respectively, while for the high case, they are increased to 8,850, 60%, \nand 75% respectively. The results are shown in Table A14.4. \n \nThe results indicate that the Project will bring substantial benefits to the economy when \n14. \nimprovement in the three areas exceeds the targets. However, an excessive increase in access \nmay  replicate  the  current  situation  where  the  enrolment  exceeds  the  capacity,  and  hence \novercrowded classes result in lower quality of education and training. The results also indicate \nthat  the  Project  is  highly  sensitive  to  access  and  external  efficiency.  A  small  decline  in  the \ndegree of improvement in access and external efficiency could render the Project economically \nnonviable. The calculation indicates that the Project must at least achieve 97% of the targeted \nincrease in access. New construction of polytechnics and TVTCs in the industrial areas under \nthe Project and utilization of double shift classes will contribute to achieving the minimum target. \nSimilarly, the degree of improvement in internal and external efficiency must be more than 75% \nand 87% respectively.

The direct beneficiaries of the Project are students and \ntrainees  in polytechnics,  TVTCs,  and  training  programs.  The  poverty  line  in  Pakistan  is  based \non  a  caloric  norm  of  2,530  calories  per  adult  daily  equivalent  and  minimum  nonfood \nrequirements; it approximates $160 per year12. Based on the earning simulation, completion of 1 \nyear of training in TVTCs is estimated to bring about $166 more salary per year than for those \nwithout  training.  Similarly,  completion  of  3-year  technical  education  in  polytechnics  is  likely  to \nbring about $500 more salary than those without equivalent education would receive. Thus, the \nsalary  increments  as  a  result  of  completion  of  polytechnic  education  and  training  programs  in \nTVTC, coupled with successful employment in the labor market, will increase earning level well \nabove the poverty line. \n \n16. \nIn  the  absence  of  statistical  data  on  the  poverty  profile  of  students  and  trainees, \nassumed the proportion of students and trainees from poor families are assumed to be at least \nthe  same  as  the  proportion  of  the  poor  in  the  province.  Also,  the  current  student  selection \nprocedures  in  polytechnics  and  the  geographical  distribution  of  TVTCs  are  assumed  to  reflect \nthe  rural  and  urban  distribution  of  the  provincial  population  in  enrolment.  Based  on  the \nassumptions, approximately 24% of students and trainees are assumed to be from urban areas \nand  76%  from  rural  areas  in  1999;  poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at  28%  and  24%  for  urban \nand rural regions in 2001. Thus approximately 25\u201326% of the students and trainees are likely to \nbe from poor families (Table A14.6). \n \n\nTable A14.5: Population and Poverty in Balochistan \n\n(%) \n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nPopulation (A) \nPoverty Incidence in Region (B) \nPoverty Incidence in Province (AxB) \nSources:  Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2003.

The  estimated  poverty  incidence  figure  for  the \nstudents and trainees in polytechnics and TVTCs could be, however, underestimated for three \nreasons.  Firstly,  the  historical  trends  of  poverty  incidence  in  other  studies  suggest  that  the \npoverty  incidence  in  Balochistan  has  been  increasing  and,  therefore,  the  figure  in  the  project \ncommencement  year  is  likely  to  be  much  higher  than  26%.  Secondly,  the  provincial  poverty \nreduction  strategy  of  Balochistan  notes  that  the  poverty  incidence  figure  for  Balochistan  is \n\u201clargely a statistical aberration\u201d, and if the past trends had continued, poverty would have risen \nto  41.3%  in  1998/99.  Thirdly,  applicants  to  TEVT  programs  are  more  likely  to  be  from  poorer \nfamilies  than  those  applying  to  general  education,  as  financial  difficulties  and  lack  of  family \nsupport  for  education  generally  make  it  difficult  for  children  to  be  successful  in  the  general \neducation stream and eventually resort to TEVT as their second life option. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2003.

DOE administers a college of technology \nand  a  polytechnic  institute,  while  DOLM  administers  TVTCs  and  nonformal  training  programs. \nBoth  DOE  and  DOLM  received  a  constant  proportion  of  the  provincial  budget,  approximately \n17% and 1% respectively between fiscal year (FY)2001 and FY2003. In FY2004, however, as a \nresult  of  administrative  and  financial  devolution  in  PGB,  the  DOE  budget  was  substantially \nreduced because the majority of the DOE recurrent budget, mainly for staff salary and operation \nand maintenance of line institutions and agencies, which was previously allocated through DOE \nto education institutions, is now directly allocated to the district governments13. \n \n\n Development Budget \n Recurrent Budget \n\nItem \nBalochistan Provincial Government \n\nTable A14.6: Education, Labor, and Human Resources Budget FY2001\u20132004 \n(PRs million) \n \nFY2001 \n  32,087 \n6,573  \n \n  25,514  \n4,376  \n \n14 \n \n431  \n \n3,945  \n \n92  \n \n0 \n \n3  \n \n88  \n \n\nFY2002 \n30,446 \n4,096  \n26,350  \n5,242  \n17 \n431  \n4,811  \n109  \n0 \n3  \n106  \n\nFY2003 \n  34,934 \n  6,467  \n  28,467  \n  6,079  \n \n17 \n  1,234  \n  4,845  \n139  \n \n1 \n \n \n32  \n107  \n \n\nFY2004 \n  43,954 \n9,300  \n \n  34,653  \n2,346  \n \n \n5 \n1,174  \n \n1,172  \n \n192  \n \n1 \n \n58  \n \n134  \n \n\nDepartment of Education \nProportion to Government Expenditure (%) \n\nDepartment of Labor and Manpower  \nProportion to Government Expenditure (%) \n\nDevelopment Budget \nRecurrent Budget \n\n \n   Recurrent Budget \n\n Development Budget \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nFY = fiscal year. \nNote:  \n\n  Due  to  limited  availability  of  budget  records,  the  recurrent  budget  figures  are  from  original  budget  and \ndevelopment budget figures from revised budget. \nSource:    Finance Department, Provincial Government of Balochistan. \n \n \n19. \nDespite  the  devolution,  PGB  still  directly  allocates  the  recurrent  budget  to  TEVT \ninstitutions.

The  sector  budget  has  been  generally  increasing  by \nmore than 10% annually for the last 4 financial years.

Due  to  limited \navailability of official long-term provincial budget forecasts and plans, and the major changes in \nbudget allocation arrangements in recent years, the financial analysis is based on the historical \nbudget trend of the TEVT sector and priority set for TEVT under the 10-year perspective plan \nand  education  sector  reform  for  2001\u20132005.  The  Project  is  expected  to  incur  recurrent \nexpenditure  at  approximately  PRs36  million  after  the  6-year  project  implementation  period, \nwhich  consists  of  PRs18  million  from  DOE-administered  polytechnics  and  organizations,  and \nPRs18 million from DOLM-administered TEVT facilities and activities. To finance the additional \ncost, the TEVT budget under DOE  needs to be increased annually by  5% (40% increase in 6 \nyears) and the TEVT budget under DOLM by 2% (about 15% increase in 6 years) during the 6-\nyear  project  implementation  period.  Comparing  the  past  budget  trends,  which  were  constantly \nabove 10%, the annual increase at 5% in the TEVT budget under DOE and 2% for the TVTE \nbudget  under  DOLM  is  most  likely  to  be  achievable.  Also,  PGB  agrees  to  make  a  legal \ncommitment to allocate budget for the increased recurrent expenditure. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n57\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \n\nSector identified as a national \n\n \n\n Yes\n\nCountry \ncountry poverty partnership agreement \n\nidentified  as  a  national  priority \n\nin\n\n Yes \n\n \n\nin \n\n No \n\n No  \n\npoverty\n\ncountry \n\npriority \nanalysis  \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nGiven  the  strong  linkage  between  poverty  and  low  level  of  human  development  as  measured  by  the  human \ndevelopment  index  (HDI),  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  set  a  major  objective  to  accelerate  gross  domestic \nproduct  growth,  reduce  unemployment,  and  reduce  poverty  in  its  Ten-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan.  In  its \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  of  December  2003,  the  Government  recognizes  education  as  a  key \ningredient for sustainable economic growth. Education is seen as a key to better quality of life, as well as a means to \nprovide  employable  skills  to  prepare  the  population  for  employment  and  for  future  development  of  the  country.  In \nparticular,  the  Government  recognizes  of  basic  education  and  skills  development  as  key  elements  of  poverty \nreduction. The plan and PRSP clearly identify priority areas for the education sector: (i) improving the literacy rate, (ii) \naccomplishing  Education  For  All,  (iii)  improving  the  participation  rate  at  the  secondary  level,  (iv)  producing  higher \neducation  graduates  responsive  to  the  socioeconomic  and  technical  needs  of  the  country,  and  (v)  improving  the \nquality of education. \n \nTechnical  education  and  vocational  training  (TEVT)  figures  prominently  in  the  development  plan  and  PRSP  as  a \nstrategy  to  produce  skilled  human  resources  that  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness.  In  the  National \nEducation  Policy,  the  Government  sets  specific  targets  to  expand  TEVT  facilities  and  improve  opportunities  for \nenrollment in quality TEVT programs. In addition to establishing more polytechnic and monotechnic institutes across \nthe country, especially in Balochistan where TEVT facilities and opportunities are still limited, the Government plans \nto  introduce  job-oriented  education  and  training  at  selected  secondary  schools  throughout  the  country.  To  expand \nthe base of the country\u2019s skilled workforce, the Government has introduced a technical stream in 1,100 high schools \nwith the aim of increasing the number of matriculation pass students who choose to study technical, commercial, and \nvocational subjects from 35% at present to 50% by 2011. In addition, existing facilities at high schools, technical and \nvocational  training  centers,  commercial  colleges,  and  polytechnic  institutes  are  being  used  to  conduct  evening \nprograms for out-of-school youth and dropouts to provide them with employable skills. These initiatives and activities \ndirectly  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and  national  priority  to  reduce  poverty  by  providing  quality  technical \neducation and vocational training, and expanding opportunities for accessing TEVT. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  Balochistan  by  providing  high-quality,  relevant  skills  development \nprograms and increasing access and equity to TEVT. One of the major objectives of the Project is to enhance access \nand equity to TEVT with a greater focus on women and rural poor. The Project will promote employment in small and \nmedium enterprises by facilitating graduates\u2019 access to microcredit. \n \nThe  proposed  establishment  of  two  new  polytechnic  institutes  in  Gwadar  (boys)  and  Kzudar  (girls),  two  potential \ngrowth  centers,  will  greatly  enhance  access  to  TEVT.  Together  with  the  two  existing  polytechnic  institutes,  the \npolytechnics will produce about 1,000 technicians per year when in full operation. Many more rural poor students will \nbenefit from the programs and facilities, as evening shifts will be introduced as well as nonformal livelihood training \nprograms to cater mainly to women. About 500 polytechnic graduates will be able to access microcredit to start their \nown businesses. Considering that these TEVT graduates will be able to provide financial support to their families and \ngenerate employment for other people in the communities, the economic impact and benefits will be substantial.  \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n                \n\n     Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\nIn the past decade the incidence of poverty in Pakistan has increased sharply due to slow economic growth, decline \nin  development  spending,  and  lower  agricultural  outputs  because  of  a  severe  drought.  The  proportion  of  the \npopulation living below the poverty line (defined by an intake of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day for the \nequivalent  of  PRs670  per  capita  per  month  in  1999  value)  has  increased  from  26.6%  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  1993  to \n32.1%  in  FY2001,  and  deteriorated  further  to  38.2%  in  FY2003.  Poverty  in  rural  areas  is  normally  higher  than  in \nurban  areas;  more  than  75%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas.  Although  poverty  increased  in  all  four  provinces  of \nPakistan during this period, the provincial rates varied. In FY1999 urban Sindh had the lowest level of poverty (16%), \nwhile  rural  NWFP  had  the  highest  incidence  (42%).  In  comparison  to  NWFP,  Balochistan  has  a  lower  poverty \nincidence  (22.5).  Characteristics  of  the  poor  in  Pakistan  include  illiteracy,  large  family  size,  nonworking  heads  of \nhouseholds,  and  lack  of  physical  assets  such  as  land  or  livestock.  Studies  show  that  poverty  incidence  of  highest \namong  household  heads  with  occupations  such  as  day  laborer  in  agriculture,  construction,  trade,  and  transport \nsectors. It is also high among the self-employed, including urban street vendors and rural sharecroppers. \n\n \n\n\f 58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \nIn addition to the slowdown in economic growth and negligible increase in per capita income, poverty increase was \nalso  attributed  to  (i)  limited  job  growth  and  absorptive  capacity  of  the  formal  sector;  (ii)  limited  opportunities  for \nunskilled  youth  to  obtain  on-the-job  training  and  skills;  and  (iii)  low  quality  of  social  services,  particularly  education \nand health services. \n \nAt the individual and family level, education is the most important factor distinguishing the poor from the non-poor\u2014\nthe  proportion  of  literate  household  heads  in  poor  households  was  almost  half  that  in  non-poor  households. \nAccording to Social Development in Pakistan towards Poverty Reduction, access to employment in urban Pakistan \nreduces  the  incidence  of  poverty  by  45%,  while  education  and  physical  assets  contribute  another  12%  and  9% \nreduction respectively. Investing in education and training that prepares students, including those who have missed \nopportunities  in  formal  education,  for  employment  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  reducing  poverty,  especially  among \ndisadvantaged groups who lack educational opportunities due to lack of facilities in or near their villages and districts. \n \nEducational opportunities are limited especially in rural areas. The Mahbub-ul-Haq Center for Human Development \nhas  developed  a  broad  poverty  index  for  Pakistan  that  takes  into  account  deprivation  in  education  and  health,  in \naddition to income. Among the three areas, poverty of education opportunities consistently ranked the highest from \n77% in 1970 to 58% in 1995. Pakistan has approximately 41 million adult illiterates and more are being added every \nyear.  Less  than  50%  of  girls  in  the  10\u201314-year  age  group  in  the  rural  areas  are  in  school,  and  over  30%  of  all \nchildren are unlikely to attend school in the present situation.  \n \nThe  Project  will  expand  educational  opportunities  in  TEVT  in  rural  areas  for  livelihood  programs  for  out-of-school \nyouths  and  adults  who  want  to  acquire  skills  for  employment  and  to  start  their  own  business.  Nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will plan and implement the livelihood programs. Innovative features such as identification of \ntraining needs and trades for self-employment will meet local needs as well as those of the outside market. Linkages \nwith the microcredit project supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will allow TEVT graduates to access \nmicrocredit  facilities  to  start  small  businesses  and  help  generate  income  and  employment  in  the  communities.  All \nthese  measures  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  provinces  especially  in  rural  areas  where  educational  opportunities \nare still very limited. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n \n\n  No   \n  No \n\n  Yes   \n  Yes   \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe Project was formulated based on extensive consultations with all stakeholders including the federal Government, \nthe  provincial  government  of  Balochistan,  and  key  government  agencies  responsible  for  TEVT  planning  and \nmanagement.  In  Balochistan,  consultations  were  held  with  key  officials  of  the  departments  of  education,  labor  and \nmanpower,  fisheries,  and  mines  and  minerals;  Board  of  Intermediate  and  Secondary  Education;  and  other  related \nagencies. Consultations were also held with NGOs and some representatives from TEVT institutions.  \n \nInvolving  NGOs  to  conduct  situation  analysis  on  vocational  training  needs  and  trades  for  self-employment  through \nrelevant  stakeholder  analysis  will \nthe \nTEVT/livelihood programs. The  involvement of the various stakeholders in particular NGOs, potential trainees, and \nthe private sector will enable TEVT institutions to implement the activities in a participatory manner. \n\nfacilitate  participatory  processes \n\nfor  designing  and \n\nimplementing \n\nD.  \n\nGender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender  discrimination  is  a  key  factor  associated  with  poverty.  Incidence  of  poverty  among  women  is  higher \ncompared  with  men,  and  is  characterized  by  low  endowment  of  land  and  productive  assets,  unemployment, \ndiscrimination  in  the  labor  market,  and  limited  access  to  economic  options  and  political  process.  Pakistani  women \nare  generally  discriminated  against  in  almost  all  spheres  of  life,  but  the  impact  of  discrimination  in  the  education \nsector  is  most  profound.  The  female  literacy  rate  is  only  29%  compared  with  55%  for  men.  Gender  inequality  in \neducational  opportunities  is  worse  in  Balochistan  than  in  the  other  provinces  and  the  national  average.  TEVT \nfacilities and opportunities for women are equally limited. O f the 77 polytechnic institutes in the country only 10 are \nfor  women. The situation is somewhat better at the technical and vocational training level below polytechnics,  with \nthe  number  of  vocational  training  centers  for  girls  almost equal  to  that  for  boys.  However,  the  number  of  trades  or \ntechnologies  offered  by  the  centers  for  girls  is  limited  and  enrollment  is  also  lower  in  the  training  centers  for  girls. \nApart from cultural factors, socioeconomic factors play a role. In some rural training centers for girls, lack of public \ntransportation services presents a big obstacle, even preventing girls from enrolling. \n \nIn Balochistan the first Government Polytechnic Institute for Women (GPIW) was established under the ADB-funded \nTechnical Education Project in 2002. Enrollments for the first 2 years closely approximate the project targets. As the \npolytechnic becomes better known and graduates prove successful, more students are likely to enroll. Based on the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n59\n\ninitial  response,  GPIW  at  Quetta  expects  demand  for  places  at  the  polytechnic  to  significantly  increase  in  the  next \nfew  years.  Enrollments  at  GPIW  are  expected  to  reach  500  when  the  third  year  courses  are  offered  and  most \nprograms are fully operational in 2004. However, opportunities for skilled and semiskilled vocational training for girls \nare still limited. Of the 11 technical training centers and vocational training centers, only one is for girls. The province \nrealizes  the  urgent  need  to  address  the  issue  and  wants  to  provide  greater  opportunities  to  women  in  the  training \ncenters under the Project. \n \nGender Plan \n\n \n\nEstablishment  of  a  new  polytechnic  and  other  measures  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  expand \nopportunities for girls/women to take up TEVT, especially in rural areas. Where feasible, the Project will also support \nmainstreaming gender needs. The following is a summary of interventions: \n\n(i)  Two  new  polytechnics,  one  for  girls  in  Khuzdar  and  another  for  boys  in  Gwadar,  will  be  established  in \nBalochistan.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  three  new  training  centers  for  women.  New \ntechnologies to be introduced are computer and information technology, telecommunication technology, and \nbiotechnology.  With  these  added  to  the  existing  programs,  girls  will  have  greater  exposure  to  emerging \ntechnologies and better employment prospects.  \n\n(ii)  New  initiatives  will  be  introduced  to  enable  girls  as  well  as  boys  undergoing  TEVT  programs  to  gain \nexperience  through  on-the-job  training  in  industries  and  introduction  of  microcredit  and  entrepreneurship \ntraining  to  prepare  them  for  self-employment.  A  career  guidance  and  job  placement  center  will  help  girls \nprepare for jobs, and provide assistance for job search and job placement upon graduation. \n\n(iii)  Nonformal livelihood skills improvement programs for rural people will include girls and women. At least half \nof  the  targeted  20,000  trainees  of  the  livelihood  program  will  be  girls/women.  The  NGOs  will  identify \nappropriate training needs for new skills and upgrading traditional skills. \n\n(iv)  To  enable  poor  students  from  rural/remote  areas  to  attend  TEVT  institutions,  especially  female  students, \ntraining  will  be  conducted  in  the  communities  to  maximize  participation    by  women.  Where  training  is  not \npossible in the community, provision for accommodation in the form of student hostels or other arrangements \nwill be made. \n\n(v)  The project management unit and the partner NGOs will involve the female representatives of the union and \ndistrict  councils  in  situation  analysis,  planning,  and  implementation  of  TEVT  and  livelihood  programs  in  the \nrespective union and district councils. The project management unit will include women managers.  \n\n(vi)  A  national  consultant  for  gender  and  development  will  work  with  the  project  implementation  unit  and  the \n\npartner NGOs to develop a detailed gender action plan to operationalize the Gender Plan. \n\n(vii)   A  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be  developed  and  institutionalized  to  assess \nthe benefits and impact of the Project in terms of employment generation, incomes of graduates, and other \nrelated indicators by gender and socioeconomic group. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nItem \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\nResettlement \n\n  Significant \n\nImprovement  of  existing  facilities  will  be  made  in  the  same \ncompound.
