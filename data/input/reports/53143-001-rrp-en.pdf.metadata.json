THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $60,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Maxwealth Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (MWFL) for \nthe Industrial and Municipal Wastewater Treatment Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-tenor financing to \nMWFL for lease finance to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for industrial and municipal \nwastewater treatment in the PRC. ADB financing will meet MWFL\u2019s requirements for long-term \nfunding, which is in short supply in the PRC, and will enable MWFL to provide long-tenor lease \nfinance to WWTPs. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Economic overview. The PRC has experienced strong economic growth since 1980. \nDuring 1980\u20132014, gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 9.7% per year and per capita \nincome increased by 8.6% per year.1 Since 2014, the PRC economy has continued to transition \nto a more sustainable growth path, and the government has advanced wide-ranging reforms. The \nreal GDP growth rate slowed to 6.8% in 2017 and 6.6% in 2018, and ADB estimates that GDP \ngrowth will slow further to 6.3% in 2019 and 6.1% in 2020.2 The International Monetary Fund \nprojects a gradual slowdown to a real GDP growth rate of 5.6% in 2023.3 \n \n4.  Water sector overview. Rapid economic development and massive urbanization in the \nPRC have been accompanied by worsening water pollution. PRC is one of the most water \nstressed countries in the world, with per capita water resources of 2,100 cubic meters (m3) per \nyear,4 or 25% of the global average.5 Severe pollution of surface water bodies and groundwater, \nas  well  as  climate-related  events,  exacerbate  water  scarcity.  Total  wastewater  discharge \nincreased by 65% from 41.5 billion m3 per year in 2000 to 69.5 billion m3 per year in 2013,6 with \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) contributing to 60% of the total water \npollution in the country. Only 56% of the PRC\u2019s wastewater is treated.7 The problem is more acute \nin coastal provinces with more developed private economies and a larger number of MSMEs, \nsuch as Zhejiang, which ranked second, and Jiangsu, which ranked fourth among PRC provinces \nin  terms  of  wastewater  discharge  volume  in  2013. To  cut  costs, some  MSMEs  discharge \nuntreated wastewater directly into the river or ground, which leads to severe water pollution \nproblems. Places with a high concentration of MSMEs also attract many migrant workers, adding \nto the significant environmental pressure, because planning for water demand and wastewater \ntreatment capacity is often based on official population statistics, which do not include migrants. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

The  government  has  tightened  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  address  the \nincreasingly serious levels of water pollution across the country. The Environmental Protection \nLaw, 2015; the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, 2015; and the Regulations \non Assessment of Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, 2016 (jointly published by \n11 ministries) are key documents for environmental protection in the PRC. The 2016 regulations \nset standards to evaluate the implementation status of water pollution control actions and their \neffectiveness against effluent discharge standards for 2017\u20132020.8 The PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year \nPlan  continues  and  strengthens  previous  sector  reforms  for  better  water  and  wastewater \ncoverage and treatment and for integrated water resources management at the water catchment \nlevel, including stormwater management (sponge cities) and water conservation.9 During 2000\u2013\n2018, the PRC made remarkable progress in expanding municipal and industrial wastewater \ninfrastructure  by  increasing  treatment  capacity  six-fold,  tripling  the  length  of  the  collection \nnetworks, and raising wastewater discharge standards. The PRC\u2019s primary gauge for wastewater \ndischarge standards of 10 milligrams of biochemical oxygen demand per liter for Grade 1A and \n20 milligrams per liter for Grade 1B are stricter than those of Europe (25 milligrams per liter) and \nthe United States (a 30-day average of 30 milligrams per liter). Despite notable progress, there is \nstill a major gap between the 56% wastewater treatment coverage in the PRC and the 100% \ncoverage in developed countries such as the Republic of Korea and the United States (footnote \n9). \n6.  Leasing industry overview. Leasing provides a good solution for long-term wastewater \ntreatment equipment financing as banks usually do not recognize movable assets, such as \nequipment, as collateral. The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing rapidly, targeting a \nfinancing gap that traditional bank financing does not address. New leasing sales in the PRC \nexpanded from $21.88 billion in 2008 to $265.68 billion in 2017, representing a compound annual \ngrowth rate of 31.97%.10 Despite rapid growth, the PRC\u2019s financial leasing industry still needs \nfurther development. The lease penetration rate, measured as a percentage of lease finance to \ntotal GDP, was 2.21% in the PRC in 2017, ranking it 12th among 50 countries and indicating \nample room for future growth. With total outstanding lease receivables of CNY6.55 trillion in 2018, \nthe leasing industry is also much smaller than the banking industry, which had total outstanding \nloans of CNY108.56 trillion in the same year. \n \n7.  Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations have been actively supporting leasing in the \nPRC given its underdevelopment and need for long-tenor financing, targeting a diverse range of \ndevelopment subsectors. ADB has provided $475 million in debt to four PRC financial leasing \ncompanies (FLCs) for clean bus leasing since 2013.11 ADB has also provided $75 million for \nhealth care leasing and $60 million for SME lease finance.12 In 2018, ADB approved a loan of \n                                                \n8  National Development and Reform Commission et al. 2016.

The PRC\u2019s leasing industry is still in the \nearly stages of development. Most funding is available to companies on a 1-year tenor basis. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n18.  Enhancing MWFL\u2019s environmental and social safeguard capacity and supporting \ngender equity. ADB will be the first international finance institution to provide financing to MWFL. \nAs a condition for disbursement, MWFL must establish an ESMS that meets the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will continue to work with MWFL throughout the \nADB investment period to enhance the company\u2019s safeguard capacity, support the company\u2019s \nadherence  to  high  safeguard  standards,  and  promote  gender-inclusive  measures  in  its \noperations. MWFL will appoint a gender champion to empower and help create opportunities for \nMWFL\u2019s female staff, including professional and life skills training. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n19.  Impacts. The project is expected to have the following development impacts: \n \n(i)  Water pollution reduced, leading to a more sustainable environment and \nimproved water quality. By providing lease finance to WWTPs, the project helps \nincrease wastewater treatment capacity and support technological upgrades to \nmeet the stricter wastewater treatment standard imposed by the Government of \nthe PRC since 2015. This will lead to improvement of the urban environment and \nbetter quality of life for residents, including migrant workers; and \n(ii)  Financial leasing industry developed. Despite rapid growth since 2008, the \nPRC\u2019s financial leasing industry is still underdeveloped, with a lower leasing \npenetration rate than other developed markets. Access to finance remains a \nchallenge for most leasing companies, particularly for long-tenor loans, and the \nproject will help alleviate this funding bottleneck. \n \n20.  Outcome. The outcome will be enhanced treatment capacity for industrial and municipal \nwastewater, which will benefit 2.2 million people in urban areas. \n \n ", "5 \n21.  Outputs. The outputs will be the following: \n(i)  MWFL\u2019s wastewater treatment lease operations expanded. MWFL will provide \nan additional $60 million in lease finance to at least XX industrial or municipal \nWWTPs; and \n(ii)  MWFL\u2019s  gender  inclusiveness  improved.  The  project  will  also  strengthen \nMWFL\u2019s inclusiveness in its operations with respect to its women staff. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n22.  Consistency with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (ii) making cities more livable.14 Under \nStrategy 2030, ADB will increase its emphasis on assisting developing member countries in \nimproving their environmental management, including efforts to improve water quality and foster \ngreen  economic  growth.  The  project  also  contributes  to  water  security  and  environmental \nconservation, thus supporting the building of livable cities that are green, competitive, resilient, \nand inclusive. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, \n2016\u20132020  as  it  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  to  manage  environmental \nchallenges to reduce water pollution, and to finance private sector projects with innovative \ntechnologies and business models to support the development of green cities (footnote 1). \n \n23.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project fully \nsupports ADB\u2019s water policy, which recognizes the importance of reversing the degradation of \nwater resources caused by agricultural, industrial, and municipal effluents.15 The project is also \naligned with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which commits to investments of $2.0 \nbillion\u2013$2.5 billion per year by 2020 and targets an additional $500 million per year for private \nsector lending.16 In addition, the project supports the Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020, which \nidentifies  green  cities  as  a  priority  theme  of  ADB  operations.17 Supporting  finance  sector \ndevelopment is a key focus of development assistance for ADB, and the project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Sector Operational Plan.18 The client selection and project design reflects ADB\u2019s \nexperience in the PRC leasing industry by selecting financial intermediaries that have proven \nexpertise in the targeted sector and augmenting the design by leveraging ADB-wide expertise of \nsector specialists and gender specialists in the early stages of structuring transactions. Lastly, the \nproject is aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, \n2013\u20132020.19 \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2018.

ADB has classified the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) as category FI for the environment and involuntary resettlement and category FI treated \nas C for Indigenous Peoples.20 \n \n25.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the investment\u2019s potential environmental and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with MWFL\u2019s existing and likely future WWTP lease finance portfolio, \nand  its  policies,  procedures,  commitment,  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement.  Due  diligence  found  that  while  the  installation  of  new  wastewater  treatment \nequipment is likely to have minimal or less adverse environmental impacts, WWTP operations \nmay  incur  impacts  from  effluent  discharge,  sludge  disposal,  odor,  and  noise,  as  well  as \noccupational health and safety risks. As the proposed project is for equipment leasing, the risk \nfrom climate change impact is expected to be low. Wastewater treatment can support climate \nchange adaptation by improving surface and ground water quality to enhance climate resilience, \nand support climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emission from untreated \nwastewater. MWFL\u2019s lease finance to WWTPs are not expected to involve new land acquisition \nand/or significant land acquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts, as the company only \nfinances WWTPs that have completed civil works. The government had already completed all \nland acquisition and resettlement for the WWTPs, most of which are SOEs, before MWFL\u2019s \nfinancing. MWFL will exclude lease projects involving construction of a new pipeline from the \nfinancing of the ADB loan. No subprojects are expected to be in areas populated by ethnic \nminorities, and no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected from MWFL\u2019s existing and likely \nfuture WWTP lease finance portfolio.21 \n \n26.  Based  on  due  diligence  findings,  ADB  has  identified  the  following  actions  to  be \nimplemented by MWFL: (i) adopt an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before first disbursement; (ii) apply \nADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list; (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and other social requirements, and abide by applicable \nnational  laws  and  regulations;  (iv)  screen  and  categorize  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement potential impacts and risks and impacts on indigenous peoples; (v) exclude from \nADB financing transactions that will likely have significant adverse environmental and social \nimpacts (category A) and those involving construction of new pipelines; (vi) conduct environment \nand social due diligence, and prepare and implement corrective action plans as required or \nexclude from ADB finance any subprojects with a compliance gap; (vii) appoint environment and \nsocial staff for day-to-day implementation of the ESMS; and (viii) develop staff capacity on the \nmanagement of environmental and social impacts and risks. The ESMS will set out requirements, \nas  applicable,  for  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. \nThe  ESMS  will  also  contain  requirements  for  information  disclosure,  consultation  with \nstakeholders, and grievance redress mechanism, in accordance with ADB requirements. MWFL \nwill  include  in  its  regular  reporting  information  to  ADB  (i)  the  nature  of  subprojects  and \ncategorization, (ii) compliance with the safeguard and social requirements, and (iii) compliance \nwith applicable national and international laws and standards. \n \n                                                \n20 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n21 Most of ADB\u2019s loan to MWFL will be used for WWTPs in Jiangsu Province, where ethnic minorities account for 0.5% \nof the total population and in Zhejiang Province, where ethnic minorities account for 0.9% of the total population. \n ", "7 \n27.  Some gender elements. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. MWFL will submit \nperiodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n28.  MWFL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n29.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of the \nPRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to MWFL.
