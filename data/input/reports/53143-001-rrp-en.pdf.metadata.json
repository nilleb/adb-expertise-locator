(MWFL) for \nthe  Industrial  and  Municipal  Wastewater  Treatment  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC). \n \n2. \nThe project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-tenor financing to \nMWFL  for  lease  finance  to  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  for  industrial  and  municipal \nwastewater treatment in the PRC. ADB financing will meet MWFL\u2019s requirements for long-term \nfunding, which is in short supply in the PRC, and will enable MWFL to provide long-tenor lease \nfinance to WWTPs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic  overview.  The  PRC  has  experienced  strong  economic  growth  since  1980. \nDuring 1980\u20132014, gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 9.7% per year and per capita \nincome increased by 8.6% per year.1 Since 2014, the PRC economy has continued to transition \nto a more sustainable growth path, and the government has advanced wide-ranging reforms. The \nreal GDP growth rate slowed to 6.8% in 2017 and 6.6% in 2018, and ADB estimates that GDP \ngrowth  will  slow  further  to  6.3%  in  2019  and  6.1%  in  2020.2 The  International  Monetary  Fund \nprojects a gradual slowdown to a real GDP growth rate of 5.6% in 2023.3 \n \n4. \nWater sector overview. Rapid economic development and massive urbanization in the \nPRC  have  been  accompanied  by  worsening  water  pollution.  PRC  is  one  of  the  most  water \nstressed countries in the world, with per capita water resources of 2,100 cubic meters (m3) per \nyear,4 or 25% of the global average.5 Severe pollution of surface water bodies and groundwater, \nas  well  as  climate-related  events,  exacerbate  water  scarcity.  Total  wastewater  discharge \nincreased by 65% from 41.5 billion m3 per year in 2000 to 69.5 billion m3 per year in 2013,6 with \nmicro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  contributing  to  60%  of  the  total  water \npollution in the country. Only 56% of the PRC\u2019s wastewater is treated.7 The problem is more acute \nin  coastal  provinces  with  more  developed  private  economies  and  a  larger  number  of  MSMEs, \nsuch as Zhejiang, which ranked second, and Jiangsu, which ranked fourth among PRC provinces \nin  terms  of  wastewater  discharge  volume  in  2013.  To  cut  costs,  some  MSMEs  discharge \nuntreated  wastewater  directly  into  the  river  or  ground,  which  leads  to  severe  water  pollution \nproblems. Places with a high concentration of MSMEs also attract many migrant workers, adding \nto the significant environmental pressure, because planning for water demand and wastewater \ntreatment capacity is often based on official population statistics, which do not include migrants. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2016.

IB-NET Database. https://database.ib-net.org (accessed 10 June 2019). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  has  tightened  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  address  the \n5. \nincreasingly serious levels of water pollution across the country. The Environmental Protection \nLaw, 2015; the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, 2015; and the Regulations \non Assessment of Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, 2016 (jointly published by \n11 ministries) are key documents for environmental protection in the PRC. The 2016 regulations \nset standards to evaluate the implementation status of water pollution control actions and their \neffectiveness  against  effluent  discharge  standards  for  2017\u20132020.8 The  PRC\u2019s  13th  Five-Year \nPlan  continues  and  strengthens  previous  sector  reforms  for  better  water  and  wastewater \ncoverage and treatment and for integrated water resources management at the water catchment \nlevel, including stormwater management (sponge cities) and water conservation.9 During 2000\u2013\n2018,  the  PRC  made  remarkable  progress  in  expanding  municipal  and  industrial  wastewater \ninfrastructure  by  increasing  treatment  capacity  six-fold,  tripling  the  length  of  the  collection \nnetworks, and raising wastewater discharge standards. The PRC\u2019s primary gauge for wastewater \ndischarge standards of 10 milligrams of biochemical oxygen demand per liter for Grade 1A and \n20 milligrams per liter for Grade 1B are stricter than those of Europe (25 milligrams per liter) and \nthe United States (a 30-day average of 30 milligrams per liter). Despite notable progress, there is \nstill  a  major  gap  between  the  56%  wastewater  treatment  coverage  in  the  PRC  and  the  100% \ncoverage in developed countries such as the Republic of Korea and the United States (footnote \n9). \n\nLeasing industry overview. Leasing provides a good solution for long-term wastewater \n6. \ntreatment  equipment  financing  as  banks  usually  do  not  recognize  movable  assets,  such  as \nequipment,  as  collateral.  The  PRC\u2019s  leasing  industry  has  been  growing  rapidly,  targeting  a \nfinancing  gap  that  traditional  bank  financing  does  not  address.  New  leasing  sales  in  the  PRC \nexpanded from $21.88 billion in 2008 to $265.68 billion in 2017, representing a compound annual \ngrowth  rate  of  31.97%.10 Despite  rapid  growth,  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  leasing  industry  still  needs \nfurther development. The lease penetration rate, measured as a percentage of lease finance to \ntotal  GDP,  was  2.21%  in  the  PRC  in  2017,  ranking  it  12th  among  50  countries  and  indicating \nample room for future growth. With total outstanding lease receivables of CNY6.55 trillion in 2018, \nthe leasing industry is also much smaller than the banking industry, which had total outstanding \nloans of CNY108.56 trillion in the same year. \n \nRationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations have been actively supporting leasing in the \n7. \nPRC given its underdevelopment and need for long-tenor financing, targeting a diverse range of \ndevelopment  subsectors.  ADB  has  provided  $475  million  in  debt  to four PRC  financial  leasing \ncompanies  (FLCs)  for  clean  bus  leasing  since  2013.11 ADB  has  also  provided  $75  million  for \nhealth care leasing and $60 million for SME lease finance.12 In 2018, ADB approved a loan of \n\n                                                 \n8  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  et  al.  2016.

ADB identified MWFL as a good partner to support wastewater treatment \nfinancing given MWFL\u2019s focus on the water sector and experience in financing WWTPs in Jiangsu \nand Zhejiang provinces, where many MSMEs have contributed to severe water pollution. MWFL \nhas  strong  shareholders,  sound  corporate  governance,  an  experienced  management  team, \nadvanced risk management systems, and good financial performance. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nMWFL  was  established  in  May  2015.  It  is  a  leasing  company  regulated  by  the  China \nBanking  and  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission  (CBIRC).

The PRC\u2019s leasing industry is still in the \nearly  stages  of  development.  Most  funding  is  available  to  companies  on  a  1-year  tenor  basis. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n18. \nEnhancing  MWFL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  capacity  and  supporting \ngender equity. ADB will be the first international finance institution to provide financing to MWFL. \nAs a condition for disbursement, MWFL must establish an ESMS that meets the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will continue to work with MWFL throughout the \nADB  investment  period to  enhance the company\u2019s  safeguard  capacity,  support  the  company\u2019s \nadherence  to  high  safeguard  standards,  and  promote  gender-inclusive  measures  in  its \noperations. MWFL will appoint a gender champion to empower and help create opportunities for \nMWFL\u2019s female staff, including professional and life skills training. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpacts. The project is expected to have the following development impacts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWater  pollution  reduced,  leading  to  a  more  sustainable  environment  and \nimproved water quality. By providing lease finance to WWTPs, the project helps \nincrease  wastewater  treatment  capacity  and  support  technological  upgrades  to \nmeet the stricter wastewater treatment standard imposed by the Government of \nthe PRC since 2015. This will lead to improvement of the urban environment and \nbetter quality of life for residents, including migrant workers; and \nFinancial  leasing  industry  developed.  Despite  rapid  growth  since  2008,  the \nPRC\u2019s  financial  leasing  industry  is  still  underdeveloped,  with  a  lower  leasing \npenetration  rate  than  other  developed  markets.  Access  to  finance  remains  a \nchallenge  for  most  leasing  companies,  particularly  for  long-tenor  loans,  and  the \nproject will help alleviate this funding bottleneck. \n\nOutcome. The outcome will be enhanced treatment capacity for industrial and municipal \n\n \n20. \nwastewater, which will benefit 2.2 million people in urban areas. \n \n\n4 \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n21. \n\nOutputs. The outputs will be the following: \n(i) \n\nMWFL\u2019s wastewater treatment lease operations expanded. MWFL will provide \nan  additional  $60  million  in  lease  finance  to  at  least  XX  industrial  or  municipal \nWWTPs; and \nMWFL\u2019s  gender  inclusiveness  improved.  The  project  will  also  strengthen \nMWFL\u2019s inclusiveness in its operations with respect to its women staff. \n\n(ii) \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \nB. \n \n22. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two \nStrategy  2030  operational  priorities:  (i)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (ii) making cities more livable.14 Under \nStrategy  2030,  ADB  will  increase  its  emphasis  on  assisting  developing  member  countries  in \nimproving their environmental management, including efforts to improve water quality and foster \ngreen  economic  growth.  The  project  also  contributes  to  water  security  and  environmental \nconservation, thus supporting the building of livable cities that are green, competitive, resilient, \nand  inclusive.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC, \n2016\u20132020  as  it  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  to  manage  environmental \nchallenges  to  reduce  water  pollution,  and  to  finance  private  sector  projects  with  innovative \ntechnologies and business models to support the development of green cities (footnote 1). \n \n23. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  fully \nsupports  ADB\u2019s  water  policy,  which  recognizes the  importance  of reversing  the  degradation  of \nwater resources caused by agricultural, industrial, and municipal effluents.15 The project is also \naligned with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which commits to investments of $2.0 \nbillion\u2013$2.5 billion per year by 2020 and targets an additional $500 million per year for private \nsector lending.16 In addition, the project supports the Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020, which \nidentifies  green  cities  as  a  priority  theme  of  ADB  operations. 17  Supporting  finance  sector \ndevelopment is a key focus of development assistance for ADB, and the project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nFinancial  Sector  Operational  Plan. 18  The  client  selection  and  project  design  reflects  ADB\u2019s \nexperience  in  the  PRC  leasing  industry  by  selecting  financial  intermediaries  that  have  proven \nexpertise in the targeted sector and augmenting the design by leveraging ADB-wide expertise of \nsector specialists and gender specialists in the early stages of structuring transactions. Lastly, the \nproject  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment  Operational  Plan, \n2013\u20132020.19 \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2018.

Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nADB has classified the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n24. \n(2009) as category FI for the environment and involuntary resettlement and category FI treated \nas C for Indigenous Peoples.20 \n \nCategory  FI.  ADB  has  assessed  the  investment\u2019s  potential  environmental  and  social \n25. \nimpacts, its risks associated with MWFL\u2019s existing and likely future WWTP lease finance portfolio, \nand  its  policies,  procedures,  commitment,  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement.  Due  diligence  found  that  while  the  installation  of  new  wastewater  treatment \nequipment is likely to have minimal or less adverse environmental impacts, WWTP operations \nmay  incur  impacts  from  effluent  discharge,  sludge  disposal,  odor,  and  noise,  as  well  as \noccupational health and safety risks. As the proposed project is for equipment leasing, the risk \nfrom  climate  change  impact  is  expected  to  be  low. Wastewater  treatment  can  support  climate \nchange adaptation by improving surface and ground water quality to enhance climate resilience, \nand  support  climate  change  mitigation  by  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emission  from  untreated \nwastewater. MWFL\u2019s lease finance to WWTPs are not expected to involve new land acquisition \nand/or  significant  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  as  the  company  only \nfinances WWTPs  that  have  completed  civil  works.  The  government  had  already  completed  all \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  WWTPs,  most  of  which  are  SOEs,  before  MWFL\u2019s \nfinancing.  MWFL  will  exclude  lease  projects  involving  construction  of  a  new  pipeline  from  the \nfinancing  of  the  ADB  loan.  No  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  in  areas  populated  by  ethnic \nminorities, and no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected from MWFL\u2019s existing and likely \nfuture WWTP lease finance portfolio.21 \n \n26. \nBased  on  due  diligence  findings,  ADB  has  identified  the  following  actions  to  be \nimplemented by MWFL: (i) adopt an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before first disbursement; (ii) apply \nADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list; (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and other social requirements, and abide by applicable \nnational  laws  and  regulations;  (iv)  screen  and  categorize  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement  potential  impacts  and  risks  and  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples;  (v)  exclude  from \nADB  financing  transactions  that  will  likely  have  significant  adverse  environmental  and  social \nimpacts (category A) and those involving construction of new pipelines; (vi) conduct environment \nand  social  due  diligence,  and  prepare  and  implement  corrective  action  plans  as  required  or \nexclude from ADB finance any subprojects with a compliance gap; (vii) appoint environment and \nsocial staff for day-to-day implementation of the ESMS; and (viii) develop staff capacity on the \nmanagement of environmental and social impacts and risks. The ESMS will set out requirements, \nas  applicable,  for  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy. \nThe  ESMS  will  also  contain  requirements  for  information  disclosure,  consultation  with \nstakeholders, and grievance redress mechanism, in accordance with ADB requirements. MWFL \nwill  include  in  its  regular  reporting  information  to  ADB  (i)  the  nature  of  subprojects  and \ncategorization, (ii) compliance with the safeguard and social requirements, and (iii) compliance \nwith applicable national and international laws and standards. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. MWFL will submit \n\n27. \nperiodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n28.  MWFL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nC. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \n29. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of  the \nPRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to MWFL.
