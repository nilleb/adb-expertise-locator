THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $450,000,000  (denominated  in  Indian  rupees  and/or  dollars),  without  government \nguarantee, to Coastal Gujarat Power Limited (CGPL) for the financing of the Mundra Ultra Mega \nPower Project. The proposed loan will have (i) a tranche of up to $250,000,000 funded by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and (ii) a tranche of up to $200,000,000 funded by ADB and \nsyndicated to the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) through a risk participation agreement. \nThe design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Project Background \n2.  The  Project  is  one  of  the  ultra  mega  power  projects  (UMPPs)  planned  by  the \nGovernment to ease India's current and pending electric power deficits. The Government has a \ntarget of \u201cPower for All\u201d by 2012. To meet the capacity addition targets required to achieve this \nobjective, the Ministry of Power launched an initiative facilitating the development of coal-based \nUMPPs. Development of large power projects can result in cheaper power through economies \nof scale. Recognizing this, the Government envisages a series of projects of at least 4,000 \nmegawatts (MW) each. These projects will be awarded to developers identified and selected \nthrough international competitive tariff-based bidding processes. The projects will be developed \non  a  build-own-operate  basis.  Based  on  supercritical  technology,  these  projects  are  also \nexpected to be more environment friendly than conventional subcritical generating units. India \nwill be dependent upon coal as a fuel for a large portion of its power generation for the \nforeseeable future as it has no other practical alternatives. Thus the issue is how to generate \npower from coal as cleanly as possible. The Project will be one of the new generation of cleaner \ncoal projects and thus merits ADB's active support. The Project will contribute significantly to \nreducing power shortages in the country. \n \n3.  To  enhance  investor  confidence  and  reduce  risk  perception,  the  Government  is \nundertaking some groundwork before the projects are handed over to the selected developers. \nTasks for the Government include water linkage; environment and forest clearance; allocation of \nenergy  sales  to  offtakers;  and  substantial  progress  in  land  acquisition,  rehabilitation,  and \nresettlement-related work. These tasks are to be undertaken by a shell, or special purpose \ncompany, formed specifically for each UMPP. Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) set up \nCGPL to be the special purpose company for the Project.  \n \n4.  The  Ministry  of  Power,  Central  Electricity  Authority,  and  PFC  are  working  on  the \ndevelopment of the UMPPs. PFC, as the nodal agency for project development, is responsible \nfor setting up the special purpose companies and developing them to a stage when they can be \ntransferred to the selected developers after the bid process. The Central Electricity Authority is \nto provide technical inputs on the various aspects of project conceptualization and development. \n \n5.  Bids for the selection of a developer for the Project opened on 18 December 2006. Six \nbids  were  received  and  the  Tata  Power  Company  Limited  (TPC)  was  short-listed.  On  28 \nDecember 2006, PFC issued a letter of intent in favor of TPC. \n \n6.  CGPL executed the power purchase agreement and other project-related agreements \non 22 April 2007. Subsequently, TPC purchased the entire shareholding of CGPL; CGPL is now \n ", "2   \na wholly owned subsidiary of TPC. CGPL will be responsible for the construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of the Project and for arranging the required debt finance. \n \n7.  Given (i) India's need for generating capacity to be added quickly (ii) public sector \nlimitations,  (iii)  the  conventional  memorandum-of-understanding  route  for  private  sector-led \nadditions to add to capacity, the Government asked ADB for advice on new methods for adding \nlarge blocks of capacity quickly and transparently. ADB suggested the Government follow the \nADB-developed Meghnaghat model successfully adopted by Bangladesh. This was accepted \nand  the  ultra  mega  power  program  was  developed  incorporating  the  Meghnaghat  model, \nadapted to Indian conditions. At each stage in the process, ADB was informally consulted; the \nGovernment asked ADB to explore every possible financing option to assist the Project. \n \nB.  Sector Background \n1.  Demand and Supply of Power \n8.  India continues to experience chronic electricity shortages, with peak demand exceeding \nsupply by 13.8% and the energy deficit at 9.6% in FY2007.1 Since FY1995, power demand has \ngrown rapidly as the economy expanded at an annual average of 6.8% in real terms.2 India is \nthe third largest electricity consumer in Asia, behind the People\u2019s Republic of China and Japan. \nPower quality remains poor, marked by high voltage fluctuations and recurring load shedding. \nIndustry  buys  approximately  35%  of  the  electricity  sold,  followed  by  households  at  25%, \nagriculture at 22%, and businesses and others at 17%.3 \n \n9.  As of 31 December 2006, India\u2019s installed power generation capacity was 127,753 \nmegawatts (MW) (Table 1). Capacity addition was targeted for 41,110 MW during the 10th Five-\nYear Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007); the actual capacity addition was 21,180 MW,4 i.e., some 52% of \nthe target. Energy shortfalls will persist over the short to medium term. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Installed Capacity as of 31 December 2006 \n(MW) \nThermal \nSector  Hydro  Nuclear  Renewable Total \nCoal  Lignite  Gas  Oil  Total \nCentral  6,672  24,020  2,490 5,899 0 32,409 3,900  0 42,981\nState  25,664  37,386  465 3,500 1,239 42,589 0  2,568 70,821\nPrivate  1,306  2,831  500 4,183 1,507 9,022 0  3,623 13,951\nTotal  33,642  64,237  3,455 13,582 2,746 84,020 3,900  6,191 127,753\nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of Power. 2007.

Plagued by poor metering, low \ncollections, high receivables, and high theft and losses, they have not been able to recover the \nlosses through tariff increases. As in most of ADB\u2019s developing member countries, tariffs in \nIndia are politically sensitive and held artificially low for political and social reasons. Many states \nprovide subsidized electricity to farmers and disadvantaged households; this results in tariffs \nthat are significantly below the cost of supply. Consequently, the weaker SEBs have exposed \npower generators to the problem of large accounts receivable. \n \n14.  During the early 1990s, the SEB-dominated power industry became a drain on the \nIndian economy and the Government recognized that changes were needed in the context of its \neconomic reform program. Initially the Government focused on increasing investment in power \ngeneration by opening up participation to private power providers and offering to fast-track \nprojects. However, it made little progress as only a handful of projects reached financial close, \nand the reforms did not address the SEBs\u2019 underlying fundamental weaknesses. \n \n15.  To address state and national difficulties, the Government initiated a reform program in \nthe mid-1990s based on recommendations of a high-profile government commission on power \nsector  reform.  The  program  included  (i)  reform  of  state  organizations,  including \ncommercialization and unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) regional and \nnational  reforms  to  strengthen  the  role  of  central  public  sector  utilities;  (iii)  large-scale \ninvolvement  of  the  private  sector  in  generation  and  distribution,  through  transparent  and \ncompetitive selection processes; (iv) creation of a central regulator to regulate bulk tariffs and \nstate regulators for small generation and end-user tariffs, thus depoliticizing electricity tariff \nsetting; and (v) a progressive phase-out of subsidies to agricultural consumers and increases in \ntariffs to more accurately reflect the cost of supply. While the suggested reforms emanated from \nthe central Government, states were given flexibility to choose their own reform path; this \nproduced  very  mixed  results.7  The  lack  of  competitive  standards  in  the  power  sector,  an \nemphasis on privatization for its own sake rather than for effecting improvements in quality of \nsupply  and  consumer  satisfaction,  the  seeking  of  higher  returns  on  investment  without \ncorresponding improvements in supply, and improper sequencing undermined the gains made \nin nonpolitical and transparent tariff setting and private sector participation in the sector. The \nwell-publicized reform failures in certain states stalled any progress or political will in the others.  \n \n16.  A much stronger central government role was required to accelerate the reform process. \nIn 1998, the Government enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, which led to the \nestablishment  of  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission,  an  independent  central \nregulator, and state equivalents (state electricity regulatory commissions). In 2003, the more \ncomprehensive Electricity Act was promulgated, which consolidated existing legislation for the \npower sector under a single act and includes provisions to improve competition and efficient use \nof resources. It includes initiatives to (i) promote unbundling of the power sector; (ii) delicense \nthermal power generation; (iii) liberalize the captive power policy; (iv) open access to distribution \nnetworks allowing direct sale of power to bulk consumers; (v) open access to transmission lines \nto facilitate power trading and improve performance of the transmission system; (vi) require \nmandatory metering and stringent provisions against power theft to remove the causes of the \nSEB problems; (vii) upgrade the central and state regulatory infrastructure; and (viii) improve \n                                                 \n7  The failures of the unbundling and privatization-driven efforts in Orissa were well publicized. However, the \nexperience in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which focused on restructuring through corporatization, was more \npositive. The reform efforts in the national capital region of Delhi provided some positive results by introducing \nprivate distribution licensees. ", " \n5\ncoordination between the central and state governments in planning and developing the power \nsector. The Government formulated a national tariff policy and national electricity policy in \nconsultation with the Central Electricity Authority, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, \nand the state governments. These recent legislative changes, new financial penalties to enforce \ngrid discipline by the SEBs, and the settlement of past dues curtailed the financial problems of \nthe SEBs, which had infected the sector as a whole.  \n \nC.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n17.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program (CSP) for India.8 The CSP draws on the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy: pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. The strategy \naims to support the Government\u2019s high-growth agenda by helping with fiscal consolidation, \ninfrastructure  development,  and  private  sector  development.  Political  and  economic \ndevelopments since finalizing the CSP indicate that the strategy remains valid, especially the \ncore  strategy  of  poverty  reduction  through  infrastructure-led  growth  supported  by  social \ndevelopment and good governance. The 2006\u20132008 CSP9 update suggests that the objective of \naccelerating  India\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth  to  8%  depends  on  upgrading \ninfrastructure facilities and improving the efficiency of such public services. ADB\u2019s proposed \nassistance program reflects this priority, with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% of the  \n3-year pipeline (not including private sector and nonsovereign operations). \n \n2.  Sector Strategies \n18.  The operating priorities of ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy10 are (i) reduce poverty by, \namong  others,  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii) promote \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors; (iii) address regional and global environmental impacts; and \n(iv)  promote  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB \ninterventions to increase private sector participation in the energy sector to take advantage of \nthe higher operating efficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet the large capital \nrequirements. The strategy promotes a shift to cleaner fuels and processes. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has \nsix main priorities: (i) reform the sector; (ii) promote higher efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources  that  are  locally  available;  (iii)  expand  and  optimize  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; (iv) support institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity \nAct  of  2003,  including  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading  systems;  \n(v) promote private sector participation; and (vi) encourage energy conservation, and ensure \nenvironmental and social sustainability. To support the Government\u2019s Power for All by 2012 \ninitiative, ADB\u2019s power sector strategy for create synergy with the 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

ADB successfully implemented a power sector reform program in the state of Gujarat; \nthe Gujarat power sector is one of the few state power sectors that recently recorded a surplus. \nThe Gujarat Power Sector Development Program11 facilitated restructuring of the power sector, \nreduced the need for transfers from the state government budget, allowed expansion of power \nsupplies using private generating capacity, and optimized the end use of electricity. The ADB \nassistance  comprised  a  program  loan  of  $150  million,  which  emphasized  the  creation  of \nstructures for good governance and regulation of the sector, especially the independence of the \nregulator  from  the  Government;  and  a  project  loan  of  $200  million,  which  supported  four \nsubprojects for transmission lines, substations, and distribution systems to improve evacuation \nof  power  from  independent  power  producers,  strengthen  the  power  distribution  system  to \nimprove  reliability  and  reduce  systems  losses,  and  conserve  electricity  and  water  through \nconversion of irrigation systems. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n21.  The Project is to construct, operate, and maintain a 4,000 MW coal-fired power plant \nwith five units of 800 MW each, incorporating supercritical technology near Tundawanda village, \nMundra  Taluka  in  Kutch  district,  in  the  state  of  Gujarat.  In  addition,  CGPL  is  to  make \narrangements to bring imported coal to the project site. This includes development of a jetty, \nunloading and handling of imported coal, and transport to the site. Infrastructure for processing \nseawater to meet in-plant water requirements, including intake and discharge to the sea, water \nintake pipeline, and a desalination plant, will need to be built. \n \nB.  Management and Ownership \n22.  CGPL, established under the Companies Act of 1956, is implementing the Project. \nCGPL's sponsor, TPC, owns 100% of CGPL shares. \n \n23.  CGPL's board of directors has four members: the TPC managing director, two TPC \nexecutive directors, and the managing director of the Tata Power Trading Company Limited. \nThe CGPL project director, under the supervision and control of the board of directors, handles \nday-to-day management of CGPL, supported by a team of senior management with energy and \nprivate sector backgrounds. \n \n24.  TPC is a part of the Tata Group,12 comprising 96 companies in seven business sectors: \nengineering,  materials,  energy,  chemicals,  services,  consumer  products,  and  information \nsystems and communications. TPC is promoted by Tata Sons Limited, which was established \nas a trading enterprise by the founder of the Tata Group, Jamsetji Tata, in 1868. Tata Sons \nLimited is the promoter of all key companies of the Tata Group, and holds the bulk of the shares \nin these companies. The chair of Tata Sons Limited traditionally has been the chair of the Tata \nGroup. Tata Sons Limited is the owner of the Tata brand name and the Tata trademark, which \nare registered in India and several other countries. Philanthropic trusts endowed by members of \nthe Tata family hold about 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons Limited. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n12 Tata Group is an informal name for the group of companies. ", " \n7\n \n25.  TPC, the largest private power utility in India, has an installed capacity of more than \n2,300 MW and the franchise for power distribution in Mumbai. Established in 1919, TPC took its \ncurrent form in 2000 through a merger with two other group companies: Tata Hydro-Electric \nPower Supply Company (established in 1910) and Andhra Valley Power Supply Company \n(established  in  1916).  TPC  has  supplied  power  to  the  southern  part  of  Mumbai,  India\u2019s \ncommercial hub and capital of Maharashtra state, for more than 80 years. TPC owns, operates, \nand maintains thermal power plants in several Indian states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, \nand Jharkhand. It also owns 18% of the country\u2019s private sector generating capacity. TPC has a \npresence in all areas of the power sector: thermal, hydroelectric, wind, solar, transmission, \ndistribution, and power trading. TPC has a track record in managing and executing power \nprojects in India and other countries such as Algeria, Iran, Kuwait, Liberia, Malaysia, Saudi \nArabia, and United Arab Emirates. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Construction \n26.  CGPL will construct the Project through various packages. A boiler package and a \nturbine generator package represent approximately 50% of the total project cost. The boiler \npackage will be procured from Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Company Limited \n(Doosan)  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  turbine  generator  package  from  Toshiba \nCorporation (Toshiba) of Japan. Doosan Projects Limited, an Indian incorporated company \nwholly  owned  by  Doosan,  is  expected  to  provide  onshore  supplies  and  services.  TCE \nConsulting Engineers Limited (TCE) from India will assist in preparing detailed specifications \nand  provide  engineering  and  design  support.  Korea  Power  Engineering  Company,  Inc.,  a \nsubsidiary of Korea Electric Power Company Limited, the largest power utility in the Republic of \nKorea, will review and reinforce TCE\u2019s work. \n \n27.  Doosan,  established  in  1962,  has  become  one  of  the  world's  major  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contractors; and is one of the few companies in the world with \nthe capability to design and manufacture supercritical boilers. Doosan\u2019s business structure is \norganized by business groups for power generation, desalination plants, nuclear power plants, \ncasting and forging, and construction. Its power generation business group is active in fields \nrelated to fossil fuel power generation, which includes boilers, heat recovery steam generators, \nturbine and generator equipment, and industrial support facilities such as material handling \nequipment  and environmental systems. Doosan has built more than 300 nuclear, thermal, \ncombined cycle, and hydropower plants. It is currently building more than 60 power plants in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Republic of Korea, United States, and others. Doosan \nrecently provided 660 MW supercritical boilers to National Thermal Power Corporation of India, \nand manufactured 800 MW supercritical boilers for Younghung Thermal Power Plant in the \nRepublic of Korea. \n \n28.  Toshiba started its business from a telegraph equipment factory in Tokyo in 1875, and is \nnow a leading manufacturer of heavy electrical apparatus with a worldwide sales and service \nnetwork. It has four major business areas: digital products, electric devises and components, \nsocial  infrastructure  systems,  and  home  appliances  and  others.  Toshiba  has  delivered \napproximately 1,700 steam turbine units, 240 hydraulic turbine units, 300 hydraulic generator \nunits, and 32 nuclear reactor units to customers throughout the world. It provides a vast range of \nturbine products, from several megawatt back-pressure turbines to over 1,000 MW supercritical \n ", "8   \nturbines. In February 1997, Toshiba reached the rare milestone of having produced turbine \nproducts with aggregate generating capacity of more than 100 gigawatts. \n \n29.  Project construction will be managed with particular attention to coordination among the \nvarious contractors. An advisory council, be formed by industry experts, will assist with CGPL \nmanagement, with support of Korea Power Engineering Company, Inc. The entire scope will \nhandled by three project managers: (i) common facilities and unit 1, (ii) units 2 and 3, and  \n(iii) units 4 and 5. Each project manager will cover engineering, procurement, and construction \nwith support from, and coordination among, TCE, TPC's engineering and planning division, and \nthe contractors. \n \n30.  The Project is expected to be completed unit by unit. Commissioning of the first unit is \nexpected by March 2011 and of the remaining units at regular 4-month intervals. The Project is \nexpected to achieve full commercial operation by July 2012. \n \n2.  Coal Supply \n31.  Up to 11.7 million tons (t) of coal will be required per annum. The Government designed \nthe  Project  with  imported  coal,  and  CGPL  will  source  coal  through  long-term  fuel  supply \nagreements with exporters of coal in Indonesia, South Africa, Mozambique, and/or Australia, \ntaking advantage of TPC's global coal procurement network. Despite the existing large domestic \ncoal reserve, availability of domestic coal is not able to keep pace with the growing demand for \ncoal for thermal generation. Under this circumstance, it is more economical to use imported coal \nfor power plants on coastal locations, especially for those far away from the domestic coal \nmines. The main domestic coal reserves are in the eastern region of the country, and coal \ntransport capacity is constrained. From the environmental perspective, the Government requires \nbeneficiation  before  transporting  high  ash  content  coal  over  long  distances.13  Hence,  the \nProject, being set up on a coastal location, has been designated to use imported coal. The \ndesign of boilers would be dependent on the type of coal, and once designed for imported coal it \nis difficult to switch to domestic coal which has high ash content and lower calorific value. In \nterms of the choice of imported coal, it is important to procure quality coal with higher calorific \nvalue, lower ash, and lower sulfur. Lower ash content improves the overall plant availability due \nto lower maintenance requirements. Also, with higher calorific value, the Project would require \nless quantity of coal to generate the same level of output. To achieve higher environmental \nstandards, procurement of imported coal with lower ash and sulfur contents is essential. \n \n3.  Coal Transport \n32.  CGPL will enter into a long-term time charter arrangement with bulk carriers for coal \ntransport utilizing TPC's global fuel procurement network and capacity. TPC plans to set up a \nsubsidiary to own vessels, and CGPL will enter into a time charter agreement with TPC's coal \nshipping subsidiary and/or directly with other shipping companies. \n \n4.  Port Services \n33.  Coal will be unloaded at Mundra Port. The concessionaire for the port, Mundra Port and \nSpecial Economic Zone Limited (MPSEZL), will provide port facilities as per the port service \nagreement between CGPL and MPSEZL. MPSEZL will make the terminal available and operate \nit to enable the minimum guaranteed tonnage to be unloaded and handled at the terminal. \n                                                 \n13\n Power plants located beyond 1,000 km from pit head cannot use coal containing more than 34% ash. ", " \n9\nMPSEZL will ensure storage of at least 0.6 million t in the coal stack yard if required by CGPL. It \nwill give berthing priority to CGPL's coal transport vessels, and make all arrangements for \nberthing of coal transport vessels. CGPL can also use the facilities at Mundra Port for unloading \nplant and equipment required for project construction. \n \n34.  Transport of the coal from Mundra Port to the project site will be through a dedicated \ncoal transport system. MPSEZL has agreed to provide the right-of-way for the corridor for the \nsystem, road access, and the seawater intake and discharge channel for the Project. \n \n5.  Power Offtake \n35.  Power generated by the Project will be sold to distribution licensees of the states of \nGujarat (excluding Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity Company), Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, \nand Rajasthan (Table 4). The seven offtakers that have signed power purchase agreements are \nGujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, \nPunjab State Electricity Board (PSEB), Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited, and the \nthree distribution companies from Rajasthan, Ajmer Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited, Jaipur Vidyut \nVitaran Nigam Limited, and Jodhpur Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited. \n \nTable 4: Allocation of Contracted Capacity for the Project \nContracted Capacity  Percentage \nState \n(MW)  (%) \nGujarat  1,805  47.5 \nMaharashtra  760  20.0 \nPunjab  475  12.5 \nHaryana  380  10.0 \nRajasthan  380  10.0 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited. \n \n36.  The performance of the state power subsector is determined by a number of factors, \nincluding (i) share of agricultural consumers in total electricity sales (as they receive subsidized \nelectricity), (ii) transmission and distribution losses, (iii) aggregate technical and commercial \n(ATC) losses in distribution, (iv) gap between average cost of supply and average revenue, and \n(v) collection efficiency. Table 5 provides a summary of recent changes in the composition of \nconsumers  and  transmission  and  distribution  losses  for  the  five  states.  In  most  states, \ntransmission  and  distribution  losses  have  declined  but  the  change  in  customer  profile  is \ninsignificant. The gap in the average cost of supply and revenues is greatest for agriculture; \ntherefore, the sales to this sector are an important determinant of required subsidy support. \n ", "10  \n \nTable 5: Electricity Consumer Profile and Transmission and Distribution Losses \n(%) \n  Gujarat    Maharashtra   Punjab    Haryana    Rajasthan \nConsumer  FY    FY    FY    FY    FY \nCategory  2004  2007    2004  2007    2004  2007    2004  2007    2004  2007 \nDomestic  13.2  15.5    24.0  23.2   22.9 22.5    20.2 20.5    21.3  21.7\nCommercial  4.8  5.9    9.5  9.7   7.4 7.4    5.1 5.6    9.3  8.6\nAgriculture  37.8  31.3    20.4  18.8   27.8 31.6    42.7 40.9    29.0  31.4\nIndustry  40.3  42.9    38.5  41.0   38.4 34.9    25.1 25.6    32.1  31.0\nOthers  3.9  4.4    7.5  7.2   3.5 3.6    7.0 7.3    8.4  7.3\n                             \nTransmission         \nand Distribution  24.5  28.4  34.1  30.4 26.4 24.6  34.7 31.5  44.6  38.5\nLosses \nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Central Electricity Authority. 2007. Report on Seventeenth Electric Power Survey of India. New Delhi. \n \n37.  Gujarat. The Gujarat Electricity Industry (Reorganization and Regulation) Act of 2003 \nrestructured the Gujarat Electricity Board into seven entities with functional responsibility for \ntrading,  generation,  transmission, and  distribution.  Gujarat  Urja  Vikas  Nigam  Limited  owns \n100% of the shares of the other six companies; and is responsible for bulk purchase and sale of \nelectricity,  supervision,  coordination,  and  facilitation  among  the  six  subsidiary  companies. \nDistribution licensees in Gujarat have a positive cash flow (including subsidy), and the deficit \nbetween average revenue and average cost is declining. However, the cross-subsidies have not \nchanged. The substantial improvement in financial performance is mainly due to near 100% \ncollection efficiency, reduced cost of supply because of operating efficiencies, and savings in \ninterest costs because of debt restructuring. \n \n38.  Maharashtra. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has been unbundled into four \ncompanies.  In  FY2006,  Maharashtra  State  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  had  a \nnegative cash flow (including subsidy) despite substantial profit in FY2004 and FY2005. The \ncross-subsidy has been steadily declining, indicating that a higher proportion of the cost of \nsupply is being recovered from consumers. Collection efficiency is good, with more than 100% \ncollection efficiency in FY2005, indicating that distribution licensees are recovering current dues \nand a portion of past dues. Generally, financial performance has improved. \n \n39.  Punjab. Punjab state continues to follow an integrated model whereby all three functions \nof generation, transmission, and distribution are handled by PSEB. PSEB has reduced ATC \nlosses considerably and achieved almost 100% cash collection. Its cash flow (including subsidy) \nhas improved significantly with substantial profit in FY2004 and FY2005. During the same \nperiod, PSEB achieved a surplus between average revenue (including subsidy) and average \ncost. Thus PSEB performance is characterized by cash profit, dependence on subsidy from the \nstate  government  because  of  the  mid-level  cross-subsidy,  high  collection  efficiency,  and \nrelatively low ATC losses. \n \n40.  Haryana.  The  Haryana  State  Electricity  Board  was  one  of  the  first  SEBs  to  be \nunbundled along functional lines into a generation company, a transmission company, and two \ndistribution companies. Subsequently, the trading function was separated from the transmission \nfunction. The generation company, Haryana Power Generation Company Limited, has been \nhandling the trading and bulk purchase functions in the state since June 2005. On 14 August ", " \n11\n1998, the transmission and distribution businesses were transferred to Haryana Vidyut Prasaran \nNigam Limited. The Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission regulates transmission and \ndistribution. Power is wheeled through the entire network by Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam \nLimited on the payment of transmission charges approved by the Haryana Electricity Regulatory \nCommission. Financial performance of the distribution licensees in Haryana are characterized \nby (i) not very sound cash flow positions, (ii) high dependence on subsidies, (iii) low collection \nefficiencies, and (iv) high ATC losses. Dependence on the state government subsidy is primarily \na result of Haryana having a largely agrarian economy with state-subsidized power provided to \nagricultural  consumers.  As  a  result,  the  negative  gap  between  average  revenue  (without \nsubsidy) and average cost of supply has steadily increased. \n \n41.  Rajasthan. The Rajasthan Power Sector Reforms Act of 1999 was enacted with effect \nfrom 1 June 2000, and accordingly the SEB was unbundled into five functional entities: one \ngeneration  company,  one  transmission  company,  and  three  distribution  companies:  Jaipur \nVidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, and Jodhpur Vidyut Vitran \nNigam Limited. These distribution companies operate and maintain the electricity system below \n66 kilovolts in their respective areas. As per the mandate of the 2003 Electricity Act, power \npurchase agreements (PPAs) and the procurement, bulk supply, and trading of power were \ntransferred to the three distribution companies in February 2004. Financial performance of the \ndistribution licensees in Rajasthan is characterized by negative cash flows, high dependence on \nsubsidies,  high  collection  efficiencies,  high  ATC  losses,  and  a  constant  cross-subsidy. \nDependence  on  the  state  government  subsidy  is  primarily  because  the  state  government \nprovides subsidies to various categories of consumers\u2014mainly domestic and agricultural. \n \n42.  The financial profile of the Project's offtakers is thus diverse (Table 6). However, none \nhave defaulted or delayed payment for power purchased, except for disputed amounts. \n \nTable 6: Characteristics of the Project's Offtakers \nItem  Gujarat  Maharashtra  Punjab  Haryana  Rajasthan \nOfftake from the Project  47.5%  20.0%  12.5%  10.0%  10.0% \nCash flow (with subsidy)  Positive  Negative  Positive  Negative  Negative \nCollection efficiency  Very High  High  High  Low  High \nNear 100%  93%  98%  85%  97% \nDependence on subsidy  Medium  Low  Medium  High  High \n(Subsidy booked/Total  12%  0%  17%  24%  20% \nincome) \nATC losses  Medium  Medium  Low  High  High \n30%  36%  26%  41%  46% \nATC = aggregate technical and commercial. \nSources: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited; Power Finance Corporation. 2007.

Tariffs will be payable on a \ntake-or-pay basis, in accordance with the tariff bid submitted by TPC.  \n \n44.  The tariff will comprise a capacity charge and an energy charge. The full capacity charge \nwill be paid based on the contracted capacity at normative availability of 85%. An incentive will \nbe provided for availability beyond 85%, but a penalty will be charged if availability is lower than \n85%. The capacity charge and energy charge will have components subject to escalation \nfactors. Application of the escalation factors are summarized in Table 7. \n ", "12  \n \nTable 7: Applicability of Escalation Factor \nItem    Adjustment for \nInflation  FOREX \nCapacity Charge     \n  Component with escalation  factor  Yes  No \n  Component with no escalation factor  No  No \n       \nEnergy Charge     \n  Component with escalation factor      \n    Fuel energy charge  Yes  Yes \n    Transportation energy charge  Yes  Yes \n    Fuel-handling energy charge  Yes  No \n  Component with no escalation factor     \n    Fuel energy charge  No  Yes \n    Transportation energy charge  No  Yes \n    Fuel-handling energy charge  No  No \nFOREX = foreign exchange fluctuation (Rs/$). \nSource: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited. \n \n45.  The payment by each offtaker will be supported by an unconditional, irrevocable, and \nrevolving letter of credit; and a default escrow account. If an offtaker defaults, CGPL has the \noption first to sell the power to the other offtakers and second to third parties. The liability of the \ndefaulting offtaker to make capacity charge payments to CGPL will remain unaffected for up to  \n3 years of capacity charges (to the extent not paid by another offtaker). If the total offtake is less \nthan  the  minimum  guaranteed  offtake  of  65%,  and  CGPL  has  paid  the  penalty  for  not \npurchasing the minimum quantity of fuel, CGPL is entitled to receive compensation for such \npenalty from the offtakers that didn\u2019t meet the guaranteed minimum offtake. \n \n \n46.  The  offtakers  are  responsible  for  procuring  the  transmission  facilities  beyond  the \nProject's  400  kilovolt  switchyard  bus  bar  under  the  PPA.  Power  from  the  Project  will  be \nevacuated by a dedicated transmission line to connect the Project with the grid system operated \nby Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n \n6.  Operation and Maintenance \n47.  CGPL\u2019s in-house engineers will be responsible for project operation and maintenance \nwith support from TPC. The key personnel of the operation and maintenance team will be \ndeputed from TPC and its affiliates, and have expertise in thermal power engineering. Other \noperations personnel, with strong expertise and experience, will be recruited from outside. \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n48.  ADB classifies the Project as environment category A, involuntary resettlement category \nB, and indigenous peoples category C. The assessment of the Project\u2019s environmental and \nsocial impacts was conducted through the following six separate but related studies: (i) rapid \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  conducted  by  TCE  from  March  to  May  2006,  \n(ii) comprehensive EIA conducted by TCE from March 2006 to August 2007, (iii) socioeconomic \nassessment report conducted by TCE from March to August 2006, (iv) rapid marine impact \nassessment conducted by the National Institute of Oceanography from January 2006 to April \n2007 and supplementary information provided in October 2007, (v) supplementary investigation ", " \n13\nof the cumulative impacts on ambient air quality of the Project and the neighboring 660 MW \npower plant prepared by TPC from late October to early November 2007 in consultation with \nVishudda Envirotech of India, and (vi) baseline social impact assessment conducted by Saline \nArea Vitalization Enterprise Limited of India in November 2007. \n \n49.  During the environmental and social assessment, the Government initiated a number of \nmeetings with the local community in 2005. A public hearing on the findings of the rapid EIA was \nheld on 19 September 2006. The hearing was conducted by the district collector in the presence \nof officials from Gujarat Pollution Control Board and CGPL, and representatives of affected \ncommunities. After CGPL was transferred to TPC in April 2007, further consultations were \nconducted in Bhuj and project-affected villages. These meetings were attended by affected \npeople  and  village  sarpanches  (village  council  heads),  public  representatives  in  district \npanchayat (village council), and local leaders. The Project received environmental clearance \nfrom the Ministry of Environment and Forests on 25 April 2007 based on the rapid EIA. All other \nclearances and permits required for various operations from the national and state authorities \nhave  been  obtained,  except  one  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests,  which  is \nexpected soon to reclassify the forestland in the site. \n \n50.  ADB reviewed the six studies related to environmental and social impacts of the Project \nand  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  mission  was  fielded  during \n29 October\u20131 November 2007. The summary EIA was circulated to the Board and posted on \nthe ADB website on 4 December 2007. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \npresented in Appendix 2. \n \n1.  Environment \n51.  The  EIA  prepared  for  the  Project  meets  the  requirements  of  ADB's  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). It describes the environmental baseline conditions in the project \narea, and records the results of a comprehensive examination of the potential impacts of the \nProject on the surrounding natural and socioeconomic environment. The project area is located \non marginal and barren land that is not ecologically or culturally sensitive. Important issues \nconsidered in the EIA include gaseous emissions and the discharge of a large volume of spent \ncooling water. The EIA confirms that (i) the emissions will meet national standards in India as \nwell as the World Bank\u2019s emission guidelines for new power plants, and (ii) the ambient air \nquality will not exceed these standards even if emissions from all planned future power plants in \nthe vicinity are considered. The EIA also confirms that the discharge of spent cooling water will \nnot  have  significant  impacts  on  the  marine  environment,  or  cause  coastal  erosion  and \ndeposition. Public stakeholder consultations were held and views expressed by the project-\naffected people are incorporated in the final EIA. \n \n52.  A core part of the EIA is an environmental management plan, including an environmental \nmonitoring and evaluation program covering both emissions and ambient environmental quality \nparameters. The plan is to effectively address potential environmental issues during project \nconstruction and operation. Appropriate clauses will be included in construction contracts to \nrequire contractors to implement the environmental management plan to minimize transient \nenvironmental disturbances. The contractors will also be required to provide appropriate training \nto their workers in environment, safety, and health aspects of construction; and to provide \nprotective measures for workers to minimize safety risks. \n \n53.  The Project will establish an organization to manage environmental, occupational health, \nand  safety  aspects  during  construction  and  commercial  operation  of  the  power  plant.  All \n ", "14  \npersonnel will receive training in occupational health and safety practices. Safety drills will be \ncarried out periodically. Safety manuals or handbooks will be prepared as required. \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n54.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Project originally required acquisition of 1,254 hectares \n(ha) of land, including approximately 241 ha for ash disposal, 182 ha for the colony, and 100 ha \nfor right-of-way for the coal transport system from Mundra Port. Project land is located within the \nvillage boundaries of Tunda and Mota Kandagara villages in Mundra Taluka (town) and Nana \nBhadiya  village  in  Mandavi  Taluka.  The  location  and  impacts  on  land  use  were  major \nconsiderations  for  selecting  the  site  in  Mundra  Taluka.  After  careful  review,  the  land  for \nacquisition was reduced to 1,052 ha and only a 202 ha right-of-way is required for the coal \ntransport system and inlet and discharge channels. Potential involuntary resettlement impacts \nwere minimized by selecting a site that is uninhabited, of low and unreliable productivity, and \nrequires minimal private land acquisition. The Project is categorized as B from the perspective \nof involuntary resettlement since the following impacts are expected: (i) loss of agricultural land \nowned by 76 families, (ii) loss of temporary structures (wells, cattle sheds), (iii) restricted access \nto produce such as fodder from forest and grazing land, (iv) loss of access to some of the public \nlands used for community activities (traditional mela [fair], cricket grounds) and (v) temporary \nloss  of  access  to  the  coastline.  CGPL  has  acquired  the  land  and  paid  compensation  at \nreplacement  rates  that  are  well  above  recorded  transactions.  Measures  to  mitigate  the \nsocioeconomic impacts arising from land acquisition and restricted access to common property \nresources  have  been  disclosed  to the  affected  people.  The  summary  resettlement  plan is \nattached as Appendix 3. \n \n55.  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  will  construct  the  transmission  lines  and \nMPSEZL will develop the coal-handling facilities in Mundra Port. Thus far, no land has been \nacquired for the transmission lines. When acquiring land Power Grid Corporation of India will \nfollow its corporate policy on resettlement, which ADB has accepted as consistent with ADB's \ninvoluntary resettlement policy requirements. The coal shipment and unloading facilities will be \nconstructed within Mundra Special Economic Zone; hence, no additional land acquisition is \nrequired. No issues with previous land acquisition for the economic zone are outstanding. \n \n56.  Indigenous Peoples. About 3% of the total population of 5,058 in two of three directly \naffected villages (Nana Bhadia and Kandagra Mota) belongs to scheduled tribes. No household \nor group belonging to scheduled tribes will lose housing, strip of land, or other fixed assets. The \neconomic activities of villagers belonging to scheduled tribes may be affected by acquisition of \nGovernment-owned wasteland and grazing lands, but alternative gauchar (grazing) land will be \nprovided. The scheduled tribes live together with the mainstream population, use the same \ncommon property resources, and engage in the same social activities; the Project will not affect \ntheir traditional practices. No impacts other than those identified in the short resettlement plan \nare expected; therefore, the Project is categorized as C from the perspective of ADB's Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nE.  Development Impact \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n57.  The Project aims to promote sustainable economic development in India by increasing \nthe supply of cleaner and low-cost electricity. The Project will build and operate the largest \npower plant based on state-of-the-art supercritical boiler technology. This will be one of the first ", " \n15\ninstances of the use of this technology in India. The Project will provide 4,000 MW of new \nelectricity capacity that will improve productivity and the quality of life in the five offtaking states. \nThe Project will help India increase the shift of its electricity supply to a cleaner generating \ntechnology  thereby  reducing  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and \nmonitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n \n58.  The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing the good practice standards for evaluating private sector investment operations, \nprepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of multilateral development banks. In terms of \nprivate sector development impact at the company level, the Project will expand the company's \ncapacity to build, operate, and manage very large projects. For the CGPL and beyond, the \npositive impacts of the Project include development of workforce skills, and introduction of a \nnew efficient technology, while demonstrating its viability for more widespread adoption. During \nthe 4.5 years of construction, CGPL will generate employment for more than 5,000 workers, and \nduring  operations  will  employ  720  workers  directly  and  create  livelihoods  for  many  others \nindirectly. The Project is expected to yield a private sector development impact well beyond \nCGPL. It is the first ultra mega power project and will help demonstrate the feasibility of joint \npublic\u2013private  development  of  such  projects.  The  Project  generates  efficient  and  low-cost \npower, setting a competitive benchmark for the industry. It also demonstrates the execution of \ninternational collaboration on commercial financing and technology transfer to the private sector. \nThe Project is financially sustainable; it meets local environment requirements, and mitigates \nthe emission of greenhouse gases thus yielding global environmental benefits. The Project\u2019s \ndevelopment effectiveness framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nF.  Economic Evaluation \n59.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The major economic benefit is the \nelectricity generated. Given the shortages in meeting energy and peak demand in the five \nofftaking states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan, all the electricity \ngenerated by the Project will meet unmet demand; it will not substitute power from any existing \ngeneration capacity. The entire project output is considered incremental. All offtaking states face \npeak and energy shortages that are projected to persist. A greater and more reliable supply of \npower is an important input for economic growth and development. Other project benefits \ninclude (i) adoption of more efficient power-generating technology that reduces coal burned and \nrelated  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases;  (ii)  generation  of  direct  and  indirect  employment \nopportunities; and (iii) induction of supercritical technology to India, as this will be one of the first \nsupercritical plants in the country. The incremental electricity produced is valued at the average \ncost paid by each state for power purchased. This is taken to reflect the willingness to pay for \nthe  incremental  supply  of  electricity  to  that  state.  The  Project  will  likely  generate  certified \nemission reductions; their value is incorporated as they represent the economic benefit of lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions and positive external effects on the global environment. \n \n60.  The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 33.2%. The \nsensitivity of the EIRR was tested under five adverse scenarios. Under all scenarios the EIRR is \nwell above the social discount rate of 12%. The EIRR is most sensitive to a decline in electricity \nsales but is still well above the social discount rate. The results of the economic analysis \nindicate that the Project is economically viable. \n ", "16  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n61.  The proposed ADB loan of up to $450,000,000 (denominated in Indian rupees and/or \ndollars) will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee, \nof which up to $200,000,000 is syndicated to KEXIM through a risk participation agreement, \nthereby reducing ADB\u2019s net exposure to CGPL up to $250,000,000.  \n \n62.  ADB will enter into a risk participation agreement with KEXIM, under which KEXIM will \nagree to pay to ADB any unpaid amount due by CGPL on an event of default under the \n$200 million tranche. ADB therefore has no credit exposure to CGPL for this tranche, but \ninstead  will  have  credit  exposure  to  KEXIM  with  respect  to  its  obligations  under  the  risk \nparticipation agreement. \n \nB.  Justification  \n63.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i)  The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s power sector strategy, and will \ncomplement ADB\u2019s efforts in assisting physical infrastructure development for \nsustainable economic growth in India. The Government is trying to fully meet \npower demand by 2012 and plans to increase the installed capacity significantly \nduring the 11th Five-Year Plan period. The Project will contribute significantly to \nthe reducing power shortages in the northern and the western regions of India. \n \n(ii)  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  India,  which  emphasizes \ninfrastructure  development  and  private  sector  participation.  In  particular,  the \nProject is built upon ADB assistance to the power sector reform program in the \nstate of Gujarat and dovetails with various efforts by the public sector operations \nfor India\u2019s power sector reform including dialogue with the Government. \n \n(iii)  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy,  with  priorities \nincluding  promotion  of  higher  efficiency  energy  sources.  Introduction  of \nsupercritical technology that improves thermal efficiency and reduces emissions \nis in line with the strategy. \n \n(iv)  The Project would be the first UMPP to be implemented, and its success will be a \nshowcase for large-scale power projects proposed for the country. In particular, \nUMPPs are being designed and implemented under public\u2013private partnership \nstructures, where the Government assumes key roles in developing the projects \nbefore they are transferred to private sector sponsors. The Project is expected to \nbe another successful model case for public\u2013private partnerships following on \nfrom ADB's work in Bangladesh. \n \n(v)  The proposed ADB loan supports installation of supercritical technology and \nhelps  improve  India\u2019s  environmental  standards  by  reducing  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. The use of supercritical technology helps achieve an overall higher \nconversion efficiency of 44% compared with prevailing efficiency of 34%\u201336%. \nThis translates into annual coal savings of about 2.6 million t. The Project is ", " \n17\nexpected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 28.3 million t of \ncarbon dioxide over its 10-year crediting period under the Clean Development \nMechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nThe Project could also benefit from ADB\u2019s carbon market initiative. \n \n(vi)  Consistent with ADB\u2019s mandate to mobilize financing from other sources, the \nproposed loan will catalyze financing from KEXIM through a risk participation \narrangement with ADB. The Project will be the first to be financed by KEXIM on a \nproject finance basis in the Indian power sector. KEXIM\u2019s principle reason for \nentering  into  the  proposed  risk  participation  structure  with  ADB  is  the  risk \nmitigation from ADB that this structure provides, and without the proposed risk \nparticipation arrangement with ADB, KEXIM may reconsider its participation in \nthe Project. The proposed structure is critical to catalyze KEXIM\u2019s competitive \nfinancing for the Project. \n \n(vii)  If relevant approvals for ADB's rupee financing can be obtained, ADB will provide \nthe proposed loan in rupees with a fixed interest rate, thereby mitigating the risk \nof currency mismatch between borrowings and revenue, in addition to mitigating \nthe risk of interest rate increases. This will improve the certainty of the Project's \ncash flow projections. Obtaining funding with these features from other sources \nwould  be  difficult  in  the  current  market.  In  addition,  a  risk  participation \narrangement  will  catalyze  the  risk-taking  capacity  of  another  financier  who \notherwise would not have the capacity to provide rupee financing to the Project. \n \n \nC.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n64.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  Combating  Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003) were explained to CGPL. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require \nCGPL to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing of terrorism; and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The \nfinancing documentation between ADB and CGPL will allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n65.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to ADB\u2019s proposed \nloan to the Project. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following \napproval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n66.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of up to $450,000,000 (to be denominated in Indian rupees and/or dollars) to \nCoastal Gujarat Power Limited for Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project, to be made available \n ", "18  \nthrough  (i)  a  tranche  of  up  to  $250,000,000  funded  by  ADB;  and  (ii)  a  tranche  of  up  to \n$200,000,000 funded by ADB and syndicated to the Export-Import Bank of Korea through a risk \nparticipation  agreement,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  on  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nsubsequently reported to the Board. \n \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n10 March 2008 \n ", "Appendix 1     19 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nAND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORK \n \nTable A1.1: Design and Monitoring Framework \n \nData \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting \nTargets/Indicator  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption: \n       \n\u2022 Promoting economic  \u2022 Peak shortages and  \u2022 National electricity  \u2022 Continued \ngrowth and  energy outages  statistics  macroeconomic and \ndevelopment and  reduced by 50% by    political stability \ncontributing to India\u2019s  2012 and 75% by  \u2022 National   \nPower for All by 2012  2017  macroeconomic data  \u2022 Continued \ngoal through the      implementation of \nenhanced supply of  \u2022 At least 5 ultra mega  \u2022 Reports by the central  power subsector \nefficient, reliable, and  power plants based  and states' power  reforms \nclean power   on supercritical  subsector regulators \n  technology in \noperation by 2015 \n \nOutcome       \n\u2022 Operating efficiency in  \u2022 Project achieves  \u2022 CGPL\u2019s operating  Assumption: \ncoal-based generation  gross efficiency of  reports   \nincreased  44% compared with    \u2022 Timely completion of \n  baseline of 34%\u201336%  \u2022 Financial records of  the transmission line \n  \u2022 Project demonstrates  the procurers  \u2022 Financial position of \n\u2022 Induction of clean coal  viability of    the offtakers remains \ntechnology in India  supercritical  \u2022 National and state  stable and improves \n  technology operating  electricity statistics  with implementation of \n  at over 90%    reforms \n  availability  \u2022 Registration of the  \u2022 Revenue from CDM \n  \u2022 Peak and energy  Project by the CDM  post-2012 depends on \n\u2022 Supply of  shortages reduced by  executive board  the agreement of a \ncompetitively priced  50% in five states by    post-Kyoto protocol \nelectricity leading to  2013    for climate change \ndevelopment of an  \u2022 Power requirements   \nefficient electricity  under the power   \nmarket  purchase agreements   \n  met   \n  Project generates   \n\u2022 Mitigation of  about 28 million tons   \ngreenhouse gas  of carbon dioxide   \nemissions  savings over 10 years   \n  of operation \nOutputs      Assumption: \n\u2022 Increased electricity  \u2022 Five units of 800 MW  \u2022 Project company's  \u2022 No delay in the \ngeneration capacity  each commissioned  operating reports  procurement and \n  and all units operating    supply of boilers and \n\u2022 Use of more efficient  by July 2012  turbines; engineering, \ncoal technologies  \u2022 First coal plant based  procurement, and \n  on supercritical  construction; and civil \ntechnology operating  works \nin India  \u2022 Finances are raised \n ", "20     Appendix 1 \nData \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting \nTargets/Indicator  Risks \nMechanisms \n  \u2022 Mitigation measures \nfor adverse \nenvironmental \nimpacts are in place \n \nRisk: \n\u2022 Project delay may \nresult without \nadequate construction \nmanagement given \nthat the Project has \nmultiple contracts \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.

Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nPower generated by the Project will be connected to the local grid, which will contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of providing \naffordable, universal electric service by 2012. Increasing power supplies to local grids will bring the benefits of electricity to \nremote communities, including better health care, sanitation, and education; greater income-earning opportunities; and higher \nliving standards. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nKey Issues. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting economic development of Gujarat and its \nneighboring states by providing critically needed power to support economic activities. The Project will generate employment \nand corporate income tax throughout the project life. Increased economical and efficient baseload generation capacity in the \nregion will enable the Government to achieve its stated policy of Power for All by 2012. A positive, direct impact on local labor \nis expected during implementation and an indirect impact will be due to the increased income-earning opportunities generated \nby increased access to electricity. \n \nDesign Features. The Project is establishing a 4,000 MW Ultra Mega Supercritical Thermal Power Project in Tunda Village, \nMundra Taluka, Kutch District, Gujarat State in western India. The project developer will implement livelihood and community \ndevelopment programs as part of their corporate social responsibility initiative. \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending: Not applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. Acquisition of public and private land for the Project will affect livelihood patterns of people living in villages close \nto the project site. In addition to permanent private land losses, access to produce like fodder and fuelwood from common \nproperty resources for economic and domestic use will be affected. Activities during the 4\u20135 years of construction will result in \nmovement of construction materials, equipment, and temporary in-migration of labor force, dust, and noise pollution; and may \ncontribute to pressure on water resources, sanitation, and solid waste management systems. The Project is expected to \ngenerate livelihood and employment opportunities during plant construction and operation. The project developer has adopted \nmeasures to address community concerns about compensation packages for land acquisition, replacement of grazing land, \nand apprehension about environmental pollution due to the Project, including redress of grievances. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Government initiated discussions with the local community in 2005; the project developer is continuing this process.

In December 2006, the Tata Power Company Limited (TPC), India\u2019s largest private \npower utility, won the bid to establish a 4,000 megawatt (MW) ultra mega power project (the \nProject). Coastal Gujarat Power Limited (CGPL) will set up the plant in Tunda Village, Mundra \nTaluka,1 Kutch District, Gujarat State in western India. The power generated will be allocated to \nthe states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Power Grid Corporation of \nIndia Limited will develop, operate, and maintain the electrical power flow transmission system, \nwhich will augment the existing transmission network in Gujarat and other states. The site is \nwell connected with state highways no. 50 (Anjar) and 6 (Gandhidham), the proposed national \nhighway 8A (Delhi\u2013Kandla), the railway station in Adipur, and Mundra Port. \n \n2.  This  resettlement  plan  to  mitigate  adverse  social  and  economic  impacts  from  land \nacquisition and/or restrictions on affected persons2 use of land, and to establish and maintain an \nongoing relationship with those affected throughout the life of the Project. \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n \n1.  Land Requirements for the Project \n \n3.  The Project originally planned to acquire 1,254 hectares (ha), including land for ash \ndisposal, residential complex, and the coal transport system. At present, the land acquisition \nrequirements are 1,052 ha (Table A5.1). Project lands are located within the village boundaries \nof Tunda and Mota Kandagara villages in Mundra Taluka, and Nana Bhadiya in Mandavi \nTaluka. Except for 181 ha of private land in Tunda, the Project will utilize Government land in \nTunda, Mota Kandagara, and Nana Bhadiya.  \n \n2.  Land Requirements for Associated Facilities \n \n4.  Transmission Lines. The net power produced by the power plant will be transmitted \nfrom the power plant\u2019s switchyard to Limbdi (300 kilometers [km]), Ranchodpur (390 km), and \nJetpur (330 km) substations. Power Grid Corporation of India will be responsible for acquiring \nownership rights; rights-of-way, easements; and continued access rights necessary for the \nconstruction, operation, maintenance, and upgrading of the new transmission facilities. Power \nGrid Corporation of India\u2019s environmental and social policy and procedures are consistent with \nthe Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n5.  Coal Shipment and Unloading Facilities. Existing facilities at Mundra Port can handle \nonly about 4 million tons per annum of coal. Therefore, Mundra Port and Special Economic \nZone Limited, the port owner, will construct a new berth and install mechanized coal-unloading \nfacilities  and  a  mechanized  coal-stacking  and  reclaiming  system  within  the  port\u2019s  special \neconomic zone to meet the coal import requirements of the Project and others.

Status of Land Acquisition \n \n6.  Private Land. CGPL and Power Finance Corporation initiated land acquisition in June \n2006 after finalization of the project site. Following their application, the district collector issued \nnotifications  under  section  43  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  (amended  in  1984)  on  \n20  September  2007  and  for  section  64  on  13  April  2007.  Notices  were  placed  in  the \nmamlatdar's5 office at Bhuj, and village panchayat6 offices. After section 6 notification, CGPL, \nnow  owned  by  TPC,  began  the  process of  acquiring land  through  consent  negotiation  by \noffering compensation at rates higher than prevailing market rates and other incentives or \nbenefits  to  those  affected.  CGPL  organized  small  and  large  public  meetings  at  Bhuj  (five \nmeetings)  and  project-affected  villages  (three  meetings).  The  meetings  were  attended  by \nsarpanches (village council heads), those affected, public representatives in district panchayats \nand local leaders. As a result of these meetings, compensation was fixed at Rs1.5 million per ha \nfor private landowners. This rate is higher than land acquisition rate fixed by the Government \nRs250,000 per ha.7 Compensation payments to all 76 private landowners are expected to be \ncompleted by the end of March 2008. \n \n7.  Government Wasteland and Gauchar Land. The project site requires acquisition of \nGovernment wasteland and gauchar (grazing) land. Land transfer orders for wasteland and \ngrazing land were issued by the Kutch district collector in April and May 2007, respectively. Prior \nto the Project, part of Tunda village wasteland was allocated to the Mundra Special Economic \n                                                 \n3\n Under  section  4  of  Land  Acquisition  Act,  notification  was  issued  on  20  September  2006  (Ref.  No. \nAM/2006/190/M/LKU/162006/ 1551/GH) and public notices were issued in local vernacular daily Chanchal and \nEnglish daily Indian Express on 2 October 2006. \n4\n The public notices for section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act were issued in Chanchal and Indian Express on 13 April \n2007. \n5\n A mamlatdar, who has delegated powers of a magistrate, is responsible for maintaining land records and issuing \nsuch certifications as domicile, caste, and income. \n6\n Local village government bodies. \n7\n Calculated based on data from the last 5 years of land transactions in the area. \n ", "26     Appendix 3      \nZone. Following CGPL's application, the Government decided to transfer the allotment for zone \nto CGPL in November 2007.  \n \n8.  Forestland. The Project requires reserve forestland at Mota Kandagra, Mundra Taluka. \nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests approved the request on 29 March 2007 with the \ncondition that CGPL establish 130 ha of compensatory forest at Bamnka, Bhachau Taluka, \nKutch district. \n \n4.  Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n \n9.  The Project will entail loss of private land, temporary structures, and other assets; and \naffect common property resources and access of the fishing community to fish-drying areas on \nthe coastline. \n \n10.  Loss of Private Land. Private land (181 ha) to be acquired comprises 95 land plots \nowned by 76 families. Although listed in the village panchayat records as agricultural, this land \nis predominantly saline and of low and unreliable productivity with some grazing potential.  \n \n11.  Among the private landowners are 30 households classified as belonging to vulnerable \ngroups.8 Nine households are identified as scheduled castes, while 21 are women landowners. \nNo one losing land or livelihoods from privately owned land belongs to any scheduled tribes. \n \n12.  Loss of Structures and Other Assets. A few temporary structures (cattle sheds and \nthatched sheds) and other assets (wells) will require compensation. \n \n13.  Loss of Common Property Resources. The acquisition of public land will have partial \neconomic impacts on Tunda, Mota Kandagra, and Nana Bhadiya villages. Approximately 4% of \ntotal available grazing land, 50% of total available wasteland, and 40% of total available private \nagricultural land in village Tunda and subvillage Tunda Wandh are required. In Motakandagra, \n45% of the total available wasteland and all forestland (open scrub vegetation) are required, \nwhile in Nana Bhadia, 33% of the total available wasteland in the village is required. Cattle \nrearing  and  milking  is  an  important  source  of  livelihood  in  the  affected  villages  in  which \n330 households have 4,340 livestock. In Tunda Wandh, about 150 rabaris (shepherds) will be \naffected by acquisition of grazing land. Approximately 80 charcoal makers utilize wood from the \nthorn scrub plant species in the area. \n \n14.  Impact on Fishing Communities. Although the fishing potential of the Gulf of Kutch is \nsignificant, no local fishing activities occur in the coastal waters directly fronting the project area, \nwhich has vast intertidal mudflats. The nearest small fishing community is at the Kotdi creek \nbank located outside the project area about 2.8 km from the Mudhwa creek. The discharge of \nspent cooling water will not affect the fishing activities in the gulf. The provision of a culvert over \nthe intake channel will ensure continued access of the fishing community to fish-drying areas on \nthe coastline. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8\n Affected  persons  considered  socially  \u201cvulnerable\u201d  comprise  households  headed  by  women,  those  who  are \nphysically challenged, and those who belong to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. ", "Appendix 3      27 \nB.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n1.  Compensation and Resettlement and Rehabilitation Principles \n \n15.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on the Land Acquisition \nAct of 1894 (amended in 1984), National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy (NRRP, 2007); \nand ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Based on those, the following involuntary \nresettlement principles are applicable: \n \n(i)  Avoid negative impacts of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement on people \naffected by the Project to the extent possible. \n(ii)  Where  negative  impacts  cannot  be  avoided,  assist  those  affected,  particularly \nvulnerable groups, in improving or at least regaining their standard of living and \nincome. \n(iii)  Disclose  all  information  related  to,  and  ensure  affected peoples  participation  in, \nrehabilitation planning and implementation. \n(iv)  Provide compensation for acquired assets at replacement value in accordance with \nthe rehabilitation policy and entitlement framework. \n(v)  Provide rehabilitation assistance and income restoration to those affected including \nnontitled residents. \n(vi)  For those persons without land titles such as squatters and encroachers, CGPL has \ndeclared the date of the census as the cutoff date for eligibility and entitlement. \n(vii)  Provide for affected people not present during enumeration. Anyone moving into the \nproject area after the cutoff date will not be entitled to assistance. \n(viii)  Provide compensation for land prior to taking possession of the acquired lands and \nproperty. \n(ix)  Establish  village  and  district  grievance  redress  mechanisms  to  ensure  speedy \nresolution of disputes. \n(x)  Ensure  involvement  of  women  and  vulnerable  groups  in  all  activities  related  to \nrehabilitation planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n(xi)  Ensure adequate budgetary support to cover implementation costs for resettlement \nplans.  \n(xii)  Conduct internal and external monitoring of implementation of resettlement plans.  \n \n2.  Entitlement Matrix \n \n16.  In accordance with these principles, those affected will be entitled to a combination of \ncompensation packages and resettlement assistance depending on (i) the nature of ownership \nrights on lost assets; (ii) scope of the impacts including socioeconomic vulnerability of those \naffected;  and  (iii)  the  measures  to  support  livelihood  restoration,  if  livelihood  impacts  are \nenvisaged.  Social  mitigation  arrangements  will  be  set  up  to  support  livelihood  restoration \nmeasures. Project-affected people will be entitled to the following five types of compensation \nand  assistance  packages:  (i)  compensation  for  the  loss  of  land,  crops  and/or  trees  at \nreplacement cost; (ii) compensation for structures and other immovable assets at replacement \ncost; (iii) assistance in lieu of loss of income; (iv) rebuilding and/or restoration of community \nresources and facilities; and (v) assistance to restore and improve sources of income and \nlivelihoods.

If acquisition of land through the consent mechanism fails, other provisions of the relevant act \nmay  be  invoked,  i.e.,  it  would  follow  the  conventional  process  of  land  acquisition  adopted  by  the  district \nadministration as per the Land Acquisition Act. \nSource: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited. \n ", "Appendix 3      31 \nC.  Public Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress Mechanisms \n \n1.  Public Consultations and Disclosure \n \n17.  The Government initiated discussions with the local community in 2005 before CGPL \nwas transferred to the successful bidder, the Tata Power Company Limited, in April 2007. The \nfirst formal consultation took place in September 2006 as a public hearing on the findings of the \nenvironmental impact assessment of the Project. The public hearing was conducted by the \ndistrict collector in the presence of officials from Gujarat Pollution Control Board, CGPL, and \nrepresentatives  of  affected  communities.  The  major  concerns  related  to  the  location, \ncompensation package land, availability of gauchar land, and apprehension on environmental \npollution due to the Project. \n \n18.  After transfer of CGPL to TPC in April 2007 about eight (small group and large public) \nmeetings were organized both at Bhuj (five meetings) and in project-affected villages (three \nmeetings). These meetings were attended by affected people and village sarpanches, public \nrepresentatives in district panchayat, and local leaders. At that stage, key issues raised related \nto the compensation package for land and alternative land for cattle grazing. \n \n19.  Information  on  affected  assets,  compensation  rate  and  payments,  and  mitigation \nmeasures have been disclosed through notices and public communications to affected persons \nfrom April to November 2007, which has given them sufficient time to raise objections and for \nCGPL  to  propose  alternative  mitigation  measures.  The  short  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndisclosed on the ADB website and a summary made available to affected persons in the local \nlanguage at the tehsil and the district magistrates\u2019 offices. CGPL has dedicated resources to \nensure that the consultative process will continue during construction and operation of the \npower plant. CGPL is committed to ensuring that affected households and the local community \nbenefit substantively from opportunities offered by the Project. \n \n2.  Grievance Redress Mechanisms \n \n20.  An effective district grievance redress mechanism will be set up to deal with grievances \nof  the  project-affected  people  relating  to  land  acquisition  and  rehabilitation.  Effective \nparticipation of the affected communities will be ensured in the process. The grievance redress \nmechanism will be a two-tier system comprising a field cell, and a senior cell. The field cell will \naddress  grievances  pertaining  to  eligibility  and  entitlement  filed  by  affected  individuals  or \nfamilies. It will comprise the community relations officer, assisted by the village coordinator and \nthe village workers of the concerned village. The senior cell will be chaired by the district \nadministration\u2019s representative, normally the block development officer and other cell members, \nand include two representatives of the affected community and the head of community relation \nteam of CGPL. It will review cases escalated by the field cell for consideration. The claimants \nwhose cases were rejected by the field cell can apply to the senior cell for review.  \n \n21.  Issues requiring legal advice will be handled by the panchayat and district administration \nor, if required, in a court of law that will be distinct from CGPL\u2019s responsibilities. \n \nD.  Income Restoration and Rehabilitation \n \n22.  The involuntary resettlement impacts of the Project can be mitigated and opportunities \ngenerated maximized by taking up appropriate mitigation measures in consultation with local \n ", "32     Appendix 3      \nresidents. CGPL will implement the following mitigation measures to mitigate the impacts on \naccount of private and public land acquisition. \n \n23.  Restoration of Income for Loss of Agriculture Land. Aside from payment of full \ncompensation for acquired land at negotiated rates, vulnerable affected people who have lost all \ntheir  land  or  are  left  with  unviable  parcels  of  land  will  be  assisted  in  utilizing  their  cash \ncompensation to buy alternate land in a nearby area, given land availability. Compensation for \nthe standing crop for the land acquired by the Project, will be paid at market value. \n \n24.  Provision of Alternative Grazing Land. CGPL is working with the Gujarat government \nand affected communities to develop and implement solutions to ensure that livelihoods of \ncattle-grazing  communities  in  the  project-affected  villages  are  not  adversely  affected. \nCompensation paid for gauchar land includes an 30% to ensure the gauchar land can be \npurchased to restore the area required to support the animal population in the village. Villagers \ncan continue grazing on the project land until construction activities begin. Alternate grazing \nland and forestland will be made available to the villagers by the Gujarat government. \n \n25.  Provision of Employment and Livelihood Opportunities. The Project will employ \n5,000\u20136,000 people during construction and 720 during operations. During construction, CGPL \nwill provide suitable employment opportunities to appropriately skilled affected people. During \nproject operation, the suitable local community will be employed to the extent possible. Special \nefforts  will  be  made  to  train  local  residents  to  achieve  skills  for  better  employability  and \nentrepreneurship development in the area. CGPL will also encourage entrepreneurship among \nthe community by awarding service contracts to qualified local candidates for such activities as \ncanteens,  vehicle  hiring,  maintenance  of  gardens,  office  services  and  cleanliness,  courier \nservices, and material supplies. \n \n26.  Restoration of Other Common Property Resources. The traditional mela (fair) in the \narea occurs annually. An approach road will be built that will ensure continued access to the \nmela in addition to the current approach road. The approach road is expected to be completed \nwithin 6 months. CGPL is coordinating with local officials to provide open space for village youth \nwho use public land as a cricket playground and identify alternate sites for the crematorium to \nbe used by scheduled castes.  \n \n27.  Access to the coastline will be ensured by providing a culvert over the intake channel \nconnecting  to  Kotdi  creek.  The  culvert  will  be  completed  before  any  interruption  by  the \nconstruction of the intake channel. \n \nE.  Rehabilitation Budget \n \n28.  Based  on  the  detailed  measurement  survey  and  census,  the  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation budget will be worked out. Besides the cost for land, other allowances for different \ncategories will be ascertained. In addition, affected people will be entitled to a resettlement and \nrehabilitation assistance according to the NRRP 2007. Contingency provisions will be made to \ntake into account variations from this estimate. The budget will be indicative of outlays for the \ndifferent expenditure categories. These costs will be updated and adjusted to the inflation rate \nas the Project continues and given more specific information such as increased number of \naffected people during implementation; unit costs will be updated as necessary. \n \n29.  Costs  for  Budget  Components.  The  budgetary  allocation  for  the  rehabilitation \ncomponent of the Project was based on the anticipated impacts, entitlement options as defined ", "Appendix 3      33 \nin the entitlement matrix, and requirements to be fulfilled as per the directives under the NRRP \n2007 and guidelines prescribed by the International Finance Corporation and ADB. The budget \ncovering resettlement and rehabilitation activities is approximately Rs100 million. \n \n30.  The resettlement and rehabilitation budget, excluding land compensation cost, is for \nRs1.5 million per ha of private land for 181 ha. Monetary assistance for structures and other \nassets; expenditures for livelihood restoration program and training; budgetary allocation for \nfacilitating market linkages and entrepreneurial development; and land development for fodder \nproduction, water conservation, and silvipastoral practices are part of the allocation. \n \n31.  To ensure functioning of the resettlement and rehabilitation cell through the project life \ncycle and facilitate project preparation and implementation, the Project will cover administrative \ncosts of the resettlement and rehabilitation cell, payments for necessary consultancy services, \nproject implementation support services, and postimplementation evaluation by independent \nagency. This is part of the budgetary allocation. \n \n32.  In line with its corporate social responsibility initiative, requirements under NRRP 2007, \nand guidelines prescribed by the International Finance Corporation and ADB, peripheral area \ndevelopment in the district is part of the budgetary allocation. \n \n33.  Compensation  for  Acquisition  of  Private  Properties.  The  compensation  for  the \npermanent acquisition of private agricultural land has been agreed at Rs1.5 million per ha. The \nagreement is based on negotiations between affected persons and CGPL. \n \n34.  Compensation for Structures and Other Nonland Assets. A consolidated allocation \nwill be made for temporary structures (sheds) and other assets (wells). \n \n35.  Livelihood Restoration Budget. A detailed livelihood restoration component will be \nestimated  for  the  Project.  The  livelihood  restoration  component  will  include  funding  for \nemployment opportunities, and monetary and nonmonetary allowances. The components will \ninclude (i) training for agricultural laborers on non-land-based activities, (ii) training and material \nprocurement support and market linkages for artisans, (iii) alternate livelihood options and \ntraining for charcoal manufacturers, (iv) vocational training for employable persons in Industrial \nTraining Institute and other technical institutions, (v) implementation of women-led self-help \ngroup activities and cooperative activities (cottage industries, handicrafts, microcredit activities, \npickle and papad [lentil chips] making, etc.) and (vi) development of grazing and pasture lands. \n \n36.  Allowance to Vulnerable Affected Persons. A pension plan for affected people and \nfamilies identified under the vulnerable category will be allocated. It will include (i) pension to the \nvulnerable  category;  (ii)  facilitation  of  income  restoration  activity  in  the  project  villages;  \n(iii) community development programs in the project area; (iv) infrastructure augmentation in the \nproject  villages  (water  supply,  sewerage,  sanitation,  roads  and  solid  waste  management);  \n(v) development of common property resources and community assets in the villages. \n \n37.  Approach  Road  Construction.  Allocation  will  be  made  for  construction  of  a  new \napproach road to the mela ground. \n \n38.  Supporting Cost for Implementation of the Resettlement Plan. Allocation will be \nmade for administrative cost for the institutional setup within CGPL for finalizing the resettlement \nplan, implementing resettlement and rehabilitation, logistics, preparation of other compliance \ndocuments for submission to funding institutions and implementation support agencies. \n ", "34     Appendix 3      \n \n39.  Contingency. Fifteen percent of the budget will be kept as contingency to absorb any \nvariation in the budget during implementation. \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangements and Implementation Schedule \n \n40.  Since April 2007, CGPL has set up a project office at Bhuj, which acts as a link between \npeople from the project-affected villages and the company. At present, two senior staff and \nother support staff are engaged in addressing issues related to land acquisition. The officials \ninteract on a regular basis with the villagers and attempt to address their concerns. In order to \nstrengthen the process, CGPL will establish a formal project management office with expertise \nin  engineering  planning  and  design,  financial  management,  procurement  and  contracts \nmanagement, and environmental and social impacts management. The project management \noffice will have a full-time corporate social responsibility and resettlement and rehabilitation \nofficer  who  will  be  responsible  for  ongoing  community  engagement,  and  finalization  and \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n41.  The implementation schedule is presented in Table A5.3. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n42.
