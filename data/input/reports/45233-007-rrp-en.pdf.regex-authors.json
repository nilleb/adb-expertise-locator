THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan and a proposed grant, both to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Integrated \nSocial Protection Development Program. The report also describes the proposed administration \nof a grant to be provided by the Education Above All Foundation (EAA) for the Integrated Social \nProtection Development Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the EAA \ngrant. \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  is  part  of  the  Benazir  Income  Support  Programme  (BISP), \nPakistan\u2019s  flagship  social  protection  program  and  federal  level  implementing  agency.  The \nprogram aims to strengthen and expand the social protection system to alleviate the poverty of \npoor women and their families through three outputs: (i) institutional capacity for social protection \nand climate resilience strengthened; (ii) access to primary and secondary education improved for \nchildren and adolescents of poor families; and (iii) access to health services and nutrition supplies \nenhanced for women, adolescent girls, and children of poor families.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Strategic Context  \n3.  Overview. Pakistan, the world\u2019s fifth-most populous nation,2 is a lower-middle-income \ncountry with gross national income per capita of $1,280 in 2020.3 The poverty rate fell from 50.4% \nin 2006 to 24.3% (about 48 million people) in 2015. Another 19.9% (about 20 million people) are \nnear-poor and vulnerable to shocks that could pull them below the poverty line.4 The country\u2019s \nmultidimensional poverty headcount ratio is estimated at 39.0%, with the greatest contribution to \npoverty stemming from educational deprivation (42.8%), living standards (31.5%), and health care \n(25.7%). The rural poverty head count ratio of 30.7% is more than double the urban ratio of 12.5% \n(footnote 4). With a large informal economy, public health shocks such as the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic can push the country\u2019s poor and near-poor deeper into poverty. Women, \nwho dominate the informal labor market, and girls from poor families are disproportionately \naffected in times of economic crises. As of 1 October 2021, more than 1.2 million cases of COVID-\n19, with 27,729 deaths, had been confirmed and reported to the World Health Organization \n(WHO). As of 27 September 2021, as part of the government\u2019s COVID-19 preparedness and \nresponse plan, 78.4 million vaccine doses had been administered.5     \n \n4.  Macroeconomic context. The economy declined by 0.5% in fiscal year (FY) 2020, the \nfirst negative since FY1952, under the impact of COVID-19. However, the economy is projected \nto grow at 1.5% in FY2021, and a broad and balanced economic recovery is projected in FY2022 \nand beyond, which bodes well for the sustainability of financing national priorities. The fiscal deficit \nand public debt are assessed as sustainable by recent International Monetary Fund reports.6 The \nfiscal deficit (7.1% of gross domestic product [GDP] in FY2021) is forecast at 5.5% in FY2022 \n \n1  The transaction technical assistance was approved in 2020.

Similarly, general government debt (including guarantees) after \nrising slightly to 92.9% of GDP in FY2021 is forecast clearly downward to 82.1% in FY2023.  \n \n5.  Human development. The government\u2019s spending is low: 2.9% of GDP on education and \n1.1% on health.7 The human capital index was 0.41 in 2020 (0.40 for females), which means that \nthe future productivity of a child born today would be less than half the productivity of a future \nworker relative to the benchmark of complete education and full health.8 About 19 million children \naged 5\u201316 years are out-of-school9 and only about 51% of the population (42% of females) have \ncompleted primary education. Pakistan is one of nine countries where child mortality rates are \ndecreasing  at  a  lower-than-expected  rate.10 Highlighting  the  inequity,  the  rates  of  under-5 \nmortality are higher in the lowest wealth sections of the population (100 per 1,000 live births) than \nin the highest (56 per 1,000 live births) and in rural areas (83 per 1,000 live births) than in urban \n(56 per 1,000 live births).11 Child undernutrition levels are above the WHO cutoff values for public \nhealth significance, with a \u201cvery high\u201d prevalence of stunting (40.2%) and wasting (17.7%).12   \n \n6.  Education. The major issues are the (i) high proportions of children that are out-of-school, \n(ii) high gender disparities, and (iii) inadequate quality of learning. Girls have far less access than \nboys to education at each level. Net enrollment rates drop sharply from primary education (62% \nfor girls and 73% for boys) to secondary education (34% for girls and 40% for boys).13 Of all 5\u2013\n16-year-old children, 30% were out-of-school in FY2019 (36% female and 25% male)14 and 32% \nin FY2020 (22% in urban and 37% in rural areas, including 26% who had never been to school \nand 6% who had dropped out) (footnote 9). In rural areas, only 23% of females from the poorest \nsections  of  the  population  had  ever  attended school,  compared  with 64%  of those  in the \nwealthiest. In 2018, the difference between primary gross and net enrollment rates was 29 \npercentage points for boys and 25 for girls, indicating overaged children (more for boys) were \nrepeaters. Learning outcomes remain to be improved and on tests, boys outperform girls by 2\u20133 \npercentage points in urban areas and by 7\u20138 percentage points in rural areas.15 \n \n7.  Health and nutrition. The coverage and use of maternal health services are inadequate: \none-third of women give birth without skilled health attendants and 30% of deliveries take place \nat home (footnote 11). Immunization coverage was only 66% in 2018, insufficient to stop measles \nand polio outbreaks.16 Infant and young child feeding practices are suboptimal: less than half of \ninfants are exclusively breastfed, while in-time introduction of complementary feeding requires \nsignificant improvement (footnote 12). Micronutrient deficiencies are high: in 2017, for children \nunder 5 years, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 62.7%, vitamin A 51.5%, and zinc \n18.6%, while 53.7% were anemic. More than half of adolescent girls (56.6%) and 41.7% of women \nof reproductive age are anemic (footnote 12).

Pakistan is prone to various climate change impacts and disasters \nincluding floods, heat waves, and droughts, which are expected to have wide-ranging impacts, \nreducing agricultural productivity and water availability, and increasing the frequency of extreme \nclimatic  events.  Such  covariate  shocks  have  a  disproportionate  impact  on  the  poor,  and \ninterventions are needed that strengthen the resilience of the poor and vulnerable. These \nchallenges are further compounded by the lack of institutional and beneficiary capacity to support \nclimate and disaster resilience of poor and vulnerable populations. Institutional structures in place \nfor social protection and potential entry points for integration of climate risk information into BISP\u2019s \ntargeting mechanism must be assessed.18  \n \n9.  Benazir Income Support Programme. The BISP was established in 2008 and confirmed \nin 2010 as an autonomous organization to (i) increase the financial capacity of the poor, (ii) \nformulate and implement policies and programs to uplift the underprivileged and vulnerable, and \n(iii)  reduce  poverty  and  promote  the  equitable  distribution  of  wealth.  BISP  implements  an \nunconditional cash transfer (UCT) program (Kafaalat), providing the poorest women and their \nfamilies with basic income support, and a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program called Taleemi \nWazaif to incentivize school enrollment of children from UCT beneficiary families. Originally \nfocused on primary education, the CCT for education is now expanding nationwide to secondary \neducation. Since 2020, BISP has started a pilot CCT for health and nutrition (CCT-HN) program \n(Ehsaas Nashonuma), which aims to improve access to health and nutrition services for pregnant \nand lactating women of UCT beneficiary families and their children under 2 years old. BISP\u2019s \ninitial beneficiaries were identified through a nationwide poverty scorecard survey in 2011 using \na proxy-means test approach. The efficiency and effectiveness of BISP were tested when it \nserved as the platform for responding to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \non poor households. Using a hybrid targeting approach, BISP expanded its coverage for the new \npoor and provided emergency cash transfers of PRs.12,000 to more than 14.8 million households.   \n \n10.  Institutional challenges. Although much progress has been made in strengthening \nBISP\u2019s institutional capabilities, more needs to be done to ensure that BISP has the robust system \nand capacity to expand its programs effectively and sustainably, including the following:  \n(i)  Grievance redressal mechanism. Beneficiaries have poor knowledge about the \ngrievance redressal mechanism and tend not to submit complaints. The resolution \nof  complaints  is  often  neither  timely  nor  transparent,  which  has  led  to  low \nconfidence in the process. Appeals and grievances relate mostly to targeting \n(eligibility), payments, and CCT-specific concerns. \n(ii)  Financial  management.  With  external  technical  assistance,  BISP  converted \naccounts from cash to accrual basis and completed, although with delay, the first \naudit of accrual-based financial statements for FY2019. The challenge now is to \nconduct timely these activities with in-house resources to avoid the risks to internal \ncontrols such as irregular payments to partner banks that were not engaged \nthrough competitive process.19 \n(iii)  Procurement. The procurement system assessment identified several risks and \ncapacity limitations. These include the understaffing of the Procurement Wing (or \nDivision), high turnover of staff and personnel, delays in procurement planning, \nweak contract management, substantial use of direct contracting, and absence of \nan online complaint handling system.  \n \n18 ADB 2017. Climate Change Profile of Pakistan. Manila. \n19 Department for International Development. 2018. Assessment of Error, Fraud and Corruption Controls in Pakistan \nBISP Cash Transfer Programmes. Islamabad. Unpublished. \n \n ", "4 \n(iv)  Monitoring and evaluation. BISP uses various monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nmechanisms for its different delivery systems, programs, and processes. Most of \nthe operational wings have their own M&E units that operate independently from \nthe M&E Wing. Such segregation is reflected in BISP\u2019s management information \nsystem (MIS). The system design requires alignment to business needs and \nautomation. Separate systems for UCTs and CCTs lead to a heavier administrative \nburden and duplication of data management. \n(v)  Climate change. BISP lacks adaptiveness and only takes ex ante measures to \ndeal with climate shocks. Climate change information is not integrated into the MIS \nand National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER). \n \n11.  Impact evaluation. As per the impact evaluation findings from 2011 to 2019, BISP \nbeneficiaries have experienced substantial welfare gains attributable to the schemes. The gains \ninclude increased per-adult equivalent consumption expenditure (by 22% in real terms) and \ngreater female agency and women\u2019s empowerment (such as greater mobility of women and their \nautonomy in decision-making, and increased opportunities for personal savings). BISP\u2019s CCT-\neducation stipend component continues to have a strong positive impact on school enrollment \nand reduction in grade repetition rates for girls. BISP beneficiaries are 8\u201314 percentage points \nmore likely to be enrolled in school than non-beneficiary poor children. Yet, significant barriers to \neducation remain, such as opportunity costs, and parents who disapprove of girls\u2019 education and \nprohibit girls from attending school, especially at puberty.20 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n12.  Government strategy. In April 2019, the Prime Minister launched the Ehsaas strategy, \nfor the \u201cextreme poor, orphans, widows, the homeless, the disabled, those who risk medical \nimpoverishment, for the jobless, for poor farmers, for laborers, for the sick and undernourished; \nfor students from low-income backgrounds and for poor women and elderly citizens.\u201d The strategy \nsupports four pillars: (i) tackling elite capture and making the government system work for \nequality, (ii) providing safety nets, (iii) developing human capital, and (iv) promoting jobs and \nlivelihoods. The government established the Poverty Alleviation Council under the leadership of \nthe Prime Minister and the BISP chairperson and brought vital institutions such as BISP and the \nPakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund under the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division. BISP \nis  the  main  implementing  agency  of  Ehsaas,  supporting  pillar  2  (cash  transfers,  poverty \ngraduation programs, and a targeted safety net) and pillar 3 (CCT-education stipend and CCT-\nHN). BISP\u2019s CCT-HN fulfills objective 1 of the Pakistan Multi-sectoral Nutrition Strategy 2018\u2013\n2025 by \u201clinking social protection to nutrition intervention.\u201d21   \n \n13.  Alignment with ADB strategic priorities. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nsupported BISP since 2014 through the Social Protection Development Project,22 additional \nfinancing,23 and  emergency  assistance  for  BISP\u2019s  immediate  response  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic.24 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s (i) Strategy 2030 (operational priorities 1, 2, 3, \n \n20  Oxford Policy Management. 2020.

Lessons. ADB has applied lessons learned from its intervention in the social protection \nspace and, more specifically, its experience with BISP since 2014 (footnotes 22\u201324): (i) BISP \nmust be institutionally strengthened to enable it to expand UCTs and CCTs sustainably, efficiently, \nand effectively; (ii) scientific findings on young child growth and development and the importance \nof adolescent girls\u2019 nutrition need to keep informing program design; (iii) formal schools face \nchallenges to enroll overaged children; (iv) coordination and cooperation with the provincial \ngovernments must be improved to ensure adequate supply capacity and quality services; (v) the \npoor  population\u2019s  needs  must  be  identified  and  updated  periodically  to  accommodate \ndemographic and economic changes and avoid inclusion or exclusion errors; and (vi) BISP must \nclosely coordinate with key development partners such as the World Bank, for example, which is \nupdating the beneficiary targeting system. \n \n15.  Results-based  lending  modality.  The  results-based  lending  (RBL)  modality  is \nappropriate because (i) a clearly defined government strategy, Ehsaas, and program, BISP (para. \n12), have a specified scope for support from ADB and other development partners; (ii) the \nmodality offers the required flexibility and results focus to incentivize institutional strengthening of \nBISP, notably leveraging the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) and the program action plan \n(PAP) to accomplish and sustain critical changes in fiduciary functions that lie at the core of BISP\u2019s \noperations (for example, financial management and procurement); (iii) BISP has a proven record \nof results-based management: it implemented a World Bank-financed program-for-results and its \ninstitutional learnings and productivity gains have informed program scope and design; 26 (iv) \ncentered on results to be achieved, RBL incentivizes interventions and pilots as the basis for \nfuture scale-up by BISP, such as overaged children\u2019s integration in formal education, adolescent \ngirls\u2019 nutrition, improved behavior change and communication (BCC), and women\u2019s financial \nliteracy; and (v) given the impact evaluations (para. 11), scaling up CCT for human capital \ndevelopment will need the RBL modality to ease strategic and operational interventions in \nresponse to increasing poverty, for example, expanding CCT-HN to all 159 districts or introducing \nnew climate resilience and disaster response programs.  \n \nC.

Program Results \n17.  Impact alignment and outcome. The RBL program\u2019s impact will be poverty alleviated \nand the status of excluded and deprived families, especially women, elevated.27 The outcome will \nbe the social protection system strengthened and expanded.28 At the outcome level, DLIs and two \nother indicators are used to track achievement of results. DLI 1 measures the total effective \ncoverage of the CCT-HN program (through continuous payments received by CCT-enrolled \nwomen and children, reflecting their access to and continued use of health and nutrition services). \nDLI  2  measures  total  effective  coverage  of  the  CCT-education  stipend  program  through \ncontinuous payments received by CCT-enrolled girls and boys, reflecting their access to and \nretention at school. DLI 3 supports the establishment and implementation of a newly consolidated \ngrievance management system for women beneficiaries. The other two indicators, not linked to \ndisbursement, track the immunization coverage of infants as a proxy indicator for the health \nbenefits conferred by the CCT program, and the completion of primary and secondary education \nby CCT beneficiary children to reflect certain learning results. \n \n27 Government of Pakistan, Prime Minister\u2019s Office. 2019.

Output  1:  Institutional  capacity  for  social  protection  and  climate  resilience \nstrengthened. The output will help support BISP deal with weaknesses related to core fiduciary \nfunctions such as financial management, procurement, M&E and MIS, and grievance redress \nmanagement. DLI 4 aims to strengthen financial management, including the settlement of internal \naudit as well as external audit observations. DLI 5 will help BISP strengthen its procurement \ncapabilities through adequate qualified staffing; updating and enhancement of the procurement \nmanual and customized bid documents; preparation and timely publication of a consolidated \nprocurement plan, including its updates; establishment of a fully functional online complaint \nhandling system; and reduction of the number of noncompliance findings identified by annual \nthird-party fiduciary review during program implementation. DLI 6 will support establishing an \nintegrated MIS to expedite business process automation of all BISP programs, as well as start \nbuilding the capacity of BISP to plan and monitor the impact of climate change on the poor to \nupgrade risk responsiveness. The latter will commence with an initial analysis of climate and \ndisaster risk information and identify entry points for climate change aspects at policy and \ninstitutional level.29 This could provide the basis for a new cash transfer program to respond to a \ndisaster. Finally, a non-DLI will track the start and rollout of financial literacy programs to ease \naccess for women and reduce extortion of illiterate women by third-party agents.  \n \n19.  Output 2: Access to primary and secondary education improved for children and \nadolescents  of  poor  families.  The  output  will  help  BISP  expand  CCT  for  education  for \nbeneficiaries\u2019 access to, retention in, and graduation from primary (grades 1\u20135) and secondary \neducation (grades 6\u201310). The emphasis will be on expanding enrollment of children (DLI 7), \nincluding out-of-school children (OOSC), in formal schooling (DLI 8). BISP will initiate a pilot for \noveraged  OOSC  attending  selected  accelerated  learning  programs  in  schools  run  by  the \neducation  departments.  BISP  will  implement  community  social  mobilization  and  enrollment \ncampaigns among UCT households through compliance monitors as well as other personnel to \nboost demand and educate parents on the need to keep their children, especially girls, in schools. \nBISP and relevant education departments will agree to coordinate the CCT implementation \nthrough qualified schools, harmonizing data needs, and meeting the additional demand that the \nCCT for education will generate. Updated NSER data will be shared with provincial governments \nto improve collaboration efficiency with their secondary education stipend programs. Training will \nbe rolled out for teachers and principals on enrolling and monitoring of and reporting on CCT \nbeneficiaries, and on dealing with OOSC to prevent them from dropping out and to promote their \ncompliance with BISP conditionalities. Studies and reviews will be carried out to better implement \nsecondary education CCT under supply-side constraints, and to roll out coverage of accelerated \nlearning programs for overaged OOSC. \n \n20.  Output 3: Access to health services and nutrition supplies enhanced for women, \nadolescent girls, and children of poor families. The CCT-HN will focus on 22 target districts in \ntwo  provinces  under  agreed  criteria  mainly  related  to  stunting  prevalence  and  supply-side \nreadiness.30 The output will strengthen BISP\u2019s capacity to implement a balanced intervention \npackage, emphasizing gender and BCC, which are deemed to have substantial impact on \nmaternal and child nutrition. Agreements between BISP and the relevant health departments will \nensure the necessary supply-side support for the CCT. Demand for the CCT-HN will be brought \nup through social mobilization by lady health workers and other community-based workers. DLI 9 \n \n29 Further details in the Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n30 The criteria include (i) the stunting prevalence in respective districts, (ii) the presence of on-going or planned health \nsystem development and/or nutrition support projects in districts, (iii) the level of climate change and disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards risk in districts, and (iv) other topographic and geographic factors influencing access to \nservices. The 22 districts will be different from the 14 districts of the ongoing pilot CCT-HN and the 20 districts \ncovered by the World Bank\u2013financed program (Table 1). \n \n ", "8 \nis  included  for  enrollment  in  the  CCT-HN  program  and  its  rollout,  accompanied  by  BCC \ncampaigns, for which gender-sensitive behavior change indicators will be monitored. The output \nsupports BISP in designing and piloting nutrition schemes in 2 selected districts (out of the 22) for \nadolescent  schoolgirls  (10\u201319  years  old)  with  iron-folic  acid  supplementation.  It  will  be \nimplemented through coordination by BISP with relevant departments of health and education by \ntargeting CCT-education stipend beneficiary girls to ensure feasibility and simplify operations. \nStudies will be done to map qualified health facilities and to assess the potential rollout of the \nadolescent schoolgirls\u2019 nutrition scheme. \n \n21.

Development and verification of indicators. The DLI targets and results chain were \ndeveloped in a consultative process with BISP, based on (i) BISP\u2019s past performance, (ii) BISP\u2019s \nnational targets, and (iii) the added value of the RBL program\u2019s support. The process ensured \nthat the DLIs and other performance indicators would provide ambitious yet achievable measures \nof progress toward outputs and outcome, and that outputs would be sufficient to achieve the \noutcome. All DLIs will be verified by the independent verification agency (IVA) (para. 30).   \n \nE.  Value Added by ADB \n23.  ADB value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition through the RBL modality will extend beyond \nfinancing for (i) supporting knowledge by identifying regional and international good practice \nthrough ADB\u2019s social development, gender, climate change, and governance thematic groups (for \nexample, on the design and implementation of UCT and CCT); (ii) promoting innovation by \nintegrating the  BISP  MIS;  (iii)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in financial  management, \nprocurement, governance, and MIS through DLIs 3\u20136, to support the expansion of UCT and CCT; \n(iv) improving CCT design to allow resolving identified issues in education, health, and nutrition \nthrough DLIs 7\u20139; (v) reinforcing BISP\u2019s financial and economic sustainability through governance \n \n ", "9 \nand financial management actions in the PAP; (vi) initiating interventions and pilot programs as \nthe basis for future scale-up in areas of significant potential to make a difference for the poorest \nwomen and girls, such as overaged children\u2019s integration into formal education, adolescent girls\u2019 \nnutrition, better BCC, women\u2019s financial literacy, and climate change resilience; and (vii) forming \nsynergies with other development partner\u2019s support for BISP (Table 1), and complementing the \nsupply-side interventions in education and health with demand-side mobilization. \n \nF.  Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan  \n24.  Program expenditures. The RBL program expenditures are estimated to be $6,527 \nmillion from FY2022 to FY2026 (Table 3). They include capital expenditures and recurrent \nexpenditures under BISP\u2019s various social protection schemes and institutional activities. The UCT \nprogram accounts for three-quarters of the total, followed by the education CCT at 16%. The \nremaining budget heads account for 1%\u20132% each. The annual allocations vary from 10.5% in \nFY2022 (6 months) to a total of 42.0% in FY2025 and FY2026 (6 months). \n \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework, FY2022\u2013FY2026 \n(2021 prices) \nItem  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \n1.

Program financing. The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $600,000,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $3,000,000 from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), to help finance the program. The loan will \nhave a 30-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. Based on the custom-tailored repayment method, the average maturity is 18.98 \nyears, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. The EAA will provide grant \ncofinancing not exceeding $24,480,000, to be administered by ADB. The summary program \nfinancing plan is in Table 4, with known or expected funding sources. \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nGovernment of Pakistan  5,699.52  90.08 \n \nAsian Development Bank   \n   Ordinary capital resources (regular loan)  600.00  9.48 \n   Special Funds resources (ADF-13 grant)  3.00     0.05 \nEducation Above All Foundation (grant)a  24.48  0.39 \nTotal  6,327.00  100.00 \nADF-13 = Asian Development Fund 13 Thematic Pool, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator. \na Administered by the Asian Development Bank, with $24 million for DLI and $480,000 for the 2% administration fee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  The largest funding source, about 90%, is the government\u2019s counterpart funding of $5,699 \nmillion, while ADB\u2019s and EAA\u2019s funding make up $627.48 million, or 10%, of total program funding. \n \n ", "10 \nThe size of the counterpart funding reflects the government\u2019s focus on and prioritization of social \nprotection spending. A grant not exceeding $3.0 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF-\n13 Thematic Pool) will finance inclusion of climate resilience measures. From the EAA grant, $24 \nmillion will finance output 2b and DLI 8 related to OOSC enrollment in primary education and \n$480,000 will finance ADB\u2019s 2% administration fee. Given the cofinancing from EAA, universal \nprocurement applies to the RBL program.31 Financing for prior results at $40 million and advance \nfinancing at $60 million against subsequent achievement of DLIs will be provided in line with \nprogram and financial requirements. The allocation of $200 million for primary education CCT by \nthe World Bank as part of its financed program-for-results (Table 1), although outside ADB\u2019s \ncoordination, helps balance program expenditure.  \n \n27.  Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $31.5 million, of which ADB will finance 100% \n(climate mitigation activities are not quantified). The estimate was shown in the climate change \nassessment, using a conservative method as required by ADB guidance on climate finance.32 \nThe ADF-13 grant is instrumental to support initial assessments and capacity building and, \ntogether with climate resilience activities under the DLIs, will enable BISP to integrate climate \nchange and disaster risk information into the targeting and delivery systems of ongoing and future \ncash transfer programs. These assessments will inform the social mobilization and behavioral \nchange strategy to include climate change awareness raising for BISP beneficiaries. \n \nG.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n28.  The PAP will meet the need to strengthen BISP\u2019s capacity to achieve program results \nsustainably. The PAP includes actions in specific technical areas, M&E, fiduciary management, \ngender, and safeguards to complement the program\u2019s investments.33  \n \n29.  A transaction technical assistance for $750,000 financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund to support the preparation and follow-up implementation of \nthe RBL program, including financial management, among others, was approved in December \n2020 (footnote 1). Supplementary financing of $1.0 million for it is planned to support a range of \nactivities, including (i) a strategy on social mobilization and behavior change, (ii) advisory support \nto  implement  BISP\u2019s  procurement  plan  for  FY2021\u2013FY2023,  (iii)  midterm  evaluation  of \nimplementation  of  secondary  education  CCT  in  53  districts  least  advanced  in  secondary \neducation,  (iv)  a  study  on  CCT  students\u2019  performance  (transition  and  completion),  (v) \ndevelopment of a financial formula to define and update the amount of CCT for education, and \n(vi) design of a pilot scheme to provide folic acid supplements for adolescent schoolgirls. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n   \n30.  The program will be implemented from 2022 to 2025.34 BISP will be the executing and \nimplementing agency. A program management team nominated by BISP will monitor and report \non progress through quarterly reviews conducted jointly with ADB and other development partners \nas appropriate. The team will be led by an assigned BISP program director and supported by a \nfull-time hired program coordinator on program implementation and reporting at routine basis. A \nprogram supervisory committee chaired by the BISP secretary will lead the quarterly review \n \n31 ADB. 2013.

A  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  BISP  chairperson  is  coordinating  with  the \nprovincial governments, development partners, and other stakeholders on strategic decision-\nmaking and harmonization. Given that the development partners, including ADB, are providing \nsupply-side support for education and health (detailed in footnote 17), such arrangement will allow \nthe program to benefit from shaping synergies between demand- and supply-side interventions. \nBISP will sign memorandums of understanding with the provincial governments to expand and \ncoordinate CCT implementation. An IVA will be engaged to verify program results in line with the \nverification protocol (Appendix 3).35 A memorandum of understanding, satisfactory to ADB, will \nbe signed between BISP and the IVA on the detailed arrangements and schedule to be followed \nby the IVA before the prior results of DLIs are submitted for verification. The data from MIS, which \ninvolves spot checks to enhance data accuracy, will be used for the IVA\u2019s verification process, \nsupplemented with studies or surveys to be supported by consulting services (such as for DLI 5). \n \n31.  Disbursement  arrangements.  The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed on between the borrower and ADB. BISP will submit a withdrawal \napplication reporting on the achievement of DLIs and compliance with other requirements, and \ndisbursement will be made subject to verification by the IVA according to the verification protocols \n(Appendix 3, Table A3.3). If a DLI target has not been fully achieved but partial disbursement has \nbeen agreed on, the partial disbursement ratios are specified in the DLI matrix and verification \nprotocol. Disbursements will be made as specified in the verification protocols for early or late \nachievement. Disbursement of advance financing will be immediate upon effectiveness, and \ndisbursement of financing for prior results will be subject to the verification of achievement of prior \nresults. BISP will refund any advance financing amount outstanding if any DLI is not achieved. \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed to the government\u2019s general bank account. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n32.  Results assessment. The RBL program design and implementation arrangements are \ndeemed sound. The results framework and DLIs are assessed as robust and adequate for \naddressing the various barriers to institutional performance and social protection coverage. As \nBISP is the government\u2019s flagship social protection program, receiving $1.5 billion annually, the \nRBL program is expected to improve overall sector performance and outcome.  \n \n33.  Program soundness. The program has strong public policy justification. Alternative ways \nof undertaking the planned program activities, for example, through direct involvement of the \nprivate sector, are not relevant given the existing policy principles (obligation of the state to \nsupport needy individuals through welfare programs) and the institutional set-up (the role and \nresponsibilities of BISP as established by law). The program design is expected to achieve \nefficiency gains in its various interventions. Notably, the RBL program will help strengthen BISP\u2019s \ninstitutional and fiduciary systems and lead to efficiency gains, which will enable sustainable \nexpansion of the UCT and CCT programs. The RBL program will strengthen BISP\u2019s accountability \nto poor women; contribute to welfare and consumption gains; boost women\u2019s empowerment; \nincrease school attendance; reduce grade repetition, especially among girls; and reduce the \nnumber of OOSC. The RBL program\u2019s results for beneficiaries (for example, increased enrollment \n \n35 The Planning Commission (PC) was identified as an IVA by the government and development partners including the \nWorld Bank (Table 1) and ADB. The government\u2019s Rules of Business (1973) as amended up to April 23, 2019 affirms \nthe role for the PC in results-based monitoring of government programs. The PC is financially and functionally \nindependent from the BISP and has demonstrated capacity in serving as an IVA (footnote 26). \n \n ", "12 \nand school attendance) are likely to be sustainable since the program design is based not only \non increasing demand through the cash transfers, but also raising awareness and changing \nbehavior among communities.   \n \n34.  Economic analysis. The improvement in BISP\u2019s institutional capacity (output 1) can be \ninstrumental in improving targeting of beneficiaries and the overall poverty profile which can lead \nto efficiency gains in overall resource utilization and management. The enhancement of human \ncapital resulting from increased access to basic services of education and health care, with \ngender-sensitive targeting and measures (outputs 2 and 3), will help increase productivity of \nindividuals and families and chances of exiting poverty traps. International evidence suggests that \nCCTs  to  poor  families  have  significant  positive  impact  on  poverty  reduction  and  human \ndevelopment  outcomes.  BISP\u2019s  UCTs  have  documented  poverty  gap reduction  of  up  to  3 \npercentage points nationally (footnote 20), in addition to the positive impact of education CCTs \non primary school enrolment rates of beneficiaries (para. 11). \n \n35.  Poverty, social, and gender. The program is categorized as gender equity. The RBL \nprogram reduces poverty among poor women and their families through its cash transfers, which \nimpact evaluations (para. 11) have shown to increase consumption and increase welfare gains \nsuch as the ability to personally save. Empowerment of women and girls is a basic tenet of the \nentire RBL program design, as seen in six key aspects: (i) despite prevailing patriarchal societal \nnorms, all cash disbursements are made only to women, leading to gains in female agency and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment; (ii) Output 2 recognizes plans for and directly targets the gender gap in \neducation through increased cash incentives for girls (DLIs 7 and 8), the quarterly payment to \ngirls at all levels of education is markedly higher than for boys, at the primary level, the quarterly \npayment made to each girl (PRs2,000) is 33.3% higher than for each boy (PRs1,500), while at \nthe secondary level, the quarterly cash incentives are PRs3,000 for girls and PRs2,500 for boys; \n(iii) by setting ambitious and equal quantitative targets for girls (the same as for boys\u2014DLIs 2, 7, \nand 8), BISP aims to narrow the gender gap, since the 2020 baseline is only 88 girls enrolled for \nevery 100 boys enrolled in the primary education CCT program; (iv) all measures in the program \nto benefit OOSC will have a proportionally greater benefit for girls than for boys, since for every \n100 out-of-school boys, there are 144 out-of-school girls; (v) Output 3 explicitly targets adolescent \ngirls\u2019 nutrition, which will lead to gains in well-being and female empowerment beyond reducing \niron-deficiency anemia, such as development learning and work performance; and (vi) under \nOutput 1, the indicator for women\u2019s financial literacy, with a corresponding PAP action, directly \ntargets a key barrier that reduces access and benefits for women, and makes them more \nsusceptible to exploitation by third-party agents.  \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n36.  Monitoring and evaluation system. BISP uses various M&E mechanisms for its different \ndelivery systems, programs, and processes. The M&E activities are largely led by the operational \nwings; the role of the M&E Wing is minimized (para. 10). Overall, while the M&E Wing is \nconstrained by staffing capacity, the operational wings (the NSER, CCT-education stipend and \nCCT-HN) were assessed as fully able to monitor and report on the DLIs and other indicators of \nthe RBL program. DLI 6 will resolve the gaps and inefficiencies in the M&E systems. 36  \n \n37.  Management information system. The MIS used for BISP operations is fragmented and \nworks in silos; its design is not fully aligned to business needs or to automation (para. 10). The \n \n36 Program Monitoring and Evaluation Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n \n ", "13 \nplan is to develop a study on comprehensive business process mapping and system requirement, \nwhich will be the foundation for the design and development of an integrated platform to support \nend-to-end automation of BISP operations using a unified platform. User training will build \ncapacity and ease cross-functional reporting mechanisms, improve program monitoring, and \npromote informed decision-making.  \n \n38.  Financial  management  system.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  BISP \nconcluded that overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial. The conclusion is \nbased  on  specific  weaknesses  identified  in  planning  and  budgeting,  financial  management \nstaffing, accounting, financial reporting, and information systems (para. 10). BISP does not have \nin place a comprehensive risk management framework, and the settlement of internal audit and \nexternal audit observations is delayed. A financial management action plan has been prepared \nand incorporated into the PAP, which will help reduce the risks.37 DLIs 3\u20136 will help leverage \nsubstantial action to ensure full implementation of the program\u2019s PAP. \n \n39.  Procurement. The overall pre-mitigation procurement risk is assessed as substantial. \nProcurement system assessment identified some risks and weaknesses in governance and \nprocedures (para. 10). DLI 5 and the PAP will help mitigate the risks, such as by strengthening \nthe capacity of the BISP Procurement Wing, including the appointment of an adequate number of \nprocurement staff. DLI 5 includes annual third-party fiduciary reviews covering procurement \nscope, update of the procurement manual to reflect recent changes in the Federal  Public \nProcurement Regulatory Rules, and clarification of roles and responsibilities of various wings \ninvolved in procurement and contract management. BISP will post its procurement plan at the \nstart of each fiscal year, develop milestones and contract activity tracking sheets to take timely \nactions, activate the online complaint handling system, and limit the number of contracts subject \nto direct contracting to ensure transparency and competitiveness.       \n \n40.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government \nand BISP.38 \n \n41.  Safeguard systems. The program safeguard system currently in place at BISP is broadly \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  screening  process  during \nimplementation will follow RBL policy and exclude activities with significant impacts from the \nprogram scope. An assessment of the safeguard systems (i) examined those of the Government \nof Pakistan and BISP, as well as BISP\u2019s related implementation practices and capacity; and (ii) \nsuggested safeguard actions where significant gaps with the principles of the ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement were identified. The assessment builds on existing knowledge and experience \nof ADB and BISP, as well as on an in-depth analysis carried out during program preparation, \nwhich was validated through discussions with BISP and stakeholders.39  \n \n42.  Environmental safeguards. Absent any civil engineering infrastructure interventions, the \nproject has been categorized as C. No significant environmental risks are associated with the \nentire program. The potentially minor environmental risks could be lopping of trees for fuelwood, \ninadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, and use of plastic waste either as fuel or as a fire-\n \n37 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 ADB. 2021.

Such risks will be mitigated by adopting measures and following procedures as specified \nin the program safeguard systems assessment. \n \n43.  Social  safeguards.  The  program  is  categorized  C for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will not involve physical or \neconomic displacement of people in the program area. In the absence of any specific law to \nprotect indigenous peoples, the government endorses the safeguard policies of ADB and the \nWorld Bank, which recognize the Kalash as the only indigenous peoples in Pakistan. Although \nmost of the Kalash live in abject poverty, only 3%\u20134% are BISP beneficiaries while most were left \noutside the scope at the time of the first BISP survey. To ensure that indigenous peoples derive \nequal benefits from the program, the PAP contains a safeguard action for registration of the \nKalash in the NSER, with consideration given to cultural and linguistic barriers. BISP will ensure \nthat (i) private schools will be included in the list of eligible schools for education CCT, and (ii) \nsuitable BISP facilitation centers are set up in the Kalash valleys for CCT-HN.  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n44.  Successive governments have shown commitment to keep BISP fully funded, including \nwhen public finances were under significant pressure. Despite external balance difficulties and \nthe need to control the fiscal deficit, the government has financed from its own resources close to \n90% of the expenditures of BISP since its inception. Strong government support for funding is \nexpected to continue and is reflected in the government\u2019s commitment expressed in a loan \ncovenant providing for an obligation of the Government of Pakistan to ensure adequate annual \nbudgetary allocation for BISP for the purpose of the RBL program implementation. Government \nfinances are projected to improve: macroeconomic forecasts indicate projected growth, declining \ninflation rate, and sustainable fiscal deficit and public debt (para. 4). \n \nD.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n45.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.40 The overall benefits and impacts of the program \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nResults.
