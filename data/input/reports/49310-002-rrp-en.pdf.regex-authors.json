THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Yunnan Lincang Border Economic Cooperation \nZone Development Project. \n \n2.  The project will address cross-border trade capacity, border connectivity, and urban and \nsocial development issues in the Cangyuan Wa, Gengma Dai and Wa, and Zhenkang counties in \nLincang  Prefecture;  and  support  Yunnan  Province  in  enhancing  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration (RCI) under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program, focusing on economic \ncorridor development. It is expected to enhance RCI in the Shan border province of Myanmar by \nproviding benefits to Myanmar nationals who trade, work, and use social services in the project \ncounties. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Remote location and high poverty levels. Lincang Prefecture is situated in the remote \nsouthwest region of Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar, and is characterized by \nsignificant urban and rural poverty. Per capita gross domestic product in the prefecture reached \nCNY21,967 in 2016 up 10.6% over 2015, however the annual disposable income of urban \nresidents was CNY22,901 per capita, well below the PRC average. The counties of Cangyuan \nWa and Zhenkang are officially designated as national poverty counties, and are home to a large \nshare of the prefecture\u2019s urban poor. Many Myanmar nationals live and work in these counties, \nwhich are located on the PRC\u2013Myanmar border. Most are seasonal workers who increasingly \nsecure manual jobs in factories established near the land ports and border cities of Lincang \nPrefecture. Many people from Myanmar use hospitals and schools in the three project counties \nin preference to the poor municipal services available in Myanmar. Most of the seasonal workers \nbelong to ethnic minorities, which account for a significant proportion of the population in the three \ncounties: 93.9% in Cangyuan Wa County (Wa is the major ethnic group), 52.2% in Gengma Dai \nand Wa County, and 31.5% in Zhenkang County. \n \n4.  Regional cooperation and integration potential. Lincang Prefecture\u2019s location and  \n300 kilometer (km) border with Myanmar provide the potential for it to become an important trade \ngateway by which the PRC can reach key Indian Ocean ports, and thereby facilitate access to \nSouth Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Lincang Prefecture complements other border regions \nof Yunnan by enabling the growing trade between the PRC and Myanmar, which reached  \n$9.7 billion in 2015, up from $3.6 billion in 2010. Much of the trade originates at the local level, \nand is conducted largely by private sector small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In May \n2017,  the  ministries  of  commerce  of  the  PRC  and  Myanmar  signed  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  for  the  joint  development  of  border  economic  cooperation  zones.  Lincang \nPrefecture\u2019s comparative advantage is its location\u2014along the shortest route from Kunming to \nMyanmar\u2019s Kyaukpyu Port, on the Bay of Bengal. Yunnan\u2019s economic and social development \nstrategies have highlighted the potential for the border areas of Lincang Prefecture to become an \nimportant manufacturing and logistics hub along an economic corridor currently being developed \nthrough major investment projects such as the Kunming\u2013Mandalay highway and the freight \nrailway linking Kunming to Kyaukpyu. \n \n5.  Development  needs.  Lincang  Prefecture\u2019s  poor  infrastructure  and  the  low \ncompetitiveness of its second- and third-tier cities are hindering the enhancement of cross-border ", "2 \ntrade, and the achievement of sustainable economic and social development. The existing \ncustoms and quarantine inspection facilities at Qingshuihe, the prefecture\u2019s main land port, are \ninadequate to handle the border crossing point\u2019s growing trade volume. Further, the current \ntrading market area and warehouses are outdated and in poor condition, affecting the quality of \nlogistical services provided to local traders and SMEs. A similar situation exists in the town \nsupporting the land port. Qingshuihe\u2019s urban road network is inadequate for current residential \nand commercial needs and the lack of road capacity makes urban areas difficult to access, \ncausing economic losses and safety concerns for road users and pedestrians. Access to basic \nutilities is limited\u201426% of households lack access to clean piped water and 29% are not \nconnected to the sewerage system. Municipal solid waste (MSW) management capacity is limited, \nsorting  facilities  are  lacking,  and  collection  systems  are  basic,  resulting  in  considerable \nenvironmental pollution and general nuisance. Qingshuihe is crossed by the Nanting River, which \nlacks  flood  alleviation  infrastructure;  some  areas  experience  seasonal  flooding,  causing \nsignificant economic losses. Limited customs and logistical facilities in the city and its land port \ninhibit the activity of local enterprises and traders, slowing the flow of goods across the border. In \naddition, the prefecture's border counties of Cangyuan Wa, Gengma Dai and Wa, and Zhenkang \nhave outdated social services (e.g., schools and hospitals), and are unable to serve growing \npopulations of local urban\u2013rural residents, and of Myanmar migrants. \n \n6.  Lincang Border Economic Cooperation Zone. As a first step in addressing constraints \nto cross-border trade, as well as economic and social development in Lincang Prefecture, on  \n23 September 2013 the PRC\u2019s State Council approved the establishment of a national-level \nborder economic cooperation zone that aims to (i) eliminate bottlenecks created by inadequate \ninfrastructure, (ii) promote cross-border trade and investment to improve living conditions of \nresidents, (iii) promote sustainable regional economic and social development, and (iv) strengthen \nneighborly cooperation with Myanmar. The Lincang Border Economic Cooperation Zone (LBECZ) \nis comprised of several core industrial zones covering 3.47 square kilometers and located in the \ncounties of Cangyuan Wa, Gengma Dai and Wa, and Zhenkang (including a tier 1 national port \nin Qingshuihe). To boost socioeconomic benefits, the LBECZ Management Committee has \ndevised plans to develop 200 square kilometers of adjacent land in State Council-approved core \nindustrial zones, which will provide complementary commercial and residential development \nareas; and additional industrial, logistics, and trading capacity. In light of the security situation in \nMyanmar, the LBECZ is instrumental in building cooperation dialogue with authorities in Myanmar \n(nationally and in Shan State) to enhance the development of the economic corridor beyond the \nPRC. \n \n7.  Strategic fit. The development of the LBECZ is supported by the national and provincial \nstrategic frameworks for urban development and RCI. The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for \nNational  Economic  and  Social  Development,  2016\u20132020  and  the  National  New-Type \nUrbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020 both call for the development of small and medium-sized urban \ncenters  in  key  strategic  border  areas  of  the  PRC,  and  establishment  of  border  economic \ncooperation zones.1 Similar focus for the PRC is the development of border areas and the \nenhancement of cross-border cooperation to promote connectivity and strengthen economic \npartnerships in the spirit of open regionalism. Additionally, RCI constitutes an important means to \nincrease integration with the regional and global economy, and is highlighted as a priority in the \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan. In 2016, the State Council approved a list of key border areas and \ntrade ports, and identified actions for their development, while the governments of the PRC and \n                                                \n1  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2016.

Beijing. \n ", "3 \nMyanmar began an ambitious cooperation program in 2014 intended to develop a \u201cPRC\u2013\nMyanmar corridor\u201d from Kunming to the sea port of Kyaukpyu, in which the LBECZ plays a key \nrole. The corridor includes highway and railway links, as well as key urban and logistic centers. \nMany sections of the corridor in both countries are already under construction, with others in the \nplanning and design stage. \n  \n8.  Urban development and RCI are integral to Yunnan Province\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, \nwhich emphasizes (i) strengthening cooperation with the GMS countries, (ii) participating in major \ninternational economic corridors linking Yunnan and the GMS, and (iii) serving as the gateway for \nthe PRC\u2019s southeast region.2 However, Yunnan Province is constrained by its low urbanization \nrate; despite rapid development in the Kunming area, many of the province\u2019s small and medium-\nsized cities suffer from inadequate urban infrastructure and limited connectivity. Through the \nGMS, Yunnan has been prioritizing the development of economic corridors, while highlighting the \nimportance  of cross-border  cooperation  as  a way  to  enhance the  benefits for  neighboring \ncountries, particularly Myanmar. Yunnan\u2019s RCI action plan includes priority investments for \ndevelopment of the PRC\u2013Myanmar corridor through Lincang Prefecture, which are intended for \nfinancing  by  various  sources,  including  the  PRC  and  Yunnan  governments,  multilateral \ndevelopment banks, and the private sector. \n \n9.  The project (i) supports Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in making \ncities more livable, fostering RCI, and accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) is in line with \n(a) ADB\u2019s urban and water operational plans by promoting green, competitive, and inclusive cities; \nand (b) ADB\u2019s operational plan for RCI by strengthening connectivity between economies; (iii) is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 in terms of facilitating \ninclusive urbanization and enhancing RCI; (iv) is included in the country operations business plan \nfor the PRC, 2018\u20132020, which references inclusive development of small cities; (v) is aligned \nwith the latest strategic priorities of the GMS, and (vi) is in support of the achievement of several \nsustainable development goals of the United Nations related to health, education, sanitation, \neconomic growth, and sustainable cities.3 \n \n10.  Continuity of development initiatives and lessons learned. The project is part of \nADB\u2019s continuous engagement to assist Yunnan in achieving green and sustainable urban \ndevelopment, and support the PRC in enhancing RCI. The project design incorporates lessons \nlearned from previous ADB-financed urban development projects in Yunnan, as well as in small \nand  medium-sized  cities  in  the  PRC.  These  lessons  include  enhanced  implementation \narrangements with integral capacity support from the Yunnan provincial authorities and improved \ndesign of project components in order to further support urban\u2013rural integration. The project will \nalso build on ADB\u2019s experience from recent urban development and RCI projects in strategic \nborder areas of the PRC on key issues such as construction and management of logistics and \nindustrial parks and on the role of cross-border migrant workers.4 \n \n                                                \n2  Government of Yunnan Province, State Council. 2016.

By designing a multisector project that includes \nurban, social, and trading infrastructure, ADB has strengthened a holistic approach that enhances \ncompetitive, green, and inclusive development in the small and medium-sized urban centers of \nthis border region. The project is thus aligned with the livable cities vision endorsed by both the \nPRC and ADB. Throughout the project implementation, ADB will provide recommendations to \nLBECZ regarding their master plan review process to introduce best practices in urban planning \nand development. Although the project is being implemented entirely in the PRC, ADB has \nensured cross-border spillover effects by designing each component so that Myanmar nationals \nwill also be beneficiaries. This is particularly the case for (i) trading markets and logistics parks, \nwhich will accommodate farmers and traders from Myanmar; and (ii) schools and hospitals, which \nwill benefit large numbers of children and other family members from Myanmar. Output 4 of the \nproject  (on  institutional  capacity  development)  includes  features  that  complement  the \ninfrastructure components, thereby enhancing their RCI impact. Some of these features, such as \nthose focusing on SMEs and technical and vocational education and training (TVET), will be \ndesigned to enhance the capacity of entrepreneurs and workers from Myanmar. The project will \nalso be effectively mainstreaming gender equality through its social infrastructure and services \ncomponents. For instance, the hospitals will have specialized maternity and obstetrics and \ngynecology departments promoting safe motherhood and women\u2019s reproductive health, and the \nschools will have gender-inclusive design features and will be staffed by at least 60% women. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) economic growth potential for LBECZ \nand border areas of Myanmar enhanced; (ii) benefits of RCI in LBECZ and border areas of \nMyanmar realized; and (iii) living conditions and public health of residents of LBECZ and border \nareas  of  Myanmar  improved  (footnote  1).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \ncompetitiveness of urban centers, logistics and industrial parks, and land ports in project counties \nand LBECZ enhanced.5 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Cross-border trade infrastructure improved.

Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% \nper year. The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available through the Yunnan \nProvincial Government to the Lincang Municipal Government (LMG), and to the LBECZ and \nCangyuan Wa and Zhenkang county governments, which will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest variation risks of the ADB loan. \n \n19.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil works, goods, consulting services, and capacity development activities. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Banka     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  250.0  62.07 \nGovernment  152.8  37.93 \nTotal  402.8  100.00 \na  Because two of the project counties are officially designated as national poverty counties by the government, the \nAsian Development Bank has been requested to finance more than 50% of the total project cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20.

Details are in the PAM.8 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  LMG is the executing agency; and LBECZ and Cangyuan Wa and Zhenkang county \ngovernments are the project implementing agencies. A project leading group, headed by the \nmayor of LMG and with representatives from the Lincang Municipal Finance Bureau, Lincang \nMunicipal Development and Reform Commission, and other key bureaus of Lincang municipality, \nhas  been  established  for  effective  coordination  for  the  project  implementation.  A  project \nmanagement office (PMO) has been established within LBECZ Management Committee, headed \nby the director, with staff from other LBECZ units and offices. The PMO will provide overall \nguidance, supervision, coordination, and management support for project implementation on \nbehalf of LMG. A project implementation unit has been established in each implementing agency \nfor interagency coordination, and management and implementation. The LBECZ PMO will also \nserve as the project implementation unit for LBECZ\u2019s components. Procurement (including \nconsulting services) to be financed by the loan will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time).9 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described \nin detail in the PAM (footnote 7). \n \n                                                \n8  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  ADB. 2017.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The project was assessed as technically feasible due to its compatibility with the PRC\u2019s \nengineering guidelines, regulations, topography and climate, and strategic and sector priorities. \nDesign options were compared before selecting the best technologies in terms of cost, and \nenvironmental and social impacts. Climate change adaptation measures were incorporated based \non climate risk and vulnerability assessments. The capacity-building components were based on \na needs assessment for the successful implementation and operation of project facilities. The \nPMO  will  provide  funding  and  a mechanism for  operation  and maintenance  (O&M) for  all \ninfrastructure to be developed under the project. \n \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis prepared for the overall project and individual \nsubprojects concluded the project is economically viable.10 The base case economic internal rate \nof return for the entire project is 12.5%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital. \nCalculation of the project\u2019s economic benefits considered (i) willingness to pay for incremental \nwater supply, wastewater treatment, and improved solid waste collection and treatment services; \n(ii) avoided losses and improved amenity associated with the river rehabilitation subproject;  \n(iii) welfare gains through increased production of agricultural and industrial products, and trade \nmarket and international cooperation zone cost savings for border residents; (iv) time savings, \nvehicle operating cost savings, and accident reduction for Qingshuihe border infrastructure \nsubproject; and (v) human resource returns associated with education facilities and disability-\nadjusted  life-year  values  for  hospital  subprojects.  Economic  costs  comprise  capital  costs, \nincluding physical contingencies and O&M costs. \n \n24.  Financial analysis. A financial analysis has been undertaken to establish the project\u2019s \nfinancial viability and sustainability.11 For the three revenue-generating subprojects, financial \nviability assessment was based on the comparison between the projected real financial internal \nrate of return and the weighted average cost of capital; the water subproject is assessed as \nfinancially viable as its projected financial internal rate of return exceeds the weighted average \ncost  of  capital.  The  financial  sustainability  assessment  indicates  that  the  project  county \ngovernments have sufficient funds to pay the debt service and O&M costs during operation, given \nthat the higher-level (provincial and federal) governments are expected to continue providing \nadequate budget allocations, however reliance on these allocations poses a risk to financial \nsustainability. A policy dialogue with LMG on water tariff systems to meet the PRC regulations \nand improve project sustainability is to be undertaken during implementation.12 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  A financial management assessment was conducted for LMG and the implementing \nagencies.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because  the  (i)  PMO  and \nimplementing agencies are unfamiliar with ADB financial management policy and procedures, \nincluding annual project reporting; and (ii) implementing agencies lack accounting staff for the \nreview procedure. These risks will be mitigated by contracting with financial specialists as part of \nthe project implementation consultants. A procurement capacity assessment concluded that the \noverall procurement risk for the project is moderate. The project is not the first externally financed \ndevelopment project in Yunnan. However, it is the first for LMG and the implementing agencies. \nIt was confirmed that LMG will receive advice and support from other agencies of the Yunnan \nprovincial  government  with  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  Mitigation  measures \nagreed with LMG have been incorporated into the project design, and will be closely monitored \nduring project implementation as specified in the PAM. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, LMG, and implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n                                                \n10  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 In a recent regulatory decree issued by the State Council, the Government of the PRC has made it clear that tariffs \nfor water, wastewater, and solid waste must be revised to realize cost recovery by no later than 2025. \n \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  A poverty, social, and gender analysis was carried out to assess the impacts of the project \non poor and vulnerable households, and a gender action plan (GAP) and social development \naction  plan  have  been  prepared,  and  their  implementation  will  be  monitored.13 There  are  \n288,924 project direct beneficiaries, of which 47.37% (136,851) are women; 42.80% (123,650) \nare minority beneficiaries; and 6.59% (19,037) are poor. The project will enhance regional social \ninclusiveness because Myanmar border residents will enjoy improved public facilities and social \nservices  in  the  three  project  counties,  and  share  the  benefits  from  cross-border  trade \ndevelopment. Two of the project counties are national poverty counties\u2014poverty ratios in 2016 \nwere 18.5% in Cangyuan Wa and 8.2% in Zhenkang\u2014much higher than the 5.05% average of \nLincang. Lack of public infrastructure and social facilities, low education levels, low agricultural \nproductivity, and lack of industrial competitiveness are key factors causing poverty in the project \nareas. The project will positively impact poor people, who will benefit from improved infrastructure \nand social services, increased business opportunities, and economic development. A rapid health \nimpact assessment identified health risks from both vector-borne and lifestyle-related diseases, \nand the need for expanded health services for local and migrant populations. Implementation of \na  public  health  management  plan  (to  complement  the  hospital  subproject)  using  technical \nassistance resources is being explored. \n \n28.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming and will significantly benefit \nwomen, who are primarily responsible for water collection and conservation, wastewater and solid \nwaste disposal and management, and related household activities. Women use public transport \nmore  than  men,  and  consider  traffic  safety  and  public  transport  access  improvements  as \nimportant benefits that will enhance their quality of life. The GAP will (i) ensure job opportunities \nfor women during construction and operation (30%); (ii) ensure gender-responsive physical \ndesign  features  in  the  project;  (iii)  enhance  opportunities  for  women  through  capacity \ndevelopment  (i.e.,  development  of  SMEs  and  TVET);  and  (iv)  support  women\u2019s  equitable \nparticipation in all project-related public consultations (50%). Social and gender specialists will be \nhired to ensure the effective implementation of the GAP. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \n30.  Environment  (category  A).  The  categorization  was  based  on  the  project  having \nnumerous multisector components and potential accumulative impacts to the project area. An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), including an EMP was finalized in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 25 May 2018. The EIA \nincorporates  findings  of  the  domestic  feasibility  studies,  domestic  EIAs,  climate  risk  and \nvulnerability assessment, and technical reports conducted. The domestic EIAs were approved by \nthe local environmental protection bureau in March 2018. The EMP complies with the PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. An external monitoring entity will be \nrecruited  by  the  PMO  to  perform  evaluation  and  assessment  of  the  implementation  and \ncompliance with the EMP during all stages of the project. During project preparation, two rounds \n                                                \n13 The analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB. 2012. Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis.

Safeguard Categories.  \n ", "10 \nof meaningful consultations have been conducted with all relevant stakeholders, and the findings \nwere incorporated in the project design. Any potential environmental disputes will be handled in \naccordance  with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  established  for  the  project.  Mitigation \nmeasures  identified  in  the  EMP  require  environmental  compliance  for  air  pollution,  water \ntreatment, MSW, and hospital and industrial wastes. An assessment to determine the significance \nof project impacts on and risks to biodiversity and natural resources has been conducted. \nParticular attention has been given to the potential impact on extractive commercial activity in \nMyanmar derived from enhanced border trade. The project includes specific capacity-building \nmeasures to address this important issue. \n \n31.  Climate change assessment. Construction sites are vulnerable to floods and intense \nprecipitation. The project sites should be designed with surface water interceptors and other flood \ncontrol structures to capture drainage. Supply of water to construction sites should be secured \nduring droughts. Special attention will be paid to the cutting of rubber trees in collective land \nacquired for project implementation, and carbon dioxide sequestration compensation will be built \nin. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). There are 145 households (766 persons) who \nwill be affected by the acquisition of collective farmland (1,038.37 mu) in the Mengding subproject; \n28 households (110 persons) belong to the Wa and Yi ethnic groups.15 The impacts are found to \nbe insignificant because the loss of land per household is less than 5% of their total landholdings \nand households have other sources of income. For the Cangyuan subproject, the impacts are \nfound to be marginal, as four households (20 persons) will lose about 7.65 mu of cultivated land, \nwhile one household (4 persons) will be affected by house demolition. These five households are \nfrom the Wa and Dai ethnic group. Impacts are also found to be marginal for the Zhenkang \nsubproject, where the loss of an estimated 38.24 mu of collective land will be affecting nine \nhouseholds (41 persons) from the De\u2019ang ethnic group. An estimated 125 mu of unallocated state-\nowned rubber forest land in Mengding and a 39.53 mu of state-owned construction land owned \nby a real estate company in Cangyuan will be required. For Zhenkang, where 85.26 mu of state-\nowned construction land was acquired in the past, due diligence indicated that there are no \noutstanding issues. There are three resettlement plans that have been prepared in consultation \nwith the affected persons and various stakeholders to address land acquisition and resettlement \nissues. Key information in the resettlement plans has been disclosed to the affected persons. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The ethnic population makes up 42.8% of project \nbeneficiaries. Among ethnic minority beneficiaries, Dai, De\u2019ang, Wa, and Yi minorities comprise \n83.57% of the total. Ethnic people will benefit from improved municipal infrastructure and social \nservices, and additional business and job opportunities. With the exception of one household \n(4 persons) that will be required to relocate, the 41 ethnic minority households (171 people) will \nbe marginally affected by acquisition of their farmland. An ethnic minority development plan has \nbeen prepared and endorsed by the PMO.16 \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The project has no unusual technical \nrisks, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n                                                \n15 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n16 Ethnic Minority Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nProject encounters delay in procurement and  Engage experienced loan implementation consultants to assist \nimplementation due to lack of experience at  executing and implementing agencies, aligned with training and \nexecuting and implementing agency levels  capacity development to improve management capacity, \non Asian Development Bank-funded projects  supported by enhanced monitoring and guidance by loan \nimplementation consultants \nProject encounters delay in implementation  Secure assurances from the executing and implementing \ndue to weak management and coordination  agencies on availability of adequate staffing for project \ncapacity of the project management office  management office and project implementation units to deliver \nand implementing agencies  daily management and operation functions in a timely manner \nFinancial sustainability is dependent on  Government assurances on subsidies have been included in the \ncontinued availability of upper-level  loan agreement and will continue to provide counterpart funds to \ngovernment funding to county governments  support the O&M costs of the project \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
