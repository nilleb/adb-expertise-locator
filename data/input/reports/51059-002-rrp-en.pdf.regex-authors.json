THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Azerbaijan for subprogram 2 of the Improving Governance and \nPublic Sector Efficiency Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to strengthen governance in the public sector and the \ndiversification of the economy by introducing rule-based fiscal planning in the budget systems of \nthe Government of Azerbaijan, reforming the legal and institutional structures of state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), and helping improve the business environment and access to finance for \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is the second of two subprograms included in \nthe programmatic approach that was approved in November 2017.1  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Economic crisis and countercyclical policy response. After gaining independence in \n1991, Azerbaijan registered rapid economic growth of about 11% per annum during 1995\u20132013 \nand transformed itself into a middle-income country\u2014gross national income per capita increased \nfrom $610 in 2000 to an annual average of $5,850 during 2008\u20132016. The poverty rate in 2015 \nwas  a  low  4.9%.  This  growth  was  largely  fueled  by  hydrocarbon-related  activities,  which \ncontributed 90% of the country\u2019s exports and about 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and \ngovernment income. Construction activity and bank credit induced by foreign currency inflows \nalso  propelled  the  private  economy  forward  till  2014.  However,  the  real  appreciation  that \naccompanied this economic pattern also resulted in a gradual loss of competitive productive \ncapabilities outside the extractive industry.2 The past buildup of vulnerabilities to volatility in oil \nproduction and prices revealed itself during 2015\u20132016. As oil prices plunged, the concomitant \nsharp devaluation of the national currency and the resulting distress in the asset quality of a \nbanking system that had accumulated significant currency risk exposures sent Azerbaijan into a \ncrisis.3 This led to a significant inroad into the sovereign wealth fund and a surge in nonmarketable \npublic debt ratios.4 GDP contracted by 3.1% and poverty increased to 5.9% in 2016. The \ngovernment (i) provided countercyclical fiscal stimulus; (ii)  let the exchange rate float; and \n(iii) initiated institutional reforms of the finance sector and efforts to consolidate the banking \nsystem.  \n \n                                                \n1  The program is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Azerbaijan, \n2019\u20132021. Manila. New transaction TA is proposed to support the Post-Program Engagement Framework (PPEF). \n2  Extractive industries still dominate the economy, contributing on average about 51% of GDP during 2013\u20132017, \nfollowed by services (36% of GDP) and agriculture (5.6% of GDP). Mining (90% oil and gas extraction) contributes \nabout 80% of total industrial output and more than 50% of gross capital formation. \n3  Remittances from Azerbaijanis living in oil-rich neighboring countries (mostly to rural Azerbaijan) also declined by \none third. \n4  The crash in the global oil prices from a high of $110 per barrel in 2014 to $50 in 2015 caused a significant fall in the \ncountry\u2019s foreign revenues. Two waves of sharp devaluation of the Azerbaijan manat against the United States dollar \nin 2015, large state spending on the Shah Deniz II gas field, and the rescue of a major state-owned bank almost \ntripled the government\u2019s foreign debt from 8.4% of GDP in 2014 to 22.8% of GDP in 2017. The fiscal balance of the \ncentral government budget shifted from a surplus of 2.9% of GDP in 2014 to a deficit of 4.8% in 2015. In 2016, \nwithout transfers from State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), the deficit was 13.4% of GDP. \n ", "2 \n4.  Economic and financial vulnerabilities revealed. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupported this short-term response through a $500 million countercyclical support facility loan \n(CSFL) in 2016.5 Countercyclical policy efforts and the recovery of the oil prices helped stabilize \nthe macroeconomy in 2017: GDP grew by 0.1% in 2017 and by 1.4% in 2018 (non-oil GDP grew \nby 1.8%). The economy is now forecast to grow above 2.0% in 2019, driven by non-oil growth, \nreviving oil prices, a return to growth in key regional trading partners, and the start of production \nat the Shah Deniz II gas field.6 But the external shocks of 2014\u20132016 revealed key economic and \nfinancial vulnerabilities, institutional fiscal inefficiencies, and a need to accelerate economic \ndiversification in Azerbaijan. Low economic diversification stems not only from the process of real \nappreciation and deindustrialization that accompanied Azerbaijan\u2019s recent economic history but \nalso from (i) an inefficient finance sector, (ii) a weak enabling environment for non-oil private \nsector development, and (iii) inefficiencies in the delivery of public services that the private sector \ndepends on. Handicaps in fiscal management and public sector planning stood in the way of \nproper public policy responses to these challenges and actually generated fiscal procyclical \nbiases that exacerbated macroeconomic vulnerabilities.7 The government\u2019s response to the crisis \nlaid the foundation for wider structural reforms. ADB\u2019s CSFL, approved in 2016, formalized a \ncommitment  to  a  medium-term  engagement  with  the  government  to:  (i)  strengthen  fiscal \nmanagement, by establishing medium-term fiscal and debt management frameworks; (ii) improve \npublic sector efficiency and accountability, by developing a public investment framework as well \nas SOEs reforms; and (iii) deepen the finance sector and expand the role of the private sector by \npromoting the development of SMEs. \n \n5.  Azerbaijan\u2019s development strategy. The recognition that the economy\u2019s heavy reliance \non hydrocarbon revenues posed a major risk to fiscal sustainability in the long run and masked \ndeep weaknesses in fiscal and public sector management (PSM) triggered a longer-term reform \neffort. In December 2016, the President of Azerbaijan approved the country\u2019s new development \nstrategy, the Strategic Roadmaps on National Economy Perspectives and Main Sectors of the \nEconomy,8 with three horizons: strategic vision for 2020, long-term vision 2025, and aspirational \nvision for post-2025. A key objective of the Roadmaps is to strengthen institutional mechanisms \nto deliver on policy.9 \n \n6.  Core development problem: Inefficient allocation of public resources and private \nsavings. 10  The  complex  set  of  challenges  summarized  below  contributes  to  the \nunderdevelopment of non-oil tradable sectors in the Azerbaijani economy and its significant \nvulnerability to external shocks. Root problems can be summarized in three policy areas. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof Azerbaijan for the Countercyclical Support Facility. Manila. \n6  The development of the Shah Deniz II gas field is set to almost triple Azerbaijan\u2019s annual gas production capacity. \n7  Windfall oil revenues led to an unsustainable size of public expenditures and vulnerability of the budget to the \nfluctuation of global oil prices and production volumes. SOFAZ, a sovereign wealth fund established in December \n1999, had assets totaling $39 billion (92% of 2017 GDP) in January 2019. During 2013\u20132017, SOFAZ transfers made \nup about 48% of total budget revenues. During 2015\u20132017, government expenditure in Azerbaijan averaged 36.7% \nof GDP, against an average of 27.3% of GDP for Caucasus and Central Asian countries. Expansionary budget \nspending during 2005\u20132014 contributed to real appreciation and therefore hurt the non-oil tradable sectors. \n8  President\u2019s Decree no. 1138 dated 6 December 2016 on approval of the Strategic Roadmaps on National Economy \nPerspectives and Main Sectors of the Economy. The main sectors are (i) oil and gas; (ii) agricultural production; \n(iii) SMEs; (iv) heavy industry and machinery; (v) tourism; (vi) logistics and trade; (vii) technical and vocational \neducation; (viii) social housing; (ix) financial services; (x) information and communication technology; and (xi) utilities \n(electricity, water supply and sanitation, heating, and gas supply). \n9  Among the new institutions are the Center on Analysis of Economic Reforms and Communication, Financial Market \nSupervisory Authority, Energy Regulatory Agency, Small and Medium Business Development Agency. \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "3 \n7.  Root problem area 1: No medium-term fiscal policy or planning, and ineffective \npublic debt management. The budgetary practices of the government were largely driven by ad \nhoc spending decisions with no link to sector priorities. Fiscal policy lacked medium-term planning \nand had no long-term focus on reducing the fiscal dependence on oil. Azerbaijan displayed most \nof the classical symptoms of the \u201cDutch disease\u201d that is common in countries with a large \nendowment of nonrenewable natural resources and procyclical budgets that exacerbate those.11 \nMounting fiscal pressures and lack of a structured framework to manage government finances \ncalled for structural reforms to enable an increase in fiscal space and actual multiyear prioritization \nof expenditure allocations. It was also important to delink fiscal policy from the world price of oil. \nIt was imperative to optimize the use of oil revenues by effectively implementing the recently \napproved fiscal rule and a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) to minimize sensitivity to oil \nprices, reduce macroeconomic procyclicality, and ensure a more efficient multiyear planning of \npublic resources utilization. The oil price shock and exchange-rate effects also worsened the debt \nprofile of the government. More than 70% of Azerbaijan's public debt in 2016 was in foreign \ncurrencies, which, coupled with the currency devaluations and newly needed borrowings, put \nmore stress on government finances.12 Unrecognized contingent liabilities, and implicit and \nexplicit guarantees on SOE borrowings added to debt management challenges. Until 2016, \nAzerbaijan lacked a medium-term and long-term strategic debt management framework and a \nstandardized information technology platform for recording debt transactions.13 Mounting public \ndebt and doubts about the reliability of the manually assimilated data called for the implementation \nof  a  structured  debt  strategy  and  information  technology  solutions  for  data  management. \nFundamentally, a more comprehensive approach was necessary to strengthen the government\u2019s \ncapacity to meet its financing needs (by reducing costs and better managing risks) and develop \neffective control mechanisms for other indirect and/or contingent liabilities.14 \n \n8.  Root  problem  area  2:  Ineffective  state-owned  enterprises  and  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure services. SOEs play a dominant role in Azerbaijan\u2019s oil and gas \nindustry; electricity generation and distribution; water supply and sanitation; railway, road, and air \ntransport; and telecommunication.15 Before the external shocks of 2015\u20132016, the management \nand  pricing  of these  infrastructure  services  were generally  not guided  by  (i)  cost-recovery \nprinciples (or explicitly subsidized policy purposes, such as in public service obligation contracts); \nor (ii) financial sustainability and performance targets. This resulted in recurrent operational losses \nand significant underinvestment in service provision. Fiscally inefficient support to SOE operations \nin key sectors remained the rule.16 By having to operate under tariff policies and with surplus labor \nthat did not allow for cost recovery, SOEs were, de facto, an integral part of the government\u2019s \nemployment and social policy implementation. When the sharp currency devaluation dealt a \nsevere financial shock to currency-risk-vulnerable SOEs, their systemic role in the economy of \nAzerbaijan implied that the government had to step in with direct fiscal support or guarantees to \n                                                \n11 Excessive reliance on hydrocarbons contributed to real appreciation during the oil boom, thereby undercutting the \ninternational competitiveness of the non-resource sectors and negatively affecting the export of non-resource goods. \n12 As a result of exchange rate depreciation and an increase in the fiscal deficit stemming from a decline in oil revenues \nand the absence of fiscal consolidation, the stock of public debt also increased substantially. The nominal gross debt \nas a share of GDP increased from 11% in 2014 to 28% in 2015 and further to 38% in 2016. \n13 This led to lack of coordination between cash management and debt management, manual collection and reporting \nof debt indicators, inadequate dissemination of information on debt, and data-integrity issues. \n14 The government also had no objectives to gradually reduce the dependency on oil and exposure to currency risk. \n15 Given the public-goods nature of these infrastructure services and their systemic role in the economy, inefficiencies \nand underperformance in service delivery affect most other private sector activities. \n16 The consequent fiscal risks, and the periodic, ex-post, outright fiscal outlays that were necessary were mostly \nprovided in incentive-incompatible ways (i.e., not ex ante, nor contractualized, nor performance-based). This \nperpetuated corporate management decisions that were inefficient (and, ultimately, fiscally more costly). \n \n ", "4 \nkeep key SOEs operational as a going concern. This averted disruptions in key infrastructure \nservice provision and worse consequences to the economy and population. But it also made clear \nthat private sector development in Azerbaijan requires modern and sustainable provision of \ninfrastructure services, and that the inefficient and mismanaged role of SOEs had to be rectified \nthrough policy reform. Corporatization reforms to modernize SOE management and legal ledgers \nand improving management control practices were identified as priority reforms, and so was the \nurgent  establishment  of  centralized  financial  monitoring  of  SOEs.  But  as  SOEs\u2019  recurrent \noperational losses were largely the result of ineffective policy setups and decisions, sector-\nspecific reforms are key to lifting the financial performance and autonomy of SOEs. This makes \nit a medium-term agenda for fiscally paced17 and well-sequenced reform steps to solve a \nmultitude of legacy issues in each sector.18 Fiscally sustainable and planning-relevant private \nsector participation in public services also required an effective operational framework. \n \n9.  Root  problem  area  3:  Ineffective  financial  intermediation  and  policy  support \nmechanisms to small and medium-sized enterprises. Bank credit to the private sector sharply \ndeclined  in  2016\u20132017  as  a  result  of  the  external  shocks.  A  systematic  effort  to  resolve \nnonperforming loans was crucial to avoid an overhang of nonperforming loans, as would be legal \nsystems to handle insolvency, debt resolution, recovery, and restructuring. The development of \nthe legal, regulatory, and informational underpinnings for financial and credit contracts became a \nclear policy priority for Azerbaijan. Even though 55% of SMEs voiced concern about the difficult \naccess to finance, low perception of their creditworthiness by potential lenders remained the \nbinding constraint. Azerbaijan\u2019s productive specialization is highly limited, and this affects the \nfundamental growth potential and creditworthiness of firms in non-resource tradable sectors.19 \nSMEs also faced high costs associated with entry and exit procedures, contract enforcement, \nproperty rights, and fundamental weaknesses in accessing technology. Setting up an effective \ninstitutional framework for private sector development was necessary to achieve the target, set in \nthe Strategic Roadmap on SME Development, to increase the share of SMEs in the country's \nGDP from 4% in 2015 to 15% by 2020, and to 35% by 2025. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s approach. In 2016, ADB provided short-term countercyclical support assistance \nto help mitigate the impact of the crisis in Azerbaijan. As formalized in the CSFL development \npolicy letter, ADB assistance was also sought for the preparation and implementation of structural \nreforms related to fiscal management, for improving public sector efficiency and accountability, \nand for promoting the development of SMEs. ADB\u2019s TA added significant value to its response to \nthe  request. 20  ADB\u2019s  programmatic  assistance  was  approved  in  November  2017,  with \nsubprogram 1, which supported 17 policy actions (across three reform areas). These provided \n                                                \n17 It is also important that job growth is reignited in the private sector and that more effective social safety net functions \nare established first by the government, in order for labor restructuring possibilities across major SOEs to remain \nfiscally affordable and socially feasible. This was a key challenge from the onset, which called for a more phased \nand paced approach in this particular regard. \n18 Including (i) high level of foreign debt and exchange rate vulnerability; (ii) poor financial performance and dependency \non cost-inefficient and performance-incompatible solutions of fiscal support; (iii) low accountability, transparency, and \nreporting; (iv) fragmented and incomplete discharge of the ownership function by the government; and (v) lack of \nautonomous and capable utility regulators to govern tariffs and oversee customer service. \n19 Azerbaijan\u2019s economy was relatively broad-based back in the early 1990s, when it had more than 50 products with \nrevealed comparative advantage in 10 product groups. In 2016, the country had less than 25 products with revealed \ncomparative advantage. Revealed comparative advantage indices offer a useful way of analyzing a country\u2019s \ncomparative advantage, based on demonstrated (i.e., actual) export performance. \n20 For example, by helping (i) identify critical policy actions for the program based on preparatory analysis done jointly \nwith government teams, (ii) leverage coordination with development partners to ensure that some of their TA \ninvestments could also support the design and execution of ADB\u2019s programmatic approach, and (iii) to achieve and \nsustain subprogram 1 reforms. \n \n ", "5 \nthe impetus for the subsequent reform efforts in subprogram 2. Assistance to these reform \nagendas is aligned with strategic pillar 2 of ADB\u2019s new country partnership strategy for Azerbaijan, \ni.e., to boost public sector efficiency;21 and with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priority \n6\u2014strengthen governance and institutional capacity in Asia and the Pacific through public \nmanagement  reforms  that  improve  financial  sustainability,  service  delivery,  capacity,  and \nstandards.22 ADB\u2019s current  two-pronged approach to SOE reform challenges in Azerbaijan \ncombines the fiscal and cross-sector dimension embedded in the program (in policy reform area \n2), with sector-specific reform support to SOEs in railways and energy.23 \n \nB.  Policy Reforms under Subprogram 2 and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  Policy reform area 1: Rule-based fiscal planning and debt management introduced. \nTo promote medium-term fiscal policy and planning, and put Azerbaijan on a path of fiscal \nconsolidation, and eliminate detrimental procyclical biases, it was crucial to establish multiyear \nbudget formulation and forecasting, and improve the management of public debt and fiscal risks. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government formulated fiscal rules as the basis for the national budget \nformulation.24 Laws were amended to improve public financial management. The amended law \non pensions reduced the quantum of deficit financing required for meeting pension fund liabilities \nand started to create fiscal room to prioritize the expenditure allocations to productive sectors. \n \n12.  Under subprogram 2 (details in Appendix 4, policy actions 1\u20139), the promotion of fiscal \ndiscipline and strategic resource allocation was made through (i) the formal approval of fiscal \nrules for budget making and medium-term budget planning that govern the upper limits of \ntransfers from State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) and of public debt; (ii) the introduction of a \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for all ministries; (iii) preparation of the 2020 budget \nbased on an enhanced MTFF that links macroeconomic performance with fiscal policy at the \naggregate  level  and  sets  medium-term  resource  parameters  for  all  government  agencies; \n(iv) Ministry of Finance (MOF) submission for cabinet approval of a framework to govern tax \nincentives that integrates internal frameworks to estimate the impacts of foregone tax revenue \n(as part of the decision-making process); (v) establishment of a specialized group in the MOF with \nin-house skills for the regular preparation of MTFF and MTEF and for support to line ministries, \nand attribution to a high-level coordination council of the responsibility for coordinating line \nministries\u2019 implementation of these reforms; (vi) development and approval of an implementation \nplan for  a financial management  and  information  system  and formulation  of  a  request for \nproposals on a budget preparation and allocation module; (vii) establishment of a joint working \ngroup between MOF and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population (MLSP) to \ncontinue pension reforms; (viii) government restructuring of the Public Debt Management Agency \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Azerbaijan, 2019\u20132023\u2014Promoting Diversified and Inclusive Growth. \nManila. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/510266/cps-aze-2019-2023.pdf. \n22 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n23 Two current projects are supporting Azerbaijan Railways and Azerishiq, the power distribution SOE. They aim to \n(i) strengthen  financial  management  systems  and  practices,  asset  management,  and  corporate  and  debt \nrestructuring at these SOEs; and (ii) support sector reforms, such as the introduction of public service obligation \ncontracts, development of  financial recovery plans, and proposals for cost-recovery tariffs. These activities will \nimprove the performance of the SOEs and help reduce their reliance on the government. \n24 An important advantage of a rule-based fiscal framework is a greater focus on medium-term budgetary forecasts, \nwhich in turn ensure better targeting of sector priorities. The MTEFs play an important role in improving budget and \nexpenditure management processes to ensure better use of fiscal resources in line with government priorities. The \nMTEFs for the line departments, in conjunction with a top\u2013down MTFF, are a prerequisite for effective implementation \nof expenditure rationalization. \n \n ", "6 \nby operationalizing a separate unit for debt recording and reporting in the debt management \nsystem, and expanding its mandate;25 (ix) approval of a new, comprehensive debt management \npolicy with e.g. quantitative targets to ensure sustainability of public debt and a gradual reduction \nin the ratio of debt to GDP,26 explicit ceilings on foreign currency and variable rate borrowing, \nexplicit objectives on the development of domestic debt securities markets, and significant \nrestrictions on the issuance of loans and state guarantees to SOEs and financial institutions; (x) \napproval of a new Law on State Debt by Parliament to consolidate the legal framework on public \ndebt management, including e.g. the creation of a separate safeguard fund within the state budget \nfor meeting debt service obligations related to invoked guarantees, fixing of the upper limit for \ninternal and external public debt and the amount of government guarantees to be paid over the \nyear;27 and (xi) strengthening of public debt managers\u2019 technical and functional capacity to record, \nprocess,  monitor,  report,  disseminate,  and  analyze  external  and  domestic  public  debt,  by \nestablishing the system and formalizing a service contract to operationalize it. \n \n13.  Policy reform area 2: Reforms of state-owned enterprises undertaken. Financially \nsustainable SOEs are a critical prerequisite for better public service delivery and more cost-\neffective fiscal support from the government. The actions under this output aimed to strengthen \nthe corporatization efforts of SOEs and the standardization of financial control, allowing space for \nprivate  sector  participation  in  economic  activities.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government \nformulated an action plan to improve the transparency and financial reporting of SOEs across the \nboard, including the activities to be undertaken and the role of various agencies responsible for \nthe implementation of the action plan.28 \n \n14.  Under subprogram 2 (Appendix 4, policy actions 10\u201316), the government (i) undertook the \nlegal transformation and corporatization reforms at eighteen major SOEs; (ii) implemented and \nfurther strengthened the centralized financial control of all major SOEs (which included the \nresolution of all mutual current accounts payable between SOEs and restructuring all debt-\nrepayment schedules) and centralized monitoring of their financial performance; (iii) established \na single database for all SOEs and implemented public disclosure requirements of financial \naudits; (iv) approved strategic reform plans of nine major SOEs, which are being implemented; \n(v) approved a modern set of standards of corporate governance for all SOEs, along with annual \nreporting requirements, and defined higher-level institutional roles for compliance monitoring and \nenforcement; (vi) operationalized international accounting standards across most large SOEs, \nand introduced international financial reporting standards; and (vii) introduced guidelines to \nensure risk allocation transparency in all public\u2013private partnership proposals. \n                                                \n25 The new public debt management agency now has an explicit role in monitoring SOE-related fiscal contingencies. \n26 Strategy for medium and long-term management of public debt in the Republic of Azerbaijan approved by the \nPresident\u2019s Decree No. 424 dated 24 August 2018. In 2019, the public debt ratio is expected to decrease to 19% of \nGDP, and then gradually to 12% of GDP by 2025. Most importantly, the government envisages to avoid new foreign \nborrowing for public investment projects in the short term. This is a key enabler of fiscal consolidation objectives \nsupported by ADB\u2019s ongoing programmatic assistance. \n27 This was followed by (i) approval of implementing regulations (by presidential decree) setting the authority to borrow \nand procedures for negotiating and contracting external loans; (ii) government approval of regulations to strengthen \ninstitutional processes regarding contracting of loans and guarantees by the state; and (iii) government approval of \ncomplementing guidelines for SOE borrowings (on their own risk, without state involvement or guarantee), e.g., by \nsetting out clear annual borrowing limits for each SOE, and specifying the approval process for SOE borrowings. \n28 Centralized monitoring was introduced to closely oversee and report to the government the financial performance of \nSOEs and their utilization of funds. To ensure greater adherence of SOEs to international practices, the government \ndrafted, consulted, and submitted for approval comprehensive corporate governance rules to guide the selection of \ndirectors, and internal audit, accounting, and financial reporting procedures for major SOEs. To reduce the footprint \nof the state in the economy, the government also stepped up privatization efforts for non-utility SOEs during \nsubprogram 1. \n \n ", "7 \n15.  Policy  reform  area  3:  Enhanced  access  to  finance  and  improved  business \nenvironment. The interventions under this output aimed to diversify the economy by creating \nconditions  for  sustainable  private-sector-led  growth.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government \ninitiated preparations to improve the business environment,29 strengthened deposit insurance by \nrecapitalizing the Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund, and developed a model for risk-based \npricing of premiums to be charged from banks.30 The government also provided budget support \nto the National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support to enable low-cost loans for entrepreneurs in \nagriculture, tourism, and services.  \n \n16.  The government, under subprogram 2 (Appendix 4, policy actions 17\u201322), (i) passed \namendments to enabling legislation related to encumbrance of movable properties, insolvency \nand bankruptcy law, and mortgage law; (ii) operationalized the Credit Bureau and a full-fledged \nsecured transactions system; and (iii) amended the Law on Banks to make credit information \nreporting mandatory and compliant with financial privacy rules. The government also implemented \nsignificant legislative and technical reforms to improve the ease of doing business, and as a result \nit was rated by the World Bank as the world\u2019s fourth-best reformer in 2018.31 The government \nalso established an entrepreneurship development fund as a public legal entity to replace and \nresolve the shortcomings of the National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support. The new fund offers \na broader range of services to promote entrepreneurs\u2019 access to finance, and has stronger \nfinancial governance and risk management capacity. Finally, the government operationalized a \nnew policy-setting public legal entity to coordinate and improve the mechanisms of support for \nentrepreneurship development activities in Azerbaijan, the SME Development Agency (SMEDA), \nand launched a full-fledged tax initiative to promote entrepreneurship. \n \n17.  Subprogram 2 implementation challenges and adjustments. At the time of the ADB \nBoard approval of subprogram 1, 22 indicative reform objectives were set for subprogram 2. Some \nof  these  were  refined  further  during  subprogram  2  implementation,  based  on  government \ncapacity, reform circumstances, and the earlier feedback from the ADB Board.32 Nonetheless, \nsubprogram 2 reforms progressed broadly as expected in terms of the indicative targets that were \nset in November 2017. The adjustments that were required to achieve the underlying policy \nobjectives reflect concrete reform realities on the ground and are presented in a supplementary \nlinked document.33 All subprogram 2 policy actions were achieved before end-September 2019. \nAll subprogram 1 policy actions were sustained to date. No reforms were rolled back. \n                                                \n29 This included (i) legislation to improve citizen\u2019s access to financial services and credit consumer rights, and (ii) the \nsetup of a credit guarantee fund for SMEs to facilitate credit access compliant with corporate governance. \n30 This ensured that the Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund remained operational encouraged local currency deposits. \n31 These policy actions were complemented by (i) approval of the charter of a business environment commission \nserving as a collegial body to develop the necessary legislation and administration; (ii) operationalization of online \nsingle windows for electronic invoicing (e-invoicing), filing of tax returns for social security and corporate income tax, \nas well as application of licenses and permits; and (iii) significant reductions in tax compliance costs to promote \nformalization and introduction of tax ombudsmen concepts and institutions. \n32 Board approval discussions of subprogram 1 had highlighted, in relation to subprogram 2, (i) areas where more \ngranularity was necessary, (ii) reform targets in which sequencing and pace needed to be better adjusted to reform \ncomplexities, and (iii) reform areas where ADB and the government could be more ambitious. \n33 Subprogram 2 Implementation Challenges and Adjustments (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). In some areas, the effectiveness of the policy dialogue resulted in more concrete reform achievements and in \nnew associated reform efforts. Some key legal reforms also progressed faster than originally expected. Others were \nonly found necessary during implementation of subprogram 2, and were pursued henceforth. In two cases, the pace \nwas slowed in recognition of the reforms\u2019 size and complexity; for example, in the area of medium-term budgeting, \ninternational experience shows that it takes a minimum of three budget cycles to prepare an MTFF and sometimes \ntake up to 10 years before the framework is fully operational and consistently applied. The original targets in this \nregard were clearly too ambitious. \n \n ", "8 \n18.  Post-program engagement framework (PPEF). The policy dialogue under subprogram \n2 was successful in charting several follow-up reform steps that are still crucial and could benefit \nfrom further ADB support. The ADB team and the authorities agreed on a PPEF through which \nthe parties can jointly prepare proposals for the next phase of associated reforms, i.e., reforms \nthat are in natural sequence or necessary for subprogram 2 reforms to yield their full impact. As \nreflected  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023,  a  second  ADB  programmatic \nassistance engagement is being planned for 2021\u20132022. The PPEF (i) will thus help maintain the \ncurrent reform momentum and feed into the design of that forthcoming processing effort, ad (ii) \ncontains a non-exhaustive list of reform preparation activities to take place in 2019\u20132020.34 \n \n19.  Evaluation of ADB engagement \u2013 lessons and value added. The country assistance \nprogram evaluation (CAPE), 2011\u2013201735 rated ADB support for public sector management \n(PSM) overall successful, with good scores on all evaluation criteria; its strengths (such as \nproactive  engagement  and  support  for  macroeconomic  policy  reform)  outweighed  the \nweaknesses in other areas of ADB assistance in Azerbaijan.36 The ongoing implementation of the \nprogram was a main element of this evaluation. The CAPE recommended that ADB continue to \nsupport policy reforms, since its past and ongoing successes could be credited to the iterative \napproach that proved valuable in areas such as fiscal and SOE tariff reforms.37 It recognized that \n\u201cADB was one of the few development partners supporting the authorities\u2019 structural reforms. \nADB\u2019s support focused on the necessary conditions for economic diversification, particularly the \nMTFF. While much remains to be done for these reforms to bear fruit, ADB\u2019s presence has helped \nthe government stay the course.\u201d ADB assistance was deemed crucial in incentivizing \u201cthe \ngovernment to remain constant in the implementation of reforms, even in trying times.\u201d38 ADB\u2019s \nTA was also crucial in enabling subprogram 2 and the underlying policy dialogue to incorporate \nimportant lessons from experiences with fiscal and public financial management, finance sector, \nand SOE reform programs of other countries.39 Lessons from the implementation of subprogram 1 \nwere also key. The policy dialogue under subprogram 2 often emphasized the need to promote \nmore context-specific solutions that only contemporaneous reform analysis can unveil.40 This \nmade full use of the flexibility and timeline advantages of ADB\u2019s programmatic assistance. The \nexperience of subprogram 2 confirmed the suitability of this modality to the nature of the multi-\nspeed reform agenda in Azerbaijan. Pursuing realistic policy actions is critical to ensuring that the \nreform program can be carried out effectively and that implementing agencies\u2019 officials remain \n                                                \n34 Post-Program Engagement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Azerbaijan, 2011\u20132017. ADB: \nManila. \n36 The overall assessment of the PSM program was successful, with individual ratings of relevant, effective, efficient, \nlikely sustainable, and an impact deemed satisfactory. \n37 Para. 51 of the CAPE acknowledges that \u201cto the extent that the PSM operations managed by ADB staff based in \nManila are being supported by the resident mission, ADB remains in continuous contact with the government, \nespecially with the two leading agencies in the reform effort\u2014the MOF and MOE. This constant access has allowed \nADB to address the issues that come up, as well as to provide sound advice when it is needed.\u201d \n38 Para. 58 of the CAPE acknowledges that \u201cthe policy matrix approved with the programmatic series for Azerbaijan is \na good example of how incentives may be created, while framing the reform agenda within conditions that help the \ngovernment stay its course.\u201d \n39 In addition to the TA approved with the CSFL, ADB supported reforms under subprogram 2 through various other \nTA initiatives, like a regional TA window in ADB. ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Governance and \nCapacity Development as Driver of Change. Manila. Both the Financial Markets Supervision Authority and the \nSMEDA are still currently benefiting from parallel TA and staff consultancy. A new TA project will also be supporting \nthe development of tax administration capacity of the government as well as MOF\u2019s tax forecasting capacity. ADB. \n2019. Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Strengthening Tax Policy and Administration Capacity. Manila. \n40 Para. 59 of the CAPE recognizes that \u201cThe experience with the PSM program also suggests it is worthwhile \nbuttressing some of the reforms with more capacity building, especially via TA. TA is the best instrument that ADB \ncan use to help a reforming government team succeed.\u201d \n \n ", "9 \nfully connected with the process. In fact, some indicative targets for subprogram 2 had directly \nincorporated some aspirations from  the government\u2019s own reform  plans to promote formal \nownership of reform targets41 which, in a few cases, proved too optimistic. In other cases, interim \nbut crucial process-oriented milestones that were absent from official reform plans were still \ncaptured in the program, making the policy matrix de facto a more complete interim roadmap for \nand  helped  the  formation  of  necessary  interagency  consensus. 42  This  enabled  a  more \npragmatically paced and sequenced approach during the implementation of subprogram 2. This \nflexibility  was  only  possible  under  the  programmatic  modality,  which  also  helped  catalyze \nassistance in specific reform efforts from other development partners, such as Switzerland\u2019s State \nSecretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). \n \n20.  Development partner coordination. Multilateral agencies such as ADB, the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Union, and the World Bank as well as \nbilateral donors such as SECO provide support to PSM, private sector development, and the \nfinance sector in Azerbaijan.43 The European Union, for example, assists the revision of the public \nexpenditure and financial accountability action plan. SECO provides technical support to MOF to \nrun the modern public debt management system that ADB\u2019s TA funded and helped set up. Partner \nactivities are coordinated by the institutions themselves. For example, SECO coordinates private \nsector development assistance. In 2018, ADB initiated and now leads donor coordination efforts \nin PSM. Coordination with the International Monetary Fund also takes place regularly. Key \nrecommendations of International Monetary Fund missions are aligned with the objectives of \nADB\u2019s programmatic engagement in Azerbaijan. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n21.  The effect of the reforms that the program helped achieve is improved allocative efficiency \nof public and private resources. Reforms under the program, sustained by the proposed PPEF, \ncan produce tangible upgrades in resource allocation efficiency in Azerbaijan, i.e., strengthen its \npublic policy capacity to promote the development of non-oil tradable sectors and reduce the \ncountry\u2019s significant vulnerability to external shocks.44 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n22.  The government has requested a regular loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method, \nthe average maturity is 10.39 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan, \nto be disbursed in a single tranche to help meet the government\u2019s development financing needs, \nis projected to be 12% of the total financing needs for 2019 (about $2.1 billion). The remaining \ngap will be filled by project loans and domestic bonds. The program has considered the recently \napproved fiscal rules, the estimated support from other partners, and debt sustainability. \n   \n                                                \n41 Para. 49 of the CAPE acknowledges that \u201canchoring the PSM program in the government\u2019s own program created a \ndeep sense of ownership.\u201d \n42 As often observed in other \u201cpost-transition\u201d contexts, promoting analytical cooperation between agencies frequently \nrequires setting formal requirements for it under a policy matrix to support continuity in policy dialogue. \n43 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44 To rectify methodological inconsistencies, adjustments were made to performance indicators in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 1: Fiscal Financing Needs \n($ billion) \nItem  2017  2018p  2019f \nCentral government overall deficit  0.790  0.131  1.190 \nDebt repaymenta  0.668  0.920  0.915 \n  Total financing needed  1.458  1.051  2.105 \np = provisional, f = forecast. \na Official repayments of foreign currency debt principal. \nSources: Official figures for 2017-2018.

The  Central  Bank  of  Azerbaijan,  Financial  Market \nSupervisory Authority, Ministry of Economy (and SMEDA), MLSP, and MOF are implementing \nagencies. The implementation period for subprogram 2 was from December 2017 to September \n2019. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The loan closing date for \nsubprogram 2 is 27 December 2019. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n24.  The attached TA for Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency is estimated to \ncost $875,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-Others). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The TA is proposed to support the government in \nthe implementation of the PPEF (summarized in para. 18), and in associated reforms. The \nsequencing of new reform efforts and TA activities will proceed along the same three policy reform \nareas of subprogram 2, i.e., supporting the implementation of rule-based fiscal planning and a \npublic debt management strategy, assisting SOE reforms and private sector participation in \ninfrastructure services, and enhancing access to finance and entrepreneurship. MOF is the \nproposed executing agency. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan, Financial Market Supervisory \nAuthority,  Ministry  of  Economy  (and  SMEDA),  MLSP,  and  MOF  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. The TA will also include resources to explore gender mainstreaming opportunities \nduring the implementation of the PPEF. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  Safeguards.  Following ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram 2  is \nclassified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or \nlead to involuntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n26.  Governance. Fighting corruption has been high on the government\u2019s agenda since 2005, \nwhen Azerbaijan set up and operationalized the Commission on Combating Corruption. Regional \nanticorruption bodies reflect these efforts and suggest that fundamental improvements have \noccurred. Nonetheless, global indexes on perceived levels of corruption show the need to further \nenhance transparency and accountability in PSM and service delivery, strengthen the rule of law, \nand ensure equal treatment for all businesses. The program supports efforts to reduce corruption \nin the country in various indirect ways, and as a whole aims to create more transparency and a \nmore conducive environment for private-sector-led growth. This will continue under the PPEF. \n ", "11 \nThe government has made important progress in strengthening country systems for transparency \nand  accountability  in  the  extractive  industries.  Azerbaijan  joined  the  Extractive  Industries \nTransparency Initiative (EITI) at its inception in 2004 and was the first country to be validated as \nfully compliant with EITI standards in 2009. It withdrew from the EITI on 10 March 2017\u20141 day \nafter it was suspended over complaints about national legal treatment of civil society organizations \n(CSOs)\u2014noting that the EITI had shifted priorities away from its original mandate.45 Despite this \nwithdrawal, high-level commitment to continuing revenue transparency in relation to Azerbaijan\u2019s \nextractive industries remained in evidence.46 On 5 April 2017, the President of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan  signed  the  decree  \u201cOn  additional  measures  to  increase  accountability  and \ntransparency in the extractive industries,\u201d stating that all extractive industry information should be \ndisclosed to its full extent in line with international standards. Pursuant to this, the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Commission (EITC) was established under the auspices of SOFAZ, \nwhich also houses the EITC Secretariat.47 This commission assumed its activities in April 2017 \nand agreed on a stakeholder engagement process that involves CSOs in reforms relating to \nextractive industry transparency, such as implementing the Roadmap for Beneficial Ownership \nDisclosure.48 ADB\u2019s TA support for the latter is helping sustain this progress and the momentum \ngenerated by the leadership of SOFAZ.49 Under its official legal mandate, EITC established a new \nframework  for  the  implementation  of  transparent  reporting  processes.  All  relevant  parties, \nincluding CSOs, are actively involved. In late 2018, the EITI revised its requirements for CSO \nfreedoms. ADB will continue to emphasize, through the ongoing TA dialogue, the overall benefits \nfor Azerbaijan in rejoining the EITI.50 \n \n27.  Poverty, social, and gender. The majority of Azerbaijan\u2019s people have to make do with \nvery low incomes to provide for their basic needs. The welfare system is underfunded and largely \nvulnerable to external shocks, with state funds heavily relying on transfers from SOFAZ. However, \nthe recent economic downturns did not lead to spending cuts on social protection, as could have \nbeen expected. The MLSP focused on raising the minimum wage, minimum pension, and social \nallowances in 2018 and 2019 to somehow offset the real value loss in social transfers caused by \nthe crisis, and is preparing for social assistance reforms to be initiated in 2020.51 ADB\u2019s TA played \na part in this, and the MLSP is currently charting its reform approach. The program aims to \nimprove long-term financing and create enough fiscal space for better-resourced and better-\ntargeted  public  policy  implementation.  This  is also  expected to  have a  positive  impact  on \nemployment creation for non-oil economic activity. Targeted expenditures based on the improved \nmedium-term fiscal  and  expenditure frameworks  can  also  improve  and  sustain  health  and \n                                                \n45 Member countries implement EITI standards on a voluntary basis. If they fail to do so, no sanctions per se arise \n(other than downgrade or suspension). Disputes over the national legal treatment of CSOs in Azerbaijan led to the \ndecision of EITI to suspend Azerbaijan on 9 March 2017. \n46 As Azerbaijan still seeks to attract significant investment to further develop its extractive industries, it needs to meet \ngrowing global expectations of stronger governance, accountability, and transparency, including on beneficial owners \nof companies operating in extractive industries. Azerbaijan has been and will be in competition with many other \ncountries over such financing, and countries that offer more transparency are likely to be more successful. \n47 The EITC membership incorporated the social development minister recently. \n48 The EITC has since produced annual reports to stakeholders following the standards of EITI reports. \n49 ADB\u2019s TA work with the EITC Secretariat and SOFAZ (reports are publicly available on the SOFAZ website) has \nincluded consultation exercises and events, the latest of which in February 2019 suggesting separate beneficial \nowner legislation that the President\u2019s Office is expected to submit to Parliament for approval. Another broad-based \npublic consultation is set to take place by the end of 2019 to finalize legal and regulatory proposals. ADB. 2016. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan for Shah Deniz Stage II Investment Plan. Manila. \n50 Some ADB shareholders also expressed hope for such outcome during informal consultations about the program. \n51 The minimum salary was raised from AZN180 to AZN250 (39% increase), effective since September 1, 2019. \nAccording to the MLSP, this will benefit 600,000 government employees and require an estimated additional $144 \nmillion-equivalent of fiscal resources for Sep-Dec 2019, and about $359 million-equivalent for 2020. \n \n ", "12 \neducation outcomes and strengthen the social safety net. While women and other vulnerable \ngroups are expected to benefit through more employment and better health and education \noutcomes, these are all indirect results of the program reforms. Subprogram 2 is categorized as \nno gender elements as it includes only the setting up of resource centers for women entrepreneurs \nin three more regions (under policy action 16). More gender mainstreaming opportunities will be \nexplored  during  the  implementation  of  the  PPEF  and  in  subsequent  subprograms.  Initial \ndiscussions with MOF resulted in the interest to consider gender-responsive budgeting and a \nshort-term TA has been designed towards this end. \n \n28.  Risks and mitigating measures. The risks to the program are discussed in the risk \nassessment and management plan, along with mitigation factors and measures. 52 Given that the \nproposed subprogram 2 actions have been achieved already, and risks considered earlier did not \nmaterialize, the overall risk assessment is moderate (pre-mitigation). Fiduciary arrangements for \nbudget support are acceptable, and the strengthening of public financial management is one of \nthe key objectives of the program. While no significant risks of mismanagement of resources at \nthe executing level are expected, related issues as identified in the assessment are also targeted \nin the proposed loan and ADB\u2019s ongoing TA. By default, this provides levels of engagement and \nmonitoring  that,  at  this  stage,  deliver  an  important  degree  of  fiduciary  comfort.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the different implementing agencies. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n29.  The Government of Azerbaijan and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the loan agreement. \n \nVI.
