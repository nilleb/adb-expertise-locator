I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Qinghai Rural Water Resources Management \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project is located in the counties of Hualong, Jianzha, and Xunhua in eastern \nQinghai Province. This document is based on the consultants\u2019 studies, surveys, and reports; the \nfindings  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  missions;  and  discussions  with  government \nagencies, stakeholders, beneficiaries, and development partners.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Poverty and rural development. Although national economic growth has been at an \nannual average of about 9% from 1991 to 2009, reducing poverty and increasing rural incomes \nremain daunting challenges in the PRC. In spite of this growth, the PRC continues to be a lower-\nmiddle-income country with about 254 million people still living on less than $1.25 per day.3 \nUsing the PRC\u2019s official poverty line, there were about 40 million poor in the PRC in 2009; and \nthe  poverty  incidence  was  4.2%,  affecting  predominantly  rural  areas.4 Income  inequalities \nbetween the eastern and western PRC have also risen, and the income gap between rural and \nurban households has widened considerably since the late 1970s. Constraints such as low farm \nproductivity, poor rural infrastructure, lack of access to rural finance, and poor education and skills \nlimit economic opportunities for the rural poor, who are vulnerable to economic and social risks.  \n \n4.  Qinghai  Province,  located  in  the  upper  Yangtze  and  Yellow  River  valleys  in  the \nnortheastern part of the Qinghai\u2013Xizang Plateau, is one of the poorest in the PRC because of \nits remote location, mountainous landscape, and extreme climate.5 It has a relatively small \npopulation of about 5.6 million, distributed over 720,000 square kilometers, with 59% of the \npeople living in rural areas. The poverty incidence is high in Qinghai. In 2009, about 1.38 million \npeople, or 24.7% of the total population, have incomes below the official national poverty line. \nThe poverty incidence is about 39% in the project counties of Hualong, Jianzha, and Xunhua. \nThe people of Qinghai also experience high levels of no-income poverty, including poor access \nto education, safe drinking water, and health services.  \n \n5.  Irrigation  and  agriculture.  Irrigation  water  is  essential  to  sustaining  agriculture \nthroughout the year in most regions of the PRC, including Qinghai. Agriculture remains an \nimportant sector in Qinghai, and meeting water needs by improving water management has \nbecome the major agricultural development priority in the province. The project area is mainly \nserved by small lift irrigation pumps that were built in the early 1970s. They were designed to \npump water directly from the Yellow River using two or more lifts of up to 50 meters in height \neach. The pumping stations and on-farm irrigation systems have fallen into disrepair because of \na lack of funding, poor management, and a lack of farmers\u2019 active involvement. Irrigation water \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Qinghai Rural Water Resources Management Project. Manila.  \n3  World Bank. 2009. From Poor Areas to Poor People: China\u2019s Evolving Poverty Reduction Agenda. Washington, \nDC. \n4  The PRC\u2019s official poverty line in 2009 was CNY1,196 per capita per year. \n5  Xizang is also known as Tibet Autonomous Region. \n ", "2 \nuse efficiency in the project area is estimated at 35%, which is lower than the national average \nof 45%.6 Rising pumping and agricultural input costs are forcing farmers to find alternative \nsources of income. Water is clearly a limiting resource in the project area because distribution \ncosts are high and local governments of the project counties have limited delivery capacity. As a \nresult, about 21% of farmland has been abandoned in the project counties. \n \n6.  Since the late 1990s, the government has promoted participatory irrigation management \n(PIM) and initiated steps to transfer secondary and tertiary irrigation canal management to water \nusers  associations  (WUAs).  The  legal  framework  for  the  development  of  the  WUAs  was \nestablished in mid 2000s. By end 2009, about 40,000 WUAs had been established in the PRC. \nThese WUAs manage about 22.7% of the country\u2019s total irrigated area. Qinghai Province, \nhowever, lags far behind in PIM. The province has just a few pilot WUAs, and these were \nestablished on a township basis rather than by hydrological units of the irrigation system which \nhas been proven a more efficient system worldwide. The Qinghai Provincial Water Resources \nDepartment,  local  government  agencies,  and  the  WUAs  have  not  been  able  to  achieve \naccountable service delivery or recover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. They are \ntrapped with a vicious cycle of poor irrigation performance and low collection of service charges, \nwhich in turn makes irrigation performance unsustainable.  \n \n7.  In Qinghai, agricultural productivity is low because of the unreliability of water delivery \nservice and poor agronomic practices.7 The average wheat yield during 2005\u20132007 in Qinghai \nwas about 3,600 kilograms per hectare (ha), which was only 76% of the national average. From \n1998 to 2009, the annual average increase in wheat yield, one of the main crops in Qinghai and \nthe project area, was just 0.6%; by comparison, the national average increase during the same \nperiod was 2.5%. \n \n8.  Land degradation. The PRC faces serious land degradation problems, with more than \n40% of its land increasingly affected by wind erosion, salinization, and desertification.8 Much of \nthe land degradation is a result of poor land use decisions over a long period. Many parts of the \nwestern region, including Qinghai, have low agricultural productivity compared with eastern and \nsouthern provinces. Fragile soils, widespread erosion, water scarcity, and increasingly erratic \nrainfall patterns are among the factors that have reduced the productive capacity of agricultural \nand pastoral lands, and led to a loss of watershed protection functions. \n \n9.  Agricultural support system. Agricultural extension services have played an important \nrole in supporting agricultural productivity and reducing poverty in the PRC. Public agricultural \nextension agencies at all administrative levels play a key role in helping farmers access new \nagricultural technologies and market information. However, they often have limited outreach and \ndo not deliver technical advice that is responsive to farmers\u2019 needs. Currently, the services are \nprovided mainly through local agriculture bureaus, although private extension providers such as \nuniversities and private agro-enterprises have recently emerged.  \n \n10.  Climate change. Agricultural production is particularly vulnerable to climate change. \nClimate-change-related impacts can include a decline in crop yield, moisture loss, changes in \n                                                \n6  Irrigation water use efficiency refers to the percentage of crop water use against total water supply into the \nirrigation system. \n7  Agronomic practices refers to the application of the various soil and plant sciences to soil management and crop \nproduction. \n8  ADB. 2004. Financial Arrangement for a Proposed Global Environment Facility Grant and Asian Development \nBank Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Capacity Building to Combat Land \nDegradation Project. Manila. \n ", "3 \nthe length of seasons, and extreme droughts and floods. To address climate change, the \ngovernment  developed  the  National  Climate  Change  Programme  in  2007.9 The  program \nidentified agriculture and water management as among the key areas that require better policies \nand strategies pertaining to climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, in Qinghai \nProvince, knowledge of climate change\u2019s impact on agriculture and understanding of possible \nmitigation measures remain weak, and few concrete actions have been taken. The project \ndesign explores opportunities to enhance the resilience of agriculture and water development to \nclimate change in the province. \n \n11.  Development coordination. A diverse array of assistance programs from multilateral \nand  bilateral  development  partners  target  agriculture  and  water  resources  in  the  PRC. \nInternational development organizations working in the PRC are committed to supporting the \ngovernment\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010.10 The World Bank is a major supporter of \nirrigated agriculture development and has approved more than 10 relevant investment projects \nin the PRC, including projects that promote PIM, WUAs, and the provision of rural training and \nadvisory  services  for  farmers.  ADB  has  assisted  the  PRC  in  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement, flood and wetland management, environmental and ecosystem protection, and \nsustainable agriculture development. However, external assistance by development partners to \nQinghai Province has been limited, with only a few projects implemented. \n \n12.  Lessons from ADB projects and other development partners\u2019 irrigation and drainage \nprojects include the following: (i) a conducive policy and institutional framework with political \nsupport is essential to improving and sustaining irrigation and PIM; (ii) sustainable O&M with \nuser financing should be pursued; (iii) development and participation of farmers\u2019 organizations \nand farmers are vital elements of irrigation management reform; WUAs should be developed \nearly  in  the  project  cycle,  with  clear  targets  and  continuous  support;  (iv)  efficient  on-farm \nirrigation systems and agronomic measures should be pursued as an integral part of project \ninterventions; (v) an effective interagency coordination mechanism should be in place; and (vi) \ncapacity development for all institutions and stakeholders is essential. These lessons have been \nincorporated in the project design by including PIM and farmers\u2019 empowerment as key project \ninterventions, and establishing and charging a sufficient irrigation service fee (ISF) to cover \nO&M as a loan assurance. \n \n13.  Government policy and ADB\u2019s country strategy. The government\u2019s Eleventh Five-\nYear  Plan,  2006\u20132010  shifted  the  government\u2019s  emphasis  from  economic  growth  toward \nbroader and more inclusive rural and sustainable development in the context of an increasingly \nmarket-oriented economy. To reflect the PRC\u2019s pro-poor economic growth strategy, ADB\u2019s PRC \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010  included  assistance  for  the  rural  poor  to  boost \nproductivity and diversify production through investments in rural infrastructure such as irrigation \nsystems.11  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the project will be increased farmers\u2019 income and reduced poverty in the \ncounties of Hualong, Jianzha, and Xunhua in Qinghai Province. The outcome will be increased \nagricultural productivity and irrigation water use efficiency in the project area.  \n \n                                                \n9  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). 2007. \nChina\u2019s National Climate Change Programme.

The project outputs are (i) climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure, including conversion \nof the existing lift irrigation schemes to gravity irrigation using two existing reservoirs in the area; \n(ii) PIM; (iii) strengthened agricultural service support for productivity increase and climate \nchange adaptation; and (iv) improved project management, as presented below. \n \n16.  Climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure output will include (i) construction of four new \nmain irrigation canals and associated branch and tertiary canals in the north and south of the \nGongboxia and Lijiaxia reservoirs along both banks of the Yellow River, (ii) construction of \n17 new pumping stations to enable irrigation that lies above the main canal alignments, and \n(iii) flow-regulating and measurement structures installed at all branch and lateral canal off-\ntakes. The main canals will include tunnels, inverted siphons, flumes, and open channels. The \nnew  gravity  irrigation  systems  will  serve  about  13,903  ha  of  agricultural  land.  Wherever \npossible, the new gravity irrigation systems will use existing branch and tertiary canals. \n \n17.  PIM intervention will focus on (i) the establishment of 12 model WUAs to develop and \nimplement water delivery schedules and irrigation management systems (including support to \nhelp WUAs develop charters and operating procedures); (ii) support for  establishing a service \ndelivery organization (SDO) in each project county to manage and operate the new inter-\ntownship main canal systems; (iii) increasing the capacity of SDOs and WUAs; (iv) improving \nagreements between SDOs and WUAs for water delivery and equitable ISF payments; (v) \npromoting water conservation measures; and (vi) on-farm water management field trials and \ndemonstrations by model WUAs. \n \n18.  Strengthened agricultural service support will focus on (i) improving agronomic practices \nand the productivity of staple grain crops; (ii) supporting farmers to adopt commercial agriculture \npractices and diversify into higher-value crops; (iii) conducting training workshops for farmers \nand  related  farmers\u2019  professional  associations  (FPAs),  particularly  targeting  ethnic  minority \ngroups and women; and (iv) introducing climate change adaptation measures into farmers\u2019 \nagricultural practices. \n \n19.  The  project  will  improve  farmers\u2019  skills  in  crop  production  by  supporting  the \nestablishment of self-sustaining and self-reliant farmers\u2019 groups, and developing the capacity of \nFPAs  and  WUAs.  Activities  will  include  (i)  field  demonstrations  and  training  programs  in \ncollaboration with FPAs and WUAs, focusing on integrated pest management, on-farm water \nmanagement, and cropping calendar management; and (ii) field tours to the more successful \nfarms in the project area. The project will improve the technical and managerial capacities of \nFPAs and WUAs to facilitate farmers\u2019 access to agricultural inputs and other services, and help \nfarmers to negotiate better deals with providers and enhance their accountability to clients. \nFPAs and WUAs will address gender issues and contribute to increased gender equality. \n \n20.  Improved  project  management  will  help  (i)  strengthen  the  project  implementation \ncapacity of the provincial and county project management offices (PMOs) and of other relevant \nagencies in the provinces and counties; and (ii) improve the overall management of irrigated \nagriculture development by relevant agencies, particularly SDOs and WUAs.  \n ", "5 \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $60  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined following ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the loan and project agreements. The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nThe government will make available the loan proceeds to the Qinghai provincial government \n(QPG), and the QPG will in turn make available the loan proceeds to the county governments \nthrough the prefecture governments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan. The QPG and project county governments will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation risks of the ADB loan.  \n \n23.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB loan will finance 26.8% of the total project \ncosts, including part of the cost of main canal development and equipment as well as the cost of \nPIM, strengthened agricultural service support, and improved project management. The QPG \nwill finance $158.1 million, or 70.7% of the total project cost, including taxes and duties; land \nacquisition and resettlement; environmental management and monitoring; surveys; and design \nand  supervision.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The economic analysis of the project has been undertaken using with- and without-\nproject scenarios following the relevant ADB guidelines. Least-cost analysis was conducted, \nand  the  project  represents  the  least-cost  option  compared  with  alternative  options  of \nrehabilitating the existing lift irrigation schemes. Crop and farm budget data were collected \nthrough a survey of selected households in each township in the project area. The analysis \nindicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall economic internal rate of return \nof about 13.9% and an economic net present value of about CNY208.2 million. The economic \ninternal rates of return of individual subprojects range from 13.1% for Lijiaxia North to 14.3% for \nGongboxia North. Sensitivity analysis shows that the analysis is generally robust. \n  \n26.  The financial sustainability of the project has been analyzed, including assessment of (i) \nincentives for government agencies and irrigation users to participate in the project; (ii) the fiscal \nimpact  of  counterpart  funds  to  finance  project  expenditures  and  loan  repayment;  (iii)  the \nrecovery of O&M costs; and (iv) the potential of institutional arrangements to sustain operation \nof irrigation facilities. The amount of counterpart funding for project implementation will be small \ncompared with the total provincial and project county fiscal revenues, and subsidies provided by \nthe provincial and county governments for O&M will decline significantly if ISF collection is \nimproved. The QPG has committed to provide adequate budgetary support for the project. Local \ngovernment agencies and farmers have demonstrated a strong interest in participating in the \nproject. Farmers will benefit from reliable water supply at much lower cost, and from increased \nincomes as a result of enhanced farm productivity. The ISF to be set under the project will be \nadequate to ensure sustained O&M of irrigation infrastructure and facilities. \n \nB.  Governance \n27.  The financial management assessment shows that the provincial PMO, the Qinghai \nProvincial  Finance  Department,  and  county  finance  bureaus  are  capable  of  carrying  out \nsatisfactory  accounting  and  financial  reporting  for  the  project.  The  offices  of  the  finance \ninspector, key project inspector, and discipline supervisor within these organizations perform \npart of the internal auditor\u2019s function. The procurement capacity assessment indicates that (i) \nestablished arrangements are in place in the PRC and Qinghai Province to handle the various \n ", "8 \nstages of procurement, including preparation of bid documents, tender invitation, bid evaluation, \ncontract  award,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  performance  monitoring;  (ii)  the \nprovincial  and  county  PMOs  have  experience  in  undertaking  domestically  financed  water \nresource  and  irrigation  projects  involving  large  volumes  of  procurement  activities;  and  (iii) \nmonitoring and internal controls regarding procurement are generally in place. In view of limited \nexperience of the PMOs in implementing foreign-funded projects, training on ADB\u2019s procedures \non  financial  management,  procurement,  and  disbursement  will  be  provided  during \nimplementation.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  QPG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  Poverty impact. All three project counties are nationally designated poor counties. It is \nestimated that about 130,000 farmers, mainly from ethnic minorities, will benefit directly from the \nproject.  About  50%  of  the  beneficiaries  are  women,  and  39%  are  poor.  The  project  will \ncontribute to poverty reduction by lowering irrigation costs, improving agricultural productivity, \nand promoting high-value crops through improved water management and technical support. In \naddition, about 13,000 jobs will be created for local residents during project implementation. \n \n30.  Gender and development. A gender analysis was carried out during project preparation \nand the project supports effective gender mainstreaming. Many literate young men and women \nmigrate out of the project area for employment, which explains the high illiteracy\u2014particularly \namong women\u2014among the generally older population that remains. Women, especially in their \n50s and above, tend to stay behind and migrate less, taking more responsibilities in agricultural \nproduction and household chores. Project benefits will be spread at least equally among men \nand women. Gender actions targeting increased benefits and participation for women have \nbeen integrated into the ethnic minority development plans and consolidated in a separate \ngender action plan. The project aims particularly to (i) increase the technical capacity of women \nin agriculture marketing, and (ii) empower women and ensure that they participate in decision \nmaking through membership in WUAs. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment. During project \npreparation,  a  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment  report  and  a  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examination  report  (including  an  environmental  management  plan)  were \nprepared following the PRC regulatory framework, and ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. A due \ndiligence assessment of safety and environmental management for the two existing dams of \nGongboxia and Lijiaxia shows that the operators comply with national regulations and apply \nadequate environmental management procedures acceptable to ADB. \n  \n32.  The project is expected to achieve significant environmental benefits in the project area, \nincluding (i) reduced energy use; (ii) improved water resources management; and (iii) increased \nvegetation coverage. The main possible adverse environmental impacts and risks include (i) \nimpacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  canals,  notably  safety  risks  during  tunnel \nconstruction and disposal of large volumes of spoils; and (ii) potentially, increased usage of \nagrochemicals during operation. It is expected that all impacts will be prevented or minimized to \n ", "9 \nan  acceptable  level  through  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and \nmonitoring program.  \n \n33.  Ethnic minorities. The project is classified as category A. The project will benefit almost \nexclusively poor and near-poor ethnic minority households, improving their economic status and \nlivelihoods  without  negatively  impacting  their  social  security  status.  The  three  main  ethnic \ngroups in the project counties\u2014Hui, Salar, and Tibetan\u2014have inhabited this area for more than \n700 years. They account for 96% of the beneficiaries of the project. There have been no \nrecorded social conflicts in the project area based on ethnicity. There seem to be few, if any, \ndistinct  customs  related  to  agriculture;  but  traditional  decision-making  structures  will  be \nintegrated into the project activities in the villages. Four ethnic minority development plans have \nbeen  prepared  to  mainstream  pro-minority  activities  and  measures  into  the  project  and \nsafeguard the interests of ethnic minorities.  \n \n34.  Land  acquisition  and resettlement. The project is classified as category A. It will \ninvolve 110.8 ha of permanent land acquisition, of which 28 ha (25%) is cultivated land, with \nimpacts spread over 68 villages. The impacts on villages are small because about 75% of the \nland acquired is wasteland. The 28 ha of farmland acquired affects 6,776 persons, and the \naverage degree of loss is about 6%. In addition, 16 households with 101 persons will need to be \nrelocated. The Qinghai Provincial Water Resources Department has prepared two resettlement \nplans. All affected people will be project beneficiaries, as they will receive improved irrigation as \nwell as resettlement entitlements to offset their losses. As compensation, affected households \ncan choose between replacement of irrigated land or cash compensation. A due diligence \nassessment  for  the  associated  Gongboxia  and  Lijiaxia  reservoirs  found  no  outstanding \nresettlement issues.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The project has some potential environmental, institutional, governance, and policy risks. \nThe project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks and verify assumptions for the \nachievement of the project benefits, outcome, and impacts. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.13 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak institutional  Based on capacity assessments, the project provides adequate capacity \ncapacity of the  development programs and consulting services to improve the capacity of \nexecuting and  the executing and implementing agencies in project implementation and \nimplementing agencies  management.  \n WUA sustainability  Extensive stakeholder consultations are a special feature of the project \ndesign. The project has a participatory irrigation management component to \nhelp establish WUAs and empower farmers and WUAs to assume \nresponsibility for operating branch canal and on-farm irrigation systems. \nISF inadequate to cover  Qinghai provincial government has committed to regularly reviewing and \nO&M  adjusting the ISF following national guidelines. The willingness-to-pay \nsurvey has shown that farmers are willing to pay a sufficient ISF to cover \nO&M costs. \nISF = irrigation service fee, O&M = operation and maintenance, WUA = water users association. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n13  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n36.  The government and the QPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37.  The government and the QPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject relating to counterpart financing, irrigation management reform and the ISF, project \nperformance monitoring, resettlement, ethnic minority development, poverty reduction, gender, \nlabor standards, environment, and grievance mechanisms. These covenants are set forth in the \nloan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$60,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Qinghai  Rural  Water  Resources \nManagement Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the loan and project agreements presented to \nthe Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n22 February 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased farmers\u2019  Average farmer income  Provincial and  Government continues to \nincome and  increased from CNY3,000 in  county economic  promote sustainable \nreduced poverty in  2009 to CNY5,000 by 2020  and poverty records  development \nthe counties of  Poverty incidence in the project  and statistics   Provincial and county \nHualong, Jianzha,  area reduced from 39% in 2008    governments maintain \nand Xunhua in  to 25% by 2020  commitment to introduce PIM \nQinghai Province  and joint system management \nOutcome       Assumptions \nIncreased  Spring wheat yield increased  Provincial and  Effective interagency \nagricultural  from 4.6 t/ha in 2009 to 5.7 t/ha  county economic  coordination \nproductivity and  by 2016, and winter wheat yield  and poverty records  Farmers\u2019 willingness and \nirrigation water use  increased from 5.8 t/ha in 2009  and statistics   capability to adopt high-value \nefficiency in the  to 7.2 t/ha by 2016  Project performance  crops  \nproject area  High-value crops diversified on  monitoring and  Counterpart funds are available \nadditional 3,000 ha by 2016  reports by the PMO  on time \nIrrigation water use efficiency  Monitoring and  Risks \nincreased from 35% in 2009 to  evaluation records  ISF too low to cover full O&M \n56% by 2016  costs \n \nWeak institutional capacity of \nthe executing and implementing \nagencies \nWUA sustainability \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
