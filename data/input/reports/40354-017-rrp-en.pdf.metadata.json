Specifically,  the  project  will  design  and  operationalize  new \ncampuses in Hanoi Medical University (HMU) and the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at \nHo  Chi  Minh  City  (UMP).3 It  will  feature  climate-resilient  teaching  and  ancillary  infrastructure, \nhelping the universities to increase undergraduate enrolment and teaching capacity. The project \nwill complement the proposed Local Health Care for Disadvantaged Areas Sector Development \nProgram  through  innovative  models  of  engaging  teaching  institutions  in  community  health, \nincluding the application of information technology-based learning.4 This will enhance the quality \nof  health  care  in  rural  and  underserved  areas  in  response  to  the  population\u2019s  evolving  health \nneeds.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n  \n3. \nDevelopment  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  has  bolstered  the \ncountry\u2019s progress in reducing poverty. Gross domestic product grew by an average of 6.5% per \nyear  from  1991  to  2017.  Gross  domestic  product  per  capita  reached  $2,389  in  2017.  The \npoverty  rate  (i.e.,  the  share  of  the  population  living  on  less  than  $1.90  per  day  in  purchasing \npower  parity)  fell  from  52.9%  in  1992  to  2.0%  in  2016,  while  the  Gini  coefficient  decreased \nslightly from 35.7 to 35.3 over the same period.5 However, poverty incidence varies significantly \nacross regions. Ethnic minorities, who account for 14.5% of the population, make up more than \nhalf  of  the  poor.6 The  government  has  recognized  that  inclusive  growth  and  public  health  are \nintricately linked, as shown by disparities in the key health indicators by region. For example, in \nthe  impoverished  Central  Highlands,  the  infant  mortality  rate  was  24.8  per  1,000 live  births  in \n2015,  while  in  the  affluent  South East region  it was  8.6  per  1,000 live births. Similar  variations \n\n                                                \n1  The proposed project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet \n\nNam, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n\n2  UHC  means  that  all  people  have  access  to  the  health  services  they  need  (prevention,  promotion,  treatment, \nrehabilitation,  and  palliative  care)  without  the  risk  of  financial  hardship  when  paying  for  them.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nare  also  found  in  reproductive  health  and  maternal  mortality  outcomes.7 Disparities  in  health \noutcomes  perpetuate  socio-economic  disadvantage.8 Inclusive  growth  is  further  threatened  by \nthe  growing  financial  burden  associated  with  the  treatment  of  noncommunicable  diseases.9 In \n2015,  the  proportion  of  the  total  disease  burden  attributable  to  noncommunicable  diseases \nreached 73%,10 partly because of Viet Nam\u2019s aging population (footnote 7). Improving access to \nquality  health  services,  particularly  in  poorer  rural  areas,  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  health \noutcomes. \n \nInsufficient number of health professionals. The insufficient number of skilled health \n4. \ncare  professionals  hampers  efforts  to  achieve  UHC.  An  estimated  additional  43,250  doctors, \n249,416  nurses,  and  22,199  pharmacists  are  required  by  2030  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  health \nworkforce  coverage  targets.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  health  education  and  professional  training  institutions \n(HEPTI) produce an insufficient number of professionals to meet these targets. While demand \nfor admission to HEPTI is strong, inadequate infrastructure restricts the capacity of universities \nto  increase  enrolments. This  is most  evident  at HMU  and UMP,  Viet  Nam\u2019s leading  HEPTI.  In \n2017,  only  7%\u20138%  of the  total  applicants for  undergraduate medicine  at  each  university  could \nbe offered places.  \n \n5. \nDeficiencies in skills. Deficiencies in skills compound the adverse effects of the health \nworkforce  shortage,  particularly  in  local  health  care  (LHC).11 Medical  doctors  have  inadequate \nknowledge of clinical guidelines. They ask patients, on average, less than 50% of the required \nquestions about their medical history and conduct less than 60% of the physical examinations \nspecified  in  clinical  guidelines.  Knowledge  of  case  management  protocols  is  also  inadequate, \nwith many doctors prescribing unnecessary and harmful treatments. Half of the medical doctors \nworking in the poorest areas fall in the bottom two quintiles of the national ability scale. These \ndeficiencies  result  in  poor  treatment  quality,  low  service  use,  and  poor  health  outcomes, \nparticularly in disadvantaged areas.12 \n \nTeaching  programs  are  poorly  aligned with population  health  needs.  The Ministry \n6. \nof Health (MOH) has issued competency standards for general medical practitioners.13 However, \nHEPTI  have  been  slow  to  operationalize  these  through  their  curriculum.  HEPTI  require \nassistance  to  transition  the  health  professional  training  programs  from  a  knowledge-based  to \ncompetency-based  curriculum. 14  This  requires  introducing  faculty  development  programs  to \ntrain  educators  in  interactive  teaching  methods  and  clinical  skills  teaching.  Further,  limited \nopportunities for students to  undertake practice in poor and vulnerable communities should be \naddressed as this leaves graduates ill-equipped to work with underserved populations.15  \n                                                \n7  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH).  2017.

Distribution  of  the  health  workforce  is \nskewed,  with  remote  and  mountainous  areas  underserviced.  For  example,  the  Central \nHighlands  has  43  health  workers  per  10,000 people,  while the  Red  River  Delta region  has  71 \nhealth workers per 10,000 people.16 The proportion of commune health stations (CHSs) served \nby a doctor and a midwife or assistant doctor17 is lowest in the Central Highlands and Northern \nMidlands  and  Mountain  regions  (footnote  7).  Higher  health  workforce  density  is  statistically \nassociated with lower infant mortality, and longer life expectancy.18   \n \n8. \nLimited  professional  development  opportunities  in  remote  areas.  A  2015  study \nfound that only 50% of doctors working in district hospitals received some form of training in the \nprevious  12  months.  Among  the  CHS  staff,  the  proportion  who  received  any  training  ranged \nfrom  58%  to  81%,  depending  on  the  province  (footnote  14).  For  health  care  workers  who \nchoose  to  serve  in  remote  areas,  access  to  professional  development  is  limited.  Innovative \ndistance-learning  technologies  can  improve  such  access.  HMU  and  UMP  are  licensed \ncontinuing medical education (CME) providers, but lack access to these new technologies. 19 \n \n9. \nGovernment\u2019s  plan  and  strategy.  The National Action Plan for the Implementation of \nthe  2030  Sustainable  Development  Agenda  confirms  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  ensure \nan  adequate  supply  of  skilled  health  workforce  toward  achieving  UHC. 20  The  government \nprioritizes  the  development  of  health  human  resources  (HHR).21 The  MOH  will  transition  HMU \nand  UMP  into  health  sciences  universities,  capable  of  increasing  graduate  numbers  across \ndisciplines, in line with the country\u2019s evolving health needs. The MOH has undertaken reforms \nto  redress  deficiencies  in  LHC  workforce  quantity  and  quality,  rapidly  increase  the  number  of \ngraduates, and improve training quality.22 It will also redress the imbalance in HHR distribution, \nprioritizing  the  LHC  level. 23  Various  MOH  programs,  including  the  deployment  of  graduate \ndoctors to difficult areas and granting students from disadvantaged locations preferential access \nto HEPTI, have contributed to increasing the health workforce in LHC facilities.24  \n \n10. \nThe  medium-term  development  plans  of  HMU  and  UMP  detail  the  increase  in  student \nintake  required  to  meet  health  workforce  needs. 25 The  MOH  has  prepared  health  sciences \nfacility master plans for HMU and UMP and has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n\n                                                \n16 World Health Organization. 2016.

ADB\u2019s  engagement  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  health \nsector  has  focused  on  improving  the  population\u2019s  access  to  quality  health  services.  During \n1995\u20132005, ADB improved primary health and hospital facilities, service delivery, and the health \nworkforce  in  rural  and  mountainous  provinces. 26  During  2006\u20132016,  it  invested  in  health \nservices  in  remote  areas,27 communicable  disease  control,  and  health  security.28 The  Health \nHuman  Resources  Sector  Development  Program  supported  sector-wide  reforms  in  health \nprofessional  education  and  health  staff  management,  and  strengthened  infrastructure  and \nteaching  capacity  in  17  HEPTI,  including  HMU  and  UMP  (footnote  3).  ADB\u2019s  health  sector \nstrategy supports government efforts toward achieving UHC\u2014use of health services, quality of \nhealth care, and health financial risk protection. It pursues coordinated interventions that focus \non (i) reforms to strengthen the LHC system (footnote 4); (ii) strengthening health care service \ndelivery in selected areas (footnote 27); (iii) developing HHR (footnote 3); (iv) improving health \nsecurity,  including  its  regional  dimensions  (footnote  28);  and  (v)  enhancing  health  financing \nthrough social health insurance.29 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).30  \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n1.

The  Health  Human  Resources  Sector  Development  Program  demonstrated \nthat  for  developing  a  sustainable  high-quality  health  workforce,  strengthening  of  HHR \ninstitutions and systems, and expansion of HEPTI infrastructure are both required (footnote 3). \nTertiary  education  projects  with  infrastructure  components  require  strong  country  ownership, \ndesign  clarity,  and  an  experienced  executing  agency.  Incorporating  these  lessons,  the  project \naligns  with  the  national  HHR  development  strategy  (footnote  22)  and  the  universities\u2019 \ndevelopment  plans  (footnote  25).  The  health  minister  has  already  approved  the  master  plans \nand  basic  architectural  designs  of  both  campuses,  which  will  expedite  project  implementation \nwhile  providing  the  required  design  clarity.  The  executing  agency  is  experienced,  having  a \nproven record of implementing large infrastructure projects.  \n \n13.   ADB  value addition.  ADB synergizes individual health sector investments to maximize \ncumulative  impacts  toward  UHC.  The  proposed  Local  Health  Care  for  Disadvantaged  Areas \nSector Development Program complements the project by strengthening LHC public investment \nmanagement,  improving  the  LHC  service  delivery  model,  and  enhancing  health  workforce \ndevelopment  and  management.  The  project  will  increase  the  supply  of  health  staff  with \nnecessary  skills  to  provide  care  at  LHC  level.  Current  technical  assistance  also  supports \nstrengthening  of  the  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  to  ensure  equitable  access  to  and \naccountability  of  health  financing  (footnote  29).  Based  on  past  and  ongoing  ADB  technical \nassistance,  the  project  design  incorporates  climate-resilient  building  and  features  IT-based \ndistance  learning.31 This  consolidates  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  as  a  provider  of  knowledge  and \ninnovative technology solutions. \n \n14.   Development  coordination.  To  sustain  HHR  improvements,  a  systematic  and  sector-\nwide  approach  is  required  covering  training,  accreditation  and  standards,  and  residency \nprograms  for  new  doctors  and  nurses.  ADB  focuses  on  improving  HHR  training  infrastructure, \ntraining program quality, and HHR management to increase the number, quality and allocation \nof  health  care  practitioners.  The  World  Health  Organization  is  helping  to  introduce  minimum \nqualification  criteria  for  newly  graduated  health  professionals,  including  a  national  licensing \nexam and a national medical council. Several development partners, including the World Bank \nand  the  Partnership  for  Health  Advancement  in  Viet  Nam,  are  updating  curricula  for  medical \neducation  at  both  the  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  level.  The  Partnership  for  Health \nAdvancement  in  Viet  Nam  has  developed  a  3-year  hospital-based  postgraduate  surgical \nresidency  training  program.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  supporting  the \ndevelopment and pilot testing of a standardized clinical training program for nursing graduates.32 \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  UHC,  including  access  to  essential \nhealth  care  services,  achieved.

At project completion, HMU and UMP\u2019s \ncombined  annual  intake  of  undergraduate  students  will  increase  by  2,200,  contributing  1,863 \nadditional health professionals to the workforce annually by 2032. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Competency  of  graduates  to  respond  to  community  health  needs \nstrengthened. The project will (i) conduct assessments of the health needs of women and men \nin  the  35 disadvantaged  rural  and  urban  communes;  (ii)  update  the  curriculum  for  four  key \ndegree programs, focusing on competencies for work at the LHC level;34 (iii) rotate 700 students \nunder  a  pilot  model  of  practice  placements  at  CHSs  servicing  poor  populations;  (iv)  equip  35 \nCHSs  in  pilot  sites;35 and  (v) strengthen  faculty  capacity  in  interactive  teaching  methods  and \nclinical skills teaching. \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Quality  of  health  workforce  in  disadvantaged  communities  enhanced. \nThe project will (i) equip health facilities in four remote districts to support the CME pilot project, \n(ii) develop 40 CME modules covering primary health care topics including modules specific to \nthe health needs of women,36 (iii) pilot test the delivery of distance CME for the health workforce \nin four districts and evaluate the efficacy of the approach, and (iv) apply pilot testing evidence to \ninform replication by HEPTI and registered CME providers.  \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe project is estimated to cost $98.8 million (Table 2). The government has requested \na concessional loan of $80.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of  \n2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and grant agreements. The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will \nfinance  the  expenditures  for  civil  works,  equipment,  and consulting  services.  The  Japan  Fund \nfor  Poverty  Reduction  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $3.0  million.  This  includes \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $0.2  million.  The  grant  will  finance  activities  under  Outputs  2  and  3.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  contribution  of  $15.8  million  includes  taxes,  consulting  services,  resettlement \ncosts,  financing  charges  during  implementation,  and  in-kind  contributions.  Detailed  cost \nestimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM).37 \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n34 HMU  will  review  the  curriculum  for  the  undergraduate  medical  program.
