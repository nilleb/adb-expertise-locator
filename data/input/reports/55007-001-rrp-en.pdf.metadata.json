The  government \nis  negotiating  supply  contracts  with \nmanufacturers of APVAX-eligible vaccines for immediate procurement.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  is  structured  to  provide  the  Government  of  Mongolia  with  immediate  and \nflexible financing to purchase safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX. The \nrapid response component (RRC) will provide financing for direct procurement of APVAX-eligible \nvaccines  from  manufacturers  as  well  as  international  logistics  to  Mongolia.  The  Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will provide joint cofinancing to support the procurement of \nAPVAX-eligible COVID-19 vaccines, in full alignment with the project outcome and ADB\u2019s policies \nand procedures. \n \n3. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030:  \n(i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender \nequality,  (iii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  (iv)  fostering  regional \ncooperation and integration. 2 The project is consistent with the ADB country partnership strategy \nfor  Mongolia,  2017\u20132020 3 as  well  as  the  upcoming  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia, \n2021\u20132024 which aims to help the country recover from COVID-19 and lay resilient foundations \nfor inclusive and sustainable growth.  \n \nin  \n4. \nTable 1. The government has (i) demonstrated an adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,  \n(ii) completed  a  needs  assessment  and a  National  Deployment  and Vaccination  Plan  (NDVP),  \n(iii) prepared an incremental medical waste management plan, (iv) organized direct contracting \nprocurement  arrangements  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines,  (v)  submitted  the  governor\u2019s  letter \nconfirming the government\u2019s commitment to ensure compliance with the APVAX vaccine eligibility \ncriteria, and (vi) established an effective development partner coordination mechanism. \n \n\nfor  accessing  APVAX  as  detailed \n\nthe  criteria  required \n\nMongolia  has  met \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Criteria of Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \n\nAccess Criteria \n1.  Demonstrated adverse \nimpact of the COVID-19 \npandemic \n\nADB Assessment \nCOVID-19 is forecasted to significantly increase the poverty rate from its level of \n28.4% in 2018. Job losses increased to 133,000 in Q1 2021 which is an 11.2% \nreduction  in  total  jobs  compared  to  Q4  2019.  Based  on  historical  experience \nMongolia is vulnerable to economic shocks with the pre-COVID-19 poverty level \nat 28.4% with a further 27.3% living just above the poverty line. A high proportion \nof  people live  in  ger  (Mongolian  traditional  dwelling)  areas  with  poor  access  to \nwater,  sanitation,  and  social  services,  which  increases  their  vulnerability.  The \npandemic  disproportionately  affects  women,  who  comprise  82.0%  of  frontline \nhealth workers.  \n\n \n\n1  The proposed project was prepared under the One ADB approach following streamlined business processes outlined \nin the APVAX policy paper [R195-20], including an abbreviated Board circulation period.

WHO  and  GAVI  have  validated  Mongolia\u2019s  VIRAT  and  VRAF \nassessments to apply for COVAX. \nThe  NDVP  of  Mongolia  prioritizes  frontline  health  workers  and  other  essential \nworkers,  vulnerable and  marginalized  groups,  older  adults,  people  with  chronic \ncomorbidities, people with disabilities, and the homeless. WHO has endorsed the \nNDVP,  which  provides  guidelines  for  the  allocation  of  vaccines  according  to \ninternational  best  practice.  The  plan  also  outlines  timelines,  population  targets, \nprioritization  of  key  populations,  financing  needs,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprocedures,  and  other  measures.  It  builds  on  Mongolia\u2019s  successful  childhood \nimmunization program, which reached 99.4% of the population in 2019. The ADB \nHealth Sector Group has confirmed the status of the NDVP as endorsed by WHO \nand acceptable to ADB. \nMedical  waste  management  is  carried  out  following  standard  procedures \napproved by the joint order of the ministers of health and environment.a ADB has \nsupported  medical  waste  management  systems  in  Mongolia  that  can  support \nmedical  waste  management  for  COVID-19  vaccines.  The  NDVP  addresses \nmedical  waste  arrangements  based  on national  law and  WHO  guidelines.  Due \ndiligence  on  medical  waste  systems  conducted  by  ADB  has  determined \nadherence to safeguard standards. \nOn 26 March 2021, ADB received a governor\u2019s letter confirming the government\u2019s \ncommitment to implement its COVID-19 NDVP and its intent to comply with the \nvaccine eligibility criteria for APVAX. \nThe  government \nlevel \ndevelopment partner coordination mechanism, with the active participation of civil \nsociety groups and key development partners such as ADB, UNICEF, WHO, the \nWorld Bank; and the United Nations resident coordinator.

COVID-19 was first detected in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China in December 2019, prompting the Government of Mongolia to respond immediately to \navoid rapid spread of the disease. The State Emergency Commission of Mongolia instituted strict \nemergency measures by mid-January 2020 that successfully prevented the spread of COVID-19 \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nin Mongolia, and launched the NDVP against COVID-19 on 11 January 2021. 4 These measures \nincluded  international  and  national  travel  restrictions;  non-essential  business  closures;  public \nawareness  campaigns  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  virus;  restrictions  on  public  gatherings, \nmeetings, and celebrations; the closure of schools; and the preparation of hospitals to deal with \nthe  expected  surge  in  COVID-19  cases  and  the  need  for  emergency  care.  The  first  case  of \ncommunity transmission was reported on 11 November 2020, leading to the detection of several \nclusters of local transmission in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, and several aimags (provinces). The \ngovernment immediately implemented three rounds of strict lockdowns from November 2020 to \nmid-April 2021, which helped reduce congestion in aimags and slow the spread of COVID-19 in \nUlaanbaatar. As of 12 May 2021, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported that of the total 46,448 \nCOVID-19 cases, most of the cases (40,830) were in Ulaanbaatar and other cases (5,618) were \nin  aimags.  About  81.2%  (1,678,198)  of  the  target  population  (18  years  old  and  above)  has \nreceived their first vaccine dose and 31.1% (631,666) has received their second vaccine dose. 5 \nThe risk of continued community spread remains substantial, especially in Ulaanbaatar, which is \nthe main national and international travel hub and home to half of Mongolia\u2019s population of 3.3 \nmillion. \n \n6. \nImpact  on  Mongolia\u2019s  economy.  The  impact  of  the  COVID-19  crisis  has  been  more \nsevere  and  prolonged  on the  Mongolian  economy than  initial  expectations  in  2020.  Mongolia\u2019s \neconomy shrank by 5.3% in 2020, a drop of 10.5 percentage points compared with 2019. Official \njob losses reached 63,900 or 5.4% of total employment, and the unemployment rate increased \nby  1.0  percentage  point  to  7.6%  in  the  second  half  of  2020.  Export  shocks  led  to  a  9.4% \ncontraction  in  the  mining  industry,  mainly  because  of  a  decline  in  coal  and  crude  oil  output, \ndragging  down  growth  by  1.9  percentage  points.  Except  for  agriculture,  all  sectors\u2014including \ntransportation,  construction,  trade,  and  services\u2014shrank.  The  overall  budget  deficit  increased \nsignificantly  to  9.6%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2020  because  of  revenue  shortfalls,  fiscal \nresponse  measures  against  COVID-19,  and  the  contraction  in  gross  domestic  product.  The \nbanking industry experienced a credit crunch throughout 2020; and private companies, especially \nmicro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises that  lacked  access  to credit,  faced  severe  liquidity \nshortage issues. \n \n7. \nImpact on poor and vulnerable groups. Although official poverty data for 2020 will be \nreleased in the second half of 2021, it is expected that COVID-19 will significantly increase the \npoverty rate from its level of 28.4% in 2018. This is anticipated given the structure of poverty in \nMongolia, its historical experience, and the recent increase in job losses to 133,000 as of Q1 2021 \nwhich is an 11.2% reduction in total jobs compared to Q4 2019. A further 27.3% of people live \njust above the poverty line and are vulnerable to falling into poverty because of shocks. Mongolia \nhas a history of economic shocks causing large increases in poverty. After a collapse in the growth \nrate to 1.2% in 2016 poverty increased by 8 percentage points to 29.6% from 2014 levels. In 2009 \nthe poverty rate increased by 3.5 points to 38.7% within 12 months when GDP contracted sharply \nby  1.3%. 6  A  high  proportion  of  people  living  in  ger  (Mongolian  movable,  circular  traditional \ndwelling) areas with poor access to health, water, sanitation, and social services are particularly \nvulnerable  to  COVID-19.  Many  ger  areas  are  in  poor  urban  districts  of  cities  that  suffer  from \nenvironmental vulnerability, underemployment, and underinvestment in basic infrastructure.

Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\npoor in rural areas largely depend on herding livestock and farming as their main source of income \nand their nomadic lifestyle requires targeted vaccination plans. \n \n8. \nImpact on gender. Women in Mongolia are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 \npandemic as they comprise 82% of frontline health workers and have a higher risk of exposure, \nillness,  and  death. This  is  exacerbated  by  the  increased  burden  of  unpaid  care  work  at  home \nbecause of the national lockdowns as well as women\u2019s jobs (such as service sector, tourism, and \nhospitality work) being more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19. 7 In addition, the crisis has \nhad  an  adverse  impact  on  gender-based  violence,  as  the  number  of  hotline  calls  and  women \nresorting to shelters has increased significantly since the start of the pandemic. 8 Misinformation \nregarding the effects of vaccines on fertility may increase hesitancy among the female population \nof childbearing age, affecting the expected outcome of reaching herd immunity. \n \n9. \nImpact on the health system. Mongolia\u2019s health sector has made significant progress in \nimproving  health  outcomes  in  recent  years.  The  average  life  expectancy  at  birth  increased  to \n70 years in 2018, up from 69 years in 2016. 9 Mongolia achieved its Millennium Development Goal \ntargets  in  2015  for  maternal  and  child  mortality.  These  hard-earned  gains  are  under  threat \nbecause  of  the  enormous  pressure the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  placing  on  the country\u2019s  health \ncare  system.  As  of  12  May  2021,  2,800,505  polymerase  chain  reaction  tests  have  been \nconducted;  10,531  patients  have  been  hospitalized;  and  73,589  people  have  undergone  strict \nquarantine under medical observation (footnote 5). The increasing number of people hospitalized \nbecause of COVID-19 draws precious health resources away from the treatment of other serious \nillnesses such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, which are the leading causes of \ndeath in  Mongolia.  The  health system\u2019s  limited  human  and fiscal  resources  are  being  used for \ntesting,  extra  remuneration  for  frontline  health  care  workers  and  other  relevant  government \nworkers,  and  preparations for the surge in  COVID-19  infections  and  hospitalizations,  including \nexpensive intensive care capacities. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported that as of September \n2020,  the  government  had  allocated  an  additional  MNT850.0  billion  for  COVID-19-related \nexpenses, including MNT18.3 billion for the health sector. 10 As a whole, health sector expenditure \nincreased by 26% in 2020 compared with 2019. These negative impacts make the rapid rollout of \nsafe and effective COVID-19 vaccines a vital tool that will help Mongolia stop the pandemic. \n \nCOVID-19 National Deployment and Vaccination Plan. The NDVP 11 is an integral part \n10. \nof Mongolia's overall national COVID-19 pandemic prevention and response strategic plan. 12 It is \nbased  on  the  country\u2019s  readiness  assessment,  utilizing  the  Vaccine  Introduction  Readiness \nAssessment  Tool  (VIRAT)  and  the  Vaccine  Readiness  Assessment  Framework  (VRAF) \n\n \n\n7  A time-use survey conducted by ADB in Mongolia among 500 respondents during April and June 2020 found that \n73%  of  the  respondents  indicated  undertaking  more  household  and  care  work.  Female  respondents  spent  an \naverage of 247 minutes on unpaid household work, 2.2 times more than male respondents. ADB.

The NDVP aims to initially vaccinate \n20%  of  the  population  (about  692,342  people),  focusing  on  high  risk  groups  such  as  frontline \nhealth care workers, government workers deployed for the COVID-19 response, and adults aged \n50 and older. This approach is aligned with recommendations from the WHO Strategic Advisory \nGroup of Experts on Immunization. 14 By initially prioritizing these groups, the vaccination program \nwill achieve its impact in reducing the consequences of the pandemic even in conditions of supply \nconstraint. When subsequent consignments of the vaccine become available, up to a total of 60% \nof the population or all the adult population will be vaccinated. The prioritization of target groups \nis  based  on  the  health  risks  of  the  groups  regardless  of  their  tribal,  urban,  rural,  and  pastoral \nresidential identities or the degrees of vulnerability. The NDVP ultimately aims to vaccinate 60% \nof the population free of charge. \n \n\nTable 2: Mongolia\u2019s Target Population for COVID-19 Vaccination \n\nNumber of Target \nPopulation \n56,047 \n52,750 \n\nTarget Population\u2019s \nShare of Total \nPopulation (%) \n1.7 \n1.6 \n \n \n\nTarget Group \n1.

Ulaanbaatar.  \n\n \n\n\faddressed  through  projects  supported  by  the  World  Bank 16 and  the  Government  of  Japan. 17 \nDevelopment  assistance from ADB, the  World Bank, the  Government  of Japan,  UNICEF,  and \nWHO  are  harmonized  through  complementary  activities  aiming  to  implement  the  NDVP. \nVaccination  is  carried  out  at  the  permanent  units  of  the  National  Center  for  Communicable \nDiseases, tertiary hospitals, district hospitals, district health centers, soum (subunit of an aimag) \nhealth  centers  in  rural  provinces,  and  family  health  centers.  Most  of  the  target  population\u2014\nincluding  adults  aged  50  and  above,  people  with  disabilities,  and  vulnerable  people\u2014will  be \nvaccinated  using  a fixed  strategy  (facility-based  approach)  at  the  nearest  health  facility  where \nthey live to ensure that they receive proper care and emergency medical assistance in case of \nadverse  events  following  immunization.  Multidisciplinary  personnel  deployed  in  national  \nCOVID-19  response  measures  are  given  vaccines  using  an  outreach  vaccination  strategy  in \ntemporary  immunization  units.  A  mobile  vaccination  team  is  used  to  cover  hard-to-reach \npopulations  who  reside  in  remote  areas.  Out  of  the  planned  548 immunization  units,  50 \npermanent  immunization  units  have  been  established  in  Ulaanbaatar  City,  where  vaccination \nagainst  COVID-19  began  on  23  February  2021. The  government carried out  a comprehensive \nmapping of all available human resources, including additional staff from the Red Cross, retired \nstaff,  and  preschool  health  staff;  and  developed  a  detailed  list  of  health  workers  who  will  be \nmobilized  in the vaccination  process,  with  an  assigned  role  for  each  worker. Staff  training  has \nbeen planned and will be carried out in phases, covering about 21,000 health care workers and \n17,000 non-health sector workers, including social mobilizers, journalists, and volunteers.  \n \n12. \nJoint working groups have been established to monitor the preparation of temporary and \npermanent  immunization  units  and  vaccine  quality,  safety,  transportation,  and  storage  on  site \nduring  the  immunization  process. 18 In  addition,  the  General Agency for Specialized Inspection \ncarries  out  external  monitoring  of  the  vaccination  process  and  reports  directly  to  the  State \nEmergency Commission. Grievance mechanisms have been established at the General Agency \nfor  Specialized  Inspection,  the  Ulaanbaatar  City  Department  of  Health,  and  the  MOH.  The \ngovernment  has  developed  a  unified  electronic  immunization  registry  of  COVID-19 vaccination \nrecord  with  people\u2019s  vital  information  for  daily  analysis  and  reporting.  An  effective  risk \ncommunication plan has been prepared and implemented. 19 This includes a comprehensive set \nof actions, such as developing information, communication, and training materials for health care \nworkers  and  the  general  population;  training  social  mobilizers  and  influencers  to  provide \ninformation  to  the  public  on  COVID-19  vaccination;  and  conducting  active  surveillance  of  the \npublic attitude during and after vaccination. \n \n13.  Medical waste management. An  increase in  medical  waste  (e.g., syringes, vials,  and \npersonal  protective  equipment  from  vaccinators)  is  anticipated  for  national  COVID-19  vaccine \ndeployment. Medical waste management is carried out following standard procedures approved \n\n \n\n16 On  11  February  2021,  the  World  Bank  approved  $50.7  million  additional  financing  for  Mongolia  supporting  risk \ncommunication; the provision of cold chain equipment and supplies, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, \nand medicines; and the implementation and monitoring and evaluation of vaccination. The World Bank project sets \naside  $18.7  million  for  the  procurement  of  COVID-19  vaccines  through  the  COVID-19  Vaccines  Global  Access \n(COVAX) Advance Market Commitment (AMC) facility, for which procurement is led by UNICEF. World Bank. 2021. \nMongolia COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Project. Washington, DC. \n\n17 In  March  2021,  the  Government  of  Japan  approved  a  $21.5  million  grant  for  Mongolia  that  will  support  the \nprocurement of COVID-19 vaccines and cold chain equipment through UNICEF and will provide capacity building \nactivities for vaccine deployment. \n\n18 Government of Mongolia, MOH. 2021.

In assessments done by WHO and UNICEF \non the successful national childhood immunization program, which had 99.4% coverage in 2019, \nthe  implementation  of  vaccine  medical  waste  management\u2014including  segregation,  storage, \ncollection, treatment, and disposal\u2014was adequately managed. ADB support has been used to \nimprove  the  central  medical  waste  management  facility  in  Ulaanbaatar,  which  can  alleviate \nsudden surges in demand, through the Fifth Health Sector Development Project. 21 Additionally, \ndue diligence assessments 22 conducted by ADB on medical waste management systems found \nthem  to  be  largely  adequate,  with  some  gaps  in capacity  in  aimags  and soums,  particularly  in \nrural areas. These gaps will be addressed through the World Bank COVID-19 emergency project \n(footnote  16)  and  the  proposed  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  grant  linked  to  the \nproject. 23 \n \n14. \nFinancing  needs.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  VIRAT  and  VRAF,  the  Government  of \nMongolia  estimated  an  indicative  financing  need  for  NDVP  implementation  of  $68.5  million\u2013\n$114.0 million, depending on the unit price of vaccines. 24 The World Bank and the Government \nof Japan (footnotes 16 and 17) have committed a total of $72.2 million, of which $34.5 million is \nfor  vaccines.  The  World  Bank  and  the  Government  of  Japan  planned  to  purchase  vaccines \nthrough the  COVID-19  Vaccines  Global Access  (COVAX)  and  UNICEF  at  a  price  of  $7.00  per \ndose. However, according to the current COVID-19 vaccine market dashboard, the unit price for \na  single  dose  of  vaccine  is  much  higher,  ranging  from  $2.06  to  $40.00. 25  Therefore,  the \ngovernment  revised  its  estimated financing  needs  to  $114.0  million  based  on the  approximate \naverage of the COVID-19 vaccines within a higher range of prices ($15.00\u2013$19.50) or $17.00 per \ndose. 26 Given  the  delays  and  limited  access  to  vaccines  through  COVAX,  the  Government  of \nMongolia has requested ADB and AIIB\u2019s assistance to finance the purchase of vaccines through \nbilateral  agreements.  Vaccinating  60%  of  the  population  of  Mongolia  would  require  4,549,676 \ndoses  of  vaccines. 27 As  of  12  May  2021,  the  government  has  managed  to  secure  2,934,940 \ndoses\u2014sufficient to cover 82% of the target population. 28 \n \n15. \nGovernment  and  development  partner  coordination. At  the  national level,  the State \nEmergency  Commission  of  Mongolia  is  a  high-level  commission  responsible  for  the  overall \nnational response to COVID-19 and other emergencies, as well as conducting high-level dialogue \nwith bilateral partners (footnote 4). At the implementation level, the MOH leads the implementation \nof  the  NDVP  and,  through  the  National  Coordination  Committee,  coordinates  the  activities  of \n\n \n\n20 Government  of  Mongolia,  MOH  and  Ministry  of  Environment. 2011.

COVID-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard (accessed 18 May 2021).  \n26 An analysis of the indicative financing needs for the COVID-19 vaccines is in the Country National Vaccine Allocation \n\nPlan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n27 This includes two doses per person, with a 15% wastage rate of vaccines based on WHO guidance. \n28 This  includes  90,540  doses  from  COVAX,  150,000  doses  donated  by  the  Government  of  India;  300,000  doses \ndonated by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2,354,400 purchased by the government (2,300,000 \nSinopharm and 45,000 Sputnik) and 40,000 purchased by the private sector. Under COVAX first round allocations \nthere is a total of 183,540 vaccine earmarked for Mongolia.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndevelopment partners in the health sector. In Mongolia, ADB is the lead development partner in \nthe health sector and is a member of the National Coordination Committee together with the World \nBank, WHO, UNICEF, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. To implement the NDVP, \nthe government seeks additional support from other development partners for its strategy to fully \nvaccinate  60%  of  the  population,  which  will  not  be  covered  by  the  COVAX  Advance  Market \nCommitment (AMC), the World Bank, and the Government of Japan. In particular, the government \nseeks  support  for  direct  procurement  from  the  manufacturers  of  safe  and  effective  COVID-19 \nvaccines to speedily deploy vaccines and avoid forecast delays in delivery through COVAX AMC \nand UNICEF. \n \n16. \nADB  support  for  Mongolia\u2019s  health  sector  and  engagement  in  the  COVID-19 \nresponse and vaccination. The Government of Mongolia and ADB have a long and important \npartnership  in  the  health  sector.  Since  1993,  ADB  has  provided  7  loans,  10  grants,  and \n19 technical assistance projects in Mongolia\u2019s health sector. The government has requested ADB \nto provide support for a rapid response to COVID-19 because of ADB\u2019s significant and impactful \nengagement in the health sector. ADB has responded to Mongolia\u2019s immediate needs for medical \nequipment  and  laboratory  diagnostics  to  detect  and  screen  for  COVID-19  by  repurposing \n$1.4 million in savings under an ongoing loan (footnote 21), which includes an improved medical \nwaste  management  facility;  providing  $2.5 million  in  assistance  from  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster \nResponse  Fund;  mobilizing  small-scale  technical  assistance  of  $225,000;  processing  an \nemergency assistance loan of $30.0 million; and providing a policy-based loan of $100.0 million. 29 \nADB  is currently  processing  a complementary  $5.0  million  grant  proposed  for JFPR  funding  to \nbuild  capacity  for  COVID-19  vaccine  delivery.  ADB  has  also  provided  technical  assistance  of \n$400,000  to  address  and  prevent  domestic  violence  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  through  the \nprovision  of  personal  protective  equipment  and  medical  equipment  for  shelters  and  one-stop \nservice centers enhancing access to emergency services during the crisis. 30 \n \n17. \nAccess  criteria  for  the  Asia  Pacific  Vaccine  Access  Facility.  Mongolia  fulfills  the \ncriteria for accessing the APVAX resource envelope: (i) clear adverse socioeconomic impacts of \nthe  pandemic  in  Mongolia,  as  shown  by  robust  economic  analysis;  (ii) a  needs  assessment \nconducted with support from UNICEF and WHO, using the internationally accepted VIRAT and \nVRAF assessments that served as a basis for the comprehensive national COVID-19 vaccination \nstrategy  and  plan,  which  prioritizes  the  vaccination  of  high  risk  and  vulnerable  groups  of  the \npopulation,  and  reflects  the  management  of  incremental  medical  waste  and  procurement \narrangements;  and  (iii)  strong  leadership  and  coordinated  actions  led  by  the  government  in \nimplementing the national COVID-19 response and the vaccination strategy and plan, including \nthe establishment of effective development partner coordination mechanisms. The government \nhas secured  Mongolia\u2019s  participation  in  COVAX  AMC  and  is coordinating  its  efforts  with ADB, \nUNICEF,  WHO,  and the  World  Bank. To  facilitate  rapid  procurement, the government  plans to \nutilize  retroactive  financing  and/or  advance  contracting  to  speedily  secure  APVAX-eligible \nvaccines (Table 5). \n \n18. \nTo  rapidly  access  COVID-19  vaccines  amid  severely  constrained  global  supplies,  the \ngovernment  intends  to  purchase  COVID-19  vaccines  directly  from  manufacturers.  The \ngovernment has mandated that national (domestic) vaccine authorization or approval for use will \nrely  on  the  emergency  use  listing  by WHO  for  approving  COVID-19 vaccines  or  approval  by  a \n\n \n\n29 ADB.

The Government of Mongolia officially requested ADB\u2019s financial \nsupport  for  securing  safe  and  effective  COVID-19  vaccines  for  the  people  of  Mongolia. 34 The \nprimary objective of the project is to increase the availability of the APVAX-eligible vaccines for \nthe priority population, as defined by the government in its NDVP. The project will be aligned with \nthe  RRC  component  of  APVAX,  including  the  list  of  eligible  items  and  agreed  list  of  eligible \nexpenditures. The  project supports  with the  following  impact: morbidity  and  mortality  of severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reduced. 35 The project will have the following outcome: \npriority population vaccinated against COVID-19. 36 The project will support the implementation of \nthe NDVP and contribute to the government\u2019s efforts to immunize at least 30% of the population, \nwhich represents priority groups. \n \n20. \nOutput. The  output  of  the  project  will be  COVID-19 vaccines for  priority  population  are \nefficiently procured and delivered. The delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines that meet \nAPVAX eligibility criteria, with AIIB cofinancing, will immunize at least 30% of the population. The \nproject will cover eligible expenditure under the RRC pertaining to international transportation of \nthe vaccines from the manufacturers to Mongolia. \n \nC. \n \n21. \n The APVAX project builds on ADB\u2019s health system strengthening assistance to Mongolia \nand  responds  to  Mongolia\u2019s  need  to  address  the  global  emergency  that  is  the  COVID-19 \npandemic. The project contributes to regional public goods 37 through reduction of COVID-19 risks \nto neighboring countries to facilitate safer movement of goods and people and enhanced trade \nand investment. \n \n22. \nThe  government  will  utilize  ADB  financing  for  the  purchase  of  COVID-19  vaccines. \nAddressing essential vaccine rollout pillars will be covered by the government with financial and \ntechnical  support  from  the  World  Bank,  WHO,  UNICEF,  and  the  proposed  ADB-administered \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n31 Government of Mongolia, MOH. 2021.

The  ADB  concessional  loan  of \n$9.5 million for the RRC will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years. The ADB \nregular loan for the RRC will have an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreements.  The  ADB \nconcessional loan for the RRC will have an annual interest rate of 2.0% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. The government has made its own \nindependent  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  in  relation  to  the \nregular and concessional ordinary capital resources loans and has given an undertaking that this \nwas  not made  based  on  any  advice from  ADB.  The AIIB  loan  will  be  partially  administered  by \nADB. It will jointly finance vaccine supply contracts, including logistics and transportation, which \nmeet the eligibility criteria  under APVAX. 39 Its  terms  and conditions  will  be described in  a  loan \nagreement  between  AIIB  and the  government. 40 Approval  of the AIIB loan is  expected shortly \n\n \n\n38 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 The eligibility of vaccines for APVAX financing will adhere to the criteria stated in para. 29 (including footnotes 28, \n29,  and  30)  of  the  APVAX  policy  paper  and  para.  8  (including  footnotes  11  and  12)  of  the  approved  APVAX \namendment paper; (footnotes 1 and 32). \n\n40 AIIB. 2019.

The MOH will provide technical support for the implementation of the \nNDVP  through  the  National  Coordination  Committee,  which  includes  development  partners \nproviding  COVID-19  support.  The  executing  agency  and  these  mechanisms  will  ensure \ncoordination of the project with ADB and other development partners. Vaccines will be purchased \nthrough  direct  procurement  from  the  manufacturer  of  APVAX-eligible  COVID-19  vaccines  to \nspeedily  procure  vaccines  and  avoid  forecast  delays  in  procurement  through  COVAX  and \nUNICEF  because  of  the  severely  restricted  global  supply  of  vaccines.  To  strengthen  project \nreadiness  and  avoid  parallel  project  implementation  arrangements, the  project  implementation \nunit (PIU) responsible for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Health Sector Development projects will be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  this  project. 41  The  implementation  period  will  be  from \nJune 2021  to  December  2023.  Implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM. The procurement of ADB-eligible vaccines will follow the APVAX \npolicy  requirements.  Value  for  money  will  be  achieved  by  securing  multiple  types  of  APVAX-\neligible  vaccines  on  reasonable  commercial  terms  and  through  close  monitoring  of  contract \nimplementation to ensure timely delivery. Retroactive financing arrangements are expected to be \nutilized after loan effectiveness for procurement of vaccines. \n \n\nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\n \n\nJune 2021\u2013December 2023 \n30 June 2023 \n31 December 2023 \n\n1.

DUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nA. \n \nIn Mongolia, COVID-19 has negatively impacted economic activity, including declines in \n27. \ndomestic  consumption,  production,  investment,  trade,  and  tourism,  largely  because  of  the \nstringent  containment  measures  introduced  both  locally  and  globally.  If  allowed  to  continue, \nCOVID-19 will, in the short term, overwhelm the existing health system, which will be unable to \ncope  with  the  simultaneous  burden  of  treatment  of  noncommunicable  diseases  such  as  heart \ndisease, stroke, and cancer, in addition to COVID-19. This will lead to highly negative effects on \nhuman capital development. The immunization of 60% of the population will help achieve herd \nimmunity, save lives, allow the resumption of economic activities, promote trade, and build human \ncapital. Project outputs  are  public  goods  with  no  opportunity  for cost  recovery, so  no financial \nviability assessment is required. The government has estimated an indicative financing need for \nNDVP implementation through the VIRAT and VRAF assessments and has conducted mapping \nof funding sources. 42 \n \nB. \n \n28. \nBased  on  the  financial  management  assessments  of  the  MOH  and  subsequent \nassessments  carried  out  under  the  current  project,  the  MOH  has  adequate  accounting \nprofessionals  as  well  as computerized  financial  accounting  and  reporting systems. Procedures \non the flow of accounting, financial, and project physical progress related to the current project \nactivities are available. All the agencies have clearly defined responsibilities, with accountability \nassigned  to  different  units  at  different  levels  of  authority.  The  MOF  will  oversee  financial \nmanagement, including internal audits and performance audits, of the NDVP following national \nlaws and regulations. The MOH will oversee the management of transport, storage, and security \nof vaccines, following national vaccination program guidelines. \n \n29. \nThe Mongolia National Audit Office will arrange annual audits for the project. The financial \nmanagement assessments concluded that the financial management systems in the MOH meet \ngovernment requirements in terms of staffing, accounting, and internal control. The PIU staff will \n\nGovernance \n\n42 Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nimplement the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy, operation, and procedural requirements. \nThe assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 38). \n \nC. \n \n31. \nPoverty and social. The project will improve emergency preparedness during epidemics \nand pandemics, and health workers\u2019 safety in hospitals in Mongolia. It will directly benefit people \nwho  are  at  high  risk  of  death  from  COVID-19  infection,  and  about  200,000  frontline  workers, \nespecially those  with  professions that  put  them  at  occupational  risk  because  of the  COVID-19 \npandemic.  In  addition,  people  with  disabilities,  people  who  suffer  from  chronic  diseases,  and \nvulnerable groups requiring social assistance will benefit from the vaccine rollout (Table 2). \n \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  some  gender  elements.  Vaccination  with  safe  and \n32. \neffective  COVID-19 vaccines  will  reduce  illness  and  deaths  among  women. Priority  groups for \nvaccination  under  the  NDVP  include  health  care  workers  (82%  of  whom  are  women)  and \neducators (96% of all teachers and workers at preschool education establishments, and 81.2% \nof  basic  teachers  from  the  general  secondary  schools  in  Mongolia,  are  women).  Further, \noperations staff working in 35 shelters and one-stop service centers, which provide a safe haven \nfor victims  of  domestic violence,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  prioritized population  under  the \nproject,  ensuring  accessibility  to  such  services  during  the  crisis.  Data  generated  through  the \nimplementation of the NDVP will be disaggregated by sex, priority group, and occupation for more \neffective targeting of vulnerable groups. Vaccination of the priority population will help reduce the \nburden of women\u2019s unpaid and domestic work resulting from lockdowns, and help reduce gender-\nbased violence at home, which has spiked during the pandemic. Proposed complementary ADB-\nadministered  JFPR  grant  assistance  to  Mongolia  for  supporting  vaccine  delivery  systems  and \ncapacity  building  will  target  women  for  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  training  for \nCOVID-19 vaccine administration (footnote 23). \n \nD. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows. 43 \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category C). The project will procure supplies but will not entail any civil \nworks  or  activities that may cause major  adverse  impacts  on the  environment.  Under  the Fifth \nHealth  Sector  Development  Project  (footnote  21),  medical  waste  management  capacity  has \nincreased,  which  will  contribute  to  medical  waste  management  for  COVID-19  vaccines.  The \nproject will follow national regulations on medical waste. Due diligence assessments conducted \nby ADB on medical waste management systems found them to be largely adequate, with some \ngaps in capacity in aimags and soums, particularly in rural areas (footnote 22). These gaps will \nbe filled by (i) the procurement of autoclaves under the World Bank COVID-19 emergency project \n(footnote  16);  (ii)  training  for  health  workers  on  medical  waste  management  and  occupational \nhealth  and  safety  under  the  proposed  JFPR  grant  linked  to  the  project  (footnote  23);  and \n(iii) monitoring of medical waste, which is also supported through the proposed JFPR grant. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n43 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project \n35. \ncomponents  will  not  involve  civil  works  and  will  not  trigger  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement impacts. The project will not cause adverse or differential impacts on ethnic groups, \nand they will benefit equally from the proposed vaccination of the priority population. \n \nE. \n \n36. \nThe procurement of goods, works, and services will be carried out in a manner consistent \nwith simplified and expedient procedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) and as permitted under APVAX. Since the project will be financed \nunder  APVAX,  ADB  member  country  eligibility  restrictions  will  be  waived  and  universal \nprocurement will apply. ADB will be the lead cofinancier and partially administer the AIIB loan, \nADB Procurement Policy will apply to all procurement. All procurement packages will be jointly \nfinanced by ADB and AIIB. To expedite procurement, both vaccines and international logistics will \nbe  procured  using the  direct contracting method.  Vaccines  will  be  purchased  through  bilateral \nagreements with manufacturers of APVAX-eligible COVID-19 vaccines. The government will be \nresponsible for arranging the transport of the vaccines from the countries of origin to Mongolia. \n \n37. \nA procurement risk assessment was carried out for the project and rated the procurement \nrisk  high.  While the MOH  has  worked  with ADB  for  many years  and  has  implemented several \nADB-financed projects, instances of noncompliance have occurred, including mis-procurement. \nIn addition, the COVID-19 vaccine supply market is severely constrained, with few manufacturers, \nwhile the demand is extremely high. To mitigate these risks, (i) the government should identify \nmultiple sources of vaccine supply to spread risk; (ii) all direct procurements to be funded by ADB \nand  AIIB  (including  candidate  contracts  for  retroactive  financing)  will  be  subject  to  ADB  prior \nreview; (iii) an existing PIU familiar with ADB procurement rules and procedures will be used for \nthis project; and (iv) a vaccine procurement expert will be hired to assist the MOH in procurement, \ncontract negotiation, and implementation. \n \n38. \nValue for money in procurement will be achieved by (i) selecting candidate vaccines that \nare  eligible  for  APVAX  and  best  suited  to  the  domestic  logistics  supply  chain  and  distribution \nfacilities;  (ii)  engaging  with  manufacturers  that  have  advantageous  vaccine  availability  and \ndelivery  timelines;  and  (iii)  entering  into  agreements  with  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nreasonable, bearing in mind the currently constrained market for COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. \n \nF. \n \n39. \nConsidering  the  unpredictable  nature  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  risks  and  mitigation \nmeasures will evolve as the vaccines are rolled out and implementation is monitored. Significant \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  6  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan. 44 \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 6: Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nDelays in the delivery of vaccines \nbecause of the high global demand \nand manufacturing bottlenecks \n\nThe  government  will  use  bilateral  arrangements \nto  secure  direct \nprocurement  of  APVAX-eligible  vaccines  from  several  manufacturers. \nAdditional  vaccines  could  be  procured  through  the  COVAX  AMC  as \nMongolia has secured its participation.  \n\n44 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nRisks \nDelays with the EUL of vaccines by \nWHO, which is a consideration of \nthe government and one of the first \ncriteria for APVAX eligibility  \nDifficulties with the airfreight \nshipment of vaccines from the site of \nmanufacturers to Ulaanbaatar  \nDifficulties with ensuring the storage \nof vaccines with super-cold freeze \nrequirements  \n\nLack of population enrollment \nbecause of vaccine hesitancy, \ndoubts over safety and \neffectiveness, and negative attitude \ntoward immunization  \nChallenges to control corruption \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nVaccines that the government is negotiating to purchase through bilateral \narrangements and the COVAX AMC are already listed on the WHO EUL \nand approved by the national Human Medicine Council or being assessed \nand soon to be included in the WHO EUL. \nThe government will use MIAT Mongolian airlines for airfreight shipment of \nvaccines.
