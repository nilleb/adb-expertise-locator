The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant, and \n(ii)  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA),  both  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom  for  Supporting  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Investments  in \nSindh  Province,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the grant and the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  Sindh  (GOS),  through  the  Government  of  Pakistan,  has  requested \nthe  assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \ninvestments and services in Sindh. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAfter experiencing economic growth with a compound annual growth rate of 5.1% during \n2001\u20132007, Pakistan witnessed a significant decline during 2008\u20132015. During this period the \ncompound  annual  growth  rate  was  3.8%,  characterized  by  a  challenging  investment  climate, \npolitical instability, weak but recently improving fiscal discipline, weak public sector governance, \nand an unresolved energy crisis. Despite a modern banking system, Pakistan\u2019s financial service \nintermediation is low and deteriorating. The ratio of credit to the private sector to gross domestic \nproduct  declined  from  28%  in  2007  to  15%  in  2015,  indicating  the  massive  public  sector \nborrowing that undermines private access to affordable credit. Financial inclusion remains very \nlow and access to credit is worsening, with only 3% of the adult population having loan accounts \nand 30% having deposit accounts.2  \n \n4. \nWith 44 million inhabitants (23% of Pakistan\u2019s population) and a gross domestic product \nshare  of  32%,  Sindh  has  large  infrastructure  and  social  service  needs,  and  these  exceed  the \nprovincial  public  resources  available. 3  With  limited  sources  of  revenue,  federal  transfers \nconstituted  79%  of  Sindh\u2019s  budget  in  2016.  Only  PRs225  billion  or  25%  of  Sindh\u2019s  annual \nbudget  was  allocated  to  the  annual  development  plan  (ADP)  in  FY2017,  which  funds \ninfrastructure  investments.  The  World  Bank  estimates  that  Sindh\u2019s  annual  infrastructure \ninvestments  only  represent  up to  4%  of  the  requirements  in  transport,  electricity,  water  supply \nand  sanitation,  solid  waste,  telecommunication,  and  irrigation.  In  addition,  Sindh  requires \ninvestments in health and education. This also highlights the inability of the GOS to effectively \nutilize  its  budget  for  meeting  its  infrastructure  needs  via  public  procurements.  To  meet  the \nneeds  of  infrastructure  in  the  province,  such  investments  must  be  augmented  by  stronger \nprivate participation. In addition to bridging the funding gap for infrastructure investments, PPPs \nmay  also  help  accelerate  completion  and  improve  operating  efficiency.  However,  PPPs  carry \nsignificant fiscal risks that need to be managed and mitigated. \n \nTo reduce the infrastructure gap in the context of extremely limited fiscal resources, the \n5. \nGOS began facilitating PPP investments by promulgating the Sindh Public Private Partnerships \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund.

Pakistan  Business  Review \n\n(October). No official estimates of provincial gross product are available for Sindh. \n\n\fAct  2010,4 along  with  legislation  guidelines  and  procurement  rules  and  public  financing.  The \nPPP  Policy  Board,  led  by  the  chief  minister,  was  established  to  approve  PPPs.  A  PPP  unit \nwithin  the  Sindh  Finance  Department  (SFD)  helps  line  departments  identify  and  develop \nsuitable  PPPs.  A  project  development facility  (PDF) to  support the  use of transaction  advisory \nservices  and  a  viability  gap  fund  (VGF)  for  the  public  financing  portion  of  PPPs  were  also \nestablished  in  2010.  As  of  September  2016,  Sindh  had  funded  five  PPP  investments  that \ncommenced operation in 2013\u20132015. A pipeline of projects has been identified by the GOS; 36 \nprojects have passed concept approval, with an estimated cost of PRs240 billion.5 \n \n6. \nHowever,  initial  experience  demonstrates  that  considerable  efforts  are  required  to \nimprove the leverage of public financing with private capital, improve governance and financing \npolicies, and minimize fiscal risks related to PPPs. As PPP investments and contingent liabilities \ngrow, it is essential to better prioritize project selection, and follow this with proper structuring to \nminimize fiscal risks. As a first step, PPP project identification and selection has to initiate from \nthe  line  department  when  it  is  evaluating  the  requirement  for  ADP  funds.  Government \ndepartments  should  carefully  consider  project  revenue  generation  and  identify  potential  risks \nand the corresponding mitigation actions. \n \n7. \nAlthough  the  VGF  is  mandated  to  support  affordability  for  infrastructure  services  while \nensuring commercial viability of PPP investments, it has so far been used for different purposes \nby  providing  (i)  funding  to  investments  through  government  equity,  subordinated  loans,  and \nloans  to  PPPs;  and  (ii)  full  cash  collateral  to  back  GOS  revenue  guarantees  and  annuity \npayments to bank debt and equity sponsors. While such purposes appeared to address Sindh\u2019s \nlow creditworthiness, the initial PPP projects were not properly structured and executed, which \nled to (i) high fiscal cost and contingent liabilities that undermined the benefits of PPPs; and (ii) \nprivate  concessionaires  and  banks  being  favored,  with  PRs22  billion  of  public  funding  being \nused for only eight PPP projects signed during 2011\u25002016. The use of public resources for PPP \nprojects must be limited to ensure appropriate separation of commercial risk to be borne by the \nprivate  party  from  political  and  regulatory  risks  to  be  borne  by  the  government.  Government \nsupport through a VGF should only be deployed to provide sufficient funding for the commercial \nviability  of  the  PPP  and  not  be  excessive  and  favor  private  participants  and  banks.  Prudent \nmanagement  of  fiscal  risks  and  contingent  liabilities  must  be  put  in  place  to  limit  fiscal  risks \nwithin well-defined limits. \n \n8. \nThe  structure  of  Sindh\u2019s  PPPs  must  be  significantly  improved  through  (i)  robust  policy \nthat guides the selection of eligible viable PPP projects based on Sindh\u2019s ADP, (ii) equitable risk \nparticipation from investors and lenders, (iii) rigorous risk management policies and supporting \nsystems that address project and related fiscal risks, and (iv) sound policies that guide the use \nof public funding.  \n \nThe  project  will  support  the  development  policies  of  the  GOS  for  sustainable \n9. \ninfrastructure  provision  through  PPPs. 6 It  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  midterm  review  of  Strategy \n2020,7 in  which  PPPs  are  a  key  driver  of  change,  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n\n                                                 \n4  Government of Sindh. 2010.

In  this  process,  the  capacity  of  the  PPP  unit  and  PPP  nodes  in  government \ndepartments  will  be  improved  so  they  are  able  to  identify  financially  viable  PPP  projects  and \nrigorously  assess  unsolicited  proposals. This  output  will  strengthen  the  technical  skills  needed \nto  select  and  develop  PPP  projects,  financial  management,  transparent  procurement,  and \nsound  regular  financial  reporting  and  external  auditing. Well-qualified  professional  staff  will  be \nable  to  evaluate  prefeasibility  studies  and  structure  transactions  with  the  assistance  of \ntransaction advisors. \n \n13. \nThe PDF was established in 2010 and the Guidelines for PDF Utilization were issued in \n2011.  The  PDF  is  a  pool  of  funds  available  for  engaging  consulting  services  to  assist  in \npreparing  and  structuring  target  PPP  projects.  The  PPP  Policy  Board  approves  the  utilization \nand  disbursements  of  the  PDF  at  the  request  of  line  departments;  such  requests  are  routed \nthrough the PPP unit. Funds are managed by the Sindh Fund Management House, which is a \nunit of the SFD. The guidelines to identify and select viable PPP projects will be further refined \nto provide additional guidance to line departments, the PDD, and the PPP unit in identifying and \nprioritizing  PPP  projects  consistent  with  the  ADP  in  forecasting  demand  for  provincial  PPP \nprojects in electricity, transport, water supply, and sanitation infrastructure. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2015.

They will provide advice to make target \nPPP projects commercially viable and bankable. VFM will include public sector comparators that \nestimate  the  life  cycle  cost  of  a  project  delivered  by  a  public  sector  agency  to  properly \nbenchmark  PPPs.  The  VFM  assessment  compares  the  estimated  project  cost,  including \nestimated operational efficiency gains provided by a private concessionaire. \n \n15. \nProject  selection  criteria  and  monitoring  will  be  rigorously  applied  as  described  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM). 12 Technical,  financial,  and  economic  analyses  will  be \nundertaken to ensure the viability of the proposed projects. For large PPP projects,13 transaction \nadvisors  will  assist  in  drafting  and  managing  requests  for  proposals  to  ensure  responsive \nbidding.  The  PPP  unit  will  assess  the  capability  of  private  sponsors  and  lenders  to  provide \nfinancing  and  services, as  well  as  establish  an environmental  and  social  management system \n(ESMS) to determine, mitigate, and manage environmental and social impacts of PPP projects \nas a basis for recommending projects for consideration by the PPP Policy Board. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Fiscal  Risk  Effectively  Managed  by \nthe Public\u2013Private Partnership Support Facility  \n\n \n16. \nThis output will establish policies and procedures as well as systems for identifying the \nappropriate use and level of support by the VGF to avoid the excessive use of public funds, and \neffectively  manage  the  contingent  liabilities  arising  from  PPP  projects.  The  PSF  will  be \nestablished under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 as a not-for-profit company to \nmanage  the  new  VGF,  thereby  enhancing corporate governance  and  transparency  of the  new \nVGF. Loan and grant proceeds and government counterpart funding will be channeled through \nthe PSF.14 \n \n17. \nUnder the project, the exposure of the existing VGF will be separated from the proposed \nnew VGF. The PSF will ensure that the new VGF funded under this project will enhance service \naffordability and VFM as determined by policies and standard operating procedures that support \nsocially  and  economically  viable  projects  and  improve  their  commercial  viability  within  well-\ndefined fiscal risk limits. The new VGF may provide upfront capital investment and guarantees \nto partially offset cost and risks during the construction period and reduce noncommercial risks \nfor  public  service  investments  related  to  land  acquisition.  The  new  VGF  may  also  be  used  to \naugment  user  fee  revenue  to  be  collected  by  a  private  concessionaire  or  to  provide  equity, \nquasi-equity, or subordinated debt and guarantees to a PPP. \n \n18. \nThe  PSF  will  have  strong  corporate  governance,  including  requirements  for  regular \ninternal and external audits. The facility will have a board of directors composed of at least five \nmembers,  of  which  at  least  three  will  be  independent  members  not  affiliated  with  the \ngovernment  and  equipped  with  relevant  professional  experience.  The  board  of  directors  will \nelect  an  independent  director  as  its  chair. The  principal  managers  of the  company  will  include \nthe chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief risk officer. The principal manager will \nbe  an  experienced  professional  with  relevant  private  sector  experience  and  will  be  recruited \nthrough  a  transparent  and  competitive  process.  The  PSF  will  recruit  staff  with  the  skills  and \nexpertise needed to determine the appropriate level and use of VGF funding for proposed PPP \nprojects, and to manage its execution by supervising and monitoring the performance of PPPs \n\n                                                 \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 The GOS defines infrastructure projects of over $5 million as large projects. \n14 Footnote 12, Section III. \n\n\f5 \n\nsupported  by  the  new  VGF.  PPPs  approved  for  funding  by  the  PSF  will  require  ADB\u2019s  prior \nconsent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Such consent may subsequently be replaced \nby  a  free  limit  when  ADB  is  satisfied  with  the  successful  execution  of  at  least  three  approved \nprojects by PSF. \n \n19. \nThe  PSF  will  ensure  the  VFM  of  PPPs  and  effectively  manage  fiscal  risks  by  (i) \nimproving  its  selection  of  projects  and  risk  management  by  recommending  appropriate \nstructures and risk participation, and (ii) minimizing cash collateralization practice. The PSF will \nalso provide (i) early participation and feedback on PPP selection, (ii) possible funding that the \nVGF may support, and (iii) periodic reports on the contracted and contingent liabilities related to \nPPP projects funded by the new VGF. \n \nThe  PSF  will  manage  the  utilization  of  the  new  VGF.  The  new  VGF  will  be  funded  by \n20. \ngovernment  counterpart  funds,  a  grant  from  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the \nADB  loan  upon  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction  that  policies  and  procedures  and  staffing  of  the  PSF  are  in \nplace and comply with the covenants set forth in the loan and project agreements and the PAM. \nThe PSF will also report quarterly to the PPP Policy Board, ADB, and the project management \nunit (PMU) in the SFD, which will prepare quarterly consolidated project progress reports.15 The \nPSF will also assist the GOS in monitoring existing VGF and contingent liabilities. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput  3:  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Project  Selection  and  Subsequent \nManagement  Capacity  of  Line  Departments,  Finance,  and  Planning  and \nDevelopment Departments Strengthened \n\n \nThis output will build capacities in the SFD, PDD, PPP unit, and the PPP nodes of line \n21. \ndepartments  to  effectively  perform  their  duties.  The  GOS  is  currently  unable  to  manage  the \nfiscal  risk  of  PPP  projects.  The  SFD  will  engage  two  risk  management  specialists  who  will \nassess  the  fiscal  risks  of  PPP  projects,  measure  contingent  liabilities,  propose  appropriate \nallocations  of  risk  between  public  and  private  partners,  and  provide  effective  independent  risk \nadvice  until  the  PSF  is  formed.  Once  constituted,  the  PSF  will  apply  similar  effective  and \nenhanced  risk  management  practices  in  relation  to  the  management  of  the  new  VGF.  The \nspecialists  will  assist the  PPP  unit  and GOS  to  assess the risks  associated  with  PPP  projects \nand  develop  recommendations  for  managing  those  risks.  They  will  monitor  adherence  to  the \nbudget  allocation  of  the  GOS  and  assist  the  government  in  formulating  and  embedding  risk \ntolerance strategies into budgetary planning processes. To avoid duplication of efforts, the two \nrisk management specialists will be transferred to the PSF after it is constituted to carry out the \nsame role in close coordination with the PPP unit. \n \n22. \nThe  lack  of  experienced  staff  in  the  PPP  nodes  to  process  PPP  transactions  is  a \nsignificant  constraint  on  developing  PPPs.  Support  will  be  required  to  build  skills  for  (i) \nmanaging PPP contracts and environmental and social safeguards; (ii) understanding relevant \nlegal  issues,  and  preparing  loan  documentation  and  requests  for  proposals  and  concession \nagreements; (iii) developing financial expertise to structure transactions; and (iv) assessing and \nmanaging  the  market  and  operational  risks.  Under  the  project,  the  SFD  will  implement  a \ncomprehensive PPP capacity building plan. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 The PMU will facilitate VGF reimbursements from the project proceeds through the withdrawal application process. \nA  detailed  fund  and  document  flow  diagram  is  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  and  the  attached  TA  will  support  (i)  on-the-job  and  modular  training  on \n23. \nalternative  financing  plans  and  credit  enhancement  products,  including  means  of  leveraging \ninvestment funds for PPPs from international, regional, and local syndicated banks; export credit \nagencies; and capital markets; and (ii) promotion of a culture of periodic, in-depth consultations \nwith local commercial banks and international financial institutions and multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners active in project financing. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe  total  project  cost  as  detailed  in  the  PAM  is  estimated  at  $184.2  million  equivalent \n(Table 1) and includes funding by the GOS and ADB, and grant cofinancing by the Government \nof  the  United  Kingdom  through  the  Department  for  International  Development,  to  be \nadministered by ADB (Table 2). \n  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Summary \n\nAmount ($ million)a \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\nItem \nA.

The  GOS  lacks  the  revenues  and \nborrowing  capacity  to  fund  Sindh\u2019s  infrastructure  needs.  PPPs  offer  opportunities  to  close  the \ninfrastructure gap. \n \n Based  on  its  due  diligence  and  lessons  learned  from  its  previous  support  for  Sindh \n30. \nPPPs, ADB estimated that the project may leverage an additional amount of private capital, over \n5  years,  that  equals  the  public  project  cost  of  about  $160  million  to  construct  and  operate \ninfrastructure  projects  in  Sindh,  and  will  thereby  stimulate  economic  activity  and  income  and \nemployment  in  Sindh.  Major  expected  benefits  are  the  creation  and  development  of  critical \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  on-time  delivery  and  lower  cost  overruns  compared  with  public \nprocurement.20 An ADB financial management assessment considered the capacity of the SFD \nto be adequate, taking into account the risk mitigation measures described in para. 31. \n \nB. \n \n31. \nThe  financial  management  risk  rating,  before  risk  mitigation  measures,  is  considered \nsubstantial.  The  governance  and  operational  policies  and  procedures  in  the  existing  VGF  are \ninadequate.  The  SFD  has  agreed  to  improve  oversight  of  the  PDF  and  existing  VGF  through \nperiodical  external  audits.  Under  the  project,  a  new  well-structured  and  established  PSF  will \nmanage  the  new  VGF  in  compliance  with  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan \ngovernance,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing  requirements.  The  following  aspects  must  be \nimproved prior to the first disbursement: (i) accounting and reporting systems for the PDF and \nnew  VGF  must  be  confirmed  satisfactory  to  ADB;  and  (ii)  contingent  liabilities  related  to  PPP \ncontracts must be adequately reflected in GOS financial statements and gaps identified in GOS \nfinancial  audits  beginning  with  the  audit  of  FY2016,  and  be  addressed  through  a  time-bound \naction  plan  no  later  than  30  June  2017.  Under  the  project,  new  VGF  injections  will  be  routed \nthrough  the  PSF,  which  will  manage  the  funds.  PSF  staff,  proficient  in  risk  management,  will \ninstitute  a  strong  governance  structure  and  support  the  SFD  in  managing  the  contingent \nliabilities arising from PPPs. \n \n32. \nThe  SFD  procurement  team  possesses  adequate  skills,  experience,  and  capacity  to \nprocure  goods  and  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  Sindh  Public  Procurement  Rules \n2010. The team\u2019s capacity to follow ADB guidelines will continue to be strengthened. The GOS \nhas  drafted  procurement  procedures  for  efficient  and  transparent  procurement  processes  for \nPPP  projects.  Processes  for  information  management,  effectiveness,  and  accountability \nmeasures  are  satisfactory.  The  PMU  will  include  dedicated  staff  to  handle  procurement \n\n                                                 \n19 Exchange rate on 11 August 2016. \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\noversight  and  document  flow.

ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the \nGOS. The specific policy requirements and risk mitigation measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 11). \n \nC. \n \nThe project is classified general intervention. It will, however, generate indirect benefits \n33. \nthrough  increased  and  improved  infrastructure  and  services  and  may  provide  fiscal  space  for \nsocial  expenditures  in  the  long  term  when  PPPs  are  more  established.  The  project  will  help \nimplement  PPPs  that  reflect  appropriate  VFM,  resulting  in  a  net  gain  for  the  people  of  Sindh. \nThis will benefit both urban and rural areas by increasing employment opportunities during PPP \nproject  construction  as  well  as  establishing  ancillary  facilities  that  will  generate  additional \nemployment.  Through  the  TA,  the  project  will  further  support  training  on  gender-responsive \nproject  selection  criteria  (i.e.,  impact  on  women  beneficiaries,  mitigation  measures  for  any \nadverse  impact  on  women,  employment  opportunities  that  will  be  created  for  women  through \nthe project, and capture of sex-disaggregated project data). \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe  project  is  classified  financial  intermediation  for  the  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  financial  intermediation  treated  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Due \ndiligence shows that the PSF will support infrastructure initiatives that may have resettlement and \nenvironmental  impacts.  Civil  works  will  include  new  construction,  as  well  as  rehabilitation  of \nexisting  infrastructure  in  areas  such  as  transport  and  renewable  energy.  No  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples are  anticipated. An  ESMS arrangement document setting out the safeguard \nrequirements has been prepared. Prior to the first disbursement to the PSF, an ESMS that meets \nADB\u2019s  requirements  must  be  in  place.  ADB  will  also  need  to  be  satisfied  that  the  PSF  has  the \naccountability and capability to (i) manage the ESMS and environmental and social policies of the \nPSF and the PPP unit, and operational guidelines, safeguards screening, categorization, review \nprocedures, and oversight during subproject implementation; and (ii) set out a plan to strengthen \nthe environmental and social safeguards capability of the PSF and PPP unit through appropriate \nintegration  in  the  PSF  risk  management  structure,  and  appropriate  staffing,  performance \nmonitoring, and reporting. TA consultants will support the PSF in establishing the ESMS, and will \nperiodically monitor and review ESMS implementation. The PSF will also contract the services of \na firm on a retainer basis to assist it with the safeguards reviews of any proposals submitted for \nfunding,  and  to  support  its  accountability  for  managing  the  ESMS  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  Disclosure  of  subproject  safeguards  documents  are  described  in  the \nESMS. The ESMS will be subject to periodical external audit and review by ADB.21 \n \nE. \n \n35. \nOverall  project  risks  are  assessed  as  high.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.22 The integrated benefits and positive impact of the project are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                 \n21 An  environmental  and  social  safeguards  management  system  will  be  established  to  ensure  that  appropriate \n\nsafeguards are incorporated in Sindh\u2019s PPP activities. \n\n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPoor security environment affects \ninvestor confidence. \nPPP policy project selection criteria \nmay not be used by all PPP nodes \nHigh turnover of critical staff in the \nPPP nodes creates a risk of project \nimplementation delays and inability \nto deliver projects. \nPrudent policies and procedures for \nVGF funding are not consistently \napplied. \n\nVGF is not properly utilized. \n\nMitigating Measures \nDirect mitigation of the political and security risks are outside the scope of this \nproject. \nThe Asian Development Bank will disqualify projects that do not apply policies \nand guidelines consistently. \nThe technical assistance will help develop a document management system, \nhandbooks, and guidelines that will be used to train and transfer knowledge to \nnew staff. \n\nThe project development facility will be regularly audited.
