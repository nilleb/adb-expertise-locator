If approved, this will be the first loan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to receive \nrisk participation by a third party financial institution. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nPLL  owns  and  operates  India\u2019s  first  LNG  import  and  regasification  terminal,  located  in \nDahej,  Gujarat.  The  terminal  was  built  with  first  phase  capacity  of  5  million  metric  tons  per \nannum (MMTPA) with the intention of expanding to 10 MMTPA in the second phase. PLL also \nplans to construct another LNG terminal in Kochi, Kerala. \n \n3. \nPLL  is  a  product  of  ADB\u2019s  advisory  work  with  the  Government  of  India  from  its  public \nsector window. In 1997 ADB provided a Japan Special Fund-financed technical assistance1 for \na  study  on  setting  up  a  public-private  joint  venture  to  build  and  operate  LNG  terminals.  The \ntechnical assistance completion report2 states that the LNG terminal project could be funded in \npart under ADB\u2019s private sector window. The concept to set up a public-private joint venture for \nLNG  terminals  was  later  incorporated  in  the  Hydrocarbon  Vision  2025,  the  Government \nframework for energy development. \n  \n4. \nBased  on  the  study  and  framework,  four  leading  state  companies\u2014Bharat  Petroleum \nCorporation Limited (BPCL), GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC), \nand Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC)\u2014formed PLL to implement the first LNG \nterminal in the country. Throughout this process, ADB maintained dialogue with the Government \nand  the  four  project  promoters  and  helped  make  the  project  commercially  viable.  After \nincorporating  ADB\u2019s  advice  on  the  project  structure,  including  50:50  joint  public-private  sector \nownership  and  gas  pricing,  in  2002  the  four  companies  reconfirmed  their  desire  to  have  ADB \nfinancial assistance.  \n \n5. \nIn  response,  on  13  January  2004,  the  ADB  Board  approved  an  equity  investment  and \nPCG  amounting,  in  exposure  terms,  to  Rs3.525  billion  (equivalent  to  $75  million  at  the \nexchange rate of that time) to finance the first phase of PLL\u2019s Dahej terminal. ADB subscribed to \n5.2%  equity  of  PLL.  The  terminal  started  commercial  operation  on  9  April  2004  and  its \nproduction reached full capacity of 5 MMTPA in March 2005. \n \n6. \nThe terminal was financed with equity and debt. The entire debt requirement was met by \nloans  from  Indian  banks  that  carry  floating  interest  rates.  It  was  intended  that  after  the \ncommencement of commercial operation, PLL would replace part of the Indian bank loans with \na  bond  issue  partially  guaranteed  by  ADB.  The  bonds  would  provide  long-term,  fixed  interest \nrate  funds,  which  are  not  available  in  India.  ADB\u2019s  PCG  would  upgrade  PLL\u2019s  credit  rating, \nmaking its bond issue possible and helping stabilize the project\u2019s economics.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to India for the Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal Project. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance Completion Report on the LNG Terminal Project in India. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever,  PLL  did  not  proceed  with  a  bond  issue  due  to  changes  in  the  bond  market \n7. \nconditions since PLL and ADB started negotiating the PCG.  Under the new market conditions, \na bond issue would not provide PLL with a low enough interest rate.  \n \nAs  the  expansion  of  the  Dahej  terminal  became  imminent,  PLL  decided  to  keep  the \n8. \nexisting debt arrangement for the first phase terminal and not pursue a bond issue to refinance \npart of the existing loans. PLL still asked ADB to provide finance for the Dahej expansion and to \ndo so in collaboration with KfW, which had expressed strong interest in financing PLL, but only \nin association with ADB. After obtaining concept clearance for the Dahej expansion project on \n16 August 2005 and cancelling the board approval for the PCG on 26 August 2005, ADB fielded \na due diligence mission in March 2006. \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nThe Gas Sector  \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply \n\nIndia\u2019s primary energy consumption stood at 3.7% of the world\u2019s total in 2004.3 India is \n9. \nnow  the  fifth  largest  consumer  of  primary  energy  in  the  world.  However,  per  capita  supply  of \nenergy is still low, even  among Asian developing countries. In 2003, compared with the world \ntotal primary energy supply per capita of 1.69 tons of oil equivalent, India recorded only 0.52,4 \nreflecting the strong potential for continuing growth in the Indian energy sector.  \n \nThe predominant source of primary energy continues to be coal (54.5%), followed by oil \n10. \n(31.7%), natural gas (7.7%), hydro (5.1%), and nuclear (1.0%). Recent environmental concerns \nas well as spiraling oil prices have boosted natural gas as a source of energy. While the share \nof natural gas is much lower than the world average of 23.7%,5 growth has been faster than for \nany other fuel. From only 16.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) (equivalent to 45 million standard cubic \nmeters  per  day  [MMSCMD])  in  1994,  natural  gas  use  was  nearly  29.4  bcm  (81  MMSCMD)  in \n2004. The share of natural gas is expected to increase from 8% to 15% by 2011\u20132012 and to \n20% by 2024\u20132025, provided that gas is made available from domestic and imported sources.  \n \n11. \nIndia\u2019s natural gas demand was met by domestically produced gas, but with the start-up \nof PLL in April 2004, India started importing gas. Most domestic gas production currently takes \nplace  in  the  Bombay  high  fields  and  Gujarat.  State-owned  ONGC  and  Oil  India  Limited  still \ndominate gas production (79%), with joint ventures and private sector companies accounting for \nthe rest. In the mid-1990s, domestic production was deemed to have peaked and was forecast \nto  decrease  as  low  as  36  MMSCMD  by  2025.  However,  major  new  gas  fields  have  been \ndiscovered since 2000, most notably Reliance Industries\u2019 KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari \nBasin offshore of Andhra Pradesh, with an estimated 400 bcm reserves. With such discoveries, \n                                                 \n3  BP  plc.  2005.  BP  Statistical  Review  of  World  Energy  2005.  Available:  http://www.bp.com/liveassets \n/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/publications/energy_reviews_2005/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/p\ndf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2005.pdf.  Primary  energy  refers  to  commercially  traded  fuels. \nFuels  such  as  wood,  peat,  and  animal  waste,  which  though  important  in  many  countries,  are  unreliably \ndocumented in terms of consumption statistics and are excluded. \n\n4  International Energy Agency. 2005. Key World Energy Statistics 2005. In 2003, the per capita total primary energy \nsupply  of  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  members  averaged  4.67  tons  of  oil \nequivalent; Asia, excluding the People\u2019s Republic of China, 0.61; and the People\u2019s Republic of China, 1.10. \n\n5  BP  plc.  2005.  BP Statistical Review  of  World Energy 2005.

At the current \nproduction level of 80 MMSCMD, the reserves are expected to last for 31 years.  \n \n12. \nEven with new reserves, India\u2019s domestic supply is not likely to keep pace with demand \nand the country needs to import significant amounts of gas either as LNG or via pipeline. PLL\u2019s \nfirst phase terminal was India\u2019s first initiative in this direction and has added gas supply of 17.5 \nMMSCMD to domestic supply. Following PLL, Shell constructed a 2.5 MMTPA (8.8 MMSCMD \nof gas) at Hazira, Gujarat. PLL Dahej and Shell Hazira are the only LNG terminals operating in \nIndia today.  \n \n13. \nCurrent gas demand is estimated to be around 163 MMSCMD (equivalent of 43 MMTPA \nof LNG), against the total supply capacity of 99 MMSCMD (equivalent to 26 MMTPA of LNG), \nwhich implies a deficit of around 64 MMSCMD (17 MMTPA of LNG). The demand-supply gap is \nexpected  to  widen,  with  demand  projected  to  exceed  300  MMSCMD  by  2011  and  390 \nMMSCMD by 2024. Supply is projected to grow to around 250 MMSCMD, including PLL\u2019s Dahej \nexpansion  and  Kochi  terminal.  India  is  negotiating  with  Australia,  Iran,  Malaysia,  Oman,  and \nQatar  for  procurement  of  LNG.  India  has  not  started  importing  gas  by  pipeline  yet.  Plans  are \nunder  way  for  pipeline  import  from  Bangladesh,  Iran,  Myanmar,  and  Turkmenistan;  but  these \nare not expected to be implemented in the near future due to technical challenges and political \nsensitivities.  \n \n14. \nAbout 80% of natural gas is consumed by the power and fertilizer subsectors. Demand \nfrom other sectors is increasing, including refineries as fuel and feedstock; transport sector as \ncompressed  natural  gas;  petrochemical  plants  as  feedstock;  and  glass,  ceramics,  automotive \nindustries, sponge iron, and other industries as fuel. \n \n\n2. \n\nGas Sector Regulation \n\nIndia\u2019s oil and gas subsector is regulated in two areas: upstream and downstream. For \n15. \nthe  upstream,  exploration  and  production  is  regulated  by  the  Directorate  General  of \nHydrocarbons  under  the  administrative  control  of  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas \n(MPNG)  based  on  the  Oilfields  (Regulations  and  Development)  Act,  1948  and  the  Petroleum \nand  Natural  Gas  Rules,  1959.  The  downstream  has  been  regulated  by  the  Oil  Coordination \nCommittee, also under MPNG, based on the Petroleum Act, 1934 and control orders passed by \nMPNG from time to time. However, with the passing of the long-awaited Petroleum and Natural \nGas Regulatory Board Bill, 2005 by Parliament on 21 March 2006, the downstream regulation \nwill  be  transferred  to  an  independent  regulator,  the  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas  Regulatory \nBoard,  in  the  near  future.  The  board  will  regulate  refining;  processing;  storage;  transportation; \ndistribution; marketing; and sale of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas.  \n \n16.  With  liberalization  initiated  in  1991,  the  oil  and  gas  subsector  was  opened  to  private \nsector participation with concession rights awarded for a few small- and medium-sized fields for \ndevelopment  by  joint  ventures  and  the  private  sector.  The  1999  New  Exploration  Licensing \nPolicy  was  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  the  exploration  program;  concessions \nhave  been  awarded  through  five  rounds  of  bids.  The  Government  has  already  removed  all \nrestrictions on importing natural gas. The private sector is free to import gas either by pipeline or \nas  LNG.  While  GAIL  still  has  a  near  monopoly  on  onshore  transmission,  the  Petroleum  and \nNatural  Gas  Regulatory  Board  Act,  2006,  is  expected  to  induce  more  entrants  into  the \ntransmission business. Under the act, all gas pipelines will be required to offer open access to \nall users. Gas distribution is already open to the private sector. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nGas Price \n\n \n17. \nNatural  gas  sold  in  India  is  priced  differently  for  different  suppliers  and  users:  (i) \nnominated gas, which is produced by ONGC and Oil India Limited from the nominated reserves, \namounts  to  55  MMSCMD  and  is  distributed  by  GAIL  at  controlled  prices  determined  by  the \nadministered price mechanism; (ii) other domestic gas, amounting to 20 MMSCMD, is produced \nby joint ventures and private sector producers and sold directly to consumers at a market-linked \nprice; and (iii) imported gas (PLL and Shell Hazira), amounting to 27 MMSCMD, is sold at the \nmarket price.  \n \n18. \nIn  1997  the  Government  announced  phased  dismantling  of  the  administered  price \nmechanism  for  certain  petroleum  products.  In  March  2002,  it  gave  notice  that  marketing  and \npricing  of  all  petroleum  products  except  kerosene  and  LPG  was  to  be  deregulated  with  effect \nfrom April 2002. As of mid 2006, however, due to political reasons, nominated gas is still sold to \npower, fertilizer, compressed natural gas, and other small consumers at the administered price \nmechanism  price,  which  is  currently  $1.9/million  British  thermal  units  (MMBTU).  The  price \napplicable  to  other  users  of  nominated  gas  is  linked  to  the  price  of  imported  LNG,  which  is \ncurrently $3.5/MMBTU (ex LNG import terminal price [= LNG price + shipping + import tariff + \nregasification charge]). The price of other domestic gas, since July 2005, is market-linked, and \nis already very similar to the price of imported LNG. Gas to be produced from new fields will be \npriced completely freely.  \n \nB. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\ninvestments \n\nto  emphasize \n\n19.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program for India.6 It draws on all three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: \npro-poor  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  The  strategy  aims  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  high-growth  agenda  through  assistance  for  fiscal  consolidation,  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  private  sector  development.  Consensus  is  now  emerging  within  the \ndevelopment community on the strong nexus between infrastructure and poverty reduction. The \nincluding \nstrategy  aims \nhydrocarbons, to remove key bottlenecks where private investment is not forthcoming. Physical \ninvestments  are  also  to  be  combined  with  policy  reforms  and  capacity  building,  which  are  as \nimportant as physical investment in improving infrastructure.  \n \n20. \nPrivate  sector  development  is  integral  to  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy.  The  country \nstrategy  and  program  focuses  on  promoting  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  through  financial  sector  interventions  to  improve  financial  intermediation  and \nresource mobilization, policy reforms to remove impediments to private investment, investment \nin public infrastructure, public-private partnerships, and investments in private sector projects. A \nlist of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in India is in Appendix 2. \n \n\nin  publicly  provided \n\ninfrastructure, \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2003.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2003\u20132006)  India.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2005.  Country  Strategy  and \n\nProgram Update (2006\u20132008) India. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\n5\n\nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy7  designates  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \n21. \npoverty  by,  among  others,  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii) \npromoting  private  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  investors;  (iii)  addressing  regional  and  global  environmental \nimpacts; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages \nADB interventions to increase private sector participation in the energy sector to take advantage \nof  the  higher  operational  efficiencies  that  private  operators  can  achieve  and  to  meet  the  large \ncapital  requirements.  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  promotes  a  shift  to  cleaner  fuels  and \nprocesses,  which  in  India  includes  shifting  from  coal  to  natural  gas.  The  strategy  also \nencourages liberalization of markets and elimination of subsidies.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Project\u2019s Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n22. \nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country, energy sector, private sector development, and \nenvironmental  protection  strategies.  As  a  public-private  partnership,  PLL  was  the  first  step  in \ncommercializing the gas sector\u2019s LNG import segment, and the policy dialogue associated with \nPLL  has  led  to  delicensing  of  this  segment  and  deregulation  of  input  and  output  pricing.  The \nexpansion of PLL\u2019s terminal will augment supplies of environment-friendly fuel that will displace \nuse of more polluting fuels, and will do so cost-competitively. The Project will help India diversify \nits  energy  sources.  PLL\u2019s  successful  operation  has  demonstrated  that  the  concept  of  public-\nprivate partnership in infrastructure development that ADB has advocated can be implemented \nsuccessfully, with careful planning and structuring. This model has drawn the interest of several \ncountries in the region for possible replication. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nExisting Facilities \n\nThe Project involves the expansion initially to 7.5 MMTPA and later to 10 MMTPA of an \n23. \nexisting LNG import and regasification terminal with a capacity of 5 MMTPA at Dahej, Gujarat. \nPLL  is  the  owner  of  the  LNG  terminal.  The  existing  facilities  consist  of  marine  facilities; \nunloading facilities; two full containment LNG storage tanks each with a net capacity of 148,000 \ncubic  meters  (m3);  boil-off  gas  recovery  system  for  recondensation  of  boil-off  gas;  send-out \nfacilities, including \u201cshell and tube\u201d and \u201csubmerged combustion\u201d vaporizers; auxiliary facilities, \nincluding  a  gas-fired  captive  power  plant  with  three  7.6-megawatt  gas  turbines,  electrical  and \ncontrol systems, utilities production, metering, and fire and gas detection and protection system; \nand a jetty. \n \n24. \nOriginally,  a  660-meter  C-shaped  breakwater  was  included  in  the  first  phase  project \nscope  to  restrict  downtime  during  monsoons.  About  20%  of  work  was  completed  on  the \nbreakwater. However, based on the actual morphological data collected during implementation \nof the first phase project, PLL, in consultation with Gaz de France and other experts, concluded \nthat  the  estimated  downtime  without  the  breakwater  would  still  be  at  an  acceptable  level,  and \nthat  an  additional  LNG  storage  tank  would  provide  more  operational  flexibility  than  the \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fbreakwater.8 Thus PLL is removing the breakwater and constructing the third LNG storage tank. \nPLL is implementing this in conjunction with the processing capacity expansion.  \n \n\n2. \n\nExpansion Facilities \n\n25. \nThe Dahej terminal was designed with a configuration easily expandable to 10 MMTPA. \nThe  Project  will,  to  a  large  extent,  use  the  existing  facilities.  Additional  facilities  include  (i)  the \nthird  LNG  storage  tank  with  a  capacity  of  148,000  m3,  which  replaces  the  function  of  the \nbreakwater;  (ii)  the  fourth  LNG  storage  tank  with  a  net  capacity  of  148,000  m3;  (iii)  one \nadditional compressor for the boil-off gas recovery system; (iv) another set of send-out facilities \nwith in-tank pumps; (v) two additional gas turbines; and (v) other minor associated facilities.  \n \nB. \n\nManagement and Ownership \n\n26. \nPLL,  a  public  limited  company  established  under  the  Companies\u2019  Act,  1956  is \nimplementing the Project. Its sponsors are BPCL, GAIL, IOC, and ONGC, holding 50% in total. \nOther shareholders are GDF International (GDFI) holding 10%, ADB 5.2%, and public investors \n34.8%. PLL, a private sector company under the Indian Companies Act, is managed by a team \nof business professionals with energy sector and private sector backgrounds. \n \nBPCL, 66% owned by the Government, is India\u2019s second largest petroleum refining and \n27. \nmarketing company following IOC. GAIL, 57% owned by the Government, is India\u2019s largest gas \ntransmission  and  marketing  company.  IOC,  82%  owned  by  Government,  is  India\u2019s  largest \npetroleum  refining  and  marketing  company  and  is  ranked  170th  in  the  Fortune  500  list  of  the \nworld\u2019s  largest  companies.  IOC  has  also  been  ranked  first  in  petroleum  trading  among  the  15 \nnational  oil  companies  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  ONGC,  74%  owned  by  the  Government,  is \nIndia\u2019s  largest  oil  and  gas  producer,  accounting  for  nearly  80%  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas \nproduced domestically. All four sponsors are run commercially, with significant autonomy from \nthe Government.  \n \n28. \nGDFI is a subsidiary of Gaz de France S.A. (GDF), a state-owned natural gas company \nin France, and responsible for all GDF international operations. GDF, the world\u2019s fourth largest \npurchaser of natural gas and Europe\u2019s largest importer of LNG with a regasification capacity of \n42 MMSCMD, operates Europe\u2019s largest gas transmission and distribution system. In February \n2006, it announced a merger with Suez S.A., a Franco-Belgian multi-utility and the sixth largest \nnatural gas company in Europe. After the merger, GDF-Suez will become Europe\u2019s largest gas \ncompany. \n \n29. \nPLL\u2019s board has 15 members: secretary of MPNG (chairperson); and one representative \nfrom each of ADB, BPCL, GAIL, GDFI, IOC, ONGC, the lenders, and the Gujarat government;9 \nthree  management  staff  (managing  director  and  chief  executive  officer,  director  technical,  and \ndirector finance); and three independent directors. \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe Project\u2019s contractual framework is shown in Appendix 3. \n\n30. \n \n                                                 \n8  An LNG storage tank would mitigate the impact of suspension of LNG delivery resulting from not only bad weather \n\nconditions but also LNG receiving machinery breakdowns. \n\n9  The Gujarat government is not a shareholder of PLL but has the right to nominate a director on PLL\u2019s board as per \n\nthe concession agreement. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n1. \n\nConcession \n\n7\n\n31. \nPLL is implementing the first phase terminal and the Project on a build-operate-transfer \nbasis  under  a  30-year  concession10  from  the  Gujarat  Maritime  Board.  The  concession \nagreement was not executed in time for commencement of construction of the first phase and \nPLL  implemented  the  first  phase  based  on  a  letter  of  intent  from  the  Gujarat  Maritime  Board, \npursuant  to  which  it  took  over  the  land  measuring  58.6  hectares.  The  concession  agreement \nwas finally signed on 20 December 2005.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLiquefied Natural Gas Supply \n\n32. \nPLL  is  currently  sourcing  5  MMTPA  of  LNG  for  the  first  phase  production  from  Ras \nLaffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company Limited (II) (Rasgas II) under a 25-year LNG sales and \npurchase  agreement  (SPA)  dated  31  July  1999.  Rasgas  II  was  selected  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  Rasgas  II  is  a  joint  venture  between  Qatar  Petroleum  (70%)  and \nExxonMobil  Corporation  (30%).  The  two  companies  have  access  to  North  Field,11  one  of  the \nworld\u2019s largest nonassociated gas fields, with the proven and probable reserve of 25,000 bcm \n(18,000 MMT in LNG equivalent). The recoverable reserves of the blocks allocated to Rasgas II \nare about 900 bcm (650 MMT in LNG equivalent).  \n \nThe LNG SPA obligates supply and offtake  of 7.5 MMTPA, of which 5.0 MMTPA is for \n33. \nthe  first  phase  of  the  Dahej  terminal  and  2.5  MMTPA  (tranche  A)  was  originally  intended  for \nPLL\u2019s  other  proposed  terminal  in  Kochi,  Kerala,  which  is  at  the  initial  stages  of  planning  and \ndevelopment. PLL and Rasgas II have agreed to reallocate tranche A to the Project because the \nProject  is  progressing  faster  than  the  Kochi  terminal.  Two  side  letters  were  executed  on  22 \nSeptember  2005  and  20  December  2005  respectively  to  indicate  the  commencement  date, \nquality, and quantity of tranche A LNG. Rasgas II is obligated to start supply of tranche A on 1 \nOctober 2009, while the completion of the expansion facilities and the delivery date of the third \nLNG tanker are expected on 31 March 2009. During this 6-month period, PLL hopes to acquire \nLNG  from  Rasgas  II  from  its  spare  capacity12  or  buy  LNG  on  short-term  contracts  from  other \nsources.13  \n \nPLL is obligated to purchase LNG from Rasgas II on a take-or-pay basis for 25 years at \n34. \na  fixed  price  of  $2.53/MMBTU  for  the  first  5  years  of  the  contract  (January  2004\u2013December \n2008). During the remaining contract period, the LNG price will fluctuate with the Japan crude-\noil cocktail price of crude oils, with a cap and a floor. \n \n\n3. \n\nLiquefied Natural Gas Transport \n\nCurrently,  two  dedicated  tankers,  with  a  capacity  of  138,000  m3  each,  transport  LNG \n35. \nfrom  Qatar  under  two  25-year  time  charter  agreements  (TCAs)  awarded  through  ICB.  The \n\n                                                 \n10 The  terminal  facilities  are  divided  into  the  port  terminal  and  the  regasification  facility.  After  30  years  the  port \nterminal will be transferred to the Gujarat Maritime Board. PLL will own the regasification facility for 90 years. PLL \nwill maintain its access to and use of the port terminal by a port-user agreement with the Gujarat Maritime Board.  \n11  North Field, discovered in 1971, extends over 6,000 square kilometers, predominantly underwater, to the northeast \nof Qatar. A portion of North Field underlies the Qatari landmass and another portion extends into Iran\u2019s territorial \nwaters. \n\n12 Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil, through another joint venture, own trains 1 and 2 with a capacity of 3.3 MMTPA \neach. Rasgas II owns and operates trains 3 and 4 with a capacity of 4.78 MMTPA each, and is constructing train 5 \nof the same capacity. Yet another joint venture of Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil is constructing trains 6 and 7 \nwith a capacity of 7.8 MMTPA each. Tranche A for PLL will be produced at train 7. \n\n13 An LNG tanker is available for spot hiring at a price of $70,000\u2013$80,000 per day depending on the demand. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\ntankers  are  owned  by  two  consortia  comprising  Mitsui  OSK  Lines  Limited  (29.1%),  Shipping \nCorporation  of  India  Limited  (29.1%),  Nippon  Yusen  KK  (17.9%),  Kawasaki  Kisen  KK  (8.9%), \nand  Qatar  Shipping  Corporation  (15%).14  The  tankers  were  built  by  Daewoo  Shipbuilding  and \nMarine Engineering Company Limited. Both tankers were delivered in advance of the contract \ndelivery dates and have been operating without any problems. \n \n36. \nPLL  conducted  an  ICB  for  a  TCA  for  the  2.5  MMTPA  of  additional  LNG  supply  from \nRasgas  II  and  awarded  the  contract  to  a  consortium  of  Mitsui  OSK,  Shipping  Corporation  of \nIndia,  Nippon  Yusen,  and  Kawasaki  Kisen.  The  contract  contained  an  option  for  PLL  to  get  a \nshare in the consortium for assignment to Qatar. This time, Qatar Gas Transportation Company \nwill  have  a  20%  share  and  PLL  will  retain  a  3%  share,  leaving  26%  each  for  Mitsui  OSK  and \nShipping Corporation, 16.7% for Nippon Yusen, and 8.3% for Kawasaki Kisen. The third tanker \nwill have a capacity of 154,800 m3 and be constructed by Samsung Heavy Industries. The third \nTCA was executed on 21 February 2006. \n \n\n4. \n\nGas Offtake \n\n37. \nGas from the first phase terminal is being purchased by GAIL, IOC, BPCL (offtakers) in \nthe  ratio  of  60%,  30%,  and  10%  respectively  under  gas  sales  and  purchase  agreements \n(GSPAs).  The  rights  and  obligations  under  the  GSPAs  mirror  those  under  the  Rasgas  II  LNG \nSPA: as long as PLL takes or pays for LNG and delivers gas, the offtakers are obligated to take \nor pay for the gas. The offtakers have agreed to purchase tranche A gas in the same proportion \nand on the same terms and conditions as the first 5 MMTPA. This agreement was recorded in a \nside letter to each of the GSPAs dated 31 December 2005 for GAIL and 29 December 2005 for \nIOC and BPCL. \n \n38. \nThe offtakers sell almost all of the gas to third parties. The end users are predominantly \nindustrial users along the Hazira\u2013Bijaypur\u2013Jadgishpur (HBJ) pipeline, who have switched from \nmore expensive alternatives such as naphtha and diesel to natural gas. The first phase Dahej \nterminal and the Shell Hazira terminal, the second LNG terminal in India, have not satisfied the \ndemand in Gujarat and surrounding areas. Significant gas supply shortage is projected in areas \ncurrently  served  or  could  be  served  by  PLL  if  a  pipeline  connection  is  established.  Additional \noutput  from PLL  is  expected  to  be  absorbed  again  by  industrial  users  along  the  HBJ  pipeline, \nincluding the offtakers\u2019 plants. In addition, GAIL is laying a 475 km pipeline connecting Dahej to \nUran in Maharashtra targeting completion within 2006. Once this pipeline is operational, PLL will \nbe able to expand its service area to Maharashtra, India\u2019s most industrialized state. \n \n39. \nPLL\u2019s gas price is set commercially without any government control. It is currently \n$3.51/MMBTU at PLL\u2019s delivery point (ex-terminal price) and consists of (i) the LNG rate, (ii) the \ntaxes  and  duties  rate,  and  (iii)  the  regasification  rate.  The  LNG  and  taxes  and  duties  rates \nreflect the actual cost of LNG supply and taxes and duties. The regasification rate covers PLL\u2019s \noperation and maintenance costs, debt service, and return to shareholders.  \n \n40. \nPLL\u2019s gas price is considerably higher than the price of nominated gas to the protected \nend users (power, fertilizer, and small users) of $1.9/MMBTU, but compares favorably with the \nprice of other domestic gas. PLL gas does not compete with nominated gas or other domestic \ngas;  rather  PLL  gas  has  met  and  will  continue  to  meet  demand  that  is  either  not  met  at  all, \n\n39. \n\n                                                 \n14 The  consortia  originally  consisted  of  Mitsui  OSK,  Shipping  Corporation  of  India,  Nippon  Yusen,  and  Kawasaki \nKisen. The contract contained an option for PLL to obtain a share in the consortia for assignment to Qatar. Qatar \nShipping Corporation subsequently bought a 15% share in both consortia. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ncausing  capacity  underutilization,  or  met  by  more  expensive  alternate  fuels  such  as  naphtha, \ndiesel,  and fuel  oil.  Domestic  gas  from  newly  found  reserves  is  not  considered  a threat  to  the \nDahej terminal. Projections from various sources of gas demand and supply suggest that, even \nincluding new domestic gas supply sources, the demand-supply gap will not disappear for the \nforeseeable future.  \n \n41. \nThe take-or-pay  GSPAs contractually shield PLL from  market risk. The primary  risk for \nPLL  is  the  creditworthiness  of  the  offtakers.  GAIL  and  IOC  are  rated  AAA  by  the  India  Credit \nRating  Agency,  and  BPCL  is  rated  AAA  by  the  Credit  Rating  Information  System  of  India \nLimited.15 Introduction of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act in the near future \nwill mean not only more competition for GAIL but also more business opportunities, which GAIL, \nwith its dominant infrastructure, should be able to take advantage of. IOC and BPCL have been \nmaking losses over the past year due to crude oil price hikes without commensurate increase of \npetroleum  product  prices.  In  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  (FY)  2006,  both  companies  (along \nwith  Hindustan  Petroleum  Corporation  Limited,  the  third  largest  petroleum  company  after  the \ntwo) recorded losses for the first time in history, which continued until the third quarter. All three \nearn  a  wide  refining  margin,  but  the  prices  of their  products  are  regulated  by  the  Government \nbelow  the  cost-recovery  level.  Altogether  losses  of  Rs400  billion  are  expected  for  FY2006  for \nthe  entire  downstream  oil  industry,  all  such  losses  will  be  supplemented  by  the  Government. \nThe India Credit Rating Agency and Credit Rating Information System of India Limited believe \nthat  IOC  and  BPCL\u2019s  downturn  is  temporary,  and  that  with  liberalization  of  the  downstream \npetroleum industry, particularly retail product pricing, IOC and BPCL business will grow to meet \never-increasing energy demand in the country and the region. IOC and BPCL are expected to \nmaintain the AAA rating for the foreseeable future. The business and financial performance of \nthe three offtakers are summarized in Appendix 4. \n \n\n5. \n\nGas Transport \n\nPLL  gas  is  transported  through  the  HBJ  pipeline,  India\u2019s  major  trunk  line  operated  by \n42. \nGAIL.  It  covers  Gujarat,  Western  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Haryana,  and \nDelhi.  IOC  and  BPCL  executed  gas  transmission  agreements  with  GAIL,  which  have  been \namended by side letters dated 29 December 2005 to reflect increased gas transmission volume \nfor  tranche  A  supply.  Under  the  gas  transmission  agreements,  GAIL  is  obligated  to  transport \ngas  to  receiving  points  of  IOC  and  BPCL\u2019s  end  users.  PLL  is  contractually  protected  from  the \ngas transportation risk as it is entitled to receive take-or-pay gas charges from the offtakers as \nlong as it is in a position to supply gas to designated entry points on the pipelines. \n \n43. \nThe  original  HBJ  pipeline  had  a  capacity  of  33  MMSCMD,  of  which  30  MMSCMD  was \nused. To accommodate gas from PLL, GAIL expanded the capacity to 56 MMSCMD by laying \nan 82 km pipeline from Dahej to Vemar, Gujarat, and a 528 km pipeline parallel to the existing \nHBJ  pipeline  from  Vemar  to  Bijaypur,  Madhya  Pradesh.  Currently,  40  MMSCMD  of  the \nexpanded HBJ pipeline is being used, including 18 MMSCMD for PLL, leaving spare capacity of \n16  MMSCMD.  PLL  gas  requires  additional  9  MMSCMD  transmission  capacity  at  7.5  MMTPA \nproduction, and 18 MMSCMD at 10 MMTPA. With an additional compressor, the HBJ pipeline \ncapacity  can  be  raised  by  7  MMSCMD,  thus  all  PLL  gas,  even  at  the  10  MMTPA  production \nlevel, can be transported through the HBJ pipeline. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 The  India  Credit  Rating  Agency  and  Credit  Rating  Information  System  of  India  Limited  are  India\u2019s  major  credit \n\nrating agencies. \n\n \n\n\fIn addition, GAIL is laying a 475 km pipeline connecting Dahej to Uran in Maharashtra, \n44. \ntargeting completion within 2006. Once this pipeline is operational, PLL will be able to expand \nits service area to Maharashtra. The Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline will have a capacity of 12 MMSCMD.  \n\n \n6. \n\nConstruction \n\n45. \nThe  first  phase  terminal,  except  the  breakwater,  was  successfully  completed  in \naccordance  with  an  EPC  contract  by  a  consortium  of  Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy  Industries \nCompany Limited (IHI), Ballast Nedam International BV, Toyo Engineering India Limited, Toyo \nEngineering  Corporation,  Itochu  Corporation,  and  Mitsui  &  Company  Limited.  This  consortium \nwas  selected  through  an  ICB.  The  terminal  was  commissioned  on  9  April  2004  and  the \nprovisional  acceptance  certificate,  which  marked  the  commencement  of  the  warranty  and  the \nlatent  defects  liability  period,  was  achieved  on  13  June  2004.  PLL  and  the  EPC  contractor \nexecuted a supplemental agreement on 8 December 2005 to remove the breakwater from the \nscope of work and reduce the contract price. \n \nThe  EPC  contract  for  the  third  LNG  storage  tank  was  awarded  to  IHI  alone  without \n46. \nbidding.  After  analyzing  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  contracting  with  the  same  or  a \ndifferent  contractor,  PLL  concluded  that  engaging  the  original  EPC  contractor  would  reduce \nimplementation  time  as  a  detailed  engineering  design  could  be  skipped  based  on  the  design \nand drawing for the existing two tanks. As per this lump-sum, fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey \nEPC  contract  dated  9  December  2005,  the  work  has  commenced  and  the  tank  will  be \ncompleted by 26 December 2008. The third tank is being constructed ahead of the expansion \nfacilities to allow increase of output even before completion of the expansion facilities if short-\nterm LNG supply can be arranged. \n \n47. \nThe  EPC  contract  for  the  expansion  facilities  was  awarded  through  a  fresh  ICB  to  a \nconsortium  comprising  IHI,  Toyo  Engineering  India  Limited,  Toyo  Engineering  Corporation, \nItochu  Corporation,  and  Mitsui  &  Company  Limited.  This  contract,  dated  23  January  2006,  is \nalso on a lump-sum, fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey basis, with performance guarantees. The \nguaranteed provisional acceptance date is 26 June 2008 for the regasification facilities and 26 \nDecember  2008  for  the  fourth  tank.  Adding  a  3-month  commissioning  period,  the  expansion \nfacilities will be ready to commence commercial operations by the end of March 2009.  \n \n\n7. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nFollowing  industry  practice,  PLL,  as  the  owner,  has  operated  and  maintained  the \n48. \nterminal with its in-house staff. PLL was supported with key personnel for the initial period from \nONGC  and  technical  support  from  GDFI.  As  per  the  technical  services  agreement,  dated  21 \nOctober  2003,  GDFI  provided  comprehensive  training  of  operators  and  managers  at  GDF\u2019s \nfacilities,  onboard  LNG  tankers,  and  at  the  Dahej  terminal.  GDF  developed  and  updated  the \noperating  procedure  from  time  to  time.  The  technical  services  agreement,  scheduled  to \nterminate on 1 September 2005, was extended until 31 August 2006 with a reduced scope of \nwork,  focusing  on  safety  aspects,  in  particular,  ensuring  that  a  proper  lock-out  procedure  is \nfollowed  in  case  of  LNG  leakage.  According  to  GDF,  the  terminal  system  is  already  well \nunderstood by PLL and the certification of compliance was obtained.   \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n49. \nThe  first  phase  terminal  was  assigned  environmental  category  A.  However,  the \nproposed  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  as  the  major  facilities  to  be \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nconstructed  during  the  expansion  phase  will  involve  only  two  additional  storage  tanks  and \nassociated  equipment.  Both  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  reports,  one  for \nonshore  storage  and  regasification  facilities  and  the  other  for  marine  facilities,  were  updated. \nThe existing LNG terminal received a no-objection certificate from the Gujarat Pollution Control \nBoard  based  on  the  original  EIA  reports  prepared  during  1999\u20132000,  which  also  cover  the \nsecond phase of development. However, the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MEF) granted \nenvironmental clearance only for the first phase development. PLL submitted the two updated \nEIA  reports  to  MEF  in  April  2005  and  received  environmental  clearance  for  the  Project  from \nMEF on 23 November 2005.16 The summary initial environmental examination was prepared in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  and  information  disclosure  for \nenvironmental category B projects. The summary initial environmental examination is based on \nthe existing EIA documents as well as the two updated EIA reports, and has been posted on the \nADB website. The Project is being implemented  within the existing site and no additional land \nacquisition is required. The Project is not being implemented in areas inhabited by indigenous \npeople. The Project has been assigned category C for impact on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous people. \n \n50. \nPLL  has  been  accredited  with  ISO  9001,  OHSAS  18001  for  it  occupational  health  and \nsafety  management  system,  and  ISO  14001  for  its  environmental  management  system.  In \naddition, PLL strictly enforces a policy and a manual on health, safety, and environment, which \nincludes  an  emergency  response  plan.  Since  the  commencement  of  operations,  the  existing \nLNG  terminal  has  not  experienced  major  incidents  related  to  environment  and  safety  or \noccupational  health.  Environmental  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring  program  for  the \nconstruction  and  operation  phases  of  the  Project  were  developed  from  the  existing  measures \nand program, which are based on best practices of LNG industries. The impact of construction \nactivities  of  the  two  LNG  storage  tanks,  such  as  dust,  noise,  and  emissions  of  heavy \nconstruction equipment and vehicles, will be insignificant and confined within the existing project \nsite with no communities nearby. The health, safety, and environment unit will monitor the EPC \ncontractor\u2019s  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Gujarat  Pollution  Control  Board  and  MEF. \nDuring  operation,  the  only  cumulative  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  increased \ngaseous  emissions  from  the  additional  gas  turbine  generators  and  vaporizers.  Natural  gas  is \nconsidered a clean fuel with a low impact on air quality. Nitrogen oxide, the major air pollutant, \nwill  be  controlled  through  the  use  of  lean-burn  technology  in  the  gas  turbine  generators,  and \nhigh  stacks  for  rapid  dispersion  of  emissions.  The  emission  of  nitrogen  oxides  after  the \nexpansion is predicted to be within the limit prescribed under the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandard.17 \n \n51. \nSafety is the key issue for LNG terminal operations. The major risks are pool-fires and \nvapor  dispersion  if  LNG  spills  or  leaks  from  the  storage  tanks,  pipelines,  and  process \nequipment.  PLL  will  comply  with \nfor  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation  of  LNG  terminal  facilities,18  as  well  as  emergency  response  and \ndisaster management plan and procedures, which were adopted during the phase I project. The \n                                                 \n16 In  updating  the  EIA  for  the  Project,  public  consultation  was  carried  out  in  a  more  limited  scale  since  the  public \nconsultation  during  the  previous  EIA  already  included  public  meetings  and  newspaper  announcements  to  inform \nthe public of the Project and solicit their comments and covered the full-scale development. In addition, the Project \nis  located  within  the  boundary  of  the  existing  project  site.  PLL  published  the  project  information  as  well  as  the \nMEF\u2019s  environmental  clearance  on  30  November  2005  in  two  local  newspapers  and  also  on  MEF\u2019s  website.  No \npublic concerns were received after the publication of the project information.  \n\nthe  well-established \n\nindustry  standards \n\n17 Based on a model of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n18 Both  the  national  design  codes,  i.e.,  the  Oil  Industry  Safety  Directorate  OISD\u201494,  and  the  international  design \nstandards, i.e., the European standard, EN\u20141473, the US National Fire Protection Association standard, NFPA\u2014\n59A and British Standard BS777. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ntwo additional storage tanks will be full containment tanks, following the same standards as the \ntwo  existing  LNG  storage  tanks.  Full  containment  tanks  have  the  highest  standard  of  safety \nfeatures  compared  with  single  and  double  containment  tanks.  The  standard  practices  reduce \nthe probability of explosion and pool fire caused by LNG leakage from pipes and storage tanks \nto  extremely  low  levels.19  The  consequence  analysis  of  an  LNG  leakage  under  the  EIA  of  the \nphase I project indicated that the vapor dispersion exclusion zone and thermal exclusion zone \nare within the site boundary. \n \nThe facilities not within the scope of the Project but associated with the Project are the \n52. \nthree pipelines that transport or will transport the gas from the Project: Dahej\u2013Vemar, Vemar\u2013\nBijaypur,  and  Dahej\u2013Uran  pipelines.  All  are  owned  and  operated  by  GAIL.  The  Dahej\u2013Vemar \nand  Vemar\u2013Bijaypur  pipelines  received  no-objection  certificates  from  the  pollution  control \nboards  of  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh  states  and  MEF  environmental  clearance,  and  are \nalready in operation. The 82 km Dahej\u2013Vemar pipeline was constructed on a new right-of-way \nacquired by GAIL. The 528 km Vemar\u2013Bijaypur pipeline was constructed parallel to the original \nHBJ pipeline on the existing right-of-way owned by  GAIL.  According to GAIL, the handover of \nland was temporary and the affected people were duly compensated. In July 2004 the new 475 \nkm Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline received environmental clearance from MEF; construction is expected \nto  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2006.  The  EIA  of  the  Dahej\u2013Uran  pipeline  found  no  significant \nenvironmental  impacts;  the  pipeline  corridor  will  not  traverse  ecologically  sensitive  areas.  Due \ndiligence is ongoing on the handover and compensation process of the land for the Dahej\u2013Uran \npipeline.  \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n1. \n \n53. \nThe  Project  aims  to  promote  India\u2019s  sustainable  economic  development  by  providing \ncleaner and lower cost energy. With the duly completed and operated expansion facilities of the \nLNG  terminal  (outputs),  the  Project  will  provide  additional  natural  gas  to  industrial  and \nhousehold users (outcome). The Project will help India increase energy supply, shift to cleaner \nenergy  away  from  more  polluting  energy,  and  enhance  energy  security  by  diversifying  the \nenergy base (impact).  \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \nThe development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \n54. \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of multilateral development banks. In \nterms of private sector  development impact at the company level, the first phase terminal has \ntransferred managerial and operational know-how and skills required of an LNG terminal for the \nfirst  time  to  India  through  technical  support  by  GDFI.  Through  expanded  operation  of  the \nterminal, the Project will continue to improve the skills and knowledge of local staff. During the 3 \nyears of construction, PLL will employ about 500 workers on average. Currently, PLL employs \nabout 145 staff for its existing operations at the terminal and 55 staff at its head office in Delhi. \nAn  additional  176  staff  will  be  employed  indirectly  through  shipping  LNG,  outsourcing  jetty \nmanagement, and security. The Project is expected to increase the total number of staff at the \n\n                                                 \n19 The probability for pipeline rupture is estimated at 9 x 10-9 per year, while that for the LNG storage tank on fire is 2 \n\nx 10\u201328. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nterminal to 204. The Project is expected to yield private sector development impact beyond the \ncompany.  The  first  phase  terminal  has  demonstrated  that  an  LNG  terminal  could  be \nimplemented as a public-private partnership successfully and profitably in India and could attract \ncommercial  financing.  The  Project  will  (i)  demonstrate  good  practices  in  public-private \npartnership in infrastructure development and financing; (ii) provide a benchmark for other gas \nproducers \nfacilitate \nrationalization of gas price; and (v) in the long run, improve efficiency in the gas subsector and \ncontribute  to  the  generation  of  more  affordable  environment-friendly  energy.  The  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nF. \n\nterms  of  pricing  and  operation;  (iii)  promote  competition;  (iv) \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\nin \n\nThe economic analysis of the Project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n55. \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects. The economic analysis adopts conservative assumptions \nand  covers  the  same  period  as  the  financial  evaluation.  The  incremental  gas  supply  from  the \nProject will meet both incremental and nonincremental demand. Incremental demand stems from \nthe  expansion  of  industrial  projects,  and  economic  benefits  are  the  economic  value-added  of \nthese projects. Nonincremental demand represents the replacement of more expensive fuel like \nnaphtha, and resource cost savings are treated as economic benefits.  \n \nEconomic  costs  include  both  incremental  costs  directly  related  to  the  expansion  of  the \n56. \nLNG  terminal  and  incremental  costs  of  associated  facilities,  which  are  borne  by  the  offtakers \nand  end  users.  Incremental  costs  incurred  by  PLL  include  capital  costs  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs.  A  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  was  applied  to  traded  components  of  the \ncosts.  Labor  conversion  factors  were  applied  to  unskilled  and  skilled  labor.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 28.6%, which is above the social discount rate of 12%. The \nresults of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the Project will be economically robust and viable \nunder adverse scenarios.  \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\n57. \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  of  up  to  Rs6.750  billion  to  PLL  will  be  denominated  in  Indian \nrupees and provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee but \nwith  a  KfW  PCG  covering  up  to  Rs3.375  billion  of  amounts  outstanding  under  the  ADB  loan. \nADB will be exposed to the credit risk of KfW, which is rated AAA; therefore ADB\u2019s net exposure \nto the risk of PLL will be reduced. The financing structure whereby KfW participates with a PCG \nin the ADB loan is proposed for two reasons. First, by having risk participation by a third party \nfinancial institution, ADB\u2019s net exposure to the risk of PLL could be reduced to the level within \nADB\u2019s  single  project  exposure  limit  applicable  for  nonsovereign  guaranteed  operations.20 \n\n                                                 \n20 Reducing  ADB\u2019s  risk  exposure  to  a  project  by  obtaining  a  guarantee  from  another  financial  institution  was \nenvisaged in ADB. 1985.

Manila (R194-05 dated 4 August). \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n59. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSecond, this structure would enable KfW, which does not currently have rupee funding capacity, \nto assist a project that needs long-term rupee financing.  \n \n58. \nADB has an existing equity investment in PLL. The ADB loan amount will be determined \nso  that  ADB\u2019s  total  net  exposure  to  the  PLL  risk,  including  that  from  ADB\u2019s  existing  equity \ninvestment in PLL, and taking into account the KfW PCG coverage will be up to Rs3.375 billion \n(equivalent to $75 million), the single project exposure limit.  \n \nB. \n\nJustification  \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nThe Project will help India meet the growing demand for energy and contribute to \nIndia\u2019s  sustainable  economic  development  by  providing  cleaner  and  lower  cost \nfuel  and  feedstock  to  industrial  users  and  households.  The  Project  will  enable \nsupply  of  natural  gas  to  several  cities  and  towns  in  north  India  for  provision  of \ncompressed natural gas for industrial and public transportation use. This will help \nreduce pollution levels.21 \n\nThe  Project  will  enhance  energy  security  by  diversifying  the  energy  base  away \nfrom coal and imported oil. India is close to large gas reserves in the Middle East \nand  Central  Asia,  and  so  the  rationale  for  increasing  LNG  receiving  terminal \ncapacity on India\u2019s west coast is strong. Alternative plans to import gas through \ntranscontinental pipelines require prior resolution of technical and political issues, \nwhich will take time. \n\nPLL  operates  the  first  LNG  terminal  in  India  and  ADB\u2019s  support  since  project \nconceptualization  has  had  demonstration  effects  and  promoted  strategic  private \nsector  investment  in  the  gas  sector.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  Project  will \nstrengthen PLL\u2019s operation as a private sector entity and facilitate PLL\u2019s dialogue \nwith the Government on gas sector reform. \n\nThe Project (a) embodies ADB\u2019s country and energy strategies, which emphasize \nsupporting energy infrastructure development with private sector participation; (b) \nsupports \nthematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector \ndevelopment, good governance, and environmental protection; (c) demonstrates \ngood practices in public-private partnership in infrastructure development; and (d) \nwill  transfer  the  best  available  technology  and  know-how  in  LNG  terminal \noperation.  \n\nADB\u2019s  loan  will  provide  rupee-denominated  long-term  financing  with  a  fixed \ninterest  rate,  much  needed  for  infrastructure  development  in  India.  Long-term, \nlocal  currency, \nfinancing  enhances  sustainability  and \naffordability  of  projects  and  avoids  a  mismatch  between  the  currency  of \nborrowing  and  the  currency  of  revenue.  Indian financial institutions  have  limited \ncapacity to provide long-term, fixed-rate funding. \n\ninterest  rate \n\nfixed \n\n \n                                                 \n21 ADB  is  also  supporting  construction  of  gas  distribution  networks  in  Kanpur  to  deliver  compressed  natural  gas  to \nvehicles  and  piped  natural  gas  to  commercial,  industrial,  and  residential  users.

The financing documentation between ABD \nand PLL will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n\nVI.  REQUEST TO WAIVE CERTAIN INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n\nThe proposed loan of up to Rs6.750 billion to PLL will, once approved, represent 8.0% of \n61. \nthe  total  exposure  of  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations\u2019  portfolio  and  will  exceed  the  single \nproject,  group,  and  sector  exposure  limits  as  shown  in  Table  6.  However,  if  the  portion  of  the \nloan  guaranteed  by  KfW  is  deducted  from  the  computation  of  the  exposure  to  PLL  risk,  the \nresidual  net  exposure  to  PLL\u2019s  risk  would  be  up  to  $75  million  equivalent,  within  the  single \nproject  and  group  exposure  limits.  ADB\u2019s  Risk  Management  Unit  has  considered  these \nbreaches and supports a waiver of each of these limits for the proposed ADB assistance. Board \napproval  is  requested  on  the  waiver  of  the  single  project  exposure  limit.  Management  has \nendorsed this request and endorsed the waivers of the group and sector exposure limits. \n \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption.

BPCL\u2019s paid-up capital as of 31 March 2005 was Rs3 billion, \nof which the Government held 66.2%. BPCL is listed on the national, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, \nand  Mumbai  stock  exchanges;  and  is  rated  AAA  by  the  Credit  Rating  Information  System  of \nIndia Limited. It ranked 429th in the Fortune 500 list.  \n \n2. \nBPCL  operates  an  integrated  refinery,  and  markets  petroleum  products  including \nlubricant  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  It  is  India\u2019s  second  largest  petroleum  company, \nwith about a 22% share of the domestic petroleum market. BPCL recorded crude throughput of \n19.10  million  metric  tons  per  annum  (MMTPA)  (including  BPCL\u2019s  refinery  at  Mumbai,  Kochi \nRefineries Limited [KRL] and Numaligarh Refinery Limited) and market sales of 21.8 MMTPA in \nFY2005. The group\u2019s net sales increased from Rs555.6 billion in FY2004 to Rs644.2 billion in \nFY2005. However, its net profit declined from Rs23.6 billion to Rs20.7 billion due mainly to the \ncontrol  over  retail  petroleum  prices  and  reduction  in  marketing  margin.  BPCL\u2019s  marketing \nbusiness  is  required  to  purchase  its  products  from  refineries  at  import  parity  prices,  while  it  is \nsubject  to  government  controls  on  retail  prices.  Nevertheless,  the  adverse  impact  on  the \nmarketing  margin  has  been  partially  offset  by  the  strong  refinery  margin  due  to  a  rise  in \npetroleum  prices.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  implemented  measures  to  revive  the \ndeteriorating financial condition of oil marketing companies by allowing limited price increases in \nJune  and  September  2005,  and  requiring  upstream  oil  companies  to  offer  discounts  to  oil \nmarketing  companies.  These  factors  contributed  to  BPCL\u2019s  stable  financial  performance. \nBPCL\u2019s consolidated financial statements are summarized in Table A4.1. \n \nCurrently, BPCL\u2019s organization structure consists of one asset-based strategic business \n3. \nunit,  which  is  a  refinery,  and  five  customer  interface  strategic  business  units  along  its  product \nlines, i.e., aviation, industrial and commercial, LPG, lubricants, and retail. BPCL recently merged \nwith  KRL,  its  subsidiary  with  a  54.81%  stake.  KRL  benefited  from  a  high  refining  margin  in \nFY2005  and  recorded  net  profit  of  Rs8.42  billion,  an  increase  of  52%  from  the  previous  year. \nThe  merger  will  result  in  savings  due  to  synergies  in  its  operations  and  savings  on  sales  tax, \nwhich KRL has been paying on its output sold to BPCL.  \n \nBPCL  recently  completed  the  expansion  and  modernization  program  of  its  Mumbai \n4. \nrefinery, increasing capacity to 12 MMTPA from 6.9 MMTPA, and plans to set up a refinery with \n6  MMTPA  at  Bina,  Madhya  Pradesh  through  its  subsidiary,  Bharat  Oman  Refineries  Limited. \nFurthermore,  it  aims  to  expand  its  retail  distribution  network  from  6,500  to  more  than  7,000 \noutlets. BPCL has received ISO 9002 certification for its refinery at Mumbai, LPG bottling plants, \nand  lube  blending  plant.  It  has  also  received  ISO  14001  certification  for  its  environmental \nmanagement  system,  and  OSHAS  18001  certification  for  its  occupational  health  and  safety \nmanagement system. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.1: Financial Summary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited \n(Rs million) \n\nFY2005\n\nFY2003\n\n7.97\n3.48\n1.15\n29.70\n\n6.18\n3.10\n0.77\n22.23\n\nGAIL (India) Limited  \n\n   503,770 \n     20,654 \n   524,424 \n482,649 \n     41,775 \n     18,225 \n\n   108,856 \n   105,837 \n   223,378 \n     91,569 \n     58,187 \n   162,024 \n     61,353 \n\n          644,248 \n            23,773 \n668,022 \n626,758 \n           41,264 \n20,741 \n\n          135,627 \n          125,399 \n          264,815 \n            99,322 \n            55,478 \n          171,498 \n            93,317 \n\nFY2004 \n \n         555,630  \n             3,065  \n558,695  \n         509,219  \n49,476  \n           23,644  \n \n         109,165  \n         115,252  \n         231,042  \n           91,625  \n           47,023  \n         153,089  \n           77,953  \n \n8.86 \n4.23 \n0.79 \n30.33 \n\nItem \nIncome Statement Data \nNet Sales \nOther Income \nTotal Income \nExpenditures \nEBITDA \nNet Profit \nBalance Sheet Data \nCurrent Assets \nFixed Assets and Intangible Assets \nTotal Assets \nCurrent Liabilities \nLoans \nTotal Liabilities \nShareholders' Equity \nRatios \nEBITDA Margin (%) \nNet Profit Margin (%) \nLong-Term Debt to Equity Ratio \nReturn on Equity (%) \nEBITDA= earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nGAIL  (India)  Limited  (GAIL),  the  principal  gas  transmission  and  marketing  company  in \nIndia, was set up by the Government in 1984 to create infrastructure for sustained development \nof the market in the country. Since its establishment, GAIL has expanded into gas processing, \npetrochemicals,  LPG  transmission,  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  regasification,  city  gas \ndistribution, exploration and production, and telecommunications. As of 31 March 2005, GAIL\u2019s \npaid-up  share  capital  was  Rs8.46  billion,  of  which  the  Government  held  57.3%;  its  market \ncapitalization was recorded at Rs179.45 billion. GAIL is listed on the Mumbai and national stock \nexchanges in India; as well as the London Stock Exchange. In 2005, GAIL was ranked among \nthe top 10 Indian companies in terms of profits and revenues. It is rated AAA by the India Credit \nRating Agency.  \n \n6. \nCurrently, GAIL has a near monopoly position in the natural gas transmission business \nthrough  its  ownership  and  operation  of  India\u2019s  largest  gas  transmission  networks  for  the  total \nlength  of  5,340  kilometers  (km),  representing  88%  market  share.  In  addition,  it  owns  and \noperates  the  world\u2019s  longest  exclusive  LPG  pipeline  with  total  length  of  1,269  km;  seven  gas \nprocessing  facilities  with  aggregate  capacity  of  1.3  MMTPA  of  LPG,  propane,  and  other  liquid \nhydrocarbons; and India\u2019s largest gas-based petrochemicals complex. \n \nGAIL is the sole transporter and the principal marketer of the regasified LNG from PLL. \n7. \nGAIL  has  constructed  a  610  km  long  pipeline  from  Dahej  in  Gujarat  to  Bijaypur  in  Madhya \nPradesh to evacuate LNG from the Dahej terminal. The Dahej\u2013Bijaypur pipeline has increased \nthe  transmission  capacity  along  the  Hazira\u2013Bijaypur\u2013Jadgishpur  corridor  by  23  MMSCMD. \nMoreover, GAIL is now expanding its pipeline network by constructing the Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline \nand  Bijaypur\u2013Kota  pipeline.  The  Dahej\u2013Uran  475  km  pipeline,  which  is  scheduled  to  be \ncompleted  by  December  2006,  will  link  the  two  important  gas  markets  of  Gujarat  and \nMaharashtra; and enable Maharashtra to have access to other gas sources than the currently \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n25 \n\nsole supply from the Bombay high fields, which is decreasing. The Bijaypur\u2013Kota pipeline will be \ncompleted by December 2006 and will supply LNG mainly to Rajasthan.  \n \n8. \nThe  fixed  transmission  charges  and  subsidized  price  of  natural  gas,  which  is  used  as \ninput  in  the  LPG  and  petrochemical  business,  have  contributed  to  GAIL\u2019s  high  profitability. \nDuring  FY2005,  GAIL  exhibited  growth  in  all  its  businesses.  The  sale  of  gas  rose  from  21.0 \nbillion cubic meters in FY2004 to 22.8 billion cubic meters in FY2005. Other petroleum products \nalso  recorded  an  increase  in  sales.  The  company\u2019s  total  revenues  increased  from  Rs122.3 \nbillon  in  FY2004  to  Rs139.1  billion  in  FY2005,  while  its  net  profits  registered  a  slight  increase \nfrom Rs28.1 billion to Rs28.7 billion. With strong operating cash flows and low working capital \nrequirements, GAIL has been able to finance its capital investments through minimal use of debt. \nGAIL\u2019s financial statements are summarized in Table A4.2. \n \n9. \nGoing  forward,  GAIL  plans  to  expand  its  national  gas  transmission  network  and  its \ngrowth in other downstream activities. It will be subject to the recently approved Petroleum and \nNatural  Gas  Regulatory  Board  Bill,  which  allows  open  access  in  transmission  infrastructure. \nAdditional  regasification  capacity  of  PLL  through  the  expansion  of  the  Dahej  terminal  and \nconstruction of the Kochi terminal will increase the volume of its LNG marketing business. Given \nthe  substantial  unmet  demand  for  LNG  in  India  and  price  competitiveness  of  LNG  compared \nwith other more expensive fuels such as naphtha, the risks associated with LNG marketing are \nbelieved to be relatively low over the medium term. Aside from the LNG business, GAIL plans to \nexpand the capacity of its petrochemical complex from 300,000 tons to 450,000 tons by 2007. \nFurthermore,  GAIL,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  GAIL  Global  (Singapore)  Pte.

IOC  refines  and  markets  petroleum  and  its  derivatives.  It  is  currently  India\u2019s  largest \ncompany by sales with consolidated turnover of Rs1.51 trillion and net profits of Rs48.91 billion \nin FY2005. In 2005, IOC was ranked 170th in the Fortune Global 500 listing, the highest ranked \nIndian  company.  It  was  also  the  18th  largest  petroleum  company  in  the  world  and  the  first-\nranked petroleum trading company among the national oil companies in the Asia-Pacific region. \nIOC\u2019s paid up capital as of 31 March 2005 was Rs11.68 billion, of which the Government held \n82%.  IOC  is  listed  on  the  national  and  Mumbai  stock  exchanges.  IOC\u2019s  international  credit \nratings are Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and BB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and its local credit rating by the \nIndia Credit Rating Agency is AAA. \n \n11. \nIOC  and  its  subsidiaries  account  for  56%  market  share  of  petroleum  products  among \npublic sector oil companies, 42% of national refining capacity, and 69% of downstream pipeline \nthroughput capacity. IOC\u2019s group owns and operates 10 of India\u2019s 18 refineries with a combined \nrefining capacity of 54.2 MMTPA. The refinery business registered a record throughput of 36.63 \nMMTPA during FY2005 with capacity utilization rate of 88.6%. All refinery units are accredited \nwith  ISO  9002  and  ISO  14001  certifications.  IOC  owns  and  operates  the  country\u2019s  largest \nnetwork  of  8,892  km  of  crude  oil  and  petroleum  product  pipelines  for  combined  capacity  of \n60.42 MMTPA. Furthermore, IOC operates the largest and widest network of retail outlets in the \ncountry with the sale of 50.13 million tons of petroleum products, and has reached a significant \nmilestone  with  the  commissioning  of  the  company\u2019s  10,000th  petrol  station  in  FY2005. \nRegarding its gas business, IOC has already been marketing 5.26 MMSCMD. In addition to the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\ninvestment  in  PLL,  IOC  along  with  its  subsidiary  Chennai  Petroleum  Corporation  plans  to \ndevelop an LNG import terminal at Ennore near Chennai.  \n \n12. \nLosses  from  the  retail  marketing  business  due  to  government  price  controls  on  LPG, \ndiesel, and other petroleum products have been partly offset by improved refining margins and \nthe stable contribution from its pipeline operations (Table A4.3). An increasing output of refined \nproducts  from  planned  new  capacities  at  a  faster  pace  than  domestic  demand  is  expected  to \nworsen  the  oversupply  situation  and  negatively  affect  the  refining  margin.  However,  IOC  has \ncompetitive advantage over its competitors given that over 67% of its refining capacity is in the \nnorthwest  where  demand  is  relatively  vibrant  and  its  ownership  of  a  downstream  pipeline \nenhances its ability to sell its products. Government ownership, along with IOC\u2019s integrated and \ndiversified  operations  and  its  adequate  financial  profile  are  anticipated  to  mitigate  the  adverse \nimpact on its marketing business if government controls on petroleum retail prices continue. IOC \nhas  set  a  revenue  target  of  $60  billion  by  FY2012  and  plans  to  achieve  this  by  continuing  its \nvertical  integration  strategy  forward  into  petrochemicals  and  backward  into  exploration  and \nproduction of crude oil as well as diversifying its natural gas business.    \n \n\nTable A4.3: Financial Summary of Indian Oil Corporation Limited \n(Rs million) \nFY2003\n\nFY2004\n\nFY2005\n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n  1,010,132 \n     117,312 \n  1,127,444 \n  1,006,191 \n     121,253 \n       66,627 \n\n       1,134,015 \n            56,985 \n       1,191,000 \n       1,055,351 \n          135,649 \n            78,374 \n\nIncome Statement Data \nSales \nOther Income \nTotal Income \nExpenditures \nEBITDA \nNet Profit \nBalance Sheet Data \nCurrent Assets \nFixed Assets and Intangible Assets \nTotal Assets \nCurrent Liabilities \nLoans \nTotal Liabilities \nShareholders' Equity \nRatios \n              11.39 \nEBITDA Margin (%) \n                6.58 \nNet Profit Margin (%) \n                0.78 \nLong-Term Debt to Equity Ratio \n              31.04 \nReturn on Equity (%) \nEBITDA= earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: India Oil Corporation Limited. \n \n\n          278,607 \n          327,706 \n          653,453 \n          203,373 \n          149,461 \n          400,998 \n          252,456 \n\n     273,311 \n     295,269 \n     613,892 \n     197,160 \n     169,428 \n     409,580 \n     204,312 \n\n         10.75 \n           5.91 \n           1.04 \n         32.61 \n\n       1,316,440 \n            53,535 \n       1,369,975 \n       1,261,688 \n          108,287 \n            59,009 \n\n          356,350 \n          377,820 \n          781,780 \n          236,360 \n          203,298 \n          490,214 \n          291,566 \n\n                7.90 \n                4.31 \n                0.87 \n              20.24 \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 May 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \nRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n$0.02 \nRs45 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBPCL \nCSP \nDSCR \nEIA \nEIRR \nEPC \nGAIL \nGDF \nGDFI \nGSPA \nHBJ \nICB \nIHI \nIOC \nJCC \nKfW \nKRL \nLNG \nLPG \nMEF \nMPNG \nONGC \nO&M \nPCG \nPLL \nRasgas II \nSPA \nTCA \n", "bcm \nha \nkm \nMW \nMMBTU \nMMT \nMMTPA \nMMSCMD \ntoe \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited \ncountry strategy and program \ndebt service coverage ratio \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nengineering, procurement, and construction \nGAIL (India) Limited \nGaz de France \nGDF International \ngas sales and purchase agreement \nHazira-Bijaypur-Jadgishpur \ninternational competitive bidding \nIshikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Company Limited \nIndian Oil Corporation Limited \nJapan crude oil cocktail \nKfW Bankengruppe \nKochi Refineries Limited \nliquefied natural gas \nliquefied petroleum gas \nMinistry of Environment and Forests \nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Gas \nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited \noperation and maintenance \npartial credit guarantee \nPetronet LNG Limited \nRas Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company Limited (II) \nsales and purchase agreement \ntime charter agreement \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", "billion cubic meters \nhectare \nkilometer \nmegawatt \nmillion British thermal units \nmillion metric tons \nmillion metric tons per annum \nmillion standard cubic meters per day \nton of oil equivalent \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \nThe fiscal year (FY) ends on 31 March.
