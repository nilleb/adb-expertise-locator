Improving  the  quality\nof  classroom  teaching  is  key  to  improving  the  quality  of\neducation.  At  present,  entry-level  qualifications  for  primary\nteachers are low, and the majority of teachers have little or no\ntraining.  Teacher  absenteeism  is  high,  and  motivation  is  low.\nPoor  teaching  stems  from  lack  of  emphasis  on  training  of\ntraining  curriculum  and\nteachers,  an  unsuitable \nteacher \nteaching methods, and weak management capacity. Adequate\ninstitutional  capacity \nthe  conduct  and\nrequired \nmanagement  of  training,  curriculum  development,  and  design\nlearning  materials.\nand  development  of \nEnhanced  institutional  capacity  will  lead  to  improvements  in\nteaching  skills  and  competencies  of  primary  school  teachers.\nThe  ultimate  result  is  improved  quality  of  primary  school\neducation.\n\nteaching  and \n\nfor \n\nis \n\nClassification\n\nThematic: Human development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\n\fiii\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nis \n\nto  assist \n\nthe  government \n\nin\nThe  Project\u2019s  objective \nimproving the quality and efficiency of basic education through\nbetter  qualified  teachers.

The  project  will  help  build  an  effective  and\nsustainable  system  for  teacher  education  in  the  country,  thereby  filling  a  critical  gap  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  basic  education.  In  the  past,  ADB  provided\nassistance  to  the  Government  under  the  Primary  Education  Development  Project2  (PEDP)  to\nestablish  the  National  Center  for  Education  Development  (NCED)  and  nine  primary  teacher\ntraining  centers  (PTTCs)  for  training  primary  school  teachers.  This  Project  will  build  on  the\ninvestments made through PEDP and strengthen the capacity of these institutions. A Fact-Finding\nMission3  was  undertaken  in  February  2001  and  an  Appraisal  Mission4  was  fielded  in  May  2001.\nThroughout  TA  implementation  and  the  project  processing  phase,  there  was  close  coordination\nand  consultations  with  the  government  officials  at  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES),\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  National  Planning  Commission  (NPC),  government  agencies,  aid\nagencies, and other stakeholders to forge a consensus on project objectives and modalities. The\nproject framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Social Context\n\n3.\nNepal faces formidable challenges in the economic and social spheres. Despite a series of\ndevelopment plans and assistance from international aid agencies, Nepal\u2019s economic growth has\nbarely  kept  pace  with  its  expanding  population.  Growth  in  total  output,  as  measured  by  gross\ndomestic product (GDP) at factor cost, reached 6.4 percent, the highest annual growth rate in six\nyears  and  over  the  6  percent  growth  rate  projected  under  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY1998-\nFY2002). The higher overall growth was led by a recovery in agriculture, which grew by 5.0 percent\ncompared with 2.7 percent growth in FY1999.\n\n4.\nHowever,  structural  transformation  remains  slow.  While  the  share  of  agriculture  in  GDP\ndropped  from  63  percent in the 1970s to 40 percent in FY2000, much of this comes from a shift\ninto services. The value of production from services was nearly equal to that of agriculture. Trade,\nrestaurants,  and  hotels\u2014an  industrial  category  strongly  influenced  by  the  level  of  tourism\u2014were\nthe largest service producers, making up more than 12.2 percent of GDP in FY2000. After a surge\n                                                          \n1 TA 3217-NEP: Basic Education Project, for $600,000, approved on 5 July 1999.\n2  Loan 1141-NEP(SF): Primary Education Development Project, for $19.5 million, approved on 5 December 1991.\n3 The  Mission  comprised  S.  Brar,  Education  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  L.  Gutierrez,  Project  Economist;  J.  R.  Giri,\nInstitutional Capacity Building Specialist; G. Shrestha, Teacher Training and Curriculum Development Specialist; and\nB.  Thapa,  Financial  Analyst.  E.  Haugh  Jr,  Manager  AWEH,  provided  guidance  to  the  Mission.  The  Mission  was\nassisted by K.R. Pandey, Project Implementation Officer, Nepal Resident Mission.\n\n4 The  Mission  comprised  S.  Brar,  Education  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  L.  Gutierrez,  Project  Economist;  C.\nVandenabeele,  Legal  Counsel;  and  A.  Rorris,  Financial  Analyst.  The  Mission  was  assisted  by  K.R.  Pandey,  Project\nImplementation Officer, Nepal Resident Mission.\n\n\f2\n\nin the 1980s, industrial expansion tapered off in the 1990s with industry\u2019s share of GDP hovering\naround the 20 percent range, compared with 13 percent in FY1975-FY1979.\n\n5.\nDevelopment expenditures rose by 16.1 percent in FY2000, a significant improvement over\nthe previous year but fell short of the 20 percent envisaged in the budget. Foreign grants and loans\naccounted for about 50 percent of development expenditures in FY2000. Dependence on foreign\nresources is likely to continue with foreign loans and grants again expected to cover 55 percent of\nbudgeted development expenditures in FY2001.\n\n6.\nSocial  indicators  in  Nepal  are  weak.  The  total  fertility  rate  remains  high  at  4.6.  The  infant\nmortality rate at 75 per 1,000 live births is high compared with that in countries at similar income\nlevels.  About  71  percent  of  the  population  have  access  to  safe  water  and  only  16  percent  of\nhouseholds have sanitary facilities. Access to education also remains low. About 50 percent of the\npopulation above 6 years is still illiterate and about 30 percent of children of school age are outside\nschool.  The  major  challenge  facing  Nepal  is  to  overcome  this  vicious  cycle  of  poverty  and  low\nhuman  development.  Consequently,  special  policy  efforts  and  stepped-up  investments  are\nnecessary  to  provide  universal  access  to  basic  human  development  services,  particularly  basic\neducation and health.\n\n2. \n\nThe Education Sector\n\n7.\nSince  the  establishment  of  the  formal  school  system  in  1950,  school  education  has\nundergone continuous change in response to the evolving socioeconomic situation in the country.\nFrom  1951  to  1971,  primary  education  comprised  five  years  of  schooling.  In  1971,  with  the\nimplementation  of  a  national  education  system  plan,  this  cycle  was  reduced  to  three  years.  In\n1981,  the  five-year  cycle  of  primary  schooling  was  restored.  Similarly,  the  structure  of  secondary\neducation changed from the previous three years (grades 8-10) to the current five years (grades 6-\n10). Grades 6-8, though currently part of secondary education, continue to be referred to as lower\nsecondary. Even now, there is some debate on the need for structural changes in the system. But\ndespite the debate, some basic issues in the sector remain constant. A synopsis of the institutional\nsetup and issues in school education, particularly basic education, is given here.\n\na.\n\nStructure\n\n8.\nThe  education  system  in  Nepal  consists  of  five  years  of  primary  education,  three  years\n(grades 6-8) of lower secondary education, and two years (grades 9-10) of secondary education.\nGrades  11-12  are  currently  part  of  tertiary  education.  The  normal  manner  of  creating  secondary\nschools is by steadily upgrading existing primary schools. Therefore, most schools that are referred\nto as secondary schools have classes from grades 1 to 10. Some have a kindergarten as well. A\nfew secondary schools also have grades 11 and 12. A school-leaving certificate (SLC) is awarded\nby examination at the end of grade 10. The certificate entitles one to entry into the tertiary level of\neducation that provides for three possible levels of qualifications: a certificate level, diploma level,\nand  a  university  degree.  Some  thought  is  being  given  to  restructuring  of  the  education  sector  by\nintegrating  grades  6-8  into  primary  education  and  grades  11  and  12  into  secondary  education.\nHowever, no time frame for this restructuring has been set.\n\n9.\nThe  network  of  schools  in  Nepal  has  expanded  considerably,  particularly  at  the  primary\nschool level. The number of primary schools grew from about 7,256 in 1971 to 23,885 in 1998/99\nand the number of primary school teachers from 27,805 in 1981 to about 91,878 in 1998/99. There\nare  about  6,617  lower  secondary  schools  and  3,624  secondary  schools.  The  teachers  in  these\nschools  number  about  22,000  and  16,600,  respectively.  Student  enrollment  grew  rapidly  at  an\n\n\f3\n\nannual  rate  of  above  20  percent  at  all  levels  of  school  education  between  1950/51  and  1970/71.\nHowever,  annual  growth  rates  declined  to  3  percent,  7.4  percent,  and  3.9  percent,  respectively,\nbetween 1990 and 1997.\n\nb.\n\nAdministration\n\n10.\nIn the past, the policy formulation and administrative responsibility for school education lay\nwith  MOES.  However,  with  increasing  external  inputs  into  school  education,  particularly  basic\neducation,  the  need  to  separate  the  policy  formulation  and  implementation  functions  was  felt.\nConsequently, the Department of Education (DOE) was created in 1999 with overall responsibility\nfor  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  primary  and  secondary  education  programs.  DOE  is\nheaded by a director general vested with full administrative and financial responsibility. There is a\nregional  education  directorate  for  each  of  the  five  development  regions.  Under  the  regional\neducation directorates are the district education offices catering to 75 districts. They are headed by\nthe  district  education  officers  (DEOs)  who  are  responsible  for  planning  and  supervising  school\neducation  at  the  district  level.  At  the  cutting  edge,  school  management  committees,  constituted\naccording  to  education  regulations  of  MOES,  are  responsible  for  the  overall  functioning  of  the\nschool.  Grades  11  and  12  are  administered  by  the  Higher  Secondary  Education  Board.  An\norganogram depicting the administrative structure of MOES and its line agencies is in Appendix 2.\n\nc.\n\nTeacher Training\n\n11.\nIn  an  evolving  educational  administration  setup,  some  ambiguities  and  overlapping  of\nresponsibilities  remain  among  the  different  government  agencies  and  institutions.  This  is\nparticularly true in the area of teacher training. At present the following sources provide preservice\ntraining to primary school teachers: (i) private accredited training institutions that offer a 10-month\ncomprehensive training package, (ii) faculty of education (FOE) of Tribhuvan University that offers\na certificate course in education, and (iii) some higher secondary schools (HSSs) that offer courses\nin  the  education  stream.  However,  the  continued  intake  of  untrained  teachers  has  led  to  a  low\ndemand  for  preservice  training.  As  a  result,  many  private  providers  have  discontinued  the\ncomprehensive  preservice  training  package.  The  quality  of  education  also  remains  a  concern.  In\n1999,  only  21  percent  of  students  from  the  education  stream  of  HSSs  passed  the  12th  grade\nexamination. NCED is the apex body for training of primary school teachers. Nine primary teacher\ntraining  centers  (PTTCs)  are  mandated  to  provide  in-service  training  to  primary  school  teachers.\nDue  to  the  large  numbers  of  untrained  teachers  entering  the  teaching  force,  a  disproportionate\nshare  of  the  burden  for  teacher  training  has  fallen  on  NCED  and  PTTCs  by  way  of  in-service\ntraining to raise the competencies of the teachers.\n\n12.\nTeacher training is also characterized by differing views on optimum training requirements.\nUnder the multisource-funded Basic Primary Education Development Project II (BPEP II), resource\ncenters  (RCs)  give  10-day  recurrent  training.  BPEP  II  has  also  partially  financed  the  2.5-month\nbasic training package offered by PTTCs. Only recently has consensus begun to emerge that ad\nhoc training inputs are not having the desired impact in improving classroom teaching and that a\nconcerted and well-coordinated effort is required to upgrade teacher competencies and skills. This\nincludes  revisiting  the  content  and  duration  of  training.  MOES  has  recommended  a  10-month\ntraining currently designed to be imparted through four packages, each lasting for 2.5 months. This\ntraining  is  being  implemented  to  the  extent  possible,  given  the  limited  capacity  of  the  training\ninstitutions. The PTTCs are offering the basic package, DEC is providing content-based training in\nthe  second  and  third  packages  through  radio  broadcasts,  and  the  PTTCs  are  offering  the  fourth\npackage for a very limited number of candidates.\n\n\f4\n\nd.\n\nFinancing\n\n13.\nReflecting the Government\u2019s commitment to improving the quality of education, government\nbudgetary allocations for education as a percentage of the total budget have risen from an average\n10  percent  between  1985  and  1990  to  an  average  of  approximately  13  percent  in  the  1990s.  In\nFY2000, 13.2 percent of the total budgetary expenditure was allocated for education. It amounted\nto 3.2 percent of GDP. In the education sector, primary education accounted for 55 percent of the\neducation  budget,  followed  by  secondary  education  (20  percent),  and  higher  education  (19\npercent).  The  remaining  5  percent  went  to  other  categories  such  as  educational  administration,\ntechnical  and  vocational  education,  and  other  smaller  programs.  In  keeping  with  the  goal  of\nuniversalizing primary education and the heightened external inputs in the subsector, government\nallocations for primary education, as a percentage of the total education budget, showed a sharp\nincrease from about 49 percent in FY1995 to 55 percent in FY2000.\n\n14.\nIn 1975, the Government made primary education up to grade 3 free and compulsory. With\nthe  restructuring  of  the  subsector,  education  has  been  free  up  to  grade  5  since  1981,  with  the\noperating costs borne entirely by the government. Teacher salaries account for 95 percent of the\nexpenditures  on  primary  education.  Reliance  on  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  has\ngrown sharply. In 1991, external assistance was less than 10 percent of the total education budget.\nBy 1995 it had increased to 25 percent. In FY2000, the education sector accounted for 10 percent\nof all external assistance to Nepal.\n\n3.\n\nKey Issues in Basic Education\n\na.\n\nEquity and Access\n\n15.\nAccess to basic education in Nepal has improved significantly in the last two decades. The\nGovernment has been able to provide a reasonable network of schools, with more than 88 percent\nof the population having a primary school within 30 minutes walking distance from their residence.\nIn the last decade, enrollment in basic education increased from 2.88 million in 1991 to 3.46 million\nin 1997. The number of schools increased from 18,694 to 23,284 during the same period. Primary\nschool  teachers  increased  from  74,  495  to  91,464.  Literacy  rates  rose  by  300  percent  between\n1971 and 1991. Nonetheless, effective access to basic education is far from universal or equitable.\nAbout 50 percent of the children in the 6+ years age group are still illiterate and about 30 percent of\neligible children are still not enrolled in school. Most of the out-of-school children are from poor and\ndisadvantaged families living in remote areas. Girls are disproportionately represented among the\nout-of-school children.\n\n16.\nThe  gross  enrollment  ratio  is  124  percent  at  primary  level,  but  the  net  enrollment  ratio  is\nonly  71  percent.  The  gross  enrollment  ratio  at  the  lower  secondary  level  is  only  53  percent\nwhereas  the  net  enrollment  ratio  for  lower  secondary  and  secondary  level  is  31  percent  and  20\npercent,  respectively.  There  are  considerable  variations  by  sex,  social  and  income  groups,  and\nregion.  Girls  constitute  only  41  percent  of  total  primary  enrollment  and  38  percent  of  lower\nsecondary enrollment. Gaps in enrollment between the poor and the non-poor are also significant.\nThe Nepal Living Standards Survey shows that children from the highest income quintile are twice\nas likely to be enrolled in primary school than those from the lowest quintile.\n\n17.\nParticipation  rates  also  differ  widely  across  the  ecological  and  development  regions,  with\npeople  living  in  the  mountainous  belt  and  the  far-western  region  being  the  most  disadvantaged.\nThe net enrollment ratio ranges from 58 percent in the eastern region to 77 percent in the western\n\n\f5\n\nregion.  Similarly,  girls\u2019  enrollment  is  lowest  in  the  eastern  region  (26  percent)  and  highest  in  the\nwestern region (43 percent).\n\nb.\n\nQuality\n\n18.\nLow  internal  efficiency  and  poor  quality  further  compound  the  problems  of  equity  and\naccess.    The  quality  of  basic  education  remains  a  major  cause  of  concern  due  to  the  internal\ninefficiency  of  the  primary  school  system  evident  in  high  levels  of  dropout  and  grade  repetition.\nIndicators of poor quality include high-grade repetition rates, low rates of transition to higher levels\nof  education,  and  low  student  learning  outcomes.  The  incidence  of  grade  repetition  is  very  high\namong first graders and fifth graders. MOES estimates from 1996 show that 40 percent of children\nenrolled  in  grade  1  repeat,  and  only  37  percent  graduate  to  grade  2.  Repetition  rates  average\napproximately 20 percent at each grade level. Dropout rates are high: 23 percent drop out of grade\n1  and  15  percent  dropout  of  grade  5.  Underage  enrollments  in  grade  1  and  the  generally  poor\nschool and classroom environment account for the high dropout rates. Girls and children from low-\nincome  families  are  more  likely  to  drop  out.  High  repetition  and  dropout  rates  waste  the  scarce\nresources available for primary education.\n\n19.\nStudent  learning  outcomes  at  both  the  primary  and  the  secondary  level  are  considered\nunsatisfactory. A national study of grade 3 and grade 5 students shows that the achievement levels\nare  generally  low  in  the  three  core  subjects\u2014Nepali,  mathematics,  and  social  studies.  Only  75\npercent  of students in grade  8  receive passing marks in examinations.  Again, learning outcomes\nfor  girls  are  poorer.  These  low  outcomes  result  from  inequitable  access  to  quality  education,\nuncongenial learning environment, inadequately trained and poorly motivated teachers, and lack of\nquality learning materials.\n\nc.\n\nTeacher Training\n\nThe  overall  competencies  and  qualifications  of  primary  school  teachers  are  considered\n20.\ninadequate.  The  entry-level  qualification  for  primary  school  teaching  is  grade  10.  A  10-month\npreservice  training  is  recommended,  but  is  not  a  mandatory  requirement  for  recruitment  of\nteachers.  An  ad  hoc  approach  to  teacher  training  has  resulted  in  a  teaching  force  with  diverse\nlevels  of  training.  Of  the  approximately  90,000  primary  school  teachers  in  the  country,\napproximately  32,000  teachers  have  no  training  of  any  kind,  and  only  156  teachers  have  gone\nthrough the 10-month training package. The entry of large numbers into the teaching force without\nany preservice training places a heavy demand for in-service training on the limited capacity and\nscarce resources of NCED and the PTTCs. The poor performance of teachers in basic education is\na  key  constraint  to  improving  the  quality  of  education.  Teacher  absenteeism  is  high,  reflecting\nweak school supervision and lack of community participation. The problem is compounded by lack\nof a satisfactory system of regular preservice and in-service training in the country. Improving the\nquality of teaching is central to Nepal\u2019s education reform efforts.   \n\n21.\nInstitutional capacity for policy planning and management of basic education in general is\nlimited.  This  is  being  addressed  through  BPEP  II.  However,  teacher  training  support  for  basic\neducation  has  been  addressed  in  a  very  limited  way.  Even  though  the  program  implementation\nplan  of  BPEP  II  has  spelled  out  the  need  for  long-term  training,  given  the  very  large  number  of\nteachers with no or little training, BPEP II focused on providing two-weeks recurrent training.5 The\nGovernment holds the view that given the low entry-level qualifications of primary school teachers,\n\n                                                          \n5  BPEP II sources are also providing provisional finance for the basic package of 2.5 months, pending the outcome of\n\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance for teacher training.\n\n\f6\n\na  10-month  training  package  is  essential  for  improving  teacher  competencies.  There  is  a  strong\nrationale  for  creating  a  system  for  long-term,  regular  teacher  education  programs.  This  requires\nconcerted support for strengthening institutional capacity to take on the increased responsibility for\ndesign and delivery of teacher training. In the past, ADB assisted the Government through PEDP\n(footnote  2)  for  infrastructure  support  for  NCED  and  nine  PTTCs.  These  institutions  need\nconsiderable  strengthening  to  effectively  carry  out  their  mandate  for  teacher  training.  They  need\nadequate  and  effective  linkages  with  departments  and  agencies  of  MOES  that  are  currently\ninvolved in training primary school teachers under the BPEP II program with the goal of integrating\nall these training activities under the umbrella of NCED and the PTTCs.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nThe  Government  has  consistently  emphasized  the  importance  of  teacher  training  as  a\n22.\nmajor strategy for improving the quality of school education. The National Education Commission\nand official documents emphasize preservice training. References to teacher training are made in\nvarious official documents, but in the absence of a single comprehensive source of policies related\nto teacher recruitment and training, implementation of these policies remains haphazard and many\nof  the  Government\u2019s  avowed  intentions  remain  unfulfilled.  For  instance,  even  though  the\nGovernment  has  stipulated  that  no  untrained  teachers  will  be  recruited,  in  effect,  untrained\nteachers continue to be recruited. This places a large burden on the limited institutional capacity for\nteacher training and additional in-service training. Besides, the lack of a clear-cut policy for teacher\ntraining and recruitment not only has swelled the ranks of untrained primary teachers; it also has\nacted  as  a  disincentive  for  teachers  to  undergo  preservice  training.  The  reduced  demand  for\npreservice training, in turn, resulted in its discontinuation by private providers.\n\n23.\nThe  emphasis  of  the  five-year  development  plans  on  in-service  training  is  an  inadequate\nresponse  to  raising  teacher  competencies.  Emphasis  on  in-service  training  without  concurrent\nemphasis on preservice training has resulted in a perennial stock of untrained teachers in primary\nschools. The lack of an incentive package and promotional avenues acts as a further disincentive\nfor teachers to undergo training. Given the low entry-level educational qualifications of teachers, a\nwell-designed preservice training package that emphasizes both content and pedagogical skills is\nnecessary to ensure improved classroom teaching.\n\n24.\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  making  the  10-month  teacher  training  mandatory  for  all\nnew  and  untrained  permanent  teachers,  with  some  flexibility  for  teachers  who  have  more  than\nthree  years  teaching  experience.  However,  the  institutional  capacity  for  implementing  these\npolicies remains weak and provision of training remains an ad hoc process.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nExternal assistance to the education sector in Nepal is substantial and has been increasing\n25.\nover  the  years.  The  proportion  of  external  assistance  in  total  education  expenditures  increased\nfrom  7.2  percent  in  FY1992  to  25.4  percent  in  FY1995  as  a  result  of  considerable  aid  agency\nactivity  in  the  education  sector  in  the  last  decade.  The  relatively  high  illiteracy  rates  and  the\nemphasis on universal primary education have focused aid agency interest on basic education.\n\n26.\nADB and the World Bank are the major lenders in the education sector. ADB has provided\nfive loans totaling $56.1 million and 11 TA grants totaling $5.1 million. This assistance has focused\non primary education (mainly on a long-term teacher training program), secondary education, and\ntechnical and vocational training. The World Bank has financed six projects in primary education,\nhigher  education,  and  technical  and  vocational  training.  The  major  bilateral  agencies  providing\n\n\f7\n\ngrants  for  the  education  sector  are  the  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  (Danida),\nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  European  Union,\nFinland,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development,\nSwiss  Development  Corporation,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  World  Food\nProgram. Major interventions in the school sector in the last decade are as follows:\n\n \n\n1.\n\n(i)\n\nBasic Education\n\nA  multisource-assisted6  Basic  and  Primary  Education  Project  was  implemented  in\n1992\u20131999 with the objective of increasing access to basic and primary education,\nimproving the quality of basic education, and enhancing management efficiency. A\nsecond phase, BPEP II, is being implemented. A consortium of sources7 is providing\nassistance  of  $102.5  million  through  a  funding  mechanism  called  the  \u201cbasket\napproach.\u201d  ADB  did  not  join  this  consortium  because  it  already  had  two  ongoing\nprojects  in  education.  There  was  also  a  technical  difficulty  with  the  approach\nbecause  of  the  possible  dilution  of  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures.  The  focus  of\nBPEP II is on improving access, rates of retention, and learning achievements; and\nbuilding the capacity to plan, manage, and deliver education services. The objective\nof the program is to strengthen institutional capacity at national, district, and school\nlevels  to  deliver  more  efficient  and  better  quality  basic  and  primary  education\nservices,  thereby  raising  learning  achievement  and  increasing  equitable  access,\nespecially for girls and other socially disadvantaged groups. JICA and UNICEF are\nsupporting this program outside the basket, in the area of school construction, early\nchildhood development, and out-of-school programs.\n\nADB supported the Primary Education Development Project (footnote 2) with a loan\nof  $19.5  million.  The  Government  of  Norway  provided  a  grant  of  $1.4  million\nequivalent for academic consulting services and fellowship training. The objective of\nPEDP  was  to  assist  the  Government  in  improving  the  quality  of  and  access  to\nprimary  education,  with  focus  on  teacher  training.  A  major  outcome  of  PEDP  was\nthe  establishment  of  NCED  and  nine  PTTCs.  In  the  context  of  the  then  prevailing\nteacher  training  philosophies,  the  project  also  (a)  supported  the development  of\nteacher  training  curricula  and  teaching  materials,  (b)  supported  programs  for\nmanagement  personnel  in  primary  education  and  for  teacher  trainers,  (c)  assisted\nthe Faculty of Education of Tribhuvan University to prepare qualified manpower for\nprimary  education  in  Nepal,  (d)  assisted  the  Government  to  analyze  and  develop\npolicy  options  for  the  future  delivery  of  preservice  training  for  primary  school\nteachers,  and  (e)  constructed  and  rehabilitated  about  1,500  primary  schools  in\nunderserved areas. The ADB loan closed in March 2000.\n\nSecondary Education\n\n(ii)\n\n2.\n\n(i)\n\nADB  provided  support  for  the  Secondary  Education  Development  Project8  (SEDP)\nwith a loan of $12.6 million against a total project cost of $15.8 million. The project\ncomponents  included  (a)  curriculum  and  textbook  development;  (b) in-service\ntraining  for secondary school teachers; (c) examination reform; (d) improvement of\nscience  facilities  in  selected  HSSs;  (e)  provision  of  science  equipment,  learning\n\n                                                          \n6 Danida, the Government of Japan, UNICEF, and World Bank.\n7  Danida,  European  Union,  Department  for  International  Development  Cooperation  (formerly  Finnish  International\n\nDevelopment Agency, [FINNIDA]), Norwegian Agency for Development, and World Bank.\n\n8 Loan 1196-NEP (SF): Secondary Education Development Project, for $12.6 million, approved on 24 November 1992.\n\n\f8\n\nmaterials,  and  library  books  to  1,000  secondary  schools;  and  (f) improved\nmanagement  and  planning.  DFID  provided  an  additional  $8.8  million  for  staff\ndevelopment,  consulting  services,  research,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation\n(BME). The ADB loan closed in June 2000. DFID financial support continues and is\nlikely to continue until June 2002.\n\n27.\nThese  interventions  have  contributed  to  significant  additions  to  and  improvements  in\ninfrastructure  and  improved  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of  education.  The\ninterventions have also contributed to quantitative gains in enrollment over the years. However, a\ncontinuing  concern \nimprovements\ncommensurate with the inputs. The quality of teaching is cited repeatedly as one of the lingering\ncauses  of  poor  quality  of  education.  Under  PEDP,  ADB  created  the  infrastructure  for  teacher\ntraining that now needs to be strengthened.\n\nlearning  outcomes  have  not  shown \n\nthat  student \n\nis \n\n28.\nIn addition to the proposed project for teacher training, in the current year an ADB TA will\nenable the Government to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the secondary education sector\nso  as  to  identify  issues,  prepare  strategies  for  addressing  these  issues,  and  prepare  detailed\nfinancial  plans  for  the  sector.  This  is  in  keeping  with  the  shift  toward  broader,  more  holistic\nsubsector-wide  interventions  in  the  education  sector  in  Nepal.  The  benefits  from  this  approach\ninclude  integrated  planning,  coordinated  interventions  for  optimum  impact,  and  efficient  resource\nallocation and management.\n\n3.\n\nAid Coordination\n\nThe Government is currently implementing BPEP II which is jointly funded by a consortium\n29.\nof  aid  agencies  using  the  basket  approach.  BPEP  II  envisions  comprehensive  inputs  into  basic\neducation. Any additional inputs that have an impact on basic education need to be carefully and\nclosely coordinated with BPEP II. Throughout the implementation of ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA,\nclose coordination was maintained with the BPEP sources and the design of the proposed Project\ntook  into  account  the  linkages  that  are  necessary  for  coordination  of  activities  to  ensure\ncomplementarity  of  objectives.  DOE  is  responsible,  through  the  DEOs,  for  preparing  annual\neducation plans, selecting teachers for training, supervising teachers, as well as for administrative\nmatters affecting both teachers and schools. The DEOS also maintain liaison with the RCs that are\ncurrently  responsible  for  the  two-week  recurrent  teacher  training  provided  under  BPEP  II.  The\nProject,  therefore,  envisions  NCED  to  maintain  close  links  with  DOE  and  the  PTTCs  to  maintain\nclose links with DEOs and, through DEOs, with RCs, in selecting teachers, and for follow-up and\nsupervision. This will be done through the establishment of coordination committees. DOE, DEO,\nand  RC  personnel  will  receive  training  at  NCED  and  PTTCs.  To  the  extent  possible,  ADB  will\nsynchronize the timing of the teacher education policy reviews with the BPEP II review missions.\nADB will, however, participate in the joint aid review missions of BPEP II, particularly the planning\nexercise related to teacher training and management.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nExternal  assistance  to  education  has  provided  valuable  lessons  for  future  interventions\n30.\nincluding  this  Project.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  implementing  projects  in  the  sector  indicates  that\ndespite  the  positive  overall  project  impact,  some  areas  need  to  be  strengthened  during  project\ndesign and implementation. A review of the postevaluation reports indicates that\n\n(i) \n\nproject  components  aimed  at  improving  and  strengthening  crucial  educational\ncomponents,  such  as  curriculum  development  and  staff  training,  appear  to  have\n\n\f31.\n\nSome broad lessons learned from interventions in the education sector in Nepal follow:\n\n9\n\nbeen  underemphasized  as  far  as  financial  provisions  were  concerned,  and  the\ndesign of the fellowship input was generally not optimal because this component is\nnormally designed during implementation and not when the projects are prepared;\n\nADB  supervision  was  considered  inadequate  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and\ncomposition of review missions dispatched, the assistance provided in procurement-\nrelated  aspects,  planning  and  implementation  of  fellowship  programs,  and  the\ndevelopment of a satisfactory mechanism for BME;\n\nADB\u2019s approach to institutional capacity building requires a critical review to address\nthe issues related to appropriateness of an organizational structure, staffing pattern,\nand career development and incentive arrangements;\n\nAlthough  BPEP  I  laid  the  foundation  for  efficient  delivery  to  improve  the  quality  of\neducation, it had no substantial achievements in the learning and achievements of\nstudents.  Teacher  performance  was  identified  as  one  of  the  key  areas  for  quality\nimprovement.\n\nInterventions  to  increase  girls\u2019  enrollment  and  retention  by  appointing  female\nteachers,  strengthening \nintegrating  project\nteacher \nmanagement into MOES will not be sustained unless there are clear-cut policies to\nreinforce them.\n\ntraining,  and \n\nin-service \n\nGiven the change in the training requirements from 150 hours to 10 months, PEDP\nshould have been revised to provide adequate academic consulting services during\nthe training period. As a newly created institution, NCED had no consulting services\nsupport during delivery of training. As a result, the poor professional resource base\nproduced  poor-quality  training.  Sustained  ongoing  inputs  are  needed  in  building\nprofessional,  administrative,  and  managerial  capacity  in  institutions  responsible  for\nteacher training. Adequacy, deployment, and quality of consulting services need to\nbe ensured.\n\nConsistent  follow-up,  monitoring,  and  on-site  professional  support  to  teachers  are\nrequired  to  effect  changes  in  classroom  teaching  practices  and  behavior.  Poor\nclassroom  teaching  practices  remain  a  major  deterrent  to  improving  the  quality  of\nschool education.\n\nOne-time,  short-term  training  of  teachers  is  inadequate  to  bring  about  changes  in\nclassroom teaching behavior.\n\nLack  of  a  comprehensive,  coordinated,  and  well-articulated  policy  for  teacher\ntraining  has  resulted  in  the  entry  of  a  large  number  of  untrained  teachers  in  the\nprimary school system.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nInstitutional  coordination  needs  considerable  improvement  to  strengthen  teacher\ntraining.\n\n32.\nThe project preparation stage has taken into account the lessons from past experiences. It\naddresses  the  critical  need  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching  by  designing  an  efficient  and\n\n\f10\n\nsustainable teacher education system. The Project emphasizes institutional capacity building and\nprovides for extensive professional development of NCED and PTTC staff. Institutional capacity will\nbe strengthened by integrating project activities with the day-to-day functioning of the implementing\ninstitutions.  The  functions  of  the  interministerial  steering  committee  have  been  merged  with  the\nprogram  execution  board  of  BPEP  II  to  allow  integrated  planning.  Institutional  linkages  and\ncoordination mechanisms have been created for supervision and follow-up support to teachers. A\ncoordinated  and  well-articulated  policy  for  teacher  training  will  be  developed.  A  list  of  major\nexternal assistance, lessons learned, and how these lessons have been incorporated in the Project\nare in Appendix 3.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s revised education policy calls for ADB to be a stronger advocate of basic education\n33.\nby  undertaking  public  expenditure  reviews  in  the  context  of  country  programming  to  ensure  that\ndeveloping  member  countries  with  low  public  expenditures  on  education  allocate  a  more\nappropriate  share  of  budgetary  resources  to  basic  education,  particularly  for  girls  and  the  poor.\nADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  calls  for  greater  support  to  the  international  development\ngoals  of  (i)  100  percent  enrollment  in  primary  schools  by  2015,  and  (ii)  elimination  of  gender\ndisparities in primary and secondary education by 2005. These are congruent with the global goals\nof  education  for  all.  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  also  calls  for  support  in  providing  basic\nservices,  including  education,  as  a  key  poverty  reduction  measure.    ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  for\neducation  is,  therefore,  a  part  of  its  overall  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  of  which  social\ndevelopment, including human capital development, is a key component.\n\nADB  assistance  to  the  education  sector  in  Nepal  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s\n34.\npriorities on improving access to and the quality of primary, secondary, and nonformal education,\nand will improve human capital development as part of its poverty reduction strategy. While access\nto  primary  education  has  improved  considerably,  the  efficiency  of  grades  1-5  is  low  with  high\nrepetition  and  dropout  rates.  There  are  considerable  disparities  in  access  due  to  gender  and\ngeographic  location.  The  quality  of  education  needs  to  be  improved  through  teacher  training,\ncurriculum development, and better school management, maintenance, and supervision.\n\nIn  the  past  ADB  gave  assistance  for  primary  education,  secondary  education,  and\n35.\nvocational  education  in  Nepal.  In  the  primary  education  subsector,  ADB  has  concentrated  on\nimprovements in teacher training. Over time, ADB\u2019s strategy9 for the education sector in Nepal has\nevolved to emphasize strengthening the investments made during past projects and build on them\nwithin a more holistic, subsector approach. The proposed Project for teacher education has been\nconceived to strengthen the capacity of the teacher training institutions for which ADB had helped\ncreate the infrastructure under PEDP. These institutions will fill a critical gap in the area of teacher\ntraining that will complement the broader support for basic education under BPEP II. In secondary\neducation,  ADB  in  coordination  with  Danida  is  implementing  a  TA  to  devise  a  comprehensive\nstrategy for investment in the subsector.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n36.\nThe need for a coherent teacher training policy was recognized and pursued by PEDP. As\nan  initial  response,  the  Government  adopted  two  policies:  (i)  all  primary  teachers  are  to  hold  at\nleast an SLC pass, and (ii) all primary teachers are required to complete a short-term program of\n\n                                                          \n9 T.A. No. 2421-NEP: Education and Health Sectors Assistance Strategy Study, for $345,000, approved on 13 October\n\n1995.\n\n\f11\n\nin-service training unless they have already been trained. For the longer term, it was emphasized\nthat a carefully conceived strategy was needed to provide (i) basic in-service training to the existing\nbatch of teachers, and (ii) adequate preservice training to new teachers. It was also emphasized\nthat, for the long term, the Government would adopt a policy that will avoid a backlog of untrained\nteachers  indefinitely.  Most  of  these  concerns  remain  valid  to  date  and  it  is  urgent  that  policy\nmeasures for teacher training be strengthened.\n\n37.\nThe Government recognizes the role and importance of teacher education in improving the\nquality  of  education  and  is  strongly  committed  to  the  proposed  Project.  It  has  specifically\nemphasized (i) strengthening the NCED and PTTCs created through PEDP; (ii) developing NCED\nas the apex body for training teachers and educational administrators; (iii) developing the training\nstrategies  to  support  the  achievement  of  BPEP  II  objectives;  (iv)   supporting  private  providers  of\ntraining by providing educational materials, curriculum development, and training the trainers; and\n(v) clearing the backlog of untrained teachers already in service as early as possible.\n\n38.\nA  review  of  progress  under  BPEP  II  indicates  that  a  major  constraint  to  improving  the\nquality  of  basic  education  is  the  quality  of  teaching  itself.  The  current  in-service  training  for\nteachers  is  not  enough  to  translate  into  improved  teaching  practices  in  the  classroom.  The  low-\nlevel  entry  qualifications  for  primary  school  teachers  coupled  with  the  overall  poor  quality  of\neducation  necessitate  a  structured,  well-designed  program  for  both  preservice  and  in-service\nteacher training. However, the large number of untrained teachers already in the system presents\na challenge that needs to be accorded high priority. Consequently, in preparing the Project, policy\ndialogue with the Government has centered on the contribution of the Project to (i) improving the\nquality  and  efficiency  of  basic  education  by  improving  the  skills  and  training  of  primary  school\nteachers;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building  to  take  on  the  responsibility  for  current  and  future\nteacher  training  needs;  and  (iii)  improving  access  for  disadvantaged  groups,  particularly  girls,\nthrough  greater  representation  of  women,  especially  from  disadvantaged  groups,  in  the  teaching\nforce.    In  view  of  the  ongoing  multisource  inputs  in  the  school  sector,  aid  coordination  and\nGovernment policies affecting aid inputs were also discussed.\n\n1. \n\nCoordination of Aid Inputs\n\nGiven the formidable challenge that Nepal faces in achieving the goals of gender parity and\n39.\nincreasing enrollments in primary education, the aid community provides substantial assistance to\nthe  education  sector.  Coordinating  external  assistance  and  dovetailing  it  effectively  into  the\neducation  system  pose  a  challenge.  Extensive  discussions  were  held  with  Government  and  aid\nrepresentatives to ensure that the proposed Project will complement the inputs of BPEP II. Careful\nthought  was  given  to  dovetailing  the  teacher  training  activities  of  BPEP  II  into  the  planned\nexpanded  activities  of  NCED  and  the  PTTCs.  These  institutions  will  also  support  the  RCs\nestablished under BPEP II for giving training and assistance to teachers in schools.\n\n2. \n\nTeacher Recruitment and Training Policy\n\n40.\nIt is agreed that a comprehensive policy framework for teacher training is necessary. Even\nthough the Government has made preservice training mandatory for recruiting new teachers, in the\npast this policy has not been enforced. Continued recruitment of untrained teachers has rendered\nthe policy ineffective and reduced the demand for preservice training while increasing the pressure\non  limited  resources  for  training  teachers  already  in  service.  Strict  enforcement  of  the  policy  is  a\nprerequisite  to  the  establishment  of  a  teacher  training  system.  The  Government  has  included  a\nprovision for mandatory training in the amended Education Act awaiting parliament\u2019s approval.\n\n\f12\n\nGiven the very large number of untrained teachers in the system and the weak emphasis\n41.\non training, teachers are not inclined to undergo training since they see no benefit from it. It was\ntherefore agreed that a system of incentives will be designed to encourage completion of the 10-\nmonth in-service training.\n\n42.\nA teacher recruitment and training policy must also address the issue of service in remote\nand disadvantaged areas. Due to the low level of education in these areas, an adequate number of\nsuitable  local  candidates  are  seldom  available.  Thus  outsiders  are  appointed  to  schools  in  these\nareas, leading to one of the causes of high absenteeism. Concerted efforts will be made to recruit\nmore teachers from disadvantaged groups as well as those from remote and disadvantaged areas.\n\n43.\nGreater  representation  of  women  in  the  teaching  profession  will  be  supported.  It  is  well\ndocumented that in traditional societies, parents are reluctant to send their girls to school with no\nfemale  teachers.  Therefore,  to  bridge  the  enrollment  gap  between  girls  and  boys,  the  ultimate\ntarget  of  recruiting  is  to  increase  women  teachers  to  at  least  50  percent  of  the  teaching  force.\nGiven  the  current  low  levels  of  representation  and  the  low  attrition  rates,  this  target  will  not  be\nachieved for many years to come. The Government has expressed its commitment to the goal of\nincreasing  representation  of  women  teachers  in  the  teaching  force.  This  is  necessary  for  gender\nsensitization as well as for greater visibility and demonstrational effect as role models in a society\nwhere opportunities for women remain limited.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Capacity Building\n\n44.\nThe institutions responsible for training primary school teachers\u2014NCED and the PTTCs\u2014\nrequire  support  to  enhance  their  capacity.  A  key  input  for  effective  capacity  building  is  effective\nleadership. It was, therefore, emphasized that heads of NCED, PTTCs, and DEC must be carefully\nselected and that continuity of personnel in the institutions must be ensured so that training is not\nwasted  on  staff  who  will  later  transfer  to  other  positions  outside  the  training  institutions.  The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  (i)  convert  the  temporary  positions  in  these  institutions  to  permanent\npositions to boost staff commitment and morale, and (ii) devise guidelines for selecting the heads\nof training institutions and provide for stable tenure.\n\n4.\n\nProject Sustainability\n\n45.\nThe  Government  agreed  to  (i)  sustain  the  project  by  providing  adequate  recurrent\nbudgetary  support  for  operation  and  maintenance  for  effective  functioning  of  the  training\ninstitutions; (ii) provide stable tenure for NCED and PTTC personnel; and (iii) emphasize training\nby  making  preservice  training  mandatory,  by  not  recruiting  any  more  untrained  teachers,  and  by\nproviding  for  incentives  for  completing  the  suggested  10-month  training  packages  for  teachers\nalready in service.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n46.\nDespite considerable achievements in expansion, the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness\nof basic education remains low. The poor quality of classroom teaching is one key reason, which is\nmanifested  in  low  student  learning  achievements,  and  high  dropout  and  grade  repetition  rates.  A\nteaching force with little or no training has a major impact on the quality of classroom teaching. It is\nincreasingly  recognized  that  improving  the  quality  of  classroom  teaching  is  key  to  improving  the\n\n\f13\n\nquality  of  education.  At  present,  entry-level  qualifications  for  primary  teachers  are  low  and  most\nteachers have little or no training. Teacher absenteeism is high and motivation is low.\n\n47.\nPoor  teaching  quality  stems  from  lack  of  emphasis  on  training  of  teachers,  an  unsuitable\nteacher training curriculum and teaching methods, and weak management capacity. In view of the\nlow entry-level qualifications of primary school teachers, a well-designed system of preservice and\nin-service training for them is essential. The design of such training systems necessitates adequate\ninstitutional capacity to conduct and manage training, develop curricula, and to design and develop\nteaching  and  learning  materials.  BPEP  II  is  undertaking  large-scale  interventions  to  improve  the\nquality of basic education.\n\n48.\nThe Project provides critical complementary support to BPEP II by addressing the issue of\nteacher quality through comprehensive teacher training. This was not fully addressed by BPEP II\nfor reasons explained in para. 21. It is felt that further neglect of issues related to teacher training is\nlikely to have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the BPEP II inputs. The Project is designed\nto  address  these  issues.  However,  it  is  recognized  that  given  the  limited  emphasis  on  teacher\ntraining so far, the Project has a rationale independent of other quality improvement inputs into the\nprimary education system.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n49.\nThe Project\u2019s overall sectoral objective is to assist the Government in improving the quality\nand efficiency of and access to basic education through provision of better-qualified teachers. The\nspecific  objectives  are  to  improve  the  quality  and  coverage  of  teacher  training  by  enhancing  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  a  teacher  training  system  that  encompasses  preservice,  in-service,  and\nrecurrent  training  of  primary  teachers  and  to  increase  the  representation  of  disadvantaged\ngroups,10  particularly  females,  in  the  teaching  force.  The  Project\u2019s  objective  will  be  achieved  by\n(i) building  the  capacity  for  policy  making,  planning,  and  managing  teacher  training  programs;\n(ii) enhancing  the  professional  skills  of  teachers  by  training  the  trainers  and  teachers,  and\ndeveloping  the  curriculum  and  materials;  and  (iii)  improving  access  to  basic  education  for\ndisadvantaged  groups,  including  women,  by  encouraging  increased  recruitment  of  teachers  from\nthese  groups;  by  sensitizing  teachers  to  the  needs  of  pupils,  and  by  providing  fellowships  for\npreservice training for prospective teachers from disadvantaged groups, particularly women.\n\n50.\nEven  though  the  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years,  it  envisions  a  system  for\nteacher  training  that  aims  to  clear  the  backlog  of  untrained  teachers  and  provide  preservice  and\nrecurrent training on a continuing and sustained basis.  As a strategic input to improving the quality\nof  basic  education  for  girls  and  other  disadvantaged  groups,  the  Project  also  recommends\nstrategies  for  recruiting  and  training  teachers  from  such  groups.  The  objectives  will  be  achieved\nthrough  the  following  four  components:  (i) building  institutional  capacity  for  delivering  training  for\nprimary school teachers by developing staff skills and improving the facilities of NCED, PTTCs, and\nDEC;  (ii)  developing  teacher  education  curriculum  and  teaching-  learning  materials;  (iii)  training\n\n                                                          \n10 Given the sociocultural nature of disadvantage, the definition of disadvantaged groups remains amorphous.  For the\nsocial impact assessment undertaken for the Project disadvantaged groups are defined as \u201c those oppressed, deprived\nand  downtrodden  people  making  their  living  on  traditional  occupation;  deprived  and  oppressed  because  of  socio-\neconomic  reasons  and  listed  as  such  in  HMG\u2019s  Gazette\u201d  (Manav  Maryada,  HMG  Ministry  of  Local  Development,\nNational Committee for the Development of the Oppressed and the Downtrodden, vol.1, no.1, p.2). However, for the\npurpose of the Teacher Education Project, \u201c disadvantaged groups\u201d means those groups, as may be agreed upon from\ntime  to  time  between  HMGN  and  ADB,  who,  because  of  geographical  or  socio-economic  reasons,  generally  do  not\nhave equal access to opportunities. A non-exhaustive list is at Appendix 10, page 4.\n\n\f14\n\nteachers and educational administrators and managers; and (iv) educating teachers to better serve\nthe needs of the disadvantaged groups and girls.\n\n51.\nThe Project has been designed in a highly participatory manner with the active involvement\nof all the stakeholders: government officials and agencies, aid agencies active in education, non-\ngovernmental  organizations,  parents,  teachers,  and  communities  particularly  in  selected  districts\nwhere  the  majority  population  belongs  to  disadvantaged  groups.  In  particular,  teachers  were\nactively  involved  in  the  teaching  needs  assessment  which  was  based  on  the  curriculum  for  the\nbasic 2.5-month training package. Detailed consultations were also held with the officials at NCED,\nselected  PTTCs,  and  DEC  to  assess  their  existing  capability  and  projected  needs.  The  project\ncomponents are described here (details are in a supplementary appendix).\n\n1.\n\nBuilding  an  Effective  and  Sustainable  System  for  Teacher  Education\n(Component 1)\n\n52.\nThis  component  will  provide  quality  training  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  country  for  qualified\nprimary  school  teachers.  It  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  to  implement  a  comprehensive\nsystem  for  teacher  training.  The  Project  will  do  this  by  supporting  key  training  institutions  like\nNCED, PTTCs, DEC, and other private providers to create a network of institutions that can take\non the responsibility of teacher training in the long term. The technical capacity of the staff will be\nstrengthened  through  training  using  multiple  modalities.  A  detailed  staff  development  plan  is  in\nAppendix  4.  Some  enhancement  of  facilities  will  also  be  supported  to  enable  the  institutions  to\ndischarge  their  roles  effectively.  Support  will  also  be  provided  to  DEC  for  refurbishing  recording\nstudios.  Private  providers  of  teacher  training,  and  higher  secondary  schools  and  faculty  of\neducation campuses providing preservice training will also receive support for training trainers, and\nimproving  instructional  materials.  Specific  inputs  for  institutional  capacity  building  include  the\nfollowing:\n\na.\n\nNCED and PTTCs\n\n53.\nNCED and PTTCs were established to take on the responsibility for training primary school\nteachers. Due to the limited emphasis on teacher training, however, NCED and PTTCs were given\nneither  the  responsibilities  nor  the  inputs  to  enable  them  to  develop  according  to  the  role\nenvisioned for them. NCED and the PTTCs will be strengthened through several measures:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAdministrative  reorganization.  An  assessment  of  staff  needs  indicates  that  NCED\nand  PTTCs  are  operating  below  capacity  and,  even  with  additional  responsibilities\nfor training accruing from the Project, additional staff requirement is minimal. These\ninstitutions, however, have staff posted against temporary positions. The temporary\npositions will be converted into permanent ones. In addition, NCED will be given a\nprocurement  consultant.  The  financial  section  of  NCED  will  be  strengthened  by\nupgrading  the  position  of  the  financial  officer  to  that  of  financial  analyst.  The\nadministrative  structure  of  the  PTTCs  will  be  reorganized  to  strengthen  and\nstreamline their operation.\n\nStaff development. Substantial inputs are needed to upgrade the skills of the staff at\nNCED, the PTTCs, and DEC. Developing staff skills is key to long-term institutional\ncapacity building. The Project will provide, both in-country and international training\nfor master trainers, curriculum and materials developers, and management staff. In-\ncountry training will need 58 person-months of international consultants and 309 of\ndomestic consultants. Included are the services of an adviser who will be based in\n\n\f15\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nNCED to give technical support to the Project. In all, 41 staff members from NCED,\n73  from  PTTC,  and  16  from  DEC  will  benefit  from  international  and  in-house\ntraining.\n\nInfrastructure development. The complex of NCED and that of the PTTCs are new\nand  were  developed  under  the  ADB-financed  PEDP.  The  quality  of  civil  works  is\ngenerally  poor  and  each  complex  requires  some  improvements  and  additions  to\nmake  it  fully  functional.  With  the  increased  responsibility  to  be  vested  on  the\ninstitutions,  certain  additional  facilities  are  considered  essential.  NCED  will  have  a\ntraining resource center with a seating capacity of 30 people. The center will be fully\nequipped  with  training  materials,  reference  books,  nonprint  materials  including\naudiovisual  equipment,  and  a  computer  lab.  NCED  will  also  be  provided  with  a\ndesktop  publishing  facility  to  enable  it  to  produce  and  internally  disseminate\nteaching learning materials. For the training candidates, a hostel for 30 persons with\ndining  facilities  will  be  added  to  the  existing  NCED  complex.  The  shortcomings  of\neach PTTC complex will be identified and rectified. Each PTTC will also have a fully\nequipped multimedia lab with audiovisual equipment and computers.\n\nTeacher  management  information  system.  The  teacher  management  information\nsystem (TMIS) at NCED will be strengthened for improved collection, management,\nand  analysis  of  data  on  teacher  training.  The  TMIS  will  be  linked  to  the  education\nmanagement information system (EMIS) of DOE to allow for coordinated planning,\nmanagement,  review,  and  evaluation  of \ntraining.  PTTCs  will  be\nstrengthened to collect and process data. Concerned staff from NCED and PTTCs\nwill receive training in TMIS.\n\nteacher \n\nb.\n\nTraining Management and Coordination Committee\n\nTo support the above inputs, the capacity to formulate and periodically review the teacher\n54.\neducation  policy  will  also  be  strengthened  by  strengthening  the  training  management  and\ncoordination  committee  (TMCC).  The  Education  Regulations  of  1992  mandates  the  TMCC  to\nreview  the  policy  for  teacher  training  and  recommend  to  the  Government  changes  in  policy.  The\nmembership  of  the  TMCC  will  be  expanded  for  a  broader  representation  of  agencies  concerned\nwith basic education. The reorganization of the TMCC will take place before project implementation\nto  enable  it  to  undertake  some  preparatory  policy-related  activities.  To  facilitate  the  effective\nfunctioning  of  the  TMCC,  NCED  will  serve  as  the  secretariat  with  the  NCED  executive  director\nserving as member secretary. This will ensure close linkages and coordination between the TMCC\nand NCED.\n\nc.\n\nAssistance to Providers of Pre-Service Teacher Training\n\n55.\nAfter  the  backlog  of  untrained  primary  school  teachers  has  been  cleared,  NCED  and\nPTTCs  will  be  responsible  for  in-service  recurrent  training  only.  Preservice  training  will  be  the\nresponsibility  of  private  PTTCs,  HSSs,  and  FOE  campuses.  The  TMCC  has  approved  15  private\nPTTCs.    Another  15  FOE  campuses  and  35  HSSs  will  be  selected  to  give  training.  These\ninstitutions  will  be  accredited  to  attain  the  target  of  trained  preservice  teachers  and  will  assist  in\ntraining untrained in-service teachers. The capacity of the selected institutes will be strengthened\nby  (i) providing  increased  access  to  NCED  and  PTTCs  services,  e.g.,  training  RCs,  media\nlaboratory,  and  TMIS;  (ii)  providing  trainers\u2019  training  to  900  staff  of  these  selected  institutions  to\nenable  the  institutes  to  conduct  both  in-service  and  preservice  teacher  training;  (iii)  providing\n\n\f16\n\nprinted \n(iv)  encouraging participation in training and curriculum-related workshops, seminars, etc.\n\nteaching-learning  materials,  e.g., \n\ntrainers  guides,  resource  materials,  etc.;  and\n\nd.\n\nInstitutional Linkages\n\n56.\nCreating  effective  institutional  linkages  is  an  essential  component  of  capacity  building.  To\noptimize  the  benefits  of  inputs  and  resources,  all  teacher-training  activities  must  be  coordinated\nand  linkages  established  among  institutions  responsible  for  primary  education.  Since  DOE  is\nresponsible  for  administering  primary  education,  the  linkages  between  NCED  and  DOE  will  be\nstrengthened  by  forming  a  coordination  committee  with  representation  from  NCED,  DOE,  DEC,\nand  other  related  agencies  as  NCED  may  consider  appropriate  for  effective  implementation  and\ncoordination. The activities of the concerned agencies will be coordinated by (i) including teacher\ntraining  in  the  district  education  plans;  (ii)  formulating  district  teacher  training  plans  that  will  be\napproved  by  DOE  in  consultation  with  NCED;  (iii)  NCED  providing  professional  support  in  the\ndesign and development of recurrent teacher training packages; (iv) having DEOs provide NCED\nwith  information  needed  for  accrediting  the  recurrent  teacher  training  programs;  (v)  having\nconcerned  staff  members  of  DOE  as  members  of  training  program  and  materials  development\nteams; (vi) having DOE deputize staff and resource persons for training as master trainers and as\nresource  persons  for  the  conduct  of  training;  (vii)  deputizing  teachers,  supervisors,  resource\npersons,  DOE  personnel  as  master  trainers  and  trainers  for  PTTCs;  (viii)   supervising  trained\nteachers  to  assess  and  monitor  posttraining  classroom  behavior;  (ix)    giving  feedback  to  PTTCs\nabout  the  performance  of  trained  teachers  in  the  classroom;  and    (x)  sharing  information  in\nmonitoring and evaluation.\n\n2.\n\nDeveloping  Effective  Teacher  Education  Curriculum  and  Materials\n(Component 2)\n\n57.\nThis component will focus on an improved teacher training curriculum and development of\nteaching learning materials to make training more effective, participatory, activity-based, and linked\nto  school  practices.  The  existing  curriculum  for  teacher  training  has  a  heavy  content  bias.  While\nteachers\u2019  mastery  of  the  subject  matter  needs  to  be  strengthened,  their  pedagogical  skills  also\nneed  to  be  strengthened.  The  national  primary  teacher-training  curriculum  has  been  revised  to\nmeet the goals and objectives of basic education. It incorporates pedagogical skills to improve the\neffectiveness  and  relevance  of  classroom  teaching.  Under  the  TA  to  prepare  for  the  Project,  a\nteacher needs assessment was carried out. The revised curriculum is based on that assessment.\nThe comprehensive in-service training package includes (i) a training curriculum, (ii) trainers\u2019 guide,\n(iii)  training  of  trainers  (TOT)  manual,  (iv) resource  materials  for  trainees,  and  (v)  a  materials\npreparation kit.\n\n58.\nThe  10-month  curriculum  is  split  into  four  packages,  each  lasting  for  2.5  months.  The\ncurriculum  for  the  first  or  the  basic  training  package  was  prepared  and  was  approved  by  the\nTMCC. Packages 2 and 3 of 2.5 months each will be offered by distance mode. To facilitate this\nmode,  the  curriculum  of  the  two  packages  has  been  integrated.  To  improve  the  quality  and\nefficiency of the training programs, DEC staff will receive short-term international training in script\nwriting, and distance education teacher training and management. Package 4 is designed to be an\ninteractive package that gives 40 percent of the time to practice teaching in the classroom. Even\nthough  the  curricula  for  the  integrated  packages  2  and  3  and  package  4  have  been  developed,\nsupporting materials such as the TOT manual, trainers guide, resource material for trainees, etc.,\nwill be developed under the Project. The trainers guides will be pretested and a national workshop\norganized  to  validate  the  training  curricula.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  support  the  preparation  of\nmaterials for cultural and gender sensitization for administrators as well as teachers.\n\n\f17\n\n59.\nUnder  the  project  preparatory  TA,  a  10-month  preservice  curriculum  was  prepared.\nHowever,  UNICEF  also  supported  the  preparation  of  a  preservice  curriculum  of  shorter  duration\nthrough  FOE,  Tribhuvan  University.  NCED  will  synthesize  and  integrate  these  two  curricula.  It  is\nexpected  that  with  the  enhanced  professional  capacity  of  the  institutions  engaged  in  teacher\ntraining, the curriculum will be an evolving one, taking note of, and incorporating newer trends and\nmethodologies based on research and feedback.\n\n3.\n\nProviding Teacher and Management Training (Component 3)\n\n60.\nUnder this component, approximately 32,000 teachers (approximately 38 percent of primary\nschool teachers) that have so far received no training will complete the basic training package of\n2.5 months. Thus, at the end of five years, all primary school teachers will have received the basic\npackage  of  training.  In  addition,  during  the  Project  another  41,000  primary  school  teachers\n(approximately  48  percent)  will  complete  the  integrated  packages  2  and  3,  and  34,000  teachers\n(approximately 40 percent) will complete package 4. During this period, preservice training (of 10-\nmonth  duration  and  following  the  schedule  and  modalities  separately  designed  for  preservice\ntraining) will also be given to approximately 15,000 teachers.\n\n61.\nIn addition, 100 officials and 500 primary school principals will receive management training\nannually. NCED will conduct management and orientation programs for (i) officials of MOES and\naffiliated  agencies,  (ii)  regional  education  directors,  (iii) DEOs,  (iv)  school  supervisors,  and\n(v) primary school headmasters. The Project will assist in building in-house capacity within NCED\nto conduct management training. International and domestic consultants will assist in preparing the\nmanagement training curriculum as well as training materials.\n\n62.\nDue to differing training modules in the past, primary school teachers have received training\nof different duration, lacking consistency. The Project will address this lack and will bring uniformity\nto the level of training the teachers receive. Approximately 9,700 teachers have received 150 hours\nof  training.  They  will  receive  an  additional  180  hours  through  RCs  and  secondary  education\ndevelopment  units  to  bring  them  at  par  with  the  teachers  who  have  received  the  basic  package.\nThere  are  3,200  teachers  who,  in  addition  to  the  basic  package,  have  received  only  package  2\nthrough distance education. The Distance Education Center (DEC) will train these teachers in the\nold  package  3.  In  view  of  their  teaching  experience,  4,300  teachers  aged  above  50  years  will\nreceive shortened training of 2.5 months duration specially designed for the group. All teachers are\nexpected to complete package 1 of training in five years. Training in the integrated packages 2 and\n3 will be completed by the eighth year and package 4 will be completed by the ninth year.\n\n63.\nPTTCs, HSSs, RCs, and secondary education development units will be used to expedite\nthe  training  of  primary  school  teachers.  Mobile  training  units  will  be  used  for  training  in  remote\nareas.  Private  training  institutions  and  university  campuses  will  also  be  strengthened  to  build  the\ncapacity to meet future training needs of the primary school system.\n\n64.\nThe  required  number  of  trainers  will  vary  from  year  to  year.  For  the  basic  package,  the\ntrainers  will  vary  from  249  in  year  4  to  160  in  year  5.  For  package  4,  the  need  for  trainers  will\nincrease gradually from 27 in the first year to 635 in the sixth year. PTTCs will work with a constant\ngroup of 63 trainers. For the rest, trainers from institutions involved with training will be identified.\nThe identified trainers will receive TOT from NCED and PTTCs. TOT packages will include training\nmanuals for the trainers.  At the start of the Project, a group of 12 master trainers will be trained\nlocally.\n\n\f18\n\n4.\n\nEducating  Teachers  to  Better  Serve  the  Needs  of  Girls  and  Other\nDisadvantaged Groups (Component 4)\n\n65.\nThe general issues of enhanced access to and improved quality of education for girls and\nother  disadvantaged  groups  are  being  addressed  through  BPEP  II.  Even  so,  discriminatory\ntreatment  and  lack  of  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  teachers  can  discourage  children  from  coming  to\nschool.  Studies  have  found  that  lack  of  sensitivity  to  the  needs  of  children  from  disadvantaged\ngroups  leads  to  low  enrollment  and  high  dropout  rates  from  such  groups.  Teachers  and\nadministrators  will  be  sensitized  to  the  extent  and  nature  of  discrimination,  and  to  ways  of\nminimizing discrimination and enhancing self-esteem among girls and children from disadvantaged\ngroups. This sensitization element is incorporated in the training curriculum to ensure that it is an\nintegral part of the training of trainers and of teachers and administrators.\n\n66.\nThe representation of females and of other disadvantaged groups needs to be increased.\nAt present, only 22.5 percent of primary school teachers are female. One reason cited for this low\nrepresentation is that the number of candidates available from these groups is not adequate. In the\nabsence  of  a  provision  for  affirmative  action,  the  recruitment  of  females  and  persons  from\ndisadvantaged  groups  cannot  be  mandated  but  can  only  be  encouraged.  To  encourage  female\ncandidates  and  candidates  from  other  disadvantaged  groups  to  enter  the  teaching  force,\nscholarships  for  preservice  training  spread  over  five  years  will  be  given  to  2,500  candidates.\nPreference  will  be  given  to  candidates  from  the  12  districts  identified  as  disadvantaged  because\nover 65 percent of the total population there belong to disadvantaged groups. These districts also\naccount  for  20  percent  of  the  total  population  of  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  country.  The\nGovernment  has  assured  that  priority  will  be  given  to  female  teachers  in  recruiting  for  the\napproximately 3,000 vacancies arising annually mainly due to attrition.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $25.9 million equivalent, of which an estimated\n67.\n$7.2  million,  or  28  percent,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  $1.1  million  interest  on  the\nproposed  loan.

This includes $7.2 million of the foreign currency cost\nand $12.4 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will provide $6.3 million to\nfinance  the  remaining  local  currency  costs.  The  loan  will  be  repayable  over  32  years  including  a\ngrace period of 8 years, with a 1.0 percent interest rate per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter.

MOES  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and\nNCED will be the Implementing Agency. NCED is an agency of the MOES reporting directly to the\nMOES.  The  Project  will  not  have  an  independent  interministerial  project  steering  committee.\nInstead,  the  functions  of  the  steering  committee  will  be  subsumed  with  those  of  the  program\nexecution board of BPEP II. The board is chaired by the Minister of MOES, and the membership\nincludes  high-level  representation  from  NPC,  MOF,  and  concerned  departments  affiliated  with\nMOES. The membership of the program execution board will be expanded to include NCED and\nDEC.  This  arrangement  reflects \nfunding  agency  and  Government  consensus  on  closer\ncoordination  of  the  Project  with  BPEP  II  as  well  as  better  time  management  for  effective\nimplementation.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n70.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  NCED  by  integrating  the  project  activities  within  its\nregular administrative setup. The executive director of the NCED will assume responsibility for the\nProject.  It  is  hoped  that  integrating  the  project  implementation  functions  within  the  regular\nadministrative structure of NCED will lead to a greater sense of ownership as well as strengthening\nof the institutional capacity for program implementation. A part-time procurement consultant will be\nengaged to facilitate the procurement of goods and services under the Project. The position of the\naccounts officer will be upgraded to senior accounts officer to strengthen the accounts section. To\nassist  NCED  in  developing  the  capacity  to  take  on  the  increased  responsibility,  a  chief  technical\nadviser  will  be  appointed  for  a  duration  of  three  years  to  assist  in  strengthening  management\ncapabilities within NCED and to help set in motion a well-managed training schedule.\n\n1.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years  beginning  in  2002  and  will  end  in  2007\n71.\n(Appendix 6). The Government has assured that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will\nbe included in the FY2001/02 budget and thereafter to sustain the project.\n\n2.   \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for\n 72.\nProcurement. Contracts for civil works are not estimated to cost more than $1.0 million equivalent.\nInternational competitive bidding procedures will, therefore, not be necessary. Contracts estimated\nto  cost  $1.0  million  equivalent  or  less  will  be  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The\nprocurement of goods too does not require the use of international competitive bidding procedures.\nMiscellaneous  minor  goods  that  cost  less  than  $500,000  per  contract  will  be  procured  through\ninternational shopping. Minor items costing less than the equivalent of $100,000 per contract may\nbe purchased directly. The tentative procurement packages are shown in Appendix 7.\n\n3.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n73.\nAll  consultants  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for\nengaging domestic consultants. A team of 10 international and 15 domestic consultants, based at\nNCED,  will  assist  in  implementing,  managing,  and  monitoring  project  activities.  A  total  consulting\ninput  of  58  person-months  international,  and  309  domestic  is  planned.  The  inputs  will  help\nstrengthen capacity in NCED, PTTCs, DEC, MOES, and other concerned agencies in a wide range\n\n\f21\n\nof  operational  and  management  areas  such  as  training  methodology,  training  and  materials\ndevelopment, TMIS, monitoring and evaluation, organization management, financial management,\nand different aspects of distance education delivery and management. An international consulting\nfirm  that  will  be  selected  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  will  provide  the  consulting  services.\nIndicative terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 8.\n\n74.\nThe  chief  technical  adviser  will  collect  information  on  and  prepare  a  shortlist  of  suitable\ninstitutions  for  international  training  for  staff  development.  A  technical  committee  headed  by  the\nSecretary of MOES, and with representation from MOF, NCED, DEC, and at least three eminent\nteacher training and management experts will scrutinize the list and make final recommendations,\nwhich  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  for  approval.  Criteria  will  be  devised  for  selecting\ncandidates  and  a  committee  will  be  set  up  to  approve  candidates  according  to  the  criteria.  The\ncriteria  will  specifically  lay  down  preference  guidelines  for  eligible  women  candidates.  Selected\ncandidates  will  be  required  to  sign  a  bond  pledging  service  in  the  institutions  according  to\ngovernment norms.\n\n4.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n75.\nMOES will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and requesting budgetary\nallocations  for  counterpart  funds.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  an  imprest  account  for  the\nProject will be established with the Nepal Rastra Bank. The initial amount will be no more than a\nsix-month  projected  disbursement.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and\nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.  Statement  of  expenditures\n(SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 and to\nliquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines.  MOES  will\ncoordinate the timely release of funds. This is considered essential because project activities will\ntake  place  at  different  locations  and  simple  mechanisms  are  required  to  disburse  small  funds\nquickly  through  decentralized  decision  making  while  maintaining  acceptable  levels  of  financial\ncontrol. The use of the imprest account and SOE procedures will be audited by auditors acceptable\nto the ADB. A separate audit opinion on the use of imprest account and SOE should be included in\nthe annual audit report.\n\n5.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n76.\nThe  Government,  acting  through  MOES,  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to\nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  NCED  will  (i)  maintain  separate\naccounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in\naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB;  and  (iii) submit  to\nADB,  not  later  than  12  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited\naccounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on them.\n\n77.\nMOES, with assistance from NCED, will prepare progress reports at four-month intervals to\nbe submitted to ADB no later than 30 days after the end of each four-month period. The reports will\nbe in a format acceptable to ADB, and will include (i) progress made against established targets,\nincluding  aspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve\nissues;  (iii) compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (iv)  proposed  program  of  activities  to  be  undertaken\nduring  the  next  three  months;  (v)  expected  progress  during  the  succeeding  period;  and\n(vi) maintenance  and  repair  activities  undertaken  on  facilities.    Within  three  months  of  physical\ncompletion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion\nreport on the execution of the Project including costs and compliance with loan covenants.\n\n\f22\n\n6. \n\nMidterm Review of the Project\n\n78.\nThe Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of the Project at the end\nof  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The  review  will  (i)  evaluate  the  project  scope,  design,\nimplementation  arrangements,  and  institutional  processes;  (ii)  identify  and  recommend  changes\nneeded  in  any  of  the  areas  mentioned  in  (i);  (iii)  review  the  teacher  education  policy,  including\nissues related to entry-level qualifications of primary school teachers; (iv) assess the effectiveness\nof  the  Project  in  reducing  the  backlog  of  teachers  to  be  trained;  (v)  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of\nproject  strategies  for  promoting  greater  participation  of  females  and  other  disadvantaged  groups;\n(vi)  assess  the  progress  of  capacity  building  for  NCED,  PTTCs,  and  DEC;  (vii) evaluate  the\ncoordination between the Project and BPEP II; and (viii) evaluate compliance with procedures and\nenforcement of quality control mechanisms for procuring civil works and equipment.\n\n7.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook,  a  shortlist  of\n79.\nverifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation has been selected (Appendix 9). BME comprises\nactivities conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources so as to determine\nwhether the input deliveries for implementing program activities have rendered expected benefits\nto the intended beneficiaries. BME also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between\nthe plan and the execution of a program in using the resources efficiently, so that timely corrections\ncould be made to update the program and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. BME\nwill utilize information from the EMIS and TMIS, annual and semiannual reviews, midterm reviews,\nand periodic evaluations and studies.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n80.\nA review of the environmental implications of the Project showed no adverse environmental\nimpact. The required additional buildings and civil works are limited and do not require any fresh\nacquisition  or  allocation  of  land.  Vacant  land  within  the  existing  complexes  of  NCED  and  the\nPTTCs  will  be  used  for  any  additions  and  improvements  to  the  facilities.  No  resettlement  will  be\ninvolved.  MOES  assured  that  the  site,  design,  construction,  and  operations  for  any  improvement\nmade to the physical facilities under the Project would follow ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for\nSelected Infrastructure Development Projects  and  other  relevant  guidelines.  Recognizing  the  key\nrole education can play in improving environmental awareness among primary school teachers and\nstudents,  environmental  issues  have  been  integrated  into  the  revised  basic  training  curriculum.\nThis  integration  is  expected  to  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  environmental  protection  in  the  long\nterm.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na. \n\nDisadvantaged Groups\n\n81.\nThe  Project  addresses  the  institutional  and  cultural  barriers  precluding  the  participation  of\ngirls  and  children  from  disadvantaged  groups.  The  Project  will  (i)  promote  the  recruitment  and\ntraining over a five-year period of an additional 2,500 teachers belonging to disadvantaged groups\nfrom  12  districts  selected  because  the  majority  of  their  population  (65  percent)  belong  to\ndisadvantaged  groups;  (ii)  emphasize  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  that  preference  be  given  to\n\n\f23\n\nfemale  teachers  in  recruiting  for  fresh  vacancies;  (iii)  give  sensitization  training  for  teachers  and\nadministrators, focusing on the extent and nature of discrimination, ways to minimize discrimination\nand  enhance  self-esteem  among  target  groups;  and  (iv) integrate  sensitization  modules  into  the\nregular training curriculum for administrators and teachers. The social assessment of the Project is\nin Appendix 10.\n\nb.\n\nGender\n\nNepal  ranks  119th  among  143  countries  in  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s\n82.\n(UNDP) 1998 gender development index (GDI), published in 2000. Nepal ranks low in indicators of\nhuman  development  that  have  a  direct  correlation  with  the  status  of  women.  Gender  disparity\npersists in educational attainment, health status, and participation in the decision-making process.\nWomen in Nepal are particularly deprived and severely underprivileged. Gender disparity persists\nin  educational  attainment,  health  status,  and  participation  in  the  decision-making  process.\nDisadvantaged castes and communities show higher levels of gender disparities in education. The\ndisparities  in  literacy  are  significant,  with  literacy  rates  of  52  percent  for  men  and  24  percent  for\nwomen.  The  gender  disparities  are  equally  glaring  among  the  poor,  the  literacy  rates  being  32\npercent for men and only 9 percent for women. While efforts are being made to improve the status\nof  women,  there  are  constitutional  and  legal  obstacles  to  equal  status  for  women.  For  example,\nwomen  are  treated  unequally  under  the  inheritance  laws.  Women  also  suffer  from  trafficking  and\nviolence. While women have made substantial gains in education, and the female literacy rate has\nrisen from 4 percent in 1971 to 24 in 1996, the gender gap in terms of the percentage of graduates\nat  various  educational  levels  is  rising.  The  Government  has  expected  efforts  to  close  the  gender\ngap  as  well  as  to  improve  the  status  of  women  through  various  development  programs.  The\nresults,  however,  are  likely  to  remain  limited  unless  the  gender  bias  in  the  social  system  is\nreduced, if not eliminated.\n\n83.\nThe goal to raise the representation of females among primary school teachers can at best\nbe modest. Out of approximately 90,000 primary school teachers, only 22.5 percent are female. It\nis  estimated  that  each  year  there  will  be  3,000  vacancies  mainly  due  to  attrition.  Even  with\noptimum recruitment of females for these vacancies, gender parity in the teaching force will not be\npossible for another decade. The Project will promote the recruitment of females, particularly from\ndisadvantaged  groups,  by  providing  scholarships  to  2,500  potential  candidates  over  a  five-year\nperiod  to  undergo  preservice  training.  Through  this  intervention,  the  number  of  eligible  female\ncandidates  entering  the  teaching  profession  will  be  increased.  This  also  responds  to  a  felt\ncommunity  need  for  greater  representation  of  females  and  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  teaching\nforce in primary schools.\n\nc.\n\nPoverty\n\nDespite four decades of planned development, Nepal ranks among the poorest countries in\n84.\nthe  world.  Taking  a  broader  view  of  human  deprivation  than  the  simple  income  measure,  Nepal\nranked 144th out of 174 countries in UNDP\u2019s 2000 Human Development Report. An estimated 42\npercent of the country\u2019s population remains below the poverty line. Due to lack of comparable data,\nit  is  difficult  to  assess  the  trends  in  the  poverty  rate  over  time,  but  it  appears  that  there  has  not\nbeen  any  reduction  in  poverty  in  the  last  20  years,  despite  increases  in  life  expectancy.  In  fact,\nindications  are  that,  because  of  the  rising  population,  the  absolute  number  of  the  poor  almost\ndoubled  during  this  period.11  Income  distribution  too  is  becoming  increasingly  unequal  over  time.\nAverage household income widely varies by geographic area and the disparity between urban and\n\n                                                          \n11 Nepal South Center. 1998. Nepal Human Development Report. Kathmandu.\n\n\f24\n\nrural  areas  is  also  large.  Many  factors  have  constrained  the  reduction  of  poverty  and  income\ninequality:  (i) inequitable  land  distribution,  (ii)  caste  and  gender  bias,  and  (iii)  erratic  and  low\neconomic  growth  along  with  high  population  growth.  These  disparities  translate  into  acute\ndisadvantage in access to public services such as education and health that precludes meaningful\nparticipation  of  the  poor  in  the  economic  and  social  spheres.  Despite  300  percent  increase  in\nliteracy during 1971-1991, the literacy rate in Nepal remains at 38 percent. Only 20 percent of the\npoor are literate, compared with 60 percent among the higher income groups.\n\nThe  burden  of  poverty  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  lives  of  children  of  school  age,\n85.\ndepriving them of the opportunity to go to school and forcing them prematurely into labor. Of 6.23\nmillion children aged 5-14 years, an estimated 42 percent (2.6 million) regularly work, and about 21\npercent  either  are  idle  or  work  infrequently.  Only  37  percent  attend  school  and  do  not  work.  The\nnumber  of  working  children  is  higher  among  girls,  estimated  at  48  percent  compared  with  36\npercent for boys. While the proportion of economically active children declined between 1981 and\n1991, boys benefited more than girls did from this transition, as indicated by the increased school\nenrollment of boys. Of all working children, approximately 61 percent go to school.\n\n86.\nPoverty is a major impediment to development. Poverty reduction is, therefore, a key goal\nin the development process. The Ninth Plan proposes poverty reduction through (i) sustained and\nbroad-based  growth,  (ii)  development  of  rural  infrastructure  and  social  priority  sectors,  and\n(iii) specific programs that target the poor. The Government has further reinforced its commitment\nto poverty reduction by mandating the NPC to prepare a poverty reduction strategy paper. All these\nefforts notwithstanding, improving access to basic services such as education and health remains\ncritical to poverty reduction.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nSocioeconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nDemand Analysis\n\nEnrollments  in  primary  schools  have  grown  significantly.  Net  enrollments  at  the  primary\n87.\nlevel are expected to be close to 100 percent by the end of the 12th Plan in 2017. It is important to\nmatch  the  increase  in  enrollments  with  a  well-qualified,  trained,  and  dedicated  teaching  force.\nPresently, of the 85,000 primary school teachers in the country, only 156 teachers have completed\nthe  10-month  training  package  and  32,000  have  no  training  of  any  kind.  According  to  the  social\nassessment  survey  commissioned  during  project  preparation,  parents  noted  the  lack  of  trained\nteachers  and  teachers'  lack  of  cultural  sensitivity.  Large-scale  quality  improvement  interventions\nare  under  way  through  BPEP  II  to  improve  the  quality  of  primary  education  through  improved\nfacilities,  management,  and  administration  of  primary  education.  Teacher  training,  however,  has\nreceived  limited  attention  under  BPEP  II.  In  the  past,  ADB  supported  teacher  training  through\nPEDP by establishing NCED and the PTTCs. Continued support for teacher training will not only fill\na critical gap but also is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of providing continuing support to sustain prior\ninvestments. Besides, teachers are the most critical input in primary education. The importance of\nteacher  quality  can  be  gauged  from  the  fact  that  teacher  salaries  account  for  approximately  95\npercent  of  the  budget  for  primary  education.  Neglecting  issues  of  teacher  quality  results  in  poor\nutilization of scarce resources. The Project will assist the Government in its efforts to improve the\nquality of primary education by focusing on the critical area of teacher quality.\n\n\f25\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n88.\nThe major economic benefits of the Project accrue from its contribution to improvements in\nthe internal efficiency of primary education as reflected in the reduced dropout and repetition rates\nof  primary  school  students,  since  better  qualified  teachers  will  have  greater  knowledge  and\nimproved teaching skills (Appendix 11). The dropout rate will fall from 13 percent to 12.6 percent\nand the repetition rate will decrease from 24.5 percent to 23.3 percent. Improved teacher training\nwill also increase learning and raise achievement levels. This, in turn, will enhance the quality of\nentrants  to  the  labor  force  and,  thereby,  have  a  positive  impact  on  Nepal\u2019s  economy.  Long-term\nbenefits  from  the  Project,  which  have  not  been  quantified,  include  greater  representation  of\nfemales  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  workforce,  and  improved  human  development\nindicators such as reduced fertility rates and improved health outcomes.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n89.\nThe Project is designed to improve the quality of primary education through the supply of\nteachers  with  improved  knowledge  and  teaching  skills.  This  will  result  in  reduced  dropout  and\nrepetition  rates  that  directly  impact  the  less  advantaged  groups.  Improved  quality  of  primary\neducation  will  also  lead  to  increased  enrollments,  which  will  directly  impact  groups  hitherto\nexcluded from participation in education. The Project has also been designed to have direct social\nbenefits on the enrollment and retention of girls and other disadvantaged groups by (i) promoting\nthe recruitment of teachers from these groups; and (ii) incorporating sensitization to the needs of\nchildren  from  disadvantaged  groups,  particularly  girls,  into  the  training  curriculum  for  teachers  as\nwell as administrators.\n\n90.\nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project will be the primary school teachers who will receive\ntraining  and  thus  will  have  upgraded  their  skills.  In  all,  32,000  teachers  will  complete  the  basic\ntraining package, 41,000 will complete the integrated second and third packages, and 34,000 will\ncomplete the entire 10-month training package. Additional 15,000 teachers will receive preservice\ntraining  and  2,500  persons,  from  disadvantaged  groups  will  have  undergone  preservice  training\nwith  incentive  fellowships  under  the  Project.  Preference  will  be  given  to  females  from\ndisadvantaged groups. The real beneficiaries, however, will be (i) the student population in primary\nschools countrywide, current and future, who will benefit from improved quality of teaching, (ii) girls\nand  students \nincreased\nrepresentation  of  women  and  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  primary  school  teaching  force,  and\n(iii) society  at  large  through  a  better  educated  population  and  improved  indicators  of  human\ndevelopment.\n\nfrom  disadvantaged  groups  who  will  continue \n\nto  benefit \n\nfrom \n\nC. \n\nSustainability\n\n91.\nThe  Project  will  generate  minor  continuing  additional  incremental  recurrent  cost  after  the\nproject  period.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  sustain  the  Project  into  the  future  after  its\ncompletion by making the necessary budgetary provisions. The certificate training for all in-service\nteachers will not be completed over the six-year project cycle. Approximately 37,794 teachers will\nreceive training in package 4 over three years and approximately 18,700 will receive training in the\nintegrated packages 2 and 3 through the distance mode. Though an additional $4.5 million will be\nneeded for this purpose over a three-year period, actual additional recurrent cost is minor and the\nGovernment  is  committed  to  making  adequate  budgetary  provision  for  this.  Resources  for\neducation, both from internal as well as external sources, are expected to increase in the years to\ncome.  Besides,  basic  education  is  currently  in  an  expansion  phase.  As  consolidation  begins,\n\n\f26\n\nresource allocation within education will be rationalized. As indicated in para. 13, the Government\u2019s\nbudgetary allocations for education have risen by an average 3 percent since 1990.\n\nD.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n92.\nThe  Government  has  identified  ensuring  access  to  basic  services,  including  basic\neducation, as a key intervention for poverty reduction. The proposed Project has been conceived\nto improve the quality of classroom teaching by assisting the Government in designing long-term\nstrategies  for  teacher  training,  and  strengthening  the  institutional  infrastructure  necessary  to\nsupport  these  strategies.  Improved  quality  of  basic  education  is  expected  to  lead  to  increased\nenrollments and retention and reductions in the dropout rate. Project interventions will reduce the\ndropout  rate  from  13  percent  to  12.5  percent  and  in  the  repetition  rate  from  24.5  to  23  percent.\nThese gains will accrue to children that are currently out of school or vulnerable to grade repetition\nor  dropping  out  of  school.  The  distribution  of  benefits  from  improvements  in  the  quality  of  basic\neducation will be toward children of poor families that are attending school.\n\nThe  Project  will  also  increase  access  to  education  for  women  and  other  disadvantaged\n93.\ngroups by (i) sensitizing the teachers and administrators to the needs of these groups of students,\nand  (ii)  promoting  greater  representation  of  teachers  from  these  groups  in  the  teaching  force  by\nproviding  candidates  with  fellowships  for  preservice  training.  Improved  basic  education  will  also\nlead  to  improved  learning  outcomes,  thereby  producing  a  better  educated  workforce  capable  of\ncontributing meaningfully to the economic and social fabric of society. Hence, the Project will have\na  strong  and  positive,  direct  and  indirect  impact  on  all  children  enrolled  in  primary  schools  but\nparticularly  on  the  poor  and  socially  disadvantaged  groups.  The  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the\nProject is substantial.\n\nE.\n\nRisks\n\nThe  training  system  for  primary  school  teachers  in  Nepal  is  characterized  by  diverse\n94.\ntraining philosophies, curricula, training institutions, as well as lack of a coherent training policy and\nweak  institutional  support.  Pulling  together  these  diverse  threads  to  forge  an  effective,  efficient,\nand sustainable system for teacher training is a challenge with certain inherent risks. Dialogue with\nthe Government and related agencies has focused on issues that could have a negative impact on\nproject outcomes. The following risks are anticipated.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nLack of commitment to enforcing preservice training requirements. Emphasis on in-\nservice  training,  as  opposed  to  preservice  training,  and  the  continued  intake  of\nuntrained teachers into schools make for an unsustainable situation. It is critical that\nthe  Government  manifest  a  strong  commitment  to  enforcing  mandatory  preservice\ntraining.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  TMCC  will  initiate  the  formulation  of  a\ncomprehensive policy for teacher training and set a time frame for its validation by\nthe Government.\n\nLack  of  coordination  among  the  teacher  training  institutions  and  DOE,  DEOs,  and\nRCs in selecting and placing teachers for training. The Project will mitigate this risk\nby  establishing  functional  coordination  committees  at  the  national  and  regional\nlevels.  These  committees  will \nthe\nrepresent \nadministrative offices concerned to ensure that functional coordination mechanisms\nare in place at the start of the project.\n\ninstitutions  and \n\ntraining \n\nthe \n\n\f27\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\nLack of leadership and commitment on the part of heads of institutions. To mitigate\nthis  risk,  criteria  for  selecting  heads  of  NCED  and  PTTCs  will  be  established  in\nconsultation with ADB, and the heads will be appointed for a stable tenure of at least\nthree years.\n\nLack of stable tenure for personnel at the training institutes. To ensure that capacity\nbuilding  inputs  are  fully  utilized  and  a  professional  cadre  of  training  personnel\nemerges, it is necessary that institutional staff strength reflect staff requirements. At\npresent,  NCED  and  the  PTTCs  have  some  temporary  positions.  These  must  be\nconverted to permanent ones to justify investments in upgrading staff skills, some of\nwhich  are  specific  to  institutional  needs.  There  is  a  risk  that  investments  in  staff\ndevelopment could be wasted if staff morale is low due to temporary employment, or\nif staff is moved into other organizations. To mitigate this risk, the Government has\nassured that the temporary positions will be converted to permanent ones.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n95.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n(i) \n\nWithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  following  actions  will  have  been\ntaken:\n\n(a) \n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe program execution board of BPEP II will be expanded to include NCED\nand DEC, and will act as the Steering Committee for the Project;\nMOES  will  expand  the  staff  levels  within  NCED  by  engaging  a  part-time\nprocurement  consultant  for  a  total  of  six  months,  and  by  upgrading  the\nposition of senior accounts assistant to accounts officer;\nNCED  will  establish  a  training  coordination  committee  at  the  national  level\nand  zonal  training  coordination  committees  at  the  PTTC  level,  to  liase  with\nrelevant  agencies  and  officers  regarding  teacher  selection,  training,  and\nsupervision;\nthe PTTCs will, in accordance with guidelines from NCED, select the HSSs\nand university campuses that will offer training;\nMOES  will  establish  a  technical  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of\nMOES,  and  including  representatives  of  MOF,  NCED,  DEC  and  at  least\nthree  eminent \nto  make\nrecommendations for selecting international training institutions, develop the\ncriteria  for  selecting  candidates  for  international  training,  and  oversee  the\nselection of candidates for such training.

Agriculture  contributes  41  percent  to  the  gross  domestic\nproduct  (GDP)  and  employs  81  percent  of  the  labor  force.  The  industry  sector  comprises  small\nfirms  producing  consumer  goods.  Industry,  mining,  power,  and  construction  together  employ  5\npercent of the labor force. Trade, tourism, transport, communication, finance, and social services\nprovide work to the remaining 14 percent of the labor force. Most people are self-employed, with\nfemales  (92  percent)  being  more  likely  to  be  so  than  men  (76  percent).  The  major  exports  are\ncarpets and garments. India is the largest trading partner, with exports comprising mainly primary\nproducts. During the Eighth Plan Period, 1992-1997, GDP grew at the rate of 4.9 percent annually.\nPer capita income, currently estimated at $220, grew 2.9 percent per year during the same period.\nThe  sectoral  distribution  of  Nepal\u2019s  GDP  shows  a  gradual  shift  from  primary  production  to\nsecondary and tertiary production, and indicates a future need for more educated people.\n\n2. \nNepal  ranks  among  the  world\u2019s  poorest  countries.  Forty-two  percent  of  the  Nepali\npopulation continues to live below the poverty line. The United Nations Development Programme\u2019s\nbroader  measure  of  development,  the  human  development  index,  ranks  Nepal  144th  out  of  174\ncountries.  Large  disparities  persist  across  regions  and  socioeconomic  groups.  The  1991  census\ncounted 29 caste groups and 26 ethnic groups with over 50 language groups and subgroups. The\nmajority of the population (86 percent) lives in rural areas. The literacy rate is 38 percent. Among\nthe poor, only 20 percent are literate compared with 60 percent among the higher income groups.\nRural  residents  are  twice  more  likely  to  be  illiterate  than  those  living  in  the  urban  areas.  Gender\ninequality is also evident. The literacy rate is 52 percent for men and 24 percent for women. This\ndisparity  is  magnified  among  the  poor.  About  one  third  of  the  men  are  literate,  while  one  in  10\nwomen is. Malnutrition is prevalent: 64 percent of children are stunted.  The infant mortality rate, at\n77.2 per 1,000 live births, is high compared with that in countries at similar levels of development.\nSlow economic growth, insufficient social and economic infrastructure, a relatively high population\ngrowth  rate,  and  deep-rooted  cultural  practices  contribute  to  poverty  in  Nepal.  Poverty  excludes\npeople  from  benefiting  and  participating  in  society  and  development.  Thus,  the  major  challenges\nfacing Nepal are to break out of poverty and raise the level of human development for all groups in\nsociety, including the disadvantaged groups and females.\n\nB.  \n\nBasic Education in Nepal\n\n3.\nMore than 88 percent of the households in Nepal live within 30 minutes of a primary school.\nHowever, education levels are low and demonstrate disparities across gender, income groups, and\nregions. The primary gross enrollment ratio in 1997 was 122 while the primary net enrollment ratio\nwas only 70. More boys than girls were enrolled in primary school: two girls for every three boys\nwere in school. Education indicators are worse in the mountain and tarai regions. Less than 4 of\nevery  10  students  were  girls,  and  the  gross  enrollment  ratios  were  lower  than  in  the  rest  of  the\ncountry. Official statistics indicate that children in more than 1 of 10 households in the hill regions\ntake between half an hour to one hour to reach the nearest primary school.\n\n4.\nLow internal efficiency compounds the problems of equity and access. Grade repetition and\ndropout rates are high. In 1996, 4 in 10 students repeated grade 1, 23 percent dropped out, and\nonly  35  percent  went  on  to  grade  2.  The  proportion  of  girls  and  boys  promoted  to  grade  2  was\nabout the same at 35 and 36 percent, respectively.  In grade 5, one in five students repeated, and\n15 percent dropped out. In grade 1, girls were more likely to drop out while in grades 3 and 4, boys\nwere more likely to drop out than girls. In 1999, the survival rate to grade 5 was a low 50 percent.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\n5.\nLearning outcomes are poor. In a national study of grade 3 students, achievement levels in\nthe  three  core  subjects\u2014Nepali,  mathematics,  and  social  studies\u2014were  generally  low.  Student\nachievement levels at the primary level are unsatisfactory. In 1997, 81 percent of those who sat for\nthe primary level examination passed, representing 67.5 percent of the students enrolled in grade\n5.  The  learning  outcomes  of  girls  were  poorer  and  may  be  attributed  to  a  combination  of  the\nfollowing  factors:  unequal  access  to  quality  education,  inhospitable  learning  environments,\ninadequately trained and poorly motivated teachers, and lack of quality learning materials.\n\n6.\nImproving the quality of teaching is crucial to improving the quality of education in Nepal.  A\nlarge  proportion  of  the  teaching  staff  is  untrained.  Of  the  approximately  90,000  primary  school\nteachers,  31,500  have  no  training  of  any  kind,  and  only  156  have  undergone  the  four  training\npackages considered necessary for preservice training. The problem is compounded by lack of a\nsatisfactory system of regular preservice and in-service training.\n\nC.  \n\nThe Project\n\n7.  \nThe Project is designed to improve the quality of basic education by addressing deficiencies\nin  the  teacher  training  system  comprising  preservice,  in-service,  and  recurrent  training.  Teacher\ntraining  institutions  will  be  strengthened;  key  administrative  personnel,  trainers,  and  teachers  will\nreceive training; and curriculum and teaching learning materials will be developed. The Project also\naddresses  teaching-related  inequities  in  basic  education  across  gender  and  population  groups.\nGeneral  issues  of  enhanced  access  to  and  improved  quality  of  education  for  girls  and  other\ndisadvantaged  groups  are  being  addressed  through  the  multisource-funded  Basic  Primary\nEducation Project II (BPEP II). However, discriminatory treatment and lack of sensitivity on the part\nof teachers can discourage children from going to school.\n\nThrough  one  component\u2014educating \n\n8. \nthe\ndisadvantaged groups and girls\u2014 the Project will promote the goal of improved access for girls and\ndisadvantaged groups by:\n\nto  better  serve \n\nthe  needs  of \n\nteachers \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsupporting the training of prospective teachers who are female, giving preference to\ncandidates from 12 districts. The 12 districts were selected because the majority of\ntheir total population (65 percent) belongs to disadvantaged groups. These districts\nalso account for 20 percent of the total disadvantaged population in the country;\n\nrecruiting and training an additional 2,500 teachers who are female, preferably those\nbelonging  to  disadvantaged  groups,  for  vacancies  caused  by  natural  attrition.\nEligible female candidates will be given scholarships, with priority to candidates from\ndisadvantaged groups; and\n\ngiving sensitization training for teachers and administrators, focusing on the extent\nand nature of discrimination, ways of minimizing discrimination, and enhancing self-\nesteem  among  target  groups.  This  sensitization  element  is  integrated  within  the\ntraining curriculum to ensure that it is an integral part of the training of trainers, and\nof teachers and administrators.\n\n9.\nThis  component  is  intended  to  increase  the  representation  of  females  and  disadvantaged\ngroups  in  the  teaching  force,  and  thereby  encourage  their  enrollment.  Progress  in  meeting  this\nobjective  hinges  on  several  factors  external  to  the  Project:  (i) the  community\u2019s  attitude  toward\neducating girls; (ii) the availability of qualified candidates who will apply for the fellowships; (iii) the\n\n\fnumber  of  new  female  teachers  recruited  for  vacancies  due  to  attrition  of  currently  employed\nteachers; and (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to increasing the proportion of females.\n\n64\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nD.  \n\nSocial Assessment of the Target Groups\n\n1.  \n\nThe Client\n\nDuring  the  Project\u2019s  preparation  phase,  a  social  assessment  survey1  was  commissioned.\n10.\nIn this assessment of disadvantaged groups (DG), the term disadvantaged was defined as ''those\noppressed,  deprived,  and  downtrodden  people  making  their  living  on  traditional  occupation;\ndeprived  and  oppressed  because  of  social-economic  reasons,  and  listed  in  Nepal's  gazette  as\nsuch.\"2  For the survey, DGs were identified using the following criteria: economic deprivation and\nsocial  discrimination,  educational  backwardness,  inequitable  access  to  economic  resources,\nincentives,  and  facilities;  remoteness;  and  non-Nepali  mother  tongue.  The  sample  has  16\ndisadvantaged groups in 10 VDCs and two municipalities in five districts. The survey made use of\ntwo main field methods: school observation and group discussion. Parents of enrolled and out-of-\nschool  children,  enrolled  students  and  out-of-school  children  of  school  age,  non-participating\nfemales,  and  village  change  agents  participated  in  the  group  discussions.  Officials  at  the  district\nand VDC level were interviewed. PRA tools, such as ranking of needs, were also employed.\n\nThe  DGs  in  the  sample  include  untouchables,  indigenous  ethnic  groups,  and  minority\n11.\nreligious groups. The term ethnic minority (janajati in Nepali) is used to describe the 60 indigenous\nethnic  and  religious  groups  categorized  by  the  Government,  and  have  the  following  features:  a\ndistinct collective identity, language, religion, tradition, culture and egalitarian social structure, and\nwritten  or  oral  history.  The  amorphous  definitions  of  DGs  and  ethnic  minorities  reflect  the  deep-\nrooted sociocultural nature of discrimination. A list of disadvantaged groups prepared by the Center\nfor  Educational  Research,  Innovation  and  Development  (CERID)  is  in  Table  A10.1.  In  the  12\ndistricts  that  will  receive  preference  in  the  Project\u2019s  component  4,  two  thirds  of  the  aggregate\npopulation  and  7  of  every  10  children  aged  6\u201310  years  belong  to  ethnic  minority  and\ndisadvantaged groups (EMDG, Table A10.2). A high percentage of these children are not availing\nthemselves of educational opportunities: 4 out of 10 are not enrolled. The representation of ethnic\nminorities at the policy formulation and decision-making level is extremely limited. For example, the\ncurrent parliament has no members from the \"Dalit\" group.\n\n12.\nIn  Nepal,  remote  areas  account  for  42  percent  of  the  country's  total  land  surface  and  13\npercent  of  the  total  population.  A  remote  area  is  defined  as  a  region  with  difficult  terrain,  difficult\naccessibility, and poor communication facilities. The Government has identified 22 of 75 districts as\n\"remote  area  districts,\"  of  which  13  are  acutely  remote.  Only  eight  of  these  remote  districts  are\naccessible  by  road.  The  social  service  infrastructure  is  generally  poor,  and  service  providers  are\nnot  normally  available.  In  the  remote  regions,  primary  education  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  A\nstudy conducted by METCON in 1995 found a quarter of primary schools operated with incomplete\ngrades. Fifty-four percent of the pupils did not have a complete set of textbooks. The teacher-to-\nschool ratio was 3:1. Only 50 percent of teachers could speak and understand the local languages.\nNearly 26 percent of the teachers were found to be absent daily from the schools.\n\nThe  16  selected  groups  suffer  varying  intensities  of  disadvantage  for  varying  reasons.  A\n\n13.\nlisting of these selected groups, with their disadvantage is in Table A10.3.\n\n                                                          \n1 Enrichment of Basic Education for Ethnic Minorities and Girls.

Due\n14.\nto economic hardship, many families keep their children out of school. Landlessness leads families\nto live in temporary settlements, making it difficult for children to pursue or complete their studies.\nLow social status causes extremely low self-esteem and social alienation. \u201cUntouchability,\u201d in the\ncase of the Kami, Damai, and Sarki groups in all districts have alienated them from the rest of the\ncommunity. In the case of the Badi community of Nepalgunj Banke, the social stigma attached to\nprostitution hampers school participation.\n\nRegional  features,  such  as  climatic  conditions,  require  families  and  children  to  move  to\n15.\ndifferent locations regularly to cope with seasonal changes and search for new sources of income.\nThis  is  the  situation  in  which  the  Sherpa  of  Tatopani,  Sindhupalchok  district  and  the  Sarki  of\nDadaphaya  in  the  sample  live.  Geographic  remoteness  of  facilities  also  increases  the  cost  of\neducation and leads to lower enrollment of children, especially females.\n\nTable A10.1: List of Disadvantaged Groups In Nepal\n\nDisadvantaged Groups\nKami\nDamai\nSarki\nChamar\nBadi\nDhobi\nKasai\nChyame\nHajam\nKusule\nPode\nBantar\nDom\nDusadh\nMusahar\nBadhi\nBaraj\nKoiri\nKewat\nMaliah\nThakur\n\nDisadvantaged Indigenous Ethnic Groups\nKumal\nKisan\nKusbadia\nGangai\nGurung\nChimtan\nChepang\nChhantyal\nChhairotan\nJirel\nJhangad\nBhintan\nDolpo\nTanghe\nTaipuria\nTamang\nTokegola\nThakali\nThami\nTharu\nThudum\nDanuwar\nDarat\nDura\nDhanul\nDhimal\nNewar\nPahari\nPhri\n\nBankaria\nBaramo\nBarhagaunle\nBote\nByansi\nBhuje/Gharti\nBhote\nMagar\nManange\nMajhiMarphali\nMugali\nMeche\nRai\nRaute\nRajbanshi (Koch)\nRaji\nLarke\nLimbu\nLepcha\nLhopa\nLhomi\nSherpa\nSattar/Santhal\nSiyar/Sunuwar\nSurel\nSyangtan\nHayu\nHolung\nHyolmo\n\n2.  \n\nClient Needs\n\n16.\nFrom  a  menu  of  likely  needs,  seven  of  the  EMDGs\u2014Musahar,  Muslim,  Tamang,  Darai,\nMagar, Gurung, and Sarki\u2014were asked to rank their major needs in the context of their culture and\nschool.  The  respondents  included  both  participating  and  nonparticipating  parents  and  change\nagents in the community. They ranked their needs as followed:\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nSpecial quota, stipend\n(i) \nAlternate income source\n(ii) \nAdequate attention by the teacher\n(iii) \nSame ethnic/caste teacher\n(iv) \nSchool for disadvantaged groups\n(v) \n(vi) \nBetter student ratio than at present\n(vii)  Compatible school calendar or scheduling\n(viii)  Shorter distances to schools\n(ix) \n\nFemale teacher in school\n\n17.\nThis ranking of needs points to the primacy of the economic constraints parents face when\ndeciding  to  send  their  children  to  school.  In  this  connection,  parents  mentioned  the  need  for\nincentives,  e.g.,  stipends  and  other  subsidies,  to  lower  the  cost  of  sending  children  to  school.\nDespite the free and compulsory primary education in Nepal, families still incur costs for stationery,\nuniforms,  books,  exam  fees,  etc.  For  poorer  families,  these  school-related  expenditures  are  a\ndeterrent to sending children to school. The focus of the next set of needs is the teacher.  Parents\nallude to a need for better teacher quality that is thought to be demonstrated by adequate attention\nto  children  in  schools,  regular  monitoring  of  children\u2019s  academic  progress  and  behavior,  and  the\nteacher belonging to the same ethnic group or caste as the children.\n\n3.  \n\nClient Demands\n\n18.\nFour  of  every  ten  6  to  10-year-olds  are  not  in  school  in  the  12  selected  districts  that  will\nreceive  preference  in  the  Project\u2019s  component  4.  In  the  sample  districts,  primary  school\nparticipation  is  increasing,  yet  almost  two  out  of  five  children  are  not  enrolled.  Parents,  children,\nand  other  community  members  look  at  education  as  a  means  of  getting  employment,  and  a\nbrighter  economic  future.  It  creates  awareness  among  the  learners  of  the  many  developments\nbeyond  the  geographic  boundaries  of  their  communities,  and  opens  the  door  to  more  useful\ninformation.\n\n19.\nMany  eligible  children  are  unable  to  attend  school  for  reasons  related  to  income,  the\nteacher, and the school. Sample families indicated that their incomes are inadequate to meet the\nregular cost of schooling, including stationery, clothing, and books. Children\u2019s labor at home or in\nthe labor market supplements family income, and their economic contribution cannot be forgone.\n\n20.  \nTeacher-related  factors  for  nonparticipation  have  several  dimensions.  Six  out  of  10\nteachers  are  untrained  in  the  sampled  districts.  In  conversations  with  parents,  they  noted  this\nparticular lack of trained teachers. They observed that commitment to teaching the children of the\ncommunity  is  lacking,  and  they  surmised  this  to  be  arising  from  the  \u201ctemporary\u201d  status  of  the\nteacher\u2019s position. Parents and community change agents emphasized the need to make primary\nschool  teachers  permanent  so  as  to  expect  greater  commitment  and  better  output,  and  to  give\nstability to schools. Frequent transfers of teachers by the district education officers were also noted\nas a factor hampering children\u2019s learning. Interviewees mentioned that many teachers lack cultural\nsensitivity.    Discriminatory  behavior  in  schools  negatively  affects  disadvantaged  children\u2019s  self-\nesteem  and  classroom  learning.  Parents  and  children  expressed  an  urgent  need  to  deploy  a\nteacher from the same or similar ethnic background to help children learn better.\n\n21.\nFemale  teachers  are  sometimes  heavily  concentrated  in  urban  locations.  In  Sunsari  and\nTanahun, female teachers are mostly found in urban area schools. In Sindhupalchok, there are no\nfemale  teachers  despite  the  large  number  of  female  students  enrolled.  In  Simikot,  Dadaphaya,\nThehe,  Chhitaha,  Madhuban,  Pipaldada,  and  Tatopani,  the  interviewed  members  of  the  minority\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\ngroups\u2014Bhote, Sarki and Damai-Kami, Musahar, and Oraon\u2014emphasized the need for a female\nor local teacher in schools with concentration of students from EMDGs.\n\n22.\nThe national mean teacher-student ratio is 39:1. The government standards are 35:1 in the\nmountain region, 45:1 in the hills, and 55:1 in the tarai. However, sample schools visited during the\nsurvey paint a different picture. Classrooms are overcrowded. Student-teacher ratios in the visited\nschools were observed as follows: 176:1 in Chimdi, Sunsari; 125:1 in Chhitaha, Sunsari; and 111:2\nin Sindhupalchok\u2019s Bhumiraj Primary School.\n\n23.\nThe  primary  school  system  of  Nepal  urgently  needs  attractive  and  clean  schools  with\nreasonable teacher-school and teacher-student ratios. A large percentage of primary schools in the\ndisadvantaged areas do not have enough classrooms, lack toilet facilities, have no drinking water,\nand have neither a playground nor sports-related facilities/equipment.\n\n4.  \n\nAbsorptive Capacity\n\nTable A10.3 shows that in the selected communities where EMDGs are identified to be the\n24.\nmain beneficiaries, their children comprise 70 percent of the primary school age population. Four\nout  of  10  children  are  not  enrolled,  and  are  likely  to  come  mostly  from  EMDGs.  In  the  social\nassessment  survey,  parents  cited  the  need  for  teachers,  preferably  female,  who  are  sensitive  to\nthe language and culture of the communities. Teachers with pedagogical training who can not only\nimpart  knowledge  but  also  do  so  effectively  are  needed.  The  sampled  overcrowded  classrooms\nfurther underscore the need for more trained teachers who can manage and teach many students\nat same time.\n\n25.\nThe  Project  will  sponsor  2,500  female  students,  preferably  from  disadvantaged  groups.\nFocusing  on  the  12  disadvantaged  groups,  in  1998,  8,959  girls  were  enrolled  in  grade  10.\nAssuming  that  40  percent  receive  their  school  leaving  certificates,  there  will  be  about  3,600  new\neligible  females  for  the  fellowships  annually.  If  1  in  10  receives  the  fellowship  every  year,  the\nProject  can  have  about  360  students  from  the  12  disadvantaged  communities.  Other  eligible\nfemale  candidates,  especially  from  other  disadvantaged  communities,  can  also  apply,  which\nmakes  it  likely  that  all  2,500  fellowships  will  be  awarded  to  eligible  candidates  within  the  project\nimplementation period.\n\n5. \n\nGender Issues\n\nGender bias is deeply rooted in Nepali society, including in the sample districts.  Children\u2019s\n26.\neconomic  contribution  to  families,  specifically  girls\u2019,  keeps  them  from  being  enrolled  in  school.\nFamilies favor enrolling boys, and not girls. Among the interviewed families, girls spend 2-3 hours\nmore on household activities than boys do, time that could have been spent on education-related\nactivities. In all of Nepal, only three girls are enrolled for every four enrolled boys. In some districts,\nthis ratio is even lower.\n\n27.\nTradition  binds  women  to  their  homes;  women  are  less  likely  than  men  to  be  working\noutside  their  houses.  Among  primary  education  teachers,  this  is  exemplified  by  the  minority\nrepresentation of women at 22.5 percent. In the tarai, mountain, and hill regions in 1997, less than\none  in  five  teachers  was  a  female.  To  increase  female  representation  in  primary  education,\nespecially  members  of  disadvantaged  groups,  the  Project  will  support  preservice  training\nfellowships for females, especially from the disadvantaged groups. The Government\u2019s commitment\nto increasing the proportion of female teachers will play a crucial role in achieving this objective.\n\n\fTable A10.2: Educational profile of Ethnic Minority and Disadvantaged Groups in 12 Project Districts\n\nProject\nDistricts/\nRegionsa\n\nTotal\nPopulation\n\nEthnic Minority\nOut of Total\nPopulation\n\nNumber\n\nPercent\n\nNo. of\nPrimary\nSchools\n\n6-10 yrs\nPopulation in the District\n\nDistrict\nTotal\n\nEM/Dalit\nout of\nTotal\n\nUnenrolled\nout of\nTotal\n\n285,604\n\n226,471\n\n79.3\n\n206\n\n47,523\n\n37,367\n\n23,286\n\n198,784\n\n135,472\n\n68.2\n\n29,202\n\n22,352\n\n3,796\n\n354,413\n\n126,818\n\n35.8\n\n60,020\n\n20,924\n\n18,607\n\n167,168\n\n53,018\n\n31.7\n\n25,217\n\n8,747\n\n34,383\n\n10,845\n\n31.5\n\n4,506\n\n789\n\n7,313\n\n1,522\n\n440,146\n\n386,551\n\n87.8\n\n68,137\n\n63,780\n\n35,431\n\n323\n\n337\n\n304\n\n92\n\n231\n\n199\n\n488\n\n100,552\n\n73,054\n\n72.7\n\n13,724\n\n12,053\n\n686\n\n8.

Teacher  training  improves\npedagogical  skills  and  expands  teachers\u2019  subject  knowledge.  The  extensive  teacher  training\nthat  the  Project  will  provide  will  raise  teachers\u2019  competencies  through  improved  and  effective\nteaching  methods,  and  enhance  the  quality  of  information  imparted  to  students.  Teachers\u2019\nexpanded  subject  knowledge  and  better  pedagogical  skills  will  enhance  student  learning:  this\nwill  encourage  parents  to  send  their  children  to  school,  and  students  to  stay  in  school.  Thus,\ndropouts and repetitions will decrease, and more students will be able complete their grades on\na  year-to-year  basis.  The  sensitization  component  of  the  Project  will  enhance  teachers\u2019\nsensitivity to the needs of various members of the student body, especially girls and members of\ndisadvantaged  groups,  and  will  improve  the  latter\u2019s  enrollment  and  retention  rates.  The\nfellowship  component,  which  awards  teacher  training  scholarships  to  females,  will  further\nstrengthen the potential benefits of the sensitization component. The greater number of primary\nschool  graduates  and  improved  educational  outcomes  will  enhance  not  only  the  quality  of\nentrants  to  Nepal\u2019s  labor  market  but  also  their  number,  and  thus  further  contribute  to  Nepal\u2019s\ndevelopment.\n\nThe  cost-benefit  analysis  of  the  Project  is  at  best  indicative.  The  benefits  on  which\n2.\nvalues have been determined are first-round effects. Education generates positive externalities\nand long-term social benefits to which no monetary values are assigned in this analysis. These\nsocial  benefits  include  reduced  fertility  rates  and  improved  health  outcomes.  Education  is\nassociated with reduced fertility rates, higher utilization of health services, improved nutritional\nstatus, and more equitable distribution of resources within the household.  All these benefits are\nintergenerational.\n\nDuring  project  implementation,  32,000  teachers  will  complete  basic  training,  another\n3.\n41,000 will complete the integrated packages 2 and 3, and 34,000 more will complete package\n4. Additionally, preservice training will be provided to about 15,000 teachers.\n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  calculated  from  the  market  value  of  the\n4.\nadditional pupil years completed every year due to the Project. The period of time over which\nthese benefits can be enjoyed depends on how long the trained teachers remain in the system.\nThe assumptions of the cost-benefit analysis are based on the assessment of education experts\nin  Nepal.1  Teachers  are  employed  for  22  years  on  average,  implying  an  attrition  rate  of  about\n4.5  percent.  Better  quality  teachers  are  assumed  to  produce  the  following2  by  the  end  of  the\nproject  implementation  period:    (i)  the  dropout  rate  falls  from  13  percent  to  12.6  percent,  and\n(ii) the repetition rate decreases from 24.5 percent to 23.3 percent. Over 22 years, the close to a\nmillion additional pupil-years completed will lead to greater earnings for the students.\n\n5.\nThe  economic  costs  comprise  the  project  investment,  and  the  public  and  private  unit\ncosts for each additional pupil-year completed. Public costs are the government expenditures to\neducate  each  child  per  year  in  primary  school.  Private  costs  are  incurred  by  the  families  and\ninclude the cost of books and school supplies, transportation, and food among others.\n\n                                                          \n1  The experts consulted were Dr. B. Thapa, Education Economist; Dr. G. M. Shrestha, Education Specialist; and Mr.\n\nJ. R.

In  view  of  this,  the  working  life  benefits  of  an  additional  year  of\nprimary education are conservatively assumed to accrue for a reduced period of 10 years.
