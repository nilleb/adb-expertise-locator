The proposed Project\nwill  (i)  build  the  capacity  for  policy  making,  planning,  and\nmanaging  teacher  training  programs;  (ii)  enhance  the\nprofessional  skills  of  teachers  by  training  trainers  and\nteachers,  and  developing  curriculum  and  materials;  and\n(iii) improve  access  to  basic  education  for  girls  and  other\ndisadvantaged groups by encouraging increased recruitment\nof teachers from these groups, and providing fellowships for\npre-service  training  to  women  and  candidates  from  other\ndisadvantaged groups.\nThe  Project  will  have  four  components:  (i)  building  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  National  Center  for  Education\nDevelopment, primary teacher training centers, and Distance\nEducation  Center  to  train  primary  school  teachers  by\ndeveloping staff skills and improving facilities; (ii) developing\nteacher education curriculum and teaching-learning materials;\n(iii) training  teachers,  and  educational  administrators  and\nmanagers;  and  (iv)  educating  teachers  to  better  serve  the\nneeds of girls and other disadvantaged groups.\nClassification Thematic: Human development\nEnvironmental Category C: Environmental implications were reviewed, and no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nRationale Poor quality of classroom teaching is one of the key reasons\nfor  the  overall  low  efficiency  of  basic  education,  which  is\nmanifested through low student learning achievements, and\nhigh dropout and grade repetition rates. Improving the quality\nof  classroom  teaching  is  key  to  improving  the  quality  of\neducation.  At  present,  entry-level  qualifications  for  primary\nteachers are low, and the majority of teachers have little or no\ntraining. Teacher absenteeism is high, and motivation is low.\nPoor  teaching  stems  from  lack  of  emphasis  on  training  of\nteachers,  an  unsuitable  teacher  training  curriculum  and\nteaching methods, and weak management capacity. Adequate\ninstitutional  capacity  is  required  for  the  conduct  and\nmanagement of training, curriculum development, and design\nand  development  of  teaching  and  learning  materials.\nEnhanced institutional capacity will lead to improvements in\nteaching skills and competencies of primary school teachers.\nThe  ultimate  result  is  improved  quality  of  primary  school\neducation.", "iii\nObjectives and Scope The  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  the  government  in\nimproving the quality and efficiency of basic education through\nbetter  qualified  teachers.  The  specific  objectives  are  to\nimprove  the  quality  and  coverage  of  teacher  training  by\nbuilding institutional capacity for a teacher training system that\nencompasses preservice, in-service, and recurrent training of\nprimary school teachers; and to improve access for girls and\nother disadvantaged groups.\nThe objective will be achieved by (i) building the capacity for\npolicy  making,  planning,  and  managing  teacher  training\nprograms; (ii) enhancing the professional skills of teachers by\ntraining trainers and teachers, and developing curriculum and\nmaterials;  and  (iii) encouraging  increased  recruitment  of\nfemale teachers and those from other disadvantaged groups\nby  sensitizing  teachers  and  providing  fellowships  for  pre-\nservice  training  for  women  and  candidates  from  other\ndisadvantaged groups.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project, inclusive of taxes, duties and\nother  charges,  is  estimated  at  $25.9  million  equivalent,\ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $7.2 million (28 percent)\nand  a  local  currency  cost  of  $18.7  million  equivalent  (72\npercent).\nFinancing Plan\n               ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 7.2 12.4 19.6 75.9\nGovernment 0 6.3 6.3 24.1\nTotal 7.2 18.7 25.9 100.0\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent in various currencies of Special Drawing Rights\n15,585,000.00 ($19.6 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special\nFunds resources.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan to\nthe Kingdom of Nepal for the Teacher Education Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. At the request of the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical\nassistance (TA)1 between January and October 2000 to assist the Government in preparing a\nproject  for  training  of  primary  school  teachers.  The  project  will  help  build  an  effective  and\nsustainable  system  for  teacher  education  in  the  country,  thereby  filling  a  critical  gap  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  basic  education.  In  the  past,  ADB  provided\nassistance to the Government under the Primary Education Development Project2 (PEDP) to\nestablish  the  National  Center  for  Education  Development  (NCED)  and  nine  primary  teacher\ntraining  centers  (PTTCs)  for  training  primary  school  teachers.  This  Project  will  build  on  the\ninvestments made through PEDP and strengthen the capacity of these institutions. A Fact-Finding\nMission3 was undertaken in February 2001 and an Appraisal Mission4 was fielded in May 2001.\nThroughout TA implementation and the project processing phase, there was close coordination\nand consultations with the government officials at the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES),\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  National  Planning  Commission  (NPC),  government  agencies,  aid\nagencies, and other stakeholders to forge a consensus on project objectives and modalities. The\nproject framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Economic and Social Context\n3. Nepal faces formidable challenges in the economic and social spheres. Despite a series of\ndevelopment plans and assistance from international aid agencies, Nepal\u2019s economic growth has\nbarely kept pace with its expanding population. Growth in total output, as measured by gross\ndomestic product (GDP) at factor cost, reached 6.4 percent, the highest annual growth rate in six\nyears and over the 6 percent growth rate projected under the Ninth Five-Year Plan (FY1998-\nFY2002). The higher overall growth was led by a recovery in agriculture, which grew by 5.0 percent\ncompared with 2.7 percent growth in FY1999.\n4. However, structural transformation remains slow. While the share of agriculture in GDP\ndropped from 63 percent in the 1970s to 40 percent in FY2000, much of this comes from a shift\ninto services. The value of production from services was nearly equal to that of agriculture. Trade,\nrestaurants, and hotels\u2014an industrial category strongly influenced by the level of tourism\u2014were\nthe largest service producers, making up more than 12.2 percent of GDP in FY2000. After a surge\n                                                          \n1 TA 3217-NEP: Basic Education Project, for $600,000, approved on 5 July 1999.\n2  Loan 1141-NEP(SF): Primary Education Development Project, for $19.5 million, approved on 5 December 1991.\n3 The Mission comprised S. Brar, Education Specialist/Mission Leader; L. Gutierrez, Project Economist; J. R. Giri,\nInstitutional Capacity Building Specialist; G. Shrestha, Teacher Training and Curriculum Development Specialist; and\nB. Thapa, Financial Analyst. E. Haugh Jr, Manager AWEH, provided guidance to the Mission. The Mission was\nassisted by K.R. Pandey, Project Implementation Officer, Nepal Resident Mission.\n4 The  Mission  comprised  S.  Brar,  Education  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  L.  Gutierrez,  Project  Economist;  C.\nVandenabeele, Legal Counsel; and A. Rorris, Financial Analyst. The Mission was assisted by K.R. Pandey, Project\nImplementation Officer, Nepal Resident Mission.", "2\nin the 1980s, industrial expansion tapered off in the 1990s with industry\u2019s share of GDP hovering\naround the 20 percent range, compared with 13 percent in FY1975-FY1979.\n5. Development expenditures rose by 16.1 percent in FY2000, a significant improvement over\nthe previous year but fell short of the 20 percent envisaged in the budget. Foreign grants and loans\naccounted for about 50 percent of development expenditures in FY2000. Dependence on foreign\nresources is likely to continue with foreign loans and grants again expected to cover 55 percent of\nbudgeted development expenditures in FY2001.\n6. Social indicators in Nepal are weak. The total fertility rate remains high at 4.6. The infant\nmortality rate at 75 per 1,000 live births is high compared with that in countries at similar income\nlevels. About 71 percent of the population have access to safe water and only 16 percent of\nhouseholds have sanitary facilities. Access to education also remains low. About 50 percent of the\npopulation above 6 years is still illiterate and about 30 percent of children of school age are outside\nschool. The major challenge facing Nepal is to overcome this vicious cycle of poverty and low\nhuman  development.  Consequently,  special  policy  efforts  and  stepped-up  investments  are\nnecessary to provide universal access to basic human development services, particularly basic\neducation and health.\n2.  The Education Sector\n7. Since  the  establishment  of  the  formal  school  system  in  1950,  school  education  has\nundergone continuous change in response to the evolving socioeconomic situation in the country.\nFrom  1951  to  1971,  primary  education  comprised  five  years  of  schooling.  In  1971,  with  the\nimplementation of a national education system plan, this cycle was reduced to three years. In\n1981, the five-year cycle of primary schooling was restored. Similarly, the structure of secondary\neducation changed from the previous three years (grades 8-10) to the current five years (grades 6-\n10). Grades 6-8, though currently part of secondary education, continue to be referred to as lower\nsecondary. Even now, there is some debate on the need for structural changes in the system. But\ndespite the debate, some basic issues in the sector remain constant. A synopsis of the institutional\nsetup and issues in school education, particularly basic education, is given here.\na. Structure\n8. The education system in Nepal consists of five years of primary education, three years\n(grades 6-8) of lower secondary education, and two years (grades 9-10) of secondary education.\nGrades 11-12 are currently part of tertiary education. The normal manner of creating secondary\nschools is by steadily upgrading existing primary schools. Therefore, most schools that are referred\nto as secondary schools have classes from grades 1 to 10. Some have a kindergarten as well. A\nfew secondary schools also have grades 11 and 12. A school-leaving certificate (SLC) is awarded\nby examination at the end of grade 10. The certificate entitles one to entry into the tertiary level of\neducation that provides for three possible levels of qualifications: a certificate level, diploma level,\nand a university degree. Some thought is being given to restructuring of the education sector by\nintegrating grades 6-8 into primary education and grades 11 and 12 into secondary education.\nHowever, no time frame for this restructuring has been set.\n9. The network of schools in Nepal has expanded considerably, particularly at the primary\nschool level. The number of primary schools grew from about 7,256 in 1971 to 23,885 in 1998/99\nand the number of primary school teachers from 27,805 in 1981 to about 91,878 in 1998/99. There\nare about 6,617 lower secondary schools and 3,624 secondary schools. The teachers in these\nschools number about 22,000 and 16,600, respectively. Student enrollment grew rapidly at an", "3\nannual rate of above 20 percent at all levels of school education between 1950/51 and 1970/71.\nHowever, annual growth rates declined to 3 percent, 7.4 percent, and 3.9 percent, respectively,\nbetween 1990 and 1997.\nb. Administration\n10. In the past, the policy formulation and administrative responsibility for school education lay\nwith MOES. However, with increasing external inputs into school education, particularly basic\neducation, the need to separate the policy formulation and implementation functions was felt.\nConsequently, the Department of Education (DOE) was created in 1999 with overall responsibility\nfor planning, implementing, and monitoring primary and secondary education programs. DOE is\nheaded by a director general vested with full administrative and financial responsibility. There is a\nregional  education  directorate  for  each  of  the  five  development  regions.  Under  the  regional\neducation directorates are the district education offices catering to 75 districts. They are headed by\nthe district education officers (DEOs) who are responsible for planning and supervising school\neducation at the district level. At the cutting edge, school management committees, constituted\naccording to education regulations of MOES, are responsible for the overall functioning of the\nschool.  Grades  11  and  12  are  administered  by  the  Higher  Secondary  Education  Board.  An\norganogram depicting the administrative structure of MOES and its line agencies is in Appendix 2.\nc. Teacher Training\n11. In  an  evolving  educational  administration  setup,  some  ambiguities  and  overlapping  of\nresponsibilities  remain  among  the  different  government  agencies  and  institutions.  This  is\nparticularly true in the area of teacher training. At present the following sources provide preservice\ntraining to primary school teachers: (i) private accredited training institutions that offer a 10-month\ncomprehensive training package, (ii) faculty of education (FOE) of Tribhuvan University that offers\na certificate course in education, and (iii) some higher secondary schools (HSSs) that offer courses\nin the education stream. However, the continued intake of untrained teachers has led to a low\ndemand  for  preservice  training.  As  a  result,  many  private  providers  have  discontinued  the\ncomprehensive preservice training package. The quality of education also remains a concern. In\n1999, only 21 percent of students from the education stream of HSSs passed the 12th grade\nexamination. NCED is the apex body for training of primary school teachers. Nine primary teacher\ntraining centers (PTTCs) are mandated to provide in-service training to primary school teachers.\nDue to the large numbers of untrained teachers entering the teaching force, a disproportionate\nshare of the burden for teacher training has fallen on NCED and PTTCs by way of in-service\ntraining to raise the competencies of the teachers.\n12. Teacher training is also characterized by differing views on optimum training requirements.\nUnder the multisource-funded Basic Primary Education Development Project II (BPEP II), resource\ncenters (RCs) give 10-day recurrent training. BPEP II has also partially financed the 2.5-month\nbasic training package offered by PTTCs. Only recently has consensus begun to emerge that ad\nhoc training inputs are not having the desired impact in improving classroom teaching and that a\nconcerted and well-coordinated effort is required to upgrade teacher competencies and skills. This\nincludes revisiting the content and duration of training. MOES has recommended a 10-month\ntraining currently designed to be imparted through four packages, each lasting for 2.5 months. This\ntraining is being implemented to the extent possible, given the limited capacity of the training\ninstitutions. The PTTCs are offering the basic package, DEC is providing content-based training in\nthe second and third packages through radio broadcasts, and the PTTCs are offering the fourth\npackage for a very limited number of candidates.", "4\nd. Financing\n13. Reflecting the Government\u2019s commitment to improving the quality of education, government\nbudgetary allocations for education as a percentage of the total budget have risen from an average\n10 percent between 1985 and 1990 to an average of approximately 13 percent in the 1990s. In\nFY2000, 13.2 percent of the total budgetary expenditure was allocated for education. It amounted\nto 3.2 percent of GDP. In the education sector, primary education accounted for 55 percent of the\neducation  budget,  followed  by  secondary  education  (20  percent),  and  higher  education  (19\npercent). The remaining 5 percent went to other categories such as educational administration,\ntechnical  and  vocational  education,  and  other  smaller  programs.  In  keeping  with  the  goal  of\nuniversalizing primary education and the heightened external inputs in the subsector, government\nallocations for primary education, as a percentage of the total education budget, showed a sharp\nincrease from about 49 percent in FY1995 to 55 percent in FY2000.\n14. In 1975, the Government made primary education up to grade 3 free and compulsory. With\nthe restructuring of the subsector, education has been free up to grade 5 since 1981, with the\noperating costs borne entirely by the government. Teacher salaries account for 95 percent of the\nexpenditures on primary education. Reliance on external assistance to the education sector has\ngrown sharply. In 1991, external assistance was less than 10 percent of the total education budget.\nBy 1995 it had increased to 25 percent. In FY2000, the education sector accounted for 10 percent\nof all external assistance to Nepal.\n3. Key Issues in Basic Education\na. Equity and Access\n15. Access to basic education in Nepal has improved significantly in the last two decades. The\nGovernment has been able to provide a reasonable network of schools, with more than 88 percent\nof the population having a primary school within 30 minutes walking distance from their residence.\nIn the last decade, enrollment in basic education increased from 2.88 million in 1991 to 3.46 million\nin 1997. The number of schools increased from 18,694 to 23,284 during the same period. Primary\nschool teachers increased from 74, 495 to 91,464. Literacy rates rose by 300 percent between\n1971 and 1991. Nonetheless, effective access to basic education is far from universal or equitable.\nAbout 50 percent of the children in the 6+ years age group are still illiterate and about 30 percent of\neligible children are still not enrolled in school. Most of the out-of-school children are from poor and\ndisadvantaged families living in remote areas. Girls are disproportionately represented among the\nout-of-school children.\n16. The gross enrollment ratio is 124 percent at primary level, but the net enrollment ratio is\nonly 71 percent. The gross enrollment ratio at the lower secondary level is only 53 percent\nwhereas the net enrollment ratio for lower secondary and secondary level is 31 percent and 20\npercent, respectively. There are considerable variations by sex, social and income groups, and\nregion.  Girls  constitute  only  41  percent  of  total  primary  enrollment  and  38  percent  of  lower\nsecondary enrollment. Gaps in enrollment between the poor and the non-poor are also significant.\nThe Nepal Living Standards Survey shows that children from the highest income quintile are twice\nas likely to be enrolled in primary school than those from the lowest quintile.\n17. Participation rates also differ widely across the ecological and development regions, with\npeople living in the mountainous belt and the far-western region being the most disadvantaged.\nThe net enrollment ratio ranges from 58 percent in the eastern region to 77 percent in the western", "5\nregion. Similarly, girls\u2019 enrollment is lowest in the eastern region (26 percent) and highest in the\nwestern region (43 percent).\nb. Quality\n18. Low internal efficiency and poor quality further compound the problems of equity and\naccess.  The quality of basic education remains a major cause of concern due to the internal\ninefficiency of the primary school system evident in high levels of dropout and grade repetition.\nIndicators of poor quality include high-grade repetition rates, low rates of transition to higher levels\nof education, and low student learning outcomes. The incidence of grade repetition is very high\namong first graders and fifth graders. MOES estimates from 1996 show that 40 percent of children\nenrolled in grade 1 repeat, and only 37 percent graduate to grade 2. Repetition rates average\napproximately 20 percent at each grade level. Dropout rates are high: 23 percent drop out of grade\n1 and 15 percent dropout of grade 5. Underage enrollments in grade 1 and the generally poor\nschool and classroom environment account for the high dropout rates. Girls and children from low-\nincome families are more likely to drop out. High repetition and dropout rates waste the scarce\nresources available for primary education.\n19. Student learning outcomes at both the primary and the secondary level are considered\nunsatisfactory. A national study of grade 3 and grade 5 students shows that the achievement levels\nare generally low in the three core subjects\u2014Nepali, mathematics, and social studies. Only 75\npercent of students in grade 8 receive passing marks in examinations. Again, learning outcomes\nfor girls are poorer. These low outcomes result from inequitable access to quality education,\nuncongenial learning environment, inadequately trained and poorly motivated teachers, and lack of\nquality learning materials.\nc. Teacher Training\n20. The overall competencies and qualifications of primary school teachers are considered\ninadequate. The entry-level qualification for primary school teaching is grade 10. A 10-month\npreservice  training  is  recommended,  but  is  not  a  mandatory  requirement  for  recruitment  of\nteachers. An ad hoc approach to teacher training has resulted in a teaching force with diverse\nlevels  of  training.  Of  the  approximately  90,000  primary  school  teachers  in  the  country,\napproximately 32,000 teachers have no training of any kind, and only 156 teachers have gone\nthrough the 10-month training package. The entry of large numbers into the teaching force without\nany preservice training places a heavy demand for in-service training on the limited capacity and\nscarce resources of NCED and the PTTCs. The poor performance of teachers in basic education is\na key constraint to improving the quality of education. Teacher absenteeism is high, reflecting\nweak school supervision and lack of community participation. The problem is compounded by lack\nof a satisfactory system of regular preservice and in-service training in the country. Improving the\nquality of teaching is central to Nepal\u2019s education reform efforts.  \n21. Institutional capacity for policy planning and management of basic education in general is\nlimited. This is being addressed through BPEP II. However, teacher training support for basic\neducation has been addressed in a very limited way. Even though the program implementation\nplan of BPEP II has spelled out the need for long-term training, given the very large number of\nteachers with no or little training, BPEP II focused on providing two-weeks recurrent training.5 The\nGovernment holds the view that given the low entry-level qualifications of primary school teachers,\n                                                          \n5  BPEP II sources are also providing provisional finance for the basic package of 2.5 months, pending the outcome of\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance for teacher training.", "6\na 10-month training package is essential for improving teacher competencies. There is a strong\nrationale for creating a system for long-term, regular teacher education programs. This requires\nconcerted support for strengthening institutional capacity to take on the increased responsibility for\ndesign and delivery of teacher training. In the past, ADB assisted the Government through PEDP\n(footnote  2)  for  infrastructure  support  for  NCED  and  nine  PTTCs.  These  institutions  need\nconsiderable strengthening to effectively carry out their mandate for teacher training. They need\nadequate  and  effective  linkages  with  departments  and  agencies  of  MOES  that  are  currently\ninvolved in training primary school teachers under the BPEP II program with the goal of integrating\nall these training activities under the umbrella of NCED and the PTTCs.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n22. The Government has consistently emphasized the importance of teacher training as a\nmajor strategy for improving the quality of school education. The National Education Commission\nand official documents emphasize preservice training. References to teacher training are made in\nvarious official documents, but in the absence of a single comprehensive source of policies related\nto teacher recruitment and training, implementation of these policies remains haphazard and many\nof  the  Government\u2019s  avowed  intentions  remain  unfulfilled.  For  instance,  even  though  the\nGovernment  has  stipulated  that  no  untrained  teachers  will  be  recruited,  in  effect,  untrained\nteachers continue to be recruited. This places a large burden on the limited institutional capacity for\nteacher training and additional in-service training. Besides, the lack of a clear-cut policy for teacher\ntraining and recruitment not only has swelled the ranks of untrained primary teachers; it also has\nacted as a disincentive for teachers to undergo preservice training. The reduced demand for\npreservice training, in turn, resulted in its discontinuation by private providers.\n23. The emphasis of the five-year development plans on in-service training is an inadequate\nresponse to raising teacher competencies. Emphasis on in-service training without concurrent\nemphasis on preservice training has resulted in a perennial stock of untrained teachers in primary\nschools. The lack of an incentive package and promotional avenues acts as a further disincentive\nfor teachers to undergo training. Given the low entry-level educational qualifications of teachers, a\nwell-designed preservice training package that emphasizes both content and pedagogical skills is\nnecessary to ensure improved classroom teaching.\n24. The Government is committed to making the 10-month teacher training mandatory for all\nnew and untrained permanent teachers, with some flexibility for teachers who have more than\nthree  years  teaching  experience.  However,  the  institutional  capacity  for  implementing  these\npolicies remains weak and provision of training remains an ad hoc process.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n25. External assistance to the education sector in Nepal is substantial and has been increasing\nover the years. The proportion of external assistance in total education expenditures increased\nfrom 7.2 percent in FY1992 to 25.4 percent in FY1995 as a result of considerable aid agency\nactivity in the education sector in the last decade. The relatively high illiteracy rates and the\nemphasis on universal primary education have focused aid agency interest on basic education.\n26. ADB and the World Bank are the major lenders in the education sector. ADB has provided\nfive loans totaling $56.1 million and 11 TA grants totaling $5.1 million. This assistance has focused\non primary education (mainly on a long-term teacher training program), secondary education, and\ntechnical and vocational training. The World Bank has financed six projects in primary education,\nhigher education, and technical and vocational training. The major bilateral agencies providing", "7\ngrants for the education sector are the Danish International Development Assistance (Danida),\nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  European  Union,\nFinland, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Norwegian Agency for Development,\nSwiss  Development  Corporation,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  World  Food\nProgram. Major interventions in the school sector in the last decade are as follows:\n1. Basic Education\n \n(i) A multisource-assisted6 Basic and Primary Education Project was implemented in\n1992\u20131999 with the objective of increasing access to basic and primary education,\nimproving the quality of basic education, and enhancing management efficiency. A\nsecond phase, BPEP II, is being implemented. A consortium of sources7 is providing\nassistance  of  $102.5  million  through  a  funding  mechanism  called  the  \u201cbasket\napproach.\u201d ADB did not join this consortium because it already had two ongoing\nprojects  in  education.  There  was  also  a  technical  difficulty  with  the  approach\nbecause of the possible dilution of ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. The focus of\nBPEP II is on improving access, rates of retention, and learning achievements; and\nbuilding the capacity to plan, manage, and deliver education services. The objective\nof the program is to strengthen institutional capacity at national, district, and school\nlevels  to  deliver  more  efficient  and  better  quality  basic  and  primary  education\nservices, thereby raising learning achievement and increasing equitable access,\nespecially for girls and other socially disadvantaged groups. JICA and UNICEF are\nsupporting this program outside the basket, in the area of school construction, early\nchildhood development, and out-of-school programs.\n(ii) ADB supported the Primary Education Development Project (footnote 2) with a loan\nof  $19.5  million.  The  Government  of  Norway  provided  a  grant  of  $1.4  million\nequivalent for academic consulting services and fellowship training. The objective of\nPEDP was to assist the Government in improving the quality of and access to\nprimary education, with focus on teacher training. A major outcome of PEDP was\nthe establishment of NCED and nine PTTCs. In the context of the then prevailing\nteacher training philosophies, the project also (a) supported the development of\nteacher  training  curricula  and  teaching  materials,  (b)  supported  programs  for\nmanagement personnel in primary education and for teacher trainers, (c) assisted\nthe Faculty of Education of Tribhuvan University to prepare qualified manpower for\nprimary education in Nepal, (d) assisted the Government to analyze and develop\npolicy  options  for  the  future  delivery  of  preservice  training  for  primary  school\nteachers, and (e) constructed and rehabilitated about 1,500 primary schools in\nunderserved areas. The ADB loan closed in March 2000.\n2. Secondary Education\n(i) ADB provided support for the Secondary Education Development Project8 (SEDP)\nwith a loan of $12.6 million against a total project cost of $15.8 million. The project\ncomponents  included  (a)  curriculum  and  textbook  development;  (b) in-service\ntraining for secondary school teachers; (c) examination reform; (d) improvement of\nscience facilities in selected HSSs; (e) provision of science equipment, learning\n                                                          \n6 Danida, the Government of Japan, UNICEF, and World Bank.\n7  Danida, European Union, Department for International Development Cooperation (formerly Finnish International\nDevelopment Agency, [FINNIDA]), Norwegian Agency for Development, and World Bank.\n8 Loan 1196-NEP (SF): Secondary Education Development Project, for $12.6 million, approved on 24 November 1992.", "8\nmaterials,  and  library  books  to  1,000  secondary  schools;  and  (f) improved\nmanagement  and  planning.  DFID  provided  an  additional  $8.8  million  for  staff\ndevelopment, consulting services, research, and benefit monitoring and evaluation\n(BME). The ADB loan closed in June 2000. DFID financial support continues and is\nlikely to continue until June 2002.\n27. These  interventions  have  contributed  to  significant  additions  to  and  improvements  in\ninfrastructure and improved capacity for planning, management, and delivery of education. The\ninterventions have also contributed to quantitative gains in enrollment over the years. However, a\ncontinuing  concern  is  that  student  learning  outcomes  have  not  shown  improvements\ncommensurate with the inputs. The quality of teaching is cited repeatedly as one of the lingering\ncauses of poor quality of education. Under PEDP, ADB created the infrastructure for teacher\ntraining that now needs to be strengthened.\n28. In addition to the proposed project for teacher training, in the current year an ADB TA will\nenable the Government to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the secondary education sector\nso as to identify issues, prepare strategies for addressing these issues, and prepare detailed\nfinancial plans for the sector. This is in keeping with the shift toward broader, more holistic\nsubsector-wide interventions in the education sector in Nepal. The benefits from this approach\ninclude integrated planning, coordinated interventions for optimum impact, and efficient resource\nallocation and management.\n3. Aid Coordination\n29. The Government is currently implementing BPEP II which is jointly funded by a consortium\nof aid agencies using the basket approach. BPEP II envisions comprehensive inputs into basic\neducation. Any additional inputs that have an impact on basic education need to be carefully and\nclosely coordinated with BPEP II. Throughout the implementation of ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA,\nclose coordination was maintained with the BPEP sources and the design of the proposed Project\ntook  into  account  the  linkages  that  are  necessary  for  coordination  of  activities  to  ensure\ncomplementarity  of  objectives.  DOE  is  responsible,  through  the  DEOs,  for  preparing  annual\neducation plans, selecting teachers for training, supervising teachers, as well as for administrative\nmatters affecting both teachers and schools. The DEOS also maintain liaison with the RCs that are\ncurrently responsible for the two-week recurrent teacher training provided under BPEP II. The\nProject, therefore, envisions NCED to maintain close links with DOE and the PTTCs to maintain\nclose links with DEOs and, through DEOs, with RCs, in selecting teachers, and for follow-up and\nsupervision. This will be done through the establishment of coordination committees. DOE, DEO,\nand RC personnel will receive training at NCED and PTTCs. To the extent possible, ADB will\nsynchronize the timing of the teacher education policy reviews with the BPEP II review missions.\nADB will, however, participate in the joint aid review missions of BPEP II, particularly the planning\nexercise related to teacher training and management.\nD. Lessons Learned\n30. External assistance to education has provided valuable lessons for future interventions\nincluding this Project. ADB\u2019s experience in implementing projects in the sector indicates that\ndespite the positive overall project impact, some areas need to be strengthened during project\ndesign and implementation. A review of the postevaluation reports indicates that\n(i)  project  components  aimed  at  improving  and  strengthening  crucial  educational\ncomponents, such as curriculum development and staff training, appear to have", "9\nbeen underemphasized as far as financial provisions were concerned, and the\ndesign of the fellowship input was generally not optimal because this component is\nnormally designed during implementation and not when the projects are prepared;\n(ii)  ADB  supervision  was  considered  inadequate  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and\ncomposition of review missions dispatched, the assistance provided in procurement-\nrelated  aspects,  planning  and  implementation  of  fellowship  programs,  and  the\ndevelopment of a satisfactory mechanism for BME;\n(iii)  ADB\u2019s approach to institutional capacity building requires a critical review to address\nthe issues related to appropriateness of an organizational structure, staffing pattern,\nand career development and incentive arrangements;\n31. Some broad lessons learned from interventions in the education sector in Nepal follow:\n(i)  Although BPEP I laid the foundation for efficient delivery to improve the quality of\neducation, it had no substantial achievements in the learning and achievements of\nstudents. Teacher performance was identified as one of the key areas for quality\nimprovement.\n(ii)  Interventions  to  increase  girls\u2019  enrollment  and  retention  by  appointing  female\nteachers,  strengthening  in-service  teacher  training,  and  integrating  project\nmanagement into MOES will not be sustained unless there are clear-cut policies to\nreinforce them.\n(iii)  Given the change in the training requirements from 150 hours to 10 months, PEDP\nshould have been revised to provide adequate academic consulting services during\nthe training period. As a newly created institution, NCED had no consulting services\nsupport during delivery of training. As a result, the poor professional resource base\nproduced poor-quality training. Sustained ongoing inputs are needed in building\nprofessional, administrative, and managerial capacity in institutions responsible for\nteacher training. Adequacy, deployment, and quality of consulting services need to\nbe ensured.\n(iv)  Consistent follow-up, monitoring, and on-site professional support to teachers are\nrequired  to  effect  changes  in  classroom  teaching  practices  and  behavior.  Poor\nclassroom teaching practices remain a major deterrent to improving the quality of\nschool education.\n(v)  One-time, short-term training of teachers is inadequate to bring about changes in\nclassroom teaching behavior.\n(vi)  Lack  of  a  comprehensive,  coordinated,  and  well-articulated  policy  for  teacher\ntraining has resulted in the entry of a large number of untrained teachers in the\nprimary school system.\n(vii)  Institutional coordination needs considerable improvement to strengthen teacher\ntraining.\n32. The project preparation stage has taken into account the lessons from past experiences. It\naddresses  the  critical  need  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching  by  designing  an  efficient  and", "10\nsustainable teacher education system. The Project emphasizes institutional capacity building and\nprovides for extensive professional development of NCED and PTTC staff. Institutional capacity will\nbe strengthened by integrating project activities with the day-to-day functioning of the implementing\ninstitutions. The functions of the interministerial steering committee have been merged with the\nprogram  execution  board  of  BPEP  II  to  allow  integrated  planning.  Institutional  linkages  and\ncoordination mechanisms have been created for supervision and follow-up support to teachers. A\ncoordinated  and  well-articulated  policy  for  teacher  training  will  be  developed.  A  list  of  major\nexternal assistance, lessons learned, and how these lessons have been incorporated in the Project\nare in Appendix 3.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n33. ADB\u2019s revised education policy calls for ADB to be a stronger advocate of basic education\nby undertaking public expenditure reviews in the context of country programming to ensure that\ndeveloping  member  countries  with  low  public  expenditures  on  education  allocate  a  more\nappropriate share of budgetary resources to basic education, particularly for girls and the poor.\nADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework calls for greater support to the international development\ngoals of (i) 100 percent enrollment in primary schools by 2015, and (ii) elimination of gender\ndisparities in primary and secondary education by 2005. These are congruent with the global goals\nof education for all. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy also calls for support in providing basic\nservices, including education, as a key poverty reduction measure.  ADB\u2019s sector strategy for\neducation  is,  therefore,  a  part  of  its  overall  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  of  which  social\ndevelopment, including human capital development, is a key component.\n34. ADB assistance to the education sector in Nepal is consistent with the Government\u2019s\npriorities on improving access to and the quality of primary, secondary, and nonformal education,\nand will improve human capital development as part of its poverty reduction strategy. While access\nto primary education has improved considerably, the efficiency of grades 1-5 is low with high\nrepetition and dropout rates. There are considerable disparities in access due to gender and\ngeographic location. The quality of education needs to be improved through teacher training,\ncurriculum development, and better school management, maintenance, and supervision.\n35. In  the  past  ADB  gave  assistance  for  primary  education,  secondary  education,  and\nvocational education in Nepal. In the primary education subsector, ADB has concentrated on\nimprovements in teacher training. Over time, ADB\u2019s strategy9 for the education sector in Nepal has\nevolved to emphasize strengthening the investments made during past projects and build on them\nwithin a more holistic, subsector approach. The proposed Project for teacher education has been\nconceived to strengthen the capacity of the teacher training institutions for which ADB had helped\ncreate the infrastructure under PEDP. These institutions will fill a critical gap in the area of teacher\ntraining that will complement the broader support for basic education under BPEP II. In secondary\neducation, ADB in coordination with Danida is implementing a TA to devise a comprehensive\nstrategy for investment in the subsector.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n36. The need for a coherent teacher training policy was recognized and pursued by PEDP. As\nan initial response, the Government adopted two policies: (i) all primary teachers are to hold at\nleast an SLC pass, and (ii) all primary teachers are required to complete a short-term program of\n                                                          \n9 T.A. No. 2421-NEP: Education and Health Sectors Assistance Strategy Study, for $345,000, approved on 13 October\n1995.", "11\nin-service training unless they have already been trained. For the longer term, it was emphasized\nthat a carefully conceived strategy was needed to provide (i) basic in-service training to the existing\nbatch of teachers, and (ii) adequate preservice training to new teachers. It was also emphasized\nthat, for the long term, the Government would adopt a policy that will avoid a backlog of untrained\nteachers indefinitely. Most of these concerns remain valid to date and it is urgent that policy\nmeasures for teacher training be strengthened.\n37. The Government recognizes the role and importance of teacher education in improving the\nquality  of  education  and  is  strongly  committed  to  the  proposed  Project.  It  has  specifically\nemphasized (i) strengthening the NCED and PTTCs created through PEDP; (ii) developing NCED\nas the apex body for training teachers and educational administrators; (iii) developing the training\nstrategies to support the achievement of BPEP II objectives; (iv)  supporting private providers of\ntraining by providing educational materials, curriculum development, and training the trainers; and\n(v) clearing the backlog of untrained teachers already in service as early as possible.\n38. A review of progress under BPEP II indicates that a major constraint to improving the\nquality  of  basic  education  is  the  quality  of  teaching  itself.  The  current  in-service  training  for\nteachers is not enough to translate into improved teaching practices in the classroom. The low-\nlevel  entry  qualifications  for  primary  school  teachers  coupled  with  the  overall  poor  quality  of\neducation  necessitate  a  structured,  well-designed  program  for  both  preservice  and  in-service\nteacher training. However, the large number of untrained teachers already in the system presents\na challenge that needs to be accorded high priority. Consequently, in preparing the Project, policy\ndialogue with the Government has centered on the contribution of the Project to (i) improving the\nquality and efficiency of basic education by improving the skills and training of primary school\nteachers; (ii) institutional capacity building to take on the responsibility for current and future\nteacher training needs; and (iii) improving access for disadvantaged groups, particularly girls,\nthrough greater representation of women, especially from disadvantaged groups, in the teaching\nforce.    In  view  of  the  ongoing  multisource  inputs  in  the  school  sector,  aid  coordination  and\nGovernment policies affecting aid inputs were also discussed.\n1.  Coordination of Aid Inputs\n39. Given the formidable challenge that Nepal faces in achieving the goals of gender parity and\nincreasing enrollments in primary education, the aid community provides substantial assistance to\nthe  education  sector.  Coordinating  external  assistance  and  dovetailing  it  effectively  into  the\neducation system pose a challenge. Extensive discussions were held with Government and aid\nrepresentatives to ensure that the proposed Project will complement the inputs of BPEP II. Careful\nthought  was  given  to  dovetailing  the  teacher  training  activities  of  BPEP  II  into  the  planned\nexpanded  activities  of  NCED  and  the  PTTCs.  These  institutions  will  also  support  the  RCs\nestablished under BPEP II for giving training and assistance to teachers in schools.\n2.  Teacher Recruitment and Training Policy\n40. It is agreed that a comprehensive policy framework for teacher training is necessary. Even\nthough the Government has made preservice training mandatory for recruiting new teachers, in the\npast this policy has not been enforced. Continued recruitment of untrained teachers has rendered\nthe policy ineffective and reduced the demand for preservice training while increasing the pressure\non limited resources for training teachers already in service. Strict enforcement of the policy is a\nprerequisite to the establishment of a teacher training system. The Government has included a\nprovision for mandatory training in the amended Education Act awaiting parliament\u2019s approval.", "12\n41. Given the very large number of untrained teachers in the system and the weak emphasis\non training, teachers are not inclined to undergo training since they see no benefit from it. It was\ntherefore agreed that a system of incentives will be designed to encourage completion of the 10-\nmonth in-service training.\n42. A teacher recruitment and training policy must also address the issue of service in remote\nand disadvantaged areas. Due to the low level of education in these areas, an adequate number of\nsuitable local candidates are seldom available. Thus outsiders are appointed to schools in these\nareas, leading to one of the causes of high absenteeism. Concerted efforts will be made to recruit\nmore teachers from disadvantaged groups as well as those from remote and disadvantaged areas.\n43. Greater representation of women in the teaching profession will be supported. It is well\ndocumented that in traditional societies, parents are reluctant to send their girls to school with no\nfemale teachers. Therefore, to bridge the enrollment gap between girls and boys, the ultimate\ntarget of recruiting is to increase women teachers to at least 50 percent of the teaching force.\nGiven the current low levels of representation and the low attrition rates, this target will not be\nachieved for many years to come. The Government has expressed its commitment to the goal of\nincreasing representation of women teachers in the teaching force. This is necessary for gender\nsensitization as well as for greater visibility and demonstrational effect as role models in a society\nwhere opportunities for women remain limited.\n3. Institutional Capacity Building\n44. The institutions responsible for training primary school teachers\u2014NCED and the PTTCs\u2014\nrequire support to enhance their capacity. A key input for effective capacity building is effective\nleadership. It was, therefore, emphasized that heads of NCED, PTTCs, and DEC must be carefully\nselected and that continuity of personnel in the institutions must be ensured so that training is not\nwasted on staff who will later transfer to other positions outside the training institutions. The\nGovernment has agreed to (i) convert the temporary positions in these institutions to permanent\npositions to boost staff commitment and morale, and (ii) devise guidelines for selecting the heads\nof training institutions and provide for stable tenure.\n4. Project Sustainability\n45. The  Government  agreed  to  (i)  sustain  the  project  by  providing  adequate  recurrent\nbudgetary  support  for  operation  and  maintenance  for  effective  functioning  of  the  training\ninstitutions; (ii) provide stable tenure for NCED and PTTC personnel; and (iii) emphasize training\nby making preservice training mandatory, by not recruiting any more untrained teachers, and by\nproviding for incentives for completing the suggested 10-month training packages for teachers\nalready in service.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n46. Despite considerable achievements in expansion, the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness\nof basic education remains low. The poor quality of classroom teaching is one key reason, which is\nmanifested in low student learning achievements, and high dropout and grade repetition rates. A\nteaching force with little or no training has a major impact on the quality of classroom teaching. It is\nincreasingly recognized that improving the quality of classroom teaching is key to improving the", "13\nquality of education. At present, entry-level qualifications for primary teachers are low and most\nteachers have little or no training. Teacher absenteeism is high and motivation is low.\n47. Poor teaching quality stems from lack of emphasis on training of teachers, an unsuitable\nteacher training curriculum and teaching methods, and weak management capacity. In view of the\nlow entry-level qualifications of primary school teachers, a well-designed system of preservice and\nin-service training for them is essential. The design of such training systems necessitates adequate\ninstitutional capacity to conduct and manage training, develop curricula, and to design and develop\nteaching and learning materials. BPEP II is undertaking large-scale interventions to improve the\nquality of basic education.\n48. The Project provides critical complementary support to BPEP II by addressing the issue of\nteacher quality through comprehensive teacher training. This was not fully addressed by BPEP II\nfor reasons explained in para. 21. It is felt that further neglect of issues related to teacher training is\nlikely to have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the BPEP II inputs. The Project is designed\nto address these issues. However, it is recognized that given the limited emphasis on teacher\ntraining so far, the Project has a rationale independent of other quality improvement inputs into the\nprimary education system.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n49. The Project\u2019s overall sectoral objective is to assist the Government in improving the quality\nand efficiency of and access to basic education through provision of better-qualified teachers. The\nspecific objectives are to improve the quality and coverage of teacher training by enhancing the\ninstitutional capacity of a teacher training system that encompasses preservice, in-service, and\nrecurrent  training  of  primary  teachers  and  to  increase  the  representation  of  disadvantaged\ngroups,10 particularly females, in the teaching force. The Project\u2019s objective will be achieved by\n(i) building the capacity for policy making, planning, and managing teacher training programs;\n(ii) enhancing  the  professional  skills  of  teachers  by  training  the  trainers  and  teachers,  and\ndeveloping  the  curriculum  and  materials;  and  (iii)  improving  access  to  basic  education  for\ndisadvantaged groups, including women, by encouraging increased recruitment of teachers from\nthese groups; by sensitizing teachers to the needs of pupils, and by providing fellowships for\npreservice training for prospective teachers from disadvantaged groups, particularly women.\n50. Even though the Project will be implemented over six years, it envisions a system for\nteacher training that aims to clear the backlog of untrained teachers and provide preservice and\nrecurrent training on a continuing and sustained basis.  As a strategic input to improving the quality\nof  basic  education  for  girls  and  other  disadvantaged  groups,  the  Project  also  recommends\nstrategies for recruiting and training teachers from such groups. The objectives will be achieved\nthrough the following four components: (i) building institutional capacity for delivering training for\nprimary school teachers by developing staff skills and improving the facilities of NCED, PTTCs, and\nDEC; (ii) developing teacher education curriculum and teaching- learning materials; (iii) training\n                                                          \n10Given the sociocultural nature of disadvantage, the definition of disadvantaged groups remains amorphous.  For the\nsocial impact assessment undertaken for the Project disadvantaged groups are defined as \u201c those oppressed, deprived\nand downtrodden people making their living on traditional occupation; deprived and oppressed because of socio-\neconomic reasons and listed as such in HMG\u2019s Gazette\u201d (Manav Maryada, HMG Ministry of Local Development,\nNational Committee for the Development of the Oppressed and the Downtrodden, vol.1, no.1, p.2). However, for the\npurpose of the Teacher Education Project, \u201c disadvantaged groups\u201d means those groups, as may be agreed upon from\ntime to time between HMGN and ADB, who, because of geographical or socio-economic reasons, generally do not\nhave equal access to opportunities. A non-exhaustive list is at Appendix 10, page 4.", "14\nteachers and educational administrators and managers; and (iv) educating teachers to better serve\nthe needs of the disadvantaged groups and girls.\n51. The Project has been designed in a highly participatory manner with the active involvement\nof all the stakeholders: government officials and agencies, aid agencies active in education, non-\ngovernmental organizations, parents, teachers, and communities particularly in selected districts\nwhere  the  majority  population  belongs  to  disadvantaged  groups.  In  particular,  teachers  were\nactively involved in the teaching needs assessment which was based on the curriculum for the\nbasic 2.5-month training package. Detailed consultations were also held with the officials at NCED,\nselected PTTCs, and DEC to assess their existing capability and projected needs. The project\ncomponents are described here (details are in a supplementary appendix).\n1. Building  an  Effective  and  Sustainable  System  for  Teacher  Education\n(Component 1)\n52. This component will provide quality training to meet the needs of the country for qualified\nprimary school teachers. It will strengthen institutional capacity to implement a comprehensive\nsystem for teacher training. The Project will do this by supporting key training institutions like\nNCED, PTTCs, DEC, and other private providers to create a network of institutions that can take\non the responsibility of teacher training in the long term. The technical capacity of the staff will be\nstrengthened through training using multiple modalities. A detailed staff development plan is in\nAppendix 4. Some enhancement of facilities will also be supported to enable the institutions to\ndischarge their roles effectively. Support will also be provided to DEC for refurbishing recording\nstudios.  Private  providers  of  teacher  training,  and  higher  secondary  schools  and  faculty  of\neducation campuses providing preservice training will also receive support for training trainers, and\nimproving  instructional  materials.  Specific  inputs  for  institutional  capacity  building  include  the\nfollowing:\na. NCED and PTTCs\n53. NCED and PTTCs were established to take on the responsibility for training primary school\nteachers. Due to the limited emphasis on teacher training, however, NCED and PTTCs were given\nneither  the  responsibilities  nor  the  inputs  to  enable  them  to  develop  according  to  the  role\nenvisioned for them. NCED and the PTTCs will be strengthened through several measures:\n(i)  Administrative reorganization. An assessment of staff needs indicates that NCED\nand PTTCs are operating below capacity and, even with additional responsibilities\nfor training accruing from the Project, additional staff requirement is minimal. These\ninstitutions, however, have staff posted against temporary positions. The temporary\npositions will be converted into permanent ones. In addition, NCED will be given a\nprocurement consultant. The financial section of NCED will be strengthened by\nupgrading  the  position  of  the  financial  officer  to  that  of  financial  analyst.  The\nadministrative  structure  of  the  PTTCs  will  be  reorganized  to  strengthen  and\nstreamline their operation.\n(ii)  Staff development. Substantial inputs are needed to upgrade the skills of the staff at\nNCED, the PTTCs, and DEC. Developing staff skills is key to long-term institutional\ncapacity building. The Project will provide, both in-country and international training\nfor master trainers, curriculum and materials developers, and management staff. In-\ncountry training will need 58 person-months of international consultants and 309 of\ndomestic consultants. Included are the services of an adviser who will be based in", "15\nNCED to give technical support to the Project. In all, 41 staff members from NCED,\n73  from  PTTC,  and  16  from  DEC  will  benefit  from  international  and  in-house\ntraining.\n(iii) Infrastructure development. The complex of NCED and that of the PTTCs are new\nand were developed under the ADB-financed PEDP. The quality of civil works is\ngenerally poor and each complex requires some improvements and additions to\nmake  it  fully  functional.  With  the  increased  responsibility  to  be  vested  on  the\ninstitutions, certain additional facilities are considered essential. NCED will have a\ntraining resource center with a seating capacity of 30 people. The center will be fully\nequipped  with  training  materials,  reference  books,  nonprint  materials  including\naudiovisual equipment, and a computer lab. NCED will also be provided with a\ndesktop  publishing  facility  to  enable  it  to  produce  and  internally  disseminate\nteaching learning materials. For the training candidates, a hostel for 30 persons with\ndining facilities will be added to the existing NCED complex. The shortcomings of\neach PTTC complex will be identified and rectified. Each PTTC will also have a fully\nequipped multimedia lab with audiovisual equipment and computers.\n(iv) Teacher management information system. The teacher management information\nsystem (TMIS) at NCED will be strengthened for improved collection, management,\nand analysis of data on teacher training. The TMIS will be linked to the education\nmanagement information system (EMIS) of DOE to allow for coordinated planning,\nmanagement,  review,  and  evaluation  of  teacher  training.  PTTCs  will  be\nstrengthened to collect and process data. Concerned staff from NCED and PTTCs\nwill receive training in TMIS.\nb. Training Management and Coordination Committee\n54. To support the above inputs, the capacity to formulate and periodically review the teacher\neducation  policy  will  also  be  strengthened  by  strengthening  the  training  management  and\ncoordination committee (TMCC). The Education Regulations of 1992 mandates the TMCC to\nreview the policy for teacher training and recommend to the Government changes in policy. The\nmembership of the TMCC will be expanded for a broader representation of agencies concerned\nwith basic education. The reorganization of the TMCC will take place before project implementation\nto  enable it  to  undertake  some  preparatory  policy-related  activities.  To  facilitate  the  effective\nfunctioning of the TMCC, NCED will serve as the secretariat with the NCED executive director\nserving as member secretary. This will ensure close linkages and coordination between the TMCC\nand NCED.\nc. Assistance to Providers of Pre-Service Teacher Training\n55. After  the  backlog  of  untrained  primary  school  teachers  has  been  cleared,  NCED  and\nPTTCs will be responsible for in-service recurrent training only. Preservice training will be the\nresponsibility of private PTTCs, HSSs, and FOE campuses. The TMCC has approved 15 private\nPTTCs.    Another  15  FOE  campuses  and  35  HSSs  will  be  selected  to  give  training.  These\ninstitutions will be accredited to attain the target of trained preservice teachers and will assist in\ntraining untrained in-service teachers. The capacity of the selected institutes will be strengthened\nby  (i) providing  increased  access  to  NCED  and  PTTCs  services,  e.g.,  training  RCs,  media\nlaboratory, and TMIS; (ii) providing trainers\u2019 training to 900 staff of these selected institutions to\nenable the institutes to conduct both in-service and preservice teacher training; (iii) providing", "16\nprinted  teaching-learning  materials,  e.g.,  trainers  guides,  resource  materials,  etc.;  and\n(iv)  encouraging participation in training and curriculum-related workshops, seminars, etc.\nd. Institutional Linkages\n56. Creating effective institutional linkages is an essential component of capacity building. To\noptimize the benefits of inputs and resources, all teacher-training activities must be coordinated\nand linkages established among institutions responsible for primary education. Since DOE is\nresponsible for administering primary education, the linkages between NCED and DOE will be\nstrengthened by forming a coordination committee with representation from NCED, DOE, DEC,\nand other related agencies as NCED may consider appropriate for effective implementation and\ncoordination. The activities of the concerned agencies will be coordinated by (i) including teacher\ntraining in the district education plans; (ii) formulating district teacher training plans that will be\napproved by DOE in consultation with NCED; (iii) NCED providing professional support in the\ndesign and development of recurrent teacher training packages; (iv) having DEOs provide NCED\nwith  information  needed  for  accrediting  the  recurrent  teacher  training  programs;  (v)  having\nconcerned staff members of DOE as members of training program and materials development\nteams; (vi) having DOE deputize staff and resource persons for training as master trainers and as\nresource  persons  for  the  conduct  of  training;  (vii)  deputizing  teachers,  supervisors,  resource\npersons, DOE personnel as master trainers and trainers for PTTCs; (viii)  supervising trained\nteachers to assess and monitor posttraining classroom behavior; (ix)  giving feedback to PTTCs\nabout  the  performance  of  trained  teachers  in  the  classroom;  and    (x)  sharing  information  in\nmonitoring and evaluation.\n2. Developing  Effective  Teacher  Education  Curriculum  and  Materials\n(Component 2)\n57. This component will focus on an improved teacher training curriculum and development of\nteaching learning materials to make training more effective, participatory, activity-based, and linked\nto school practices. The existing curriculum for teacher training has a heavy content bias. While\nteachers\u2019 mastery of the subject matter needs to be strengthened, their pedagogical skills also\nneed to be strengthened. The national primary teacher-training curriculum has been revised to\nmeet the goals and objectives of basic education. It incorporates pedagogical skills to improve the\neffectiveness and relevance of classroom teaching. Under the TA to prepare for the Project, a\nteacher needs assessment was carried out. The revised curriculum is based on that assessment.\nThe comprehensive in-service training package includes (i) a training curriculum, (ii) trainers\u2019 guide,\n(iii) training of trainers (TOT) manual, (iv) resource materials for trainees, and (v) a materials\npreparation kit.\n58. The 10-month curriculum is split into four packages, each lasting for 2.5 months. The\ncurriculum for the first or the basic training package was prepared and was approved by the\nTMCC. Packages 2 and 3 of 2.5 months each will be offered by distance mode. To facilitate this\nmode,  the curriculum  of  the  two  packages  has  been  integrated.  To  improve  the  quality  and\nefficiency of the training programs, DEC staff will receive short-term international training in script\nwriting, and distance education teacher training and management. Package 4 is designed to be an\ninteractive package that gives 40 percent of the time to practice teaching in the classroom. Even\nthough the curricula for the integrated packages 2 and 3 and package 4 have been developed,\nsupporting materials such as the TOT manual, trainers guide, resource material for trainees, etc.,\nwill be developed under the Project. The trainers guides will be pretested and a national workshop\norganized to validate the training curricula. In addition, the Project will support the preparation of\nmaterials for cultural and gender sensitization for administrators as well as teachers.", "17\n59. Under  the  project  preparatory  TA,  a  10-month  preservice  curriculum  was  prepared.\nHowever, UNICEF also supported the preparation of a preservice curriculum of shorter duration\nthrough FOE, Tribhuvan University. NCED will synthesize and integrate these two curricula. It is\nexpected that with the enhanced professional capacity of the institutions engaged in teacher\ntraining, the curriculum will be an evolving one, taking note of, and incorporating newer trends and\nmethodologies based on research and feedback.\n3. Providing Teacher and Management Training (Component 3)\n60. Under this component, approximately 32,000 teachers (approximately 38 percent of primary\nschool teachers) that have so far received no training will complete the basic training package of\n2.5 months. Thus, at the end of five years, all primary school teachers will have received the basic\npackage  of  training.  In  addition,  during  the  Project  another  41,000  primary  school  teachers\n(approximately 48 percent) will complete the integrated packages 2 and 3, and 34,000 teachers\n(approximately 40 percent) will complete package 4. During this period, preservice training (of 10-\nmonth duration and following the schedule and modalities separately designed for preservice\ntraining) will also be given to approximately 15,000 teachers.\n61. In addition, 100 officials and 500 primary school principals will receive management training\nannually. NCED will conduct management and orientation programs for (i) officials of MOES and\naffiliated  agencies,  (ii)  regional  education  directors,  (iii) DEOs,  (iv)  school  supervisors,  and\n(v) primary school headmasters. The Project will assist in building in-house capacity within NCED\nto conduct management training. International and domestic consultants will assist in preparing the\nmanagement training curriculum as well as training materials.\n62. Due to differing training modules in the past, primary school teachers have received training\nof different duration, lacking consistency. The Project will address this lack and will bring uniformity\nto the level of training the teachers receive. Approximately 9,700 teachers have received 150 hours\nof training. They will receive an additional 180 hours through RCs and secondary education\ndevelopment units to bring them at par with the teachers who have received the basic package.\nThere are 3,200 teachers who, in addition to the basic package, have received only package 2\nthrough distance education. The Distance Education Center (DEC) will train these teachers in the\nold package 3. In view of their teaching experience, 4,300 teachers aged above 50 years will\nreceive shortened training of 2.5 months duration specially designed for the group. All teachers are\nexpected to complete package 1 of training in five years. Training in the integrated packages 2 and\n3 will be completed by the eighth year and package 4 will be completed by the ninth year.\n63. PTTCs, HSSs, RCs, and secondary education development units will be used to expedite\nthe training of primary school teachers. Mobile training units will be used for training in remote\nareas. Private training institutions and university campuses will also be strengthened to build the\ncapacity to meet future training needs of the primary school system.\n64. The required number of trainers will vary from year to year. For the basic package, the\ntrainers will vary from 249 in year 4 to 160 in year 5. For package 4, the need for trainers will\nincrease gradually from 27 in the first year to 635 in the sixth year. PTTCs will work with a constant\ngroup of 63 trainers. For the rest, trainers from institutions involved with training will be identified.\nThe identified trainers will receive TOT from NCED and PTTCs. TOT packages will include training\nmanuals for the trainers.  At the start of the Project, a group of 12 master trainers will be trained\nlocally.", "18\n4. Educating  Teachers  to  Better  Serve  the  Needs  of  Girls  and  Other\nDisadvantaged Groups (Component 4)\n65. The general issues of enhanced access to and improved quality of education for girls and\nother  disadvantaged  groups  are  being  addressed  through  BPEP  II.  Even  so,  discriminatory\ntreatment and lack of sensitivity on the part of teachers can discourage children from coming to\nschool. Studies have found that lack of sensitivity to the needs of children from disadvantaged\ngroups  leads  to  low  enrollment  and  high  dropout  rates  from  such  groups.  Teachers  and\nadministrators  will  be  sensitized  to  the  extent  and  nature  of  discrimination,  and  to  ways  of\nminimizing discrimination and enhancing self-esteem among girls and children from disadvantaged\ngroups. This sensitization element is incorporated in the training curriculum to ensure that it is an\nintegral part of the training of trainers and of teachers and administrators.\n66. The representation of females and of other disadvantaged groups needs to be increased.\nAt present, only 22.5 percent of primary school teachers are female. One reason cited for this low\nrepresentation is that the number of candidates available from these groups is not adequate. In the\nabsence  of  a  provision  for  affirmative  action,  the  recruitment  of  females  and  persons  from\ndisadvantaged groups cannot be mandated but can only be encouraged. To encourage female\ncandidates  and  candidates  from  other  disadvantaged  groups  to  enter  the  teaching  force,\nscholarships for preservice training spread over five years will be given to 2,500 candidates.\nPreference will be given to candidates from the 12 districts identified as disadvantaged because\nover 65 percent of the total population there belong to disadvantaged groups. These districts also\naccount  for  20  percent  of  the  total  population  of  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  country.  The\nGovernment  has  assured  that  priority  will  be  given  to  female  teachers  in  recruiting  for  the\napproximately 3,000 vacancies arising annually mainly due to attrition.\nC. Cost Estimates\n67. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $25.9 million equivalent, of which an estimated\n$7.2 million, or 28 percent, is the foreign exchange cost, including $1.1 million interest on the\nproposed loan. The local currency cost is estimated at $18.7 million equivalent, or 72 percent of\nthe total cost.

Financing Plan\n68. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $19.6 million from its Special Funds resources to\nfinance up to 76 percent of the project cost. This includes $7.2 million of the foreign currency cost\nand $12.4 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will provide $6.3 million to\nfinance the remaining local currency costs. The loan will be repayable over 32 years including a\ngrace period of 8 years, with a 1.0 percent interest rate per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter. A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2.

The Executing Agency\n69. The Project will be implemented over six years. MOES will be the Executing Agency and\nNCED will be the Implementing Agency. NCED is an agency of the MOES reporting directly to the\nMOES.  The  Project  will  not  have  an  independent  interministerial  project  steering  committee.\nInstead, the functions of the steering committee will be subsumed with those of the program\nexecution board of BPEP II. The board is chaired by the Minister of MOES, and the membership\nincludes high-level representation from NPC, MOF, and concerned departments affiliated with\nMOES. The membership of the program execution board will be expanded to include NCED and\nDEC.  This  arrangement  reflects  funding  agency  and  Government  consensus  on  closer\ncoordination  of  the  Project  with  BPEP  II  as  well  as  better  time  management  for  effective\nimplementation.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n70. The Project will be implemented by NCED by integrating the project activities within its\nregular administrative setup. The executive director of the NCED will assume responsibility for the\nProject.  It  is  hoped  that  integrating  the  project  implementation  functions  within  the  regular\nadministrative structure of NCED will lead to a greater sense of ownership as well as strengthening\nof the institutional capacity for program implementation. A part-time procurement consultant will be\nengaged to facilitate the procurement of goods and services under the Project. The position of the\naccounts officer will be upgraded to senior accounts officer to strengthen the accounts section. To\nassist NCED in developing the capacity to take on the increased responsibility, a chief technical\nadviser will be appointed for a duration of three years to assist in strengthening management\ncapabilities within NCED and to help set in motion a well-managed training schedule.\n1. Implementation Schedule\n71. The Project will be implemented over six years beginning in 2002 and will end in 2007\n(Appendix 6). The Government has assured that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will\nbe included in the FY2001/02 budget and thereafter to sustain the project.\n2.    Procurement of Goods and Services\n 72. All goods and services for the Project will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. Contracts for civil works are not estimated to cost more than $1.0 million equivalent.\nInternational competitive bidding procedures will, therefore, not be necessary. Contracts estimated\nto cost $1.0 million equivalent or less will be under local competitive bidding procedures. The\nprocurement of goods too does not require the use of international competitive bidding procedures.\nMiscellaneous minor goods that cost less than $500,000 per contract will be procured through\ninternational shopping. Minor items costing less than the equivalent of $100,000 per contract may\nbe purchased directly. The tentative procurement packages are shown in Appendix 7.\n3. Consulting Services\n73. All consultants to be financed by ADB will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nengaging domestic consultants. A team of 10 international and 15 domestic consultants, based at\nNCED, will assist in implementing, managing, and monitoring project activities. A total consulting\ninput  of  58  person-months  international,  and  309  domestic  is  planned.  The  inputs  will  help\nstrengthen capacity in NCED, PTTCs, DEC, MOES, and other concerned agencies in a wide range", "21\nof  operational  and  management  areas  such  as  training  methodology,  training  and  materials\ndevelopment, TMIS, monitoring and evaluation, organization management, financial management,\nand different aspects of distance education delivery and management. An international consulting\nfirm  that  will  be  selected  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  will  provide  the  consulting  services.\nIndicative terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 8.\n74. The chief technical adviser will collect information on and prepare a shortlist of suitable\ninstitutions for international training for staff development. A technical committee headed by the\nSecretary of MOES, and with representation from MOF, NCED, DEC, and at least three eminent\nteacher training and management experts will scrutinize the list and make final recommendations,\nwhich the Government will submit to ADB for approval. Criteria will be devised for selecting\ncandidates and a committee will be set up to approve candidates according to the criteria. The\ncriteria will specifically lay down preference guidelines for eligible women candidates. Selected\ncandidates  will  be  required  to  sign  a  bond  pledging  service  in  the  institutions  according  to\ngovernment norms.\n4. Disbursement Procedures\n75. MOES will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and requesting budgetary\nallocations for counterpart funds. To expedite project implementation, an imprest account for the\nProject will be established with the Nepal Rastra Bank. The initial amount will be no more than a\nsix-month  projected  disbursement.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and\nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Statement of expenditures\n(SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 and to\nliquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with the guidelines. MOES will\ncoordinate the timely release of funds. This is considered essential because project activities will\ntake place at different locations and simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds\nquickly through decentralized decision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial\ncontrol. The use of the imprest account and SOE procedures will be audited by auditors acceptable\nto the ADB. A separate audit opinion on the use of imprest account and SOE should be included in\nthe annual audit report.\n5. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n76. The Government, acting through MOES, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. NCED will (i) maintain separate\naccounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in\naccordance with sound accounting principles, by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to\nADB, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited\naccounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on them.\n77. MOES, with assistance from NCED, will prepare progress reports at four-month intervals to\nbe submitted to ADB no later than 30 days after the end of each four-month period. The reports will\nbe in a format acceptable to ADB, and will include (i) progress made against established targets,\nincluding aspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve\nissues; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken\nduring  the  next  three  months;  (v)  expected  progress  during  the  succeeding  period;  and\n(vi) maintenance and repair activities undertaken on facilities.  Within three months of physical\ncompletion of the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion\nreport on the execution of the Project including costs and compliance with loan covenants.", "22\n6.  Midterm Review of the Project\n78. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of the Project at the end\nof  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The  review  will  (i)  evaluate  the  project  scope,  design,\nimplementation arrangements, and institutional processes; (ii) identify and recommend changes\nneeded in any of the areas mentioned in (i); (iii) review the teacher education policy, including\nissues related to entry-level qualifications of primary school teachers; (iv) assess the effectiveness\nof the Project in reducing the backlog of teachers to be trained; (v) evaluate the effectiveness of\nproject strategies for promoting greater participation of females and other disadvantaged groups;\n(vi)  assess  the  progress  of  capacity  building  for  NCED,  PTTCs,  and  DEC;  (vii) evaluate  the\ncoordination between the Project and BPEP II; and (viii) evaluate compliance with procedures and\nenforcement of quality control mechanisms for procuring civil works and equipment.\n7. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n79. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook, a shortlist of\nverifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation has been selected (Appendix 9). BME comprises\nactivities conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources so as to determine\nwhether the input deliveries for implementing program activities have rendered expected benefits\nto the intended beneficiaries. BME also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between\nthe plan and the execution of a program in using the resources efficiently, so that timely corrections\ncould be made to update the program and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. BME\nwill utilize information from the EMIS and TMIS, annual and semiannual reviews, midterm reviews,\nand periodic evaluations and studies.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n80. A review of the environmental implications of the Project showed no adverse environmental\nimpact. The required additional buildings and civil works are limited and do not require any fresh\nacquisition or allocation of land. Vacant land within the existing complexes of NCED and the\nPTTCs will be used for any additions and improvements to the facilities. No resettlement will be\ninvolved. MOES assured that the site, design, construction, and operations for any improvement\nmade to the physical facilities under the Project would follow ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for\nSelected Infrastructure Development Projects and other relevant guidelines. Recognizing the key\nrole education can play in improving environmental awareness among primary school teachers and\nstudents, environmental issues have been integrated into the revised basic training curriculum.\nThis integration is expected to have a beneficial impact on environmental protection in the long\nterm.\n2. Social Analysis\na.  Disadvantaged Groups\n81. The Project addresses the institutional and cultural barriers precluding the participation of\ngirls and children from disadvantaged groups. The Project will (i) promote the recruitment and\ntraining over a five-year period of an additional 2,500 teachers belonging to disadvantaged groups\nfrom  12  districts  selected  because  the  majority  of  their  population  (65  percent)  belong  to\ndisadvantaged groups; (ii) emphasize the Government\u2019s commitment that preference be given to", "23\nfemale teachers in recruiting for fresh vacancies; (iii) give sensitization training for teachers and\nadministrators, focusing on the extent and nature of discrimination, ways to minimize discrimination\nand enhance self-esteem among target groups; and (iv) integrate sensitization modules into the\nregular training curriculum for administrators and teachers. The social assessment of the Project is\nin Appendix 10.\nb. Gender\n82. Nepal ranks 119th among 143 countries in United Nations Development Programme\u2019s\n(UNDP) 1998 gender development index (GDI), published in 2000. Nepal ranks low in indicators of\nhuman development that have a direct correlation with the status of women. Gender disparity\npersists in educational attainment, health status, and participation in the decision-making process.\nWomen in Nepal are particularly deprived and severely underprivileged. Gender disparity persists\nin  educational  attainment,  health  status,  and  participation  in  the  decision-making  process.\nDisadvantaged castes and communities show higher levels of gender disparities in education. The\ndisparities in literacy are significant, with literacy rates of 52 percent for men and 24 percent for\nwomen. The gender disparities are equally glaring among the poor, the literacy rates being 32\npercent for men and only 9 percent for women. While efforts are being made to improve the status\nof women, there are constitutional and legal obstacles to equal status for women. For example,\nwomen are treated unequally under the inheritance laws. Women also suffer from trafficking and\nviolence. While women have made substantial gains in education, and the female literacy rate has\nrisen from 4 percent in 1971 to 24 in 1996, the gender gap in terms of the percentage of graduates\nat various educational levels is rising. The Government has expected efforts to close the gender\ngap as well as to improve the status of women through various development programs. The\nresults,  however,  are  likely  to  remain  limited  unless  the  gender  bias  in  the  social  system  is\nreduced, if not eliminated.\n83. The goal to raise the representation of females among primary school teachers can at best\nbe modest. Out of approximately 90,000 primary school teachers, only 22.5 percent are female. It\nis estimated that each year there will be 3,000 vacancies mainly due to attrition. Even with\noptimum recruitment of females for these vacancies, gender parity in the teaching force will not be\npossible for another decade. The Project will promote the recruitment of females, particularly from\ndisadvantaged groups, by providing scholarships to 2,500 potential candidates over a five-year\nperiod to undergo preservice training. Through this intervention, the number of eligible female\ncandidates  entering  the  teaching  profession  will  be  increased.  This  also  responds  to  a  felt\ncommunity need for greater representation of females and disadvantaged groups in the teaching\nforce in primary schools.\nc. Poverty\n84. Despite four decades of planned development, Nepal ranks among the poorest countries in\nthe world. Taking a broader view of human deprivation than the simple income measure, Nepal\nranked 144th out of 174 countries in UNDP\u2019s 2000 Human Development Report. An estimated 42\npercent of the country\u2019s population remains below the poverty line. Due to lack of comparable data,\nit is difficult to assess the trends in the poverty rate over time, but it appears that there has not\nbeen any reduction in poverty in the last 20 years, despite increases in life expectancy. In fact,\nindications are that, because of the rising population, the absolute number of the poor almost\ndoubled during this period.11 Income distribution too is becoming increasingly unequal over time.\nAverage household income widely varies by geographic area and the disparity between urban and\n                                                          \n11Nepal South Center. 1998. Nepal Human Development Report. Kathmandu.", "24\nrural areas is also large. Many factors have constrained the reduction of poverty and income\ninequality: (i) inequitable land distribution, (ii) caste and gender bias, and (iii) erratic and low\neconomic  growth  along  with  high  population  growth.  These  disparities  translate  into  acute\ndisadvantage in access to public services such as education and health that precludes meaningful\nparticipation of the poor in the economic and social spheres. Despite 300 percent increase in\nliteracy during 1971-1991, the literacy rate in Nepal remains at 38 percent. Only 20 percent of the\npoor are literate, compared with 60 percent among the higher income groups.\n85. The burden of poverty has a negative impact on the lives of children of school age,\ndepriving them of the opportunity to go to school and forcing them prematurely into labor. Of 6.23\nmillion children aged 5-14 years, an estimated 42 percent (2.6 million) regularly work, and about 21\npercent either are idle or work infrequently. Only 37 percent attend school and do not work. The\nnumber of working children is higher among girls, estimated at 48 percent compared with 36\npercent for boys. While the proportion of economically active children declined between 1981 and\n1991, boys benefited more than girls did from this transition, as indicated by the increased school\nenrollment of boys. Of all working children, approximately 61 percent go to school.\n86. Poverty is a major impediment to development. Poverty reduction is, therefore, a key goal\nin the development process. The Ninth Plan proposes poverty reduction through (i) sustained and\nbroad-based  growth,  (ii)  development  of  rural  infrastructure  and  social  priority  sectors,  and\n(iii) specific programs that target the poor. The Government has further reinforced its commitment\nto poverty reduction by mandating the NPC to prepare a poverty reduction strategy paper. All these\nefforts notwithstanding, improving access to basic services such as education and health remains\ncritical to poverty reduction.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Socioeconomic Analysis\n1. Demand Analysis\n87. Enrollments in primary schools have grown significantly. Net enrollments at the primary\nlevel are expected to be close to 100 percent by the end of the 12th Plan in 2017. It is important to\nmatch the increase in enrollments with a well-qualified, trained, and dedicated teaching force.\nPresently, of the 85,000 primary school teachers in the country, only 156 teachers have completed\nthe 10-month training package and 32,000 have no training of any kind. According to the social\nassessment survey commissioned during project preparation, parents noted the lack of trained\nteachers and teachers' lack of cultural sensitivity. Large-scale quality improvement interventions\nare under way through BPEP II to improve the quality of primary education through improved\nfacilities, management, and administration of primary education. Teacher training, however, has\nreceived limited attention under BPEP II. In the past, ADB supported teacher training through\nPEDP by establishing NCED and the PTTCs. Continued support for teacher training will not only fill\na critical gap but also is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of providing continuing support to sustain prior\ninvestments. Besides, teachers are the most critical input in primary education. The importance of\nteacher quality can be gauged from the fact that teacher salaries account for approximately 95\npercent of the budget for primary education. Neglecting issues of teacher quality results in poor\nutilization of scarce resources. The Project will assist the Government in its efforts to improve the\nquality of primary education by focusing on the critical area of teacher quality.", "25\n2. Economic Benefits\n88. The major economic benefits of the Project accrue from its contribution to improvements in\nthe internal efficiency of primary education as reflected in the reduced dropout and repetition rates\nof  primary  school  students,  since  better  qualified  teachers  will  have  greater  knowledge  and\nimproved teaching skills (Appendix 11). The dropout rate will fall from 13 percent to 12.6 percent\nand the repetition rate will decrease from 24.5 percent to 23.3 percent. Improved teacher training\nwill also increase learning and raise achievement levels. This, in turn, will enhance the quality of\nentrants to the labor force and, thereby, have a positive impact on Nepal\u2019s economy. Long-term\nbenefits  from  the  Project,  which  have  not  been  quantified,  include  greater  representation  of\nfemales and other disadvantaged groups in the workforce, and improved human development\nindicators such as reduced fertility rates and improved health outcomes.\nB. Social Dimensions\n89. The Project is designed to improve the quality of primary education through the supply of\nteachers with improved knowledge and teaching skills. This will result in reduced dropout and\nrepetition  rates  that  directly  impact  the  less  advantaged  groups.  Improved  quality  of  primary\neducation  will  also  lead  to  increased  enrollments,  which  will  directly  impact  groups  hitherto\nexcluded from participation in education. The Project has also been designed to have direct social\nbenefits on the enrollment and retention of girls and other disadvantaged groups by (i) promoting\nthe recruitment of teachers from these groups; and (ii) incorporating sensitization to the needs of\nchildren from disadvantaged groups, particularly girls, into the training curriculum for teachers as\nwell as administrators.\n90. The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be the primary school teachers who will receive\ntraining and thus will have upgraded their skills. In all, 32,000 teachers will complete the basic\ntraining package, 41,000 will complete the integrated second and third packages, and 34,000 will\ncomplete the entire 10-month training package. Additional 15,000 teachers will receive preservice\ntraining and 2,500 persons, from disadvantaged groups will have undergone preservice training\nwith  incentive  fellowships  under  the  Project.  Preference  will  be  given  to  females  from\ndisadvantaged groups. The real beneficiaries, however, will be (i) the student population in primary\nschools countrywide, current and future, who will benefit from improved quality of teaching, (ii) girls\nand  students  from  disadvantaged  groups  who  will  continue  to  benefit  from  increased\nrepresentation of women and disadvantaged groups in the primary school teaching force, and\n(iii) society  at  large  through  a  better  educated  population  and  improved  indicators  of  human\ndevelopment.\nC.  Sustainability\n91. The Project will generate minor continuing additional incremental recurrent cost after the\nproject  period.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  sustain  the  Project  into  the  future  after  its\ncompletion by making the necessary budgetary provisions. The certificate training for all in-service\nteachers will not be completed over the six-year project cycle. Approximately 37,794 teachers will\nreceive training in package 4 over three years and approximately 18,700 will receive training in the\nintegrated packages 2 and 3 through the distance mode. Though an additional $4.5 million will be\nneeded for this purpose over a three-year period, actual additional recurrent cost is minor and the\nGovernment  is  committed  to  making  adequate  budgetary  provision  for  this.  Resources  for\neducation, both from internal as well as external sources, are expected to increase in the years to\ncome. Besides, basic education is currently in an expansion phase. As consolidation begins,", "26\nresource allocation within education will be rationalized. As indicated in para. 13, the Government\u2019s\nbudgetary allocations for education have risen by an average 3 percent since 1990.\nD. Impact on Poverty\n92. The  Government  has  identified  ensuring  access  to  basic  services,  including  basic\neducation, as a key intervention for poverty reduction. The proposed Project has been conceived\nto improve the quality of classroom teaching by assisting the Government in designing long-term\nstrategies  for  teacher  training,  and  strengthening  the  institutional  infrastructure  necessary  to\nsupport these strategies. Improved quality of basic education is expected to lead to increased\nenrollments and retention and reductions in the dropout rate. Project interventions will reduce the\ndropout rate from 13 percent to 12.5 percent and in the repetition rate from 24.5 to 23 percent.\nThese gains will accrue to children that are currently out of school or vulnerable to grade repetition\nor dropping out of school. The distribution of benefits from improvements in the quality of basic\neducation will be toward children of poor families that are attending school.\n93. The Project will also increase access to education for women and other disadvantaged\ngroups by (i) sensitizing the teachers and administrators to the needs of these groups of students,\nand (ii) promoting greater representation of teachers from these groups in the teaching force by\nproviding candidates with fellowships for preservice training. Improved basic education will also\nlead to improved learning outcomes, thereby producing a better educated workforce capable of\ncontributing meaningfully to the economic and social fabric of society. Hence, the Project will have\na strong and positive, direct and indirect impact on all children enrolled in primary schools but\nparticularly on the poor and socially disadvantaged groups. The poverty reduction impact of the\nProject is substantial.\nE. Risks\n94. The  training  system  for  primary  school  teachers  in  Nepal  is  characterized  by  diverse\ntraining philosophies, curricula, training institutions, as well as lack of a coherent training policy and\nweak institutional support. Pulling together these diverse threads to forge an effective, efficient,\nand sustainable system for teacher training is a challenge with certain inherent risks. Dialogue with\nthe Government and related agencies has focused on issues that could have a negative impact on\nproject outcomes. The following risks are anticipated.\n(i)  Lack of commitment to enforcing preservice training requirements. Emphasis on in-\nservice training, as opposed to preservice training, and the continued intake of\nuntrained teachers into schools make for an unsustainable situation. It is critical that\nthe Government manifest a strong commitment to enforcing mandatory preservice\ntraining.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  TMCC  will  initiate  the  formulation  of  a\ncomprehensive policy for teacher training and set a time frame for its validation by\nthe Government.\n(ii)  Lack of coordination among the teacher training institutions and DOE, DEOs, and\nRCs in selecting and placing teachers for training. The Project will mitigate this risk\nby  establishing  functional  coordination  committees  at  the  national  and  regional\nlevels.  These  committees  will  represent  the  training  institutions  and  the\nadministrative offices concerned to ensure that functional coordination mechanisms\nare in place at the start of the project.", "27\n(iii)  Lack of leadership and commitment on the part of heads of institutions. To mitigate\nthis risk, criteria for selecting heads of NCED and PTTCs will be established in\nconsultation with ADB, and the heads will be appointed for a stable tenure of at least\nthree years.\n(iv) Lack of stable tenure for personnel at the training institutes. To ensure that capacity\nbuilding  inputs  are  fully  utilized  and  a  professional  cadre  of  training  personnel\nemerges, it is necessary that institutional staff strength reflect staff requirements. At\npresent, NCED and the PTTCs have some temporary positions. These must be\nconverted to permanent ones to justify investments in upgrading staff skills, some of\nwhich are specific to institutional needs. There is a risk that investments in staff\ndevelopment could be wasted if staff morale is low due to temporary employment, or\nif staff is moved into other organizations. To mitigate this risk, the Government has\nassured that the temporary positions will be converted to permanent ones.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n95. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n(i)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, the following actions will have been\ntaken:\n(a)  The program execution board of BPEP II will be expanded to include NCED\nand DEC, and will act as the Steering Committee for the Project;\n(b) MOES will expand the staff levels within NCED by engaging a part-time\nprocurement  consultant  for  a  total  of  six  months,  and  by  upgrading  the\nposition of senior accounts assistant to accounts officer;\n(c) NCED will establish a training coordination committee at the national level\nand zonal training coordination committees at the PTTC level, to liase with\nrelevant  agencies  and  officers  regarding  teacher  selection,  training,  and\nsupervision;\n(d)  the PTTCs will, in accordance with guidelines from NCED, select the HSSs\nand university campuses that will offer training;\n(e)  MOES  will  establish  a  technical  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of\nMOES, and including representatives of MOF, NCED, DEC and at least\nthree  eminent  teacher  training  and  management  experts,  to  make\nrecommendations for selecting international training institutions, develop the\ncriteria for selecting candidates for international training, and oversee the\nselection of candidates for such training. The criteria shall include guidelines\nfor the encouraging eligible female candidates; and\n(f)  NCED shall develop a list of criteria for eligibility for scholarships to be\nprovided under the Project.", "28\n(ii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the following actions will have been taken:\n(a) the Government will convert all temporary positions in NCED and PTTCs to\nregular positions, and appoint personnel with a stable tenure of at least two\nyears;\n(b) the TMCC will develop, and MOES will approve, a final teacher education\npolicy;\n(c) MOES will design a package of incentives to encourage already recruited\nteachers to participate in the 10-months training program;\n(d) the PTTCs will establish mobile training units, which will include at least one\nfemale trainer as well as trainers from the target group; and\n(e) NCED will prepare baseline data for evaluating the Project\u2019s achievements.\n(iii)  In addition to the preceding time-bound activities, the Government has assured that\n(a)  all  teachers  to  be  recruited  for  primary  schools  will  have  successfully\ncompleted the 10-months training program;\n(b)  MOES will take all necessary measures to increase the number of female\nteachers and teachers from other disadvantaged groups. This means priority\nrecruitment of candidates from districts where vacancies are advertised; the\nstrict  implementation  of  the  provisions  in  the  Education  Regulations\naccording to which each school will have at least one female teacher; and\nmeasures to encourage the application for scholarships from those groups;\n(c)  the Government will prepare a maintenance plan for all facilities extended,\nupgraded, or renovated under the Project, and will make the necessary\nbudget available to fund their maintenance;\n(d)  all  design,  extension,  upgrading,  renovation,  and  operations  of  facilities\nunder the Project will follow the Government\u2019s environmental requirements,\nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development\nProjects, and other ADB guidelines on the environment; and\n(e)  the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review at the end\nof the third year of project implementation.\nB. Condition for Loan Effectiveness\n96. For the loan to become effective, TMCC will have reviewed and adopted the preservice and\nin-service training curriculum taking into account the recommendations of TA 3217-NEP: Basic\nEducation Project.\nC. Condition for Loan Disbursement\n97. Before loan disbursement, the Government will have approved the revised administrative\nstructure of NCED and PTTCs, and will have appointed the executive director of NCED and the\nprincipals of the PTCCs. Such appointments will be for a stable tenure of at least two years, and in\naccordance with guidelines developed by MOES.", "29\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n98.

Introduction\n1. Nepal  is  a  predominantly  agricultural  economy  with  a  small  industry  sector  and  an\nexpanding service and tourism sector. Agriculture contributes 41 percent to the gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) and employs 81 percent of the labor force. The industry sector comprises small\nfirms producing consumer goods. Industry, mining, power, and construction together employ 5\npercent of the labor force. Trade, tourism, transport, communication, finance, and social services\nprovide work to the remaining 14 percent of the labor force. Most people are self-employed, with\nfemales (92 percent) being more likely to be so than men (76 percent). The major exports are\ncarpets and garments. India is the largest trading partner, with exports comprising mainly primary\nproducts. During the Eighth Plan Period, 1992-1997, GDP grew at the rate of 4.9 percent annually.\nPer capita income, currently estimated at $220, grew 2.9 percent per year during the same period.\nThe  sectoral  distribution  of  Nepal\u2019s  GDP  shows  a  gradual  shift  from  primary  production  to\nsecondary and tertiary production, and indicates a future need for more educated people.\n2.  Nepal  ranks  among  the  world\u2019s  poorest  countries.  Forty-two  percent  of  the  Nepali\npopulation continues to live below the poverty line. The United Nations Development Programme\u2019s\nbroader measure of development, the human development index, ranks Nepal 144th out of 174\ncountries. Large disparities persist across regions and socioeconomic groups. The 1991 census\ncounted 29 caste groups and 26 ethnic groups with over 50 language groups and subgroups. The\nmajority of the population (86 percent) lives in rural areas. The literacy rate is 38 percent. Among\nthe poor, only 20 percent are literate compared with 60 percent among the higher income groups.\nRural residents are twice more likely to be illiterate than those living in the urban areas. Gender\ninequality is also evident. The literacy rate is 52 percent for men and 24 percent for women. This\ndisparity is magnified among the poor. About one third of the men are literate, while one in 10\nwomen is. Malnutrition is prevalent: 64 percent of children are stunted.  The infant mortality rate, at\n77.2 per 1,000 live births, is high compared with that in countries at similar levels of development.\nSlow economic growth, insufficient social and economic infrastructure, a relatively high population\ngrowth rate, and deep-rooted cultural practices contribute to poverty in Nepal. Poverty excludes\npeople from benefiting and participating in society and development. Thus, the major challenges\nfacing Nepal are to break out of poverty and raise the level of human development for all groups in\nsociety, including the disadvantaged groups and females.\nB.   Basic Education in Nepal\n3. More than 88 percent of the households in Nepal live within 30 minutes of a primary school.\nHowever, education levels are low and demonstrate disparities across gender, income groups, and\nregions. The primary gross enrollment ratio in 1997 was 122 while the primary net enrollment ratio\nwas only 70. More boys than girls were enrolled in primary school: two girls for every three boys\nwere in school. Education indicators are worse in the mountain and tarai regions. Less than 4 of\nevery 10 students were girls, and the gross enrollment ratios were lower than in the rest of the\ncountry. Official statistics indicate that children in more than 1 of 10 households in the hill regions\ntake between half an hour to one hour to reach the nearest primary school.\n4. Low internal efficiency compounds the problems of equity and access. Grade repetition and\ndropout rates are high. In 1996, 4 in 10 students repeated grade 1, 23 percent dropped out, and\nonly 35 percent went on to grade 2. The proportion of girls and boys promoted to grade 2 was\nabout the same at 35 and 36 percent, respectively.  In grade 5, one in five students repeated, and\n15 percent dropped out. In grade 1, girls were more likely to drop out while in grades 3 and 4, boys\nwere more likely to drop out than girls. In 1999, the survival rate to grade 5 was a low 50 percent.", "63\nAppendix 10, page 2\n5. Learning outcomes are poor. In a national study of grade 3 students, achievement levels in\nthe three core subjects\u2014Nepali, mathematics, and social studies\u2014were generally low. Student\nachievement levels at the primary level are unsatisfactory. In 1997, 81 percent of those who sat for\nthe primary level examination passed, representing 67.5 percent of the students enrolled in grade\n5. The learning outcomes of girls were poorer and may be attributed to a combination of the\nfollowing  factors:  unequal  access  to  quality  education,  inhospitable  learning  environments,\ninadequately trained and poorly motivated teachers, and lack of quality learning materials.\n6. Improving the quality of teaching is crucial to improving the quality of education in Nepal.  A\nlarge proportion of the teaching staff is untrained. Of the approximately 90,000 primary school\nteachers, 31,500 have no training of any kind, and only 156 have undergone the four training\npackages considered necessary for preservice training. The problem is compounded by lack of a\nsatisfactory system of regular preservice and in-service training.\nC.   The Project\n7.   The Project is designed to improve the quality of basic education by addressing deficiencies\nin the teacher training system comprising preservice, in-service, and recurrent training. Teacher\ntraining institutions will be strengthened; key administrative personnel, trainers, and teachers will\nreceive training; and curriculum and teaching learning materials will be developed. The Project also\naddresses teaching-related inequities in basic education across gender and population groups.\nGeneral issues of enhanced access to and improved quality of education for girls and other\ndisadvantaged  groups  are  being  addressed  through  the  multisource-funded  Basic  Primary\nEducation Project II (BPEP II). However, discriminatory treatment and lack of sensitivity on the part\nof teachers can discourage children from going to school.\n8.  Through  one  component\u2014educating  teachers  to  better  serve  the  needs  of  the\ndisadvantaged groups and girls\u2014 the Project will promote the goal of improved access for girls and\ndisadvantaged groups by:\n(i)  supporting the training of prospective teachers who are female, giving preference to\ncandidates from 12 districts. The 12 districts were selected because the majority of\ntheir total population (65 percent) belongs to disadvantaged groups. These districts\nalso account for 20 percent of the total disadvantaged population in the country;\n(ii)  recruiting and training an additional 2,500 teachers who are female, preferably those\nbelonging  to  disadvantaged  groups,  for  vacancies  caused  by  natural  attrition.\nEligible female candidates will be given scholarships, with priority to candidates from\ndisadvantaged groups; and\n(iii)  giving sensitization training for teachers and administrators, focusing on the extent\nand nature of discrimination, ways of minimizing discrimination, and enhancing self-\nesteem among target groups. This sensitization element is integrated within the\ntraining curriculum to ensure that it is an integral part of the training of trainers, and\nof teachers and administrators.\n9. This component is intended to increase the representation of females and disadvantaged\ngroups in the teaching force, and thereby encourage their enrollment. Progress in meeting this\nobjective hinges on several factors external to the Project: (i) the community\u2019s attitude toward\neducating girls; (ii) the availability of qualified candidates who will apply for the fellowships; (iii) the", "64\nAppendix 10, page 3\nnumber of new female teachers recruited for vacancies due to attrition of currently employed\nteachers; and (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to increasing the proportion of females.\nD.   Social Assessment of the Target Groups\n1.   The Client\n10. During the Project\u2019s preparation phase, a social assessment survey1 was commissioned.\nIn this assessment of disadvantaged groups (DG), the term disadvantaged was defined as ''those\noppressed,  deprived,  and  downtrodden  people  making  their  living  on  traditional  occupation;\ndeprived and oppressed because of social-economic reasons, and listed in Nepal's gazette as\nsuch.\"2  For the survey, DGs were identified using the following criteria: economic deprivation and\nsocial  discrimination,  educational  backwardness,  inequitable  access  to  economic  resources,\nincentives,  and  facilities;  remoteness;  and  non-Nepali  mother  tongue.  The  sample  has  16\ndisadvantaged groups in 10 VDCs and two municipalities in five districts. The survey made use of\ntwo main field methods: school observation and group discussion. Parents of enrolled and out-of-\nschool  children,  enrolled  students  and  out-of-school  children  of  school  age,  non-participating\nfemales, and village change agents participated in the group discussions. Officials at the district\nand VDC level were interviewed. PRA tools, such as ranking of needs, were also employed.\n11. The DGs in the sample include untouchables, indigenous ethnic groups, and minority\nreligious groups. The term ethnic minority (janajati in Nepali) is used to describe the 60 indigenous\nethnic and religious groups categorized by the Government, and have the following features: a\ndistinct collective identity, language, religion, tradition, culture and egalitarian social structure, and\nwritten or oral history. The amorphous definitions of DGs and ethnic minorities reflect the deep-\nrooted sociocultural nature of discrimination. A list of disadvantaged groups prepared by the Center\nfor Educational Research, Innovation and Development (CERID) is in Table A10.1. In the 12\ndistricts that will receive preference in the Project\u2019s component 4, two thirds of the aggregate\npopulation  and  7  of  every  10  children  aged  6\u201310  years  belong  to  ethnic  minority  and\ndisadvantaged groups (EMDG, Table A10.2). A high percentage of these children are not availing\nthemselves of educational opportunities: 4 out of 10 are not enrolled. The representation of ethnic\nminorities at the policy formulation and decision-making level is extremely limited. For example, the\ncurrent parliament has no members from the \"Dalit\" group.\n12. In Nepal, remote areas account for 42 percent of the country's total land surface and 13\npercent of the total population. A remote area is defined as a region with difficult terrain, difficult\naccessibility, and poor communication facilities. The Government has identified 22 of 75 districts as\n\"remote area districts,\" of which 13 are acutely remote. Only eight of these remote districts are\naccessible by road. The social service infrastructure is generally poor, and service providers are\nnot normally available. In the remote regions, primary education leaves much to be desired. A\nstudy conducted by METCON in 1995 found a quarter of primary schools operated with incomplete\ngrades. Fifty-four percent of the pupils did not have a complete set of textbooks. The teacher-to-\nschool ratio was 3:1. Only 50 percent of teachers could speak and understand the local languages.\nNearly 26 percent of the teachers were found to be absent daily from the schools.\n13. The 16 selected groups suffer varying intensities of disadvantage for varying reasons. A\nlisting of these selected groups, with their disadvantage is in Table A10.3.\n                                                          \n1 Enrichment of Basic Education for Ethnic Minorities and Girls.

All groups in the sample live in extreme poverty and have extremely low social status. Due\nto economic hardship, many families keep their children out of school. Landlessness leads families\nto live in temporary settlements, making it difficult for children to pursue or complete their studies.\nLow social status causes extremely low self-esteem and social alienation. \u201cUntouchability,\u201d in the\ncase of the Kami, Damai, and Sarki groups in all districts have alienated them from the rest of the\ncommunity. In the case of the Badi community of Nepalgunj Banke, the social stigma attached to\nprostitution hampers school participation.\n15. Regional features, such as climatic conditions, require families and children to move to\ndifferent locations regularly to cope with seasonal changes and search for new sources of income.\nThis is the situation in which the Sherpa of Tatopani, Sindhupalchok district and the Sarki of\nDadaphaya in the sample live. Geographic remoteness of facilities also increases the cost of\neducation and leads to lower enrollment of children, especially females.\nTable A10.1: List of Disadvantaged Groups In Nepal\nDisadvantaged Groups Disadvantaged Indigenous Ethnic Groups\nKami Kumal Bankaria\nDamai Kisan Baramo\nSarki Kusbadia Barhagaunle\nChamar Gangai Bote\nBadi Gurung Byansi\nDhobi Chimtan Bhuje/Gharti\nKasai Chepang Bhote\nChyame Chhantyal Magar\nHajam Chhairotan Manange\nKusule Jirel MajhiMarphali\nPode Jhangad Mugali\nBantar Bhintan Meche\nDom Dolpo Rai\nDusadh Tanghe Raute\nMusahar Taipuria Rajbanshi (Koch)\nBadhi Tamang Raji\nBaraj Tokegola Larke\nKoiri Thakali Limbu\nKewat Thami Lepcha\nMaliah Tharu Lhopa\nThakur Thudum Lhomi\nDanuwar Sherpa\nDarat Sattar/Santhal\nDura Siyar/Sunuwar\nDhanul Surel\nDhimal Syangtan\nNewar Hayu\nPahari Holung\nPhri Hyolmo\n2.   Client Needs\n16. From a menu of likely needs, seven of the EMDGs\u2014Musahar, Muslim, Tamang, Darai,\nMagar, Gurung, and Sarki\u2014were asked to rank their major needs in the context of their culture and\nschool. The respondents included both participating and nonparticipating parents and change\nagents in the community. They ranked their needs as followed:", "66\nAppendix 10, page 5\n(i)  Special quota, stipend\n(ii)  Alternate income source\n(iii)  Adequate attention by the teacher\n(iv)  Same ethnic/caste teacher\n(v)  School for disadvantaged groups\n(vi)  Better student ratio than at present\n(vii)  Compatible school calendar or scheduling\n(viii)  Shorter distances to schools\n(ix)  Female teacher in school\n17. This ranking of needs points to the primacy of the economic constraints parents face when\ndeciding to send their children to school. In this connection, parents mentioned the need for\nincentives, e.g., stipends and other subsidies, to lower the cost of sending children to school.\nDespite the free and compulsory primary education in Nepal, families still incur costs for stationery,\nuniforms, books, exam fees, etc. For poorer families, these school-related expenditures are a\ndeterrent to sending children to school. The focus of the next set of needs is the teacher.  Parents\nallude to a need for better teacher quality that is thought to be demonstrated by adequate attention\nto children in schools, regular monitoring of children\u2019s academic progress and behavior, and the\nteacher belonging to the same ethnic group or caste as the children.\n3.   Client Demands\n18. Four of every ten 6 to 10-year-olds are not in school in the 12 selected districts that will\nreceive  preference  in  the  Project\u2019s  component  4.  In  the  sample  districts,  primary  school\nparticipation is increasing, yet almost two out of five children are not enrolled. Parents, children,\nand other community members look at education as a means of getting employment, and a\nbrighter economic future. It creates awareness among the learners of the many developments\nbeyond the geographic boundaries of their communities, and opens the door to more useful\ninformation.\n19. Many eligible children are unable to attend school for reasons related to income, the\nteacher, and the school. Sample families indicated that their incomes are inadequate to meet the\nregular cost of schooling, including stationery, clothing, and books. Children\u2019s labor at home or in\nthe labor market supplements family income, and their economic contribution cannot be forgone.\n20.   Teacher-related  factors  for  nonparticipation  have  several  dimensions.  Six  out  of  10\nteachers are untrained in the sampled districts. In conversations with parents, they noted this\nparticular lack of trained teachers. They observed that commitment to teaching the children of the\ncommunity is lacking, and they surmised this to be arising from the \u201ctemporary\u201d status of the\nteacher\u2019s position. Parents and community change agents emphasized the need to make primary\nschool teachers permanent so as to expect greater commitment and better output, and to give\nstability to schools. Frequent transfers of teachers by the district education officers were also noted\nas a factor hampering children\u2019s learning. Interviewees mentioned that many teachers lack cultural\nsensitivity.  Discriminatory behavior in schools negatively affects disadvantaged children\u2019s self-\nesteem and classroom learning. Parents and children expressed an urgent need to deploy a\nteacher from the same or similar ethnic background to help children learn better.\n21. Female teachers are sometimes heavily concentrated in urban locations. In Sunsari and\nTanahun, female teachers are mostly found in urban area schools. In Sindhupalchok, there are no\nfemale teachers despite the large number of female students enrolled. In Simikot, Dadaphaya,\nThehe, Chhitaha, Madhuban, Pipaldada, and Tatopani, the interviewed members of the minority", "67\nAppendix 10, page 6\ngroups\u2014Bhote, Sarki and Damai-Kami, Musahar, and Oraon\u2014emphasized the need for a female\nor local teacher in schools with concentration of students from EMDGs.\n22. The national mean teacher-student ratio is 39:1. The government standards are 35:1 in the\nmountain region, 45:1 in the hills, and 55:1 in the tarai. However, sample schools visited during the\nsurvey paint a different picture. Classrooms are overcrowded. Student-teacher ratios in the visited\nschools were observed as follows: 176:1 in Chimdi, Sunsari; 125:1 in Chhitaha, Sunsari; and 111:2\nin Sindhupalchok\u2019s Bhumiraj Primary School.\n23. The primary school system of Nepal urgently needs attractive and clean schools with\nreasonable teacher-school and teacher-student ratios. A large percentage of primary schools in the\ndisadvantaged areas do not have enough classrooms, lack toilet facilities, have no drinking water,\nand have neither a playground nor sports-related facilities/equipment.\n4.   Absorptive Capacity\n24. Table A10.3 shows that in the selected communities where EMDGs are identified to be the\nmain beneficiaries, their children comprise 70 percent of the primary school age population. Four\nout of 10 children are not enrolled, and are likely to come mostly from EMDGs. In the social\nassessment survey, parents cited the need for teachers, preferably female, who are sensitive to\nthe language and culture of the communities. Teachers with pedagogical training who can not only\nimpart knowledge but also do so effectively are needed. The sampled overcrowded classrooms\nfurther underscore the need for more trained teachers who can manage and teach many students\nat same time.\n25. The Project will sponsor 2,500 female students, preferably from disadvantaged groups.\nFocusing  on  the  12  disadvantaged  groups,  in  1998,  8,959  girls  were  enrolled  in  grade  10.\nAssuming that 40 percent receive their school leaving certificates, there will be about 3,600 new\neligible females for the fellowships annually. If 1 in 10 receives the fellowship every year, the\nProject can have about 360 students from the 12 disadvantaged communities. Other eligible\nfemale  candidates,  especially  from  other  disadvantaged  communities,  can  also  apply,  which\nmakes it likely that all 2,500 fellowships will be awarded to eligible candidates within the project\nimplementation period.\n5.  Gender Issues\n26. Gender bias is deeply rooted in Nepali society, including in the sample districts.  Children\u2019s\neconomic contribution to families, specifically girls\u2019, keeps them from being enrolled in school.\nFamilies favor enrolling boys, and not girls. Among the interviewed families, girls spend 2-3 hours\nmore on household activities than boys do, time that could have been spent on education-related\nactivities. In all of Nepal, only three girls are enrolled for every four enrolled boys. In some districts,\nthis ratio is even lower.\n27. Tradition binds women to their homes; women are less likely than men to be working\noutside  their  houses.  Among  primary  education  teachers,  this  is  exemplified  by  the  minority\nrepresentation of women at 22.5 percent. In the tarai, mountain, and hill regions in 1997, less than\none  in  five  teachers  was  a  female.  To  increase  female  representation  in  primary  education,\nespecially  members  of  disadvantaged  groups,  the  Project  will  support  preservice  training\nfellowships for females, especially from the disadvantaged groups. The Government\u2019s commitment\nto increasing the proportion of female teachers will play a crucial role in achieving this objective.", "Table A10.2: Educational profile of Ethnic Minority and Disadvantaged Groups in 12 Project Districts\nEthnic Minority\nOut of Total 6-10 yrs Sup.\nProject Total Population No. of Population in the District EM/Dalit Groups Nearest Grp Total VDC /\nDistricts/ Population Number Percent Primary District EM/Dalit Unenrolled in the Districtb PTTC Zone Needed Municipality\nRegionsa Schools Total out of out of\nTotal Total\n1.

The Project is designed to improve the quality and efficiency of primary education in\nNepal by raising the quality of teachers through teacher training. Teacher training improves\npedagogical skills and expands teachers\u2019 subject knowledge. The extensive teacher training\nthat the Project will provide will raise teachers\u2019 competencies through improved and effective\nteaching methods, and enhance the quality of information imparted to students. Teachers\u2019\nexpanded subject knowledge and better pedagogical skills will enhance student learning: this\nwill encourage parents to send their children to school, and students to stay in school. Thus,\ndropouts and repetitions will decrease, and more students will be able complete their grades on\na  year-to-year  basis.  The  sensitization  component  of  the  Project  will  enhance  teachers\u2019\nsensitivity to the needs of various members of the student body, especially girls and members of\ndisadvantaged  groups,  and  will  improve  the  latter\u2019s  enrollment  and  retention  rates.  The\nfellowship  component,  which  awards  teacher  training  scholarships  to  females,  will  further\nstrengthen the potential benefits of the sensitization component. The greater number of primary\nschool graduates and improved educational outcomes will enhance not only the quality of\nentrants to Nepal\u2019s labor market but also their number, and thus further contribute to Nepal\u2019s\ndevelopment.\n2. The cost-benefit analysis of the Project is at best indicative. The benefits on which\nvalues have been determined are first-round effects. Education generates positive externalities\nand long-term social benefits to which no monetary values are assigned in this analysis. These\nsocial  benefits  include  reduced  fertility  rates  and  improved  health  outcomes.  Education  is\nassociated with reduced fertility rates, higher utilization of health services, improved nutritional\nstatus, and more equitable distribution of resources within the household.  All these benefits are\nintergenerational.\n3. During project implementation, 32,000 teachers will complete basic training, another\n41,000 will complete the integrated packages 2 and 3, and 34,000 more will complete package\n4. Additionally, preservice training will be provided to about 15,000 teachers.\n4. The  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  calculated  from  the  market  value  of  the\nadditional pupil years completed every year due to the Project. The period of time over which\nthese benefits can be enjoyed depends on how long the trained teachers remain in the system.\nThe assumptions of the cost-benefit analysis are based on the assessment of education experts\nin Nepal.1 Teachers are employed for 22 years on average, implying an attrition rate of about\n4.5 percent. Better quality teachers are assumed to produce the following2 by the end of the\nproject implementation period:  (i) the dropout rate falls from 13 percent to 12.6 percent, and\n(ii) the repetition rate decreases from 24.5 percent to 23.3 percent. Over 22 years, the close to a\nmillion additional pupil-years completed will lead to greater earnings for the students.\n5. The economic costs comprise the project investment, and the public and private unit\ncosts for each additional pupil-year completed. Public costs are the government expenditures to\neducate each child per year in primary school. Private costs are incurred by the families and\ninclude the cost of books and school supplies, transportation, and food among others.\n                                                          \n1  The experts consulted were Dr. B. Thapa, Education Economist; Dr. G. M. Shrestha, Education Specialist; and Mr.\nJ. R. Giri, Education Management Specialist.\n2  The assumptions were taken from the preparation documents of the Basic Primary Education Program II.", "71\nAppendix 11, page 2\n6. Nepal\u2019s economy is mainly agricultural; it is characterized by a high unemployment rate\nand reduced labor mobility. In view of this, the working life benefits of an additional year of\nprimary education are conservatively assumed to accrue for a reduced period of 10 years.
