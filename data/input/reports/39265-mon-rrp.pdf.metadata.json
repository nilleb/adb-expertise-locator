An  environmental \nundertaken and the summary circulated to the Board of Directors \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  made  public  through \nthe ADB website on 17 August 2007. \n \nThe  Government  of  Mongolia \nto  develop  a \n748.4-kilometer  road  corridor  through  the  western  region  of \nMongolia  connecting  Yarant  at  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC)  border  to  Ulaanbaishint  at  the  Russian  Federation  border \nvia  Hovd  and  Olgiy,  the  aimag  centers.  Making  up  a  portion  of \nAsian  Highway  4  and  a  component  of  the  larger  United  Nations \nEconomic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific-\ndesignated  Asian  Highway  Network,  the  road  corridor  will  link \nMongolia  with  both  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation, \nfacilitating  the  flow  of  goods  and  passengers  between  the  three \ncountries. Due to capacity constraints such as availability of grant \nfunds,  the  proposed  road  corridor  will  be  developed  in  two \nphases.  Under  the  Project,  a  431.2-kilometer  road  from  the  PRC \nborder  to  Hovd  aimag  (province)  center  will  be  developed  as \nphase  I.  Phase  II  will  develop  a  road  from  Hovd  aimag  center  to \nincludes  (i)  road  safety \nthe  Russian  border.  The  Project \nimprovement;  (ii)  community  development \nthe \nproject\u2019s poverty reduction impact; (iii) awareness and prevention \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  on  the  road  corridor;  (iv)  pilot \nproject  on  improvements  to  the  road  maintenance  system;  and \n(v) capacity  building  of  the  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transport  and \nTourism (MRTT) and its provincial counterparts.  \n \nThe  proposed  road  corridor  will  strengthen  Mongolia\u2019s  transport \nlinks  to  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  as  well  as  other \ncountries  in  the  region.  The  Project  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for \nMongolia,  which  focuses  on  promoting  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  social  development  by  allowing  for  more  market \nintegration  and  movement  of  people,  resulting \nin  broader \neconomic  growth  and  reducing  geographic  isolation,  thereby \nreducing poverty. The Project also supports ADB\u2019s strategy for the \nCentral  Asian  region,  which  is  designed  to  (i)  secure  access  to \nprofitable  markets  in  large  neighboring  countries  for  exports  from \nthe  Central  Asian  republics;  (ii)  reduce  transaction  costs  and \n\nto  maximize \n\n\ffor \n\nis  based  on \n\nthe  Asian  Highway  under \n\nfacilitate  transit  and  transport  across  the  region;  (iii)  improve \nenergy  supplies  for  sustaining  growth;  and  (iv)  mitigate  negative \nregional  outcomes,  such  as  environmental  degradation, \ndesertification,  human  and  drug  trafficking,  and  the  spread  of \ncommunicable diseases. \n \nThe  Project  supports  Mongolia\u2019s  priority  development  plan  of \nthe  national \nbuilding  roads \nthe  Millennium \ndevelopment  strategy,  which \nDevelopment  Goals.  As  part  of  the  Asian  Highway  Network,  the \nproject  road  will  serve  as  an  important  route  for  domestic  and \ninternational traffic. The proposed road corridor will also facilitate \nsustainable  economic  growth  in  the  two  most  western  aimags  of \nMongolia  (Hovd  and  Bayan-Olgiy),  which  had  a  poverty  rate  of \n38.7% in 2006; compared with the national average of 32.2% and \n20.4% in Ulaanbaatar. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  promotion  of  regional \ntransport  of  freight  and  passengers  via  the  Western  Regional \nRoad Corridor and increased economic development and regional \ntrade.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  an  efficient  and  safe \nregional  transport  route  developed  in  the  western  region  of \nMongolia  to  link  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  in  the  PRC \nand  Siberia  in  the  Russian  Federation  through  Hovd  and  Bayan-\nOlgiy  aimags  of  western  Mongolia.  As  part  of  Asian  Highway  4, \nthe road will help link Mongolia with the rest of Asia. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $112.22 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $10.06 million. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Mongolia \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n37.60 \n74.62 \n112.22 \n\n% \n33.5 \n66.5 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nA  grant  equivalent  to  $37.6  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.

Civil works for the project road will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Equipment will \nbe procured through national competitive bidding. \n \nThe  Project  will  finance  92.5  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services:  16  for  detailed  design,  72  for  construction \nsupervision, and 4.5 for other services. The detailed design period \nis anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2008 and last for the \nentire  year.  The  construction  supervision  consulting  services  will \nbe  required  from  the  middle  of  the  second  quarter  of  2009  and \nextend  through  the  completion  of  the  road  defects  liability  period \nat  the  end  of  the  third  quarter  of  2013.  The  Government  will \nfinance  consulting  services  for  detailed  design,  while  ADB  will \nfinance  the  construction  supervision  consulting  services.  The \nADB-financed consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-\nbased selection (80% technical and 20% financial weighting) and \nfull  technical  proposal,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  improve  the  transport  network  in  the  region, \nallowing  residents  easier,  less  expensive,  and  faster  access  to \nsocial, health, and other services; (ii) increase the annual regional \ngross domestic product of Hovd aimag to 6% after completion of \nthe  Project;  (iii)  help  increase  regional  transit  trade  tonnage \nthrough Mongolia\u2019s western region by 25% by 2014; and (iv) help \nincrease trade between the western region and the PRC and the \nRussian  Federation  by  15%  by  2013.  Income  of  targeted \nparticipants  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  increase  10%  annually. \nThe expected results of the Project include (i) reduced travel time \nfrom Yarant to Hovd aimag center by 3 hours by 2013, (ii) reduced \naverage  border  processing  times  for  goods  and  passengers  at \nYarant  by  1  hour  by  2013,  and  (iii)  traffic  volume  at  the  Yarant \nborder  increased  by  15%  annually  from  2012  to  2015.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is 16.3%. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit road users, including passengers, \ntraders,  and  transport  providers,  as  well  as  local  economies  and \nlabor.  The  environment  of  the  region  will  be  improved  through \nreduction of dust generated by vehicles traveling over earth roads \nand elimination of multiple earthen tracks that currently exist along \nthe  proposed  alignment.  A  considerable  number  of  jobs  will  be \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\ncreated  by  upgrading  the  road  and  provide  the  opportunity  for \npoor households to exit poverty status. About 2,300 total jobs will \nbe  created  for  the  road  upgrade  during  construction.  Of  these, \nnearly 1,300 jobs will be for unskilled workers. Assuming that 80% \nof  unskilled  workers  will  be  hired  from  local  poor  households, \n1,040 unskilled jobs will be available. \n \nThe Project is formulated to reduce technical, economic, financial, \nsafety,  and  social  risks.  The  main  technical  risks  are  associated \nwith  road  construction  in  the  area of  Bodonch Canyon.  The  road \nalignment  has  been  modified  to  mitigate  this  risk  and  allow  for \neasier  road  construction.  During  construction,  monitoring  and \ncontract management information systems will be set up to quickly \nidentify  and  correct  any  technical  problems.  The  contractors  will \nbe  required  to  strictly  enforce  work  safety  rules  and  measures. \nThe  extreme  climate  of  Mongolia\u2019s  western  region  also  poses \nrisks for construction and the long-term durability of materials. \n \nMaintenance  of  the  project  road  after  completion  may  be \ninadequate  due  to  insufficient  funding.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated \nmainly  through  the  introduction  of  a  road  user  fee  at  the  PRC \nborder. A similar fee will be enforced at the Russian border after \ncompletion  of  phase  II.  Based  on  the  traffic  projections,  the  fee \ncollected is adequate for annual maintenance of the project road. \nHowever,  the  financial  risk  associated  with  construction  and \noperation of the project road will depend on traffic volume and the \nsigning of a tripartite agreement between Mongolia, the PRC, and \nthe  Russian  Federation  related  to  transit  trade.  The  roughness \nfollowing \nindex  of \nconstruction.  In  addition,  routine,  periodic,  and  rehabilitation \nmaintenance works will be required to ensure the roughness index \ndoes not exceed 4.5. \n \nThe Project does not involve any resettlement and has adequate \nmitigation  and  monitoring  mechanisms  in  place  to  minimize \nenvironmental impacts.  \n\nroad  should  be  3.0 \n\nimmediately \n\nthe \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nMONGOLIA\nWESTERN REGIONAL ROAD CORRIDOR\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT,\nPHASE I\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nt\no\n \n\nN\n\no\n\nv\n\no\n\ns\n\nbir\n\ns\n\nk\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaanbaishint\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nNogoonnuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\nSelenge\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\n50  00'No\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nTakeshiken\n\nYarant\n\nHOVD\n\nUyench\n\nTayshir\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nULAANBAATAR\nLun\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBaganuur\n\nBatnorov\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nTOV\nZuunmod\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nArvayheer\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nChoyr\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nto B\n\neijin\n\ng\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\n42  00'No\n\nWestern Region\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nADB-Financed Road\n\nRoad\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nProposed Road Corridor - Phase I\n\nProposed Road Corridor - Phase II\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\nto Urumqi\n\n42  00'No\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n7\n-\n2\n2\n7\n9\na\n \nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\n\fMap 2\n\n96  00'Eo\n\n111  00'Eo\n\nRUSSIAN  FEDERATION\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaangom\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nUVS\n\nOlgiy\n\nHOVD\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nMoron\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nBULGAN\n\nErdenet\nBulgan\n\nARHANGAY\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nUliastay\n\nTsetserleg\n\nBayanhongor\n\nORHON\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nHENTIY\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nTOV\n\nChoybalsan\n\nDORNOD\n\nOndorhaan\nGOVISUMBER\n\nBaruun-Urt\nSUHBAATAR\n\nAltay\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nArvayheer\n\nChoyr\n\nMandalgovi\n\nOVORHANGAY\n\nSaynshand\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nProject Area\n\n42  00'No\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC  OF  CHINA\n\n96  00'Eo\n\n111  00'Eo\n\nR U S S I A N\nF E D E R A T I O N\n\nMONGOLIA\nWESTERN REGIONAL ROAD CORRIDOR\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT,\nPHASE I\n\no\n90  00'E\n\nUlaanbaishint\n\nUVS\n\nUlaangom\n\nMalchin\n\nNogoonnuur\n\nTsugaannuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nOlgiy\n\nTsegel\n\nOlgiy\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-OLGIY\n\n58  00'No\n\nN\n\nPEOPLE'S\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA \n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/District\n\nOther Town/Village\n\nProposed Road Corridor - Phase  I\n\nProposed Road Corridor - Phase II\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nHovd\n\nChandman\n\nManhan\n\nHOVD\n\nDzereg\n\nDariv\n\nTsetseg\n\nZAVHAN\n\n58  00'No\n\nBayan Uul\n\nYarant\n\nUyench\n\nBulgan\n\nTonhil\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nAltai\n\nTamchi\n\no\n90  00'E\n\n07-2279b HR\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  Mongolia  for  the  Western  Regional  Road  Corridor  Development  Project\u2013Phase  I  (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nMongolia has a relatively large land mass and small population, resulting in one of the \n2. \nlowest  population  densities  in  the  world;  less  than  1.5  per  square  kilometer  in  most  of  the \ncountry.  Due  to  its  large  geographic  area  and  relatively  low  population  density,  Mongolia\u2019s \ntransport  system  is  generally  not  well  developed.  Residents  of  remote  rural  areas  lack \nreasonable access to markets and social services, and are isolated from the country\u2019s political \nand economic centers due to the poor road network. Within Mongolia, the far western aimags1 \nare the most affected. \n \nFurthermore,  Mongolia\u2019s  geographic  location,  far  from  the  sea  and  surrounded  by  two \n3. \nlarge  neighbors\u2014the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  Russian  Federation\u2014makes \nexternal  transport  links via  these  countries  very  significant  in  terms  of  Mongolia\u2019s  international \ntrade.  A  detailed  road  subsector  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2.  To  create  favorable  conditions  to \naccess  the  sea,  improve  the  efficiency  of  transit  transportation  through  the  territory  of  foreign \ncounties,  and  increase  transit  transportation  through  Mongolia,  the  Government  of  Mongolia \n(the Government) has decided to build key roads within Mongolia. The Government\u2019s national \ndevelopment  strategy  based  on  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  identifies  three \nmain road corridors as priority projects for development; all are sections of the Asian Highway \nNetwork.2 The proposed road corridor, which is part of Asian Highway 4 (AH4), between Yarant \nat the PRC border and Ulaanbaishint at the Russian border, is one of the priority development \nprojects for Mongolia and is included in national and regional3 development plans. The Project \nwill develop the road section from Yarant to Hovd aimag center on the proposed road corridor. \n \n4. \nThe  Asian  Highway  Network  is  a  system  of  141,000  kilometers  (km)  of  standardized \nroads  crossing  32  Asian  countries  with  linkages  to  Europe  and  Central  Asia  endorsed  by  the \nUnited  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  AH4  will  join \nMongolia  initially  with  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation,  and  then  continue  to  link  the \ncountry  with  neighboring  Central  Asian  countries  such  as  Kazakhstan.  The  proposed  cross-\nborder linkage will help Mongolia improve its trade with Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of \nthe  PRC  (Xinjiang)  and  Siberia  in  the  Russian  Federation.  It  will  also  help  to  improve  tourism \nand tourism-related businesses in western Mongolia. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n5. \nRoad  Network  in  Mongolia.  Mongolia\u2019s  road  network,  including  both  state  and  local \nroads,  totals  approximately  49,250  km  connecting  21  major  cities  and  towns  and  160  smaller \nvillages (soums [local administrative area] and bags [local administrative subdivisions]). Of this \ntotal,  state  roads  account  for  11,219  km,  and  aimag  and  local  roads  for  38,031  km.  Most \nMongolian roads are gravel and earth; approximately 3.5% of the road network is paved. \n\n                                                 \n1  Provinces. \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2007.

Ulaanbaatar (Summary of the plan is given as \n\nMongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n\nSupplementary Appendix H). \n\n\f2 \n\nWithin the western region, transport infrastructure is limited. Within the two most western \n6. \naimags, Bayan-Olgiy allocates 0.31% of its land for the formal transportation network and Hovd \nallocates 0.2%. These percentages do not take into account the large number of unofficial earth \ntracks.  As  demonstrated  by  an  analysis  of  the  current  makeup  of  the  road  alignment,  of  the \n748.4  km  of  the  proposed  road  corridor,  104.3  km  are  gravel,  181.2  km  are  improved  road \n(earth tracks that have been graded or received some kind of improvement), and 370.35 km are \nearth  tracks.  Only  92.55  km  are  asphalt,  which  includes  64  km  of  road  recently  constructed4 \nfrom the Mongolia-PRC border. The project impact area of phase I comprises Hovd aimag. \n \n7. \nRoad Subsector Financing. The road subsector is financed from the state budget and \nthree  types  of  road  funds:  State  Road  Fund,  21  local  (aimag)  road  funds,  and  Urban  Road \nFund.  In  accordance  with  the  1995  Law  on  Fuel  Tax  on  Gasoline  and  Diesel,  road  fund \nrevenues comprise (i) allocations of a part of fuel taxes on gasoline and diesel; (ii) state budget \nallocations;  and  (iii)  other  donations  and  contributions  such  as  private  donations  to  the \nMillennium Road, fines, fees, and miscellaneous revenue. However, only the State Road Fund \nreceives an allocation from the fuel taxes collected; the other two types of funds depend entirely \non vehicle licensing taxes and allocations from aimag or municipal governments. \n \n8. \nIn recent years, State Road Fund revenues have not been sufficient to meet the needs \nof the Department of Roads of the Ministry of Roads, Transport and Tourism (MRTT). In 2005, \nMNT22.18  billion  were  allocated  to  the  State  Road  Fund.  In  2004,  1.4%  of  Mongolia\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) was allocated to the State Road Fund, but less than 0.3% of the GDP \nwas  used  for  maintaining  the  existing  network,  although  about  1.0%  was  estimated  to  be \nnecessary.  Furthermore,  of  the  road  funds\u2019  expenditures,  maintenance  makes  up  only  about \n25% of the allocations. The rest is spent on new construction and, in the case of the State Road \nFund, counterpart financing for projects funded by international financing institutions.5 External \nassistance to roads in Mongolia is outlined in Appendix 3. \n \nProject Area. Hovd aimag has an area of 76,300 square kilometers and a population of \n9. \n91,687.6 The  altitude  varies  between  1,142  meters  (m)  and  3,750  m.  Hovd  and  Bayan-Olgiy \naimags share a similar climate and set of challenges associated with road construction. Within \nHovd  aimag,  the  main  economic  subsector  is  animal  husbandry,  with  1.96  million  head  of \nlivestock  in  the  region.  After  construction  of  the  project  road,  this  subsector  can  be  improved \nwith the availability of new transport facilities. At present, the region has few mining activities or \nchemical industries that emit air, water, or soil pollutants. \n \nGDP  and  GDP  Per  Capita.  Mongolia\u2019s five western aimags (of which two are crossed \n10. \nby the proposed road corridor)7 have a total population of approximately 400,000, representing \n16%  of  the  nation\u2019s  total.  In  2005,  this  region  had  a  gross  regional  product  of  $138  million, \nrepresenting 7.6% of Mongolia\u2019s overall GDP. In per capita terms, Mongolia\u2019s national GDP in \n2005  was  $724  per  person,  in  the  western  region  GDP  was  $338  (footnote  6).  The  large  and \nbooming  economies  of  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  represent  large  opportunities  for \neconomic growth in Mongolia through increased transit and trade. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  The standard of road construction was the same as that of the proposed project road. \n5  Asian Development Bank. 2007.

Statistical Yearbook of Hovd Aimag 2005. Ulaanbaatar. \n\n7  The proposed road corridor is wholly contained within Hovd and Bayan-Olgiy aimags; the Project (phase I) will be \n\nin Hovd aimag. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nPoverty.  The  overall  poverty  rate  for  Mongolia  is  approximately  32.2%;  37%  in  rural \n11. \nareas and 27.9% in urban. More than one third of the population of the western region (38.7%) \nis  classified  as  poor;  only  20.4%  of  Ulaanbaatar  falls  within  the  same  category.8 Within  the \ncountry,  the  west  has  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of  urbanization,  the  largest  average  household \nsize, and highest dependency ratio, which contribute to the comparatively high poverty.9 Within \nsoums  located  along  or  near  the  project  alignment,  a  2007  sample  survey  of  334  households \nindicates that 20.34% are poverty households, with average monthly income per capita ranging \nfrom MNT17,000 to MNT27,000.10 \n \n12. \nTrade  Flow.  Overall  foreign  trade  for  Mongolia  in  2005  amounted  to  $2.2  billion.  The \nwestern region accounted for $24 million in exports ($5 million to the PRC and $15 million to the \nRussian Federation) and $53 million in imports ($20 million from the PRC and $25 million from \nthe Russian Federation). However, trade flow to the PRC is increasing at a faster rate and, at \npresent, traffic volume at the PRC border is more than three times the volume at the Russian \nborder. Among the regions, Xinjiang has more than $5 billion of exports and just under $3 billion \nof imports. At the same time, east-central Siberia has $21.1 billion of exports and $3 billion of \nimports.  These  numbers  suggest  a  sizable  potential  in  terms  of  western  Mongolia\u2019s  external \ntrade and transit trade between Xinjiang and east-central Siberia. \n \n13. \nPotential  Development  Activities.  A  large  number  of  mineral  deposits  have  been \nidentified in the western region. Most promising and commercially viable are coal deposits; an \nestimated  reserve  of  more  than  300  million  tons  is  located  near  Hovd  aimag  (Khusheet).  The \ncoal and other minerals mined may be exported to the PRC, the Russian Federation, or other \ncountries, resulting in increased foreign reserves and GDP, thereby positively impacting overall \neconomic  development  of  the  country.  The  creation  of  mine  sites  will  impact  surrounding \ncommunities. While the project road is not built to accommodate heavy dump trucks used by the \nmining  industry  and  new  mining  projects  will  need  to  secure  alternate  sources  of  transport  for \nmineral  resources,  no  development  activities  will  take  place  in  the  western  region  without \naccess  to  basic  infrastructure  facilities  to  support  mining-related  services.  Services  such  as \nmedical  facilities,  small  business  enterprises,  and  other  related  establishments  all  need  to  be \nconstructed  or  expanded.  Each  of  these  will  result  in  increased  investment  around  the  mine \nsites. These additional funds will support communities and provide much needed investment to \nincrease the living standards of residents. \n \n14. \nCoal  can  be  used  for  a  wide  variety  of  domestic  purposes  that  positively  impact \ndevelopment.  It  can  be  used  in  power  plants  and  to  provide  heating  to  cities,  villages,  and \nhouseholds throughout the western region. The soums nearby these mines may gain revenue \nas a direct result of mine operations, including land-use taxes and water-use fees. Taking into \naccount  the  fact  that  adequate  transportation  infrastructure  must  be  in  place  to  accommodate \nnew developments such as the establishment of industrial parks to support small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  in  the  region,  described  in  the  Western  Region  Development  Plan,  the \nproposed  road  may  result  in  the  generation  of  new  industries  and  establishment  of  new \norganizations that will increase revenue and employment for local communities. \n \nTourism. The Altai region along the project road is regarded as one of the few virgin or \n15. \nlittle-changed  ecoregions  in  the  world.11 Its  uniqueness  will  attract  more  conventional  tourism. \nVarious national parks, nature reserves, important bird habitat areas, a Ramsar site (convention \n\n                                                 \n8  National Statistics Office. 2007.

Washington, DC. \n10 March 2007 survey conducted by the ADB technical assistance consultant in the project impact area. \n11 Altai region is included in the list of Global 200 by the World Wide Fund for Nature. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\non wetlands), as well as a range of archeological sites have the potential to attract international \ntourists. While infrastructure facilities to develop tourism in the western region are limited, this is \nlikely to change as travel becomes easier and more reliable. \n \nPopulation  Growth.  The  upgraded  road  is  likely  to  slow  emigration  and  lead  to  a \n16. \npopulation increase in the project area as a result of enhanced employment opportunities. The \ndevelopment  of  trade,  tourism,  mining,  and  increased  agricultural  production  will  lead  to \neconomic growth. The annual rate of population increase is expected to be between 1.0% and \n1.5% in the project area. \n \n17. \nAverage  Daily  Traffic  Flow. Along the proposed road corridor, traffic volume is higher \nin  the  south  than  in  the  north.  Traffic  counts  indicate  a  wide  range  of  average  daily  traffic \nvolume,  from  371  near  the  Yarant border  just prior  to  the border  being  closed  for  2  weeks,  to \n156  near  the  Russian  border. 12  The  proposed  road  corridor  will  help  generate  additional \nbusiness activities in the western region and improve the region\u2019s growth rate. This will in turn \nhave a more positive impact on road traffic along the road corridor. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\n18. \nThe  economic  performance  of  the  western  Mongolia  aimags  has  not  been  good  in  the \nlast few years, with per capita GDP in 2005 being less than half of the national average. This \nraises  issues  such  as  the  incidence  of  poverty  given  the  low  average  income  of  all  Mongolia \neven in purchasing power parity terms. Agriculture (mostly livestock) makes up just over 20% of \nMongolia\u2019s economy, but more than 60% of western Mongolia\u2019s economy.13 The area has very \nlittle industry with the exception of meat processing and some small-scale mining, as well as a \nsmall tourism and hospitality industry. \n \n19. \nIn the without-the-road scenario, the economic performance of the western aimags will \ncontinue  to  lag  because  of  structural  weaknesses  and  infrastructure  shortcomings.  Out-\nmigration will continue both to Ulaanbaatar and to Kazakhstan, where ethnic Kazakhs of Bayan-\nOlgiy aimag have established relationships and the petroleum industry is booming. Xinjiang and \nparts of Siberia are also growing rapidly and may attract migrants from western Mongolia. Any \nsignificant  population  growth  is  unlikely  without  improvements  in  infrastructure  and  related \npolicy,  program,  and  project  changes.  Therefore,  the  new  paved  road  can  help  bring  the \ndevelopment potential of the region to reality. \n \n20. \nCustoms  Processing  Times.  At  the  Yarant  border  point,  clearance  times  are \napproximately 3.5 hours, often taking 2 hours on the PRC side and 1.5 hours on the Mongolian \nside. The primary causes of the difference in processing times relate to the relatively inadequate \nfacilities14 and different procedures applied by custom officials of the two countries. \n \n\n                                                 \n12 The  Yarant  border  crossing  at  the  Mongolia-PRC  border  is  closed  from  1  January  to  15  April  and  is  only  open \n\nduring the last 15 days of the remaining months of the year. The Ulaanbaishint border is open all year. \n\n13 National Statistics Office. 2002\u20132006. Mongolian Statistical Yearbook. Ulaanbaatar. \n14 Currently, at Yarant, the PRC is constructing new customs and immigration facilities on the PRC side of the border. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n21.  Mongolia\u2019s  landlocked  location  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation,  and  its \nremoteness  from  developed  international  and  domestic  markets  are  major  constraints  to \ninternational development. The Government of Mongolia has identified increasing investment in \nroad  construction  and  rehabilitation  as  a  means  to  reduce  the  country\u2019s  isolation  from  world \nmarkets and improve the accessibility of isolated communities. The Economic Growth Support \nand  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  identifies  this  emphasis  on  road  rehabilitation  as  one  of  the \nmain  issues.  Improving  the  Western  Regional  Road  Corridor  will  be  a  large  step  forward  in \nreducing geographic isolation within the region. \n \n22. \nThe  project  road  will  help  the  Government  meet  the  objectives  identified  within  its \nComprehensive  National  Development  Strategy  for  Mongolia,  which  is  based  on  the  MDGs. \nAmong these objectives are expanding and developing the road network and connecting aimag \nand regional centers and the capital city by paved roads; improving the care and maintenance \nof  national  and  local  roads;  and  reducing  the  negative  impacts  of  road  vehicles  on  the \nsurrounding  environment,  population,  and  traffic  movements.15 These  goals  and  strategies  are \nin line with the transport sector strategy for Mongolia developed with the assistance of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) (footnote 5).  \n \nThe  Project  supports  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy 16  for  Mongolia  which  focuses  on \n23. \npromoting  stable  economic  growth  and  inclusive  social  development  by  allowing  for  more \nmarket integration and movement of people. This is to result in economic growth and reduced \ngeographic isolation, and thereby reduce poverty. The Project also supports the ADB strategy \nfor the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), which is designed to (i) secure \naccess  to  profitable  markets  in  large  neighboring  countries  for  export  from  the  Central  Asian \nrepublics;  (ii)  reduce  transaction  costs  and  facilitate  transit  and  transport  across  the  region; \n(iii) improve energy supplies for sustaining growth; and (iv) prevent negative regional outcomes, \nsuch as environmental degradation, desertification, human and drug trafficking, and the spread \nof communicable diseases. The CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy endorsed by \nthe  Ministerial  Conference  is  based  on  six  priority  corridors  that  link  various  Eurasian  regions \nand  markets.  By  upgrading  air,  sea,  road,  and  rail  infrastructure  and  services  in  these  priority \ncorridors along with those on secondary access routes, the cost and time of transporting goods \nand  people  will  be  reduced,  and  thus  the  competitiveness  of  CAREC  countries  improved, \nleading to higher sustainable economic growth and improved living standards. The project road \nis part of the CAREC transport corridor number four (AH4). \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (2006\u20132008)  for  Mongolia  reaffirms  the  need  to \nimprove  the  accessibility  of  isolated  communities  addressed  in  the  Economic  Growth  Support \nand Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n \n \n\nLessons \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance \n\n25. \nin  Mongolia\u2019s  road  subsector  has  been  generally \nsatisfactory.  The  first  road  project  for  rehabilitating  the  Altanbulag\u2013Ulaanbaatar  section  was \ncompleted  in  2001  and  rated  as  \u201chighly  successful.\u201d17 Even  with  initial  delays  due  to  limited \n\n                                                 \n15 Millennium  Development  Goals  Based  Comprehensive  National  Development  Strategy  of  Mongolia.  (Draft) \n\n16  ADB. 2006. Mongolia: Country Strategy and Program Update (2007-2009). Manila. \n17 ADB.  2001.  Project  Completion  Report  on  the  Roads  Development  Project  (Loan  1364-MON[SF])  in  Mongolia. \n\nUlaanbaatar. 2007. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fexperience of the contractor and executing agency, the second road project for developing the \nNalayh\u2013Choyr  section  was  successfully  completed  in  2005  and  rated  as  \u201chighly  successful.\u201d \nImplementation of the third road project is ongoing. It has experienced cost overruns due to the \n(i)  increase  in  oil  prices,  which  increased  the  cost  of  transporting  construction  materials  in \nremote  project  sites;  and  (ii)  substantial  increase  in  the  cost  of  construction  materials  in  the \ninternational  market.  Loan  savings  from  the  second  road  project  were  transferred  to  the  third \nproject to meet part of the cost overrun, and the Government undertook to finance the remaining \nbalance. Lessons from the third road project were considered when estimating the cost of the \nproposed Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n26. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  promotion  of  regional  transport  of  freight  and \npassengers via the Western Regional Road Corridor and increased economic development and \nregional  trade.  The  outcome  will  be  an  efficient  and  safe  regional  transport  route  that  is \ndeveloped  in  the  western  region  of  Mongolia,  linking  Xinjiang  in  the  PRC  and  Siberia  in  the \nRussian  Federation,  by  way  of  Hovd  and  Bayan-Olgiy  aimags  in  Mongolia.  The  project  road \nrepresents  a  portion  of  the  AH4,  an  internationally  designated  road  by  the  United  Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n27. \nThe  growth  of  gross  regional  product  for  western  Mongolia  for  2003\u20132005  was  around \n3%; less than 50% of the gross national product for Mongolia (7.5%) for the same period. Once \nthe  Project  is  implemented,  the  gross  regional  product  for  western  Mongolia  is  expected  to \nincrease  at  rates  between  4.5%  and  7.0%  per  year  through  2035.  Additionally,  the  gross \nregional product per capita growth rates are anticipated to range between 4.5% and 5.6% over \nthe  same  time  horizon.  Employment  opportunities  will  increase  and  out-migration  will  decline, \nresulting  in  an  annual  rate  of  population  increase  between  1.0%  and  1.5%.  If  additional \nimprovements are made to the border facilities, growth figures are expected to be even higher. \n \n28. \nIn addition to stimulating economic growth within Hovd aimag, the aims of project road \nconstruction include (i) regional transit trade tonnages increase by 25% during 2007\u20132014 and \n(ii)  trade  between  the  western  region  and  the  PRC  increases  by  15%  during  2007\u20132014. \nSpecific goals relating to transport of passengers and freight along the route include (i) average \nspeed  on  the  road  increases  from  40  km  per  hour  to  60  km  per  hour  by  2013;  (ii)  travel  time \nfrom  Yarant  to  Hovd  aimag  center  decreases  by  3  hours  by  2013;  (iii)  average  border \nprocessing  times  for  goods  and  passengers  at  Yarant  decreases  by  1  hour  by  2013,  and \n(iv) traffic volume at the Yarant border increases by 15% annually from 2012 to 2015. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29.  Main Road. A 748.4 km road stretching from Yarant at the Mongolia and PRC border to \nUlaanbaishint  at  the  Mongolia  and  Russian  border  will  be  developed  in  two  phases.  Under \nphase I, a 431.2 km road from Yarant to Hovd aimag center will be developed. The output for \nthe Project will be the improvement of a 431.2 km road between Yarant and Hovd aimag center. \nThe  road  will  be  built  to  Mongolian  category  III  road  standards  (determined  by  the  traffic \nvolume),  with  two  lanes  and  a  cross  section  consisting  of  carriageway  widths  of  3.5  m  and \nshoulder  widths  of  1.5\u20132.0  m.  This  proposed  cross  section  meets  the  requirements  of  class  II \nroads of the Asian Highway Network (Appendix 4). Implementation of civil works will begin in the \nsecond quarter of 2009 for the first construction package of the project road (Bodonch Canyon \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\narea)  and  be  completed  at  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  2012.  Project  road  construction  will \nbegin in the south and move north, thereby constructing the most heavily traveled sections first. \n \n30.  Maintenance  Centers. Due to its relative isolation and low road network density, road \nmaintenance  management  and  equipment  capability  are  limited  in  the  project  impact  area. \nThree road maintenance centers will be established along the project road (approximately one \nevery  100  km).  In  addition,  facilities  at  the  existing  maintenance  center  will  be  upgraded \n(Appendix  5).  The  maintenance  centers  will  be  tasked  with  the  upkeep  of  the  road,  keeping  it \nfree  from  debris,  potholes,  excess  snow,  and  other  hazards  to  drivers  and  vehicles.  The \ninternational roughness index of the road is not to exceed a value of 4.5. Activities of the new \nmaintenance centers will be undertaken along the project road according to a set  schedule to \nensure that benefits resulting from decreased vehicle operating costs and fuel savings continue. \n \n31. \nEquipment.  To  adequately  maintain  the  surface  of  the  project  road,  the  newly \nestablished road maintenance centers will procure new equipment to supplement the equipment \nof  the  existing  road  maintenance  center.  This  new  equipment  includes  a  grader,  bitumen \nspreaders,  excavator,  asphalt  concrete  cutter,  and  moving  water  tank.  In  addition,  the  Project \nwill provide and install two weigh scales near the PRC border and Hovd aimag center to control \nvehicle  axle  weight  on  the  project  road.  The  Project  will  also  provide  a  vehicle  scanning \nmachine  and  related  equipment  for  the  Yarant  border  crossing  point  at  the  PRC  border  to \nreduce  the  custom  processing  time.  Equipment  to  monitor  environmental  impact  and  control \noverloading will be also procured under the Project (Appendix 6). \n \n32. \nRoad  Safety. Following the upgrade of the road, vehicle speeds are likely to increase, \nresulting in greater potential for accidents. To mitigate against this and other hazards, measures \nsuch  as  the  installation  of  guardrails  where  necessary,  road  signs,  pavement  markings,  rest \nareas,  and  kilometer  posts  are  proposed.  Additionally,  the  project  road  will  be  designed  to \nimprove sight distances, providing drivers with more advance warning of obstacles on the road \nor  approaching  vehicles.  Strict  enforcement  of  axle-load  limits  for  trucks  traveling  along  the \nproject road will improve road safety, as well as extend the life of the road surface. Road safety \naudits at the detailed design and preopening stages will be undertaken to secure road safety on \nthe project road (Appendix 7). \n \n33. \nCommunity  Development.  Along  the  alignment,  community  development  projects  will \nbe undertaken to improve the standard of living and reduce poverty in the project impact area. \nParticipants  in  stakeholder  meetings  suggest  that  training,  such  as  in  driving  to  secure  truck \ndriving  jobs  at  mines  to  be  developed,  be  provided  to  the  unemployed.  Another  common \nsuggestion  is  to  provide  drinking  water  wells  near  soum  centers  for  easier  access  to  clean \ndrinking  water.  ADB  will  review  the  submissions  to  determine  which  community  development \nprojects would have the greatest impact and be most suitable under project funding. \n \n34. \nlocal  road  upgrading  and \nmaintenance in the western region of Mongolia is currently being prepared using seed money \nfrom  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR).  This  grant  would  supplement  the \nimprovement  of  the  project  road  and  result  in  many  local  residents  being  trained  in  proper \nmaintenance  techniques  and  standards.  Following  completion  of  the  JFPR  project,  these \nindividuals  could  be  employed  by  the  regional  maintenance  units, 18  thereby  utilizing  their \nknowledge and training on the project road, further stimulating the local economy. \n \n\nA  $2.0  million  grant  proposal \n\nfor  community-based \n\n                                                 \n18 Each maintenance center is expected to employ approximately 50 workers. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nHIV/AIDS.  Utilizing  outputs  developed  under  a  previous  ADB-funded \n\ntechnical \n35. \nassistance  (TA)19 in  Mongolia,  the  Project  will  include  an  HIV/AIDS20 and  sexually  transmitted \ninfection (STI) training and information component. In the earlier TA, materials were created to \ninform  local  residents  and  construction  workers  of  the  dangers  associated  with  HIV/AIDS  and \nSTI and their transmission. These will be transferred to employees of the Project at no cost by \nthe civil works contractors. \n \n36. \nCapacity  Building.  Increasing  the  length  of  paved  roads  requires  increased  capacity \nand  institutional  strengthening  of  road  administrators  to  secure  road  safety,  to  keep  road \ninfrastructure in good condition, and to provide better services. The Project will support capacity \nbuilding for road maintenance by strengthening financial mechanisms including user charges for \nroad  maintenance,  and  improving  the  institutional  framework  and  organizations  for  road \nmanagement  and  technical  skills  of  road  administrators  of  the  central  and  local  governments. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  capacity  building  to  prevent  overloading  issues,  including \n(i) enforcing the new overloading regulation, (ii) strengthening organizations for enforcement of \nregulations by MRTT inspectors with support of traffic police, (iii) funding two weigh scales, and \n(iv) providing training for road administrators and traffic police. Capacity building assistance will \nbe provided to MRTT, the Executing Agency, for out-of-country training for staff to gain practical \nexperience in road construction and maintenance. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n37. \nRegional  Cooperation.  As  a  large  landlocked  country,  Mongolia  depends  on  its  two \nneighbors,  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation,  for  access  to  world  markets  and  economic \ndevelopment.  The  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  dominate  Mongolia\u2019s  external  trade. \nHowever,  lack  of  roads  leading  to  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  is  a  constraint.  The \nmajority  of  Mongolia\u2019s  external  trade  is  carried  on  the  existing  north\u2013south  rail  line,  which \nconnects  Suhbaatar  at  the  border  with  the  Russian  Federation  and  Zamyn-Uud  at  the  border \nwith the PRC. The ongoing road development along the rail line (footnote 19) will help improve \nMongolia\u2019s flexibility and limited capacity to handle exports and imports with its neighbors. Even \nafter  this  development,  Mongolia  will  have  only  one  paved  road  corridor  connecting  north  and \nsouth. To improve its trade and tourism, Mongolia needs a number of similar road corridors. The \nWestern  Regional  Road  Corridor  is  considered  as  the  next  most  important  trade  link  to \nMongolia.  \n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  develop  a  part  of  Mongolia\u2019s  second  north\u2013south  paved  road  corridor \nlink, which is part of the Asian Highway Network. The route is identified as AH4. From the north, \nthe AH4 will connect western Mongolia to Barnaul and Novosibirsk in east-central Siberia in the \nRussian Federation and from the south it will connect to Urumqi in Xinjiang. Moving westward \nfrom both Barnaul and Xinjiang, the AH4 will connect to several other AH roads that will link with \nCentral Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic. These connections will help \nto link western Mongolia to the entire region.  \n \n39. \nThe  CAREC  program  is  also  playing  a  key  role  in  improving  the  region\u2019s  infrastructure \nand facilitating trade in western Mongolia. Mongolia\u2019s participation in this organization and the \nproximity of other members that are experiencing strong economic growth cycles (e.g., the PRC \nand Kazakhstan) provide increased opportunities for both interregional and international trade. \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2004.

Transport  has  become  a  key \ncomponent of the CAREC Comprehensive Action Plan adopted in October 2006. Following this, \nCAREC confirmed the designation of the AH4 as a CAREC priority transport corridor so that it \nwill receive priority for CAREC trade facilitation support.21 \n \n40. \nThe  main  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  an  efficient  and  safe  regional  transport  route \ndeveloped in Mongolia to link it with both the PRC and the Russian Federation, facilitating the \nflow  of  goods  and  passengers  between  the  three  countries.  As  stated  earlier,  the  Project \nsupports the ADB strategy for Central Asia and is part of the CAREC infrastructure development \nprogram.  \n \nPolicy  Dialogue. In 2005, ADB provided TA22 to MRTT to prepare a national transport \n41. \nstrategy.  The  TA  was  completed  in  mid-2006  and  the  strategy  was  updated  in  March  2007  to \nreflect  MRTT\u2019s  current  plans.  The  transport  strategy  covers  all  subsectors  such  as  road,  rail, \nand  air.  In  parallel,  MRTT  has  prepared  a  15-year  investment  plan  that,  to  a  limited  extent, \ndraws on the strategy. \n \n42. \nThe Government of Mongolia is committed to the United Nations\u2019 MDGs and is preparing \nan MDG-based comprehensive national development strategy for 2007\u20132021. The strategy is to \npromote  the  welfare  of  the  Mongolian  people  and  combines  macroeconomic  and  sector \nstrategies  with  crosscutting  concerns, \nincluding  governance,  human  development, \nenvironmental protection, research and development, and knowledge management. It is based \non  an  assessment  of  achievement  of  the  MDGs,23 and  is  being  drafted  under  the  auspices  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  has  invited  development  agencies  to  actively  participate  in \nstrategy  formulation.  Progress  on  the  strategy  is  reviewed  twice  a  year  by  technical  partner \nmeetings,  to  which  all  major  development  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  are \ninvited.  More  specifically,  sector  working  groups  formed  to  support  formulation  of  the  national \ndevelopment strategy are called upon to report to the technical partner meetings on the status \nof  their  work.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  asked  ADB  to  cochair  the  sector  working  group  on \ntransport, with MRTT acting as chair.  \n \n43. \nAs  cochair  of  the  Transport  Sector  Working  Group,  ADB  conducted  workshops  and  a \nnumber  of  working  group  meetings  to  facilitate  preparation  of  the  transport  sector  action  plan. \nThe other main objectives of these workshops were to strengthen strategic planning in transport \nsector activities, and to discuss the viability of investment proposals presented by MRTT up to \n2021  and  to  prioritize  projects.  As  an  outcome  of  the  meetings,  a  4-year  rolling  plan  is  to  be \nprepared for the sector. MRTT has, in principle, agreed to the need to introduce these strategic \ndirections  in  its  planning  process.  As  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  under  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  agrees  to  establish  a  dedicated  policy  and  planning  division  within  MRTT. \nHowever,  MRTT  is  reluctant  to  scale  down  its  investment  plan  and  is  updating  the  National \nTransport Sector Strategy. ADB will continue its efforts to encourage MRTT to follow a strategic \ndirection and formulate relevant policies in the transport sector.  \n \n44. \nADB  has  continued  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  road  subsector  financing \nand maintenance during preparation of the Project. The Government has agreed to introduce a \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2007. A Trade Facilitation Strategy for CAREC: Preliminary Draft. Manila. \n22 ADB. 2004.

The Government also \nagreed to introduce necessary regulations to control vehicle axle weight on the project road to a \nmaximum weight of 10 tons per axle to prevent overloaded vehicles entering the project road. \nThis policy dialogue will continue as part of negotiations for the proposed grant. \n \n45. \nImpact  on  Local  Communities.  The  Project  is  formulated  to  maximize  the  poverty \nreduction impact on local communities through the community development component. Under \nthe component, local residents will be trained for possible employment opportunities. In addition, \nthe planned $2 million JFPR grant project will improve access to local soum centers, and thus \nimprove access of local residents to markets and social services. The planned JFPR project will \nalso help residents improve their income by participating in road maintenance activities. \n \nRoad Maintenance. To increase the capacity for road maintenance in the project impact \n46. \narea, the proposed ADB grant includes a component to establish three road maintenance units \nwith  corresponding  equipment.  These  units  are  proposed  for  Bulgan  soum,  near  Baga  Ulaan \nPass,  and  Manhan  soum.  At  least  one  of  the  units  is  expected  to  be  contracted  out  to  the \nprivate sector to manage on a test basis. This will encourage private sector participation in the \ntransport sector in Mongolia. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $112.22 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n47. \n$10.06 million (Appendix 8). \n\n \nTable1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nAmount \n\nItem \nInvestment Costsa \nA. \n \n1.

MRTT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the \nProject. MRTT will be assisted by a project steering committee and project implementation unit. \nThe steering committee will be set up at the central level within 3 months of grant effectiveness; \nbe  chaired  by  the  MRTT  state  secretary;  and  comprise  representatives  of  the  ministries  of \nfinance,  foreign  affaires,  health,  MRTT,  nature  and  environment,  social  welfare  and  labor, \ncustoms  general  administration  of  Mongolia  and  Hovd  aimag.  It  will  meet  at  least  once  every \n6 months,  review  implementation  progress,  and  provide  guidance,  as  necessary.  ADB  may \nattend the meetings as an observer. \n \n50. \nA project implementation unit will be established under MRTT to implement activities on \na day-to-day basis. A senior official of the Department of Roads will be appointed as the project \ndirector to head the unit. The project director will be assisted by a full-time project manager and \na team of qualified technical, financial, and administrative staff.24 \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 4.5 years, from 2008 to end of the first quarter of \n\n51. \n2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n52. \nRoad construction will involve three construction packages requiring financing from ADB \nand  the  Government.  In  addition,  a  package  funded  entirely  by  the  Government  comprises \n124 km that have either been recently constructed (64 km), are under construction (40 km), or \nunder  tender  from  the  Government  (20  km)  (Appendixes  10  and  11).  All  ADB-financed \nprocurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe main civil works contracts will be divided into three packages, which will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding and tendered in three batches. ADB and the Government will \nfinance  contract  package  1,  Bodonch  Canyon,  and  package  2,  Baga  Ulaan  Pass\u2013Manhan. \nInvitation  of  bids,  draft  bidding  documents,  and  bid  evaluation  reports  are  to  be  submitted  to \nADB for prior review and approval. Contract package 3 from Manhan to Hovd aimag center is to \nbe financed by the Government. Equipment financed by ADB will be procured through national \ncompetitive  bidding,  which  will  follow  the  Public  Procurement  Law  of  Mongolia  (1  December \n2005, as amended) with clarifications and modifications agreed by ADB and the Government. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Comprising three highway engineers, an accountant, and an administrative assistant.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n53. \nThe  Project  will  finance  92.5  person-months  of  international  consulting  services: 16  for \ndetailed design (financed by the Government), 72 for construction supervision, and 4.5 for other \nservices (financed by ADB). Construction supervision will cover all three contract packages. The \ndetailed design period is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2008 and last for the entire \nyear. The full-time construction supervision consulting services will be required from the middle \nof the second quarter of 2009 and continue until civil works construction ends in the first quarter \nof 2012. During the defects liability period, the consultants are not expected to be needed on a \nfull-time  basis.  The  international  consultants  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  grant  will  be  selected \nand  engaged  based  on  a  full  technical  proposal  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  (80%  technical  and  20%  financial  weighting)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  up  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n54. \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  and  MRTT.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  grant  agreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n55. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payments,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be \nused  for  large  contracts.  If  Government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s \nreimbursement procedure will be followed. To facilitate disbursements, MRTT will establish an \nimprest  account  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  after  grant  effectiveness.  The \nimprest  account  ceiling  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditure  for  the  next  6  months  or \n$200,000,  whichever  is  lower.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds,  the  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish  eligible  expenditures  for  any \nindividual payment not exceeding $20,000 equivalent.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nAn organization chart of the reporting process for the Project is included in Appendix 12. \n56. \nThe  companies  contracted  for  road  construction  will  provide  monthly  reports  on  work \nperformance to the supervision consultants and MRTT, who will then provide any findings based \nupon inspection and verification of work performed to ADB. \n \n57.  MRTT will maintain a separate account for the Project and related financial statements \nand will have them audited annually in accordance with auditing standards consistently applied \nby  independent  auditors,  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are \nacceptable to ADB. MRTT will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal \nyear,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  an  auditor\u2019s \nreport on the Project, all in English. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nand  statement  of  expenditures,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  During  project \nimplementation,  MRTT  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  as  well  as  a  completion \nreport within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n58. \nADB  and  MRTT  will  use  the  project  performance  management  system  to  demonstrate \nthe  effectiveness  of  project  operations,  monitor,  and  be  accountable  for  their  performance  to \nstakeholders. This will be achieved by monitoring performance targets and indicators included in \nthe  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  monitoring  will  use  a  combined  macro  and  micro \napproach,  the  latter  focusing  on  a  few  key  representative  communities  along  the  project \nalignment. The monitoring process will examine key factors such as traffic volume on the project \nroad, progress of development of the local road network, number of accidents, number of poor \nhouseholds  in  each  community,  and  number  of  jobs  that  can  be  directly  attributed  to \nconstruction of the project road. MRTT will monitor and evaluate the project impacts including \npoverty indicators and community development activities, with the assistance of the consultants, \nto  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  managed  effectively.  The  project  performance \nmanagement system is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n59. \nIn addition to regular annual reviews, approximately 20 months after the Project starts, \nMRTT  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  midterm  project  review,  focusing  on  policy,  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  economic,  financial,  and  other \nrelevant  factors  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  project\u2019s  performance  and  its  continuing \nviability. The review will examine progress with reform and compliance with assurances in the \ngrant agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nThe  Project  will  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  the  demand  for  transport  and \n60. \nreduce transport costs, travel time, and accident rates. The development of the proposed road \ncorridor  will  provide  employment  opportunities  during  and  after  construction  and  will  be  a \nconduit for increased economic growth and higher incomes. Annual average daily traffic on the \nproposed road between Yarant and Ulaanbaishint is forecast to grow from 826 passenger car \nunits  in  2013  to  2,309  in  2022,  with  an  average  annual  increase  of  12%.  After  2022,  annual \naverage daily traffic growth is expected to slow to 11% per year, reaching 6,480 passenger car \nunits  by  2032.  The  traffic  projections  consider  the  (i)  growth  in  traffic  during  the  past  6  years, \n(ii) traffic generated by expanded economic activities, and (iii) traffic surveys (Appendix 14).  \n \n61. \nUnder the Project, the Yarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd section of the road will be completed. The \npartial completion of the road corridor is expected to affect cross-border traffic and is projected \nto generate 70% of the total estimated traffic flow for the Yarant\u2013Bulgan section and 50% for the \nBulgan\u2013Hovd section. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n62. \nConstruction  of  the  road  will  provide  a  large  stimulus  to  the  economy  through  the \nestimated $112.22 million project cost. Once the road is in place, the cost of transportation will \nbe  lower,  and  hence,  business  costs  will  be  lower,  providing  an  ongoing  stimulus  to  the \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\neconomy. The cost of imported goods will decrease and the net realization from exports mainly \nconnected with animal husbandry will increase, thereby improving terms of trade for Mongolia. \nMoreover,  as  this  area  of  the  country  has  little  industry  and  almost  no  import-competing \nindustry, very few offsetting losses can be anticipated. Like many developing regions, western \nMongolia has relied on local cheap natural resources as the basis for the little industrial activity \nthat exists. Thus, an abundance of land became the source of a livestock industry, which in turn \nled  to  meat  processing,  fiber  production  (cashmere  and  wool),  and  hides  and  skins.  The \nopportunity for future expansion of the number of livestock is limited because overgrazing and \ndesertification  already  present  problems.  The  new  road  will  improve  the  situation,  as  it  will \nreduce the large number of parallel dirt tracks (up to 100 on some open stretches of the existing \nalignment), which are highly destructive to surface vegetation. \n \nEconomic  viability  mainly  depending  on  projected  traffic  flow  is  more  realistically \n63. \nanalyzed for the entire proposed road corridor rather than phase I (the Project) only. The overall \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated by comparing the project case with a base \ncase. The Project, with shorter travel time, safer design, and better road conditions, will reduce \nvehicle operating costs and accident risks along the corridor. The economic costs are the cost \nof capital, which includes physical contingencies, land acquisition, and the cost of operating and \nmaintaining  the  project  roads,  including  the  replacement  of  depreciated  equipment.  Economic \nbenefits  include  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  resulting  from  the  shorter  distance  and \nimproved road conditions, (ii) time savings for road users, and (iii) trade-related benefits through \ncross-border facilitation. At 16.3% per year, the EIRR demonstrates the economic viability of the \nproposed  road  corridor.  Results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the \neconomic viability. Even with changes in the key variables such as construction costs, reduction \nin  traffic  volume,  and  project  delay  by  1  year,  the  EIRR  is  above  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  The \nresults suggest that costs would need to increase by 49.4% to reduce the EIRR to 12%, while \nbenefits would need to be reduced by 33.1% to reduce the EIRR to 12% (Appendix 15). \n \nFor phase I (the Project) only, under which only the Yarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd section will be \n64. \ncompleted, the EIRR is estimated to be 13.6%, which is still economically viable but lower than \nthe EIRR for the entire proposed road corridor. Although the road is upgraded for the section of \nYarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd  by  the  completion  of  phase  I,  the  amount  of  induced  international  and \nlocal traffic will be affected, compared with the original traffic forecast where the entire road is \ncompleted.  This  will  lead  to  deferment  of  achieving  economic  benefits  and,  in  turn,  forces  the \nEIRR of phase I to be lower than the EIRR of the entire road corridor. \n \nC. \n\nCross-Border Transport Facilitation \n\n65. \nADB  and  its  partners  in  the  CAREC  program  place  a  high  priority  on  trade  facilitation \nbecause of the potential significant gains from increased trade in the region (footnote 21). One \nof  the  main  benefits  from  the  proposed  road  corridor  is  increased  cross-border  trade  among \nMongolia, PRC, and the Russian Federation, which will contribute to regional cooperation and \nintegration under CAREC. CAREC has confirmed the designation of the AH4 route as its priority \ntransport  corridor,  and  the  route  will  receive  priority  for  CAREC  trade  facilitation  support.  As \nagreed  at  CAREC\u2019s  6th  Transport  Sector  Coordination  Committee  Meeting,  Mongolia  will \nimplement  harmonized  cross-border  procedures  at  its  border  crossings.  This  will  significantly \nimprove  the  movement  of  vehicles  across  the  border.  ADB  is  currently  studying  the  details  of \ncross-border trade between Mongolia and the PRC under a regional TA.25 The TA outputs will \nhelp improve cross-border trade between Mongolia and the PRC. Mongolia has already signed \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nbilateral cross-border agreements with the PRC and the Russian Federation, and is expected to \nsign a tripartite agreement as well.  \n \n66. \nTrade figures of the western Mongolia's two neighboring provinces of the PRC and the \nRussian Federation are sizable. In 2005, for all transport methods, the Russian Federation as a \nwhole exported $418 million to Mongolia and $12.9 billion to the PRC ($1.7 billion of which went \nto  Xinjiang).  In  focusing  on  just  the  east-central  Siberian  region,  its  total  exports  amounted  to \n$21.1 billion and imports to around $3 billion. Of these, $38 million were exported to Mongolia, \nwhile  $65  million  were  exported  to  the  PRC.  In  looking  at  goods  flowing  the  other  way,  east-\ncentral  Siberia  imported  $5  million  from  Mongolia  and  $73  million  from  the  PRC.  In  the  east-\ncentral  Siberian  region,  the  main  industries  are  dedicated  to  metals  and  minerals,  synthetic \nrubber,  petrochemicals,  iron  and  steel,  machinery,  and  pharmaceuticals,  all  of  which  can  be \nexported  by  road  to  the  PRC  via  Mongolia.  Food  processing  and  forest-based  industries  are \nalso  present,  but  to  a  lesser  degree.  Western  Mongolia  also  imports  almost  all  of  its  energy \nsupplies from Siberia and needs to expand its energy supplies to sustain its growth. The project \nroad will facilitate easier and more reliable supply of such needs. \n \n67. \nXinjiang has more than $5 billion of exports and just under $3 billion of imports. Xinjiang \nexports  to  the  Russian  Federation  amount  to  $593  million.  The  PRC\u2019s  exports  to  the  Russian \nFederation include agricultural products, manufactured goods such as consumer durables, and \ngarments/textiles.  These  numbers  suggest  a  sizable  potential  in  terms  of  western  Mongolia\u2019s \nexternal  trade  as  well  as  transit  trade  between  Xinjiang  and  east-central  Siberia.  Currently, \nexports  from  the  Russian  Federation  to  Xinjiang  via  road  transport  enter  mainly  through \nKazakhstan. \n \n68. \nAlso  of  importance  for  this  analysis  is  the  fact  that  three  cities  in  east-central  Siberia, \nNovosibirsk,  Barnaul,  and  Biysk,  are  important  transport  and  distribution  centers  with \nNovosibirsk being a hub for rail, air, and road transport; while Barnaul is an important rail and \nroad  center  with  connections  to  the  western  part  of  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan. \nBiysk  is  a  significant  transshipment  point  for  rail  transport.  Goods  that  flow  to  these  locations \nfrom  other  parts  of  the  Russian  Federation  could  be  loaded  into  trucks  for  further  transport  to \nMongolia  or  to  the  PRC  via  Mongolia.  Likewise,  goods  arriving  in  Urumqi  can  be  transported \neast  by  using  the  PRC\u2019s  road  and  rail  network.  Currently,  for  transit  traffic  to  and  from  the \nRussian Federation and the PRC, the options could involve travel through Kazakhstan or central \nMongolia.  However,  transit  through  Kazakhstan  can  be  cumbersome  and  costly  due  to  the \nlonger distance involved. \n \n69. \nAn  improved  paved  road  that  provides  easy  access  to  both  Urumqi  and  Novosibirsk \nwould  reduce  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs.  Some  traffic  that  has  been  using  the \nKazakhstan route could be diverted to the project road. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n70. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  cost  $112.22  million,  with  ADB  providing  $37.6  million,  and \nthe Government providing $74.62 million. Using these funds, the project road will be constructed \nfrom the south to the north, with ADB financing being used for the following sections: Bodonch \nCanyon and Baga Ulaan Pass to Manhan soum. \n \nTo maintain the road so that it does not exceed an international roughness index of 4.5, \n71. \nannual  maintenance  will  be  required  along  with  periodic  maintenance  every  8  years  and \nrehabilitation  every  16  years.  For  the  entire  project  road,  the  annual  cost  of  maintenance  is \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nanticipated to be $0.67 million, with $9.31 million for periodic maintenance and $25.0 million for \nrehabilitation (Appendix 16). \n \n72. \nTo offset costs associated with maintenance and ensure sustainability, a road-user fee is \nproposed  at  the  PRC  border. 26  It  will  be  levied  on  all  vehicles  that  have  not  paid  any  of \nMongolia\u2019s  current  road-user  fees.  The  fee  will  be  fixed  after  considering  factors  such  as \naffordability and type of vehicle. Given the projected traffic volume and estimated user fees of \n$5  for  light  trucks,  $7.50  for  medium  trucks,  and  $10  for  heavy  trucks,  the  annual  amount \ncollected  at  the  border  is  estimated  to  be  higher  than  the  need  for  annual  and  periodic \nmaintenance  and  will  cover  a  major  part  of  the  rehabilitation  cost  as  well.  A  discounted  road-\nuser  fee  may  be  charged  on  Mongolian  vehicles.  Fees  payable  will  be  set  on  an  affordability \nbasis and be reviewed periodically. \n \nE. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n73. \nStakeholder  Consultations.  More  than  6,200  people  were  consulted  during  project \npreparation through household surveys, origin-to-destination surveys, public meetings, business \nsurveys,  and  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA).  Discussions  involved  all  aspects  of \nthe  project  road,  including  benefits  and  other  potential  impacts.  The  consensus  is  that  the \nproject  road  will  positively  impact  the  region  by  reducing  dust  generation,  decreasing \ngeographic isolation, and increasing access to goods and markets. \n \n74. \nSocial  Benefits.  The  construction  and  upgrading  of  the  project  road  will  result  in  the \ncreation  of  a  considerable  number  of  jobs  for  communities  located  along  the  alignment.  The \nProject  is  the  key  to  development  in  Mongolia\u2019s  western  region  and  without  the  Project,  no \ndevelopment activities stated in the Western Region Development Plan will be accomplished as \nno infrastructure facilities are in place for commercial development. The newly created jobs will \nallow households to bring extra income and be trained in road construction and/or maintenance, \nwhich can be applied to future opportunities. Assuming that the contractor will hire 80% of the \nunskilled labor from poor households in the project impact area, 1,040 jobs for the poor will be \ncreated.  Approximately,  200  of  these  unskilled  workers  who  gain  experience  in  road \nconstruction can be absorbed into the road maintenance centers. Further opportunities will arise \nfrom travelers on the road spending money in the soums. The overall result of the road on the \npoor in the project impact area is the elevation of 19.1% of poor households from poverty status \n(Appendix 17). \n \nControl and Mitigation of Epidemic Diseases. As with any road construction project, a \n75. \ndanger  is  the  spread  of  disease  as  a  result  of  bringing  a  mobile  population  of  construction \nworkers  and/or  mobile  professionals  into  the  alignment  communities.  At  the  same  time, \ncommunicable diseases in the local communities could be spread to other areas as workers and \nprofessionals return home. HIV/AIDS is a primary concern, however, its incidence in Mongolia is \nlow. To mitigate against this and other diseases, construction contracts should require (i) only \nlegal  workers  are  employed,  (ii)  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  information  is  provided  to  workers, \n(iii) condoms  are  made  available  to  workers,  (iv) HIV/AIDS  and  STI  testing  is  provided,  and \n(v) HIV/AIDS and STI monitoring will be allowed. \n \n76. \nAs  part  of  earlier  ADB-funded  TA  in  Mongolia  connected  to  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment  Project  (footnote  19),  materials  have  been  developed  for  HIV/AIDS  and  STI \neducation  indicating  their  associated  dangers,  along  with  human  trafficking.  Utilizing  these \nmaterials,  the  TA  benefits  can  be  transferred  to  the  Project  at  very  little  cost.  All  construction \n                                                 \n26 A road user fee at the Russian border will be enforced after completion of phase II of the proposed route. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nworkers  should  be  educated  on  these  topics  and  provided  with  the  previously  developed \nmaterials.  \n \n77. \nEthnic  Minorities. In Hovd aimag, the population of the project area is almost entirely \nMongolian; in Bayan-Olgiy, the population is primarily Kazakh minority. The project road will not \nhave  a  negative  impact  or  make  significant  changes  to  their  livelihoods  or  culture.  To  extend \npositive  impacts  to  local  communities,  the  Project  allocates  $150,000  for  community \ndevelopment activities, and the proposed JFPR project will develop community-based local road \nupgrading and maintenance. \n \n78. \nGender  Impacts.  The  road  upgrading  could  play  an  important  role  in  generating \neconomic growth in the region, thereby increasing opportunities for women and men to generate \nincome  for  their  families  and  achieve  financial  security.  This  increased  revenue  for  local \ngovernments means that kindergartens and other facilities are more likely to be built to enable \nfemale heads of households to work, support their families better, and ensure that their children \nget  an  education.  MRTT  will  ensure  that  all  the  employment  opportunities  will  be  given  and \nMongolian labor standards are applied to everyone regardless of gender. \n \nF. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nThe proposed project road follows an existing earth track alignment. No households will \n79. \nlose land; houses; agricultural plots; crops; trees; fixed assets; business; incomes or livelihoods; \nor access to facilities, services, or natural resources. \n \nG. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Management Plan \n\n80. \nThe Project is environment category A. The EIA was prepared and a summary EIA for \nthe  Project  was  circulated  to  the  Board  on  17  August  2007.  The  EIA  assesses  the \nenvironmental impact of selected alignments of the project road and prescribes environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  measures,  valued  at  $1.47  million.  Discussions  with  the  World  Wide \nFund  for  Nature,  Wildlife  Conservation  Society,  and  Specially  Protected  Area  Administration \nDepartment  in  Ulaanbaatar  indicate  that  the  project  road  will  have  little  impact  on  existing \nwildlife and their migratory patterns, primarily because the road corridor is an existing alignment \nthat has been used for many years. Project implementation is expected to positively impact the \nenvironment  by  reducing  dust,  decreasing  soil  degradation,  eliminating  multiple  earth  tracks \ncurrently  being  utilized,  and  contributing  to  economic  development  of  the  region.  To  minimize \nthe impact of the Project on environmental aspects, the Ministry of Nature and Environment will \nsupervise and monitor the environmental aspects. Capacity of the ministry will be strengthened \nby providing 36 person-months of national consulting. \n \nH. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n81. \nThe  Government  has  given  assurance  that  phase  II  of  the  project  road  will  be \nimplemented  in  2010.  Failure  to  do  so  may  result  in  reduction  of  the  anticipated  economic \nbenefits of the Project. \n \n82. \nThe  project  design  considers  potential  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  social  risks. \nThe main technical risks are associated with road construction in the Bodonch Canyon area and \nweather-related conditions. To minimize the technical risks, (i) the proposed alignment through \nBodonch  Canyon  has  been  rerouted  to  reduce  the  earthworks  and  blasting  needed;  (ii)  slope \nprotection  measures,  retention  walls,  and  permafrost  protection  are  proposed;  (iii)  road  safety \n\n \n\n\fequipment  will  be  installed;  and  (iv)  additional  bridges  will  be  constructed  to  facilitate  river \ncrossings. With  regard  to  weather,  the  design incorporates  standards of  the  Mongolian-issued \nRoad Climatic Zones and Geotechnical Conditions. \n \nThe  social  risks  primarily  involve  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  transmission.  To  mitigate  against \n83. \nthese risks, construction contracts will contain clauses providing means for providing HIV/AIDS \ninformation  and  testing,  and  stating  that  workers  who  violate  the  rules  and  regulations  will  be \nimmediately  terminated  and  subject  to  prosecution  if  laws  have  been  broken.  Appropriate \nmitigation  measures  to  counter  these  risks  are  in  place  in  the  social  development  action  plan \nand  the  environmental  management  plan.  MRTT  demonstrated  a  high degree  of  ownership  in \npreparing and committing to implementation of these action plans. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n84. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n85. \nCounterpart  Financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  funds  and  resources \nnecessary  for  construction,  operation  and  maintenance,  and  management  of  the  Project  are \nprovided  in  a  timely  manner.  The  Government  will  take  all  necessary  measures,  including  the \nprovision  of  additional  funds  to  ensure  that  the  Project  is  successfully  implemented,  managed \nand operated after construction is completed. \n \n86. \nDevelopment  of  Phase  II.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  funds  are \nallocated to phase II of the proposed road corridor and implementation of phase II is started not \nlater than 31 December 2010.  \n \n87. \nConstruction  Quality. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that (i) the project \nroad  is  constructed  in  accordance  with  national  technical  standards;  (ii)  project  construction \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  conducted  in  accordance  with \nnational  standards  and  internationally  accepted  practices;  (iii)  ongoing  civil  works  under \ngovernment financing are executed in accordance with national technical standards; and (iv) the \ncompleted sections of the project road are adequately maintained. \n \n88. \nEnvironment.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is \ndesigned, constructed, and operated in accordance with environmental laws and regulations of \nthe  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the  EIA,  and  summary  EIA;  (ii)  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  the  mitigation  measures  included  therein,  as \nspecified in the EIA and summary EIA, are properly implemented; (iii) the EMP is updated at the \nengineering  design  stage,  and  incorporated  into  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts; \n(iv) any adverse impact on the environment that may arise from project implementation activities \nis promptly mitigated or minimized in accordance with the EMP; and (v) implementation of the \nEMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of  environmental  standards,  and  corrective \nmeasures taken thereto, is reported at least semiannually to ADB. \n \n89. \nCommunity  Development. The Government, through MRTT, will manage and monitor \ncommunity development activities proposed under the Project by the project implementation unit \nand agreed by ADB. \n \n90. \nLocal  Employment.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  will  cause  the  contractors  to \nemploy  unskilled  workers  from  local  areas  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor  people, \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nincluding  ethnic  minorities,  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  and \nmaintenance of the project road. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that such workers \nare provided with adequate on-the-job training. \n \nLabor Standards. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that all the employment \n91. \nand labor standards provided in the applicable laws and regulations of Mongolia are complied \nwith, and in particular, that all civil works contractors engaged under the Project will (i) provide \ntimely payment of wages on at least a monthly basis; (ii) provide safe working conditions to all \nworkers,  with  such  requirements  being  included  in  the  civil  works  contracts  and  monitored  by \nthe  construction  supervision  consultants;  (iii)  provide  employment  opportunities  to  women  and \nethnic  minorities,  where appropriate,  and  pay  equal  wages  to  male  and  female  employees  for \nwork of equal value; and (iv) do not employ child labor in the project works. \n \n92. \nHealth  Risks.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  in  coordination  with  the  appropriate \nagencies identified by the Government, will cause the contractors to disseminate information on \nthe  risks  of  STI,  including  HIV/AIDS,  to  their  employees  during  project  implementation.  MRTT \nwill cause the appropriate agencies to disseminate similar information to transport operators and \nlocal communities living in the project area during project implementation and operation of the \nproject  road.  The  Government,  through  MRTT  will  cause  contractors  to  monitor  health  risk \ncontrol. \n \n93. \nCommercial  Development  in  the  Project  Area. To ensure that the expected benefits \nof  the  Project  are  channeled  through  to  the  local  community,  the  Government  will  start \nimplementing the Western Region Development Plan approved by the cabinet on 28 September \n2005  for  soums  and  aimag  centers  along  the  project  road  within  2  years  after  completion  of \nconstruction of the project road. \n \n94.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  will  monitor  and \nevaluates  the  project  impacts  including  poverty  indicators  and  community  development \nactivities,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  to  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are \nmanaged effectively and the benefits, particularly to the poor, are maximized. The Government \nwill cause MRTT to (i) employ a qualified domestic institute, prior to project implementation, to \ncarry  out  the  monitoring  activities;  (ii)  ensure  that  local  governments,  including  local  statistics \noffices,  collect  the  data  to  measure  the  relevant  indicators  prior  to  and  during  project \nimplementation, at completion, and annually 3 years thereafter, with the frequency as specified; \nand (iii) submit to ADB the reports summarizing the key findings of monitoring. \n \n95. \nResettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  entail  any  land \nacquisition and/or resettlement. In the event of any unforeseen resettlement, (i) the Government \nwill inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and regulations, and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  and  (ii)  civil  works  will  not  start  until  ADB  has \nreviewed and approved the resettlement plan. \n \n96. \nEthnic  Minorities.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  have  any \nadverse  impact  on  the  livelihood  of nomadic  herders  and  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  project \narea.  In  the  event  of  any  unforeseen  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  nomadic  herders  and  ethnic \nminorities,  (i)  the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  plan  according  to  relevant  laws \nand  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998);  and  (ii)  civil  works  will  not \nstart until ADB has reviewed and approved the plan. \n \n\n \n\n\fAnticorruption  Measures.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s \n97. \nAnticorruption Policy and the Government\u2019s anticorruption policy will be followed. MRTT will also \nensure,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  regulations  and  requirements,  during  project \nimplementation  that  (i)  appropriate  officials  are  resident  in  the  project  offices  for  bidding, \nconstruction,  and  operations;  (ii)  an  internal  audit  unit  is  established  within  MRTT;  (iii)  a  two-\ncontract  system  is  adopted  where  the  winner  of  a  civil  works  contract  must  also  sign  an \nanticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  and  (iv)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  is \nundertaken to ensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are followed. MRTT will \ninitiate  liaison  meetings,  if  needed,  to  discuss  warnings  about  or  information  on  corrupt \npractices. \n \n98. \nControl  of  Axle  Weight  of  Vehicles. Before opening of the project road to the public, \nthe  Government  will  introduce  necessary  regulation  and  take  necessary  measures  to  control \naxle  weight  of  vehicles  on  the  project  road  to  a  maximum  weight  of  10  tons  per  axle,  and  to \nprevent overloaded vehicles entering the project road after its completion. \n \nRoad User Fees and Maintenance. The Government will ensure that all collected road-\n99. \nuser  fees  are  directly  used  for  the  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road  and  the \nproject road is well maintained after its completion. In the event that road-user fees collected are \ninsufficient  for  the  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road,  the  Government  will \nundertake maintenance work by allocating adequate funds from the Government budget. \n \n100.  Cross-Border  Trade.  The  Government  will  take  necessary  measures  to  implement \nharmonized  cross-border  procedures  at  Yarant  by  31  December  2012  and  ensure  that  the \nborder crossing will be open to the public all year around without restricting the border crossing \nto residents and citixens of Mongolia and the PRC.  \n \n101.  Capacity  Building.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  policy  and  planning  division  is \nestablished in MRTT within 2 years after grant effectiveness. The Government, through MRTT, \nwill manage and monitor capacity building activities proposed under the Project and agreed by \nADB. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n102. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $37,600,000  to  Mongolia  for  the  Western \nRegional Road Corridor Development Project\u2013Phase I from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n31 January 2008 \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nPromotion of regional \ntransport via the \nWestern Road Regional \nCorridor and increased \neconomic development \nand regional trade  \n \n\nOutcome \nAn efficient and safe \nregional transport route \nis developed in the \nwestern region to link \nMongolia with the \nXinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region in \nthe People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and Siberia in \nthe Russian Federation. \n \n\nOutputs \n1.

Mongolia\u2019s  road  network,  including  state  and  local  roads,  totals \napproximately  49,250  kilometers  (km)  connecting  21  major  cities  and  towns  and  160  smaller \nvillages (soums [local administrative division] and bags [rural administrative subdivision]). Of this \ntotal,  state  roads  account  for  11,219  km.  The  remaining  38,031  km  are  aimag  [province]  and \nlocal  roads,  classified  as  earthen  tracks.  Asphalt  roads  account  for  2,278  km  (4.6%),  gravel \nroads 1,980 km (4.0%), and improved earth roads approximately 1,868 km (3.8%) of the total \nlength of the road network. \n \n2. \nDespite the impressive growth rate in vehicle ownership in recent years, Mongolia\u2019s road \ninfrastructure  lags  far  what  is  needed.  In  terms  of  road  density  and  percent  of  paved  roads, \nMongolia  is  close  to  the  lower  end  of  the  countries  worldwide  (Figure  A2).  In  terms  of  vehicle \nownership,  Mongolia  is  very  close  to  the  midvalue  of  vehicles/1,000-people.  To  support \ndemand, Mongolia must improve its road density and paved roads to reach international norms \nindicative of the relative development of its road subsector. \n\n \n\nFigure A2: Mongolian Road Subsector in Perspective \n\n         Range in the World\n\nMid-Value\n\nRoad Density(km/sq.km)\n\n0.01 0.03\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\n4.9\n\nMongolia\n\nPRC\n\n% Paved Roads\n\n2.5\n\n  3.5\n\n45.5\n\n78.7\n\n100\n\nMongolia\n\nPRC\n\nNo of 4+ wheel \nVehicles/1000 people\n\n0.2\n\n26.2\n\n42.4 45.8\n\n933.1\n\n \n\nPRC\n\nMongolia\n\nkm = kilometer. \nSource:  Prepared  by  TERA  International  Group,  Inc.,  from  published  national  statistics  in  the  PRC  and \nMongolia. Minimum, maximum, and midrange values for the world are from the World Bank website \non roads and highways overview entitled \u201cWhat does the average road subsector look like?\u201d \n\n \nRoad  Subsector  Strategy.  The  initial  national  transport  strategy  for  Mongolia  was \n3. \nprepared  in  1999  with  World  Bank  assistance.  The  Government  revised  its  national  transport \nstrategy in 2006 with ADB assistance. The updated national transport strategy aims to provide \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nsafe, dependable, effective, efficient, and fully integrated transport operations and infrastructure \nto support the social and economic development of the nation by meeting the needs of freight \nshippers and passengers. This will be achieved by improving service and minimizing costs in a \nmanner  that  supports  Government  objectives  for  economic  and  social  development.  All \nimprovement  measures  will  be  environmentally  and  economically  sustainable.  In  addition,  the \nnational  transport  strategy  proposes  to  improve  transport  system  efficiency  by  enhancing \nregional transport arrangements. The strategies for roads include (i) providing all-weather road \nconnections  to  aimag  capitals  and  major  points  to  neighboring  countries,  (ii)  improving  the \nprimary  network  by  rehabilitating  and  maintaining  the  primary  road  network,  (iii)  planning  and \nprioritizing large investments required to rehabilitate the road network, (iv) reviewing road user \ncharges and establishing a new and efficient system, (v) promoting private sector participation, \nand  (vi)  increasing  road  user  representation  by  participating  in  the  Road  Management  Board. \nThe  national  strategy  supports  development  of  the  Project,  and  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals include the proposed road corridor as one of the key development projects for Mongolia. \n\n4. \nRoad Subsector Funding. The road subsector is financed by road funds and the state \nbudget. Although the creation of road funds was a significant and important step, their structure \nhas  created  inequity  in  the  system.  At  present,  three  types  of  road  funds  are  in  place:  State \nRoad Fund, 21 local (aimag or provincial) road funds, and an Urban Road Fund. Only the State \nRoad Fund receives an allocation from the fuel taxes, the other two depend entirely on vehicle \nlicensing taxes, other municipal taxes, and an allocation from aimag or municipal governments. \nFurthermore,  fund  expenditures  are  not  restricted  to  road  maintenance,  which  is  the  evident \nneed. Expenditure on maintenance makes up only about 25% of allocations, the rest is spent on \nnew construction and, in the case of the State Road Fund, counterpart financing for international \nfinancing institution-funded projects. \n\n5. \nIn  recent  years,  road  fund  revenues  have  improved  but  still  are  not  sufficient  to  meet \nrequests of the Department of Roads. In 2005, MNT22,180 million was allocated to the funds. \nAccording to the Department of Roads, this was 82% of what was actually requested. As shown \nin  Table  A2.1,  from  2002  to  2005  funding  for  roads  ranged  from  63%  to  87%  of  the  amount \nrequested by the Department of Roads. \n\nFreight  Transportation.  The  road  portion  of  total  freight  volume  and  turnover  has \n6. \ngenerally increased as a percentage since 2001 (Table A2.2). The dramatic leap in road freight \nvolume and turnover in 2003 appears to reflect an adjustment by the National Statistical Office \nin the volume of road traffic. By 2005, the road subsector accounted for 38.2% of freight shipped \nand 3.0% of freight turnover. \n \n7. \nPassenger Transportation. At the national level, road transport accounted for 97.7% of \npassengers  carried  and  about  23.7%  of  passenger  turnover  in  2005  (Table  A2.3).  The  high \npercentage for passengers carried is due to the inclusion of commuter traffic in Ulaanbaatar and \nother cities. This traffic has low trip distances, which explains the low passenger turnover share \nin relation to the share of passengers carried. \n \nRoad Transport Demand. Table A2.4 summarizes the actual transport sector demand \n8. \nfor 2005 and projected demand for 2015 by road, rail, air, and inland waterways. The estimates \nfor  roads  include  urban  transport,  which  currently  represents  the  bulk  of  road  freight  and \npassenger  transport  demand.  From  2005  to  2015,  road  transport  demand  is  expected  to \nincrease  by  6.5  times  in  terms  of  tons  and  9.6  times  in  terms  of  ton-km.  The  corresponding \ngrowth for passengers is 2.1 and passenger-km 4.2.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nTable A2.1: Funding Requested and Received by the Department of Roads  \n(MNT million) \n\n2002 \n \n\n2003 \n \n\n2004 \n \n\n2005 \n \n\n \n\n Item \n \nA.

This  category  of  road  is \nmade up of two-lane, undivided roads with an average volume of traffic, and a design speed of \n100  kilometers  (km)  per  hour  (h),  80  km/h,  or  60  km/h,  depending  on  the  terrain.1  The  cross \nsection involves lanes of 3.5 meters (m) width and 1.5 m shoulders on each side. The proposed \ncross section and road design standards are consistent with standards for class II highways of \nthe Asian Highway Network. \n\nThe  road  is  proposed  to  have  a  design  life  horizon  of  2013\u20132032,  with  traffic  volume \n2. \nexpected \nthese  projections,  \n5-centimeter  (cm)  asphalt  concrete  surface  course  pavement  is  recommended,  with  the \nfollowing pavement design. \n\nto  reach  4,841\u20135,573  vehicles  per  day  by  2032.  Given \n\n3. \nExisting  Road  Segments.  Inventory  and  condition  surveys  were  carried  out  for \n21 existing road subsections ranging in length from 12.4 km to 73.2 km. Two of the inventoried \nstretches (from Yarant to Uyench and near Hovd) are paved with asphalt; one section is gravel \nroad.  With  the  imprint  of  maintenance  activities  such  as  culvert  renovation,  raising  of \nembankment and grading can be seen. In many stretches, side drains are blocked or eroded. \n\n4. \nThe remaining road sections are categorized as earth or improved earth road. Some of \nmay  have  had  selected  earth  covers  earlier,  which  have  not  been  replenished  and  graded.  In \nterms  of  their  present  condition,  they  are  to  be  treated  as  earth  roads  only.  The  earth  road \nsegments have poor capacity for transport traffic and are liable to be bypassed through the use \nof  parallel  unformed  tracks  (except  in  approaches  to  passes  and  bridges,  where  traffic  is \nconstrained  to  use  the  existing  earth  roads).  The  sections  with  improved  road,  with  the \nexception of the Bodonch Canyon area, do not have drainage ditches. \n\n5. \nOf the 431.2 km road length, currently, 83.8 km is asphalt (including the 64 km from the \nborder  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  to  Uyench  River),  12.4  km  is  gravel,  121.5  km  is \nimproved road, and the remaining 213.5 km is earth road. \n\n6. \nAlternative  Alignments.  In  the  preliminary  road  design,  alternative  alignments  were \nproposed  and  considered  throughout  the  corridor.  The  first  is  located  between  Bodonch  and \nManhan. The selected alignment includes two mountain passes and was found to be a cheaper \nand  shorter  alternative  than  the  longer  and  flatter  option  to  the  east.  The  second  alternative \nalignment is located in Hovd city,  where the options include constructing the road through the \ncity  or  bypassing it.  The  bypass  option  was  selected,  meaning  the  road  will  pass  Hovd  city  to \nthe  east,  as  this  option  eliminates  land  acquisition  issues,  utilizes  a  19  km  section  of  existing \nasphalt pavement, and keep trucks out of the city center. \n\n7. \nBridges  and  Culverts.  Along  the  431.2  km  alignment,  construction  of  32  new  bridges \nand rehabilitation or reconstruction of 12 existing bridges is proposed. Of these, 27 new bridges \nwill be constructed in the Bodonch Canyon section. In this same section, all 8 existing bridges \nwill  be  rehabilitated  or  reconstructed.  Due  to  the  narrow  canyon,  the  presence  of  Bodonch \nRiver,  and  the  limited  sight  distances  in  this  section,  the  alignment  has  been  altered  to \nincorporate new bridges, thereby increasing safety. Additionally, this new alignment will reduce \nthe amount of earthworks and blasting needed to construct the road. \n\n                                                 \n1  In flat areas, the design speed is 100 km/h; in rolling areas 80 km/h, and in mountainous areas 60 km/h. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29\n \n\nCurrently, 81 culverts are located along the project road, including 57 in the package to \n8. \nbe  funded  solely  by  the  Government.  Of  this  total  number,  22  culverts  will  need  to  be \nreconstructed  and  an  additional  35  new  culverts  installed.  Following  the  reconstruction  and \ninstallation of these culverts, the total number along the alignment will increase to 116. \n\n9. \nImpact of Weather and Construction Season. The project road from Yarant to Hovd is \nlocated in an area of diverse climatic conditions. Roads in this region can be covered with sand \nand  snowdrifts  due  to  strong  winds,  soil  erosion  can  occur  due  to  rain  and  snow,  and  vast \nvariations of cold and hot weather all affect the road and its surroundings. Hence construction \nworks can only be carried out during a limited seasonal window. Construction is generally only \npossible 5\u20136 months of the year. Throughout the alignment, asphalt pavement work is limited to \nMay\u2013September, while earthwork is limited to May\u2013October. \n\n10. \nHot versus Cold Asphalt. In considering the surface for the project road and the limited \nperiod throughout the year for construction, the potential for using cold asphalt was considered. \nAfter  reviewing  the  two  options,  hot  asphalt  was  selected.  This  method  results  in  greater \nstrength and less maintenance over time, thereby reducing overall maintenance costs. The use \nof  cold  asphalt  would  lengthen  the  construction  season,  but  its  disadvantages  outweigh  the \nbenefits derived from extending the construction season. \n\nRoad  Maintenance.  To  ensure  that  the  road  surface  is  sustained  at  an  international \n11. \nroughness  index  value  not  to  exceed  4.5,  maintenance  procedures  must  be  implemented.  In \naddition  to  routine  maintenance  ($1,562  per  km),  periodic  maintenance  will  be  required  every \n8 years  at  $24,900  per  km  and  rehabilitation  every  16  years  at  $69,420  per  km.  For  routine \nmaintenance along the entire road, $0.67 million is needed per year, while periodic maintenance \nwill  require  $9.31  million  every  8  years  and  rehabilitation  $25.0  million  every  16  years.  The \nfinancial analysis appendix discusses proposed payment measures (Appendix 16). \n\nCurrent road maintenance management and equipment capability within the project area \n12. \nis  in  the  early  stage  of  development  due  to  the  area\u2019s  remoteness  and  low  road  network \nintensity. The one maintenance center is located in Hovd, which is traversed by the project road \nand  is  responsible  for  road  maintenance.  Equipment  for  the  road  maintenance  center  was \nprocured primarily from the Russian Federation and has been in use for approximately 20 years. \n\n13. \nTo increase the capacity for road maintenance in the project impact area, the proposed \nADB grant includes a component for establishing three maintenance centers with equipment in \nBulgan soum, near Baga Ulaan Pass, and Manhan soum. Two are expected to be government \nowned, and the third privately owned. \n\n14. \nRest  Areas.  According  to  Mongolian  Design  Standard  32-01-00,  rest  areas  are \nmandatory  on  all  arterial  roads  and  should  include  some  or  all  of  the  following  amenities: \nparking areas for cars, trucks, and other vehicles; potable water supply; toilets; picnic shelters, \ntables, and benches; public telephones; information facilities; lighting; and other amenities. Rest \nareas  should  be  spaced  at  intervals  of  50\u201380  km.  While  these  rest  areas  will  be  sited  and \ndetails  developed  during  the  detailed  design  phase  of  the  project  road,  six  rest  areas  are \nproposed along the alignment. This number includes the welcome center at the border with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nROAD MAINTENANCE CENTERS \n\n \n1. \nThe  highest  priority  for  roads  over  the  past  few  years  has  been  maintaining  the  road \nsystem.  This  is  still  far  from  complete  but  is  receiving  attention  by  international  organizations. \nLarge  economic  losses  in  terms  of  increased  vehicle  operating  costs  and  reduced  economic \nproduction and development will result if the existing road infrastructure is allowed to continue to \ndeteriorate.  The  maintenance  of  the  state  roads  is  a  priority  because  they  are  essential \neconomic growth corridors both for domestic and international trade (including serving as part of \nthe  trans-Asia  network  and  providing  direct  access  to  international  gateways),  while  providing \nmechanisms  for  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  regional  development  objectives  via  improved \nintegration and communication within Mongolia. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  economic  factors,  proper  road  maintenance  is  key  to  securing  road \n2. \ntransportation  services  in  the  project  area  due  to  the  natural  characteristics  of  western \nMongolia.  The  proposed  project  road  is  situated  in  the  high  mountainous  area  of  the  western \nregion. Roads can be covered with sand and snowdrifts due to strong winds; soil erosion at road \nembankments can occur due to rain and snow; rockfalls can endanger road users traveling at \nmiddle/high speed near steep and rocky hills; vast variations of cold and hot weather affect road \nusers,  road  infrastructure,  and  surroundings;  and  the  steep  gradient  causes  surface  water  to \nflow rapidly carrying small stones that block drainage. The influence of storms during the spring \nand  fall  is  greater  than  in  other  regions  of  the  country  and  slush  can  often  occur,  causing \nvehicles to slide. Additionally, due to summer rainfall, periodic floods can be expected.  \n \n3. \nCurrent road maintenance capability in the project area is inadequate to cover increasing \nrequirements for road servicing because or the relative isolation and low road network density. \nTo remedy this, road maintenance centers will be established along the proposed project road \napproximately  every  100  kilometers:  in  Bulgan  Soum,  Baga  Ulaan  Pass,  and  Manhan  Soum. \nThe international roughness index of the road will not exceed a value of 4.5 at any given time, \nthereby ensuring that benefits resulting from decreased vehicle operating cost and fuel savings \nwill continue. \n \n4. \n \n\nMajor responsibilities of the maintenance centers include the following: \n\nMaintain pavement, base course, and subbase course; prevent sliding pavement, \nprovide surface dressing, repair cracks, and provide overlay and rehabilitation. \n\nPatrol,  remove  snow,  spread  sand  on  icy  roads,  and  support  stuck  vehicles \nduring winter with special attention to pass areas such as Baga Ulaan Pass. \n\nInspect drainage facilities, and provide necessary maintenance work if these are \nblocked or damaged. \n\nClear rockfalls and check/repair the road infrastructure such as slope protection, \nretaining walls, and revetment structures at least twice a month or more in pass \nareas with steep slopes, such as Bodonch Canyon. \n\nCheck  culverts  with  hillside  ditches  and  provide  repair  work  especially  at \nBodonch  Canyon;  flash  floods  can  cause  soil  erosion,  and  water-coved  roads \nand floods can occur during spring and summer. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n31 \n\nEQUIPMENT FOR THE PROJECT \n\nThree  sets  of  light  equipment  for  road  maintenance  will  be  procured  for  the  road \n\n \n1. \nmaintenance centers at a total estimated cost of $250,000 (Table A6.1). \n \n\nTable A6.1: Equipment for Maintenance Centers  \n\nUnit Price ($) \n10,000 \n\nQuantity \n1 \n\nTotal ($) \n10,000 \n\nEquipment \n\nSmall grader (small land leveler grader) \nSmall tractor for moving required \nequipment (capacity: 80 horsepower) \nHand bitumen spreader (with heater) \nHand asphalt cutter \nHand compactor \nMoving water tank \nMini track, 3 tons \nPickup for workers \nMoving compressor \nMini loader (excavator) \n  Subtotal \nOffice for workers (approx. 70 m2) \n\nSubtotal (for one maintenance unit) \n\n15,000 \n\n4,000 \n2,000 \n1,050 \n4,000 \n5,000 \n6,000 \n1,500 \n20,000 \n \n6,400 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n \n1 \n \n \n\n15,000 \n\n4,000 \n4,000 \n2,100 \n4,000 \n10,000 \n6,000 \n1,500 \n20,000 \n76,600 \n6,400 \n83,000 \n250,000 \n\n \n\n \n\nNo. \n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n \n11 \n \n \n\nTotal (for 3 units) \n\n \nm2 = square meter. \nSource: Ministry of Road Transport and Tourism. \n \nTo  reinforce  the  overloading  regulation,  two  weigh  scales  will  be  procured  at  a  cost  of \n2. \n$35,000  each,  for  positioning  near  Mongolia\u2019s  border  crossings  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina, and Hovd. \n \nThe project highway will increase access to the project area, where endangered animals \n3. \nsuch  as  Saiga  (an  antelope)  exist.

The number \nof  accidents  increased  nearly  7  times  between  1995  and  2006,  from  860  to  5,911.  Fatalities \nfrom  road  accidents  in  urban  areas  increased  by  28.6%;  injuries  increased  by  approximately \n46.2%.  In  rural  areas,  accidents  increased  by  27.7%,  while  deaths  remained  relatively \nunchanged and injuries increased by 34.2%. Rural areas accounted for approximately one fifth \nof  total  accidents  and  two  thirds  of  deaths  nationally.  In  this  respect,  rural  areas  are  a  more \nsignificant source of road accident fatalities. \n \n2. \nThe analysis of national data on accidents and vehicle ownership shows that while the \nnumber  of  accidents  per  1,000  vehicles  increased  more  than  27.7%  in  the  12-year  period, \ndeaths  per  1,000  vehicles  decreased  by  9.3%  and  injuries  by  7.1%.  In  terms  of  severity, \nnational statistics show the following trend: deaths resulting from accidents between 1995 and \n2006 remained relatively unchanged (0.34 and 0.33); injuries decreased from 1.01 to 0.25. \n \n3. \nThe  Road  Law  and  Road  Transport  Law  detail  the  duties  and  functions  of  each \nadministrative  level  to  ensure  that  roads  are  properly  maintained  and  the  traffic  flow  is  well-\nmanaged and safe for the general public. \n \n4. \nRoad  Safety  Issues.  With  the  exception  of  the  southernmost  64  kilometers  at  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2013Mongolia  border  and  short  sections  passing  through  Hovd  and \nOlgiy and at the Russian Federation border, the project road is not paved, making vehicle travel \ndifficult, particularly for large trucks crossing the mountain passes. Road safety is a concern in \nhilly and mountainous areas as vehicles try  to maneuver around bends where sight lines may \nbe limited. \n \nIn  populated  areas,  speeding  vehicles  and  the  presence  of  pedestrians  and  livestock \n5. \nunwary  of  oncoming  traffic  pose  a  safety  threat.  With  the  proposed  road  upgrading  and \nimprovement, both traffic volume and speed will increase, correspondingly heightening the risk \nof road accidents.  \n \n6. \nThe  road  segment  from  Bulgan  soum  [local  administrative  division]  to  the  junction  for \nMust soum is approximately 170 kilometers and covers a wide range of topography. It includes \na river crossing of Uyench River, currently without a bridge; a river valley along Bodonch River \nwith  nine  bridges  crossing  the  river;  and  a  2,860-meter  mountain  pass.  The  alignment  of  the \nsection  has  numerous  very  sharp  horizontal  curves  with  limited  sight  distances  in  narrow \nsections. This road segment will require alignment modifications to provide a wider carriageway \nand better horizontal radii and sight distances. \n \n7. \nDue  to  hilly  and  mountainous  terrain,  rockfalls  may  occur  in  some  areas.  These  are \npotentially  hazardous  to  vehicles  that  try  to  avoid  them.  In  certain  areas,  structural  measures \nmay be necessary such as riprap revetments, rock cladding, or retaining walls.  \n \n8. \nSafety  railings  or  post  barriers  are  generally  absent  in  the  winding  segments  of  the \nproject  road.  At  a  minimum,  adequate  additional  width  or  wider  sections  at  road  bends  is \nneeded to accommodate turning vehicles. \n \n9. \nRoad Safety Improvement Proposed under the Project. To improve road safety along \nthe  project  road,  several  road  safety  measures  should  be  considered  and  included  in  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n33 \n\ndetailed engineering design phase and in safety plans during construction and after placing the \nroad in service. These measures should be considered necessary components of the Project.  \n \n10. \nRoad  Safety  Audit.  Road  safety  audits  are  needed  at  the  detailed  design  stage  and \npreopening stages. A road safety audit is a formal examination of an existing or future road; the \nmain objective is to ensure a high degree of safety for all new highway schemes before projects \nare  implemented  and  before  any  accidents  happen.  A  qualified  team  reports  on  the  accident \npotential and safety performance.  \n \n11. \nRoad  Signage  and  Markings.  Road  signage  and  markings  are  used  to  impart \ninformation  to  road  users  as  guides  and  for  safety  purposes.  In  most  cases,  these  signs  are \nstandard  and  graphical,  and  are  usually  placed  at  visible  spots  for  easy  recognition  and \nunderstanding,  as  well  as  to  warn  drivers  of  road  conditions.  Traffic  markings  are  painted \ninformation  features  on  the  road  pavement  and  may  be  in  addition  to  traffic  signs  along  the \nroadside.  Most  pertinent  to  safety  are  danger  warning  signs  that  alert  drivers  to  possible  road \nhazards  and  to  the  need  to  be  more  cautious.  These  may  refer  to  road  conditions,  terrain, \ncurvature, or environmental conditions. Signs also show the direction of traffic flow and parking \nplaces,  and  identify  points  of  interest  including  rest  areas.  Rest  areas  combined  with  service \nfacilities (i.e., parking lot, fuel and vehicle maintenance station, communication center, sanitary \nequipment, hotel, or restaurant) are integrated in the road construction. Visibility of these road \nsigns  at  a  sufficient  distance  is  important.  As  the  project  road  will  include  international  traffic, \ninternational standards for signage and markings along the alignment should be adopted.  \n \n12. \nRoad  Safety  Fences,  Barriers,  and  Sidewalks.  In  addition  to  super  elevation,  road \nsafety  guardrails,  crash  barriers,  safety  barriers,  and  fences  are  commonly  used  in  elevated \ncurved  segments  of  the  road  as  added  safety  infrastructure  to  prevent  vehicles  from  sliding \ndown  slopes.  These  railings  and  barriers  should  be  of  approved  materials,  preferably  with \nconcrete  posts  to  prevent  vehicles  from  rolling  over.  Posts  should  be  painted  for  easy \nrecognition  and  serve  as  driving  aides  when  visibility  is  reduced.  One  example  of  where \nguardrails  or  barriers  are  needed  is  at  the  exit  of  Havchig  valley  near  Hovd  city,  where  a \ndangerous hill has numerous bends and sharp curves. In urban areas, sidewalks are necessary. \n \nLighting Requirements. To enhance road safety at night, road illumination is needed. \n13. \nHowever,  since  most  of  the  road  runs  through  uninhabited  areas,  this  is  not  practical.  Street \nlamps will be provided in certain urban segments of the road. Certain illumination requirements \nmust be provided in the detailed engineering of the road segments in urban areas to provide for \nthe general safety of residents. \n \n14. \nGeneral  Site  Work  Safety  Requirements.  At  the  site,  adequate  measures  should  be \nestablished  to  prevent  accidents.  Contractors  should  submit  the  work  safety  plan  to  the \nsupervising engineer. The plan must include safety of the public and work personnel, property \nprotection, and sanitary and environmental measures. Safety plans should include how to deal \nwith  emergency  situations  at  the  work  site.  The  plan  should  be  comprehensive  and  be \ncommunicated  to  every  member  of  the  work  force,  including  subcontractors.  Safety  officers \nshould be designated to ensure compliance with safety requirements, and safety notices should \nbe posted at construction sites. Protective fencing should be installed for the safety of residents \nin the area, as well as safe passageway for people and livestock. \n \nThe  contractor  is  also  expected  to  effectively  liaise  and  maintain  open  communication \n15. \nwith  neighboring  villages  regarding  safety  measures  and  procedures.  Guards  should  be \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\ndesignated  and  apprised  of  safety  requirements  in  the  construction  area  and  tasked  with \ninforming the public about safety. \n \n16. \nTraffic  Control  during  Construction.  Prior  to  construction,  signs  should  be  posted  to \nnotify  drivers  of  proposed  activities,  including  necessary  information  regarding  speed,  traffic \ndirectional flow, and dates of activities. Work personnel should be designated to direct traffic. If \ndetours will be used, adequate directional signs should be in place. The detour road should be \nadequate  for  slow-moving  traffic  and  be  safe  and  properly  maintained  for  drivability.  Road \nbarricades should be set up to separate traffic lanes from lanes under construction. Reflective \npaints should be used for better visibility. During road construction in urban areas, one half of \nthe  road  is  typically  closed  while  the  other  half  remains  open  to  traffic.  At  the  same  time, \nconstruction  materials  will  be  hauled  to  the  site  and  construction  workers  will  be  present. \nPrecautionary  measures  should  be  taken  to  protect  everyone\u2019s  safety,  including  posting  signs \nwarning drivers that construction is ongoing and that they should reduce speeds and be alert. \n\n17. \nSafety  Requirements  during  Operation.  In  addition  to  the  infrastructure  safety \nmeasures,  road  safety  plans  for  road  users  should  be  established,  and  communication  and \ncoordination by the maintenance contractors should be established with aimags (provinces) and \nsoums.  Public  education  and  awareness  of  traffic  regulations  will  be  promoted  and  supported \nthrough enhanced and consistent enforcement to encourage improved safety for all road users. \nTraining  will  be  needed  to  ensure  implementation  and  enforcement  of  road  safety  measures. \nTraffic police and road administrators of the local governments from aimags and soums should \nbe trained in traffic management and road safety. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\nTable A8.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($ million) \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n43.69 \n1.90 \n0.00 \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n% of Total \nProject \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n35.10 \n2.80 \n0.15 \n\n78.79 \n4.70 \n0.15 \n\n70.21 \n4.20 \n0.13 \n\nA. \n \n \n \n\nInvestment Costsa \n1.

The first is to set firm goals and monitor \ntheir  achievement  during  implementation  to  ensure  achievement  of  the  maximum  positive \nimpact for potential beneficiaries. One year after project completion, assessment of whether the \ngoals  were  achieved  is  equally  important,  and  provides  input  for  future  projects.  If  the  goals \nwere  unrealistic,  they  will  need  to  be  modified  for  future  projects.  Alternatively,  problems  may \nresult from the approach and methods used rather than the goals.  \n\n2. \nThe second objective is to ensure that the Project does not inadvertently bring harm to \nthose affected by it. As a result, a series of social protections are planned to be implemented. \nSuccess in avoiding harm must also be monitored and evaluated. \n\n3. \nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Project  (Appendix  1)  provides  a  broad \ncontext  within  which  monitoring  of  socioeconomic  impacts  in  the  project  impact  area  will  be \nconducted.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system  (Table  A13)  provides  the  monitoring \nstructure for the Project within which socioeconomic monitoring will be conducted. \n\n4. \nBaseline  Data.  To  measure  the  project\u2019s  impact,  baseline  data  on  the  project  impact \narea  was  collected  during  the  household  and  village  surveys  carried  out  during  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance.  The  data  should  be  sufficient  to  test  economic  and  social \nimpacts, including such categories as average monthly income, average number of animals per \nhousehold, household assets, average monthly savings, and number of poor households. \n\nProject  Monitoring.  Many  of  the  targeted  outputs  are  jobs  created  for  local  residents \n5. \nand  workers  from  poor  households.  This  data  should  be  collected  from  the  construction \ncontractors on an annual basis to monitor whether targets are being met and to take corrective \nmeasures  as  necessary.  District  governments  should  be  asked  to  record  the  number,  size, \nturnover,  and  tax  revenue  from  businesses  formed  to  serve  the  construction  work  camps  and \ncompany  staff.  They  should  also  describe  the  extent  of  informal  income-generating  activities \nserving  the  workers,  and  physical  assets  the  construction  contractors  have  provided  to  local \ncommunities. This information should be provided in an annual report to the Ministry of Roads, \nTransport and Tourism. \n\n6. \nTo  monitor  the  social  protection  objectives,  each  district  government  should  submit  a \nbrief  annual  report  certifying  that  work  camp  inspections  were  made  and  noting  any  problems \ndetected  and  corrected.  They  should  also  provide  a  report  of  public  awareness,  testing  and \ncounseling programs related to HIV/AIDS1 and other communicable diseases conducted at the \nwork camps, and in what manner condoms have been made available to workers and to local \nresidents in the vicinity of work camps. These reports will be reviewed to determine if corrective \nmeasures are needed to ensure the health of workers and local communities. \n\n7. \nProject  Evaluation.  After  completion  of  construction,  annual  survey  should  be  carried \nout  along  the  alignment  for  three  years.  The  results  should  be  reviewed  to  determine  the \neconomic, social, and poverty impacts of the Project. The survey should be accompanied by a \nparticipatory review of impact with villagers, local officials, local businesses, and passengers. In \naddition  to  the  village  and  household  surveys,  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \ncarried  out  origin  and  destination  passenger  surveys  and  industry  surveys.  Comparing  these \nsurveys  with  traffic  along  the  upgraded  road  will  provide  a  broad  review  of  whether  the \n\n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n43 \n\nanticipated traffic was accurate. The industry surveys gathered considerable data on industries \nin the area and their anticipated growth records. This information will provide the baseline for a \nrepeat  interview  process  to  determine  the  impact  of  road  upgrading  on  industry  in  the  project \nimpact area. \n\n8. \nImpact on Poverty. Using the records of the soums (local administrative subdivisions) \nand  aimags  (provinces)  will  provide  an  initial  evaluation  of  whether  infrastructure  construction \nprojects  can  have  a  sustainable  impact  on  raising  households  above  the  poverty  threshold. \nAbout 1 to 2 years after completion of construction, baseline data will be available on a group of \nworkers,  records  of  several  social  and  economic  interventions  to  address  factors  leading  to \npoverty, records of training and counseling provided regarding planning for future employment \nor business activity, issues encountered in the transition period and implementing the long-term \nplan,  and  success  achieved  in  the  first  year  of  new  employment  or  other  type  of \neconomic/business activity. Some of the data will be quantified and some will be subjective, but \nit  will  provide  a  useful  view  of  the  capacity  of  infrastructure  projects  to  lift  and  sustain \nhouseholds  out  of  poverty.  It  will  provide  a  useful  pilot  that  can  be  applied  by  interested \nprovinces  and  districts  for  future  infrastructure  projects.  It  will  also  provide  useful  input  for  the \nMinistry  of  Roads,  Transport  and  Tourism  and  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on  how  to \nstructure projects for maximum sustainable poverty reduction impact. \n\nThe number of jobs created as a result of the project road will have a significant impact \n9. \non the poor in the project impact area. Of the approximately 13,502 poor, 2,674 would directly \nbenefit  from  road  upgrading.  Given  this  level  of  benefits,  more  than  19%  of  poor  households \nwould  be  elevated  from  their  current  poverty  status.  When  taking  the  secondary  benefits  into \naccount, such as positive impacts on tourism, mining, and other sectors, the impact on poverty \nis anticipated to be even greater. Through community development projects funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, local residents may receive training in vocational skills, such as driving or \nmachine repair, that will enable them to be employed and improve their overall livelihood. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \nItem \nSustainability \n\n \nMonitoring \nTool \n\nSocioeconomic \nmonitoring report \n \n\nTable A13: Project Performance Management System \n \n\nMajor Indicators to Be Monitored \n(Baseline and target figures to be incorporated \ninto the project administration memorandum)  \n\nPopulation, poverty incidence, literacy rate \nUpdate of poverty reduction program of each \ndistrict \nGross regional product, gross regional product \nper capita, retail prices of a selection of \ncommodities  \nNumber of registered enterprises \nProgress of development of local road network   \nNumber of HIV/AIDS cases in the project area  \n\n \nMonitoring \nAgency  \nMRTT \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMRTT \n \n\n \nAccountable \nAgency \nMRTT \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMRTT \n \n\nViability \n\nOperation report \n\nMRTT \n\nMRTT \n\nTraffic volume  \nNumber of accidents \n \n\nAudited financial \nstatement, \naudited project \naccounts \n\nAudited project accounts  \nAudited financial statements of MRTT \nExternal auditor's checklist  \n\nEIAA \n\nMRTT \n\n \n\nNotice \n\nNotice to proceed, notice of provisional and final \nacceptance of the facilities  \n\nMRTT \n\nMRTT \n\n4\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\n \nReporting Frequency \nSubmission Due Date \nAnnually  \n \nAt beginning of the \nProject \nAt project completion  \n3 years after project \ncompletion  \n  \nThe indicators will be \ncollected for the \nfollowing groups: \nsample on-route \ndistricts, districts, and \nprovinces. \n  \nAt beginning of the \nProject \nAt project completion  \n3 years after project \ncompletion  \n \nAudited financial \nstatement = Same as \noperation report \nAudited project \naccounts = Same as \nquarterly progress \nreport \n \nWithin a reasonable \ntime  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \nItem \nSustainability \n\n \nMonitoring \nTool \n\nMajor Indicators to Be Monitored \n(Baseline and target figures to be incorporated \ninto the project administration memorandum)  \n\nEnvironmental \nmonitoring and \nevaluation report \n\nImplementation of erosion protection plan \nReplanting of slope vegetation and trees to \nprotect flow at culverts and other natural \ndrainage features \n\n \nMonitoring \nAgency  \nTo be \nnominated \n\n \nAccountable \nAgency \nMRTT \n\n \nReporting Frequency \nSubmission Due Date \nSemiannually until 2 \nyears after provisional \nacceptance  \n \n\nTechnical \nFeasibility \n\nQuarterly \nprogress report \n\nImplementation schedule \nContract award \nDisbursements \nPhysical progress by contract  \nUpdate of project cost estimate  \nNumber of poor for unskilled local labor \nWorkers safety/accidents at construction sites \n\nMRTT \n \n \n\nMRTT \n\nAll \n\nMidterm review \n\nEvaluation of various aspects of project \nimplementation including technical, \nenvironmental, resettlement, social, institutional, \neconomic and financial, and sector performance \n \nEvaluation of various aspects of project \nimplementation including technical, \nenvironmental, social, institutional, economic \nand financial, and sector performance \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MRTT = Ministry of Road, Transport and Tourism; EIAA = external independent auditing agency. \nSources: ADB and technical assistance consultant estimates. \n\nProject \ncompletion report \n\nMRTT \n\nMRTT \n\nMRTT \n\nMRTT \n\nAll \n\n \n\nQuarterly until the \nquarter in which \nphysical completion \ntakes place, or the \ngrant account with ADB \nis closed, whichever is \nlater.

Approximately,  495  interviews  were  conducted. \nThe  results  of  these  traffic  counts  are  presented  in  Table  A14.1  with  comparison  to  the \nprefeasibility study. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Feasibility Study and Prefeasibility Study of Traffic Flow  \n(average daily traffic) \n \n\nPrefeasibility Study (2005) \n\nFeasibility Study (2006) \n\nSection \nYarant (Bulgan)\u2013Hovd \nHovd\u2013Olgiy \nOlgiy\u2013Russian Federation Border \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n75 \n150 \n120 \n\n371 \n218 \n156 \n\n \n2. \nThe difference between the prefeasibility and feasibility studies is mainly attributed to the \nborder  closure  during  the  prefeasibility  study.  The  feasibility  study  was  conducted  with \nconsideration of two substantial changes from the prefeasibility study. That is, traffic flows were \ncaptured when the border was open and a section of the project road had been upgraded by the \nMinistry of Roads, Transport and Tourism. The traffic count data from 2001 to 2006 undertaken \nby  the  Road  Supervision  and  Research  Center  were  closely  examined  in  the  feasibility  study. \nAgainst the feasibility study baseline, traffic is projected as presented in Table A14.2. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Traffic Projection with the Project \n \n\nYear \n\n2006 \n2013 \n2017 \n2022 \n2027 \n2032 \n\nYarant\u2013Bulgan \nPCU \nADT \n368 \n278 \n1,043 \n591 \n1,667 \n989 \n2,958 \n1,844 \n5,059 \n3,272 \n8,347 \n5,573 \n\nBulgan\u2013Hovd \nPCU \nADT \n313 \n234 \n937 \n503 \n1,497 \n846 \n2,660 \n1,587 \n4,557 \n2,829 \n7,541 \n4,841 \n\nHovd\u2013Olgiy \n\nADT \n168 \n362 \n610 \n1,146 \n2,047 \n3,506 \n\nPCU \n201 \n702 \n1,104 \n1,928 \n3,264 \n5,351 \n\nOlgiy\u2013Ulaanbaishint \nADT \n156 \n405 \n658 \n1,193 \n2,080 \n3,501 \n\nPCU \n205 \n621 \n972 \n1,690 \n2,855 \n4,681 \n\n  ADT = average daily traffic, PCU = passenger car unit. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3. \nThe traffic analysis indicates that along the project road, traffic volumes are higher at the \nsouthern than the northern end. The latest data suggests that western Mongolia, being poorer \nthan  other  regions  of  the  country,  may  have  a  higher  income  elasticity  of  demand  than  other \nregions. Against this backdrop, traffic in the affected area after the project road is constructed is \nexpected  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  more  than  10%  (Table  A14.3).  The  annual  average \ngrowth rates up to 2013 are higher than those after 2013 mainly because of transit trade growth \nprojections. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n47 \n\nTable A14.3: Traffic Growth Forecast along the Project Road \n \n2013 \n1,043.0 \n16.0 \n937.0 \n17.0 \n702.0 \n19.6 \n621.0 \n17.2 \n\nItem  \nYarant\u2013Bulgan \n  Average annual growth (%) \nBulgan\u2013Hovd \n  Average annual growth (%) \nHovd\u2013Olgiy \n  Average annual growth (%) \nOlgiy\u2013Ulaanbaishint \n  Average annual growth (%) \n\n2017 \n1,667.0 \n12.4 \n1,497.0 \n12.4 \n1,104.0 \n12.0 \n972.0 \n11.9 \n\n2022 \n2,958.0 \n12.2 \n2,660.0 \n12.2 \n1,928.0 \n11.8 \n1,690.0 \n11.7 \n\n2027 \n5,059.0 \n11.3 \n4,557.0 \n11.4 \n3,264.0 \n11.1 \n2,855.0 \n11.1 \n\n2006 \n368 \n \n313 \n \n201 \n \n205 \n\n  \n\n2032 \n8,347.0 \n10.5 \n7,541.0 \n10.6 \n5,351.0 \n10.4 \n4,681.0 \n10.4 \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nForecasting  of  the  traffic  flow  to  be  generated  through  cross-border  facilitation  used  a \n4. \nconservative  approach.

This  benefit  comes  through  reduced  vehicle \nrunning  time  as  a  result  of  smoother  pavement.  Vehicle  operating  cost  savings \nfor normal and generated traffic in the first year of road opening are estimated at \n$0.30 per kilometer (/km) for heavy trucks, $0.20/km for buses and $0.05/km for \ncars. \nPassenger  travel  time  savings.  The  average  speed  on  the  project  road  is \nassumed  to  be  60  km/hour,  while  travel  speeds  are  40  km/hour  without  the \nproject case. Against this backdrop, travel time savings are estimated at a rate of \n$0.41/hour. \nTrade-related  benefits.  These  mainly  comprise  (a)  generated  international \ntransit  traffic,  (b)  increased  western  Mongolian  international  trade,  (c)  customs \nmodernization, and (d) generated tourism. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  results  show  that  the  proposed  road  corridor  remains \neconomically viable under the adverse scenarios tested (Table A15.2). The economic viability is \nconsidered  to  be  robust  as  the  EIRR  values  are  well  above  12%  in  the  sensitivity  analysis \ncases. The worst case scenario, which seems unlikely, suggests that the proposed road corridor \nwould still meet the 12% rate of return under extreme circumstances. In addition, the switching \nvalues  for  construction  costs  and  traffic  growth  for  each  option  were  calculated.  The  results \nsuggest that costs would need to increase by 49.4% to reduce the EIRR to 12%, while benefits \nwould need to be reduced by 33.1% to reduce the EIRR to 12%. \n\n \nTable 15.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\nItem \n\nBaseline: \nScenario: \n  1.

Considering  that  the  share  of  international  transit  traffic  generated  benefits  is \naround  40%,  the  estimated  direct  benefits  of  the  Mongolia  component  were  considered.  The \nEIRR  without  benefits  from  internationally  generated  traffic  is  12.9%  (Table  A15.2),  indicating \nthat the proposed road corridor would be viable even without internationally generated traffic. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\nTable A15.3: Distribution of Benefits of the Proposed Road Corridor (%) \n \n\nType of Benefit \nDomestic Traffic \nInternational Transit Traffic Generated \nCustoms Modernization \nTourism Generated \nWestern Mongolian International Trade Increased \nDomestic Travel Time \nTotal \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nShare of Total Benefits \n43.7 \n39.7 \n7.5 \n4.4 \n3.4 \n1.4 \n100.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEconomic Analysis for the Project \n\n \nD. \n \n6. \nConsidering that the proposed road corridor will be developed with a phased approach, \nan analysis of the EIRR for the first three construction packages the Project (phase I) (Yarant\u2013\nBulgan\u2013Hovd)  was  undertaken  (Table  A15.4).  The  analysis  indicates  that  phase  I  is \neconomically viable but the EIRR is lower than that for the proposed road corridor as a whole. \nAlthough  the  road  is  upgraded  for  the  Yarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd  section,  the  amount  of  induced \ninternational and local traffic will be smaller than the traffic forecast under the assumption for the \nwhole road corridor.

Once they \ncan be measured, the projected EIRR could be much higher. Taking into account the fact that \nan  adequate  transportation  infrastructure  must  be  in  place  to  develop  mining  industry,  the \nproposed  road  may  result  in  the  generation  of  new  industries  and  establishment  of  new \norganizations that will result in added revenue and increased employment for local communities. \n \n8. \nAlthough  only  an  open  pit  tungsten  mine  (Khovd  Gol)  is  currently  operating  in  western \nBayan-Olgiy, a silver deposit near Tsagaannuur in northeastern Bayan-Olgiy is being evaluated \nand may be developed within the next several years. The silver mine (Asgat) has a reserve of \napproximately  2,300  tons,  but  is  located  in  a  remote  area  that  is  not  easily  accessible.  Most \npromising  and  commercially  viable  is  a  coal  deposit  with  an  estimated  reserve  of  300  plus \nmillion tons, which is located near Hovd aimag (Khusheet). The coal and silver mined may be \nexported to the People\u2019s Republic of China, Russian Federation, or other countries, resulting in \nthe  increase  of  foreign  reserves  and  gross  domestic  product,  thereby  positively  impacting  the \noverall economic development of the country. The development of mines will positively impact \nemployment in the region. Skilled and unskilled labor will be needed to mine the silver or coal, to \nprovide support services to the mine, and to transport the minerals to their ultimate destination. \n \n9. \nDomestically, the coal can be used for a wide variety of purposes that positively impact \ndevelopment.  It  can  be  used  in  power  plants  and  to  provide  heating  to  cities,  villages,  and \nhouseholds  throughout  the  western  region.  The  soums  (local  administrative  subdivisions) \nnearby these mines may gain revenue as a direct result of mine operations, including land use \ntaxes  and  water  use  fees.  The  creation  of  mine  sites  will  also  positively  impact  surrounding \ncommunities.  Services  such  as  medical  facilities,  cafes,  bars,  hotels,  gas  stations  and  repair \nfacilities,  and  other  related  establishments  will  need  to  be  constructed  or  expanded.  Each  of \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nthese businesses will result in increased investment around the mine and the continual flow of \nfunds  being  directed  to  them  throughout  the  lifespan  of  the  mine.  These  additional  funds  will \nsupport the communities and provide much needed investment to increase the living standards \nof area residents. \n \n10. \nAlthough tourism infrastructure remains limited, this will likely change as travel becomes \neasier  and  more  reliable  with  improved  access.  As  the  Altai  region  along  the  project  road  is \nlisted as one of the virgin or little changed ecoregions in the world,1 its uniqueness will provide \nattractions  for  more  conventional  tourism.  Various  national  parks,  nature  reserves,  important \nbird habitat areas, a Ramsar site (convention on wetlands), as well as a range of archeological \nsites  also  have  potential  to  attract  international  tourists.  Jet  service  between  Ulaanbaatar  and \nHovd began recently, reducing the flight time between the cities from over 4 hours to 1.5 hours, \nwhich is also likely to contribute to tourism. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Altai region is included in the list of Global 200 by the World Wide Fund for Nature. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n53 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \nThe  individual  road  sections  are  consolidated  into  three  construction  packages  of \ncontiguous  sections.  In  addition,  a  package  including  road  sections  that  may  not  require \ninternational  financing  institution  funding  is  included  in  the  financing  plan  to  indicate  the  full \namount of Mongolian Government contributions to the entire road improvement project. \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  financing  for  the  $112.22  million  project  road  includes  $37.6  million \nequivalent  grant  financing  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  (33.5%  of  the  total  cost) \nand $74.62 million equivalent from the Government (66.5% of the total cost). \n\n3. \n\nThree types of maintenance work must be financed after completion of the Project:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nroutine  annual  maintenance  such  as  pothole  repair,  crack  sealing,  guardrails, \ndebris removal, and snow removal; \nperiodic  maintenance  (every  8  years),  such  as  major  surface  treatments \n(e.g., chip seal); and \nrehabilitation  of  the  wearing  surface  to  include  scarification  of  the  surface  and \napplication of complete overlay (every 16 years). \n\n \nThe existing road user fees and taxes collected throughout Mongolia can be considered \n4. \na  road  user  contribution  to  the  cost  of  road  maintenance  and  development.  However,  a  new \nroad user fee is needed to capture non-Mongolian registered traffic utilizing the project road. \n\nIn  determining  the  value  of  the  road  user  fee,  the  annual  funding  needed  for  road \n5. \nmaintenance must be examined along with the volume of traffic expected to pay the fees. The \nannual  cost  for  maintenance  is  $0.67  million  ($1,562  per  kilometer  [km]),  with  $9.31  million \nneeded every 8 years and $25.00 million every 16 years. The rate structure for road user fees \ncollected at the border should be structured so that these maintenance costs are covered by the \nfees.  Assuming  a  road  user  fee  of  $5  for  light  trucks,  $7.50  for  medium  trucks,  and  $10  for \nheavy  trucks,  and  based  on  the  traffic  projections  at  Mongolia\u2019s  borders  with  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China,1 the road user fees will equal the needed routine maintenance costs before \n2013. The surplus fees collected each year will be applied to additional costs for periodic and \nrehabilitation  maintenance.  The  cumulative  surplus  will  be  sufficient  to  fully  cover  the  periodic \nand rehabilitation maintenance costs, eliminating the need for additional Government funds. \n\nConstruction  of  the  project  road  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  2013,  meaning  that \n6. \nperiodic  maintenance  will  be  required  in  2020  and  rehabilitation  will  be  required  in  2028. \nAssuming  that  traffic  flows  grow  at  a  steady  rate  between  2013  and  2031  (Table  A16.1),  the \ncumulative  user fee surplus between 2013 and 2021, when combined with the road user fees \ncollected  in  2022,  is  sufficient  to  fully  cover  the  periodic  maintenance  cost.  With  the  same \nassumptions,  the  surplus  accumulated  between  2023  and  2029  would  fund  the  costs  of \nrehabilitation in 2030, when combined with the road user fees collected in that year. \n\nFinancial  Management  Assessment.  The  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transport  and  Tourism \n7. \n(MRTT)  has  accumulated  sufficient  experience  in  managing  and  disbursing  ADB  funds  in  the \nlast  5  years  and  as  a  result,  has  established  an  appropriate  organization  structure  for  project \nimplementation  and  fund  management.  ADB  accounting  procedures  that  are  adhered  to  in \nMongolia  define  the  preparation  and  approval  of  transactions  and  grant  utilization  reports,  as \nwell as the duties and limits of the project implementation unit authority. In accordance with the \n                                                 \n1  Similar road user fees will be enforced at the Russian Federation border after the completion of phase II. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nMongolian  Accounting  Law,  MRTT  follows  international  accounting  standards  and  the  ADB \nresident mission conducts training for project finance and accounting staff at least twice a year. \nThe  MRTT  accounting  policy  was  developed  with  ADB  technical  assistance;2  the  accounting \nstaff  follows  procedure  manuals  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  policy.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nIn  the  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (2003),  the  Government  of  Mongolia  emphasizes  road \nnetwork  development  because  roads  play  a  significant  role  in  accelerating  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  In  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (2006\u20132008) for Mongolia, road development is identified as \nimportant  for  regional  market  integration  and  facilitating  the  movement  of  people,  goods,  and  services  thus  leading  to \neconomic development and poverty reduction.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Poverty Classification: General intervention \nAccording  to  the  national  household  survey\u2014the  2006  household  income  and  expenditure  survey\u201432.2%  of  Mongolia\u2019s \npopulation  is  living  below  the  poverty  line  and  38.7%  in  the  western  region.  In  Bayan-Olgiy,  53%  of  the  population  have \nmonthly consumption expenditure below the poverty line of MNT20,200 and in Hovd 46%. According to the social survey of \nthe project area, all aimags (provinces) rank the rehabilitation of international and local access roads as a top priority in their \ndevelopment agenda. Due to the proximity to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russian Federation, Bayan-Olgiy and \nHovd aimags import about 75% of their energy, food, consumer goods, and construction materials from the two countries. The \nProject will greatly contribute to improved linkages to markets in the PRC, Russian Federation, and Kazakhstan through the \nRussian Federation; and improved access to industrial and tourism employment opportunities and social services. The Project \nwill lead to lower transport costs, better access to deliver essential goods from neighboring economies to local communities, \nand employment opportunities during construction. The following are common issues in the area related to poverty:  \n\n(i)  High unemployment. Lack of job opportunities is one of the main issues. In the western region, the unemployment \nrate was 5.3% in 2004, compared with 3.6% in the country. No significant industry is currently in place to boost the \nregional economy.  \n\n(ii)  Poor  medical  facilities.  Every  soum  (local  administrative  division)  has  trained  medical  assistants  and  primary \nhealth care centers with minimal facilities. However, problems still remain because of the lack of modern facilities for \nspecial  treatment  at  clinics  and  hospitals,  nurses  and  doctors  have  not  been  fully  trained  in  modern  treatment \ntechniques, and costs for medical treatment are higher for poor households in the region.  \n\n(iii)  Unsecured  drinking  water  resource.  In  Bayan-Olgiy  aimag,  12.8%  of  households  have  access  to  water  from \nwater  distribution  stations,  compared  with  94.5%  of  households  in  Hovd  aimag;  the  remainder  use  water  from \nnatural (unprotected) sources such as springs, rivers, and lakes.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Strategy to Address Social Issues \n1.  Create  Local  Job  Opportunities.  The  implementing  agency  will  require  contractors  to  maximize  hiring  labor  under  the \nProject.  The  Project  will  generate  about  1,300  unskilled  construction  jobs:  80%,  or  1,040  jobs,  will  be  targeted  for  poor \nhouseholds.  In  addition,  a  separate  community-based  local  road  and  maintenance  project  funded  by  the  Japan  Poverty \nReduction Fund will be implemented to generate additional local employment.  \n2.  Improve Medical Facilities and Drinking Water Resources. The Project allocates $150,000 for community development \nactivities in the project area to respond to social needs such as drinking water development, public baths, vocational training, \nand equipment for community-based enterprises.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nMore  than  6,200  people  were  consulted  during  project  preparation  through  public  meetings  and  socioeconomic  surveys. \nVarious stakeholders participated in the consultation process,  such as central  and  local government officials, environmental \nexperts,  social  workers,  teachers,  doctors,  herders,  business  persons,  and  road  users.  Active  participation  from  women  in \npublic meetings was confirmed during the fact-finding mission. These processes have enabled: (i) increased awareness and \nlocal  support,  (ii)  expression  of  opinions  and  concerns  on  social  and  environmental  aspects,  (iii)  relevant  suggestions  for \nwestern  region  and  local  road  designs  (e.g.,  road  alignments  and  access  roads)  and  future  road  projects,  and \n(vi) identification of potential community development projects.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaboration     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nimplement the plan (including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe participatory activities are an ongoing process that will continue during project implementation. \n\n Yes    \n\n No If a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nWomen  in  the  western  aimags  do  not  currently  experience  gender  problems  in  terms  of  women\u2019s  rights  and  access  to \neducation,  health,  and  other  services.  However,  the  country  gender  assessment  identifies  growing  concerns  on  emerging \ngender gaps. Despite women\u2019s higher rate of participation in the workforce and educational attainment, the per capita gross \ndomestic  product  for  women  is  half  of  that  for  men  ($2,730  versus  $1,379)  according  to  2006  Gender  Gaps  Report  by  the \nWorld Economic Forum. A factor is women\u2019s predominant occupation in contracting sectors and men\u2019s dominance in growth \nsectors.  Other  gender  concerns  are  (i)  significantly  higher  incidence  of  poverty  among  households  headed  by  women,  (ii) \nwomen\u2019s unemployment rate is double that of men, and (iii) time poverty caused by increased demand for rural women\u2019s labor \nin food production for household consumption. Also the incidence of domestic violence and alcohol abuse is growing. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote equality between men\u2019s and women\u2019s/girls\u2019 access to and use \nof relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n   Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  all  road  maintenance  training  and  employment  opportunities  will  be  given  and  Mongolian  labor \nstandard  applied  to  anyone  regardless  of  gender.  The  Project  will  incorporate  gender-sensitive  elements  in  prevention \nactivities for sexually transmitted infection and HIV/AIDS.  \n \n\nIII.   \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included \nin Design \n\n \n\n \n\nTo extend positive impacts to \nlocal communities, (i) the Project \nallocates $100,000 for \ncommunity development \nactivities, and (ii) community-\nbased local road upgrading and \nmaintenance is being developed \nunder the proposed Japan \nPoverty Reduction Fund project. \nA specific grant assurance will be \nproposed to ensure local \nemployment under the Project. \n\nAwareness raising and \nmonitoring activities will be \ncarried out by a national expert. \nA specific grant assurance will be \nproposed.  \n\n  Full Plan \n  Short Plan \n  Resettlement \nFramework \n\n  No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  Indigenous \nPeoples \nFramework \n\n  No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action  \n  No Action \n\n  Action \n  No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nIssue \nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nNo impact.

Mongolia is a low HIV/AIDS \nprevalence country, with a \nprevalence rate of less than 0.1, \ni.e., 30 cases officially recorded with \n4 deaths as of 2006. However, \nseveral factors that make Mongolia \nvulnerable: high incidence of \nsexually transmitted infection, which \ncomprise half of all registered \ninfectious disease; prevalence of \nhigh-risk behaviors; increasing \nnumber of sex workers; low condom \nuse rate; and poor access to and \nquality of sexually transmitted \ninfection testing and treatment \nservices. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nIV.  \n\nMONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n57 \n\nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project/program implementation?  \nDuring  construction:  (i)  number  of  locals  employed  by  gender  and  poor  households,  (ii)  implementation  of  HIV/AIDS  and \nsexually  transmitted  infections  and  communicable  disease  program,  and  (iii)  activities  funded  under  the  community \ndevelopment component. \nFollowing  construction:  (i)  regional  gross  domestic  product  and  per  capita  incomes  increased,  (ii)  number  of  poor \nhouseholds reduced, and (iii) traffic along the road increased. \n\n\u25a1   Yes     \u25a1   No      \n\nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 8 January 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\nMNT1.00\n$1.00\n", "togrog (MNT) \n\u2013 \n$0.00085 \n= \n=  MNT1,169.75 \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAH4 \nCAREC \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nGDP \nHIV/AIDS \nICB \nJFPR \nMDG \nMRTT \nNDS \nPRC \nSTI \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Highway 4 \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \ngross domestic product \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  Ministry of Roads, Transport and Tourism \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national development strategy \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nsexually transmitted infection \n", "GLOSSARY \n \nprovince \nlocal administrative subdivision \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "aimag \nsoum \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "C.
