Over 60 \npercent  of  the  population  are  poor.  The  Project  will  provide \nurgently  needed  assistance  in  response  to  the  worsening \nconsequences of drought during the past two years. The Project \nwill complement a wide-ranging package of initiatives under the \nGovernment\u2019s Aral Sea Drought Relief Program being funded by \ninternational development agencies to support the communities in \nthe drought disaster area in western Uzbekistan. The Project will \nsupport  long-term  sustainable  water  supply  management  by \nintroducing water conservation measures, educating the public on \nthe value of water, and promoting health awareness campaigns. \nTo  better  address  the  needs  of  Project  beneficiaries,  a \nparticipatory  approach  will  be  adopted  when  formulating  and \ndesigning  subprojects  under  the  Project.  Thereafter,  the \nbeneficiaries will be involved in implementation.  \n   \nClassification  Poverty: Core poverty intervention  \n \nThematic: Human development \n   \nEnvironmental  Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nAssessment  the summary is a core appendix. The Project will not have any \nadverse  impact  on  the  environment,  but  will  have  a  positive \nimpact by improving the quantity and quality of potable water and \nsanitation facilities.  \n   \nRationale  Karakalpakstan and Khorezm are located in the driest part of \n  Uzbekistan with annual rainfall ranging from 70 to 110 millimeters. \nOver the last three decades, the drying up of the Aral Sea has \naggravated  the  water  shortage  problem.  Since  mid-2000, \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm have been suffering from the worst \ndrought in 100 years. About 90 percent of the rice crop and 75 \npercent of the cotton crop were lost in 2000 and 2001. Many \nfamilies  in  rural  communities  have  lost  direct  access  to  safe \ndrinking water and their main source of income from agriculture. \nWomen and children are often required to fetch water from distant \nalternative  sources.  Drinking  water,  where  available,  is  often \ncontaminated and of poor quality, exposing the population to high \nrisks of waterborne diseases and carcinogenic and immunological \nproblems. The water shortage situation needs to be addressed \nurgently as the condition has deteriorated rapidly since the onset \nof  the  current  drought.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  a ", "   iii\nprogram for short-term humanitarian relief and medium- to long-\nterm  water  resource  management  supported  by  various \nmultilateral and bilateral aid agencies. The Project will provide a \nreliable supply of potable water, alleviate human suffering from \nthe drought, and strengthen the institutional capacity to manage \nscarce water resources in a sustainable manner. The Project will \nallow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to play a key role in the \njoint effort by international aid agencies to assist the Government \nin combating the water shortage and drought problems in the \npoorest  part  of  the  country.  Subregional  water  resource \nmanagement  is  being  addressed  in  parallel  supported  by \ninternational  development  agencies,  including  ADB,  through \nassistance  to  encourage  greater  cooperation  in  transboundary \nwater  use,  more  effective  and  sustainable  subregional  water \nresource management, and encouraging changes in agricultural \npractices. \n   \nObjective and Scope  The main objective of the Project is to improve the living and \n  health conditions in the rural communities in Karakalpalstan and \nKhorezm.  The  Project  will  provide  safe  and  easily  accessible \nwater  supply,  minimize  water  wastage,  and  improve  health \nconditions by supporting the provision of sanitation facilities and \nencouraging better hygiene practices. The Project will mitigate the \nongoing effects of the drought and will strengthen institutional \ncapacity for potable water resource management to ensure the \nGovernment\u2019s  water  supply  program  in  western  Uzbekistan  is \nsustainable.  \n \nThe Project comprises three parts: (i) potable water supply, (ii) \nwater  conservation  and  health  improvement,  and  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding. Potable water supply includes the development of new \nsystems, and rehabilitation and upgrading of existing facilities. \nThe aim is to expand the coverage of potable water supply to \nhouseholds in rural districts from a minimum of 12 percent to 85 \npercent,  reduce  unaccounted  for  water  losses  from  over  50 \npercent to 30 percent, increase supply efficiency of bulk water \nand service delivery, and lower unit costs of production. Water \nconservation and health improvement include introducing water \nconservation measures, improving sanitation facilities in schools \nand clinics, and promoting water- and sanitation-related health \nawareness.  Capacity  building  includes  support  for  project \nmanagement  and  institutional  strengthening  on  water  supply \nmanagement.  \n \nThe main elements (the bulk water supply components) of the \nProject  are  defined  in  detail.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  flexible \napproach  where  community  level  subprojects  will  be  selected, \nplanned,  and  implemented  during  project  implementation  to \nensure assistance is given to areas with the most urgent need \nand to allow for coordination with other aid agencies. The Project \nwill include social measures to identify and mobilize community \n ", "   iv\nparticipation in subproject planning and implementation, monitor \ndemand, and educate on the value of water.   \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $65.0 million equivalent, comprising \n  foreign exchange costs of $37.0 million (56.9 percent) and local \ncurrency costs equivalent to $28.0 million (43.1 percent). \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nSources of Financing  Foreign  Local     \nExchange Currency  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  37.0  1.0  38.0 58.5 \nGovernment of Uzbekistan  0.0  27.0  27.0 41.5 \n       \nTotal  37.0  28.0  65.0 100.0 \n         \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $38.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \n  be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facilities. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, \na  front-end  fee  of  1.0  percent,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2006 \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics (MMS) \n \nImplementation  A  central  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within \nArrangements  MMS.  The  unit  will  be  responsible  for  overall  planning, \n  organization,  and  implementation  of  the  Project,  including \nrecruitment of project management consultants, procurement and \ndisbursement  activities,  implementation  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and reporting to ADB. Project implementation units will \nbe established in Karakalpakstan and in Khorezm for financial \nand project management activities at the local level, including \nselection, design, planning, and implementation of subprojects. A \nproject steering committee chaired by the deputy minister of MMS \nand  comprising  representatives  from  central  and  local \ngovernments has been established to coordinate drought relief \nand water supply activities funded by international aid agencies, \nprovide  policy  guidance,  and  monitor  and  supervise  overall \nproject implementation including the Project. \n   \nProcurement  The procurement of goods and services to be financed by the \n  ADB loan will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. International competitive bidding procedures will \nbe applied for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of \n$500,000 or more, and civil works contracts valued at over $1.0 \nmillion. Supply contracts with a value of $500,000 equivalent or \n ", "   v\nless  will  follow  international  shopping  procedures  except  for \nsupply contracts with a value of  $100,000 equivalent or less, \nwhich may be procured by direct purchase or local competitive \nbidding, as applicable. Civil works contracts valued at $1.0 million \nequivalent  or  less  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive \nbidding. \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 254 person-months of consulting services \n  (32  person-months  of  international  and  222  person-months  of \ndomestic)  for  potable  water  resource  management,  subproject \nselection,  procurement  advice,  financial  management,  detailed \nengineering  design,  project  management,  poverty  reduction, \ncommunity  participation,  and  health  awareness  development. \nConsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants based on the quality and cost-based \nselection method and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe engagement of domestic consultants. \nEstimated Project  30 September 2005 \nCompletion Date \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  700,000  of  the  rural \nBeneficiaries  population  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  who  are  suffering \n  from the lack of safe drinking water that has been worsened by \nthe current drought. The majority of the beneficiaries are poor. An \nincreased  and  more  reliable  supply  of  potable  water  and \nsanitation facilities will improve the health and general welfare of \nthe  beneficiaries,  in  particular  the  vulnerable  groups  who  are \nunable to afford coping mechanisms such as bottled water and \nmust  rely  on  unsafe  water  sources.  By  reducing  leakage  and \nlosses in water supply, existing efficiencies and resulting costs \ncan  be  minimized.  The  participatory  approach  to  selection  of \nsubprojects will enhance ownership among beneficiaries, which in \nturn will improve sustainability of project facilities and generate \nsupport  for  ongoing  operation  and  maintenance  of  equipment, \nand  voluntary  water  conservation  measures  and  health \nawareness. Stability of supply and improved standards of service \nwill increase the willingness to pay for service and will contribute \nto the recovery of operation and maintenance costs in a staged \nmanner, affordable to the population. A stepped tariff structure \nbased on volume of consumption is proposed including a lifeline \ntariff for the low-income group. The proposed tariff charges for \naverage consumption of between 60 and 75 liters per capita per \nday is about 3 to 5 percent of the household income, in line with \nADB\u2019s  affordability  criteria  of  5  percent  of  household  income. \nTariff review will be undertaken annually taking into consideration \noperating costs, design consumption and affordability; the tariff \nwill  be  adjusted  accordingly.  Information,  education,  and \ncommunication campaigns will steer public attitude toward more \nresponsible  water  usage  and  better  sanitation  and  health \npractices.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed \nloan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Western Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply Project. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  During  President  Chino\u2019s  visit  to  Uzbekistan  in  June  2001,  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan  requested  emergency  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nmitigate the impacts of a severe drought that has adversely affected the livelihood of rural \ncommunities in western Uzbekistan for the last two years. The area is adjacent to the Aral Sea \nand covers the Republic of Karakalpakstan (Karakalpakstan) and the province of Khorezm. \nDuring project processing, ADB recognized that while immediate relief was needed for those \nsuffering from the drought, dialogue with the Government on water resource management \nissues was equally important to ensure sustainable development of potable water supply in the \nproject  area.  Accordingly,  a  small-scale  project  preparation  technical  assistance  (TA)  was \napproved  in  January  2002  to  help  the  Government  develop  the  project  proposal.1  Close \nconsultation with the communities and detailed analyses were carried out under the TA. A \nparticipatory approach, involving the communities and local government agencies, was used to \nformulate the Project. This report is based on the findings of the Fact-Finding Mission from 4 to \n25 February 20022 and earlier ADB missions, and has incorporated feedback from consultations \nwith project beneficiaries; reports prepared by the TA consultants; and discussions with the \ncentral  and  local  governments,  international  assistance  agencies,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Sector Description \n \n1.  Water Resources in Western Uzbekistan \n \n3.  In 1960 the Aral Sea was the fourth largest inland lake in the world. Increasing use of the \nmain contributory rivers of Amudarya and Syrdarya for water intensive agriculture, particularly \ncotton and rice growing, has resulted in greatly reduced volumes of water entering the Aral Sea. \nAs a result, the sea has shrunk to less than half its original size and only 20 percent of its \noriginal volume. The desiccation of the Aral Sea has resulted in the loss of its fishing, tourism, \nand shipping industries, and the destruction of the ecosystem of the sea and deltas. The salty \ndesert that has now been formed results in up to 100 million tons of windblown salt dust \ncontaminating  the  surrounding  regions  in  Uzbekistan  and  Kazakhstan,  further  inhibiting \nagricultural  production.  From  the  mid-1990s,  a  decline  in  snow  and  glacier  melt  from  the \nsurrounding mountains combined with a reduction in rainfall have significantly reduced the \nnatural resources of water within the two major watersheds. The Amudarya River in particular \nhas been the main source of fluvial and shallow aquifer abstraction for human consumption and \n                                                 \n1  TA 3828-UZB: Aral Sea Area Drought Relief Project, for $150,000, approved on 3 January 2002. \n2  The Mission comprised A. Leung, Urban Development Specialist and Mission Leader; L. Nazarbekova, Counsel; \nM. Perlas, Senior Portfolio Management Specialist, Uzbekistan Resident Mission (URM); R. Abdukayumov, \nPortfolio  Management  Officer  (URM);  J.  Leleu,  Water  Supply  Engineer  (TA  consultant);  L.  Thorn,  Social \nDevelopment Specialist (TA consultant); and T. Villareal, Economic and Financial Analyst (TA consultant). As all \nissues were resolved during the Mission, Management approved waiving the appraisal mission under the New \nBusiness Processes. ", "  2   \nagricultural use in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, and the reduced volume of flow has resulted in \nthe present drought conditions.   \n \n4.  The  annual  flow  of  the  Amudarya  River  at  Tuyamuyun,  a  complex  of  lakes  and \nreservoirs located approximately 400 kilometers (km) upstream of the Aral Sea and where the \nAmudarya River flows from Turkmenistan into Uzbekistan, was around 40,000 million cubic \nmeters (m3) between 1991 and 1999. In 2000, the flow at Tuyamuyun reduced to an annual \naverage of 20,180 million m3 and this dropped to 14,400 million m3 in 2001. In each of these \nyears, the river has run dry before it reached the Aral Sea. Impounding reservoirs constructed \non the Amudarya River at Tuyamuyun enable the diversion of flows into primary irrigation canals \nfrom  which  water  is  fed  by  gravity  to  the  entire  irrigation  network  in  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm. The raw water supply for Nukus, the capital city, and other towns and villages in \nKarakalpakstan, and for Urgench, the capital city, and the towns and settlements in Khorezm, \nare extracted from such canals. The drought conditions have resulted in insufficient water to \nproperly supply these canals, with the consequences of very limited available water or water \nbelow the level of gravity supply, thus requiring pumping and incurring associated overhead \ncosts.  \n \n5.  Another source of water supply is groundwater found in aquifers at varying depths, \nalthough  the  quality  of  such  water  varies  considerably  and  is  mostly  nonpotable  due  to \ncontamination from leached salts and agricultural chemicals. Deep groundwater is the main \nalternative and sustainable source. It is located between 400 and 900 meters below ground and \nis unaffected by surface activities such as pollutant discharges. However, deep groundwater is \nextremely high in mineral salts and requires desalination prior to human consumption. \n \n6.  The formal supply of potable water throughout Karakalpakstan and Khorezm is from a \ncombination of wells, boreholes, and, increasingly, by bulk water transmission from both the \nAmudarya River and the Tuyamuyon complex. These sources provide water to approximately \n71 percent of the population in Karakalpakstan and 64 percent in Khorezm. The bulk water \nabstraction scheme comprises pumping from the Karapas reservoir in the Tuyamuyon lake \ncomplex and from the main stream reservoir of the Amudarya River. The abstracted water, \namounting to about 470,000 m3/day, is then treated and transmitted to Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm.  Water  abstracted  from  the  Amudarya  River  at  Tuyamuyun  and  downstream  for \npotable use represents only 5 percent of the total annual flow, the remainder is used for \nirrigation. Water distribution centers (WDCs) receive bulk water from the transmission mains. \nAfter storage and further disinfection, the water is pumped into the distribution networks. In \nareas where WDCs are not supplied by trunk mains, water is obtained from boreholes and deep \nwells, and is desalinated and disinfected before being pumped for distribution. Distribution is \nmainly by pipe systems but also by tankers where settlement is remote. Other means of \nsupplying water to the rural population are shallow open wells and hand pumps, but in these \nlatter cases, water quality does not meet national or international standards. \n \n2.  Impact of the Drought \n \n7.  The drought has resulted in severely worsening water resources in the project area. In \n2000, water flow to this area was about 40 percent of the long-term annual average. This has \nworsened in 2001 with estimated water resources (including both potable and nonpotable) in \nKarakalpakstan at only 70 percent of the 2000 level and 30 percent of the 1999 level. Inefficient \nwater management practices and lack of water conservation awareness exacerbate the already \ndifficult situation. In 2000, about 90 percent of the rice crop and about 75 percent of the cotton \ncrop were lost. Similar losses are anticipated in 2001, including significant losses in the wheat ", "  3   \nharvest. In 2001, due to the continued water shortage, the Government had to reduce the \noverall cropping area, mainly among the rice-growing areas, because of its water intensive \nrequirements. Initiatives by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization are currently \nongoing to pilot alternative agricultural cropping that is less water intensive. However, until \nresults are available and farming practices change, the current socioeconomic depression will \ncontinue.3  \n \n8.  The drought and drying up of substantial parts of the Amudarya River and its canal \nnetwork not only obviates direct availability of water from these sources, but also severely \nrestricts  the  supply  from  shallow  wells  and  medium-depth  ground  lenses  that  rely  on \ngroundwater recharge through seasonal rainfall and seepage from the river and canals. Shallow \nwells are generally located near the river and irrigation canals, and the reduction or cessation of \nflow into the canals results in falling groundwater levels and the consequential abandonment or \nneed to deepen wells. This is especially true of the prevailing conditions in Karakalpakstan. \nWhile all canals remain operational, the flow has dwindled from 50 m3/second to a mere 2 \nm3/second. The secondary and tertiary canal systems are even more inefficient and the overall \nirrigation efficiency reaches only between 20 and 40 percent. Much of the already reduced \nvolume of water for irrigation is therefore lost, and with it access to water for personal, livestock, \nand agricultural use. Local sources of drinking water, where available, are often contaminated \nand of poor quality leading to a high incidence of waterborne diseases in the area. \n \n3.  Subregional Cooperation on Water Resource Management \n \n9.  The drying of the Aral Sea has resulted in severe and wide-ranging impacts on the \nenvironment, economy, and human population. In the late 1980s, programs were initiated by the \nformer Soviet Union to deal with the key problems in the Aral Sea region. Since independence \nin 1991, these efforts were carried out by the five nations in the Aral Sea basin\uf8e7Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan\uf8e7with  major  help  from  the \ninternational community, primarily the World Bank, the United States, and the European Union. \nThe five nations signed a water-sharing measure in 1991 that included a provision to provide at \nleast 14,000 million m3 of water per year to the Aral Sea. In practice, however, this water has \nbeen  supplied  to  gauging  points  in  the  deltas  of  the  Amudarya  and  Syrdarya  rivers,  and \ndeliveries to the sea have been considerably smaller. In 1998, the World Bank approved a grant \nunder the Global Environmental Facility to assist the Aral Sea Basin Program of the five Central \nAsian republics to address the root causes of the overuse and degradation of the Aral Sea \nBasin waters.4 The objectives of this assistance are to help the governments (i) create a \ncommon  policy,  strategy,  and  action  programs  for  national  and  regional  water  and  salt \nmanagement; (ii) change cropping patterns to reduce irrigation; (iii) promote water conservation; \n(iv) improve transboundary water quantity and quality; and (v) restore a wetland for biodiversity \nconservation. Implementation of this project is ongoing and is progressing well. \n \n4.  Government Institutions for Water Supply \n \n10.  Administration of the country\u2019s water resources and potable water supply is shared by \nvarious agencies under the overall supervision of the Cabinet of Ministers. Raw water resources \nfrom the Amudarya River and at the Tuyamuyon complex are the responsibility of the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Water Resources. The raw water abstraction facilities and transmission network \n                                                 \n3  From a mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization to identify agricultural interventions in drought affected \nareas of Uzbekistan, carried out in January, 2002. \n4 The Global Environmental Facility $12.2 million grant for the Aral Sea Basin Program/Water and Environmental \nManagement Project is administered by the World Bank. ", "  4   \nis under the overall responsibility of the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA). Two \nUCSA departments, one each in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, are responsible for operating \nabstraction pumping stations, treatment works, and transmission pipelines in the two regions.  \n \n11.  In Khorezm, water from the transmission mains is supplied to both the vodokanals \n(urban water and sewerage agencies) and the agrovodokanals (rural water and sewerage \nagencies). Both vodokanals and agrovodokanals are under the supervision of the Territorial \nCommunal Services Agency (TCSA), which reports to the provincial governor. The TCSA is also \nresponsible for the province\u2019s sanitation, central heating, and solid waste systems, among other \nresponsibilities relating to public services. However, sanitation service to the rural communities \nis  minimal  with  only  occasional  solid  waste  collection.  In  Karakalpakstan,  water  from  the \ntransmission mains is supplied to the vodokanals, which report to the TCSA in Karakalpakstan. \nWater from the transmission mains is also supplied to agrovodokanals, which report directly to \nthe Council of Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. \n \n12.  The agrovodokanals in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm are responsible for the operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of rural water supply systems, yet a serious deficiency exists in their \nfunctional ability to efficiently manage their assets and deliver services to consumers. Financial \nmanagement is weak and not based on commercial principles. While tariffs are in place, they \nare low and not able to cover the full cost of service provisions. The problems are due to (i) the \nagrovodokanals being transferred out from the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources \nwithout the benefits of adequate technical support or operational equipment; (ii) inability to \nmanage their assets in a structured and efficient manner; (iii) lack of experience in modern \nwater supply practice and techniques; and (iv) lack of experience in working in partnership with \nconsumer groups and NGOs. The institutional capacity of the agrovodokanals and their staff \nneeds to be strengthened through structured training.  \n \n13.  Water quality standards are monitored by the State Epidemiological Survey, which is \npart of the Ministry of Health and maintains operational units in each province or region. These \nunits  have  the  responsibility  to  monitor  the  quality  standards  of  potable  water  supply  or \nwastewater  discharge,  and  can  levy  penalties  for  noncompliance  by  the  vodokanals  or \nagrovodokanals. \n \n14.  At the central level, coordination of the activities of UCSA, the Karakalpakstan Council of \nMinisters,  and  the  Khorezm  provincial  government  is  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of \nMacroeconomics  and  Statistics  (MMS).  MMS\u2019s  Department  for  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment is tasked to (i) develop plans for improving rural water and gas supply systems \njointly  with  UCSA,  the  Karakalpakstan  Council  of  Ministers,  and  the  Khorezm  provincial \ngovernment; (ii) define cost-sharing arrangements between the central and local governments \nfor financing projects jointly with the Ministry of Finance and the above-mentioned three bodies; \nand (iii) monitor the implementation of the these activities. In addition, MMS coordinates the \nimplementation of an ongoing World Bank water supply, sanitation, and health project,5 as well \nas  other  aid-funded  projects  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  Appendix  2  shows  the \norganization structure for potable water supply in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  The total project cost is $120 million of which the World Bank loan is $75 million with cofinancing from Kuwait Fund \n($20 million) and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany ($10 million). ", "  5   \n5.  Socioeconomic Issues in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm \n \na.  Potable Water Supply   \n \n15.  Lack of access to potable water is a major reason why socioeconomic development in \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm lags behind that of Uzbekistan in general. As of 1 January 2001, \nthe potable water supply coverage for the rural population of Uzbekistan was 72.3 percent \ncompared with 41.6 percent for Karakalpakstan and 55.5 percent for Khorezm. However, these \nlatter two figures reflect coverage in terms of water supply facilities, not actual availability of \nwater for the population. The drought and water shortages have rendered part of those facilities \nnonfunctional.6 Furthermore, the drought, water shortage in the Amudarya River, and rapidly \nfalling water tables have caused many shallow wells and irrigation canals to dry up. Since about \n51 percent of all households, comprising close to 100,000 households and about 560,000 \nindividuals, in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm rely on either open wells or shallow boreholes, this \nrestricted or lost access to water is catastrophic. Even before this loss of supply, the water \nsources contained a salinity level that was nearly double the maximum allowable concentration \nrecommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization.7  The  water  shortage  has  resulted  in \ndegradation  of  the  environment  and  deterioration  of  the  living  conditions  of  the  people. \nTherefore, alternative and sustainable resources for potable supplies are urgently needed. \n \nb.  Health, Hygiene, and Sanitation \n \n16.  The lack and poor quality of potable water have posed serious health risks to the \npopulation  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  over  the  decades,  especially  for  women  and \nchildren. These are caused mainly by drinking water contaminated with salt and fecal matter, \nheavy mineral content, pesticides, and fertilizers. According to the State Epidemiological Survey \n(para. 13), 34.4 percent of samples taken from all surface waters in Khorezm in 2000 did not \nmeet the state standards for microbiological safety and 15 percent exhibited positive cholera-\nlike vibrios. Rural sanitary facilities comprise largely simple, open pit latrines. Unsanitary and \nbadly maintained pit latrines without the benefit of water for even basic hand washing, a general \nlack of satisfactory personal hygiene practices, and the severely restricted availability of water \nrenders  the  population,  particularly  school  children,  at  serious  risk  to  infections.  Hygiene \nawareness is low or nonexistent in many rural communities. \n \n17.  According  to  a  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  report  (footnote  7),  the \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm areas are characterized by the highest rate of infant mortality \n(about 52 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality (about 100 per 100,000 live births) in \nCentral Asia. Typical health problems in Karakalpakstan are diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis \nA, allergies, and illnesses related to neurological, carcinogenic, immunological, and reproductive \nfunctions.8 Liver cancer has increased five-fold in the last decade. Birth defects are five times \nhigher than in Europe, 90 percent of pregnancies have complications, and about 30 percent of \npregnant women have kidney diseases. About 30\u201380 percent of children under 3 years and 50\u2013\n80 percent of women in the fertile age group suffer from anemia; the tuberculosis incidence at \n150\u2013250 per 100,000 population is among the highest in Central Asia. Children suffering from \nmalnutrition and other diseases have problems concentrating and learning. As a result of the \n                                                 \n6  For example, in the district of Koshkupir in Khorezm, 27 percent of rural households have access to a piped water \nsupply, although in practice only 12 percent benefit from a system that is operational. \n7  UNICEF. 2001. Chronic Water Shortage Affecting Children in Uzbekistan, Proposed June 2001-May 2002, UNICEF \nArea Office for Central Asia Republics and Kazakhstan. Tashkent. \n8  In 2000, diarrhea cases rose dramatically with an increase of 36 percent in June alone. An 80 percent increase in \nhepatitis A was recorded during the first six months. ", "  6   \ndrought, children, especially girls, who normally help with household chores, have the added \ntask of collecting water from more distant sources. These problems have contributed to reduced \nattendance  at  school  and  a  higher  educational  dropout  rate,  seriously  impairing  children\u2019s \nprospects for future learning.  \n \nc.  Agriculture and Unemployment  \n \n18.  The  main  economic  activities  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  are  agriculture  and \nagroprocessing. Agriculture alone accounts for about 30 percent of Karakalpakstan\u2019s gross \ndomestic product and about 40 percent of Khorezm\u2019s gross domestic product. Crop production \nin both areas is almost totally irrigation dependent. Sail salinity is medium to high in 28 percent \nof the irrigated land. About 20 percent of irrigated land has such high salt and mineral content \nthat it requires annual leaching by using high amounts of fresh river water\u2014a practice that leads \nto increased water consumption for irrigation. Productivity of irrigated land in Karakalpakstan is \n4.5 times lower than the national average, and in Khorezm 1.4 times. As a consequence of the \nwater shortage problem, an estimated 15\u201320 percent of potential agricultural productivity is lost \nannually. During 2000, losses in agricultural production in Karakalpakstan alone were estimated \nat about SUM15 billion ($21.6 million equivalent).9 Other effects include increases in food prices \nand depletion of family food reserves for the winter. Due to the shortage of irrigation water that \nis exacerbated by the drought, crop seeding was halved in 2001 and an estimated additional \n100,000  people  (79,000  in  Karakalpakstan  and  21,000  in  Khorezm)  became  temporarily \nunemployed.10  The  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  reported  that  the  registered \nunemployed rose by about 13 percent in Karakalpakstan and 41 percent in  Khorezm, between \nthe first quarters of 2000 and 2001. According to MMS, unemployment in Karakalpakstan was \n82.2 percent and in Khorezm 66.8 percent in 2001. The majority of the unemployed were in the \nagriculture sector. \n \nd.  Poverty  \n \n19.  The Government does not have a generally agreed or reliable measure of poverty or an \nofficial poverty line. The poor are classified based on the prevailing minimum wage adjusted for \ninflation, and instead of the term \u201cpoverty,\u201d living standards are used in official documents.11 \nADB is currently implementing TA to help the Government develop a medium-term strategy for \nimproving living standards.12 Recent work by the World Bank, the European Union\u2019s Technical \nAssistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation) using the minimum \nwage criteria showed that urban poverty in Karakalpakstan was about 50 percent compared \nwith 10 percent in Tashkent (national capital) and 28 percent in Ferghana province. Due to the \nhigher percentage of rural population and the impact of agricultural losses, rural poverty is \nhigher. The poor comprise mostly the unemployed, the marginally self-employed, and those \nemployed  in  agriculture  and  low-paid  public  sector  jobs.  The  drought  conditions  in \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  have  inevitably  increased  the  number  of  those  living  below \nsubsistence levels in the two areas. \n \n                                                 \n9   Mitigation of Drought Consequences in the Aral Sea Area, a proposal submitted in mid-2000 by the MMS to the \ninternational community in Tashkent. \n10 Report by the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, United Nations Development \nProgramme, and WHO, July 2001. \n11  The official minimum wage in August 2001 was set at SUM3,430 (about $5) per month. \n12 TA 3781-UZB: Comprehensive Medium-Term Strategy for Improving the Living Standards of the People of \nUzbekistan, for $800,000, approved on 28 November 2001. ", "  7   \n6.  Community-Based and Nongovernment Organizations  \n \n20.  NGOs are more active in Karakalpakstan than in Khorezm. Approximately 160 NGOs \nare registered in Karakalpakstan with activities focusing on water and ecological issues, and on \npublic  health  awareness.  Only  about  40  are  registered  in  Khorezm.  Community-based \norganizations (CBOs) are also well developed and comprise local rural assemblies. These rural \nassemblies are legal entities headed by respected local elders, most of whom are male. Each \nrural assembly is in charge of a number of mahallas, which is a traditional cultural form of \ngovernment in Uzbekistan for administering social assistance on behalf of the state. The rural \nassemblies are responsible for community affairs including enforcing laws, implementing local \nlegislation, ensuring timely payment of taxes and charges for communal services, and allocating \nsocial  benefits.  Women\u2019s  committees  exist  in  both  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  These \ngovernment-recognized groups are responsible for women\u2019s affairs in the community and have \nthe potential to assist with community projects. \n \nB.  Government Policies and Plans \n \n21.  Since independence, the Government has adopted a policy of developing stable and \nflexible water supply, strengthening the water supply agencies involved, and developing and \nimplementing water conservation programs. Special emphasis has been given to rural water \nsupply that historically was lagging behind the pace of development of urban water supply. The \nGovernment passed two resolutions, one in 1996 and the other in 1998, mandating programs to \nconstruct 9,500 km of piped networks in rural areas and 750 km in urban areas during 1996\u2013\n2000. Included were 2,030 km of rural piped networks and 80 km of urban piped networks for \nKarakalpakstan, and 960 km and 75 km, respectively, for Khorezm.13 The completion of this \nwork, which was funded domestically, achieved coverage of about 80 percent of the urban \npopulation  and  46.1  percent  of  the  rural  population  in  Karakalpakstan.  The  corresponding \nfigures for Khorezm were 91 percent and 55.5 percent. However, as mentioned in para. 15, \nactual availability of water for the rural population remains a serious problem.  \n \n22.  Another Government resolution in June 1999 mandates the scope of development of the \ncountry\u2019s rural water supply until 2010.14 In preparing the resolution, a detailed inventory was \nmade  of  all  rural  settlements  in  the  country  and  identified  unserved  settlements.  For \nKarakalpakstan,  the  target  is  to  provide  water  to  784  additional  rural  settlements,  thereby \nreaching coverage of 94.1 percent of the population by 2010. For Khorezm, the target is to \nprovide 144 additional rural settlements with water supply to reach a coverage level of 94.4 \npercent of the population by 2010. The Government recognizes that the drought and water \nmanagement problems need to be addressed through a practical and sustainable strategy that \ncomprises short-, medium-, and long-term measures. The 10-year Aral Sea Drought Relief \nProgram for Karakalpakstan and Khorezm was formulated in 2000. Besides improving the \nquantity and quality of potable water supply, the program includes health care, microcredit-\nbased employment generation, social protection of vulnerable families especially in the fall-\nwinter season, and irrigation and drainage. Long-term measures include incentives for water \nconservation and changes in crop patterns, improvement of the financial and technical capacity \nof the water utilities to operate and manage the facilities, introduction of cost-based tariffs, and \ndevelopment of small and medium enterprises to reduce reliance on agriculture. MMS oversees \n                                                 \n13 Cabinet of Ministers, Resolution No. 182, On the Program for Development of Rural Social Infrastructure in the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan until 2000, passed on 26 May 1996; and Resolution No. 117, On the Program for Supply of \nPotable Water and Natural Gas to the Rural Population for 1998-2000, passed on 17 March 1998. \n14 Cabinet of Ministers, Resolution No. 278, On Measures for Further Improving Supply of Potable Water and Natural \nGas to the Rural Settlements, passed on 1 June 1999. ", "  8   \nthe program, which has a fairly complex, multicomponent approach. Implementation of the \nprogram involves various ministries such as health, and agriculture, and water resources. The \nprogram is estimated at about $550 million and external assistance is required to meet the \nfunding requirement. \n \n23.  The Government\u2019s short-term program for potable water supply to provide immediate \nrelief to the drought-affected population in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm include (i) focus on \nrural areas where piped or subsurface water is unavailable; (ii) access to drinking water for \nchildren and sick people through services to schools and hospitals; (iii) installation of hand \npumps in areas where there is no piped water supply and where groundwater can be extracted \nby hand pumps; (iv) rehabilitation or replacement of water treatment plants; and (v) use of \ntanker trucks to transport water to population groups that do not have any of the above-\nmentioned water sources. The Government issued a decree in June 2001 to implement the \nprogram.15 The decree included social measures to address the deteriorating situation as a \nresult of the drought. These include assistance to vulnerable groups, exemption of certain taxes, \nand provision of credits for cattle. The Government has also agreed to write off debts of farmers \nin Karakalpakstan and Khorezm to the total value of SUM12.9 billion ($18.6 million equivalent). \n \nC.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n24.  External assistance to the water supply sector in Uzbekistan is increasing although \nlargely focused in urban areas. This includes an ongoing World Bank water supply, sanitation, \nand health project in the cities of Nukus and Urgench in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, and a \nproject recently approved by the World Bank for water supply in the cities of Bukhara and \nSamarkand. Bilateral assistance includes a number of projects under preparation. The French \ngovernment is proposing assistance for water supply and sanitation in the cities of Namangan \nand  Samarkand,  and  has  expressed  strong  interest  in  providing  financial  support  for  the \nproposed  Project.  The  Spanish  government  is  considering  assistance  for  water  supply  in \nBukhara. Assistance to cross-border cooperation on water and energy issues is being provided \nby the World Bank (para. 9) and by the United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID) under its Environmental Policies and Institutions for Central Asia initiative. Phase II of \nthis initiative addressed institutional development of Aral Sea Basin water management and the \nforthcoming Phase III will improve water and energy management. \n \n25.  ADB  recently  approved  a  loan  to  finance  an  urban  water  supply  project  for  three \nprovincial cities16 and a grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to support \ninnovative poverty reduction initiatives in Karakalpakstan.17 A loan and two TAs are included in \nthe 2002\u20132004 country program to assist the Government with water resource management for \nagriculture and capacity building of water supply agencies.18 On subregional water resource \nmanagement, ADB is currently implementing a TA on regional cooperation on shared water \nresources that includes the Central Asian republics19 and is working on a water energy nexus \n                                                 \n15 Government Resolution No. 249, On Additional Measures for Social Protection of the Population and Mitigation of \nConsequences of Water Shortage in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Province, passed on 8 June \n2001. \n16 Loan 1842-UZB: Urban Water Supply Project, for $36.0 million, approved on 27 September 2001. \n17 JPFR 9010-UZB: Supporting Innovative Poverty Reduction in Karakalpalstan, for $2.54 million, approved on 25   \nOctober 2001. The project includes the provision of hand pumps to villages. \n18 Loan: Water Resources Management for Agriculture to be processed in 2003; project preparatory TA: Improvement \nof Water Resources Management for Agriculture ($600,000) and advisory TA: Capacity Building for Water Supply \nAgencies ($600,000) to be processed in 2002. \n19 TA 6001-REG: Regional Consultation for the Third World Water Forum, for $1,000,000, approved on 9 October \n2001. ", "  9   \nstudy jointly with USAID to develop a strategy for supporting transboundary water resource \nmanagement. A study to explore hydropower development in Central Asia is ongoing. Based on \nthe findings of these studies, ADB will formulate a medium-term strategy on regional water \nissues, in connection with support to the energy sector.   \n \n26.  In recent years, multilateral and bilateral aid agencies have been actively assisting the \nGovernment with its social programs to address the urgent needs of the affected population in \nwestern Uzbekistan and to manage the ecological and socioeconomic catastrophe. The World \nBank  through  its  ongoing  project  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm;  the  Kuwait  Fund  for \nEconomic  Development;  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of  Germany;  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme;  and  the  governments  of  France,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea, \nSwitzerland,  and  the  United  States  are  among  those  providing  significant  assistance.  The \nGovernment is currently negotiating with USAID to support a water supply project in a district in \nnorth Karakalpakstan. Appendix 3 provides a summary of the initiatives by multilateral and \nbilateral funding agencies to assist the Government\u2019s water supply program in response to the \ndrought. \n \n27.  The  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  support  the  initiatives  under  the  JFPR  grant \n(footnote 17) and was prepared in close coordination with major international aid agencies. \nCoordination has led to joint approaches on strategies to assist the Government in developing \nand implementing long-term sustainable potable water resource management on the one hand \nand mitigating the effect of the ongoing drought on the other. The Project will allow ADB to play \na key role in the international effort to provide relief to the drought-affected population and to \ncontribute to longer-term solutions to potable water supply in the project area. The Project will \nfocus on rural potable water supply and improvement to public sanitation and health awareness, \nall of which are urgently needed but where funding is very limited. \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n \n28.  As implementation of ADB\u2019s urban water supply project in Uzbekistan (footnote 16) has \nnot yet begun, experience from implementing water supply projects financed by other external \nfunding agencies and ADB\u2019s portfolio in other social sectors were considered when designing \nthe  Project.  Several  lessons  have  been  learned.  On  the  preparation  of  projects,  overall \nprocessing has been protracted because of difficulties encountered during policy dialogue with \nthe Government. The project development process is often delayed due to a prolonged process \nfor releasing information. Stakeholder consultation and participation is required when preparing \nprojects in accordance with the needs of the Government and beneficiaries to ensure ownership \nand commitment. The Government recognizes the need to focus on sustainability of operations \nand increasing ownership by beneficiaries. \n \n29.  The lessons from ADB water supply sector projects in other countries, in particular those \nin  Central  Asia,  have  also  been  studied.  In  general,  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  limited \nexperience with project implementation has led to delays and slow disbursement. Another \nproblem  is  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  local  governments,  thus  requiring  substantial \ntechnical and financial assistance. These issues were discussed with the Government during \nproject  formulation  and  appropriate  measures  including  project  management  support  and \ntraining programs on implementation procedures have been comprehensively incorporated in \nthe project design. \n \n30.  Taking  into  account  these  experiences,  the  Project  has  incorporated  the  following \nfeatures in its design: (i) a flexible menu of subprojects will be adopted that include both ", "  10   \nstrategic and locally focused works that can be completed within the required time frame and \nwithin the capability of the local agencies to construct, operate, and maintain; (ii) stakeholders \nsuch as rural assemblies, women\u2019s committees, or similar community organizations will be \ninvolved in developing subprojects, and may, where appropriate, be responsible for O&M of the \nfacilities; (iii) information, education, and communication campaigns will be carried out; (iv) \nproject activities will be coordinated with the central and local governments and international \nfunding agencies; and (v) training will be provided to strengthen the necessary institutional \nprocedures and to ensure efficient and expeditious procurement. \n \nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy  \n \n31.  The central goal of ADB\u2019s strategy in Uzbekistan is to help manage the transition to a \nmarket-based economy, and support sustainable poverty reduction and improved standards of \nliving. In support of this goal, ADB\u2019s operational objectives focus on (i) managing the transition, \nincluding  supporting  basic  reforms  and  minimizing  the  social  costs  of  transition;  and  (ii) \nenhancing the potential for growth through regional cooperation, investment in the rural sector, \nand direct support to the private sector. Within this framework, ADB\u2019s operational strategies \nreinforce the thrust of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and the Government\u2019s commitment to \nimproving the living standards of the vulnerable, low-income, and socially excluded segments of \nits society. The 2001 country strategy and program update emphasizes ADB\u2019s assistance in \nagriculture and rural development as most of the country\u2019s poor reside in rural areas. As \nmentioned  earlier,  ADB  has  provided  grant  assistance  for  supporting  poverty  reduction  in \nKarakalpakstan (footnote 17) and is assisting the Government to prepare a strategy to improve \nthe living standards in the country (footnote 12). \n \n32.  The  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  support  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  by \naddressing the worsening conditions to which the populations of Karakalpalstan and Khorezm \nare subjected. The target groups to be served by the Project are largely poor households in \nrural and remote areas where primary basic needs, such as potable water supply, are lacking. \n \nF.  Policy Dialogue \n \n1.  Sustainable Water Resource Management \n \n33.  The challenges of water resource management in the Aral Sea area are a legacy of the \nformer  Soviet  Union.  The  main  cause  of  the  water  scarcity  in  the  area  is  the  prolonged \ninequitable and inefficient management of water resources in the transboundary Amudarya \nRiver Basin, both within Uzbekistan, and between the riparian countries. The Government is \nnow faced with a dilemma on how to strike a balance between adopting stringent measures to \narrest  the  worsening  environmental  degradation,  and  protecting  the  livelihood  and \nsocioeconomic  welfare  of  a  population  that  is  heavily  dependent  on  agriculture.  The \nGovernment  has  actively  participated  in  the  subregional  cooperation  on  water  resource \nmanagement and in the development of national and regional sustainable water management \npolicies and strategies (para. 9 and footnote 4). Through policy dialogue, the Government \nrecognizes the need for a sustainable approach to water resource management in western \nUzbekistan  and  the  necessity  to  complete  the  development  of  its  long-term  strategy  for \nsocioeconomic development in the area. The latter is also supported by other multilateral and \nbilateral assistance agencies, and a roundtable meeting was held in October 2001 to discuss ", "  11   \nhow the international community can assist.20 In line with the framework  discussed at the \nOctober  meeting,  the  Government  agreed  that  the  proposed  Project  should  achieve  two \ncomplementary objectives. The first is to assist the Government in developing its potable water \nresource management strategy through institutional strengthening and training of concerned \nstaff. The second is to mitigate the ongoing effects of the drought in western Uzbekistan by \nimproving potable water supply. ADB has committed further assistance to the Government in \ntransboundary water management, water resource management for agriculture, and capacity \nbuilding for water supply agencies (para. 25, footnotes 18 and 19).  \n \n2.  Investment Priorities and Poverty Focus \n \n34.  While the Government does not currently have an explicit poverty reduction strategy \n(para. 19), it has invested major efforts to maintain the provision of social services such as \nhealth, education, and basic communal services and social protection for vulnerable groups as \nintegral  components  of  its  reform  process  to  a  market  economy.  Basic  infrastructure \ninvestments have traditionally been planned and financed by the central Government and large \nprojects tend to be focused in the urban areas. The Government realizes that the need to \nimprove basic water supply is urgent, and thus improve the health and living conditions of the \nrural  residents  in  western  Uzbekistan  who  have  long  been  suffering  from  water  shortage \nproblems intensified by the current drought. The Government agreed that the Project should \nrehabilitate and expand existing water supply facilities, develop new water supply, and introduce \nwater conservation and health improvement measures to selected poor rural areas. While \nminimizing costs, the emphasis will be on rehabilitating and upgrading existing facilities, and \nusing simple technology and low-cost methods. The poverty focus is reflected in the selection of \nsubprojects where priority will be given to poor communities that have a majority of their \npopulation living below the minimum wage criteria and with high incidences of malnutrition and \nwaterborne diseases. Over 60 percent of the households in the targeted project communities \nare earning less than the minimum wage, and limited access to potable water supply and \nsanitation is a major issue contributing to poverty. \n \n3.  Decentralization of Implementation and Stakeholder Participation \n \n35.  Current Government policies, decrees, and resolutions reflect significant commitment to \nimplementing institutional and financial reforms in the water supply sector. However, top-down \napproaches  are  still  embedded  at  all  administrative  levels  of  government.  In  particular, \nparticipation  of  local  communities  is  limited.  The  Project  addresses  decentralization  and \ngovernance issues by strengthening the institutional capacity of local governments to carry out \nthe decentralized functions of providing and maintaining local water supply services. As a result \nof ADB policy dialogue with the central and local governments, the Project will be implemented \nby local governments and managed by the central Government in support of the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization policy. Experience indicates that beneficiary participation, good governance, \nand project sustainability are interrelated factors that contribute to project success, and need to \nbe factored into project design and implementation arrangements. The Project is structured to \nincrease local responsibility for water supply services by decentralizing implementation and \nO&M, and actively involving both government and community-based stakeholders. Through the \nparticipatory process supported by information and education campaigns, consumers will be \neducated on the need to conserve and price water as an economic resource. The Government \nalso supports the need for capacity building measures, including training of local staff and \n                                                 \n20  The  roundtable  was  held  on  3  October  2001  in  Nukus,  capital  of  Karakalpakstan.  Participants  included \nrepresentatives from, among others, ADB, the World Bank, United Nation Development Programme, UNICEF, \nUSAID, and various embassies including Japan, Germany, and the United States. ", "  12   \nsupport for the NGO and CBO implementation role in communities to achieve sustainable \ndelivery of services that meet the needs of the population. \n \n4.  Cost Recovery  \n \n36.  Under the reform policy, the Government seeks to establish self-financing principles for \nthe provision of urban and rural infrastructure services. Resolution No. 243 requires full recovery \nof O&M costs and permits charging a higher tariff to cover part of the capital cost.21 The \nGovernment considers that the pricing of basic infrastructure services should balance four main \nobjectives:  (i)  cost  recovery  to  ensure  financial  viability  and  sustainability;  (ii)  affordability, \nparticularly for lower income customers; (iii) demand management through metered charging; \nand (iv) economic efficiency. This policy will be implemented over a number of years. However, \nthe Government recognizes that it will be difficult to achieve full cost recovery for services to \nrural  communities  suffering  from  economic  hardship  as  a  consequence  of  the  drought. \nCurrently, the agrovodokanals in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm receive Government subsidies \nfor both capital and operating requirements. After careful analysis of the economic situation in \nthe project area, the Government agrees to (i) target full O&M cost recovery in the long term; (ii) \ncontinue subsidies in the short term if affordability criteria cannot be met; (iii) use stepped tariffs \nfor water, with a lifeline tariff for the lowest income group as a way forward; and (iv) review \ntariffs  annually  and  adjust  them  accordingly  taking  into  account  collection  efficiency  rates, \nexpenditure, and future investment plans. The Government also confirms that it will continue the \npolicy of subsidizing rural water supply in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm to ensure sustainable \nservice provision to the rural population. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n37.  Western Uzbekistan, comprising Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, has been suffering from \nwater shortage for the past three decades. The situation has deteriorated rapidly since the onset \nof the worst drought and water shortage in 100 years that started in the mid-1990s. Due to the \nshortage of irrigation water from the Amudarya River, most of the rice, cotton, and wheat crops \nwere lost in 2000 and 2001. Similar outcomes are expected in 2002. Because irrigation canals, \nwhich used to be a main source of raw water for household use, are now either dried up or \ndrying up, many rural households have lost direct access to safe drinking water, as well as \nmeans of employment, income, and food from agriculture. Families, particularly the women and \nchildren,  are  now  fetching  water  from  distant  alternative  sources.  Drinking  water,  where \navailable, is often contaminated or of poor quality, containing excessive quantities of mineral \nsalts and bacterial organisms. Consequently, the population in the drought-affected areas is \nexposed to high risks of waterborne diseases and longer-term consequences of consuming high \nlevels  of  waterborne  minerals  that  lead  to  carcinogenic  and  immunological  conditions.  In \nrecognition of the urgency of the problem, the Government has embarked on a program for \nimmediate relief that is receiving extensive support from the international community. Through \naid coordination, the Project will focus on improving water supply and related health gains to the \nrural population in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm where over 60 percent of the people are poor. \n \n38.  The Government also recognizes the need to better manage the use of water from the \nAmudarya River, including sustainable abstraction for agricultural purposes together with the \nestablishment  of  suitable  cropping  strategies  while  meeting  the  needs  of  the  people  of \n                                                 \n21 Resolution 243, On Measures for Implementing the Rural Water Supply Project in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, \napproved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 8 June 1998. ", "  13   \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.22  These  initiatives  must  be  supported  by  strengthening \ninstitutional capacity for rural water supply to ensure sustainable delivery of services. The \nProject will provide capacity building for local water supply management, and for community \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  viable  water  conservation  measures.  In  particular,  the \nProject will strengthen the sustainability of potable water supplies to ensure secure and regular \navailability, largely independent of seasonal variations in raw water resources. By focusing on \nrural communities, the Project will improve the quality of life of a large proportion of poor people. \nThe Project is in line with the Government\u2019s policy to improve the livelihood of the people in \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  and  ADB\u2019s  human  development  and  poverty  reduction \nobjectives. It supports ADB\u2019s ongoing and planned activities (footnotes 16, 17, 18, and 19) to \nimprove the country\u2019s water sector. The Project will allow ADB to play a key role in the joint \neffort by international financing agencies to assist the Government in combating the water \nshortage and drought problems in the poorest part of the country. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n39.  The main objective of the Project is to improve the living and health conditions in the \nrural communities in Karakalpalstan and Khorezm. The Project will mitigate the ongoing effects \nof the drought by (i) providing safe and easily accessible water supply by reinforcing existing, \nand developing new, sustainable water supply facilities, particularly to improve the service \ncoverage in rural areas; (ii) supporting water conservation measures, including improvements in \nO&M practices and public awareness, to minimize water wastage; and (iii) improving the health \nconditions of the population by providing sanitation facilities and services related to better \nhygiene practices. About 450,000 people in Karakalpakstan and about 250,000 in Khorezm, of \nwhom the majority are poor, will benefit from the Project.23 \n \n40.  The World Bank and ADB have coordinated closely during project preparation to ensure \nthat the Project and World Bank\u2019s ongoing project in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm complement \neach other and support the Government\u2019s drought relief program.24 As a result, the Project \nemphasizes securing water supply to the rural communities. The Project comprises three parts: \npotable  water  supply,  water  conservation  and  health  improvement,  and  capacity  building. \nPotable water supply includes the development of bulk pumping and trunk mains, while local \nsupply includes the introduction of new facilities where none currently exists and rehabilitation of \nnonfunctional supply and distribution systems. The aim is to expand the coverage of potable \nwater supply in rural districts from 12 percent minimum25 to 85 percent, reduce unaccounted for \nwater losses from in excess of 50 percent to 30 percent of supply, increase supply efficiency, \nand  lower  unit  costs.  Water  conservation  includes  the  introduction  of  measures  such  as \nmetering and encouragement of reduced wastage. Health improvement includes upgrading the \nsanitation facilities of public institutions such as schools and clinics, and promoting water- and \nsanitation-related  health  awareness.  Capacity  building  includes  support  for  community \ninteractive  project  management  and  institutional  strengthening  for  potable  water  resource \nmanagement.  The  objective  and  overall  scope  of  the  Project  are  in  accordance  with  the \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s water sector policy,26 which are to improve and expand the delivery of \n                                                 \n22 In support of this, ADB will provide further assistance in water resource management for agriculture (footnote 19) \nand will continue policy dialogue on water resource management at a subregional level. \n23 Covers about 25 percent of the population in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. \n24 The World Bank project was originally designed for urban water supply in the provincial capital cities of Nukus and \nUrgench and their vicinity. Due to the drought, some of the loan funds have been reallocated for improving rural \nwater supply. The work, involving mainly rehabilitation of existing hand pumps, desalination plants, and small \ntreatment plants, will cover about 15\u201320 percent of the need in the drought-affected areas. \n25 Some districts have a population coverage with access to potable water supply as low as 12 percent. \n26  ADB. 2000.  Water for All: Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. ", "  14   \nservices,  foster  the  conservation  of  water,  increase  system  efficiencies,  and  improve \ngovernance through capacity building of all stakeholders. \n \n1.  Part A: Potable Water Supply  \n \n41.  Bulk  Water  Supply.  This  component  will  strengthen  bulk  water  pumping  and \ntransmission into the districts in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. It will achieve improved security \nof water supply for most of the population already connected to bulk supplies and provide good \nquality water to new areas that will be served by distribution networks developed under the \nProject. New pumping and the strengthening and extension of trunk mains will transmit water to \nareas without existing access to clean water. \n \n42.  Deep Boreholes and Treatment Plants. This component will only cover districts in \nKarakalpakstan  as  Khorezm  has  no  deep  aquifer  resources.  The  subprojects  will  involve \nproviding  new  deep  boreholes  and  associated  pumping  equipment,  reservoir  storage,  and \ndesalination equipment. This water will then be chlorinated and pumped or delivered by water \ntankers to distribution points that currently have no access to clean water.  \n \n43.  Water Distribution Centers.  The Project will rehabilitate existing, and construct new, \nWDCs in various districts in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. The selection of the districts and \nsettlements will be undertaken at the start of the Project following subproject selection and \nprioritization procedures. The emphasis will be on securing the existing distribution of good \nquality water, and expanding or adding new supplies where appropriate. The subprojects will \ninclude the rehabilitation of approximately 20 existing WDCs and the provision of about 26 new \nones. Each WDC will comprise service reservoir storage, disinfection, metering, pumping, and \ndistribution network. The existing distribution network will be reviewed for efficiency of operation, \nand be upgraded where necessary. \n \n44.  Operational Equipment and Materials. This component will include modernizing the \nfacilities for the agrovodokanals in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. Laboratory sampling and \ntesting equipment will assist in water quality control; trench excavators, mobile compressors, \nand welding equipment will facilitate the repairing or laying of trunk mains; small tools and hand \nequipment will enable good maintenance to be carried out; and leakage detection equipment \nwill assist in minimizing network losses. The provision of necessary repair and maintenance \nfacilities at the agrovodokanals will also be covered under this component. \n \n2.  Part B: Water Conservation and Health Improvement \n \n45.  Water Conservation and Demand Management. According to a study by MMS in 2000 \non  demand  management  and  loss  reduction  in  the  urban  areas  of  Nukus  and  Urgench, \nappropriate repairs to distribution mains can readily achieve a 20 percent reduction in loss. \nLeakage control by replacing fragile and defective mains is therefore an important aspect of the \nProject. Use of water meters is another effective means to control the use of water. The Project \nwill assist with meter provision where local consumers agree. Other settlements and districts will \nbe provided with a minimum of bulk metering under the Project but with the intention that the \nbenefits from metered consumption will encourage many other users to have meters fitted as \nsoon as they can be afforded. \n \n46.  Sanitation and Health Awareness. The sanitation subprojects will focus on providing \nsupport to rural communities that rely on public and private pit latrines. Upgrading of latrines at \npremises of institutions such as kindergartens, schools, and clinics by introducing ventilated ", "  15   \nimproved  pit  latrine  principles  and  of  associated  access  to  a  water  supply  will  bring  both \npractical benefits and will raise the awareness and understanding of good hygiene practice. At \nselected village centers, individual ventilated improved pit latrines will be constructed, through \nconsultation with rural assemblies and women\u2019s committees, as demonstration units to enable \nthe people to understand both how to construct such latrines and the benefits accruing. The \nlinkage between good hygiene practice and health will be explained in printed and broadcast \nmaterial. \n \n3.  Part C: Capacity Building  \n \n47.  Institutional Development Program. To strengthen existing institutional capacity and \nto improve service delivery, a training program, social development measures, and consulting \nservices for institutional development and project management support will be provided. The \ntraining program will improve the skills of staff of local governments, agrovodokanals, and rural \nassemblies to efficiently implement, operate, and maintain the systems. Training and other \ncapacity building will include specific initiatives to (i) upgrade the computerized accounting \nsystem for financial management of the total operation by introducing new software; (ii) provide \ntraining  on  water  supply  management;  (iii)  provide  training  on  operational  management, \nparticularly aimed at asset management; and (iv) initiate a public awareness campaign to \nencourage willingness to pay. \n \n48.  Social development measures to improve the distribution and penetration of benefits will \nbe provided in the form of education and awareness initiatives to support the overall goals and \nobjectives of provision. These will include (i) provision of demonstration ventilated improved pit \nlatrines at local centers; (ii) public health awareness campaigns run by women and NGOs to \nenable the full benefits of improved drinking water supply and good hygiene facilities to be \nrealized; and (iii) community participation and consumer rights awareness programs to improve \nthe  capacity  of  consumers  to  participate  in  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement. These will be implemented with the support of CBOs and NGOs, and will include \nthe rural assemblies in project design and implementation.  \n \n49.  Project  Management.  Project  management  consulting  services  will  assist  in \nimplementing the Project by providing project management support to local governments and \nagrovodokanals. The consulting services will also involve socioeconomic surveys, community \nconsultations, and participation in project implementation with the support of CBOs and NGOs. \nThe services will cover subproject development, procurement activities, financial management \nand  monitoring,  implementation  of  the  training  program,  support  to  social  development \nmeasures, supervision of implementation, and quality control of construction of the physical \ncomponents of the Project. \n \nC.  Technical Justification \n \n50.  Drought in the regions of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm has highlighted an already \ndisastrous  situation  whereby  insufficient  raw  water  exists  to  support  the  needs  of  both \nagriculture use and human consumption. Water shortage in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm has \nbeen largely a result of excessive use of water for agriculture, which accounts for about 95 \npercent of the water produced (paras. 6, 7, 33 and 38). This issue, which requires interregional \ncooperation,  is  being  undertaken  at  the  Government  level  and  supported  by  international \ndevelopment  agencies  including  ADB  through  assistance  in  regional  water  resource \nmanagement and changes in agricultural practices (paras. 9, 24, and 25). The focus of this \nProject is to contribute to longer-term potable water supply and to strengthen the institutional ", "  16   \ncapacity for water supply management. The drying of the Amudarya River has resulted in a \nlarge proportion of the population having to resort to alternative and unsafe sources. Short-term \nassistance with the provision of hand pumps and boreholes cannot be relied upon in the future \nas nonreplenished resources are exhausted. The Project seeks to develop alternative potable \nwater resources and introduce demand management, which will solve the long-term needs of \nthe population while supporting the short- and medium-term programs of the Government. The \nproposed technology is the most cost-effective and will benefit the rural population with the \nprovision of a secure and wholesome supply of water. The project cost estimate of less than \n$100/capita is within the normal bounds of rural water supply projects funded by ADB. In parallel \nwith water supply will be the improvement of sanitary hygiene facilities at public centers where \nchildren in particular will understand the advantages and benefits of clean toilets and good \nhygiene practice. The high incidence of water-related health problems in the regions will be \ndiminished and with it the direct costs of treatment and the indirect loss of opportunity costs. \nThe introduction and application of modern techniques for the efficient management and O&M \nof water resources and potable water supply systems will be provided under the Project to \nassist in functional sustainability. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n51.  The total project cost is estimated at $65.0 million equivalent (at February 2002 prices), \nof which $37.0 million or 56.9 percent is the foreign exchange cost and $28.0 million equivalent \nor 43.1 percent the local currency cost.

Financing Plan \n \n52.  The Government of Uzbekistan will provide $27.0 million equivalent counterpart funding \nto the Project and has requested a loan of $38.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the Project.27 The ADB loan will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and 3.6 \npercent of the local currency cost. The local currency financing is required to fund the entire \ncapacity  building  and  project  management  component  to  ensure  that  the  institutional \nstrengthening objective will be achieved. The loan represents 58.5 percent of the total cost. The \nADB cost-sharing limit under the Graduation Policy for Uzbekistan for 2002 is 40 percent. \nHowever, crop failure and the drop in the price of cotton, the country\u2019s main export earnings, in \nthe last few years, has resulted in a decline in economic performance. Gross domestic product \ngrowth decreased from 4.3 percent in 1998 to 3.8 percent in 2001; gross national income \ndropped from $870 in 1998 to $540 in 2001; and debt/export ratio of goods and services \nincreased from 94 percent in 1998 to 140 percent in 2001.28 Sixty percent counterpart funding \nrepresents  an  extraordinarily  high  financial  burden  for  the  Government  whose  revenues, \nparticularly foreign exchange, have suffered significant erosion due to the impact of transition \nand the drought in the last two years. The fiscal constraint is expected to continue in the next \nfew years. Increasing ADB\u2019s cost-sharing from 40 to 58.5 percent is required to ensure timely \nimplementation of the Project, which is essential to provide basic potable water supply to the \nrural population that are suffering from the drought.29 The Borrower will be the Republic of \nUzbekistan. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.75 percent per annum, and a front-end fee of 1 percent, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under the LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The proposed \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   Percent \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \n         \n  Asian Development Bank  37.0  1.0  38.0  58.5 \n  Government of Uzbekistana  0.0  27.0  27.0  41.5 \n  Total  37.0  28.0  65.0  100.0 \na Includes national Government budget allocations and exemption from taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n27 The French Government has in principle agreed to provide parallel financing for the installation of new desalination \nplants under the Project. The exact amount is being determined by the Ministry of Finance in Paris. The indicative \namount for 2002 is about $2.0 million. Upon confirmation from the French Government, the ADB loan amount may \nbe reduced accordingly. \n28 Sources: World Bank and Government of Uzbekistan estimates. \n29 The financing arrangement for the parallel World Bank project in Karakapakstan and Khorezm is 64 percent from \nWorld Bank, 25.1 percent from the Kuwait Fund and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany, and 10.9 percent \nfrom the Government of Uzbekistan. The financing arrangement for a recently approved urban water supply project  \nin Samarkand and Bukhara, which are richer cities and better able to guarantee counterpart funding, is 64.5 \npercent from the World Bank (of which half is from the International Development Association), 14.5 percent from \nthe Government of Switzerland, and 21 percent from the Government.

The Executing Agency \n \n53.  MMS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  have  overall  responsibility  for  project \ncoordination and implementation, and liaison with ADB and with other government ministries \nand  departments.  MMS  is  one  of  the  most  senior  ministries  within  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan  and  is  responsible  for  a  range  of  departmental  functions.  Within  MMS  is  a \ndepartment for rural infrastructure development, the major function of which is directed to \nimproving  water  supply  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  MMS  is  the  coordinator  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s Aral Sea Program and is the executing agency for, among others, the World \nBank project in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. It has in-house technical capacity together with \nconsiderable experience in dealing with rehabilitating and upgrading water supply networks. \nMMS is also well positioned to coordinate the activities of the proposed Project with other \nexternally financed projects in the sector. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Execution and Coordination  \n \n54.  To ensure close coordination of the Project with the ongoing World Bank project and \nother externally financed activities in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, the existing interministerial \nproject steering committee (PSC) for the World Bank project will also be responsible for project \ncoordination and policy guidance for the proposed Project. The deputy minister of MMS chairs \nthe PSC and members include representatives from the Department of Foreign Economic \nRelations and Investment, Ministry of Finance, UCSA, and the governments of Karakalpakstan \nand Khorezm. The PSC is responsible for (i) setting policy guidelines for improving project \nimplementation, (ii) coordinating at the policy level with other ministries, agencies and other \ndonors in the project area, (iii) reviewing and approving annual implementation plans, (iv)  \nmonitoring the progress of project implementation, and (v) coordinating procurement activities \nand awarding of contacts. The project implementation structure is in Appendix 5. \n \n55.  A project management unit (PMU) within MMS and project implementation units (PIUs) \nin Karakalpakstan and Khorezm will be established prior to loan effectiveness.30 The PIUs will \nbe  set  under  each  of  the  local  governments  to  manage  the  subprojects  and  the  various \nagencies involved at the local level. The PMU will include a full-time manager and two full-time \nstaff to manage and coordinate the work of the two PIUs, provide technical support to PSC, as \nwell as coordinate with the World Bank project implementation unit in MMS. The PIUs will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  detailed  implementation  activities  among  the  various  agencies \ninvolved at the local level (e.g. UCSA branches, TCSAs, agrovodokanals, local governments, \nand the World Bank project implementation units at the local level) and will report to the PMU. \nResponsibilities of the PIUs include financial management of project and subproject accounts, \nprocurement activities, and local community liaison. Each of the PIUs will have a full-time \nmanager and four to five full-time staff. The trunk main agencies and agrovodokanals will be \nresponsible for the day-to-day project implementation activities and will report, through the PIUs, \nto  the  PMU.  The  agencies  and  agrovodokanals  will  be  responsible  for  activities  such  as \nconstruction supervision, O&M of assets, and collection of tariffs. The implementation structure \nand specific roles and responsibilities are summarized in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n30 The remuneration of key PMU and PIU staff who will be recruited as term employees will be included under the \nProject. Identification, selection, and remuneration levels of these key staff will be subjected to ADB approval. ", "  19   \n2.  Subproject Formulation and Approval  \n \n56.  The Project will cover rural communities that lack basic potable water supply services. \nSubprojects  under  Part  A,  Potable  Water  Supply,  will  be  identified,  appraised,  prioritized, \ndesigned,  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  in  Appendix  6.  The \nGovernment will ensure that the settlements and districts suffering the greatest hardship from \nthe  effects  of  the  drought  will  be  given  the  highest  priority.  Subprojects  with  a  total  cost \nexceeding  $200,000  and  those  having  social  and  environmental  issues  will  require  ADB \napproval.  The  Government  will  include  detailed  information  on  the  scope,  coverage,  and \nbeneficiaries  of  these  subprojects  in  the  progress  reports  that  will  be  submitted  to  ADB. \nSubprojects under Part B, Water Conservation and Health Improvement, will also be selected \nand appraised in accordance with the criteria in Appendix 6. The Government will ensure that \nadequate local budget exists for the proper maintenance of the facilities provided, and that \nwherever  a  piped  water  supply  is  provided  under  the  Project,  improvements  to  sanitation \nfacilities at all kindergartens, schools, and clinics will be provided. Since each of these sanitation \nsubprojects is unlikely to cost more than $200,000, no prior approval by the ADB is required. \n \n57.  Each subproject feasibility study will include a financing plan showing the percentage of \nthe  estimated  subproject  cost  to  be  financed  by  the  loan  and  counterpart  funds  from  the \nGovernment.  The  feasibility  study  should  also  include  social  and  environmental  impact \nassessments. If any subproject involves resettlement, the PMU in coordination with the PIUs will \nprepare a resettlement action plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement and \nrelevant local guidelines. The plan will include assurances that land acquisition and resettlement \nwill  be  undertaken  and  affected  people  will  be  compensated  following  this  plan.  The \nGovernment will provide a copy of the plan to ADB before approval of the relevant subproject. \nAs part of each subproject appraisal, the PMU in coordination with the PIUs will carry out an \nenvironmental  screening.  Where  appropriate,  an  initial  environmental  examination  and,  if \nrequired, an environmental impact assessment, will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Requirement and relevant local procedures.    \n \n3.  Budgetary Support and Channeling of Funds  \n \n58.  The  PMU,  under  the  supervision  of  the  PSC,  will  undertake  central  procurement, \nincluding the capacity building component and the packages for materials and equipment. The \nPIU will undertake procurement of all other goods and services, and transfer the physical assets \nto the agrovodokanals. Counterpart funds will be channeled to the implementing agencies \nthrough  regular  budgetary  allocations.  Exemptions  from  taxes  and  duties  will  also  be \nrecognized. The ADB loan funds will be disbursed either through reimbursement to the PMU \nand  PIUs,  or  through  direct  payment  to  the  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants.  The \nagrovodokanals  will  receive  revenue  from  tariffs  and  charges  to  consumers,  as  well  as \nsubsidies from the Government for O&M.  \n \n59.  At  the  start  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  help  the  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm \nadministrations formulate the draft project expenditures for all activities, with estimates for each \nyear of project implementation. These budgets will be reviewed and updated every six months \nand approved by the PMU before implementation. Expenditures will be recorded at source by \nthe implementing agencies, PIUs, and PMU. The PMU will approve and supervise all drawdown \narrangements. The PMU will be responsible for compiling project expenditures based on its own \nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  the  PIUs.  It  will  report  project \nexpenditures to MMS and the PSC, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis, with quarterly and \nannual summaries. ", "  20   \n4.  Anticorruption \n \n60.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the sections on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to \nobserve the highest standards of ethics for the procurement and execution of ADB-financed \ncontracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are  discovered.  The  anticorruption \nprovisions  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  were  discussed.  The  project \nmanagement  consulting  services  include  assistance  to  strengthen  the  implementation \narrangements, including internal auditing procedures. The international project management \nconsultants will assist in strengthening the procedures for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants,  increasing  transparency,  and  providing  for  equal  opportunity  competition.  The \nconsultants will help to (i) strengthen the financial management system of the local governments \nand concerned agencies, (ii) conduct training to promote full and consistent adherence to \ninternational accounting standards and auditing procedures, and (iii) draft procurement and \nbidding documents to strengthen the ability to detect fraud and corruption. The Government is \nincreasingly  concerned  with  governance  issues  and  has  committed  to  (i)  create  a  strong \nmechanism of checks and balances, (ii) strengthen nongovernment and public associations, (iii) \nreinforce the legal basis for reforms, (iv) support the gradual transfer of government powers of \nstate bodies to citizens\u2019 bodies for self-government and other nongovernment agencies, (v) \nencourage decentralization, and (vi) ensure the independence of the judiciary.31 \n \n5.  Implementation Schedule  \n \n61.  The Project will be implemented over three years and is expected to commence in the \nbeginning of October 2002 and be completed by the end of September 2005. To ensure rapid \nprogress, the Government has agreed to a time-bound implementation schedule with critical \nmilestones. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. With the preparatory work in \nprogress, and design for major structures already completed, the implementation schedule is \nconsidered to be realistic. \n \n6.  Procurement \n \n62.  Procurement of goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts valued at over $1.0 \nmillion and contracts for goods and related services above $500,000 will be undertaken through \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Civil works contracts valued at $1.0 million or less \nwill be carried out under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Contracts for \ngoods  and  services  valued  at  or  under  $500,000  will  be  procured  following  international \nshopping procedures except for supply contracts with a value of less than $100,000 equivalent, \nwhich may be procured by direct purchase. The proposed procurement packages and their \nestimated costs are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n7.  Consulting Services \n \n63.  The  Project  will  require  consulting  services  in  the  fields  of  potable  water  resource \nmanagement, project management, water supply and sanitation, procurement, health and public \nawareness  education,  financial  and  accounting  advice,  poverty  reduction  and  community \nparticipation, and community-based water resource management. Consulting services will assist \n                                                 \n31  Resolution No. 296 of the Cabinet of Ministers, 10 June 1999. ", "  21   \nin  (i)  developing  and  supporting  the  institutional  development  program  on  potable  water \nresource management, information campaigns to promote water conservation, and willingness \nto  pay  for  water  usage;  (ii)  selecting  subprojects;  (iii)  preparing  detailed  feasibility  and \nengineering design studies, including socioeconomic, technical, and environmental surveys; (iv) \npreparing contract packages and documents and procurement activities; (v) evaluating project \nactivities;  (vi)  supervising,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  project  activities;  (vii)  supporting  the \nmanagement and activities of the PMU and PIUs; (viii) helping staff prepare loan withdrawal \napplications  and  supporting  documents;  (ix)  mobilizing  community  participation  in  the \ndevelopment and ownership of subprojects; (x) introducing the public to the concepts and \nimportance of minimizing water losses/wastage and of water use in personal hygiene with \nlinkages to improved health; and (xi) maintaining accurate and sufficient project accounting \nrecords in accordance with international accounting standards. A total of 254 person-months (32 \nperson-months  international  and  222  person-months  domestic)  of  consulting  services  are \nrequired. The international consultants will be engaged by MMS in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants based on the quality and cost-based selection method, \nand other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \ninternational  consultants  will  contract  with  suitable  NGOs  and  CBOs  for  the  design  and \nimplementation of subprojects. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 9. \n \n64.  The  institutional  development  program  will  include  training  of  existing  and  new \ngovernment and concerned agencies\u2019 staff on water supply management and O&M of water \nsupply schemes. The program will focus on introducing the agrovodokanals to water demand \nmanagement techniques and the consumer-response management of supplying water such that \npublic confidence and willingness of the population to pay an economic charge for water is \nincreased. The program involves (i) providing project information to customers; (ii) providing \ngood  quality  water  as  agreed;  (iii)  developing  capabilities,  including  planning,  engineering, \nfinancial,  accounting,  billing,  tariff  setting  and  collection,  and  operations;  (iv)  effectively \nresponding to problems and complaints; (v) establishing and ensuring continued attention to \npreventive maintenance programs; and (vi) carefully monitoring system performance.    \n \n65.  The PMU and PIUs, in coordination with the health departments in Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm and with assistance from the consultants, will work with NGOs to develop hygiene and \nhealth  awareness  programs  for  the  health  departments  and  CBOs,  such  as  the  rural \nassemblies. The programs will include (i) communication campaigns to educate the population \non the causes, effects, and prevention of waterborne and related diseases; (ii) specification and \nstandard setting for health awareness campaigns in areas such as maintenance of sanitation \nfacilities, food storage and preparation, and personal hygiene in houses and small businesses; \nand (iii) communication and training programs for local NGO staff and volunteers, including \nwomen\u2019s  and  youth  groups  to  implement  the  programs  with  the  community  in  the  project \ncommunities. \n \n8.  Disbursements \n \n66.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections, \nrequesting budgetary allocations for the counterpart funds, collecting supporting documents, \npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with the ADB Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. To facilitate implementation of the Project, an imprest account in \ndollars will be established at the PMU level at a bank acceptable to ADB. The PMU will be \nresponsible for timely release of imprest funds to the PIUs as needed. The imprest account will \nbe established only after the project-financed financial management adviser is fielded and ADB \nconfirms the establishment of sufficient financial management and accounting systems at the ", "  22   \nPMU and the PIUs. The initial ceiling of the imprest account will be $250,000. The imprest \naccount will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook and with detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances from \nthe imprest account. \n \n9.  Accounts, Audits, and Reports  \n \n67.  The Government will ensure records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds will be maintained. The PIUs will maintain separate \nproject accounts, in coordination with the PMU, which will prepare the project accounts and \nrelated financial statements, including for the imprest account and records of the statement of \nexpenditures. Project accounts and financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of \nsuch audited accounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB within nine months \nafter the close of each fiscal year. All such reports and statements will be submitted in English. \nThe Government has agreed to finance the costs related to the annual auditing from the loan \nproceeds. MMS and the PIUs were informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submission of audited \nfinancial statements and the strict penalties for noncompliance. The PMU and ADB may review \nand audit these records on a random basis. \n \n68.  The  PIUs,  in  coordination  with  the  PMU,  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the \nimplementation of project-funded activities. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB \nand will indicate, among other things, progress made against established targets, problems \nencountered during the quarter, steps taken and steps proposed to resolve the problems, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be undertaken during the next quarter. \nA project completion report will be prepared within three months of project completion. All \nreports will be submitted in English. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \na.  Annual Operation Plans and Financial Review \n \n69.  To facilitate project implementation, MMS will prepare by 30 September 2002, and \nthereafter by 30 September of each year, an operation plan for the next fiscal year. The plan will \ninclude (i) proposed budgetary allocations for subproject works, and specifically, the allocation \nof sufficient counterpart funds from the central Government and other sources for timely project \nimplementation; (ii) status of policy actions; and (iii) financing plan for the project activities for \nthe succeeding year. The plan will confirm that the Government has allocated an adequate \nbudget for financing project implementation and recurrent costs. \n \nb.  Project Performance Monitoring System \n \n70.  The  PIUs  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  evaluate  the \ndelivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued. The PMU, with the assistance \nof the consultants, will develop comprehensive performance monitoring procedures and plans in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s handbook within three months after loan effectiveness. The PIUs, with \nguidance from the Uzbekistan Resident Mission, will carry out project performance monitoring \nactivities, including establishing benchmarks, collecting information, monitoring benefits, and \nevaluating social and environmental impacts. Data collection will be carried out prior to the start \nof the physical implementation of the Project and in conjunction with community participation. It ", "  23   \nwill then continue on a regular basis during project implementation until three months after \nproject completion. The results will be incorporated in the project progress and completion \nreports. \n \nc.  Annual and Midterm Review \n \n71.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  project  reviews  to  assess \nprogress, identify constraints, and agree on strategies for resolving such constraints. More than \none review per year is expected for the first year. In addition, ADB and the Government will \ncarry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  in  the  second  year  of  project  implementation \n(2003/04). The Government will ensure that the midterm review is informed of any policy or \nimplementation changes affecting the local governments and the water supply sector, and if \nnecessary, recommend changes in design and implementation. The midterm review will (i) \nreview the scope, design, and implementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes \nneeded since the time of project appraisal; (iii) assess implementation performance against \nproject indicators; (iv) review and establish compliance with loan covenants; and (v) identify \nproblems  and  constraints  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or \nimplementation arrangements. \n \n11.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n72.  Due to the urgency of the situation prevailing in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, the \nGovernment has asked ADB to approve advance action for the establishment of the PMU and \nthe two PIUs, as well as for consultant recruitment. The Government has been informed that \napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the whole or any part of the \nProject. In the event the Project is approved, ADB will finance up to $1,000,000 on a retroactive \nbasis for all expenditures incurred after 4 February 2002 for these project activities. \n \n12.  Community Participation \n \n73.  A participatory approach will be adopted to select and formulate the subprojects during \nimplementation.  A  particular  focus  of  the  participatory  program  will  be  on  meeting  and \nprioritizing the needs of the poor. The capacity building component will provide training for local \nNGOs and CBOs to participate in managing and maintaining the subproject facilities in the long \nterm. \n \n74.  The  main  selection  criteria  for  NGO  participation  in  the  Project  will  be  (i)  a  well-\nestablished track record of activities and social networks in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, (ii) \nexperience in public health, (iii) experience in mounting publicity campaigns, (iv) evidence of \ninvolvement of women and people of all ethnic origins in the project area, (v) experience in \nkeeping accounts and making progress reports, (vi) willingness to receive specialist training \nfrom national or international NGOs, and (vii) ability to commit the needed staff resources full-\ntime for the required duration of the Project. \n \n13.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n75.  Infrastructure  development  requires  supply  of  equipment,  materials,  and  contracting \nservices. A strong support industry is an essential element for good utility performance. A \nprivate support industry for the water supply sector, especially rural water supply, is evolving \nonly slowly in Uzbekistan. Most services are delivered through state agencies, publicly owned \nself-financing organizations, or recently privatized companies that provide similar services as ", "  24   \nwere offered by the former state-owned enterprises, institutes, and ministries. Greater private \nsector participation will result in competition that allows utilities and consumers to choose the \nbest  contract  in  terms  of  quality  and  cost.  The  Project  will  provide  opportunities  for  the \ndevelopment of (i) a diversified private consulting capacity by contracting research and design \ninstitutes that are privatized or operate on market principles; (ii) a responsive and efficient \ndomestic industry to supply quality equipment and materials by procuring from privatized state \nequipment manufacturers and material suppliers; (iii) civil works contractors that are capable of \nproviding quality services by contracting the privatized state civil works contractors; (iv) small-\nscale  enterprises  that  can  offer  construction  and  O&M  services;  (v)  NGOs  that  can  help \ncommunities maintain the infrastructure facilities; and (vi) local consulting businesses, survey \ncompanies, and individuals. \n \n14.  Operation and Maintenance  \n \n76.  The intention of the Project is that all investment should be owned and managed by the \nlocal  operating  organizations.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  technical  capabilities  and \noperational practices of the agrovodokanals, and will provide technical training and essential \nplant and equipment for these purposes. Maintenance practices will be established to ensure \nsustainability of the capital assets and maximize efficiency of operation. System performance \nwill  be  monitored  and  procedures  for  corrective  action  will  be  set  up.  The  beneficiary \ncommunities will participate in the decision process to the degree to which they are required or \nprepared to support local distribution and assume responsibility for their local supply network, \nwhich  will  include  metering,  either  bulk  or  individual.  This  mobilization  of  local  community \norganizations to nominate their particular water delivery requirements and thus accept a degree \nof ownership and responsibility for the operation and performance of the same will support \nsustainability of the project facilities and services. \n \n15.  Cost Recovery  \n \n77.  The Government agreed that the agrovodokanals should prioritize O&M expenditure to \nensure that existing and future service delivery is sustainable. Based on the financial data of \nagrovodokanals, current tariff levels and overall revenues are low, and revenue is insufficient to \ncarry out repair and maintenance of the existing network or extend services to more remote \nvillages. Existing tariffs cover only about 30 to 40 percent of O&M cost. Tariff collection is about \n30 percent of the billed amounts and unaccounted for water is over 50 percent of supply. To \nenable the agrovodokanals to raise and collect tariffs that will sufficiently cover their O&M \nexpenditures, the existing service levels will have to be improved to a satisfactory level, both in \nquantity and quality of water provided to the rural communities. Given the economic difficulties \nfacing the rural population in the project area, tariffs cannot be increased in the short term to \nachieve full cost recovery of O&M and capital investment for the Project. The proposed stepped \ntariff, with a lifeline tariff for the lowest income population, will likely initially achieve only partial \nrecovery of O&M cost. Full cost recovery of O&M cost and partial recovery of the project capital \ncost are targeted within 10 years of project completion. To ensure sustainability of the project \nfacilities, the Government has assured that the tariff revenue will be prioritized for O&M. The \ncapacity building component of the Project will provide training on financial management of the \nagrovodokanals.  Through  improved  service  delivery  and  customer  willingness  to  pay,  the \nfinancial viability of the agrovodokanals is expected to slowly improve. \n \n \n \n ", "  25   \nH.  Environmental and Social Measures \n \n1.  Environmental Impacts  \n \n78.  The Project is intended to implement a series of urgent schemes to improve availability \nof potable water supplies, assist in good management practices, and support rural sanitation. \nThe overall impact will be a substantial improvement in public health and quality of life, while \nmaintaining or improving the quality of water resources. Being a category B project, an initial \nenvironmental examination was undertaken using criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects (Appendix 10). None of the components will \ncause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  based  on  the  screening  of  possible \nenvironmental consequences using ADB checklists. \n \n79.  The project physical activities involve rehabilitating or constructing new pumping stations \nand  trunk  mains,  drilling  new  deep  boreholes  and  introducing  desalination  equipment, \nrehabilitating existing and providing new WDCs, strengthening distribution networks to rural \ncommunities, and improving sanitation facilities in education and medical establishments. These \nactivities will be undertaken largely in rural areas, away from any densely populated localities. \nThe major permanent works will be either underground, i.e., pipelines, or in existing compounds \ndedicated for water supply facilities, i.e., water treatment and distribution centers. The new land \nrequired for WDCs will not involve resettlement of the population and no loss of crop production \nwill result from the Project, since surplus, uncultivated land is not in short supply.  \n \n80.  Some sites of historic and cultural interest are located in the area, although none of \nknown ecological importance. The design of each subproject will take account of the known \nsites, if any, and will ensure that they remain protected and free from any deleterious effect of \nthe project work. The impact of construction activities will be limited in duration and extent, \ntraffic flow and problems of noise and dust from construction activities will be temporary, and \nsuitable mitigation measures will be taken to minimize these impacts. All major or minor pipe \nroutes  will  be  away  from  habitation  and  will  follow  the  alignment  of  existing  infrastructure \nservices such as roads, gas, electricity, and telecommunications. Appropriate arrangements will \nbe put in place for the safe disposal of sewage sludge from latrine blocks. Overall, adverse \nenvironmental impacts of the Project are insignificant as compared with the benefits accruing. \n \n2.  Social Measures \n \n81.  A social analysis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions and \nHandbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects was undertaken to evaluate the \nstatus of water supply and the demands of the rural population living in Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm. Views of the community concerned were obtained regarding their potable water \nneeds and willingness to pay fees for the services. The results of the social analysis are \nincorporated in project formulation as outlined in Appendix 11. The social analysis indicates that \nthe potential beneficiaries show a high level of interest and support for the Project. To ensure \nthat the Project benefits will be affordable to the target population, tariff increases will be \nimplemented in a staged manner with regular reviews taking into consideration the income level \nof the rural population. Project implementation does not require any resettlement. \n \n82.  A random survey of the target population was conducted to yield information pertinent to \ndesigning aspects of the Project that would address the needs of the poor. The findings of the \nsurvey provide a socioeconomic profile (Appendix 11), which provides the basis for including \nspecific social measures. Such elements are mechanisms to ensure that all users, particularly ", "  26   \nthe poor and women, will be able to participate in project implementation, receive the benefits of \nimproved water supply, and are willing and can afford to pay for the water services. The \ninvolvement of rural assemblies and related support for their activities is consistent with the \ncultural tradition of community participation, embodied in the local committee system. Women\u2019s \ninvolvement  will  be  facilitated  through  the  existing  rural  assembly  system  where  women \ncommittees are represented. These features are expected to serve as the keystone for (i) \ninteraction  between  service  providers  with  consumers;  (ii)  coordination  of  line  ministries \nresponsible for promoting water conservation awareness, drinking water, and health standards; \nand (iii) provision of a voice for the target population to alert the responsible authorities to their \nparticular  needs  or  problems.  In  short,  these  built-in  features  are  socially  sound  and  will \nencourage stakeholder ownership and accountability for project implementation. \n \nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n1.  Economic Analysis  \n \n83.  The Project will improve potable water supplies to rural communities in Karakalpakstan \nand Khorezm that are currently deprived of basic water needs as a result of water shortage in \nthe region that has been exacerbated by the drought. The Project will (i) increase rural water \nsupply service coverage; (ii) generate efficiency gains, reducing distribution leakage, and water \nand electricity costs; (iii) improve cost recovery through better service delivery and customer \nservice; (iv) reduce natural resource depletion; and (v) improve public health by reducing the \nincidence of waterborne diseases. \n \n84.  The economic benefits identified were based on two sample subprojects, one in Bozatau \ndistrict in Karakalpakstan and the other in Koshkupir district in Khorezm. The benefits reflect \nsignificant poverty reduction and improvement in living conditions, in particular, health and \nhygiene of the rural population of whom over 60 percent is poor. Nonincremental benefits \ninclude  (i)  resource  cost  savings  from  customers  obtaining  water  from  other  sources,  (ii) \navailability of unaccounted for water to users after improvement of facilities under the Project, \nand (iii) health benefits. Incremental benefits include additional water sales to meet suppressed \nor increased demand of existing customers and additional sales to new customers who will be \nconnected to the piped network, based on customers\u2019 willingness to pay.   \n \n85.  Resource cost savings or time savings to collect water is a major economic benefit of the \nProject. According to the socioeconomic survey, 60 percent of the households indicated that \ndue to the water shortage in the region, which has been further intensified by the drought, they \nhave to walk to faraway wells to find water.32 At least 2.5 hours are spent each day in the \nsummer and at least 1.5 hours in the winter to collect water. Unaccounted for water is currently \nat over 50 percent of the total water produced. Improvement to the water supply facilities and \nbetter leakage control under the Project is expected to reduce the unaccounted for water to 30 \npercent.  Water  resource  conservation  benefits  will  be  achieved  through  water  demand \nmanagement  impacts  of  users  paying  cost-based  tariffs  and  reduced  water  wastage.  The \n                                                 \n32 Official data from the agrovodokanals indicate that about 73 percent of rural households in the sample subproject \ndistrict of Koshkupir and about 46 percent in the sample district of Bozatau do not have water connections and \nhave to obtain and carry water from other sources. Of those households with piped water connections, supply is \nscheduled with the majority receiving water for only 2\u20133 hours per day. The consumption level is therefore low at \nabout 45 liters per day per household or less than 10 liters per capita per day. The suppressed demand is very \nhigh. ", "  27   \nProject will also bring significant health benefits from improved quantity and quality of water, \nimproved sanitation facilities, and better hygiene practices, thereby reducing the morbidity rate \nand costs of treatment of waterborne diseases of the rural population. \n \n86.  The incremental benefits of increased sales are based on the difference between the \ncurrent level of usage at less than 10 liters per capita per day (lcd) and the estimated increased \nconsumption to a minimum of 60 lcd as a result of the Project. This benefit is estimated using \nthe consumer\u2019s willingness to pay survey results. \n \n87.  The Project will also provide indirect economic benefits by training concerned agencies\u2019 \nstaff in technical and financial management, institutional development, and local community \ngovernance. Other benefits cannot be quantified but will accrue in general terms to economic \ndevelopment of the project area as a result of improved water supply and sanitation. These \ninclude increased economic activities and output of commerce and industry, and improved \noperations of institutions such as schools and hospitals that require secure and safe water \nsupply.  \n \n88.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation was undertaken in constant 2002 \nprices  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  since  the  outputs  are  nontradable  in  nature. \nEconomic costs, excluding taxes and financial prices, are converted using factors of (i) 1.4 for \nthe shadow exchange rate factor (SERF),33 and (ii) 0.8 for labor. The EIRRs for the sample \nsubprojects in Bozatau district and Khoskupir district are 18.0 and 19.9 percent, exceeding the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be 12 percent. Switching values and \nsensitivity indicators were tested using the SERF at 2.1 and increase in capital and O&M cost \nby 40 percent. The subprojects were found to be economically viable under adverse cost-benefit \nscenarios. A summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n \n89.  A  financial  appraisal  was  undertaken  for  each  sample  subproject,  comparing  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital;  and  the \naverage incremental cost with the average incremental revenue. Costs include capital costs in \nline with the implementation schedule, operational costs, and replacement costs. Estimates of \nO&M costs consider improvements in efficiency, particularly in the use of electricity, volume of \nwater produced, and specific maintenance requirements for the facilities created under the \nProject. Only additional costs resulting from the Project were included in the FIRR calculation. \nRevenue from direct user charges is at an assumed collection rate of 65 percent. This is a \nconsiderable improvement on the current collection rate, which is about 30 to 40 percent.  \n \n90.  The  FIRRs  for  the  sample  subprojects  in  Bozatau  and  Koshkupir  are  3.9  and  4.8 \npercent.  Both  exceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  which  is  about  2.1  percent,  \ndemonstrating that at proposed tariff levels the Project is financially viable. Switching values and \nsensitivity indicators were tested, and the subprojects were found to be financially viable under \nadverse cost and revenue scenarios. \n \n91.  Financial projections were prepared for the agrovodokanals for 2002 to 2025, the project \nperiod. Existing cash flow difficulties are expected to continue during project implementation \nsince poor service delivery is one of the main reasons for low tariff collection. This should not \naffect  project  implementation  since  all  counterpart  funds  are  financed  by  the  central \n                                                 \n33 The SERF is calculated based on the official exchange rate of SUM693 and the commercial rate of SUM990 (as of \nFebruary 2002). Sensitivity analysis has assumed the SERF at 2.1 based on the market rate of SUM1,480. ", "  28   \nGovernment through state budget allocations and project assets will be transferred to the \nagrovodokanals.  Currently,  the  Government  is  subsidizing  about  50  percent  of  the  O&M \nexpenses of the agrovodokanals. In view of the worsening economic situation in the project \narea, the Government recognizes that the necessity of continuing to subsidize operation of the \nagrovodokanals to ensure sustainable service delivery. Once service delivery improves and new \ncharging arrangements and tariff increases are in place in 2006, the financial performance of \nthe  agrovodokanals  will  improve  and  key  ratios  will  satisfy  requirements.  The  operating \nexpenditure to income ratio will be below 1.0 and the current asset to current liability ratio will be \nhigher than 1.0. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \n3.  Affordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n \n92.  Due to the economic difficulties in the project area, only partial recovery of O&M cost will \nbe achieved in the early years after completion of the project facilities (para. 77). Full cost \nrecovery of O&M cost is targeted within 10 years after completion of the project facilities. User \ncharges will need to be increased to ensure sustainability of project facilities and operation of \nthe  utility  agencies.  However,  the  charges  need  to  be  increased  in  stages  taking  into \nconsideration affordability for the beneficiaries; in particular the poor must be protected from \ncharge increases. The current tariff is based on a flat per capita charge irrespective of the \nvolume  of  water  consumed.  A  stepped  tariff  structure  is  proposed.  A  lifeline  tariff  for  low \nconsumption at a rate affordable to the lowest income users will be applied. Consumption in \nexcess of the lifeline block of 10 m3 per person per month will be charged at a higher rate. The \nproposed  tariff  structure  assumes  an  estimated  average  household  of  5.6  members  and \nconsumption of about 75 lcd for average income households with connections and 60 lcd, or \nabout 10m3 per month consumption, for low income households. An affordability analysis was \nundertaken to assess whether the proposed tariff is affordable to residential consumers, based \non estimated tariffs and household income data from the social survey.  \n \n93.  The  household  charges  were  compared  with  willingness  to  pay.  Results  from  the \nsocioeconomic survey showed that households were willing to pay an average of SUM300 per \nmonth for water. Proposed charges for average water consumption ranging from SUM260 to \nSUM310 per household are in line with the average willingness to pay. Proposed average \nhousehold charges were also compared with average household income. Water charges of less \nthan 5 percent of income are considered to be affordable, in line with ADB affordability criteria. \nProposed charges are about 3 to 5 percent of average household income. For very low-income \nresidents, proposed charges for 60 lcd were compared with the income of the poorest 10 \npercent of households. Proposed charges are lower than 5 percent of household income in the \nsample subproject districts. The detailed affordability analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nB.  Environment \n \n94.  The Project\u2019s physical components will have no adverse impact on the environment. \nMost of the physical work, including rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and new construction \nsuch as WDCs and additions to the distribution networks, will be on land already designated for \npublic services. These works will not encroach on sensitive ecological, cultural, or historical \nsites. Replaced pipes will be disposed of through metal recycling, and other wastes from \nexcavations and from demolition work will be disposed of in designated municipal landfills. The \nProject is expected to have a positive impact on the environment by improving the quantity and \nquality of delivered water to rural communities and providing simple sanitation facilities to \nschools and clinics. The abstraction and production of water will more closely match consumer \ndemand by reducing inefficiencies and losses. The use of metering and consumption-based ", "  29   \nbilling  will  encourage  conservation  by  users.  Continuous  environmental  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken as part of the project performance monitoring system to ensure construction quality \nand environmental management meets national standards. \n \nC.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Social and Health Impact \n \n95.  Supported by the public health awareness component, the supply of potable water will \nhave a marked positive impact on the health of the population. Water consumers will achieve a \nsignificant reduction in their medical expenses thereby freeing up income for the purchase of \nmore food. An indirect positive impact will be the improvement in nutrition and reduction of the \nincidence  of  anemia.  Adults  will  become  more  productive  and  able  to  participate  in \nincome-generating  activities.  School  absenteeism  will  decrease  as  children  will  become \nhealthier  and  will  not  be  required  to  spend  time  collecting  water.  The  extension  of  rural \nassemblies to local water management will provide the basis for involving future development \nprojects.  The  Project  will  also  help  to  decrease  the  out-migration  of  population  from \nKarakalpakstan and thereby assist in preserving local culture and customs. \n \n96.  Waterborne infectious diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid, and hepatitis A are common \nin the project area. Project beneficiaries will experience a rapid reduction in these infections \nwhen their household sanitation practices are improved, together with those at schools and \nhospitals. The provision of water will reduce exposure of the community to high levels of toxic \nsalts, which exist in groundwater that they currently drink. In the medium to longer term, the \nincidence of chronic diseases of the liver (hepatitis), gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys, and \nsome cancers, which are associated with decreased immunity linked to toxic salt levels, are \nexpected to decrease. The public health awareness program and improvement in sanitation \nfacilities at schools and hospitals will have a positive impact on rates of waterborne infections. \nThe provision of potable water in clinics will substantially improve their ability to wash patients \nand equipment with clean water. This benefit will be most felt by clinics that have no gas supply \nto boil water. \n \n2.  Gender and Development \n \n97.  Women are target beneficiaries of this Project since they are traditionally responsible for \ncollecting and managing drinking water, and health and hygiene in the home. Many of them are \nin poor health due to anemia and water-related diseases.34 The Project will relieve women of the \nburden of walking long distances and queuing for water collection, and thus free their time for \nrest  and  other  activities.  The  women  will  benefit  from  education  provided  by  the  Project, \nenabling them to realize their desire to improve the protection of their children from disease. \nWomen  will  also  be  involved  in  various  aspects  of  project  implementation,  i.e.,  water \nconservation, and public health awareness. This experience will strengthen their capacity to \ntake up future self-help projects as and when opportunities arise. \n \nD.  Impact on Poverty \n \n98.  Based on the socioeconomic survey and using the minimum wage criteria (para. 19 and \nfootnote 11), over 60 percent of the beneficiaries in the two districts are poor. The proportion of \npoor households is 80 percent in the sample district of Bozatau (Karakalpakstan) and 55 \n                                                 \n34 Official data show that 98 percent of women of reproductive age in Khorezm and 81.2 percent in Karakalpakstan \nare anemic. ", "  30   \npercent in Koshkupir (Khorezm). Water-related morbidity rates are high, and people often have \nto spend a large portion of their income or sell their assets to pay for medical treatment. The \nProject will improve water supply service to these poor rural communities. Increased access to \nwater services will result in improved living conditions and hygiene practices among the rural \npoor, thereby reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases and related medical expenses. In \nmost cases, significant cost savings from the use of alternative and distant water sources can \nbe used for income-generating activities. \n \n99.  The Project will benefit poor households by introducing a tariff structure that charges by \nvolume of water used and a lifeline tariff for low consumption households. This will guarantee \naccess to water services that are affordable to the rural poor. Beyond the lifeline consumption of \n10 m3 per month, a higher tariff will be charged to ensure water demand management and \nconservation by higher income users. \n \n100.  The Project will improve the quality of life of the beneficiaries through (i) access to safe \ndrinking water and better sanitation facilities; (ii) access to washing facilities; (iii) lower morbidity \nlevel from exposure to waterborne diseases; and (iv) less time spent on water collection, i.e., \nloss  of  productive  time.  Since  lower  income  households  are  more  vulnerable  to  service \ndeficiencies as coping mechanisms are unaffordable, they are more vulnerable to sickness. This \ncan lead to comparatively low school attendance and decreased ability to learn or to be involved \nin productive work. The Project will also create construction-related job opportunities for the \nunemployed skilled and unskilled laborers during the implementation stage. About 600 person-\nmonths of skilled employment and about 1,000 person-months of unskilled employment will be \ncreated by the Project. The results of the poverty impact assessment are in Appendix 15. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n101.  Six possible risks have been identified: (i) control of the flow in Amudarya River by \nriparian countries upstream of Uzbekistan; (ii) failure of raw water pumping and transmission \nsystems to deliver the necessary water to the distribution centers; (iii) lack of institutional \ncapacity, particularly at the local level, and experience in subproject selection and appraisal; (iv) \nlack of experience by the operating agencies, principally the agrovodokanals, to collect payment \nfrom individual consumers and by the individuals to recognize the need for and manage such \npayments; (v) lower than expected realization of subsidy or cost recovery jeopardizing service \nsustainability; and (vi) delay in project implementation due to unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. \nThe Government recognizes that agricultural projects in other regions must be sustainable and \nis developing facilities to support this policy.35 The Government is also working closely with \nneighboring countries to develop a coherent policy on water resource management that is \nendorsed by the subregional governments. International development agencies are supporting \nthis initiative. A subproject component will strengthen the capacity of delivery facilities to the \nTuyamuyon-Nukus system thus significantly improving the security of raw water supply. The risk \nof pump failure will be minimized by establishing good maintenance procedures and ensuring \npower  supply  from  alternative  sources.  The  issue  of  institutional  capability  in  subproject \nselection and appraisal has been dealt with by including the capacity building program, which \nincludes  project  management  support  to  assist  in  project  implementation.  Through  O&M \ntraining,  the  agrovodokanals  will  be  trained  to  ensure  their  effectiveness  in  project \nimplementation and O&M. The Government is committed under its current policy to subsidize \nthe  agrovodokanals,  in  particular  those  in  the  project  area,  to  ensure  sustainable  service \ndelivery to the rural population. The capacity building component will comprise training in (i) \n                                                 \n35 The Karshi Cascade Project in Kashkadarya province funded by the World Bank is an example. ADB will also be \nproviding assistance to the agriculture sector (footnote 18). ", "  31   \ntariff setting; (ii) tariff reviews; (iii) customer service training; and (iv) regular monitoring of \ncustomer satisfaction to improve service delivery, consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, and tariff \ncollection. Measures to reduce possible delays have been discussed with the Government. \nAgency responsibilities and appropriate mechanisms for coordination have been identified to \navoid the risk of delay in implementation. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n102.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funding. The Government will ensure that during each year of \nproject  implementation  adequate  funding,  including  budgetary  allocations,  of \ncounterpart funds will be made, and such funds will be released by the relevant \nauthorities on a timely and regular basis to facilitate project implementation by \npreparing and adopting, by 30 September of each year, an operation plan for the \nnext year. \n \n(ii)  PMU and PIU staff. The Government will ensure that the PMU and PIUs are \nalways adequately staffed with competent technical, accounting, and support \nstaff. \n \n(iii)  Subproject selection and review. The Government will follow the selection \ncriteria for subproject selection, and will seek ADB\u2019s approval for each of the first \ntwo subprojects from Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, all subprojects that cost over \n$200,000, and those having social and environmental issues prior to any contract \naward for that subproject. The Government will submit completion reports for the \nfirst 10 subprojects for ADB\u2019s review and comments. Selection of subprojects \ninvolving the Kaparas Reservoir facilities in Tuyamuyun complex requires a letter \nof  no-objection  from  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Turkmenistan  and \napproval from ADB. \n \n(iv)  Sanitary facilities and health awareness. The Government will ensure that \nwherever a piped water supply is provided under the Project, improvements to \nsanitation facilities and provision of hand-washing facilities at all kindergartens, \nschools and clinics, as well as health awareness programs will also be provided. \n \n(v)  Maintenance  of  project  facilities.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  project \nfacilities  are  properly  managed  by  the  concerned  local  governments, \nagrovodokanals, and rural assemblies through the collection of user charges and \nother local taxes; and provide subsidies when required.  \n \n(vi)  Cost recovery. The Government will ensure that (a) revenues from water tariffs \ncover O&M project cost as a first priority; and (b) full cost recovery of O&M and \npartial recovery of capital cost is achieved in a staged manner within a 10-year \nperiod after completion of the project facilities.  \n \n(vii)  Nonrevenue  water.  The  Government  will  establish  appropriate  monitoring \nsystems for nonrevenue water by 2003 to ensure the reduction of nonrevenue ", "  32   \nwater in the subproject districts so that by 2005 nonrevenue water will not exceed \n30 percent of the total water generated by each agrovodokanal in the subproject \ndistricts.  \n \n(viii)  Environment. The Government will ensure that (a) project implementation is \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  existing  environmental  laws,  regulations, \nstandards,  and  international  agreements  signed  by  Uzbekistan,  and  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines,  in  particular,  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and \nProcedures of ADB; (b) all monitoring and mitigation measures indicated in the \ninitial  environmental  examination  are  undertaken  for  the  Project;  (c)  project \nimplementation will include consultation with local communities on environmental \nissues, and the public will have access to environmental information pertaining to \nthe Project; (d) the existing capacity for carrying out monitoring of water and air \nemission will be maintained during the Project\u2019s life; (e) initial environmental \nexaminations and environmental impact assessments, where applicable, will be \ncarried out for the subprojects and submitted to ADB for review; and (f) any \nnegative environmental impact that may occur as a result of the implementation \nof any subproject will be mitigated.  \n \n(ix)  CBOs and NGOs. The Government will (a) facilitate involvement of CBOs and \nNGOs  concerned  in  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  O&M  of  the \nsubprojects; (b) actively assist with capacity building, such as in the health and \nhygiene components of the Project; and (c) ensure participation of women in \ncommunity  groups  in  project  implementation,  availability  of  adequate \nemployment opportunities for women by agrovodokanals in project activities, and \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  Development  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n(x)  Accounting  standards.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary \nmeasures are taken within one year from project commencement to allow the \nPMU and PIUs to apply international accounting standards (of the International \nAccounting Standards Committee or other internationally accepted standards) for \nthe purpose of this Project. \n \n(xi)  Audit.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  account  and  financial \nstatements are audited by an independent auditor in accordance with sound \naudit standards acceptable to ADB, and ensure that the auditor will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to \nADB. Loan funds may be used to finance expenditure for private sector auditors \nand translation of auditor\u2019s reports into English. \n \n(xii)  Project Performance Monitoring System. The PMU and the two PIUs will put \nin  place  project  performance  and  management  monitoring  and  evaluation \nindicators,  including  baseline  data  and  indicators  of  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental impacts of the Project upon the beneficiaries, within three months \nof loan effectiveness, and will submit project performance monitoring system \nreports  to  be  incorporated  in  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  project \ncompletion report to ADB. \n \n \n ", "  33   \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n103.  Prior to loan effectiveness:  \n \n(i)  the Government will have issued a decree specifying the project implementation \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  namely  (a)  the  respective  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  MMS,  the  governments  of \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm, and other relevant agencies in implementing the \nProject; and (b) flow of funds between such parties; and   \n \n(ii)  the PMU and PIUs will be established. \n \nC.  Condition for Disbursement \n \n104.  Except for mobilization payments for project consultants, loan disbursement will not take \nplace until the Government has fielded the project management consultants provided under the \nProject. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n105.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $38,000,000 to the Republic of \nUzbekistan for the Western Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility; an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n                TADAO CHINO       \n                  President \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 2002 \n \n \n \n ", "   34\nAPPENDIXES \n \nNumber  Title  Page  Cited on \n(page, para.) \n1  Project Framework \n35  1, 2 \n2  Institutional Structure \n38  4, 14 \n3  External Assistance to the Water Sector in the Drought \n40  9, 26 \nAreas of Uzbekistan \n4  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n43  16, 51 \n5  Project Implementation Structure \n44  18, 54 \n6  Subproject Selection Criteria and Process  \n46  19, 56 \n7  Implementation Schedule \n50  20, 61 \n8  Tentative Procurement Packages and Procurement Modes\n51  20, 62 \n9  Terms of Reference for Consulting Services for Project \n52  21, 63 \nManagement Support \n10  Summary Initial Environmental Examination \n55  25, 78 \n11  Social Analysis \n58  25, 81 \n12  Economic Analysis \n61  27, 88 \n13  Financial Analysis \n64  28, 91 \n14  Affordability Analysis \n68  28, 93 \n15  Poverty Impact Assessment \n70  30, 100 \n \nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES \n(available on request) \n \nA  Background on the Aral Sea Environmental Problems \nB  Existing Potable Water Supply in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm \nC  Subproject Design Criteria \nD  Summary Description of Sample Subprojects \nE  Initial Environmental Examination \nF  Detailed Economic Analysis \nG  Detailed Financial Analysis \nH  Project Performance Monitoring System \nI  Social Analysis \n ", "35 Appendix 1, page 1 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Project Targets and  Monitoring  Risks and \nMeasurable Indicators  Mechanism  Assumptions \nGoals       \n(cid:1)  Improve the living  (cid:1)  Sustain access to safe and  (cid:1)  Conduct  (cid:1)  Public sector \nand health  adequate water supply for  surveys at  agencies provide \nconditions of the  700,000 people, of which  midterm and  effective support. \npeople,  over 60 percent are  at project   \nparticularly the  classified as poor.  completion. \npoor, living in rural  (cid:1)  Reduce the incidence of \ncommunities in  waterborne diseases: \nKarakalpakstan  typhoid (from 90 percent), \nand Khorezm.  diarrhea (85 percent), and \nhepatitis A (80 percent). \nPurpose/Objectives       \n(cid:1)  Mitigate the  (cid:1)  Provide safe and  (cid:1)  Surveys at  (cid:1)  Infrastructure is \neffects of the  sustainable water supply  midterm and  properly managed, \nongoing drought  to at least 150 rural  project  operated, and \nby providing safe  settlements by 2005.  completion  maintained. \nand easily  (cid:1)  Improve water supply  (cid:1)  Project  (cid:1)  Communities \naccessible water  coverage in districts from  performance  participate  \nsupply, minimizing  about 12 percent minimum  report  effectively in project \nwater wastage,  to 85 percent by 2005.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  project  physical  components  for  water  supply  in  the  two  provinces  of \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  were  examined  against  the  criteria  specified  in  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The checklist of water project \nactions known to affect environmental resources and values was applied.  \n \n2.  The project implementation units (PIUs) to be set up under the Project and the utility \nagencies concerned will also conduct environmental screening during appraisal of the water \nsupply subprojects according to the laws of Uzbekistan. The law requires that an environmental \nimpact statement will be prepared starting at the time of the selection of the construction site, \nand with tasks continuing through the preparation of feasibility studies, implementation, and \nconstruction.  Where  appropriate,  an  initial  environmental  examination  and,  if  required,  an \nenvironmental impact assessment, will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Requirement and relevant local laws and procedures. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The project physical components comprise works as identified generally in Table A10.  \n \nTable A10: Physical Components \n \nWater Supply Component  Karakalpakstan  Khorezm \nBulk water pumping station  1  1 \nTransmission mains  56 km  16 km \nTrunk main \u2013 rehabilitation and new  34 km  50 km \nNew borehole  8  0 \nStorage reservoir  24  20 \nChlorine dosing facility  24  20 \nDesalination units  8  0 \nLocal booster pumping (stations)  24  20 \nReplace fragile/defective mains  100 km  140 km \nConstruction of new distribution mains  160 km  100 km \nSupply, district, consumer metering  TBA  TBA \nOperational plant and equipment  1  1 \nAsset management facilities  2  2 \nLaboratory testing  1  1 \n     \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n4.  Physical. Most of the project works will occur within the rural environment where low \ndensities  of  population  and  lack  of  formal  infrastructure  applies.  The  terrain  is  flat  and, \nparticularly  in  Karakalpakstan,  is  predominantly  desert.  Agriculture  is  wholly  dependent  on \nirrigation. The climate is hot and dry in summer, causing a significant increase in water use.  \n \n5.  The quality of abstracted raw water varies considerably according to the source and is \ntreated accordingly. Treated water is transmitted in buried pipelines, stored in closed reservoirs, \nthen  further  chlorinated  and  either  pumped  into  the  below-ground  distribution  network  or \ntransported by road tanker to delivery points.  \n \n   ", "    56 Appendix 10, page 2                          \n6.  Ecological. Years of intensive agricultural production, primarily cotton growing, has \ncaused serious, long-term ecological problems in Uzbekistan. Rivers are badly polluted by cattle \nbreeding, industrial effluent, and sewage, in addition to receiving surface runoff and leachate \nloaded with agrochemicals. These river waters require treatment prior to use for potable supply. \nShallow groundwater sources are also liable to contamination from surface activities and are not \nfavored as a potential source of water. Deep ground waters are generally free from pollution \nalthough heavily laden with mineral salts.  \n \n7.  Socioeconomic. The poor level of water availability and quality in the rural regions of \nthe  Aral  Sea  area  have  social  and  health  impacts.  Water-borne  diseases  are  prevalent \nthroughout  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  and  unemployment  exceeds  50  percent  of  the \nqualifying population. As a result, a large majority of the population are poor and unable to \nafford medical treatment or, in many cases, nutritious foods. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Project Location \n \n8.  The  proposed  work  is  in  low-density  rural  areas  without  well-developed  formal \ninfrastructure.  The  work  comprises  rehabilitation  of  existing  and  introduction  of  new  water \nsupply and distribution facilities. None of the water supply components will adversely affect \nnatural or cultural resources nor sensitive ecological zones, and no resettlement of residents is \nrequired by any of the activities.  \n \n2.  Design Aspects \n \n9.  The overall effect of the proposed works will be to improve the availability, quality, and \nefficiency of water service. Water resource options will include the review of available and \nsustainable sources.  Where applicable, boreholes will be drilled to deep aquifers that are \nproven to provide sufficient yield and of a quality that can be readily desalinated. The use of \nmetering and consumption-based billing will encourage conservation by users. Water quality will \nimprove as a result of improved filtering and chlorination, and by replacing leaky distribution \nnetworks  to  reduce  infiltration  by  groundwater.  Improvement  of  testing  laboratories  in  the \nagrovodokanals (rural water supply agencies) will improve their capacity to monitor the quality of \nraw water and water supplied to the distribution network.  \n \n10.  Chlorine-dosing facilities will be designed and constructed to comply with state planning \nand construction standards.   \n \n3.  Construction \n \n11.  The construction of pipe networks is likely to cause minor, temporary impacts such as \ntraffic  disruption,  and  potential  for  erosion  (silt  runoff)  at  excavation  and  trenching  sites. \nHowever these are routine problems that can be mitigated by construction management.   \n \n4.  Operations Stage \n \n12.  Improved efficiencies in all phases of service provision, combined with tariff reforms, will \nimprove the willingness to pay and, in the longer term, enable the generation of revenues to \nsustain the service at the improved levels. Where new equipment is installed, training on \noperation and maintenance will be provided. \n   ", "    57 Appendix 10, page 3                          \n5.  Environmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirements \n \n13.  Each of the utility agencies concerned will be required to assess environmental impacts \nof the project physical work, and to prepare the statements of environmental impacts and \nconsequences required by law in Uzbekistan. The works proposed are similar to other works \nconducted  by  the  respective  utility  agencies  although  training  will  be  needed  (and  will  be \nprovided  under  the  Project),  for  them  to  prepare  the  required  environmental  impact \nassessments.  \n \n14.  Once the components are operational, the utility agencies will need to monitor water \nquality according to existing laws and regulations. A monitoring plan will be set up at the \ncommencement of the Project and will specify the frequency, methods, quality standards, and \nprocedures and actions to be followed as a result of noncompliance. This monitoring is currently \nundertaken by the Sanitary Epidemeological Survey, part of the Ministry of Health on their \nbehalf,  but  this  arrangement  should  prove  unnecessary  after  completion  of  the  Project. \nOperational safety will be improved under the Project and a designated safety officer will be \nincluded in training provided to operators of equipment under the Project. The safety officer will \nmonitor and arrange the necessary mitigation of hazardous working conditions. \n \n6.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n15.  None of the Project\u2019s physical components will cause significant environmental impacts \nbased on the screening of possible environmental consequences using ADB checklists. The \nwater supply project components will improve the access to safe water, but will not cause any \nsignificant depletion of resource in the process. Improved supply networks will reduce losses \nand  waste.  Improvements  to  sanitation  and  hygiene  will  reduce  the  incidence  and \nsocioeconomic costs of illness.  \n \n16.  The PIUs should each designate one staff member as responsible for (i) assuring that \ntender and contract documents contain binding provisions to prevent and mitigate adverse \nenvironmental  impacts;  (ii)  assuring  that  the  implementing  utility  agencies  comply  with \nGovernment environmental impact regulations and standards; and (iii) monitoring and reporting \non impacts and compliance with the adopted environmental protection measures.  \n \nE.  Conclusion \n \n17.  The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact, but will result in \nnumerous  environmental  improvements.  A  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not \nconsidered necessary. \n \n \n   ", "    58           Appendix 11, page1   \n \nSOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Report Outline \n \n1.  This  report  provides  a  profile  of  the  key  characteristics  of  residents  in  the  sample \nsubproject districts, including their perceived needs, and evaluates the likely impact of the \nProject  on  them  including  their  ability  to  access  project  benefits.  The  report  is  based  on \nresearch consisting of a random statistical survey of 200 households in each of two subproject \ndistricts (Bozatau in Karakalpakstan and Koshkupir in Khorezm) and focus groups, separately \nfor  women  and  men,  convened  in  each  district.1  The  participants  represented  low-income \npeople living in rural settlements within these districts. Meetings were also held with local \ngovernment officials and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) active within the districts \n \nB.  Background \n \n2.  The project districts are located within Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, which have been \nfacing  water  shortage  problems  further  intensified  by  the  ongoing  drought.  The  traditional \nsources  of  income  from  agriculture  and  fishing  have  all  but  ceased,  and  the  majority  of \nhouseholds rely on social assistance. The basic human need for safe drinking water is not being \nmet. Water availability from wells is inadequate and of poor quality, polluted with fecal bacteria \nand high salt levels. Consequently the level of morbidity is high, and women and children are \nforced to travel long distances to fetch water. \n \nC.  Profile of Project Beneficiaries \n \n3.  The  household  monthly  income  in  Bozatau  ranges  from  SUM6,900  to  SUM15,900. \nCorresponding  figures  for  Koshkupir  are  SUM7,600  and  SUM18,900.  The  majority  of \nhouseholds  have  between  3  and  8  members.  Monthly  per  capita  income  was  lowest  in \nhouseholds above 9 members (e.g., less than SUM2,000 in Bozatau for households with 9\u201312 \npersons). Large households of 12 persons or more comprise 10 percent of the total. Mean \nmonthly household expenditure on health is a major expense and comprises about SUM6,000 \nin Bozatau and SUM9,000 in Koshkupir. Per capita daily food consumption is extremely low: in \nBozatau the mean calorie intake is 1,996 and 2,335 in Koshkupir. \n \nD.  Role of Women \n \n4.  Women in the project area are traditionally responsible for collecting water used for \ndrinking, cooking, childcare, and cleaning. The traditional male occupations of crop cultivation \nand livestock rearing have significantly declined due to the prevailing ecological conditions. In \nmany households women are now the main wage earners, working in low paid service jobs \nsuch as cleaning.  \n \nE.  Water Sources and Availability \n \n5.  In some rural areas (27 percent in Koshkupir and 54 percent of Bozatau) households are \nsupplied by the agrovodokanals (rural water supply agencies); while the service is very often \n                                                 \n1 The socioeconomic survey and focus group discussions were carried out during February 2002 under TA 3828-\nUZB: Aral Sea Area Drought Relief Project, for $150,000, approved on 3 January 2002. The two districts are typical \nfor rural Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. \n   ", "    59           Appendix 11, page2   \n \nscheduled,2 in some cases the connection has completely failed. The majority of the rural \npopulation  rely  on  water  from  shallow  wells  (70  percent  of  Bozatau  and  92  percent  of \nKoshkupir), which is limited, seasonally irregular, and of extreme poor quality. \n \n6.  In Koshkupir, people with water pipes and intermittent supplies are able to grow fruit and \nvegetables in their garden plots. However poor water quality affects production. When water is \nnot available nearby, or when the quality is very poor, people travel longer distances, often more \nthan 2 kilometers to find water. A few households have paid for private boreholes and supply \nwater to neighbors. People in Koshkupir are sometimes able to obtain water from irrigation \nchannels and cooling water from the electricity plant. Like well water, the irrigation water needs \nto be boiled and the industrial water contains toxic chemicals. Sometimes households have no \nwater for days. Coping mechanisms include borrowing water from neighbors. Since the onset of \nthe drought, people have to pay for such water. In some cases, people have to sell milk \n(normally for personal consumption) from the cow to buy water. In Bozatau, since they have no \ncash, they borrow and repay neighbors in water. \n \nF.  Sanitation and Health \n \n7.  Community awareness, motivation, and standards on sanitary practices are very low and \nmodes of transmission of waterborne diseases are little known. Latrines, where available, are \ninadequately constructed. Many schools, especially in Bozatau, are without water pipes or wells, \nand are unable to provide hand-washing facilities for pupils. In Bozatau, people have little \nsurplus water left for cleaning. Expenditure on sanitation takes low priority. The exception is \namong women in Koshkupir who want to improve their latrines. Teachers interviewed in the \nsubproject districts are aware of the health risks but have no budget to improve facilities. Some \nprovide their own labor to dig new school latrines. Drinking water is boiled in the schools but it is \nsalty and the availability is often inadequate. \n \n8.  People associate the high salt levels in their water with kidney disease but do not \nassociate  infectious  diseases  with  unboiled  water.  Expenditure  on  medical  treatment  is \nextremely high and is the predominant reason for having to relinquish assets. When people \nhave no money to pay for treatment they attempt to borrow from family or from neighbors. When \nthis is not possible they sell their assets such as the cow. The household cow is often the main \nasset and cow milk is a more important income source than crops. Watering the cow takes \npriority over washing.  People become extremely vulnerable if they have no cow and are then \nunable to obtain medical treatment. This may partly explain the low levels of disease recorded in \nofficial statistics. \n \nG.  Perceived Needs and Demands \n  \n9.  The research reveals differing socioeconomic conditions across the study areas. In \nKoshkupir, salty water is usually available from the wells and hand pumps. Men\u2019s concern is \ntherefore to maintain their ability to irrigate and to desalinate the water to increase crop yield. \nThe women are mainly concerned about water quality. At the other extreme, in Bozatau, water \nof any quality is very scarce so people are concerned about supply as well as quality. Feeding \nthe cow takes equal priority since it provides income to buy food.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   Scheduled supplies are often restricted to one hour in morning and one hour in afternoon. \n   ", "    60           Appendix 11, page3   \n \nH.  Willingness to Pay \n \n10.  Willingness to pay for drinking water in the sample districts is linked to perceptions about \nthe future viability of crop production and whether water supply is available through pipes \nnearby. Men\u2019s willingness to pay is particularly sensitive to these conditions since in Koshkupir \nthey  are  responsible  for  crop  production  to  generate  income,  as  well  as  for  household \nconsumption. Shallow wells in Koshkupir still have adequate water although its quality is very \npoor. Households with pipes do not support metering since they are concerned that water for \nirrigation will also be charged. However other households support metering. All the focus groups \nare against shared metering because they feel that there will be an abuse of water use. \nRespondents are initially skeptical about paying for water because they are concerned about \naffordability. However, when savings on health care and project financing are explained, most \nagree that they should pay a token amount related to consumption level. \n \nI.  Affordability \n \n11.  Affordability is relatively low and the conventional measure of 5 percent of household \nincome is too high since other basic human needs are not currently being met. People subsist \non milky tea, bread, and pasta. Many cannot afford medical treatment and often cannot afford \nsoap. Focus groups report children missing school due to inadequate winter clothing. Cash \nincome is low since utility bills are being deducted at source from allowances and pensions. The \nproposed tariff takes this into consideration to establish charges based on level of consumption, \nincluding a lifeline tariff for the lowest income group. Overall people will be charged about 3 \npercent of household income. It is also proposed that community based organizations (CBOs) \nallocate water credits and coupons to subsidize poor consumers. \n \nJ.  Community Structure and Absorptive Capacity \n \n12.  Rural communities in the sample subproject districts have well-organized CBOs. These \ntake the form of formal rural assemblies and their constituent neighborhood organizations. The \ndistrict governments maintain good contact with them and also retain women\u2019s committees. \nNGOs are active in Karakalpakstan with over 160 NGOs of which at least 70 are active. In \nKhorezm, 43 are registered. The strong social support structure in rural areas is likely to ensure \nthat  all  households  will  receive  equitable  amounts  of  drinking  water  provided  sufficient \ninfrastructure is available for water delivery within reasonable distances. Settlement patterns are \nscattered and a piped supply will not always be cost effective. CBOs will be consulted on water \ndelivery to areas that may not have pipes. Consumers are prepared to assist in laying pipe and \nin transporting water to distribution points.  \n \nK.  Social Impact of the Project \n \n13.  The mitigation of the Aral Sea environmental problems will not be achieved quickly, and \nthe  rapidly  deteriorating  socioeconomic  and  health  situation  requires  emergency  aid.  The \ndrinking water project and associated health awareness component will partially reduce poverty \nin that people will have reduced exposure to disease and will therefore spend less on medical \ntreatment. This will release their meager resources to buy more nutritious food and help to \nreduce the very high levels of anemia among women in reproductive age groups and improve \nperinatal  health.  School-age  children  will  become  healthier  and  have  increased  learning \ncapacity.    The  proposed  Project  will  bring  significant  positive  social  impact  to  the  target \nbeneficiaries. \n \n   ", "   61             Appendix 12, page 1  \n \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Methodology and Approach \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  is  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) guidelines, including Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, and Handbook for \nthe Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The analysis describes the economic rationale \nand target beneficiaries, sets out the without-project situation, and undertakes an analysis of \nalternatives. The analysis compares the calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for \nthe  sample  subprojects1  with  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  which  is \nassumed to be 12 percent.2  Standard and project-specific sensitivity tests are undertaken to \nassess the robustness of the EIRR calculation. The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, \nas benefits are nontradable in nature. The analysis is undertaken in constant 2002 prices. \n \nB.  Economic Rationale and Without-Project Situation \n \n2.  The water supply components will (i) generate major efficiency gains, reducing network \nleakage and pumping energy costs by over 20 percent; (ii) improve cost recovery through better \nuser satisfaction with service delivery; (iii) improve access to safe water for the nonconnected \nhouseholds; (iv) reduce natural resource depletion; (iv) improve public health by reducing the \nincidence of waterborne disease; and (v) support economic recovery. Unaccounted for water \nwill be reduced from in excess of 50 percent, to a target of 30 percent over the Project\u2019s life.  \n \n3.  Rural  water  supply  services  in  the  project  districts  are  inadequate.3  Assets  have \ndeteriorated and lack of proper maintenance is such that water supply in the two subproject \ndistricts  is  severely  compromised.  Without  urgent  major  investment  in  production  and  the \ndistribution network, the agrovodokanals\u2019 (rural water supply agency) water supply systems will \ncontinue to deteriorate rapidly, with serious economic and environmental consequences. Water \nshortages and pressure problems limit the actual supply to between 30 and 60 percent of those \nconnected in Bozatau and Koshkupir respectively, and without urgent investment the systems \nare expected to fail completely within 10 years. The Project is considered high priority by the \nGovernment, is timely, and is well integrated with other investment activities in these two \nregions to pursue the long-term objective of providing sufficient and secure water supply to the \nrural population. Improved efforts on cost recovery and operation and maintenance (O&M) will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  willingness-to-pay,  sustainability  of  services,  and  potable  water \nresource management. \n \nC.  Project Description and Beneficiaries \n \n4.  The Project focuses on the secure and sustainable supply of good quality potable water \nto rural communities within the districts of the two provinces.  The physical works will generally \ncomprise trunk mains, pumping stations, boreholes and desalination plants, reservoirs with \nchlorination equipment, and local distribution networks that will include metering. The Project \nwill  also  provide  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  to  agrovodokanals,4  health \nawareness education to the population, and improvements to sanitation at schools and clinics. \nThe Project will benefit about 700,000 customers, as well as small businesses, and educational \n                                                 \n1  The sample subproject districts are Bozatau in Karakalpakstan and Koshkupir in Khorezm.  \n2   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n3  Service coverage levels are low, 27 percent and 54 percent of rural population in Koshkupir and Bozatau, \nrespectively, and service levels are low with two to four hours intermittent supply. The rest of the population obtain \nwater from hand pumps, boreholes, and canals, which are distant, saline, and contaminated in most cases. \n4  The World Bank-funded Water Supply and Sanitation Project has initiated institutional reforms among vodokanals \n(urban water supply agencies). These include tariff restructuring measures in pilot districts where water metering \nhas been installed. ", "   62             Appendix 12, page 2  \n \nand medical institutions.  Access to a clean, safe, and reliable water supply system will be of \nparticular benefit to the rural poor.  Community-based consumer committees will also be set up \nin  each  district  to  help  the  agrovodokanal  develop  a  more  customer-oriented  service  and \nimprove customer satisfaction. Specific service delivery targets for water supply and water \nquality have been agreed with the Government. \n \nD.  Analysis of Alternatives   \n \n5.  An  analysis  of  technical  alternatives  was  undertaken  based  on  items  that  were \nconsidered  essential  for  establishing  a  sustainable  water  supply  system.  In  Koshkupir,  no \ngroundwater sources are suitable, and hence potable water should be from the Tuyamuyun \ntrunk main system only. In Bozatau, a number of potential options are available, including \nshallow groundwater lenses, deep aquifers, and where practical, connection to the Tuyamuyun \nsupply.  However,  shallow  lenses  are  not  necessarily  reliable  and  deep  aquifer  resources \ndepend upon desalination before the water is of a potable standard. The choice of single option \nor a combination of options will therefore depend on (i) physical feasibility, (ii) unit cost of supply \nbased on incremental investment and O&M costs, and (iii) sustainability of resource.  The \nconsideration of alternative sources was strengthened by the choice of the most cost-effective \nrehabilitation of the distribution system and construction of new water distribution centers.  \n \nE.  Economic Costs \n \n6.  Economic costs exclude taxes, and financial prices are converted to economic prices \nusing conversion factors. The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) was assumed to be 1.4 \nbased on the existing relationship between the commercial rate and the official rate.5 Since the \nSERF is a key input into the analysis, tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of the \nProject to changes in the SERF. The conversion factor for labor was assumed to be 0.8, since \nthere  is  excess  employment  in  communal  services  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  staff. \nConsiderable savings are made in operational costs under the Project, due to efficiency gains, \nbut these savings are reduced due to projected increases in O&M expenditure due to increased \nproduction and distribution capacity. The incremental economic costs are phased over the \nProject\u2019s planning period, assumed to be 20 years, after completion.  \n \nF.  Economic Benefits \n \n7.  For water supply components, the major economic benefits comprise (i) cost savings on \nthe nonincremental supply to connected and nonconnected households; and (ii) willingness-to-\npay  based  on  average  demand  price  for  incremental  water  supplies.  For  connected  and \nnonconnected households, the nonincremental benefits are quantified using the resource cost \nsavings approach for (i) use of alternative water sources; (ii) time savings for water collection; \n(iii)  nontechnical  losses;6  and  (iv)  savings  in  health  expenditure.7  Incremental  benefits  are \nvalued using (i) willingness to pay. Values for potable water consumption are based on the cost \nof potable water for a minimum drinking requirement but only for the highest 10 percent income \ngroup among the nonconnected households.8 Time savings for water collection and willingness \nto pay are based on the social survey. Health benefits are calculated based on the avoided \n                                                 \n5  The SERF was estimated at 1.4 based on the prevailing official rate and the commercial rate as of February 2002. \nSensitivity analysis assumed the SERF to be 2.1 based on the market rate. \n6  Nontechnical losses add to the welfare of population served and estimated to be 20 liters per capita per day for \nBozatau and  10 in Koshkupir. (ADB. 1999. Handbook for Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. p. \n65). \n7  Incidence of waterborne diseases is caused by (1) high salinity levels of water from boreholes and river canals \nparticularly in Karakalpakstan, and (2) water contamination due to corroded conditions of pipes and lack of proper \nstructure for existing hand pumps and boreholes.  \n8  Potable water is purchased from other districts by households on regular scheduled bus trips. ", "   63             Appendix 12, page 3  \n \ntreatment costs, using official health statistics on the impact of water supply improvements on \nthe  incidence  of  the  three  most  common  waterborne  diseases  and  the  cost  of  medical \ntreatment, including supplies from local hospitals. \n \nG.  Results \n \n8.  In the two sample subproject districts, the EIRRs exceed the EOCC, which is assumed \nto be 12 percent. Sensitivity analysis, conducted for a 10 percent increase in capital and \noperating costs, and 10 percent reduction in subproject benefits, is summarized in Table A12. \nAnother standard sensitivity scenario assumes a one-year delay in benefits. Even at the worst \ncase scenario, which combines a 10 percent decrease in benefits and 10 percent increase in \ncosts, the subprojects are still feasible with EIRRs above 12 percent.  The resulting EIRRs are \nrobust and subprojects are economically viable even in the combined worst case scenario.  \nSwitching values and sensitivity indicators are also calculated. The results indicate that the \nEIRRs of subprojects are most sensitive to a decline in project benefits.  \n \n9.  Two additional project-specific sensitivity tests were undertaken: (i) increases in the \nvalue of the SERF to reflect the difference between the current market exchange rate and the \nofficial rate; and (ii) capital and O&M costs increase by 40 percent. The EIRRs in both districts \nexceed the EOCC of 12 percent. The results show that the SERF will have to increase by about \n30 percent for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC. The second sensitivity test assumes that the \ncapital  and  incremental  O&M  costs  will  increase  by  40  percent  considering  the  possible \nconstruction delays and relatively lower operational efficiencies. Again, the EIRRs remain above \nthe EOCC.

Conclusion \n \n10.  The project components are economically viable and are robust to adverse cost and \nbenefit scenarios. The calculated EIRRs are expected to be lower than the true EIRR since the \neconomic, social, and environmental implications of not undertaking the Project are severe and \nworsen rural poverty in the project area.  ", "64 Appendix 13, page 1 \n \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction, Background, and Scope \n \n1.  The financial analysis is undertaken in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nguidelines, including the Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. \n \n2.  The agrovodokanals (rural water supply agencies) in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm are \nresponsible for rural water supply and sanitation in the provincial districts.1 Government policy \nfor agrovodokanals currently allows provision of subsidy for capital and operating requirements, \nalthough  it  is  simultaneously  promoting  market  principles  in  the  provision  of  communal \nservices.2  However, the current financial situation of the agrovodokanals is poor, mainly due to \n(i) low tariffs, (ii) unaccounted-for-water of about 50 percent,3 (iii) low revenue collection rates, \n(iv) rising costs, and (v) cash-flow problems. The Project seeks to reverse the downward spiral \nof  poor  service  delivery,  low  efficiency  in  tariff  collection,  underfunding,  and  aging  and \ndeteriorating assets to enable agrovodokanals to become self-financing and sustainable in the \nlong term. \n \n3.  A financial analysis was undertaken of the two sample subproject districts of Bozatau in \nKarakalpakstan and Koshkupir in Khorezm. The analysis calculates tariffs required for operation \nand maintenance (O&M) and capital cost recovery, undertakes a financial appraisal of project \ncomponents in each district, and provides financial projections for the two agrovodokanals at the \ndistrict level. However, due to the limited customer base of agrovodokanals and the poor \neconomic conditions, a more realistic approach is for tariff recovery to fund O&M only. The \nGovernment will need to continue with its current policy of subsidizing both the capital and some \noperating  requirements  of  agrovodokanals  to  sustain  the  improved  levels  of  service.  This \nsubsidy will include the indirect subsidy provided by the discounted rate charged for bulk water \nsupplied from the Tuyamuyun source.4 Nevertheless the agrovodokanals must comply with \noperating and financial efficiency requirements in the medium term. This will enhance their \nrevenue generating capacity and encourage them to practice better water demand management \npractices. \n \nB.  Tariff Setting and Cost Recovery  \n \n4.  Calculated full cost recovery tariffs are calibrated against the affordability of the rural \npoor,  which  dictates  the  required  level  of  long-term  capital  and  operating  subsidies.  Tariff \nestimates are based on the proposals to introduce metered volume charging by 2006.5 Tariffs \n                                                 \n1 In Karakalpakstan, the agrovodokanal operations are centralized and cover all 15 districts. In Khorezm, a \ndecentralized management of rural water supply exists, with each of the 11 districts having staff responsible for \nproviding the district\u2019s water supply requirements.  \n2  Resolution No. 243 allows for full recovery of operation and maintenance costs as a minimum requirement without \nexcluding the option to charge higher tariff to cover part of the capital cost. This policy will be implemented over a \nnumber of years. However, achieving full cost recovery for services to the rural communities that are suffering from \neconomic hardships as a consequence of the drought will be difficult.  \n3  Unaccounted for water estimate is based on the Demand Management and Loss Reduction Study conducted by \nthe Ministry of Macroeconomic and Statistics in August 2000. \n4  Interregional trunk main supplies based on raw water abstraction from the Amudarya River at Tuyamuyun. \n5  The Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau-financed rural water project indicated that in 2000, a realistic tariff (assuming \nthe rural water supply systems are functioning well) would be in the range of SUM200 per month per household, \nplus inflation.  \n   ", "65 Appendix 13, page 2 \n \nwill cover O&M expenditure in a phased manner, but will not cover interest on the ADB loan.6 \nO&M cost estimates are based on improvements in efficiency of operation, particularly in the \nvolume of water produced and effective maintenance requirements.  Water demand is based on \nthe estimated daily consumption for domestic use only, although in Karakalpakstan, this does \ninclude an allowance for cattle. Unaccounted for water is assumed to reduce from a current 50 \npercent to 30 percent as a result of project works. Resulting from the improved service delivery, \nthe tariff collection rate is assumed to be 60 percent in the early years after project completion, \nrising to 75 percent by 2010.  \n \n5.  The proposed average tariffs per cubic meter in 2006 (in constant prices) are SUM30 in \nBozatau  and  SUM40  in  Koshkupir  (equivalent  to  about  $0.043  and  $0.057  at  the  official \nexchange rate).7 Since existing tariffs are based on normative consumption, comparing existing \nand proposed tariffs is difficult. However, comparisons of existing and proposed household \ncharges are shown in the affordability analysis.  Required tariff levels are sensitive to changes in \nproduction, consumption, losses, tariff collection rates, actual costs, and inflation among other \nfactors, and hence tariff reviews must take place regularly, and appropriate tariffs implemented, \nboth during project construction and beyond 2006.  \n \nC.  Financial Appraisal  \n \n6.  Project financial appraisal for each district, compares the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)8  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.1  percent.9    Sensitivity  tests  are \nundertaken to assess the impact on the FIRR of cost increases, revenue decreases, and \ncurrency  depreciation.  Switching  values  and  sensitivity  indicators  are  also  calculated.  The \nappraisal is undertaken in 2002 prices. Project capital expenditure is estimated based on the \nimplementation  schedule  and  includes  physical  contingencies  of  10  percent  for  all  items. \nReplacement costs are included for all operating equipment being needed 15 years after project \ncompletion. O&M costs include only the incremental costs incurred under the Project.  \n \n7.  Revenues  are  estimated  based  on  the  required  average  tariff,  predicted  water \nconsumption, and a collection rate of 60 percent. Tariffs are assumed to stay constant in real \nterms after 2006, but revenues increase along with increases in water consumption. The FIRRs \nare 3.9 percent in Bozatau and 5.1 percent in Koshkupir. These reflect the required Government \nsubsidy for the capital and operating requirements. With Government subsidies plus direct \nrevenues, incomes exceed the weighted average cost of capital of 2.1 percent, demonstrating \nthat at proposed, affordable tariff levels the Project can be financially viable (Table A13.1). The \noverall FIRR is 4.6 percent.  \n \n8.  Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken on key assumptions in the analysis. The \nresults indicate the Project is most sensitive to a decline in water sales or tariff collection, and a \nfurther test was undertaken for a 15 percent decrease in revenue. Even so, the Project was \n                                                 \n6  The ADB loan which covers part of the capital works will be paid by the Government and the agrovodokanals will \nnot assume any liability related thereto but will be responsible to ensure that the capital assets of the Project are \ngiven proper and adequate maintenance. \n7  In 2001, the average tariff levels in Bozatau and Koshkupir for domestic users were SUM14.7 and SUM22.7 \nrespectively.   \n8  The FIRR calculation uses project capital costs and additional O&M costs associated with the Project. \n9  The WACC is calculated based on the cost of borrowing from ADB and counterpart funds. The cost of ADB funds \nare calculated at 2.5 percent of the foreign cost component and discounted at international inflation of 2.4 percent. \nThe cost of counterpart funds is assumed to be 5 percent over the rate of inflation in line with Government rates for \nlong-term lending.   \n   ", "66 Appendix 13, page 3 \n \nfound  to  be  financially  viable  under  all  the  adverse  cost  and  revenue  scenarios.

Financial Projections  \n \n9.  Detailed financial projections up to 2025 have been prepared for the agrovodokanals10 in \nBozatau and Koshkupir. The projected financial statements are in current prices that include \ninflation  in  each  year.11  For  purposes  of  analysis,  project  assets  are  valued  using  the \ncommercial exchange rate and are assumed to accumulate as work in progress in line with the \nimplementation schedule. The opening balance is based on balance sheets provided by the \nagrovodakanals for 2001.12 Fixed project assets are depreciated at a rate of 2.5 percent per \nannum for pipe networks, 10 percent for meters, and 5.0 percent for other assets, on a declining \nbalance. Accounts payable represent 10 percent of operating expenses. Seventy percent of \nnonoperational revenue is assumed to be zero. \n \n10.  The value-added tax is calculated at an average of 20 percent on actual income. The \ncollection rate is assumed to be 60 percent rising to 75 percent after project completion.  \nRevenue for the years up to 2006 is based on actual current income, increasing at an annual \nrate of about 15 percent.  Although tariffs are assumed to increase over the construction period, \n                                                 \n10 The financial data for Bozatau and Koshkupir water supply operations have been estimated based on actual 1999-\n2001 operational data from Karakalpakstan and Khorezm agrovodokanals.   \n11 International inflation is assumed to be 2.4 percent per annum. Domestic inflation is assumed to be 24 percent for \n2002 to 2005, 20 percent from 2006 to 2010, and 15 percent thereafter.  \n12 Revaluation of fixed assets was undertaken by agrovodokanals in 2001 as per legislation.  \n \n   ", "67 Appendix 13, page 4 \n \nsignificant improvement in collection rates are not expected to occur until three years after \nproject implementation when benefits have been experienced. \n \n11.  In the years to 2006, because of inadequate actual income, the agrovodokanals are \nexpected to continue to experience cash-flow problems, given inadequate service provision and \ninability to charge for a service if none is provided.  Since revenue is dependent on tariff \ncollection, the actual operating service requirement is critical to the financial sustainability of the \nagrovodokanal  and  the  Project  must,  therefore,  focus  on  service  delivery.  Agrovodokanal \nexpenditure is expected to remain constant in real terms until 2006 but thereafter fixed and \nvariable costs for water are calculated based on production volumes. From 2006, a moderate \nprofit should occur with improved financial ratios. The Government has agreed that O&M costs \nwill receive priority, and only when they have been met will any remaining revenue by released \nfor capital and loan repayments.  \n \n12.  On the data available and assumptions as described, the agrovodokanals are shown to \nbe able to cover O&M expenses in about 10 years, with income covering realistic and adequate \nrequirements for maintenance and repair. Under these conditions, the agrovodokanals appear \nto be sustainable in the long term. Summary ratios are shown in Table A13.2.

Introduction \n \n1.  An affordability analysis was undertaken to assess whether the Project is affordable to \nlower income rural households, based on estimated tariffs and household income data from the \nsocial research.1 In line with Asian Development Bank (ADB) practice, tariffs are considered to \nbe affordable if they fall below 5 percent of monthly household income. Since metered charging \nwill be introduced under the Project, a tariff structure was prepared for each district using a \nstepped tariff by volume and lifeline tariff for minimum consumption of 10 cubic meters per \nhousehold per month to increase affordability of the rural poor. \n \nB.  Tariff Structure and Affordability \n \n2.  Proposed  average  tariffs  are  calculated  using  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery  of \noperation and maintenance (O&M). However, since affordability of tariffs is a critical issue in the \ndrought-stricken areas in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, the Government has committed to \ncontinue subsidizing rural water supply until the agrovodokanals can fully recover the cost of \nO&M from users.  In addition, once meters are installed under the Project, charging rural \ncustomers  by  volume  but  stepping  tariffs  according  to  actual  water  consumption  is \nrecommended.2 This will encourage demand management and appropriate water use, and \nreduce wastage. Setting a low tariff for low consumption is termed a \u201clifeline\u201d tariff as it assists \nthose with low income to have a subsistence consumption of water at affordable price.  \n \n3.  The tariff structure includes for residential customers: a lifeline tariff set at 60 liters per \ncapita per day (lcd), a tariff for consumption between 61 lcd and 75 lcd, and a higher tariff for \nconsumption over 75 lcd. The objectives of volume tariff structuring are to guarantee access of \nlower income households to  piped water and to encourage efficient water use by higher income \nconsuming households, and thus, ensure reduction of water loss from leaks and wasteful use. \n \n4.  A  detailed  comparison  of  existing  and  proposed  charges  for  domestic  water \nconsumption levels in the two sample subproject districts of Bozatau in Karakalpakstan and \nKoshkipur in Khorezm is shown in Table A14. The proportion of these charges to household \nincomes is also shown. The household charge for average water consumption satisfies ADB \ncriteria since it accounts for a maximum of less than 5 percent of average household income. \nFor those with the lowest incomes, the water charge is lower than 5 percent of income if water \nconsumption is limited to around the lifeline consumption level. The social research showed that \nabout 73 percent of respondents in Bozatau and about 85 percent in Koshkupir were willing to \npay for water supply improvements. Of those respondents who were willing to pay, the average \nwas about SUM280 in Bozatau and SUM320 in Koshkupir per household per month. Proposed \nhousehold charges are in line with these levels.  \n \n5.  Proposed water tariffs per cubic meter are in the range of SUM20 for Bozatau and \nSUM25 for Koshkupir. These levels represent a reasonable increase compared with the current \ntariffs  of  SUM10  for  Bozatau  and  SUM18  for  Koshkupir,  since  current  tariffs  have  been \nincreased to take account of inflation. The analysis shows keeping tariffs at about 3 percent of \nhousehold income, this means that required tariff increases remain affordable in Bozatau and \nKoshkupir.  \n                                                 \n1 Social research included social surveys, field visits, and focus groups discussions in the sample subproject        \ndistricts. \n2 The World Bank Water Supply project has been undertaking metering of household consumption in the district \ncenters.  A  detailed  stepped  tariff  structure  based  on  size  of  meters  installed  has  been  proposed  to  the \nGovernment. Once metered volumes become available, the demand information will be used to assist in designing \nan appropriate tariff structures in the project areas.

Poverty Measures  \n \n1.  Uzbekistan has no agreed or reliable measure of poverty and no official poverty line. The \naverage per capita monthly income in 2001 was estimated at SUM9,710.1 The Government \nuses the concept of \u201cleast provided families\u201d to identify those needing support for basic human \nneeds. The main indicator is income per family member, including additional criteria of asset \nownership. In Government terms, the poor are classified as a vulnerable and low-income group \nbased on the prevailing official minimum wage, which is adjusted regularly for inflation, and in \nJanuary  2002  was  set  at  SUM3,430  per  month.2  In  a  recent  study  by  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit, Tacis, and the World Bank, minimum wage was used to assess \nthe poverty level in Tashkent, Ferghana, and Karakalpakstan. Based on the minimum wage \ncriteria, urban poverty in these areas was estimated at 10, 28, and 50 percent, respectively. \nRural poverty is expected to be higher. In the same survey, self-ranked poverty (i.e., not having \nenough money for food and medicines) in these areas ranged from 30 to 70 percent of the \npopulation depending on the location. Using the World Bank definition of poverty of $1 per day, \neven at the official exchange rate, would put the average income in Uzbekistan at approximately \ntwo thirds of the $1 a day level. This indicates that the majority of the population in the country is \npoor.    \n \nB.  Income in the Project Area \n \n2.  Income and expenditure data for 2000 and 2001 show that the average per capita \nannual money income was SUM116,520 and expenditure was SUM102,600, an equivalent of \nSUM9,710 and SUM8,550 per month. However, the national average hides wide variations \nbetween  Tashkent  City  and  other  provinces,  particularly  the  poorer  regions  such  as \nKarakalpakstan, where income and expenditure levels are much lower. About 80 percent of the \npopulation in Karakalpakstan and 60 percent in Khorezm were unemployed in 2001. The annual \nper capita income in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm in 2001 was estimated at SUM54,430 and \nSUM63,770 respectively. Based on the socioeconomic survey undertaken in February 2002, the \nmonthly household income and expenditure in the sample subproject district of Bozatau in \nKarakalpakstan were SUM15,900 and SUM15,560. The corresponding figures in the sample \nsubproject district of Koshkupir in Khorezm were SUM18,900 and SUM 18,780.3 Average per \ncapita monthly income was SUM3,180 in Bozatau and SUM4,110 in Koshkupir, as compared to \nthe minimum wage of SUM3,430 per capita per month. \n \nTable A15: Income and Consumer Expenditure \n  Per Capita  Consumer  Per Capita  Consumer \n  Money Income  Expenditure  Money Income  Expenditure\nLocation  (annual)   (annual)  (per month)  (per month) \n  2001  2001  2001  2001 \nNational Average  116,520  102,600  9,710  8,550 \nKarakalpakstan  54,430  47,880  4,536  3,990 \nKhorezm  63,770  56,080  5,314  4,674 \nBozatau (Karakalpakstan)  38,160  37,800  3,180  3,150 \nKoshkupir (Khorezm)  49,320  47,760  4,110  3,980 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                      \n1  Based on Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics preliminary income and expenditure estimates for 2001. \n2  Due to high inflation, the real value of the minimum wage is less. \n3  Consumer expenditure is used as the comparative measure of wealth. \n   ", "71 Appendix 15, page 2  \nC.  Approach to Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n3.  In the absence of an official poverty line, the minimum wage of SUM3,430 per capita \nwas used to calculate the percentage of poor beneficiaries. This has been the criterion being \nused by other international funding agencies for assessing poverty in Karakalpakstan. Using \nincome alone provides a relatively narrow definition of poverty, and tend to ignore the economic, \ncultural,  and  social  situation  in  the  project  area,  as  well  as  nonmonetary  benefits  and \nunregistered income. Given the economic situation in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, particularly \nin the rural areas, where a large portion of people\u2019s income from agriculture has been lost due \nto the drought, the use of the national minimum wage is a conservative measure of the level of \npoverty in the project area.  \n \nD.  Loan Classification \n \n4.  Based on a poverty line of SUM3,430 per capita per month and the social research \nresults,4 over 60 percent of project beneficiaries are poor. This includes 80 percent in Bozatau \nand  55  percent  in  Koshkupir  district.  The  loan  is  therefore  classified  as  a  core  poverty \nintervention since the proportion of beneficiaries classified as poor is above 50 percent. \n \nE.  Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n5.  The assessment of poverty impact used for this Project has considered (i) the extent to \nwhich the project targets areas where the rural poor are located, (ii) the proportion of project \nbeneficiaries who are poor, (iii) the targeting of the project loan toward the poor, and (iv) the \nimpact on the quality of life of the poor. \n \n6.  Identification of the poor within a set of project beneficiaries is possible for this Project \nconsidering that the project area is rural where the majority of the population have limited \nincome opportunities due to depressed economic conditions in these two regions. All target \nbeneficiaries will benefit from the improvements to the water supply services. The benefits \ninclude access to safe and clean water, better health, time savings from fetching water for more \nproductive uses, and overall improvement to the livelihood of the population. \n \n7.  Using  a  poverty  line  of  SUM  3,430  per  capita  per  month,  the  proportion  of  poor \nhouseholds in the two sample project districts is over 60 percent. The majority of the Project\u2019s \nbeneficiaries are poor as they cannot afford to pay for alternatives. This situation will worsen if \nthe  Project  does  not  go  ahead  as  the  source  of  water  continues  to  deplete,  and  the \ninfrastructure facilities continue to deteriorate such that water supply will decease entirely. \n \n8.  The loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides 58.5 percent of the project \ncosts. The funds will be targeted at project beneficiaries, over 60 percent of whom are poor. \nBased on this, at least $22.8 million of the funds will be targeted to the rural poor. \n \n9.  Poverty impact is also measured in terms of quality of life related to a definition of an \nacceptable rural living standard including access to basic services such as water supply and \nsanitation facilities, all of which are included in the ADB objective of poverty reduction. For this \nProject the acceptable rural living standard is assumed to be when the population is able to \naccess clean water to meet their basic needs such as drinking and washing. The poor quality of \n                                                      \n4  Research included a socioeconomic survey, field visits, and focus group discussions.  \n   ", "72 Appendix 15, page 3  \nwater and the cost of treating the water for consumption are also taken into account.5 Further, \nthese problems have limited the economic potential of the area, aggravating poverty conditions.6 \n \n10.  Quality of life measures for households appropriate for the water supply component of \nthis  Project  include  (i)  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  (ii)  access  to  washing  facilities,  (iii) \nmorbidity level due to exposure to waterborne disease, (iv) cost of making water potable, and \n(v) proportion of the day spent collecting water (i.e., loss of productive time) and storage. Area \ntargeting of low-income households is achieved under the Project with lower income households \nprovided access to safe drinking water that is affordable. Service standards will be upgraded \nresulting in improved water quality that will have a positive impact on the health conditions of the \nrural population. This situation will enable the rural poor to save on medical costs. These will \nhave long-term implications in mitigating poverty where families become less vulnerable to \nsickness and more involved with productive work. Children\u2019s education will be more secure and \nimproved sanitary conditions in schools will be more conducive for learning. \n \n11.  The Project will also provide opportunities for women to use their time more productively \nsince they will not have to spend a large amount of time fetching water. Small- and medium-size \nbusinesses are likely to improve productivity with a continuous supply of water. The Project will \nalso  create  construction  job  opportunities  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  the \nimplementation stage. The Project will create about 600 person-months of skilled employment \nand about 800 person-months of unskilled employment. \n \nF.  Conclusion \n \n12.  Over 60 percent of the project beneficiaries are poor, and at least $22.8 million of the \nloan will be targeted to them. Providing access to safe water will improve the quality of life of the \nrural poor, who are more vulnerable to lack of water supply. The Project will reduce both the \nmonetary and nonmonetary effects of acute water shortage, which perpetuate the poverty cycle \nof the rural poor. The Project will support the Government\u2019s long-term objective, which is to \nachieve 100 percent piped water service in both rural and urban areas in Karakalpakstan \nKhorezm, and to improve the livelihood of the people in these two regions that have been \nsuffering from the Aral Sea water problem.  \n                                                      \n5 The poor and declining surface water quality due to salinity attributable to extensive upstream irrigation in the \nAmudarya basin, and wasteful irrigation and poor drainage practices in Karakalpakstan have compounded the \nproblem of the lack of good quality water for domestic use. Other water sources such as shallow wells do not \nprovide a stable water supply as the level of water in these wells is subject to seasonal variations and many have \ndried up because of the drought. Groundwater when available is often of high mineral content and requires \ndesalination before it becomes potable. \n6 The rural poor despite receiving some form of social stipends such as pensions, unemployment support, and \nsupport for mothers with infants, need to earn extra cash income from private production of farm products. \nHowever, land productivity has declined considerably due to lack of water and little income is derived from land \ncultivation. Many poor households have to sell their limited assets to buy food, clothing, and other necessities. \n   "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20020424172302Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20030225162722+08'00'"}}
