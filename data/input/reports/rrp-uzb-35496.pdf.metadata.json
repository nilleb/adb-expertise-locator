Over  60 \npercent  of  the  population  are  poor.  The  Project  will  provide \nurgently  needed  assistance \nthe  worsening \nconsequences  of  drought  during  the  past  two  years.  The  Project \nwill  complement  a  wide-ranging  package  of  initiatives  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s Aral Sea Drought Relief Program being funded by \ninternational development agencies to support the communities in \nthe drought disaster area in western Uzbekistan. The Project will \nsupport  long-term  sustainable  water  supply  management  by \nintroducing water conservation measures, educating the public on \nthe  value  of  water,  and  promoting  health  awareness  campaigns. \nthe  needs  of  Project  beneficiaries,  a \nTo  better  address \nparticipatory  approach  will  be  adopted  when  formulating  and \ndesigning  subprojects  under \nthe \nbeneficiaries will be involved in implementation.  \n \nPoverty: Core poverty intervention  \n \nThematic: Human development \n \nCategory B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nthe  summary  is  a  core  appendix.  The  Project  will  not  have  any \nadverse  impact  on  the  environment,  but  will  have  a  positive \nimpact by improving the quantity and quality of potable water and \nsanitation facilities.  \n \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  are  located  in  the  driest  part  of \nUzbekistan with annual rainfall ranging from 70 to 110 millimeters. \nOver  the  last  three  decades,  the  drying  up  of  the  Aral  Sea  has \naggravated \nthe  water  shortage  problem.  Since  mid-2000, \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm have been suffering from the worst \ndrought  in  100  years.  About  90  percent  of  the  rice  crop  and  75 \npercent  of  the  cotton  crop  were  lost  in  2000  and  2001.  Many \nfamilies  in  rural  communities  have  lost  direct  access  to  safe \ndrinking  water  and  their  main  source  of  income  from  agriculture. \nWomen and children are often required to fetch water from distant \nalternative  sources.  Drinking  water,  where  available,  is  often \ncontaminated and of poor quality, exposing the population to high \nrisks of waterborne diseases and carcinogenic and immunological \nproblems.  The  water  shortage  situation  needs  to  be  addressed \nurgently as the condition has deteriorated rapidly since the onset \nof  the  current  drought.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  a \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale \n \n\n\f  \n\niii\n\nis  being  addressed \n\nthe  country.  Subregional  water \n\nprogram  for  short-term  humanitarian  relief  and  medium-  to  long-\nterm  water \nresource  management  supported  by  various \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies.  The  Project  will  provide  a \nreliable  supply  of  potable  water,  alleviate  human  suffering  from \nthe  drought,  and  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  to  manage \nscarce water resources in a sustainable manner. The Project will \nallow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to play a key role in the \njoint effort by international aid agencies to assist the Government \nin  combating  the  water  shortage  and  drought  problems  in  the \npoorest  part  of \nresource \nmanagement \nin  parallel  supported  by \ninternational  development  agencies,  including  ADB,  through \nassistance  to  encourage  greater  cooperation  in  transboundary \nwater  use,  more  effective  and  sustainable  subregional  water \nresource  management,  and  encouraging  changes  in  agricultural \npractices. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  and \nhealth  conditions  in  the  rural  communities  in  Karakalpalstan  and \nKhorezm.  The  Project  will  provide  safe  and  easily  accessible \nwater  supply,  minimize  water  wastage,  and  improve  health \nconditions  by  supporting  the  provision  of  sanitation  facilities  and \nencouraging better hygiene practices. The Project will mitigate the \nongoing  effects  of  the  drought  and  will  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity  for  potable  water  resource  management  to  ensure  the \nGovernment\u2019s  water  supply  program  in  western  Uzbekistan  is \nsustainable.  \n \nThe  Project  comprises  three  parts:  (i)  potable  water  supply,  (ii) \nwater  conservation  and  health  improvement,  and  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding.  Potable  water  supply  includes  the  development  of  new \nsystems,  and  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  facilities. \nThe  aim  is  to  expand  the  coverage  of  potable  water  supply  to \nhouseholds  in  rural  districts  from  a  minimum  of  12  percent  to  85 \npercent,  reduce  unaccounted  for  water  losses  from  over  50 \npercent  to  30  percent,  increase  supply  efficiency  of  bulk  water \nand  service  delivery,  and  lower  unit  costs  of  production.  Water \nconservation  and  health  improvement  include  introducing  water \nconservation  measures,  improving  sanitation  facilities  in  schools \nand  clinics,  and  promoting  water-  and  sanitation-related  health \nfor  project \nawareness.  Capacity  building \nmanagement  and  institutional  strengthening  on  water  supply \nmanagement.  \n \nThe  main  elements  (the  bulk  water  supply  components)  of  the \nProject  are  defined  in  detail.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  flexible \napproach  where  community  level  subprojects  will  be  selected, \nplanned,  and  implemented  during  project  implementation  to \nensure  assistance  is  given  to  areas  with  the  most  urgent  need \nand to allow for coordination with other aid agencies.

The majority of the beneficiaries are poor. An \nincreased  and  more  reliable  supply  of  potable  water  and \nsanitation facilities will improve the health and general welfare of \nthe  beneficiaries,  in  particular  the  vulnerable  groups  who  are \nunable  to  afford  coping  mechanisms  such  as  bottled  water  and \nmust  rely  on  unsafe  water  sources.  By  reducing  leakage  and \nlosses  in  water  supply,  existing  efficiencies  and  resulting  costs \ncan  be  minimized.  The  participatory  approach  to  selection  of \nsubprojects will enhance ownership among beneficiaries, which in \nturn  will  improve  sustainability  of  project  facilities  and  generate \nsupport  for  ongoing  operation  and  maintenance  of  equipment, \nand  voluntary  water  conservation  measures  and  health \nawareness. Stability of supply and improved standards of service \nwill increase the willingness to pay for service and will contribute \nto  the  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  costs  in  a  staged \nmanner,  affordable  to  the  population.  A  stepped  tariff  structure \nbased  on  volume  of  consumption  is  proposed  including  a  lifeline \ntariff  for  the  low-income  group.  The  proposed  tariff  charges  for \naverage  consumption  of  between  60  and  75  liters  per  capita  per \nday is about 3 to 5 percent of the household income, in line with \nADB\u2019s  affordability  criteria  of  5  percent  of  household  income. \nTariff review will be undertaken annually taking into consideration \noperating  costs,  design  consumption  and  affordability;  the  tariff \nwill  be  adjusted  accordingly. \nInformation,  education,  and \ncommunication  campaigns  will  steer  public  attitude  toward  more \nresponsible  water  usage  and  better  sanitation  and  health \npractices.

The area is adjacent to the Aral Sea \nand  covers  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  (Karakalpakstan)  and  the  province  of  Khorezm. \nDuring  project  processing,  ADB  recognized  that  while  immediate  relief  was  needed  for  those \nsuffering  from  the  drought,  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  water  resource  management \nissues was equally important to ensure sustainable development of potable water supply in the \nproject  area.  Accordingly,  a  small-scale  project  preparation  technical  assistance  (TA)  was \napproved  in  January  2002  to  help  the  Government  develop  the  project  proposal.1  Close \nconsultation  with  the  communities  and  detailed  analyses  were  carried  out  under  the  TA.  A \nparticipatory approach, involving the communities and local government agencies, was used to \nformulate the Project. This report is based on the findings of the Fact-Finding Mission from 4 to \n25 February 20022 and earlier ADB missions, and has incorporated feedback from consultations \nwith  project  beneficiaries;  reports  prepared  by  the  TA  consultants;  and  discussions  with  the \ncentral  and \ninternational  assistance  agencies,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nlocal  governments, \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \nA. \n\nSector Description \n \n1. \n\nWater Resources in Western Uzbekistan \n\n \n3. \nIn 1960 the Aral Sea was the fourth largest inland lake in the world. Increasing use of the \nmain  contributory  rivers  of  Amudarya  and  Syrdarya  for  water  intensive  agriculture,  particularly \ncotton and rice growing, has resulted in greatly reduced volumes of water entering the Aral Sea. \nAs  a  result,  the  sea  has  shrunk  to  less  than  half  its  original  size  and  only  20  percent  of  its \noriginal volume. The desiccation of the Aral Sea has resulted in the loss of its fishing, tourism, \nand shipping industries, and the destruction of the ecosystem of the sea and deltas. The salty \ndesert  that  has  now  been  formed  results  in  up  to  100  million  tons  of  windblown  salt  dust \ncontaminating  the  surrounding  regions  in  Uzbekistan  and  Kazakhstan,  further  inhibiting \nagricultural  production.  From  the  mid-1990s,  a  decline  in  snow  and  glacier  melt  from  the \nsurrounding  mountains  combined  with  a  reduction  in  rainfall  have  significantly  reduced  the \nnatural  resources  of  water  within  the  two  major  watersheds.  The  Amudarya  River  in  particular \nhas been the main source of fluvial and shallow aquifer abstraction for human consumption and \n\n                                                 \n1  TA 3828-UZB: Aral Sea Area Drought Relief Project, for $150,000, approved on 3 January 2002. \n2  The  Mission  comprised  A.  Leung,  Urban  Development  Specialist  and  Mission  Leader;  L.  Nazarbekova,  Counsel; \nM.  Perlas,  Senior  Portfolio  Management  Specialist,  Uzbekistan  Resident  Mission  (URM);  R.  Abdukayumov, \nPortfolio  Management  Officer  (URM);  J.  Leleu,  Water  Supply  Engineer  (TA  consultant);  L.  Thorn,  Social \nDevelopment  Specialist  (TA  consultant);  and  T.  Villareal,  Economic  and  Financial  Analyst  (TA  consultant).  As  all \nissues  were  resolved  during  the  Mission,  Management  approved  waiving  the  appraisal  mission  under  the  New \nBusiness Processes. \n\n\f \n\n \n2\n\n \n\nagricultural use in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, and the reduced volume of flow has resulted in \nthe present drought conditions.   \n \n4. \nThe  annual  flow  of  the  Amudarya  River  at  Tuyamuyun,  a  complex  of  lakes  and \nreservoirs located approximately 400 kilometers (km) upstream of the Aral Sea and where the \nAmudarya  River  flows  from  Turkmenistan  into  Uzbekistan,  was  around  40,000  million  cubic \nmeters  (m3)  between  1991  and  1999.  In  2000,  the  flow  at  Tuyamuyun  reduced  to  an  annual \naverage  of  20,180  million  m3  and  this  dropped  to  14,400  million  m3  in  2001.  In  each  of  these \nyears, the river has run dry before it reached the Aral Sea. Impounding reservoirs constructed \non the Amudarya River at Tuyamuyun enable the diversion of flows into primary irrigation canals \nfrom  which  water  is  fed  by  gravity  to  the  entire  irrigation  network  in  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm.  The  raw  water  supply  for  Nukus,  the  capital  city,  and  other  towns  and  villages  in \nKarakalpakstan, and for Urgench, the capital city, and the towns and settlements in Khorezm, \nare  extracted  from  such  canals.  The  drought  conditions  have  resulted  in  insufficient  water  to \nproperly  supply  these  canals,  with  the  consequences  of  very  limited  available  water  or  water \nbelow  the  level  of  gravity  supply,  thus  requiring  pumping  and  incurring  associated  overhead \ncosts.  \n \n5. \nAnother  source  of  water  supply  is  groundwater  found  in  aquifers  at  varying  depths, \nalthough  the  quality  of  such  water  varies  considerably  and  is  mostly  nonpotable  due  to \ncontamination  from  leached  salts  and  agricultural  chemicals.  Deep  groundwater  is  the  main \nalternative and sustainable source. It is located between 400 and 900 meters below ground and \nis unaffected by surface activities such as pollutant discharges. However, deep groundwater is \nextremely high in mineral salts and requires desalination prior to human consumption. \n \n6. \nThe  formal  supply  of  potable  water  throughout  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  is  from  a \ncombination  of  wells,  boreholes,  and,  increasingly,  by  bulk  water  transmission  from  both  the \nAmudarya  River  and  the  Tuyamuyon  complex.  These  sources  provide  water  to  approximately \n71  percent  of  the  population  in  Karakalpakstan  and  64  percent  in  Khorezm.  The  bulk  water \nabstraction  scheme  comprises  pumping  from  the  Karapas  reservoir  in  the  Tuyamuyon  lake \ncomplex  and  from  the  main  stream  reservoir  of  the  Amudarya  River.  The  abstracted  water, \namounting  to  about  470,000  m3/day,  is  then  treated  and  transmitted  to  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm.  Water  abstracted  from  the  Amudarya  River  at  Tuyamuyun  and  downstream  for \npotable  use  represents  only  5  percent  of  the  total  annual  flow,  the  remainder  is  used  for \nirrigation.  Water  distribution  centers  (WDCs)  receive  bulk  water  from  the  transmission  mains. \nAfter  storage  and  further  disinfection,  the  water  is  pumped  into  the  distribution  networks.  In \nareas where WDCs are not supplied by trunk mains, water is obtained from boreholes and deep \nwells,  and  is  desalinated  and  disinfected  before  being  pumped  for  distribution.  Distribution  is \nmainly  by  pipe  systems  but  also  by  tankers  where  settlement  is  remote.  Other  means  of \nsupplying  water  to  the  rural  population  are  shallow  open  wells  and  hand  pumps,  but  in  these \nlatter cases, water quality does not meet national or international standards. \n\n \n2. \n\nImpact of the Drought \n\n \nThe drought has resulted in severely worsening water resources in the project area. In \n7. \n2000, water flow to this area was about 40 percent of the long-term annual average. This has \nworsened  in  2001  with  estimated  water  resources  (including  both  potable  and  nonpotable)  in \nKarakalpakstan at only 70 percent of the 2000 level and 30 percent of the 1999 level. Inefficient \nwater management practices and lack of water conservation awareness exacerbate the already \ndifficult situation. In 2000, about 90 percent of the rice crop and about 75 percent of the cotton \ncrop were lost. Similar losses are anticipated in 2001, including significant losses in the wheat \n\n\f \n\n \n3\n\n \n\nharvest.  In  2001,  due  to  the  continued  water  shortage,  the  Government  had  to  reduce  the \noverall  cropping  area,  mainly  among  the  rice-growing  areas,  because  of  its  water  intensive \nrequirements. Initiatives by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization are currently \nongoing  to  pilot  alternative  agricultural  cropping  that  is  less  water  intensive.  However,  until \nresults  are  available  and  farming  practices  change,  the  current  socioeconomic  depression  will \ncontinue.3  \n \n8. \nThe  drought  and  drying  up  of  substantial  parts  of  the  Amudarya  River  and  its  canal \nnetwork  not  only  obviates  direct  availability  of  water  from  these  sources,  but  also  severely \nrestricts  the  supply  from  shallow  wells  and  medium-depth  ground  lenses  that  rely  on \ngroundwater recharge through seasonal rainfall and seepage from the river and canals. Shallow \nwells are generally located near the river and irrigation canals, and the reduction or cessation of \nflow into the canals results in falling groundwater levels and the consequential abandonment or \nneed  to  deepen  wells.  This  is  especially  true  of  the  prevailing  conditions  in  Karakalpakstan. \nWhile  all  canals  remain  operational,  the  flow  has  dwindled  from  50  m3/second  to  a  mere  2 \nm3/second. The secondary and tertiary canal systems are even more inefficient and the overall \nirrigation  efficiency  reaches  only  between  20  and  40  percent.  Much  of  the  already  reduced \nvolume of water for irrigation is therefore lost, and with it access to water for personal, livestock, \nand agricultural use. Local sources of drinking water, where available, are often contaminated \nand of poor quality leading to a high incidence of waterborne diseases in the area. \n \n\n3. \n\nSubregional Cooperation on Water Resource Management \n\n \n9. \nThe  drying  of  the  Aral  Sea  has  resulted  in  severe  and  wide-ranging  impacts  on  the \nenvironment, economy, and human population. In the late 1980s, programs were initiated by the \nformer Soviet Union to deal with the key problems in the Aral Sea region. Since independence \nin 1991, these efforts were carried out by the five nations in the Aral Sea basin\uf8e7Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan\uf8e7with  major  help  from  the \ninternational community, primarily the World Bank, the United States, and the European Union. \nThe five nations signed a water-sharing measure in 1991 that included a provision to provide at \nleast  14,000  million m3  of  water  per  year  to  the  Aral  Sea.  In  practice,  however,  this  water  has \nbeen  supplied  to  gauging  points  in  the  deltas  of  the  Amudarya  and  Syrdarya  rivers,  and \ndeliveries to the sea have been considerably smaller. In 1998, the World Bank approved a grant \nunder the Global Environmental Facility to assist the Aral Sea Basin Program of the five Central \nAsian  republics  to  address  the  root  causes  of  the  overuse  and  degradation  of  the  Aral  Sea \nBasin  waters.4  The  objectives  of  this  assistance  are  to  help  the  governments  (i)  create  a \ncommon  policy,  strategy,  and  action  programs  for  national  and  regional  water  and  salt \nmanagement; (ii) change cropping patterns to reduce irrigation; (iii) promote water conservation; \n(iv) improve transboundary water quantity and quality; and (v) restore a wetland for biodiversity \nconservation. Implementation of this project is ongoing and is progressing well. \n\n \n4. \n\nGovernment Institutions for Water Supply \n\n \nAdministration  of  the  country\u2019s  water  resources  and  potable  water  supply  is  shared  by \n10. \nvarious agencies under the overall supervision of the Cabinet of Ministers. Raw water resources \nfrom the Amudarya River and at the Tuyamuyon complex are the responsibility of the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Water Resources. The raw water abstraction facilities and transmission network \n\n                                                 \n3    From  a  mission  of  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  to  identify  agricultural  interventions  in  drought  affected \n\nareas of Uzbekistan, carried out in January, 2002. \n\n4  The  Global  Environmental  Facility  $12.2  million  grant  for  the  Aral  Sea  Basin  Program/Water  and  Environmental \n\nManagement Project is administered by the World Bank. \n\n\f \n\n \n4\n\n \n\nis under the overall responsibility of the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA). Two \nUCSA  departments,  one  each  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  are  responsible  for  operating \nabstraction pumping stations, treatment works, and transmission pipelines in the two regions.  \n \nIn  Khorezm,  water  from  the  transmission  mains  is  supplied  to  both  the  vodokanals \n11. \n(urban  water  and  sewerage  agencies)  and  the  agrovodokanals  (rural  water  and  sewerage \nagencies).  Both  vodokanals  and  agrovodokanals  are  under  the  supervision  of  the  Territorial \nCommunal Services Agency (TCSA), which reports to the provincial governor. The TCSA is also \nresponsible for the province\u2019s sanitation, central heating, and solid waste systems, among other \nresponsibilities relating to public services. However, sanitation service to the rural communities \nis  minimal  with  only  occasional  solid  waste  collection.  In  Karakalpakstan,  water  from  the \ntransmission mains is supplied to the vodokanals, which report to the TCSA in Karakalpakstan. \nWater from the transmission mains is also supplied to agrovodokanals, which report directly to \nthe Council of Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. \n \n12. \nThe  agrovodokanals  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  are  responsible  for  the  operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of rural water supply systems, yet a serious deficiency exists in their \nfunctional ability to efficiently manage their assets and deliver services to consumers. Financial \nmanagement  is  weak  and  not  based  on  commercial  principles.  While  tariffs  are  in  place,  they \nare low and not able to cover the full cost of service provisions. The problems are due to (i) the \nagrovodokanals  being  transferred  out  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources \nwithout  the  benefits  of  adequate  technical  support  or  operational  equipment;  (ii)  inability  to \nmanage  their  assets  in  a  structured  and  efficient  manner;  (iii)  lack  of  experience  in  modern \nwater supply practice and techniques; and (iv) lack of experience in working in partnership with \nconsumer  groups  and  NGOs.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  agrovodokanals  and  their  staff \nneeds to be strengthened through structured training.  \n \n13.  Water  quality  standards  are  monitored  by  the  State  Epidemiological  Survey,  which  is \npart of the Ministry of Health and maintains operational units in each province or region. These \nunits  have  the  responsibility  to  monitor  the  quality  standards  of  potable  water  supply  or \nwastewater  discharge,  and  can  levy  penalties  for  noncompliance  by  the  vodokanals  or \nagrovodokanals. \n \n14. \nAt the central level, coordination of the activities of UCSA, the Karakalpakstan Council of \nMinisters,  and  the  Khorezm  provincial  government  is  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of \nMacroeconomics  and  Statistics \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment  is  tasked  to  (i)  develop  plans  for  improving  rural  water  and  gas  supply  systems \njointly  with  UCSA,  the  Karakalpakstan  Council  of  Ministers,  and  the  Khorezm  provincial \ngovernment;  (ii)  define  cost-sharing  arrangements  between  the  central  and  local  governments \nfor financing projects jointly with the Ministry of Finance and the above-mentioned three bodies; \nand  (iii)  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  these  activities.  In  addition,  MMS  coordinates  the \nimplementation of an ongoing World Bank water supply, sanitation, and health project,5 as well \nas  other  aid-funded  projects  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.

As of 1 January 2001, \nthe  potable  water  supply  coverage  for  the  rural  population  of  Uzbekistan  was  72.3  percent \ncompared with 41.6 percent for Karakalpakstan and 55.5 percent for Khorezm. However, these \nlatter  two  figures  reflect  coverage  in  terms  of  water  supply  facilities,  not  actual  availability  of \nwater for the population. The drought and water shortages have rendered part of those facilities \nnonfunctional.6  Furthermore,  the  drought,  water  shortage  in  the  Amudarya  River,  and  rapidly \nfalling water tables have caused many shallow wells and irrigation canals to dry up. Since about \n51  percent  of  all  households,  comprising  close  to  100,000  households  and  about  560,000 \nindividuals, in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm rely on either open wells or shallow boreholes, this \nrestricted  or  lost  access  to  water  is  catastrophic.  Even  before  this  loss  of  supply,  the  water \nsources contained a salinity level that was nearly double the maximum allowable concentration \nrecommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization.7  The  water  shortage  has  resulted  in \ndegradation  of  the  environment  and  deterioration  of  the  living  conditions  of  the  people. \nTherefore, alternative and sustainable resources for potable supplies are urgently needed. \n \n\nb. \n\nHealth, Hygiene, and Sanitation \n\n \n16. \nThe  lack  and  poor  quality  of  potable  water  have  posed  serious  health  risks  to  the \npopulation  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  over  the  decades,  especially  for  women  and \nchildren.  These  are  caused  mainly  by  drinking  water  contaminated  with  salt  and  fecal  matter, \nheavy mineral content, pesticides, and fertilizers. According to the State Epidemiological Survey \n(para.  13),  34.4  percent  of  samples  taken  from  all  surface  waters  in  Khorezm  in  2000  did  not \nmeet  the  state  standards  for  microbiological  safety  and  15  percent  exhibited  positive  cholera-\nlike  vibrios.  Rural  sanitary  facilities  comprise  largely  simple,  open  pit  latrines.  Unsanitary  and \nbadly maintained pit latrines without the benefit of water for even basic hand washing, a general \nlack of satisfactory personal hygiene practices, and the severely restricted availability of water \nrenders  the  population,  particularly  school  children,  at  serious  risk  to  infections.  Hygiene \nawareness is low or nonexistent in many rural communities. \n \n17. \nAccording  to  a  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  report  (footnote  7),  the \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  areas  are  characterized  by  the  highest  rate  of  infant  mortality \n(about  52  per  1,000  live  births)  and  maternal  mortality  (about  100  per  100,000  live  births)  in \nCentral Asia. Typical health problems in Karakalpakstan are diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis \nA, allergies, and illnesses related to neurological, carcinogenic, immunological, and reproductive \nfunctions.8  Liver  cancer  has  increased  five-fold  in  the  last  decade.  Birth  defects  are  five  times \nhigher than in Europe, 90 percent of pregnancies have complications, and about 30 percent of \npregnant women have kidney diseases. About 30\u201380 percent of children under 3 years and 50\u2013\n80 percent of women in the fertile age group suffer from anemia; the tuberculosis incidence at \n150\u2013250 per 100,000 population is among the highest in Central Asia. Children suffering from \nmalnutrition  and  other  diseases  have  problems  concentrating  and  learning.  As  a  result  of  the \n\n                                                 \n6  For example, in the district of Koshkupir in Khorezm, 27 percent of rural households have access to a piped water \n\nsupply, although in practice only 12 percent benefit from a system that is operational. \n\n7  UNICEF. 2001.

Tashkent. \n\n8  In 2000, diarrhea cases rose dramatically with an increase of 36 percent in June alone. An 80 percent increase in \n\nhepatitis A was recorded during the first six months. \n\n\f \n\n \n6\n\n \n\ndrought,  children,  especially  girls,  who  normally  help  with  household  chores,  have  the  added \ntask of collecting water from more distant sources. These problems have contributed to reduced \nattendance  at  school  and  a  higher  educational  dropout  rate,  seriously  impairing  children\u2019s \nprospects for future learning.  \n \n\nc. \n\nAgriculture and Unemployment  \n\n \n18. \nThe  main  economic  activities  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  are  agriculture  and \nagroprocessing.  Agriculture  alone  accounts  for  about  30  percent  of  Karakalpakstan\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product and about 40 percent of Khorezm\u2019s gross domestic product. Crop production \nin both areas is almost totally irrigation dependent. Sail salinity is medium to high in 28 percent \nof the irrigated land. About 20 percent of irrigated land has such high salt and mineral content \nthat it requires annual leaching by using high amounts of fresh river water\u2014a practice that leads \nto increased water consumption for irrigation. Productivity of irrigated land in Karakalpakstan is \n4.5 times lower than the national average, and in Khorezm 1.4 times. As a consequence of the \nwater shortage problem, an estimated 15\u201320 percent of potential agricultural productivity is lost \nannually. During 2000, losses in agricultural production in Karakalpakstan alone were estimated \nat about SUM15 billion ($21.6 million equivalent).9 Other effects include increases in food prices \nand depletion of family food reserves for the winter. Due to the shortage of irrigation water that \nis  exacerbated  by  the  drought,  crop  seeding  was  halved  in  2001  and  an  estimated  additional \n100,000  people  (79,000  in  Karakalpakstan  and  21,000  in  Khorezm)  became  temporarily \nunemployed.10  The  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  reported  that  the  registered \nunemployed rose by about 13 percent in Karakalpakstan and 41 percent in  Khorezm, between \nthe first quarters of 2000 and 2001. According to MMS, unemployment in Karakalpakstan was \n82.2 percent and in Khorezm 66.8 percent in 2001. The majority of the unemployed were in the \nagriculture sector. \n\n \nd. \n\nPoverty  \n\n \n19. \nThe Government does not have a generally agreed or reliable measure of poverty or an \nofficial poverty line. The poor are classified based on the prevailing minimum wage adjusted for \ninflation,  and  instead  of  the  term  \u201cpoverty,\u201d  living  standards  are  used  in  official  documents.11 \nADB is currently implementing TA to help the Government develop a medium-term strategy for \nimproving living standards.12 Recent work by the World Bank, the European Union\u2019s Technical \nAssistance  to  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  and  the  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  using  the  minimum \nwage  criteria  showed  that  urban  poverty  in  Karakalpakstan  was  about  50  percent  compared \nwith 10 percent in Tashkent (national capital) and 28 percent in Ferghana province. Due to the \nhigher  percentage  of  rural  population  and  the  impact  of  agricultural  losses,  rural  poverty  is \nhigher.  The  poor  comprise  mostly  the  unemployed,  the  marginally  self-employed,  and  those \nin \nemployed \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  have  inevitably  increased  the  number  of  those  living  below \nsubsistence levels in the two areas. \n \n\njobs.

Approximately  160  NGOs \nare registered in Karakalpakstan with activities focusing on water and ecological issues, and on \npublic  health  awareness.  Only  about  40  are  registered  in  Khorezm.  Community-based \norganizations (CBOs) are also well developed and comprise local rural assemblies. These rural \nassemblies are legal entities headed by respected local elders, most of whom are male. Each \nrural  assembly  is  in  charge  of  a  number  of  mahallas,  which  is  a  traditional  cultural  form  of \ngovernment  in  Uzbekistan  for  administering  social  assistance  on  behalf  of  the  state.  The  rural \nassemblies  are  responsible  for  community  affairs  including  enforcing  laws,  implementing  local \nlegislation, ensuring timely payment of taxes and charges for communal services, and allocating \nsocial  benefits.  Women\u2019s  committees  exist  in  both  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  These \ngovernment-recognized groups are responsible for women\u2019s affairs in the community and have \nthe potential to assist with community projects. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nSince  independence,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  policy  of  developing  stable  and \nflexible  water  supply,  strengthening  the  water  supply  agencies  involved,  and  developing  and \nimplementing  water  conservation  programs.  Special  emphasis  has  been  given  to  rural  water \nsupply that historically was lagging behind the pace of development of urban water supply. The \nGovernment passed two resolutions, one in 1996 and the other in 1998, mandating programs to \nconstruct 9,500 km of piped networks in rural areas and 750 km in urban areas during 1996\u2013\n2000. Included were 2,030 km of rural piped networks and 80 km of urban piped networks for \nKarakalpakstan,  and  960  km  and  75  km,  respectively,  for  Khorezm.13  The  completion  of  this \nwork,  which  was  funded  domestically,  achieved  coverage  of  about  80  percent  of  the  urban \npopulation  and  46.1  percent  of  the  rural  population  in  Karakalpakstan.  The  corresponding \nfigures  for  Khorezm  were  91  percent  and  55.5  percent.  However,  as  mentioned  in  para.  15, \nactual availability of water for the rural population remains a serious problem.  \n \n22. \nAnother Government resolution in June 1999 mandates the scope of development of the \ncountry\u2019s  rural  water  supply  until  2010.14  In  preparing  the  resolution,  a  detailed  inventory  was \nmade  of  all  rural  settlements  in  the  country  and  identified  unserved  settlements.  For \nKarakalpakstan,  the  target  is  to  provide  water  to  784  additional  rural  settlements,  thereby \nreaching  coverage  of  94.1  percent  of  the  population  by  2010.  For  Khorezm,  the  target  is  to \nprovide  144  additional  rural  settlements  with  water  supply  to  reach  a  coverage  level  of  94.4 \npercent  of  the  population  by  2010.  The  Government  recognizes  that  the  drought  and  water \nmanagement problems need to be addressed through a practical and sustainable strategy that \ncomprises  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  measures.  The  10-year  Aral  Sea  Drought  Relief \nProgram  for  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  was  formulated  in  2000.  Besides  improving  the \nquantity  and  quality  of  potable  water  supply,  the  program  includes  health  care,  microcredit-\nbased  employment  generation,  social  protection  of  vulnerable  families  especially  in  the  fall-\nwinter  season,  and  irrigation  and  drainage.  Long-term  measures  include  incentives  for  water \nconservation and changes in crop patterns, improvement of the financial and technical capacity \nof the water utilities to operate and manage the facilities, introduction of cost-based tariffs, and \ndevelopment of small and medium enterprises to reduce reliance on agriculture.

The \nprogram  is  estimated  at  about  $550  million  and  external  assistance  is  required  to  meet  the \nfunding requirement. \n \n23. \nThe  Government\u2019s  short-term  program  for  potable  water  supply  to  provide  immediate \nrelief  to  the  drought-affected  population  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  include  (i)  focus  on \nrural  areas  where  piped  or  subsurface  water  is  unavailable;  (ii)  access  to  drinking  water  for \nchildren  and  sick  people  through  services  to  schools  and  hospitals;  (iii)  installation  of  hand \npumps in areas where there is no piped water supply and where groundwater can be extracted \nby  hand  pumps;  (iv)  rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  water  treatment  plants;  and  (v)  use  of \ntanker  trucks  to  transport  water  to  population  groups  that  do  not  have  any  of  the  above-\nmentioned  water  sources.  The  Government  issued  a  decree  in  June  2001  to  implement  the \nprogram.15  The  decree  included  social  measures  to  address  the  deteriorating  situation  as  a \nresult of the drought. These include assistance to vulnerable groups, exemption of certain taxes, \nand provision of credits for cattle. The Government has also agreed to write off debts of farmers \nin Karakalpakstan and Khorezm to the total value of SUM12.9 billion ($18.6 million equivalent). \n \nC. \n \nExternal  assistance  to  the  water  supply  sector  in  Uzbekistan  is  increasing  although \n24. \nlargely focused in urban areas. This includes an ongoing World Bank water supply, sanitation, \nand  health  project  in  the  cities  of  Nukus  and  Urgench  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  and  a \nproject  recently  approved  by  the  World  Bank  for  water  supply  in  the  cities  of  Bukhara  and \nSamarkand. Bilateral assistance includes a number of projects under preparation. The French \ngovernment is proposing assistance for water supply and sanitation in the cities of Namangan \nand  Samarkand,  and  has  expressed  strong  interest  in  providing  financial  support  for  the \nproposed  Project.  The  Spanish  government  is  considering  assistance  for  water  supply  in \nBukhara. Assistance to cross-border cooperation on water and energy issues is being provided \nby  the  World  Bank  (para.  9)  and  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID) under its Environmental Policies and Institutions for Central Asia initiative. Phase II of \nthis initiative addressed institutional development of Aral Sea Basin water management and the \nforthcoming Phase III will improve water and energy management. \n \n25. \nADB  recently  approved  a  loan  to  finance  an  urban  water  supply  project  for  three \nprovincial  cities16  and  a  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  to  support \ninnovative poverty reduction initiatives in Karakalpakstan.17 A loan and two TAs are included in \nthe 2002\u20132004 country program to assist the Government with water resource management for \nagriculture  and  capacity  building  of  water  supply  agencies.18  On  subregional  water  resource \nmanagement,  ADB  is  currently  implementing  a  TA  on  regional  cooperation  on  shared  water \nresources  that  includes  the  Central  Asian  republics19  and  is  working  on  a  water  energy  nexus \n\n                                                 \n15 Government Resolution No. 249, On Additional Measures for Social Protection of the Population and Mitigation of \nConsequences  of  Water  Shortage  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  Province,  passed  on  8  June \n2001. \n\n16 Loan 1842-UZB: Urban Water Supply Project, for $36.0 million, approved on 27 September 2001. \n17  JPFR  9010-UZB:  Supporting  Innovative  Poverty  Reduction  in  Karakalpalstan,  for  $2.54  million,  approved  on  25   \n\nOctober 2001. The project includes the provision of hand pumps to villages. \n\n18 Loan: Water Resources Management for Agriculture to be processed in 2003; project preparatory TA: Improvement \nof Water Resources Management for Agriculture ($600,000) and advisory TA: Capacity Building for Water Supply \nAgencies ($600,000) to be processed in 2002. \n\n19  TA  6001-REG:  Regional  Consultation  for  the  Third  World  Water  Forum,  for  $1,000,000,  approved  on  9  October \n\n2001. \n\n\f \n\n \n9\n\n \n\nstudy  jointly  with  USAID  to  develop  a  strategy  for  supporting  transboundary  water  resource \nmanagement. A study to explore hydropower development in Central Asia is ongoing. Based on \nthe  findings  of  these  studies,  ADB  will  formulate  a  medium-term  strategy  on  regional  water \nissues, in connection with support to the energy sector.   \n \n26. \nIn  recent  years,  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  have  been  actively  assisting  the \nGovernment with its social programs to address the urgent needs of the affected population in \nwestern Uzbekistan and to manage the ecological and socioeconomic catastrophe. The World \nBank  through  its  ongoing  project  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm;  the  Kuwait  Fund  for \nEconomic  Development;  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of  Germany;  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme;  and  the  governments  of  France,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea, \nSwitzerland,  and  the  United  States  are  among  those  providing  significant  assistance.  The \nGovernment is currently negotiating with USAID to support a water supply project in a district in \nnorth  Karakalpakstan.  Appendix  3  provides  a  summary  of  the  initiatives  by  multilateral  and \nbilateral funding agencies to assist the Government\u2019s water supply program in response to the \ndrought. \n \n27. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  support  the  initiatives  under  the  JFPR  grant \n(footnote  17)  and  was  prepared  in  close  coordination  with  major  international  aid  agencies. \nCoordination has led to joint approaches on strategies to assist the Government in developing \nand implementing long-term sustainable potable water resource management on the one hand \nand mitigating the effect of the ongoing drought on the other. The Project will allow ADB to play \na  key  role  in  the  international  effort  to  provide  relief  to  the  drought-affected  population  and  to \ncontribute to longer-term solutions to potable water supply in the project area. The Project will \nfocus on rural potable water supply and improvement to public sanitation and health awareness, \nall of which are urgently needed but where funding is very limited. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nAs implementation of ADB\u2019s urban water supply project in Uzbekistan (footnote 16) has \nnot yet begun, experience from implementing water supply projects financed by other external \nfunding  agencies  and  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  in  other  social  sectors  were  considered  when  designing \nthe  Project.  Several  lessons  have  been  learned.  On  the  preparation  of  projects,  overall \nprocessing has been protracted because of difficulties encountered during policy dialogue with \nthe Government. The project development process is often delayed due to a prolonged process \nfor releasing information. Stakeholder consultation and participation is required when preparing \nprojects in accordance with the needs of the Government and beneficiaries to ensure ownership \nand commitment. The Government recognizes the need to focus on sustainability of operations \nand increasing ownership by beneficiaries. \n \nThe lessons from ADB water supply sector projects in other countries, in particular those \n29. \nin  Central  Asia,  have  also  been  studied.  In  general,  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  limited \nexperience  with  project  implementation  has  led  to  delays  and  slow  disbursement.  Another \nproblem  is  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  local  governments,  thus  requiring  substantial \ntechnical  and  financial  assistance.  These  issues  were  discussed  with  the  Government  during \nproject  formulation  and  appropriate  measures  including  project  management  support  and \ntraining  programs  on  implementation  procedures  have  been  comprehensively  incorporated  in \nthe project design. \n \n30. \nTaking  into  account  these  experiences,  the  Project  has  incorporated  the  following \nfeatures  in  its  design:  (i)  a  flexible  menu  of  subprojects  will  be  adopted  that  include  both \n\nLessons Learned \n\n\f \n\n \n10\n\n \n\nADB's Sector Strategy  \n\nstrategic  and  locally  focused  works  that  can  be  completed  within  the  required  time  frame  and \nwithin the capability of the local agencies to construct, operate, and maintain; (ii) stakeholders \nsuch  as  rural  assemblies,  women\u2019s  committees,  or  similar  community  organizations  will  be \ninvolved in developing subprojects, and may, where appropriate, be responsible for O&M of the \nfacilities;  (iii)  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  will  be  carried  out;  (iv) \nproject  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  central  and  local  governments  and  international \nfunding  agencies;  and  (v)  training  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  necessary  institutional \nprocedures and to ensure efficient and expeditious procurement. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe  central  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  Uzbekistan  is  to  help  manage  the  transition  to  a \nmarket-based economy, and support sustainable poverty reduction and improved standards of \nliving. In support of this goal, ADB\u2019s operational objectives focus on (i) managing the transition, \nincluding  supporting  basic  reforms  and  minimizing  the  social  costs  of  transition;  and  (ii) \nenhancing the potential for growth through regional cooperation, investment in the rural sector, \nand  direct  support  to  the  private  sector.  Within  this  framework,  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategies \nreinforce  the  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimproving the living standards of the vulnerable, low-income, and socially excluded segments of \nits  society.  The  2001  country  strategy  and  program  update  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in \nagriculture  and  rural  development  as  most  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  reside  in  rural  areas.  As \nmentioned  earlier,  ADB  has  provided  grant  assistance  for  supporting  poverty  reduction  in \nKarakalpakstan (footnote 17) and is assisting the Government to prepare a strategy to improve \nthe living standards in the country (footnote 12). \n \n32. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  support  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  by \naddressing  the  worsening  conditions  to  which  the  populations  of  Karakalpalstan  and  Khorezm \nare  subjected.  The  target  groups  to  be  served  by  the  Project  are  largely  poor  households  in \nrural and remote areas where primary basic needs, such as potable water supply, are lacking. \n \nF. \n \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n1. \n\nSustainable Water Resource Management \n\nthe  worsening  environmental  degradation,  and  protecting \n\n \n33. \nThe challenges of water resource management in the Aral Sea area are a legacy of the \nformer  Soviet  Union.  The  main  cause  of  the  water  scarcity  in  the  area  is  the  prolonged \ninequitable  and  inefficient  management  of  water  resources  in  the  transboundary  Amudarya \nRiver  Basin,  both  within  Uzbekistan,  and  between  the  riparian  countries.  The  Government  is \nnow faced with a dilemma on how to strike a balance between adopting stringent measures to \narrest \nlivelihood  and \nsocioeconomic  welfare  of  a  population  that  is  heavily  dependent  on  agriculture.  The \nGovernment  has  actively  participated  in  the  subregional  cooperation  on  water  resource \nmanagement  and  in  the  development  of  national  and  regional  sustainable  water  management \npolicies  and  strategies  (para.  9  and  footnote  4).  Through  policy  dialogue,  the  Government \nrecognizes  the  need  for  a  sustainable  approach  to  water  resource  management  in  western \nUzbekistan  and  the  necessity  to  complete  the  development  of  its  long-term  strategy  for \nsocioeconomic  development  in  the  area.  The  latter  is  also  supported  by  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral  assistance  agencies,  and  a  roundtable  meeting  was  held  in  October  2001  to  discuss \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\n \n11\n\n \n\nhow  the  international  community  can  assist.20  In  line  with  the  framework    discussed  at  the \nOctober  meeting,  the  Government  agreed  that  the  proposed  Project  should  achieve  two \ncomplementary objectives. The first is to assist the Government in developing its potable water \nresource  management  strategy  through  institutional  strengthening  and  training  of  concerned \nstaff.  The  second  is  to  mitigate  the  ongoing  effects  of  the  drought  in  western  Uzbekistan  by \nimproving  potable  water  supply.  ADB  has  committed  further  assistance  to  the  Government  in \ntransboundary  water  management,  water  resource  management  for  agriculture,  and  capacity \nbuilding for water supply agencies (para. 25, footnotes 18 and 19).  \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Priorities and Poverty Focus \n\n \n34.  While  the  Government  does  not  currently  have  an  explicit  poverty  reduction  strategy \n(para.  19),  it  has  invested  major  efforts  to  maintain  the  provision  of  social  services  such  as \nhealth, education, and basic communal services and social protection for vulnerable groups as \nintegral  components  of  its  reform  process  to  a  market  economy.  Basic  infrastructure \ninvestments have traditionally been planned and financed by the central Government and large \nprojects  tend  to  be  focused  in  the  urban  areas.  The  Government  realizes  that  the  need  to \nimprove basic water supply is urgent, and thus improve the health and living conditions of the \nrural  residents  in  western  Uzbekistan  who  have  long  been  suffering  from  water  shortage \nproblems  intensified  by  the  current  drought.  The  Government  agreed  that  the  Project  should \nrehabilitate and expand existing water supply facilities, develop new water supply, and introduce \nwater  conservation  and  health  improvement  measures  to  selected  poor  rural  areas.  While \nminimizing  costs,  the  emphasis  will  be  on  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  existing  facilities,  and \nusing simple technology and low-cost methods. The poverty focus is reflected in the selection of \nsubprojects  where  priority  will  be  given  to  poor  communities  that  have  a  majority  of  their \npopulation living below the minimum wage criteria and with high incidences of malnutrition and \nwaterborne  diseases.  Over  60  percent  of  the  households  in  the  targeted  project  communities \nare  earning  less  than  the  minimum  wage,  and  limited  access  to  potable  water  supply  and \nsanitation is a major issue contributing to poverty. \n \n\n3. \n\nDecentralization of Implementation and Stakeholder Participation \n\n \nCurrent Government policies, decrees, and resolutions reflect significant commitment to \n35. \nimplementing institutional and financial reforms in the water supply sector. However, top-down \napproaches  are  still  embedded  at  all  administrative  levels  of  government.  In  particular, \nparticipation  of  local  communities  is  limited.  The  Project  addresses  decentralization  and \ngovernance issues by strengthening the institutional capacity of local governments to carry out \nthe decentralized functions of providing and maintaining local water supply services. As a result \nof ADB policy dialogue with the central and local governments, the Project will be implemented \nby local governments and managed by the central Government in support of the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policy.  Experience  indicates  that  beneficiary  participation,  good  governance, \nand project sustainability are interrelated factors that contribute to project success, and need to \nbe factored into project design and implementation arrangements. The Project is structured to \nincrease  local  responsibility  for  water  supply  services  by  decentralizing  implementation  and \nO&M, and actively involving both government and community-based stakeholders. Through the \nparticipatory  process  supported  by  information  and  education  campaigns,  consumers  will  be \neducated on the need to conserve and price water as an economic resource. The Government \nalso  supports  the  need  for  capacity  building  measures,  including  training  of  local  staff  and \n\n                                                 \n20  The  roundtable  was  held  on  3  October  2001  in  Nukus,  capital  of  Karakalpakstan.  Participants  included \nrepresentatives  from,  among  others,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  United  Nation  Development  Programme,  UNICEF, \nUSAID, and various embassies including Japan, Germany, and the United States. \n\n\f \n\n \n12\n\n \n\nsupport  for  the  NGO  and  CBO  implementation  role  in  communities  to  achieve  sustainable \ndelivery of services that meet the needs of the population. \n \n\n4. \n\nCost Recovery  \n\n \n36. \nUnder the reform policy, the Government seeks to establish self-financing principles for \nthe provision of urban and rural infrastructure services. Resolution No. 243 requires full recovery \nof  O&M  costs  and  permits  charging  a  higher  tariff  to  cover  part  of  the  capital  cost.21  The \nGovernment considers that the pricing of basic infrastructure services should balance four main \nobjectives:  (i)  cost  recovery  to  ensure  financial  viability  and  sustainability;  (ii)  affordability, \nparticularly  for  lower  income  customers;  (iii)  demand  management  through  metered  charging; \nand (iv) economic efficiency. This policy will be implemented over a number of years. However, \nthe  Government  recognizes  that  it  will  be  difficult  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  for  services  to \nrural  communities  suffering  from  economic  hardship  as  a  consequence  of  the  drought. \nCurrently,  the  agrovodokanals  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  receive  Government  subsidies \nfor both capital and operating requirements. After careful analysis of the economic situation in \nthe project area, the Government agrees to (i) target full O&M cost recovery in the long term; (ii) \ncontinue subsidies in the short term if affordability criteria cannot be met; (iii) use stepped tariffs \nfor  water,  with  a  lifeline  tariff  for  the  lowest  income  group  as  a  way  forward;  and  (iv)  review \ntariffs  annually  and  adjust  them  accordingly  taking  into  account  collection  efficiency  rates, \nexpenditure, and future investment plans. The Government also confirms that it will continue the \npolicy  of  subsidizing  rural  water  supply  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  to  ensure  sustainable \nservice provision to the rural population. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n37.  Western Uzbekistan, comprising Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, has been suffering from \nwater shortage for the past three decades. The situation has deteriorated rapidly since the onset \nof the worst drought and water shortage in 100 years that started in the mid-1990s. Due to the \nshortage of irrigation water from the Amudarya River, most of the rice, cotton, and wheat crops \nwere lost in 2000 and 2001. Similar outcomes are expected in 2002. Because irrigation canals, \nwhich  used  to  be  a  main  source  of  raw  water  for  household  use,  are  now  either  dried  up  or \ndrying  up,  many  rural  households  have  lost  direct  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  as  well  as \nmeans of employment, income, and food from agriculture. Families, particularly the women and \nchildren,  are  now  fetching  water  from  distant  alternative  sources.  Drinking  water,  where \navailable,  is  often  contaminated  or  of  poor  quality,  containing  excessive  quantities  of  mineral \nsalts  and  bacterial  organisms.  Consequently,  the  population  in  the  drought-affected  areas  is \nexposed to high risks of waterborne diseases and longer-term consequences of consuming high \nlevels  of  waterborne  minerals  that  lead  to  carcinogenic  and  immunological  conditions.  In \nrecognition  of  the  urgency  of  the  problem,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  a  program  for \nimmediate relief that is receiving extensive support from the international community. Through \naid coordination, the Project will focus on improving water supply and related health gains to the \nrural population in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm where over 60 percent of the people are poor. \n \n38. \nThe Government also recognizes the need to better manage the use of water from the \nAmudarya  River,  including  sustainable  abstraction  for  agricultural  purposes  together  with  the \nestablishment  of  suitable  cropping  strategies  while  meeting  the  needs  of  the  people  of \n                                                 \n21 Resolution 243, On Measures for Implementing the Rural Water Supply Project in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, \n\napproved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 8 June 1998. \n\n\f \n\n \n13\n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.22  These  initiatives  must  be  supported  by  strengthening \ninstitutional  capacity  for  rural  water  supply  to  ensure  sustainable  delivery  of  services.  The \nProject  will  provide  capacity  building  for  local  water  supply  management,  and  for  community \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  viable  water  conservation  measures.  In  particular,  the \nProject will strengthen the sustainability of potable water supplies to ensure secure and regular \navailability,  largely  independent  of  seasonal  variations  in  raw  water  resources.  By  focusing  on \nrural communities, the Project will improve the quality of life of a large proportion of poor people. \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  people  in \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  and  ADB\u2019s  human  development  and  poverty  reduction \nobjectives.  It  supports  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  and  planned  activities  (footnotes  16,  17,  18,  and  19)  to \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  water  sector.  The  Project  will  allow  ADB  to  play  a  key  role  in  the  joint \neffort  by  international  financing  agencies  to  assist  the  Government  in  combating  the  water \nshortage and drought problems in the poorest part of the country. \n \nB. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  and  health  conditions  in  the \n39. \nrural communities in Karakalpalstan and Khorezm. The Project will mitigate the ongoing effects \nof  the  drought  by  (i)  providing  safe  and  easily  accessible  water  supply  by  reinforcing  existing, \nand  developing  new,  sustainable  water  supply  facilities,  particularly  to  improve  the  service \ncoverage in rural areas; (ii) supporting water conservation measures, including improvements in \nO&M practices and public awareness, to minimize water wastage; and (iii) improving the health \nconditions  of  the  population  by  providing  sanitation  facilities  and  services  related  to  better \nhygiene practices. About 450,000 people in Karakalpakstan and about 250,000 in Khorezm, of \nwhom the majority are poor, will benefit from the Project.23 \n \n40. \nThe World Bank and ADB have coordinated closely during project preparation to ensure \nthat the Project and World Bank\u2019s ongoing project in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm complement \neach  other  and  support  the  Government\u2019s  drought  relief  program.24  As  a  result,  the  Project \nemphasizes securing water supply to the rural communities. The Project comprises three parts: \npotable  water  supply,  water  conservation  and  health  improvement,  and  capacity  building. \nPotable  water  supply  includes  the  development  of  bulk  pumping  and  trunk  mains,  while  local \nsupply includes the introduction of new facilities where none currently exists and rehabilitation of \nnonfunctional  supply  and  distribution  systems.  The  aim  is  to  expand  the  coverage  of  potable \nwater supply in rural districts from 12 percent minimum25 to 85 percent, reduce unaccounted for \nwater  losses  from  in  excess  of  50  percent  to  30  percent  of  supply,  increase  supply  efficiency, \nand  lower  unit  costs.  Water  conservation  includes  the  introduction  of  measures  such  as \nmetering and encouragement of reduced wastage. Health improvement includes upgrading the \nsanitation facilities of public institutions such as schools and clinics, and promoting water- and \nsanitation-related  health  awareness.  Capacity  building \nfor  community \ninteractive  project  management  and  institutional  strengthening  for  potable  water  resource \nmanagement.  The  objective  and  overall  scope  of  the  Project  are  in  accordance  with  the \nobjectives  of  ADB\u2019s  water  sector  policy,26  which  are  to  improve  and  expand  the  delivery  of \n\nincludes  support \n\n                                                 \n22 In support of this, ADB will provide further assistance in water resource management for agriculture (footnote 19) \n\nand will continue policy dialogue on water resource management at a subregional level. \n\n23 Covers about 25 percent of the population in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. \n24 The World Bank project was originally designed for urban water supply in the provincial capital cities of Nukus and \nUrgench and their vicinity. Due to the drought, some of the loan funds have been reallocated for improving rural \nwater  supply.  The  work,  involving  mainly  rehabilitation  of  existing  hand  pumps,  desalination  plants,  and  small \ntreatment plants, will cover about 15\u201320 percent of the need in the drought-affected areas. \n\n25 Some districts have a population coverage with access to potable water supply as low as 12 percent. \n26  ADB. 2000.

This  component  will  strengthen  bulk  water  pumping  and \ntransmission into the districts in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. It will achieve improved security \nof water supply for most of the population already connected to bulk supplies and provide good \nquality  water  to  new  areas  that  will  be  served  by  distribution  networks  developed  under  the \nProject. New pumping and the strengthening and extension of trunk mains will transmit water to \nareas without existing access to clean water. \n \nDeep  Boreholes  and  Treatment  Plants.  This  component  will  only  cover  districts  in \n42. \nKarakalpakstan  as  Khorezm  has  no  deep  aquifer  resources.  The  subprojects  will  involve \nproviding  new  deep  boreholes  and  associated  pumping  equipment,  reservoir  storage,  and \ndesalination equipment. This water will then be chlorinated and pumped or delivered by water \ntankers to distribution points that currently have no access to clean water.  \n \n43.  Water  Distribution  Centers.    The  Project  will  rehabilitate  existing,  and  construct  new, \nWDCs  in  various  districts  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  The  selection  of  the  districts  and \nsettlements  will  be  undertaken  at  the  start  of  the  Project  following  subproject  selection  and \nprioritization  procedures.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  securing  the  existing  distribution  of  good \nquality  water,  and  expanding  or  adding  new  supplies  where  appropriate.  The  subprojects  will \ninclude the rehabilitation of approximately 20 existing WDCs and the provision of about 26 new \nones. Each WDC will comprise service reservoir storage, disinfection, metering, pumping, and \ndistribution network. The existing distribution network will be reviewed for efficiency of operation, \nand be upgraded where necessary. \n \nOperational  Equipment  and  Materials.  This  component  will  include  modernizing  the \n44. \nfacilities  for  the  agrovodokanals  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  Laboratory  sampling  and \ntesting  equipment  will  assist  in  water  quality  control;  trench  excavators,  mobile  compressors, \nand welding equipment will facilitate the repairing or laying of trunk mains; small tools and hand \nequipment  will  enable  good  maintenance  to  be  carried  out;  and  leakage  detection  equipment \nwill  assist  in  minimizing  network  losses.  The  provision  of  necessary  repair  and  maintenance \nfacilities at the agrovodokanals will also be covered under this component. \n\n \n2. \n\nPart B: Water Conservation and Health Improvement \n\n \n45.  Water Conservation and Demand Management. According to a study by MMS in 2000 \non  demand  management  and  loss  reduction  in  the  urban  areas  of  Nukus  and  Urgench, \nappropriate  repairs  to  distribution  mains  can  readily  achieve  a  20  percent  reduction  in  loss. \nLeakage control by replacing fragile and defective mains is therefore an important aspect of the \nProject. Use of water meters is another effective means to control the use of water. The Project \nwill assist with meter provision where local consumers agree. Other settlements and districts will \nbe  provided  with  a  minimum  of  bulk  metering  under  the  Project  but  with  the  intention  that  the \nbenefits  from  metered  consumption  will  encourage  many  other  users  to  have  meters  fitted  as \nsoon as they can be afforded. \n \nSanitation  and  Health  Awareness.  The  sanitation  subprojects  will  focus  on  providing \n46. \nsupport to rural communities that rely on public and private pit latrines. Upgrading of latrines at \npremises  of  institutions  such  as  kindergartens,  schools,  and  clinics  by  introducing  ventilated \n\n\f \n\n \n15\n\n \n\nimproved  pit  latrine  principles  and  of  associated  access  to  a  water  supply  will  bring  both \npractical benefits and will raise the awareness and understanding of good hygiene practice. At \nselected  village  centers,  individual  ventilated  improved  pit  latrines  will  be  constructed,  through \nconsultation with rural assemblies and women\u2019s committees, as demonstration units to enable \nthe  people  to  understand  both  how  to  construct  such  latrines  and  the  benefits  accruing.  The \nlinkage  between  good  hygiene  practice  and  health  will  be  explained  in  printed  and  broadcast \nmaterial. \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Capacity Building  \n\nto  participate \n\n \n47. \nInstitutional  Development  Program.  To  strengthen  existing  institutional  capacity  and \nto  improve  service  delivery,  a  training  program,  social  development  measures,  and  consulting \nservices  for  institutional  development  and  project  management  support  will  be  provided.  The \ntraining program will improve the skills of staff of local governments, agrovodokanals, and rural \nassemblies  to  efficiently  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  systems.  Training  and  other \ncapacity  building  will  include  specific  initiatives  to  (i)  upgrade  the  computerized  accounting \nsystem for financial management of the total operation by introducing new software; (ii) provide \ntraining  on  water  supply  management;  (iii)  provide  training  on  operational  management, \nparticularly  aimed  at  asset  management;  and  (iv)  initiate  a  public  awareness  campaign  to \nencourage willingness to pay. \n \n48. \nSocial development measures to improve the distribution and penetration of benefits will \nbe provided in the form of education and awareness initiatives to support the overall goals and \nobjectives of provision. These will include (i) provision of demonstration ventilated improved pit \nlatrines  at  local  centers;  (ii)  public  health  awareness  campaigns  run  by  women  and  NGOs  to \nenable  the  full  benefits  of  improved  drinking  water  supply  and  good  hygiene  facilities  to  be \nrealized; and (iii) community participation and consumer rights awareness programs to improve \nthe  capacity  of  consumers \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement. These will be implemented with the support of CBOs and NGOs, and will include \nthe rural assemblies in project design and implementation.  \n \n49. \nin \nimplementing  the  Project  by  providing  project  management  support  to  local  governments  and \nagrovodokanals.  The  consulting  services  will  also  involve  socioeconomic  surveys,  community \nconsultations, and participation in project implementation with the support of CBOs and NGOs. \nThe  services  will  cover  subproject  development,  procurement  activities,  financial  management \nand  monitoring,  implementation  of  the  training  program,  support  to  social  development \nmeasures,  supervision  of  implementation,  and  quality  control  of  construction  of  the  physical \ncomponents of the Project. \n \nC. \n \n50. \nDrought  in  the  regions  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  has  highlighted  an  already \ndisastrous  situation  whereby  insufficient  raw  water  exists  to  support  the  needs  of  both \nagriculture use and human consumption. Water shortage in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm has \nbeen  largely  a  result  of  excessive  use  of  water  for  agriculture,  which  accounts  for  about  95 \npercent of the water produced (paras. 6, 7, 33 and 38). This issue, which requires interregional \ncooperation,  is  being  undertaken  at  the  Government  level  and  supported  by  international \nin  regional  water  resource \ndevelopment  agencies \nmanagement  and  changes  in  agricultural  practices  (paras.  9,  24,  and  25).  The  focus  of  this \nProject  is  to  contribute  to  longer-term  potable  water  supply  and  to  strengthen  the  institutional \n\nProject  Management.  Project  management  consulting  services  will  assist \n\nTechnical Justification \n\nthrough  assistance \n\nincluding  ADB \n\nin  project \n\n\f \n\n \n16\n\n \n\ncapacity  for  water  supply  management.  The  drying  of  the  Amudarya  River  has  resulted  in  a \nlarge proportion of the population having to resort to alternative and unsafe sources. Short-term \nassistance with the provision of hand pumps and boreholes cannot be relied upon in the future \nas  nonreplenished  resources  are  exhausted.  The  Project  seeks  to  develop  alternative  potable \nwater  resources  and  introduce  demand  management,  which  will  solve  the  long-term  needs  of \nthe population while supporting the short- and medium-term programs of the Government. The \nproposed  technology  is  the  most  cost-effective  and  will  benefit  the  rural  population  with  the \nprovision  of  a  secure  and  wholesome  supply  of  water.  The  project  cost  estimate  of  less  than \n$100/capita is within the normal bounds of rural water supply projects funded by ADB. In parallel \nwith water supply will be the improvement of sanitary hygiene facilities at public centers where \nchildren  in  particular  will  understand  the  advantages  and  benefits  of  clean  toilets  and  good \nhygiene  practice.  The  high  incidence  of  water-related  health  problems  in  the  regions  will  be \ndiminished  and  with  it  the  direct  costs  of  treatment  and  the  indirect  loss  of  opportunity  costs. \nThe introduction and application of modern techniques for the efficient management and O&M \nof  water  resources  and  potable  water  supply  systems  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to \nassist in functional sustainability. \n \nD. \n \n51. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $65.0 million equivalent (at February 2002 prices), \nof which $37.0 million or 56.9 percent is the foreign exchange cost and $28.0 million equivalent \nor 43.1 percent the local currency cost.

Price  contingencies  are  calculated  at  purchasing \n\npower parity using escalation rates of 2.4 percent per annum for foreign costs and 20 percent for local costs. \n\n\f \n\n \n17\n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nE. \n \n52. \nThe Government of Uzbekistan will provide $27.0 million equivalent counterpart funding \nto the Project and has requested a loan of $38.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the Project.27 The ADB loan will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and 3.6 \npercent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  local  currency  financing  is  required  to  fund  the  entire \ncapacity  building  and  project  management  component  to  ensure  that  the  institutional \nstrengthening objective will be achieved. The loan represents 58.5 percent of the total cost. The \nADB  cost-sharing  limit  under  the  Graduation  Policy  for  Uzbekistan  for  2002  is  40  percent. \nHowever, crop failure and the drop in the price of cotton, the country\u2019s main export earnings, in \nthe last few years, has resulted in a decline in economic performance. Gross domestic product \ngrowth  decreased  from  4.3  percent  in  1998  to  3.8  percent  in  2001;  gross  national  income \ndropped  from  $870  in  1998  to  $540  in  2001;  and  debt/export  ratio  of  goods  and  services \nincreased from 94 percent in 1998 to 140 percent in 2001.28 Sixty percent counterpart funding \nrepresents  an  extraordinarily  high  financial  burden  for  the  Government  whose  revenues, \nparticularly  foreign  exchange,  have  suffered  significant  erosion  due  to  the  impact  of  transition \nand the drought in the last two years. The fiscal constraint is expected to continue in the next \nfew years. Increasing ADB\u2019s cost-sharing from 40 to 58.5 percent is required to ensure timely \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  which  is  essential  to  provide  basic  potable  water  supply  to  the \nrural  population  that  are  suffering  from  the  drought.29  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.75  percent  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  1  percent,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under the LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these \nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.

The exact amount is being determined by the Ministry of Finance in Paris. The indicative \namount for 2002 is about $2.0 million. Upon confirmation from the French Government, the ADB loan amount may \nbe reduced accordingly. \n\n28 Sources: World Bank and Government of Uzbekistan estimates. \n29 The financing arrangement for the parallel World Bank project in Karakapakstan and Khorezm is 64 percent from \nWorld Bank, 25.1 percent from the Kuwait Fund and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany, and 10.9 percent \nfrom the Government of Uzbekistan. The financing arrangement for a recently approved urban water supply project  \nin  Samarkand  and  Bukhara,  which  are  richer  cities  and  better  able  to  guarantee  counterpart  funding,  is  64.5 \npercent from the World Bank (of which half is from the International Development Association), 14.5 percent from \nthe  Government  of  Switzerland,  and  21  percent  from  the  Government.  The  approved  World  Bank  country \nassistance  strategy  for  2002\u20132004  anticipates  50  percent  of  funding  from  the  International  Development \nAssociation. \n\n\f \n\n \n18\n\n \n\nThe Executing Agency \n\nF. \n \n53.  MMS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  have  overall  responsibility  for  project \ncoordination  and  implementation,  and  liaison  with  ADB  and  with  other  government  ministries \nand  departments.  MMS  is  one  of  the  most  senior  ministries  within  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan  and  is  responsible  for  a  range  of  departmental  functions.  Within  MMS  is  a \ndepartment  for  rural  infrastructure  development,  the  major  function  of  which  is  directed  to \nimproving  water  supply  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  MMS  is  the  coordinator  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Aral  Sea  Program  and  is  the  executing  agency  for,  among  others,  the  World \nBank  project  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm.  It  has  in-house  technical  capacity  together  with \nconsiderable  experience  in  dealing  with  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  water  supply  networks. \nMMS  is  also  well  positioned  to  coordinate  the  activities  of  the  proposed  Project  with  other \nexternally financed projects in the sector. \n \nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nExecution and Coordination  \n\n \n54. \nTo  ensure  close  coordination  of  the  Project  with  the  ongoing  World  Bank  project  and \nother externally financed activities in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, the existing interministerial \nproject steering committee (PSC) for the World Bank project will also be responsible for project \ncoordination and policy guidance for the proposed Project. The deputy minister of MMS chairs \nthe  PSC  and  members  include  representatives  from  the  Department  of  Foreign  Economic \nRelations and Investment, Ministry of Finance, UCSA, and the governments of Karakalpakstan \nand  Khorezm.  The  PSC  is  responsible  for  (i)  setting  policy  guidelines  for  improving  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  coordinating  at  the  policy  level  with  other  ministries,  agencies  and  other \ndonors  in  the  project  area,  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  annual  implementation  plans,  (iv)  \nmonitoring  the  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  (v)  coordinating  procurement  activities \nand awarding of contacts. The project implementation structure is in Appendix 5. \n \n55. \nA project management unit (PMU) within MMS and project implementation units (PIUs) \nin Karakalpakstan and Khorezm will be established prior to loan effectiveness.30 The PIUs will \nbe  set  under  each  of  the  local  governments  to  manage  the  subprojects  and  the  various \nagencies involved at the local level. The PMU will include a full-time manager and two full-time \nstaff to manage and coordinate the work of the two PIUs, provide technical support to PSC, as \nwell  as  coordinate  with  the  World  Bank  project  implementation  unit  in  MMS.  The  PIUs  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  detailed  implementation  activities  among  the  various  agencies \ninvolved  at  the  local  level  (e.g.  UCSA  branches,  TCSAs,  agrovodokanals,  local  governments, \nand the World Bank project implementation units at the local level) and will report to the PMU. \nResponsibilities of the PIUs include financial management of project and subproject accounts, \nprocurement  activities,  and  local  community  liaison.  Each  of  the  PIUs  will  have  a  full-time \nmanager  and  four  to  five  full-time  staff.  The  trunk  main  agencies  and  agrovodokanals  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day project implementation activities and will report, through the PIUs, \nto  the  PMU.  The  agencies  and  agrovodokanals  will  be  responsible  for  activities  such  as \nconstruction supervision, O&M of assets, and collection of tariffs. The implementation structure \nand specific roles and responsibilities are summarized in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n30 The remuneration of key PMU and PIU staff who will be recruited as term employees will be included under the \n\nProject. Identification, selection, and remuneration levels of these key staff will be subjected to ADB approval. \n\n\f \n\n \n19\n\n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Formulation and Approval  \n\n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  cover  rural  communities  that  lack  basic  potable  water  supply  services. \nSubprojects  under  Part  A,  Potable  Water  Supply,  will  be  identified,  appraised,  prioritized, \ndesigned,  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  in  Appendix  6.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  the  settlements  and  districts  suffering  the  greatest  hardship  from \nthe  effects  of  the  drought  will  be  given  the  highest  priority.  Subprojects  with  a  total  cost \nexceeding  $200,000  and  those  having  social  and  environmental  issues  will  require  ADB \napproval.  The  Government  will  include  detailed  information  on  the  scope,  coverage,  and \nbeneficiaries  of  these  subprojects  in  the  progress  reports  that  will  be  submitted  to  ADB. \nSubprojects  under  Part  B,  Water  Conservation  and  Health  Improvement,  will  also  be  selected \nand appraised in accordance with the criteria in Appendix 6. The Government will ensure that \nadequate  local  budget  exists  for  the  proper  maintenance  of  the  facilities  provided,  and  that \nwherever  a  piped  water  supply  is  provided  under  the  Project,  improvements  to  sanitation \nfacilities at all kindergartens, schools, and clinics will be provided. Since each of these sanitation \nsubprojects is unlikely to cost more than $200,000, no prior approval by the ADB is required. \n \n57. \nEach subproject feasibility study will include a financing plan showing the percentage of \nthe  estimated  subproject  cost  to  be  financed  by  the  loan  and  counterpart  funds  from  the \nGovernment.  The  feasibility  study  should  also  include  social  and  environmental  impact \nassessments. If any subproject involves resettlement, the PMU in coordination with the PIUs will \nprepare  a  resettlement  action  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement  and \nrelevant local guidelines. The plan will include assurances that land acquisition and resettlement \nwill  be  undertaken  and  affected  people  will  be  compensated  following  this  plan.  The \nGovernment will provide a copy of the plan to ADB before approval of the relevant subproject. \nAs  part  of  each  subproject  appraisal,  the  PMU  in  coordination  with  the  PIUs  will  carry  out  an \nenvironmental  screening.  Where  appropriate,  an  initial  environmental  examination  and,  if \nrequired,  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Requirement and relevant local procedures.    \n \n\n3. \n\nBudgetary Support and Channeling of Funds  \n\n \nThe  PMU,  under  the  supervision  of  the  PSC,  will  undertake  central  procurement, \n58. \nincluding the capacity building component and the packages for materials and equipment. The \nPIU will undertake procurement of all other goods and services, and transfer the physical assets \nto  the  agrovodokanals.  Counterpart  funds  will  be  channeled  to  the  implementing  agencies \nthrough  regular  budgetary  allocations.  Exemptions  from  taxes  and  duties  will  also  be \nrecognized.  The  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  either  through  reimbursement  to  the  PMU \nand  PIUs,  or  through  direct  payment  to  the  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants.  The \nagrovodokanals  will  receive  revenue  from  tariffs  and  charges  to  consumers,  as  well  as \nsubsidies from the Government for O&M.  \n \n59. \nAt  the  start  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  help  the  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm \nadministrations formulate the draft project expenditures for all activities, with estimates for each \nyear of project implementation. These budgets will be reviewed and updated every six months \nand  approved  by  the  PMU  before  implementation.  Expenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by \nthe implementing agencies, PIUs, and PMU. The PMU will approve and supervise all drawdown \narrangements. The PMU will be responsible for compiling project expenditures based on its own \nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  the  PIUs.  It  will  report  project \nexpenditures to MMS and the PSC, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis, with quarterly and \nannual summaries. \n\n\f \n\n \n20\n\n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n \n60. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  sections  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  to \nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  for  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed \ncontracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are  discovered.  The  anticorruption \nprovisions  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  were  discussed.  The  project \nimplementation \ninclude  assistance \nmanagement  consulting  services \narrangements,  including  internal  auditing  procedures.  The  international  project  management \nconsultants  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  procedures  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic \nconsultants,  increasing  transparency,  and  providing  for  equal  opportunity  competition.  The \nconsultants will help to (i) strengthen the financial management system of the local governments \nand  concerned  agencies,  (ii)  conduct  training  to  promote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to \ninternational  accounting  standards  and  auditing  procedures,  and  (iii)  draft  procurement  and \nbidding documents to strengthen the ability to detect fraud and corruption. The Government is \nincreasingly  concerned  with  governance  issues  and  has  committed  to  (i)  create  a  strong \nmechanism of checks and balances, (ii) strengthen nongovernment and public associations, (iii) \nreinforce the legal basis for reforms, (iv) support the gradual transfer of government powers of \nstate  bodies  to  citizens\u2019  bodies  for  self-government  and  other  nongovernment  agencies,  (v) \nencourage decentralization, and (vi) ensure the independence of the judiciary.31 \n \n\nto  strengthen \n\nthe \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Schedule  \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over three years and is expected to commence in the \n61. \nbeginning of October 2002 and be completed by the end of September 2005. To ensure rapid \nprogress,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  a  time-bound  implementation  schedule  with  critical \nmilestones. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. With the preparatory work in \nprogress,  and  design  for  major  structures  already  completed,  the  implementation  schedule  is \nconsidered to be realistic. \n \n\n6. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n62. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  over  $1.0 \nmillion and contracts for goods and related services above $500,000 will be undertaken through \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Civil works contracts valued at $1.0 million or less \nwill be carried out under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Contracts for \ngoods  and  services  valued  at  or  under  $500,000  will  be  procured  following  international \nshopping procedures except for supply contracts with a value of less than $100,000 equivalent, \nwhich  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  The  proposed  procurement  packages  and  their \nestimated costs are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n\n7. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n63. \nThe  Project  will  require  consulting  services  in  the  fields  of  potable  water  resource \nmanagement, project management, water supply and sanitation, procurement, health and public \nawareness  education,  financial  and  accounting  advice,  poverty  reduction  and  community \nparticipation, and community-based water resource management. Consulting services will assist \n\n                                                 \n31  Resolution No. 296 of the Cabinet of Ministers, 10 June 1999. \n\n\f \n\n \n21\n\n \n\nin \n\nin  (i)  developing  and  supporting  the  institutional  development  program  on  potable  water \nresource management, information campaigns to promote water conservation, and willingness \nto  pay  for  water  usage;  (ii)  selecting  subprojects;  (iii)  preparing  detailed  feasibility  and \nengineering design studies, including socioeconomic, technical, and environmental surveys; (iv) \npreparing  contract  packages  and  documents  and  procurement  activities;  (v)  evaluating  project \nactivities;  (vi)  supervising,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  project  activities;  (vii)  supporting  the \nmanagement  and  activities  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs;  (viii)  helping  staff  prepare  loan  withdrawal \napplications  and  supporting  documents;  (ix)  mobilizing  community  participation \nthe \ndevelopment  and  ownership  of  subprojects;  (x)  introducing  the  public  to  the  concepts  and \nimportance  of  minimizing  water  losses/wastage  and  of  water  use  in  personal  hygiene  with \nlinkages  to  improved  health;  and  (xi)  maintaining  accurate  and  sufficient  project  accounting \nrecords in accordance with international accounting standards. A total of 254 person-months (32 \nperson-months  international  and  222  person-months  domestic)  of  consulting  services  are \nrequired.  The  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  MMS  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  based  on  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method, \nand  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational  consultants  will  contract  with  suitable  NGOs  and  CBOs  for  the  design  and \nimplementation of subprojects. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 9. \n \n64. \nThe  institutional  development  program  will  include  training  of  existing  and  new \ngovernment  and  concerned  agencies\u2019  staff  on  water  supply  management  and  O&M  of  water \nsupply  schemes.  The  program  will  focus  on  introducing  the  agrovodokanals  to  water  demand \nmanagement techniques and the consumer-response management of supplying water such that \npublic  confidence  and  willingness  of  the  population  to  pay  an  economic  charge  for  water  is \nincreased.  The  program  involves  (i)  providing  project  information  to  customers;  (ii)  providing \ngood  quality  water  as  agreed;  (iii)  developing  capabilities,  including  planning,  engineering, \nfinancial,  accounting,  billing,  tariff  setting  and  collection,  and  operations;  (iv)  effectively \nresponding  to  problems  and  complaints;  (v)  establishing  and  ensuring  continued  attention  to \npreventive maintenance programs; and (vi) carefully monitoring system performance.    \n \n65. \nThe PMU and PIUs, in coordination with the health departments in Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm and with assistance from the consultants, will work with NGOs to develop hygiene and \nhealth  awareness  programs  for  the  health  departments  and  CBOs,  such  as  the  rural \nassemblies. The programs will include (i) communication campaigns to educate the population \non the causes, effects, and prevention of waterborne and related diseases; (ii) specification and \nstandard  setting  for  health  awareness  campaigns  in  areas  such  as  maintenance  of  sanitation \nfacilities, food storage and preparation, and personal hygiene in houses and small businesses; \nand  (iii)  communication  and  training  programs  for  local  NGO  staff  and  volunteers,  including \nwomen\u2019s  and  youth  groups  to  implement  the  programs  with  the  community  in  the  project \ncommunities. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursements \n\n \n66. \nThe  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections, \nrequesting  budgetary  allocations  for  the  counterpart  funds,  collecting  supporting  documents, \npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with the ADB Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  Project,  an  imprest  account  in \ndollars  will  be  established  at  the  PMU  level  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible for timely release of imprest funds to the PIUs as needed. The imprest account will \nbe established only after the project-financed financial management adviser is fielded and ADB \nconfirms  the  establishment  of  sufficient  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  at  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n22\n\n \n\nPMU  and  the  PIUs.  The  initial  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  $250,000.  The  imprest \naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  with  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government \nand ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances from \nthe imprest account. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports  \n\n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and \n67. \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  maintained.  The  PIUs  will  maintain  separate \nproject  accounts,  in  coordination  with  the  PMU,  which  will  prepare  the  project  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements,  including  for  the  imprest  account  and  records  of  the  statement  of \nexpenditures. Project accounts and financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of \nsuch  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  nine  months \nafter the close of each fiscal year. All such reports and statements will be submitted in English. \nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  finance  the  costs  related  to  the  annual  auditing  from  the  loan \nproceeds.  MMS  and  the  PIUs  were  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  new  policy  on  submission  of  audited \nfinancial statements and the strict penalties for noncompliance. The PMU and ADB may review \nand audit these records on a random basis. \n \n68. \nThe  PIUs,  in  coordination  with  the  PMU,  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the \nimplementation  of  project-funded  activities.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB \nand  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  progress  made  against  established  targets,  problems \nencountered  during  the  quarter,  steps  taken  and  steps  proposed  to  resolve  the  problems, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be undertaken during the next quarter. \nA  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared  within  three  months  of  project  completion.  All \nreports will be submitted in English. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\na. \n\nAnnual Operation Plans and Financial Review \n\n \n69. \nTo  facilitate  project  implementation,  MMS  will  prepare  by  30  September  2002,  and \nthereafter by 30 September of each year, an operation plan for the next fiscal year. The plan will \ninclude (i) proposed budgetary allocations for subproject works, and specifically, the allocation \nof sufficient counterpart funds from the central Government and other sources for timely project \nimplementation;  (ii)  status  of  policy  actions;  and  (iii)  financing  plan  for  the  project  activities  for \nthe  succeeding  year.  The  plan  will  confirm  that  the  Government  has  allocated  an  adequate \nbudget for financing project implementation and recurrent costs. \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System \n\n \n70. \nThe  PIUs  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  evaluate  the \ndelivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued. The PMU, with the assistance \nof the consultants, will develop comprehensive performance monitoring procedures and plans in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s handbook within three months after loan effectiveness. The PIUs, with \nguidance  from  the  Uzbekistan  Resident  Mission,  will  carry  out  project  performance  monitoring \nactivities,  including  establishing  benchmarks,  collecting  information,  monitoring  benefits,  and \nevaluating social and environmental impacts. Data collection will be carried out prior to the start \nof the physical implementation of the Project and in conjunction with community participation. It \n\n\f \n\n \n23\n\n \n\nwill  then  continue  on  a  regular  basis  during  project  implementation  until  three  months  after \nproject  completion.  The  results  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project  progress  and  completion \nreports. \n \n\nc. \n\nAnnual and Midterm Review \n\n \n71. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  project  reviews  to  assess \nprogress, identify constraints, and agree on strategies for resolving such constraints. More than \none  review  per  year  is  expected  for  the  first  year.  In  addition,  ADB  and  the  Government  will \ncarry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  in  the  second  year  of  project  implementation \n(2003/04).  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  midterm  review  is  informed  of  any  policy  or \nimplementation  changes  affecting  the  local  governments  and  the  water  supply  sector,  and  if \nnecessary,  recommend  changes  in  design  and  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i) \nreview the scope, design, and implementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes \nneeded  since  the  time  of  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against \nproject  indicators;  (iv)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  identify \nthe  design  or \nproblems  and  constraints  and, \nimplementation arrangements. \n \n\nif  necessary,  recommend  changes \n\nin \n\n11. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n72. \nDue  to  the  urgency  of  the  situation  prevailing  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  the \nGovernment has asked ADB to approve advance action for the establishment of the PMU and \nthe  two  PIUs,  as  well  as  for  consultant  recruitment.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that \napproval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the \nProject. In the event the Project is approved, ADB will finance up to $1,000,000 on a retroactive \nbasis for all expenditures incurred after 4 February 2002 for these project activities. \n \n\n12. \n\nCommunity Participation \n\n \n73. \nA participatory approach will be adopted to select and formulate the subprojects during \nimplementation.  A  particular  focus  of  the  participatory  program  will  be  on  meeting  and \nprioritizing the needs of the poor. The capacity building component will provide training for local \nNGOs and CBOs to participate in managing and maintaining the subproject facilities in the long \nterm. \n \nThe  main  selection  criteria  for  NGO  participation  in  the  Project  will  be  (i)  a  well-\n74. \nestablished  track  record  of  activities  and  social  networks  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  (ii) \nexperience  in  public  health,  (iii)  experience  in  mounting  publicity  campaigns,  (iv)  evidence  of \ninvolvement  of  women  and  people  of  all  ethnic  origins  in  the  project  area,  (v)  experience  in \nkeeping  accounts  and  making  progress  reports,  (vi)  willingness  to  receive  specialist  training \nfrom national or international NGOs, and (vii) ability to commit the needed staff resources full-\ntime for the required duration of the Project. \n \n\n13. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n \n75. \nInfrastructure  development  requires  supply  of  equipment,  materials,  and  contracting \nservices.  A  strong  support  industry  is  an  essential  element  for  good  utility  performance.  A \nprivate  support  industry  for  the  water  supply  sector,  especially  rural  water  supply,  is  evolving \nonly slowly in Uzbekistan. Most services are delivered through state agencies, publicly owned \nself-financing  organizations,  or  recently  privatized  companies  that  provide  similar  services  as \n\n\f \n\n \n24\n\n \n\nwere  offered  by  the  former  state-owned  enterprises,  institutes,  and  ministries.  Greater  private \nsector  participation  will  result  in  competition  that  allows  utilities  and  consumers  to  choose  the \nbest  contract  in  terms  of  quality  and  cost.  The  Project  will  provide  opportunities  for  the \ndevelopment of (i) a diversified private consulting capacity by contracting research and design \ninstitutes  that  are  privatized  or  operate  on  market  principles;  (ii)  a  responsive  and  efficient \ndomestic industry to supply quality equipment and materials by procuring from privatized state \nequipment manufacturers and material suppliers; (iii) civil works contractors that are capable of \nproviding  quality  services  by  contracting  the  privatized  state  civil  works  contractors;  (iv)  small-\nscale  enterprises  that  can  offer  construction  and  O&M  services;  (v)  NGOs  that  can  help \ncommunities  maintain  the  infrastructure  facilities;  and  (vi)  local  consulting  businesses,  survey \ncompanies, and individuals. \n \n\n14. \n\nOperation and Maintenance  \n\n \n76. \nThe intention of the Project is that all investment should be owned and managed by the \nlocal  operating  organizations.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  technical  capabilities  and \noperational  practices  of  the  agrovodokanals,  and  will  provide  technical  training  and  essential \nplant  and  equipment  for  these  purposes.  Maintenance  practices  will  be  established  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  the  capital  assets  and  maximize  efficiency  of  operation.  System  performance \nwill  be  monitored  and  procedures  for  corrective  action  will  be  set  up.  The  beneficiary \ncommunities will participate in the decision process to the degree to which they are required or \nprepared  to  support  local  distribution  and  assume  responsibility  for  their  local  supply  network, \nwhich  will  include  metering,  either  bulk  or  individual.  This  mobilization  of  local  community \norganizations to nominate their particular water delivery requirements and thus accept a degree \nof  ownership  and  responsibility  for  the  operation  and  performance  of  the  same  will  support \nsustainability of the project facilities and services. \n \n\n15. \n\nCost Recovery  \n\n \n77. \nThe Government agreed that the agrovodokanals should prioritize O&M expenditure to \nensure  that  existing  and  future  service  delivery  is  sustainable.  Based  on  the  financial  data  of \nagrovodokanals, current tariff levels and overall revenues are low, and revenue is insufficient to \ncarry  out  repair  and  maintenance  of  the  existing  network  or  extend  services  to  more  remote \nvillages. Existing tariffs cover only about 30 to 40 percent of O&M cost. Tariff collection is about \n30  percent  of  the  billed  amounts  and  unaccounted  for  water  is  over  50  percent  of  supply.  To \nenable  the  agrovodokanals  to  raise  and  collect  tariffs  that  will  sufficiently  cover  their  O&M \nexpenditures, the existing service levels will have to be improved to a satisfactory level, both in \nquantity and quality of water provided to the rural communities. Given the economic difficulties \nfacing  the  rural  population  in  the  project  area,  tariffs  cannot  be  increased  in  the  short  term  to \nachieve full cost recovery of O&M and capital investment for the Project. The proposed stepped \ntariff, with a lifeline tariff for the lowest income population, will likely initially achieve only partial \nrecovery of O&M cost. Full cost recovery of O&M cost and partial recovery of the project capital \ncost  are  targeted  within  10  years  of  project  completion.  To  ensure  sustainability  of  the  project \nfacilities,  the  Government  has  assured  that  the  tariff  revenue  will  be  prioritized  for  O&M.  The \ncapacity building component of the Project will provide training on financial management of the \nagrovodokanals.  Through  improved  service  delivery  and  customer  willingness  to  pay,  the \nfinancial viability of the agrovodokanals is expected to slowly improve. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nH. \n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n \n25\n\n \n\n \nThe Project is intended to implement a series of urgent schemes to improve availability \n78. \nof  potable  water  supplies,  assist  in  good  management  practices,  and  support  rural  sanitation. \nThe  overall  impact  will  be  a  substantial  improvement  in  public  health  and  quality  of  life,  while \nmaintaining  or  improving  the  quality  of  water  resources.  Being  a  category  B  project,  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  undertaken  using  criteria  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (Appendix  10).  None  of  the  components  will \ncause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  based  on  the  screening  of  possible \nenvironmental consequences using ADB checklists. \n \n79. \nThe project physical activities involve rehabilitating or constructing new pumping stations \nand  trunk  mains,  drilling  new  deep  boreholes  and  introducing  desalination  equipment, \nrehabilitating  existing  and  providing  new  WDCs,  strengthening  distribution  networks  to  rural \ncommunities, and improving sanitation facilities in education and medical establishments. These \nactivities will be undertaken largely in rural areas, away from any densely populated localities. \nThe major permanent works will be either underground, i.e., pipelines, or in existing compounds \ndedicated for water supply facilities, i.e., water treatment and distribution centers. The new land \nrequired for WDCs will not involve resettlement of the population and no loss of crop production \nwill result from the Project, since surplus, uncultivated land is not in short supply.  \n \n80. \nSome  sites  of  historic  and  cultural  interest  are  located  in  the  area,  although  none  of \nknown  ecological  importance.  The  design  of  each  subproject  will  take  account  of  the  known \nsites, if any, and will ensure that they remain protected and free from any deleterious effect of \nthe  project  work.  The  impact  of  construction  activities  will  be  limited  in  duration  and  extent, \ntraffic  flow  and  problems  of  noise  and  dust  from  construction  activities  will  be  temporary,  and \nsuitable  mitigation  measures  will  be  taken  to  minimize  these  impacts.  All  major  or  minor  pipe \nroutes  will  be  away  from  habitation  and  will  follow  the  alignment  of  existing  infrastructure \nservices such as roads, gas, electricity, and telecommunications. Appropriate arrangements will \nbe  put  in  place  for  the  safe  disposal  of  sewage  sludge  from  latrine  blocks.  Overall,  adverse \nenvironmental impacts of the Project are insignificant as compared with the benefits accruing. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Measures \n\n \nA social analysis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions and \n81. \nHandbook  for  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Projects  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  the \nstatus  of  water  supply  and  the  demands  of  the  rural  population  living  in  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm.  Views  of  the  community  concerned  were  obtained  regarding  their  potable  water \nneeds  and  willingness  to  pay  fees  for  the  services.  The  results  of  the  social  analysis  are \nincorporated in project formulation as outlined in Appendix 11. The social analysis indicates that \nthe potential beneficiaries show a high level of interest and support for the Project. To ensure \nthat  the  Project  benefits  will  be  affordable  to  the  target  population,  tariff  increases  will  be \nimplemented in a staged manner with regular reviews taking into consideration the income level \nof the rural population. Project implementation does not require any resettlement. \n \n82. \nA random survey of the target population was conducted to yield information pertinent to \ndesigning aspects of the Project that would address the needs of the poor. The findings of the \nsurvey  provide  a  socioeconomic  profile  (Appendix  11),  which  provides  the  basis  for  including \nspecific social measures. Such elements are mechanisms to ensure that all users, particularly \n\n\f \n\n \n26\n\n \n\nthe poor and women, will be able to participate in project implementation, receive the benefits of \nimproved  water  supply,  and  are  willing  and  can  afford  to  pay  for  the  water  services.  The \ninvolvement  of  rural  assemblies  and  related  support  for  their  activities  is  consistent  with  the \ncultural tradition of community participation, embodied in the local committee system. Women\u2019s \ninvolvement  will  be  facilitated  through  the  existing  rural  assembly  system  where  women \ncommittees  are  represented.  These  features  are  expected  to  serve  as  the  keystone  for  (i) \ninteraction  between  service  providers  with  consumers;  (ii)  coordination  of  line  ministries \nresponsible for promoting water conservation awareness, drinking water, and health standards; \nand (iii) provision of a voice for the target population to alert the responsible authorities to their \nparticular  needs  or  problems.  In  short,  these  built-in  features  are  socially  sound  and  will \nencourage stakeholder ownership and accountability for project implementation. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n\n \nA. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n \n83. \nThe Project will improve potable water supplies to rural communities in Karakalpakstan \nand Khorezm that are currently deprived of basic water needs as a result of water shortage in \nthe  region  that  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  drought.  The  Project  will  (i)  increase  rural  water \nsupply service coverage; (ii) generate efficiency gains, reducing distribution leakage, and water \nand  electricity  costs;  (iii)  improve  cost  recovery  through  better  service  delivery  and  customer \nservice;  (iv)  reduce  natural  resource  depletion;  and  (v)  improve  public  health  by  reducing  the \nincidence of waterborne diseases. \n \n84. \nThe economic benefits identified were based on two sample subprojects, one in Bozatau \ndistrict  in  Karakalpakstan  and  the  other  in  Koshkupir  district  in  Khorezm.  The  benefits  reflect \nsignificant  poverty  reduction  and  improvement  in  living  conditions,  in  particular,  health  and \nhygiene  of  the  rural  population  of  whom  over  60  percent  is  poor.  Nonincremental  benefits \ninclude  (i)  resource  cost  savings  from  customers  obtaining  water  from  other  sources,  (ii) \navailability  of  unaccounted  for  water  to  users  after  improvement  of  facilities  under  the  Project, \nand (iii) health benefits. Incremental benefits include additional water sales to meet suppressed \nor increased demand of existing customers and additional sales to new customers who will be \nconnected to the piped network, based on customers\u2019 willingness to pay.   \n \nResource cost savings or time savings to collect water is a major economic benefit of the \n85. \nProject.  According  to  the  socioeconomic  survey,  60  percent  of  the  households  indicated  that \ndue to the water shortage in the region, which has been further intensified by the drought, they \nhave  to  walk  to  faraway  wells  to  find  water.32  At  least  2.5  hours  are  spent  each  day  in  the \nsummer and at least 1.5 hours in the winter to collect water. Unaccounted for water is currently \nat  over  50  percent  of  the  total  water  produced.  Improvement  to  the  water  supply  facilities  and \nbetter leakage control under the Project is expected to reduce the unaccounted for water to 30 \npercent.  Water  resource  conservation  benefits  will  be  achieved  through  water  demand \nmanagement  impacts  of  users  paying  cost-based  tariffs  and  reduced  water  wastage.  The \n\n                                                 \n32 Official data from the agrovodokanals indicate that about 73 percent of rural households in the sample subproject \ndistrict  of  Koshkupir  and  about  46  percent  in  the  sample  district  of  Bozatau  do  not  have  water  connections  and \nhave to obtain and carry water from other sources. Of those households with piped water connections, supply is \nscheduled with the majority receiving water for only 2\u20133 hours per day. The consumption level is therefore low at \nabout  45  liters  per  day  per  household  or  less  than  10  liters  per  capita  per  day.  The  suppressed  demand  is  very \nhigh. \n\n\f \n\n \n27\n\n \n\nProject  will  also  bring  significant  health  benefits  from  improved  quantity  and  quality  of  water, \nimproved sanitation facilities, and better hygiene practices, thereby reducing the morbidity rate \nand costs of treatment of waterborne diseases of the rural population. \n \nThe  incremental  benefits  of  increased  sales  are  based  on  the  difference  between  the \n86. \ncurrent level of usage at less than 10 liters per capita per day (lcd) and the estimated increased \nconsumption to a minimum of 60 lcd as a result of the Project. This benefit is estimated using \nthe consumer\u2019s willingness to pay survey results. \n \n87. \nThe Project will also provide indirect economic benefits by training concerned agencies\u2019 \nstaff  in  technical  and  financial  management,  institutional  development,  and  local  community \ngovernance.  Other  benefits  cannot  be  quantified  but  will  accrue  in  general  terms  to  economic \ndevelopment  of  the  project  area  as  a  result  of  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation.  These \ninclude  increased  economic  activities  and  output  of  commerce  and  industry,  and  improved \noperations  of  institutions  such  as  schools  and  hospitals  that  require  secure  and  safe  water \nsupply.  \n \n88. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation was undertaken in constant 2002 \nprices  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  since  the  outputs  are  nontradable  in  nature. \nEconomic costs, excluding taxes and financial prices, are converted using factors of (i) 1.4 for \nthe  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF),33  and  (ii)  0.8  for  labor.  The  EIRRs  for  the  sample \nsubprojects in Bozatau district and Khoskupir district are 18.0 and 19.9 percent, exceeding the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be 12 percent. Switching values and \nsensitivity indicators were tested using the SERF at 2.1 and increase in capital and O&M cost \nby 40 percent. The subprojects were found to be economically viable under adverse cost-benefit \nscenarios. A summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n89. \nA  financial  appraisal  was  undertaken  for  each  sample  subproject,  comparing  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital;  and  the \naverage incremental cost with the average incremental revenue. Costs include capital costs in \nline  with  the  implementation  schedule,  operational  costs,  and  replacement  costs.  Estimates  of \nO&M costs consider improvements in efficiency, particularly in the use of electricity, volume of \nwater  produced,  and  specific  maintenance  requirements  for  the  facilities  created  under  the \nProject. Only additional costs resulting from the Project were included in the FIRR calculation. \nRevenue  from  direct  user  charges  is  at  an  assumed  collection  rate  of  65  percent.  This  is  a \nconsiderable improvement on the current collection rate, which is about 30 to 40 percent.  \n \n90. \nThe  FIRRs  for  the  sample  subprojects  in  Bozatau  and  Koshkupir  are  3.9  and  4.8 \npercent.  Both  exceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  which  is  about  2.1  percent,  \ndemonstrating that at proposed tariff levels the Project is financially viable. Switching values and \nsensitivity indicators were tested, and the subprojects were found to be financially viable under \nadverse cost and revenue scenarios. \n \n91. \nFinancial projections were prepared for the agrovodokanals for 2002 to 2025, the project \nperiod.  Existing  cash  flow  difficulties  are  expected  to  continue  during  project  implementation \nsince poor service delivery is one of the main reasons for low tariff collection. This should not \naffect  project  implementation  since  all  counterpart  funds  are  financed  by  the  central \n                                                 \n33 The SERF is calculated based on the official exchange rate of SUM693 and the commercial rate of SUM990 (as of \n\nFebruary 2002). Sensitivity analysis has assumed the SERF at 2.1 based on the market rate of SUM1,480. \n\n\f \n\n \n28\n\n \n\nGovernment  through  state  budget  allocations  and  project  assets  will  be  transferred  to  the \nagrovodokanals.  Currently,  the  Government  is  subsidizing  about  50  percent  of  the  O&M \nexpenses  of  the  agrovodokanals.  In  view  of  the  worsening  economic  situation  in  the  project \narea, the Government recognizes that the necessity of continuing to subsidize operation of the \nagrovodokanals to ensure sustainable service delivery. Once service delivery improves and new \ncharging  arrangements  and  tariff  increases  are  in  place  in  2006,  the  financial  performance  of \nthe  agrovodokanals  will  improve  and  key  ratios  will  satisfy  requirements.  The  operating \nexpenditure to income ratio will be below 1.0 and the current asset to current liability ratio will be \nhigher than 1.0. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \n\n3. \n\nAffordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n\n \nDue to the economic difficulties in the project area, only partial recovery of O&M cost will \n92. \nbe  achieved  in  the  early  years  after  completion  of  the  project  facilities  (para.  77).  Full  cost \nrecovery of O&M cost is targeted within 10 years after completion of the project facilities. User \ncharges  will  need  to  be  increased  to  ensure  sustainability  of  project  facilities  and  operation  of \nthe  utility  agencies.  However,  the  charges  need  to  be  increased  in  stages  taking  into \nconsideration  affordability  for  the  beneficiaries;  in  particular  the  poor  must  be  protected  from \ncharge  increases.  The  current  tariff  is  based  on  a  flat  per  capita  charge  irrespective  of  the \nvolume  of  water  consumed.  A  stepped  tariff  structure  is  proposed.  A  lifeline  tariff  for  low \nconsumption  at  a  rate  affordable  to  the  lowest  income  users  will  be  applied.  Consumption  in \nexcess of the lifeline block of 10 m3 per person per month will be charged at a higher rate. The \nproposed  tariff  structure  assumes  an  estimated  average  household  of  5.6  members  and \nconsumption  of  about  75  lcd  for  average  income  households  with  connections  and  60  lcd,  or \nabout  10m3  per  month  consumption,  for  low  income  households.  An  affordability  analysis  was \nundertaken to assess whether the proposed tariff is affordable to residential consumers, based \non estimated tariffs and household income data from the social survey.  \n \nThe  household  charges  were  compared  with  willingness  to  pay.  Results  from  the \n93. \nsocioeconomic survey showed that households were willing to pay an average of SUM300 per \nmonth  for  water.  Proposed  charges  for  average  water  consumption  ranging  from  SUM260  to \nSUM310  per  household  are  in  line  with  the  average  willingness  to  pay.  Proposed  average \nhousehold charges were also compared with average household income. Water charges of less \nthan 5 percent of income are considered to be affordable, in line with ADB affordability criteria. \nProposed charges are about 3 to 5 percent of average household income. For very low-income \nresidents,  proposed  charges  for  60  lcd  were  compared  with  the  income  of  the  poorest  10 \npercent of households. Proposed charges are lower than 5 percent of household income in the \nsample subproject districts. The detailed affordability analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nB. \n \n94. \nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  components  will  have  no  adverse  impact  on  the  environment. \nMost of the physical work, including rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and new construction \nsuch as WDCs and additions to the distribution networks, will be on land already designated for \npublic  services.  These  works  will  not  encroach  on  sensitive  ecological,  cultural,  or  historical \nsites.  Replaced  pipes  will  be  disposed  of  through  metal  recycling,  and  other  wastes  from \nexcavations and from demolition work will be disposed of in designated municipal landfills. The \nProject is expected to have a positive impact on the environment by improving the quantity and \nquality  of  delivered  water  to  rural  communities  and  providing  simple  sanitation  facilities  to \nschools and clinics. The abstraction and production of water will more closely match consumer \ndemand  by  reducing  inefficiencies  and  losses.  The  use  of  metering  and  consumption-based \n\nEnvironment \n\n\f \n\n \n29\n\n \n\nbilling  will  encourage  conservation  by  users.  Continuous  environmental  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken as part of the project performance monitoring system to ensure construction quality \nand environmental management meets national standards. \n \nC. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Health Impact \n\n \nSupported  by  the  public  health  awareness  component,  the  supply  of  potable  water  will \n95. \nhave a marked positive impact on the health of the population. Water consumers will achieve a \nsignificant  reduction  in  their  medical  expenses  thereby  freeing  up  income  for  the  purchase  of \nmore food. An indirect positive impact will be the improvement in nutrition and reduction of the \nincidence  of  anemia.  Adults  will  become  more  productive  and  able  to  participate  in \nincome-generating  activities.  School  absenteeism  will  decrease  as  children  will  become \nhealthier  and  will  not  be  required  to  spend  time  collecting  water.  The  extension  of  rural \nassemblies  to  local  water  management  will  provide  the  basis  for  involving  future  development \nprojects.  The  Project  will  also  help  to  decrease  the  out-migration  of  population  from \nKarakalpakstan and thereby assist in preserving local culture and customs. \n \n96.  Waterborne infectious diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid, and hepatitis A are common \nin  the  project  area.  Project  beneficiaries  will  experience  a  rapid  reduction  in  these  infections \nwhen  their  household  sanitation  practices  are  improved,  together  with  those  at  schools  and \nhospitals. The provision of water will reduce exposure of the community to high levels of toxic \nsalts,  which  exist  in  groundwater  that  they  currently  drink.  In  the  medium  to  longer  term,  the \nincidence  of  chronic  diseases  of  the  liver  (hepatitis),  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  kidneys,  and \nsome  cancers,  which  are  associated  with  decreased  immunity  linked  to  toxic  salt  levels,  are \nexpected  to  decrease.  The  public  health  awareness  program  and  improvement  in  sanitation \nfacilities at schools and hospitals will have a positive impact on rates of waterborne infections. \nThe provision of potable water in clinics will substantially improve their ability to wash patients \nand equipment with clean water. This benefit will be most felt by clinics that have no gas supply \nto boil water. \n \n\n2. \n\nGender and Development \n\n \n97.  Women are target beneficiaries of this Project since they are traditionally responsible for \ncollecting and managing drinking water, and health and hygiene in the home. Many of them are \nin poor health due to anemia and water-related diseases.34 The Project will relieve women of the \nburden of walking long distances and queuing for water collection, and thus free their time for \nrest  and  other  activities.  The  women  will  benefit  from  education  provided  by  the  Project, \nenabling  them  to  realize  their  desire  to  improve  the  protection  of  their  children  from  disease. \nWomen  will  also  be  involved  in  various  aspects  of  project  implementation,  i.e.,  water \nconservation,  and  public  health  awareness.  This  experience  will  strengthen  their  capacity  to \ntake up future self-help projects as and when opportunities arise. \n \nD. \n \n98. \nBased on the socioeconomic survey and using the minimum wage criteria (para. 19 and \nfootnote 11), over 60 percent of the beneficiaries in the two districts are poor. The proportion of \npoor  households  is  80  percent  in  the  sample  district  of  Bozatau  (Karakalpakstan)  and  55 \n                                                 \n34 Official data show that 98 percent of women of reproductive age in Khorezm and 81.2 percent in Karakalpakstan \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\nare anemic. \n\n\f \n\n \n30\n\n \n\npercent in Koshkupir (Khorezm). Water-related morbidity rates are high, and people often have \nto  spend  a  large  portion  of  their  income  or  sell  their  assets  to  pay  for  medical  treatment.  The \nProject will improve water supply service to these poor rural communities. Increased access to \nwater  services  will  result  in  improved  living  conditions  and  hygiene  practices  among  the  rural \npoor, thereby reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases and related medical expenses. In \nmost cases, significant cost savings from the use of alternative and distant water sources can \nbe used for income-generating activities. \n \nThe Project will benefit poor households by introducing a tariff structure that charges by \n99. \nvolume  of  water  used  and  a  lifeline  tariff  for  low  consumption  households.  This  will  guarantee \naccess to water services that are affordable to the rural poor. Beyond the lifeline consumption of \n10  m3  per  month,  a  higher  tariff  will  be  charged  to  ensure  water  demand  management  and \nconservation by higher income users. \n \n100.  The Project will improve the quality of life of the beneficiaries through (i) access to safe \ndrinking water and better sanitation facilities; (ii) access to washing facilities; (iii) lower morbidity \nlevel  from  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases;  and  (iv)  less  time  spent  on  water  collection,  i.e., \nloss  of  productive  time.  Since  lower  income  households  are  more  vulnerable  to  service \ndeficiencies as coping mechanisms are unaffordable, they are more vulnerable to sickness. This \ncan lead to comparatively low school attendance and decreased ability to learn or to be involved \nin  productive  work.  The  Project  will  also  create  construction-related  job  opportunities  for  the \nunemployed skilled and unskilled laborers during the implementation stage. About 600 person-\nmonths of skilled employment and about 1,000 person-months of unskilled employment will be \ncreated by the Project. The results of the poverty impact assessment are in Appendix 15. \n \nE. \n \n101.  Six  possible  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  control  of  the  flow  in  Amudarya  River  by \nriparian  countries  upstream  of  Uzbekistan;  (ii)  failure  of  raw  water  pumping  and  transmission \nsystems  to  deliver  the  necessary  water  to  the  distribution  centers;  (iii)  lack  of  institutional \ncapacity, particularly at the local level, and experience in subproject selection and appraisal; (iv) \nlack of experience by the operating agencies, principally the agrovodokanals, to collect payment \nfrom  individual  consumers  and  by  the  individuals  to  recognize  the  need  for  and  manage  such \npayments; (v) lower than expected realization of subsidy or cost recovery jeopardizing service \nsustainability; and (vi) delay in project implementation due to unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. \nThe Government recognizes that agricultural projects in other regions must be sustainable and \nis  developing  facilities  to  support  this  policy.35  The  Government  is  also  working  closely  with \nneighboring  countries  to  develop  a  coherent  policy  on  water  resource  management  that  is \nendorsed by the subregional governments. International development agencies are supporting \nthis  initiative.  A  subproject  component  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  delivery  facilities  to  the \nTuyamuyon-Nukus system thus significantly improving the security of raw water supply. The risk \nof  pump  failure  will  be  minimized  by  establishing  good  maintenance  procedures  and  ensuring \npower  supply  from  alternative  sources.  The  issue  of  institutional  capability  in  subproject \nselection  and  appraisal  has  been  dealt  with  by  including  the  capacity  building  program,  which \nincludes  project  management  support  to  assist  in  project  implementation.  Through  O&M \ntraining, \nin  project \nimplementation  and  O&M.  The  Government  is  committed  under  its  current  policy  to  subsidize \nthe  agrovodokanals,  in  particular  those  in  the  project  area,  to  ensure  sustainable  service \ndelivery  to  the  rural  population.  The  capacity  building  component  will  comprise  training  in  (i) \n                                                 \n35 The Karshi Cascade Project in Kashkadarya province funded by the World Bank is an example. ADB will also be \n\nthe  agrovodokanals  will  be \n\ntheir  effectiveness \n\nto  ensure \n\ntrained \n\nRisks \n\nproviding assistance to the agriculture sector (footnote 18). \n\n\f \n\n \n31\n\n \n\ntariff  setting;  (ii)  tariff  reviews;  (iii)  customer  service  training;  and  (iv)  regular  monitoring  of \ncustomer  satisfaction  to  improve  service  delivery,  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay,  and  tariff \ncollection.  Measures  to  reduce  possible  delays  have  been  discussed  with  the  Government. \nAgency  responsibilities  and  appropriate  mechanisms  for  coordination  have  been  identified  to \navoid the risk of delay in implementation. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n102. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nCounterpart  funding.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  during  each  year  of \nproject  implementation  adequate  funding,  including  budgetary  allocations,  of \ncounterpart funds will be made, and such funds will be released by the relevant \nauthorities  on  a  timely  and  regular  basis  to  facilitate  project  implementation  by \npreparing and adopting, by 30 September of each year, an operation plan for the \nnext year. \n\nPMU  and  PIU  staff.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  PMU  and  PIUs  are \nalways  adequately  staffed  with  competent  technical,  accounting,  and  support \nstaff. \n\nSubproject  selection  and  review.  The  Government  will  follow  the  selection \ncriteria for subproject selection, and will seek ADB\u2019s approval for each of the first \ntwo subprojects from Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, all subprojects that cost over \n$200,000, and those having social and environmental issues prior to any contract \naward for that subproject. The Government will submit completion reports for the \nfirst  10  subprojects  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  comments.  Selection  of  subprojects \ninvolving the Kaparas Reservoir facilities in Tuyamuyun complex requires a letter \nof  no-objection  from  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Turkmenistan  and \napproval from ADB. \n\nSanitary  facilities  and  health  awareness.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nwherever  a  piped  water  supply  is  provided  under  the  Project,  improvements  to \nsanitation  facilities  and  provision  of  hand-washing  facilities  at  all  kindergartens, \nschools and clinics, as well as health awareness programs will also be provided. \n\nMaintenance  of  project  facilities.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  project \nlocal  governments, \nfacilities  are  properly  managed  by \nagrovodokanals, and rural assemblies through the collection of user charges and \nother local taxes; and provide subsidies when required.  \n\nthe  concerned \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nCost recovery. The Government will ensure that (a) revenues from water tariffs \ncover O&M project cost as a first priority; and (b) full cost recovery of O&M and \npartial  recovery  of  capital  cost  is  achieved  in  a  staged  manner  within  a  10-year \nperiod after completion of the project facilities.  \n\n \n(vii)  Nonrevenue  water.  The  Government  will  establish  appropriate  monitoring \nsystems  for  nonrevenue  water  by  2003  to  ensure  the  reduction  of  nonrevenue \n\n\f \n32\n\n \n\nwater in the subproject districts so that by 2005 nonrevenue water will not exceed \n30 percent of the total water generated by each agrovodokanal in the subproject \ndistricts.  \n\n \n(viii)  Environment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  project  implementation  is \ncarried  out \nlaws,  regulations, \nin  accordance  with  existing  environmental \nstandards,  and  international  agreements  signed  by  Uzbekistan,  and  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines, \nin  particular,  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and \nProcedures  of  ADB;  (b)  all  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures  indicated  in  the \ninitial  environmental  examination  are  undertaken  for  the  Project;  (c)  project \nimplementation will include consultation with local communities on environmental \nissues, and the public will have access to environmental information pertaining to \nthe Project; (d) the existing capacity for carrying out monitoring of water and air \nemission  will  be  maintained  during  the  Project\u2019s  life;  (e)  initial  environmental \nexaminations  and  environmental  impact  assessments,  where  applicable,  will  be \ncarried  out  for  the  subprojects  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review;  and  (f)  any \nnegative environmental impact that may occur as a result of the implementation \nof any subproject will be mitigated.  \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nCBOs  and  NGOs.  The  Government  will  (a)  facilitate  involvement  of  CBOs  and \nNGOs  concerned  in  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  O&M  of  the \nsubprojects;  (b)  actively  assist  with  capacity  building,  such  as  in  the  health  and \nhygiene  components  of  the  Project;  and  (c)  ensure  participation  of  women  in \ncommunity  groups \nimplementation,  availability  of  adequate \nemployment opportunities for women by agrovodokanals in project activities, and \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  Development  during  project \nimplementation.  \n\nin  project \n\nAccounting  standards.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary \nmeasures  are  taken  within  one  year  from  project  commencement  to  allow  the \nPMU  and  PIUs  to  apply  international  accounting  standards  (of  the  International \nAccounting Standards Committee or other internationally accepted standards) for \nthe purpose of this Project. \n\nAudit.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  account  and  financial \nstatements  are  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  in  accordance  with  sound \naudit standards acceptable to ADB, and ensure that the auditor will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to \nADB. Loan funds may be used to finance expenditure for private sector auditors \nand translation of auditor\u2019s reports into English. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System. The PMU and the two PIUs will put \nin  place  project  performance  and  management  monitoring  and  evaluation \nindicators,  including  baseline  data  and  indicators  of  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental impacts of the Project upon the beneficiaries, within three months \nof  loan  effectiveness,  and  will  submit  project  performance  monitoring  system \nreports  to  be  incorporated  in  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  project \ncompletion report to ADB. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n33\n\n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n103.  Prior to loan effectiveness:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe Government will have issued a decree specifying the project implementation \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  namely  (a)  the  respective  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of \nthe  governments  of \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  and  other  relevant  agencies  in  implementing  the \nProject; and (b) flow of funds between such parties; and   \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  MMS, \n\nthe PMU and PIUs will be established. \n\n \n(ii) \n \nCondition for Disbursement \n\nC. \n \n104.  Except for mobilization payments for project consultants, loan disbursement will not take \nplace until the Government has fielded the project management consultants provided under the \nProject. \n

The  checklist  of  water  project \nactions known to affect environmental resources and values was applied.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be  set  up  under  the  Project  and  the  utility \nagencies  concerned  will  also  conduct  environmental  screening  during  appraisal  of  the  water \nsupply subprojects according to the laws of Uzbekistan. The law requires that an environmental \nimpact  statement  will  be  prepared  starting  at  the  time  of  the  selection  of  the  construction  site, \nand  with  tasks  continuing  through  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies,  implementation,  and \nconstruction.  Where  appropriate,  an  initial  environmental  examination  and,  if  required,  an \nenvironmental impact assessment, will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Requirement and relevant local laws and procedures. \n \nB. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe project physical components comprise works as identified generally in Table A10.  \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nTable A10: Physical Components \n \n\nWater Supply Component \nBulk water pumping station \nTransmission mains \nTrunk main \u2013 rehabilitation and new \nNew borehole \nStorage reservoir \nChlorine dosing facility \nDesalination units \nLocal booster pumping (stations) \nReplace fragile/defective mains \nConstruction of new distribution mains \nSupply, district, consumer metering \nOperational plant and equipment \nAsset management facilities \nLaboratory testing \n \n\nKarakalpakstan \n1 \n56 km \n34 km \n8 \n24 \n24 \n8 \n24 \n100 km \n160 km \nTBA \n1 \n2 \n1 \n \n\nKhorezm \n1 \n16 km \n50 km \n0 \n20 \n20 \n0 \n20 \n140 km \n100 km \nTBA \n1 \n2 \n1 \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \nC. \n \n4. \nPhysical.  Most  of  the  project  works  will  occur  within  the  rural  environment  where  low \ndensities  of  population  and  lack  of  formal  infrastructure  applies.  The  terrain  is  flat  and, \nparticularly  in  Karakalpakstan,  is  predominantly  desert.  Agriculture  is  wholly  dependent  on \nirrigation. The climate is hot and dry in summer, causing a significant increase in water use.  \n \n5. \nThe quality of abstracted raw water varies considerably according to the source and is \ntreated accordingly. Treated water is transmitted in buried pipelines, stored in closed reservoirs, \nthen  further  chlorinated  and  either  pumped  into  the  below-ground  distribution  network  or \ntransported by road tanker to delivery points.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n56\n\nAppendix 10, page 2                          \n\n \n\n \n\nEcological.  Years  of  intensive  agricultural  production,  primarily  cotton  growing,  has \n6. \ncaused serious, long-term ecological problems in Uzbekistan. Rivers are badly polluted by cattle \nbreeding,  industrial  effluent,  and  sewage,  in  addition  to  receiving  surface  runoff  and  leachate \nloaded with agrochemicals. These river waters require treatment prior to use for potable supply. \nShallow groundwater sources are also liable to contamination from surface activities and are not \nfavored  as  a  potential  source  of  water.  Deep  ground  waters  are  generally  free  from  pollution \nalthough heavily laden with mineral salts.  \n \nSocioeconomic.  The  poor  level  of  water  availability  and  quality  in  the  rural  regions  of \n7. \nthe  Aral  Sea  area  have  social  and  health  impacts.  Water-borne  diseases  are  prevalent \nthroughout  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  and  unemployment  exceeds  50  percent  of  the \nqualifying  population.  As  a  result,  a  large  majority  of  the  population  are  poor  and  unable  to \nafford medical treatment or, in many cases, nutritious foods. \n \nD. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nProject Location \n\n \n8. \nThe  proposed  work  is  in  low-density  rural  areas  without  well-developed  formal \ninfrastructure.  The  work  comprises  rehabilitation  of  existing  and  introduction  of  new  water \nsupply  and  distribution  facilities.  None  of  the  water  supply  components  will  adversely  affect \nnatural or cultural resources nor sensitive ecological zones, and no resettlement of residents is \nrequired by any of the activities.  \n\n \n2. \n\nDesign Aspects \n\n \n9. \nThe overall effect of the proposed works will be to improve the availability, quality, and \nefficiency  of  water  service.  Water  resource  options  will  include  the  review  of  available  and \nsustainable  sources.    Where  applicable,  boreholes  will  be  drilled  to  deep  aquifers  that  are \nproven  to  provide  sufficient  yield  and  of  a  quality  that  can  be  readily  desalinated.  The  use  of \nmetering and consumption-based billing will encourage conservation by users. Water quality will \nimprove  as  a  result  of  improved  filtering  and  chlorination,  and  by  replacing  leaky  distribution \nnetworks  to  reduce  infiltration  by  groundwater.  Improvement  of  testing  laboratories  in  the \nagrovodokanals (rural water supply agencies) will improve their capacity to monitor the quality of \nraw water and water supplied to the distribution network.  \n \n10. \nand construction standards.   \n\nChlorine-dosing facilities will be designed and constructed to comply with state planning \n\nConstruction \n\n \n11. \nThe  construction  of  pipe  networks  is  likely  to  cause  minor,  temporary  impacts  such  as \ntraffic  disruption,  and  potential  for  erosion  (silt  runoff)  at  excavation  and  trenching  sites. \nHowever these are routine problems that can be mitigated by construction management.   \n\nOperations Stage \n\n \n12. \nImproved efficiencies in all phases of service provision, combined with tariff reforms, will \nimprove  the  willingness  to  pay  and,  in  the  longer  term,  enable  the  generation  of  revenues  to \nsustain  the  service  at  the  improved  levels.  Where  new  equipment  is  installed,  training  on \noperation and maintenance will be provided. \n\n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n57\n\nAppendix 10, page 3                          \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirements \n\n \n13. \nEach of the utility agencies concerned will be required to assess environmental impacts \nof  the  project  physical  work,  and  to  prepare  the  statements  of  environmental  impacts  and \nconsequences  required  by  law  in  Uzbekistan.  The  works  proposed  are  similar  to  other  works \nconducted  by  the  respective  utility  agencies  although  training  will  be  needed  (and  will  be \nprovided  under  the  Project),  for  them  to  prepare  the  required  environmental  impact \nassessments.  \n \n14. \nOnce  the  components  are  operational,  the  utility  agencies  will  need  to  monitor  water \nquality  according  to  existing  laws  and  regulations.  A  monitoring  plan  will  be  set  up  at  the \ncommencement of the Project and will specify the frequency, methods, quality standards, and \nprocedures and actions to be followed as a result of noncompliance. This monitoring is currently \nundertaken  by  the  Sanitary  Epidemeological  Survey,  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  on  their \nbehalf,  but  this  arrangement  should  prove  unnecessary  after  completion  of  the  Project. \nOperational  safety  will  be  improved  under  the  Project  and  a  designated  safety  officer  will  be \nincluded in training provided to operators of equipment under the Project. The safety officer will \nmonitor and arrange the necessary mitigation of hazardous working conditions. \n\n \n6. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nthe \n\nImprovements \n\nto  sanitation  and  hygiene  will  reduce \n\n \n15. \nNone of the Project\u2019s physical components will cause significant environmental impacts \nbased  on  the  screening  of  possible  environmental  consequences  using  ADB  checklists.  The \nwater supply project components will improve the access to safe water, but will not cause any \nsignificant  depletion  of  resource  in  the  process.  Improved  supply  networks  will  reduce  losses \nand  waste. \nincidence  and \nsocioeconomic costs of illness.  \n \nThe  PIUs  should  each  designate  one  staff  member  as  responsible  for  (i)  assuring  that \n16. \ntender  and  contract  documents  contain  binding  provisions  to  prevent  and  mitigate  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts;  (ii)  assuring  that  the  implementing  utility  agencies  comply  with \nGovernment environmental impact regulations and standards; and (iii) monitoring and reporting \non impacts and compliance with the adopted environmental protection measures.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  but  will  result  in \n17. \nnumerous  environmental  improvements.  A  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not \nconsidered necessary. \n \n \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n58 \n\n         Appendix 11, page1   \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nBackground \n\nReport Outline \n\n \nA. \n \nThis  report  provides  a  profile  of  the  key  characteristics  of  residents  in  the  sample \n1. \nsubproject  districts,  including  their  perceived  needs,  and  evaluates  the  likely  impact  of  the \nProject  on  them  including  their  ability  to  access  project  benefits.  The  report  is  based  on \nresearch consisting of a random statistical survey of 200 households in each of two subproject \ndistricts  (Bozatau  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Koshkupir  in  Khorezm)  and  focus  groups,  separately \nfor  women  and  men,  convened  in  each  district.1  The  participants  represented  low-income \npeople  living  in  rural  settlements  within  these  districts.  Meetings  were  also  held  with  local \ngovernment officials and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) active within the districts \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe project districts are located within Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, which have been \nfacing  water  shortage  problems  further  intensified  by  the  ongoing  drought.  The  traditional \nsources  of  income  from  agriculture  and  fishing  have  all  but  ceased,  and  the  majority  of \nhouseholds rely on social assistance. The basic human need for safe drinking water is not being \nmet. Water availability from wells is inadequate and of poor quality, polluted with fecal bacteria \nand  high  salt  levels.  Consequently  the  level  of  morbidity  is  high,  and  women  and  children  are \nforced to travel long distances to fetch water. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  household  monthly  income  in  Bozatau  ranges  from  SUM6,900  to  SUM15,900. \nCorresponding  figures  for  Koshkupir  are  SUM7,600  and  SUM18,900.  The  majority  of \nhouseholds  have  between  3  and  8  members.  Monthly  per  capita  income  was  lowest  in \nhouseholds above 9 members (e.g., less than SUM2,000 in Bozatau for households with 9\u201312 \npersons).  Large  households  of  12  persons  or  more  comprise  10  percent  of  the  total.  Mean \nmonthly household expenditure on health is a major expense and comprises about SUM6,000 \nin Bozatau and SUM9,000 in Koshkupir. Per capita daily food consumption is extremely low: in \nBozatau the mean calorie intake is 1,996 and 2,335 in Koshkupir. \n \nD. \n \nWomen  in  the  project  area  are  traditionally  responsible  for  collecting  water  used  for \n4. \ndrinking,  cooking,  childcare,  and  cleaning.  The  traditional  male  occupations  of  crop  cultivation \nand  livestock  rearing  have  significantly  declined  due  to  the  prevailing  ecological  conditions.  In \nmany  households  women  are  now  the  main  wage  earners,  working  in  low  paid  service  jobs \nsuch as cleaning.  \n \nE. \n \nIn some rural areas (27 percent in Koshkupir and 54 percent of Bozatau) households are \n5. \nsupplied  by  the  agrovodokanals  (rural  water  supply  agencies);  while  the  service  is  very  often \n\nWater Sources and Availability \n\nProfile of Project Beneficiaries \n\nRole of Women \n\n                                                 \n1  The  socioeconomic  survey  and  focus  group  discussions  were  carried  out  during  February  2002  under  TA  3828-\nUZB: Aral Sea Area Drought Relief Project, for $150,000, approved on 3 January 2002. The two districts are typical \nfor rural Karakalpakstan and Khorezm. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n59 \n\n         Appendix 11, page2   \n\nSanitation and Health \n\nscheduled,2  in  some  cases  the  connection  has  completely  failed.  The  majority  of  the  rural \npopulation  rely  on  water  from  shallow  wells  (70  percent  of  Bozatau  and  92  percent  of \nKoshkupir), which is limited, seasonally irregular, and of extreme poor quality. \n \nIn Koshkupir, people with water pipes and intermittent supplies are able to grow fruit and \n6. \nvegetables in their garden plots. However poor water quality affects production. When water is \nnot available nearby, or when the quality is very poor, people travel longer distances, often more \nthan  2  kilometers  to  find  water.  A  few  households  have  paid  for  private  boreholes  and  supply \nwater  to  neighbors.  People  in  Koshkupir  are  sometimes  able  to  obtain  water  from  irrigation \nchannels and cooling water from the electricity plant. Like well water, the irrigation water needs \nto be boiled and the industrial water contains toxic chemicals. Sometimes households have no \nwater for days. Coping mechanisms include borrowing water from neighbors. Since the onset of \nthe  drought,  people  have  to  pay  for  such  water.  In  some  cases,  people  have  to  sell  milk \n(normally for personal consumption) from the cow to buy water. In Bozatau, since they have no \ncash, they borrow and repay neighbors in water. \n \nF. \n \n7. \nCommunity awareness, motivation, and standards on sanitary practices are very low and \nmodes  of  transmission  of  waterborne  diseases  are  little  known.  Latrines,  where  available,  are \ninadequately constructed. Many schools, especially in Bozatau, are without water pipes or wells, \nand  are  unable  to  provide  hand-washing  facilities  for  pupils.  In  Bozatau,  people  have  little \nsurplus  water  left  for  cleaning.  Expenditure  on  sanitation  takes  low  priority.  The  exception  is \namong  women  in  Koshkupir  who  want  to  improve  their  latrines.  Teachers  interviewed  in  the \nsubproject districts are aware of the health risks but have no budget to improve facilities. Some \nprovide their own labor to dig new school latrines. Drinking water is boiled in the schools but it is \nsalty and the availability is often inadequate. \n \nPeople  associate  the  high  salt  levels  in  their  water  with  kidney  disease  but  do  not \n8. \nassociate  infectious  diseases  with  unboiled  water.  Expenditure  on  medical  treatment  is \nextremely  high  and  is  the  predominant  reason  for  having  to  relinquish  assets.  When  people \nhave no money to pay for treatment they attempt to borrow from family or from neighbors. When \nthis is not possible they sell their assets such as the cow. The household cow is often the main \nasset  and  cow  milk  is  a  more  important  income  source  than  crops.  Watering  the  cow  takes \npriority over washing.  People become extremely vulnerable if they have no cow and are then \nunable to obtain medical treatment. This may partly explain the low levels of disease recorded in \nofficial statistics. \n \nG. \n  \nThe  research  reveals  differing  socioeconomic  conditions  across  the  study  areas.  In \n9. \nKoshkupir,  salty  water  is  usually  available  from  the  wells  and  hand  pumps.  Men\u2019s  concern  is \ntherefore  to  maintain  their  ability  to  irrigate  and  to  desalinate  the  water  to  increase  crop  yield. \nThe women are mainly concerned about water quality. At the other extreme, in Bozatau, water \nof any quality is very scarce so people are concerned about supply as well as quality. Feeding \nthe cow takes equal priority since it provides income to buy food.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   Scheduled supplies are often restricted to one hour in morning and one hour in afternoon. \n\nPerceived Needs and Demands \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n60 \n\n         Appendix 11, page3   \n\nAffordability \n\nWillingness to Pay \n\nH. \n \n10.  Willingness to pay for drinking water in the sample districts is linked to perceptions about \nthe  future  viability  of  crop  production  and  whether  water  supply  is  available  through  pipes \nnearby. Men\u2019s willingness to pay is particularly sensitive to these conditions since in Koshkupir \nthey  are  responsible  for  crop  production  to  generate  income,  as  well  as  for  household \nconsumption.  Shallow  wells  in  Koshkupir  still  have  adequate  water  although  its  quality  is  very \npoor.  Households  with  pipes  do  not  support  metering  since  they  are  concerned  that  water  for \nirrigation will also be charged. However other households support metering. All the focus groups \nare  against  shared  metering  because  they  feel  that  there  will  be  an  abuse  of  water  use. \nRespondents  are  initially  skeptical  about  paying  for  water  because  they  are  concerned  about \naffordability. However, when savings on health care and project financing are explained, most \nagree that they should pay a token amount related to consumption level. \n \nI. \n \nAffordability  is  relatively  low  and  the  conventional  measure  of  5  percent  of  household \n11. \nincome is too high since other basic human needs are not currently being met. People subsist \non milky tea, bread, and pasta. Many cannot afford medical treatment and often cannot afford \nsoap.  Focus  groups  report  children  missing  school  due  to  inadequate  winter  clothing.  Cash \nincome is low since utility bills are being deducted at source from allowances and pensions. The \nproposed tariff takes this into consideration to establish charges based on level of consumption, \nincluding  a  lifeline  tariff  for  the  lowest  income  group.  Overall  people  will  be  charged  about  3 \npercent of household income. It is also proposed that community based organizations (CBOs) \nallocate water credits and coupons to subsidize poor consumers. \n \nJ. \n \nRural communities in the sample subproject districts have well-organized CBOs. These \n12. \ntake the form of formal rural assemblies and their constituent neighborhood organizations. The \ndistrict  governments  maintain  good  contact  with  them  and  also  retain  women\u2019s  committees. \nNGOs  are  active  in  Karakalpakstan  with  over  160  NGOs  of  which  at  least  70  are  active.  In \nKhorezm, 43 are registered. The strong social support structure in rural areas is likely to ensure \nthat  all  households  will  receive  equitable  amounts  of  drinking  water  provided  sufficient \ninfrastructure is available for water delivery within reasonable distances. Settlement patterns are \nscattered and a piped supply will not always be cost effective. CBOs will be consulted on water \ndelivery to areas that may not have pipes. Consumers are prepared to assist in laying pipe and \nin transporting water to distribution points.  \n \nK. \n \n13. \nThe mitigation of the Aral Sea environmental problems will not be achieved quickly, and \nthe  rapidly  deteriorating  socioeconomic  and  health  situation  requires  emergency  aid.  The \ndrinking water project and associated health awareness component will partially reduce poverty \nin that people will have reduced exposure to disease and will therefore spend less on medical \ntreatment.  This  will  release  their  meager  resources  to  buy  more  nutritious  food  and  help  to \nreduce the very high levels of anemia among women in reproductive age groups and improve \nperinatal  health.  School-age  children  will  become  healthier  and  have  increased  learning \ncapacity.    The  proposed  Project  will  bring  significant  positive  social  impact  to  the  target \nbeneficiaries. \n \n\nCommunity Structure and Absorptive Capacity \n\nSocial Impact of the Project \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  \n \n\n61\n\n            Appendix 12, page 1  \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nMethodology and Approach \n\nEconomic Rationale and Without-Project Situation \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  economic  analysis  is  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) guidelines, including Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, and Handbook for \nthe Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The analysis describes the economic rationale \nand  target  beneficiaries,  sets  out  the  without-project  situation,  and  undertakes  an  analysis  of \nalternatives.  The  analysis  compares  the  calculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for \nthe  sample  subprojects1  with  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  which  is \nassumed  to  be  12  percent.2    Standard  and  project-specific  sensitivity  tests  are  undertaken  to \nassess the robustness of the EIRR calculation. The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, \nas benefits are nontradable in nature. The analysis is undertaken in constant 2002 prices. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe water supply components will (i) generate major efficiency gains, reducing network \nleakage and pumping energy costs by over 20 percent; (ii) improve cost recovery through better \nuser satisfaction with service delivery; (iii) improve access to safe water for the nonconnected \nhouseholds;  (iv)  reduce  natural  resource  depletion;  (iv)  improve  public  health  by  reducing  the \nincidence  of  waterborne  disease;  and  (v)  support  economic  recovery.  Unaccounted  for  water \nwill be reduced from in excess of 50 percent, to a target of 30 percent over the Project\u2019s life.  \n \nRural  water  supply  services  in  the  project  districts  are  inadequate.3  Assets  have \n3. \ndeteriorated  and  lack  of  proper  maintenance  is  such  that  water  supply  in  the  two  subproject \ndistricts  is  severely  compromised.  Without  urgent  major  investment  in  production  and  the \ndistribution network, the agrovodokanals\u2019 (rural water supply agency) water supply systems will \ncontinue to deteriorate rapidly, with serious economic and environmental consequences. Water \nshortages and pressure problems limit the actual supply to between 30 and 60 percent of those \nconnected  in  Bozatau  and  Koshkupir  respectively,  and  without  urgent  investment  the  systems \nare  expected  to  fail  completely  within  10  years.  The  Project  is  considered  high  priority  by  the \nGovernment,  is  timely,  and  is  well  integrated  with  other  investment  activities  in  these  two \nregions to pursue the long-term objective of providing sufficient and secure water supply to the \nrural population. Improved efforts on cost recovery and operation and maintenance (O&M) will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  willingness-to-pay,  sustainability  of  services,  and  potable  water \nresource management. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe Project focuses on the secure and sustainable supply of good quality potable water \nto rural communities within the districts of the two provinces.  The physical works will generally \ncomprise  trunk  mains,  pumping  stations,  boreholes  and  desalination  plants,  reservoirs  with \nchlorination  equipment,  and  local  distribution  networks  that  will  include  metering.  The  Project \nwill  also  provide  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  to  agrovodokanals,4  health \nawareness education to the population, and improvements to sanitation at schools and clinics. \nThe Project will benefit about 700,000 customers, as well as small businesses, and educational \n                                                 \n1  The sample subproject districts are Bozatau in Karakalpakstan and Koshkupir in Khorezm.  \n2   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n3  Service  coverage  levels  are  low,  27  percent  and  54  percent  of  rural  population  in  Koshkupir  and  Bozatau, \nrespectively, and service levels are low with two to four hours intermittent supply. The rest of the population obtain \nwater from hand pumps, boreholes, and canals, which are distant, saline, and contaminated in most cases. \n\nProject Description and Beneficiaries \n\n4  The World Bank-funded Water Supply and Sanitation Project has initiated institutional reforms among vodokanals \n(urban water supply agencies). These include tariff restructuring measures in pilot districts where water metering \nhas been installed. \n\n\f62\n\nEconomic Costs \n\nAnalysis of Alternatives   \n\n            Appendix 12, page 2  \n\n  \n \nand  medical  institutions.    Access  to  a  clean,  safe,  and  reliable  water  supply  system  will  be  of \nparticular benefit to the rural poor.  Community-based consumer committees will also be set up \nin  each  district  to  help  the  agrovodokanal  develop  a  more  customer-oriented  service  and \nimprove  customer  satisfaction.  Specific  service  delivery  targets  for  water  supply  and  water \nquality have been agreed with the Government. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nAn  analysis  of  technical  alternatives  was  undertaken  based  on  items  that  were \nconsidered  essential  for  establishing  a  sustainable  water  supply  system.  In  Koshkupir,  no \ngroundwater  sources  are  suitable,  and  hence  potable  water  should  be  from  the  Tuyamuyun \ntrunk  main  system  only.  In  Bozatau,  a  number  of  potential  options  are  available,  including \nshallow groundwater lenses, deep aquifers, and where practical, connection to the Tuyamuyun \nsupply.  However,  shallow  lenses  are  not  necessarily  reliable  and  deep  aquifer  resources \ndepend upon desalination before the water is of a potable standard. The choice of single option \nor a combination of options will therefore depend on (i) physical feasibility, (ii) unit cost of supply \nbased  on  incremental  investment  and  O&M  costs,  and  (iii)  sustainability  of  resource.    The \nconsideration of alternative sources was strengthened by the choice of the most cost-effective \nrehabilitation of the distribution system and construction of new water distribution centers.  \n \nE. \n \n6. \nEconomic  costs  exclude  taxes,  and  financial  prices  are  converted  to  economic  prices \nusing  conversion  factors.  The  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  was  assumed  to  be  1.4 \nbased on the existing relationship between the commercial rate and the official rate.5 Since the \nSERF  is  a  key  input  into  the  analysis,  tests  were  undertaken  to  assess  the  sensitivity  of  the \nProject to changes in the SERF. The conversion factor for labor was assumed to be 0.8, since \nthere  is  excess  employment  in  communal  services  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  staff. \nConsiderable savings are made in operational costs under the Project, due to efficiency gains, \nbut these savings are reduced due to projected increases in O&M expenditure due to increased \nproduction  and  distribution  capacity.  The  incremental  economic  costs  are  phased  over  the \nProject\u2019s planning period, assumed to be 20 years, after completion.  \n \nF. \n \n7. \nFor water supply components, the major economic benefits comprise (i) cost savings on \nthe nonincremental supply to connected and nonconnected households; and (ii) willingness-to-\npay  based  on  average  demand  price  for  incremental  water  supplies.  For  connected  and \nnonconnected  households,  the  nonincremental  benefits  are  quantified  using  the  resource  cost \nsavings approach for (i) use of alternative water sources; (ii) time savings for water collection; \n(iii)  nontechnical  losses;6  and  (iv)  savings  in  health  expenditure.7  Incremental  benefits  are \nvalued using (i) willingness to pay. Values for potable water consumption are based on the cost \nof potable water for a minimum drinking requirement but only for the highest 10 percent income \ngroup among the nonconnected households.8 Time savings for water collection and willingness \nto  pay  are  based  on  the  social  survey.  Health  benefits  are  calculated  based  on  the  avoided \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n                                                 \n5  The SERF was estimated at 1.4 based on the prevailing official rate and the commercial rate as of February 2002. \n\nSensitivity analysis assumed the SERF to be 2.1 based on the market rate. \n\n6  Nontechnical  losses  add  to  the  welfare  of  population  served  and  estimated  to  be  20  liters  per  capita  per  day  for \nBozatau and  10 in Koshkupir. (ADB. 1999. Handbook for Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. p. \n65). \n\n7    Incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  is  caused  by  (1)  high  salinity  levels  of  water  from  boreholes  and  river  canals \nparticularly in Karakalpakstan, and (2) water contamination due to corroded conditions of pipes and lack of proper \nstructure for existing hand pumps and boreholes.  \n\n8  Potable water is purchased from other districts by households on regular scheduled bus trips. \n\n\f63\n\nResults \n\n            Appendix 12, page 3  \n\n  \n \ntreatment  costs,  using official health statistics on the impact of water supply improvements on \nthe  incidence  of  the  three  most  common  waterborne  diseases  and  the  cost  of  medical \ntreatment, including supplies from local hospitals. \n \nG. \n \n8. \nIn the two sample subproject districts, the EIRRs exceed the EOCC, which is assumed \nto  be  12  percent.  Sensitivity  analysis,  conducted  for  a  10  percent  increase  in  capital  and \noperating costs, and 10 percent reduction in subproject benefits, is summarized in Table A12. \nAnother standard sensitivity scenario assumes a one-year delay in benefits. Even at the worst \ncase  scenario,  which  combines  a  10  percent  decrease  in  benefits  and  10  percent  increase  in \ncosts, the subprojects are still feasible with EIRRs above 12 percent.  The resulting EIRRs are \nrobust  and  subprojects  are  economically  viable  even  in  the  combined  worst  case  scenario.  \nSwitching  values  and  sensitivity  indicators  are  also  calculated.  The  results  indicate  that  the \nEIRRs of subprojects are most sensitive to a decline in project benefits.  \n \n9. \nTwo  additional  project-specific  sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken:  (i)  increases  in  the \nvalue of the SERF to reflect the difference between the current market exchange rate and the \nofficial rate; and (ii) capital and O&M costs increase by 40 percent. The EIRRs in both districts \nexceed the EOCC of 12 percent. The results show that the SERF will have to increase by about \n30 percent for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC. The second sensitivity test assumes that the \ncapital  and  incremental  O&M  costs  will  increase  by  40  percent  considering  the  possible \nconstruction delays and relatively lower operational efficiencies. Again, the EIRRs remain above \nthe EOCC.

The calculated EIRRs are expected to be lower than the true EIRR since the \neconomic, social, and environmental implications of not undertaking the Project are severe and \nworsen rural poverty in the project area.  \n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 1 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction, Background, and Scope \n\nThe financial analysis is undertaken in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n\nA. \n \n1. \nguidelines, including the Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. \n \nThe agrovodokanals (rural water supply agencies) in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm are \n2. \nresponsible for rural water supply and sanitation in the provincial districts.1 Government policy \nfor agrovodokanals currently allows provision of subsidy for capital and operating requirements, \nalthough  it  is  simultaneously  promoting  market  principles  in  the  provision  of  communal \nservices.2  However, the current financial situation of the agrovodokanals is poor, mainly due to \n(i) low tariffs, (ii) unaccounted-for-water of about 50 percent,3 (iii) low revenue collection rates, \n(iv) rising costs, and (v) cash-flow problems. The Project seeks to reverse the downward spiral \nof  poor  service  delivery,  low  efficiency  in  tariff  collection,  underfunding,  and  aging  and \ndeteriorating assets to enable agrovodokanals to become self-financing and sustainable in the \nlong term. \n \n3. \nA financial analysis was undertaken of the two sample subproject districts of Bozatau in \nKarakalpakstan and Koshkupir in Khorezm. The analysis calculates tariffs required for operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  and  capital  cost  recovery,  undertakes  a  financial  appraisal  of  project \ncomponents in each district, and provides financial projections for the two agrovodokanals at the \ndistrict  level.  However,  due  to  the  limited  customer  base  of  agrovodokanals  and  the  poor \neconomic  conditions,  a  more  realistic  approach  is  for  tariff  recovery  to  fund  O&M  only.  The \nGovernment will need to continue with its current policy of subsidizing both the capital and some \noperating  requirements  of  agrovodokanals  to  sustain  the  improved  levels  of  service.  This \nsubsidy will include the indirect subsidy provided by the discounted rate charged for bulk water \nsupplied  from  the  Tuyamuyun  source.4  Nevertheless  the  agrovodokanals  must  comply  with \noperating  and  financial  efficiency  requirements  in  the  medium  term.  This  will  enhance  their \nrevenue generating capacity and encourage them to practice better water demand management \npractices. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nCalculated  full  cost  recovery  tariffs  are  calibrated  against  the  affordability  of  the  rural \npoor,  which  dictates  the  required  level  of  long-term  capital  and  operating  subsidies.  Tariff \nestimates are based on the proposals to introduce metered volume charging by 2006.5 Tariffs \n\nTariff Setting and Cost Recovery  \n\n                                                 \n1  In  Karakalpakstan,  the  agrovodokanal  operations  are  centralized  and  cover  all  15  districts.  In  Khorezm,  a \ndecentralized  management  of  rural  water  supply  exists,  with  each  of  the  11  districts  having  staff  responsible  for \nproviding the district\u2019s water supply requirements.  \n\n2  Resolution No. 243 allows for full recovery of operation and maintenance costs as a minimum requirement without \nexcluding the option to charge higher tariff to cover part of the capital cost. This policy will be implemented over a \nnumber of years. However, achieving full cost recovery for services to the rural communities that are suffering from \neconomic hardships as a consequence of the drought will be difficult.  \n\n3   Unaccounted for water estimate is based on the Demand Management and Loss Reduction Study conducted by \n\nthe Ministry of Macroeconomic and Statistics in August 2000. \n\n4  Interregional trunk main supplies based on raw water abstraction from the Amudarya River at Tuyamuyun. \n5  The  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau-financed  rural  water  project  indicated  that  in  2000,  a  realistic  tariff  (assuming \nthe rural water supply systems are functioning well) would be in the range of SUM200 per month per household, \nplus inflation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 2 \n\nFinancial Appraisal  \n\n \nwill cover O&M expenditure in a phased manner, but will not cover interest on the ADB loan.6 \nO&M  cost  estimates  are  based  on  improvements  in  efficiency  of  operation,  particularly  in  the \nvolume of water produced and effective maintenance requirements.  Water demand is based on \nthe  estimated  daily  consumption  for  domestic  use  only,  although  in  Karakalpakstan,  this  does \ninclude an allowance for cattle. Unaccounted for water is assumed to reduce from a current 50 \npercent to 30 percent as a result of project works. Resulting from the improved service delivery, \nthe tariff collection rate is assumed to be 60 percent in the early years after project completion, \nrising to 75 percent by 2010.  \n \n5. \nThe proposed average tariffs per cubic meter in 2006 (in constant prices) are SUM30 in \nBozatau  and  SUM40  in  Koshkupir  (equivalent  to  about  $0.043  and  $0.057  at  the  official \nexchange rate).7 Since existing tariffs are based on normative consumption, comparing existing \nand  proposed  tariffs  is  difficult.  However,  comparisons  of  existing  and  proposed  household \ncharges are shown in the affordability analysis.  Required tariff levels are sensitive to changes in \nproduction,  consumption,  losses,  tariff  collection  rates,  actual  costs,  and  inflation  among  other \nfactors, and hence tariff reviews must take place regularly, and appropriate tariffs implemented, \nboth during project construction and beyond 2006.  \n \nC. \n \nProject financial appraisal for each district, compares the financial internal rate of return \n6. \n(FIRR)8  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.1  percent.9    Sensitivity  tests  are \nundertaken  to  assess  the  impact  on  the  FIRR  of  cost  increases,  revenue  decreases,  and \ncurrency  depreciation.  Switching  values  and  sensitivity  indicators  are  also  calculated.  The \nappraisal  is  undertaken  in  2002  prices.  Project  capital  expenditure  is  estimated  based  on  the \nimplementation  schedule  and  includes  physical  contingencies  of  10  percent  for  all  items. \nReplacement costs are included for all operating equipment being needed 15 years after project \ncompletion. O&M costs include only the incremental costs incurred under the Project.  \n \n7. \nRevenues  are  estimated  based  on  the  required  average  tariff,  predicted  water \nconsumption,  and  a  collection  rate  of  60  percent.  Tariffs  are  assumed  to  stay  constant  in  real \nterms after 2006, but revenues increase along with increases in water consumption. The FIRRs \nare 3.9 percent in Bozatau and 5.1 percent in Koshkupir. These reflect the required Government \nsubsidy  for  the  capital  and  operating  requirements.  With  Government  subsidies  plus  direct \nrevenues, incomes exceed the weighted average cost of capital of 2.1 percent, demonstrating \nthat at proposed, affordable tariff levels the Project can be financially viable (Table A13.1). The \noverall FIRR is 4.6 percent.  \n \n8. \nStandard  sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  on  key  assumptions  in  the  analysis.  The \nresults indicate the Project is most sensitive to a decline in water sales or tariff collection, and a \nfurther  test  was  undertaken  for  a  15  percent  decrease  in  revenue.  Even  so,  the  Project  was \n\n                                                 \n6  The ADB loan which covers part of the capital works will be paid by the Government and the agrovodokanals will \nnot assume any liability related thereto but will be responsible to ensure that the capital assets of the Project are \ngiven proper and adequate maintenance. \n\n7  In  2001,  the  average  tariff  levels  in  Bozatau  and  Koshkupir  for  domestic  users  were  SUM14.7  and  SUM22.7 \n\nrespectively.   \n\n8  The FIRR calculation uses project capital costs and additional O&M costs associated with the Project. \n9  The WACC is calculated based on the cost of borrowing from ADB and counterpart funds. The cost of ADB funds \nare calculated at 2.5 percent of the foreign cost component and discounted at international inflation of 2.4 percent. \nThe cost of counterpart funds is assumed to be 5 percent over the rate of inflation in line with Government rates for \nlong-term lending.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 3 \n\nfound  to  be  financially  viable  under  all  the  adverse  cost  and  revenue  scenarios.

The  projected  financial  statements  are  in  current  prices  that  include \ninflation  in  each  year.11  For  purposes  of  analysis,  project  assets  are  valued  using  the \ncommercial exchange rate and are assumed to accumulate as work in progress in line with the \nimplementation  schedule.  The  opening  balance  is  based  on  balance  sheets  provided  by  the \nagrovodakanals  for  2001.12  Fixed  project  assets  are  depreciated  at  a  rate  of  2.5  percent  per \nannum for pipe networks, 10 percent for meters, and 5.0 percent for other assets, on a declining \nbalance.  Accounts  payable  represent  10  percent  of  operating  expenses.  Seventy  percent  of \nnonoperational revenue is assumed to be zero. \n \n10. \nThe  value-added  tax  is  calculated  at  an  average  of  20  percent  on  actual  income.  The \ncollection  rate  is  assumed  to  be  60  percent  rising  to  75  percent  after  project  completion.  \nRevenue for the years up to 2006 is based on actual current income, increasing at an annual \nrate of about 15 percent.

Since  revenue  is  dependent  on  tariff \ncollection, the actual operating service requirement is critical to the financial sustainability of the \nagrovodokanal  and  the  Project  must,  therefore,  focus  on  service  delivery.  Agrovodokanal \nexpenditure  is  expected  to  remain  constant  in  real  terms  until  2006  but  thereafter  fixed  and \nvariable  costs  for  water  are  calculated  based  on  production  volumes.  From  2006,  a  moderate \nprofit should occur with improved financial ratios. The Government has agreed that O&M costs \nwill receive priority, and only when they have been met will any remaining revenue by released \nfor capital and loan repayments.  \n \n12. \nOn the data available and assumptions as described, the agrovodokanals are shown to \nbe able to cover O&M expenses in about 10 years, with income covering realistic and adequate \nrequirements  for  maintenance  and  repair.  Under  these  conditions,  the  agrovodokanals  appear \nto be sustainable in the long term. Summary ratios are shown in Table A13.2.

Since metered charging \nwill  be  introduced  under  the  Project,  a  tariff  structure  was  prepared  for  each  district  using  a \nstepped  tariff  by  volume  and  lifeline  tariff  for  minimum  consumption  of  10  cubic  meters  per \nhousehold per month to increase affordability of the rural poor. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nProposed  average  tariffs  are  calculated  using  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery  of \noperation and maintenance (O&M). However, since affordability of tariffs is a critical issue in the \ndrought-stricken  areas  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm,  the  Government  has  committed  to \ncontinue  subsidizing  rural  water  supply  until  the  agrovodokanals  can  fully  recover  the  cost  of \nO&M  from  users.    In  addition,  once  meters  are  installed  under  the  Project,  charging  rural \ncustomers  by  volume  but  stepping \nis \nrecommended.2  This  will  encourage  demand  management  and  appropriate  water  use,  and \nreduce wastage. Setting a low tariff for low consumption is termed a \u201clifeline\u201d tariff as it assists \nthose with low income to have a subsistence consumption of water at affordable price.  \n \n3. \nThe tariff structure includes for residential customers: a lifeline tariff set at 60 liters per \ncapita per day (lcd), a tariff for consumption between 61 lcd and 75 lcd, and a higher tariff for \nconsumption over 75 lcd. The objectives of volume tariff structuring are to guarantee access of \nlower income households to  piped water and to encourage efficient water use by higher income \nconsuming households, and thus, ensure reduction of water loss from leaks and wasteful use. \n \n4. \nfor  domestic  water \nconsumption  levels  in  the  two  sample  subproject  districts  of  Bozatau  in  Karakalpakstan  and \nKoshkipur  in  Khorezm  is  shown  in  Table  A14.  The  proportion  of  these  charges  to  household \nincomes  is  also  shown.  The  household  charge  for  average  water  consumption  satisfies  ADB \ncriteria since it accounts for a maximum of less than 5 percent of average household income. \nFor those with the lowest incomes, the water charge is lower than 5 percent of income if water \nconsumption is limited to around the lifeline consumption level. The social research showed that \nabout 73 percent of respondents in Bozatau and about 85 percent in Koshkupir were willing to \npay for water supply improvements. Of those respondents who were willing to pay, the average \nwas about SUM280 in Bozatau and SUM320 in Koshkupir per household per month. Proposed \nhousehold charges are in line with these levels.  \n \n5. \nProposed  water  tariffs  per  cubic  meter  are  in  the  range  of  SUM20  for  Bozatau  and \nSUM25 for Koshkupir. These levels represent a reasonable increase compared with the current \ntariffs  of  SUM10  for  Bozatau  and  SUM18  for  Koshkupir,  since  current  tariffs  have  been \nincreased to take account of inflation. The analysis shows keeping tariffs at about 3 percent of \nhousehold  income,  this  means  that  required  tariff  increases  remain  affordable  in  Bozatau  and \nKoshkupir.  \n                                                 \n1  Social  research  included  social  surveys,  field  visits,  and  focus  groups  discussions  in  the  sample  subproject        \n\nA  detailed  comparison  of  existing  and  proposed  charges \n\ndistricts. \n\n2  The  World  Bank  Water  Supply  project  has  been  undertaking  metering  of  household  consumption  in  the  district \ncenters.  A  detailed  stepped  tariff  structure  based  on  size  of  meters  installed  has  been  proposed  to  the \nGovernment. Once metered volumes become available, the demand information will be used to assist in designing \nan appropriate tariff structures in the project areas. \n\n\fTable A14:  Tariff Structure and Affordability\n\nDomestic Tariffs\n\nDaily Per Capita Water \nConsumption \n\nA.

The \n1. \naverage  per  capita  monthly  income  in  2001  was  estimated  at  SUM9,710.1  The  Government \nuses the concept of \u201cleast provided families\u201d to identify those needing support for basic human \nneeds.  The  main  indicator  is  income  per  family  member,  including  additional  criteria  of  asset \nownership. In Government terms, the poor are classified as a vulnerable and low-income group \nbased on the prevailing official minimum wage, which is adjusted regularly for inflation, and in \nJanuary  2002  was  set  at  SUM3,430  per  month.2  In  a  recent  study  by  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit, Tacis, and the World Bank, minimum wage was used to assess \nthe  poverty  level  in  Tashkent,  Ferghana,  and  Karakalpakstan.  Based  on  the  minimum  wage \ncriteria,  urban  poverty  in  these  areas  was  estimated  at  10,  28,  and  50  percent,  respectively. \nRural poverty is expected to be higher. In the same survey, self-ranked poverty (i.e., not having \nenough  money  for  food  and  medicines)  in  these  areas  ranged  from  30  to  70  percent  of  the \npopulation depending on the location. Using the World Bank definition of poverty of $1 per day, \neven at the official exchange rate, would put the average income in Uzbekistan at approximately \ntwo thirds of the $1 a day level. This indicates that the majority of the population in the country is \npoor.    \n \nB. \n \n2. \nIncome  and  expenditure  data  for  2000  and  2001  show  that  the  average  per  capita \nannual  money  income  was  SUM116,520  and  expenditure  was  SUM102,600,  an  equivalent  of \nSUM9,710  and  SUM8,550  per  month.  However,  the  national  average  hides  wide  variations \nbetween  Tashkent  City  and  other  provinces,  particularly  the  poorer  regions  such  as \nKarakalpakstan, where income and expenditure levels are much lower. About 80 percent of the \npopulation in Karakalpakstan and 60 percent in Khorezm were unemployed in 2001. The annual \nper  capita  income  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  in  2001  was  estimated  at  SUM54,430  and \nSUM63,770 respectively. Based on the socioeconomic survey undertaken in February 2002, the \nmonthly  household  income  and  expenditure  in  the  sample  subproject  district  of  Bozatau  in \nKarakalpakstan  were  SUM15,900  and  SUM15,560.  The  corresponding  figures  in  the  sample \nsubproject  district  of  Koshkupir  in  Khorezm  were  SUM18,900  and  SUM  18,780.3  Average  per \ncapita monthly income was SUM3,180 in Bozatau and SUM4,110 in Koshkupir, as compared to \nthe minimum wage of SUM3,430 per capita per month. \n \n\nIncome in the Project Area \n\nTable A15: Income and Consumer Expenditure \n\n \n \nLocation \n \nNational Average \nKarakalpakstan \nKhorezm \nBozatau (Karakalpakstan) \nKoshkupir (Khorezm) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nPer Capita \nMoney Income \n(annual)  \n2001 \n116,520 \n54,430 \n63,770 \n38,160 \n49,320 \n\nConsumer \nExpenditure \n(annual) \n2001 \n102,600 \n47,880 \n56,080 \n37,800 \n47,760 \n\nPer Capita \nMoney Income \n(per month) \n2001 \n9,710 \n4,536 \n5,314 \n3,180 \n4,110 \n\nConsumer \nExpenditure\n(per month) \n2001 \n8,550 \n3,990 \n4,674 \n3,150 \n3,980 \n\n                                                      \n1   Based on Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics preliminary income and expenditure estimates for 2001. \n2  Due to high inflation, the real value of the minimum wage is less. \n3   Consumer expenditure is used as the comparative measure of wealth. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 15, page 2  \n\nLoan Classification \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\nApproach to Poverty Impact Analysis \n\nC. \n \n3. \nIn  the  absence  of  an  official  poverty  line,  the  minimum  wage  of  SUM3,430  per  capita \nwas  used  to  calculate  the  percentage  of  poor  beneficiaries.  This  has  been  the  criterion  being \nused  by  other  international  funding  agencies  for  assessing  poverty  in  Karakalpakstan.  Using \nincome alone provides a relatively narrow definition of poverty, and tend to ignore the economic, \ncultural,  and  social  situation  in  the  project  area,  as  well  as  nonmonetary  benefits  and \nunregistered income. Given the economic situation in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, particularly \nin the rural areas, where a large portion of people\u2019s income from agriculture has been lost due \nto the drought, the use of the national minimum wage is a conservative measure of the level of \npoverty in the project area.  \n \nD. \n \n4. \nBased  on  a  poverty  line  of  SUM3,430  per  capita  per  month  and  the  social  research \nresults,4 over 60 percent of project beneficiaries are poor. This includes 80 percent in Bozatau \nand  55  percent  in  Koshkupir  district.  The  loan  is  therefore  classified  as  a  core  poverty \nintervention since the proportion of beneficiaries classified as poor is above 50 percent. \n \nE. \n \n5. \nThe assessment of poverty impact used for this Project has considered (i) the extent to \nwhich  the  project  targets  areas  where  the  rural  poor  are  located,  (ii)  the  proportion  of  project \nbeneficiaries  who  are  poor,  (iii)  the  targeting  of  the  project  loan  toward  the  poor,  and  (iv)  the \nimpact on the quality of life of the poor. \n \n6. \nIdentification  of  the  poor  within  a  set  of  project  beneficiaries  is  possible  for  this  Project \nconsidering  that  the  project  area  is  rural  where  the  majority  of  the  population  have  limited \nincome  opportunities  due  to  depressed  economic  conditions  in  these  two  regions.  All  target \nbeneficiaries  will  benefit  from  the  improvements  to  the  water  supply  services.  The  benefits \ninclude access to safe and clean water, better health, time savings from fetching water for more \nproductive uses, and overall improvement to the livelihood of the population. \n \n7. \nUsing  a  poverty  line  of  SUM  3,430  per  capita  per  month,  the  proportion  of  poor \nhouseholds in the two sample project districts is over 60 percent. The majority of the Project\u2019s \nbeneficiaries are poor as they cannot afford to pay for alternatives. This situation will worsen if \nthe  Project  does  not  go  ahead  as  the  source  of  water  continues  to  deplete,  and  the \ninfrastructure facilities continue to deteriorate such that water supply will decease entirely. \n \n8. \nThe loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides 58.5 percent of the project \ncosts.  The  funds  will  be  targeted  at  project  beneficiaries,  over  60  percent  of  whom  are  poor. \nBased on this, at least $22.8 million of the funds will be targeted to the rural poor. \n \n9. \nPoverty  impact  is  also  measured  in  terms  of  quality  of  life  related  to  a  definition  of  an \nacceptable  rural  living  standard  including  access  to  basic  services  such  as  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities, all of which are included in the ADB objective of poverty reduction. For this \nProject  the  acceptable  rural  living  standard  is  assumed  to  be  when  the  population  is  able  to \naccess clean water to meet their basic needs such as drinking and washing. The poor quality of \n\n                                                      \n4  Research included a socioeconomic survey, field visits, and focus group discussions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 15, page 3  \n\nwater and the cost of treating the water for consumption are also taken into account.5 Further, \nthese problems have limited the economic potential of the area, aggravating poverty conditions.6 \n \n10. \nQuality  of  life  measures  for  households  appropriate  for  the  water  supply  component  of \nthis  Project  include  (i)  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  (ii)  access  to  washing  facilities,  (iii) \nmorbidity  level  due  to  exposure  to  waterborne  disease,  (iv)  cost  of  making  water  potable,  and \n(v) proportion of the day spent collecting water (i.e., loss of productive time) and storage. Area \ntargeting of low-income households is achieved under the Project with lower income households \nprovided  access  to  safe  drinking  water  that  is  affordable.  Service  standards  will  be  upgraded \nresulting in improved water quality that will have a positive impact on the health conditions of the \nrural  population.  This  situation  will  enable  the  rural  poor  to  save  on  medical  costs.  These  will \nhave  long-term  implications  in  mitigating  poverty  where  families  become  less  vulnerable  to \nsickness and more involved with productive work. Children\u2019s education will be more secure and \nimproved sanitary conditions in schools will be more conducive for learning. \n \n11. \nThe Project will also provide opportunities for women to use their time more productively \nsince they will not have to spend a large amount of time fetching water. Small- and medium-size \nbusinesses are likely to improve productivity with a continuous supply of water. The Project will \nalso  create  construction  job  opportunities  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  the \nimplementation stage. The Project will create about 600 person-months of skilled employment \nand about 800 person-months of unskilled employment. \n \nF. \n \nOver  60  percent  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are  poor,  and  at  least  $22.8  million  of  the \n12. \nloan will be targeted to them. Providing access to safe water will improve the quality of life of the \nrural  poor,  who  are  more  vulnerable  to  lack  of  water  supply.  The  Project  will  reduce  both  the \nmonetary and nonmonetary effects of acute water shortage, which perpetuate the poverty cycle \nof  the  rural  poor.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  objective,  which  is  to \nachieve  100  percent  piped  water  service  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  in  Karakalpakstan \nKhorezm,  and  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  people  in  these  two  regions  that  have  been \nsuffering from the Aral Sea water problem.  \n\nConclusion \n\n                                                      \n5  The  poor  and  declining  surface  water  quality  due  to  salinity  attributable  to  extensive  upstream  irrigation  in  the \nAmudarya  basin,  and  wasteful  irrigation  and  poor  drainage  practices  in  Karakalpakstan  have  compounded  the \nproblem  of  the  lack  of  good  quality  water  for  domestic  use.  Other  water  sources  such  as  shallow  wells  do  not \nprovide a stable water supply as the level of water in these wells is subject to seasonal variations and many have \ndried  up  because  of  the  drought.  Groundwater  when  available  is  often  of  high  mineral  content  and  requires \ndesalination before it becomes potable. \n\n6  The  rural  poor  despite  receiving  some  form  of  social  stipends  such  as  pensions,  unemployment  support,  and \nsupport  for  mothers  with  infants,  need  to  earn  extra  cash  income  from  private  production  of  farm  products. \nHowever,  land  productivity  has  declined  considerably  due  to  lack  of  water  and  little  income  is  derived  from  land \ncultivation. Many poor households have to sell their limited assets to buy food, clothing, and other necessities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 March 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nSUM1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Sum (SUM) \n$0.00144 \nSUM693  \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncommunity-based organization \neconomic internal rate of return \neconomic opportunity cost of capital \nfinancial internal rate or return \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nliter per capita per day \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Macroeconomics and Statistics \nnongovernment organization \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nproject steering committee \nshadow exchange rate factor \ntechnical assistance \nTerritorial Communal Services Agency \nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund \nUnited States Agency for International Development \nwater distribution center \n", "ADB \nCBO \nEIRR \nEOCC \nFIRR \nJFPR \nlcd \nLIBOR \nMMS \nNGO \nO&M \nPIU \nPMU \nPSC \nSERF \nTA \nTCSA \nUCSA \nUNICEF \nUSAID \nWDC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Agrovodokanal \nMahalla \nVodokanal \n", "rural water and sewerage agency \nlocal self-management civil committee \nurban water and sewerage agency \n", " \nGLOSSARY \n \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Uzbekistan ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "                                                                                                        1 \n", "                                                                                            1 \n", " \n", "BACKGROUND                                                                                                                 1 \n         1 \n \nA. \n         7 \n \nB.  \n         8 \n \nC.  \n         9  \n \nD.  \n       10 \n \nE.  \n       10  \n \nF.  \n", "Sector Description \nGovernment Policies and Plans \nExternal Assistance to the Sector  \nLessons Learned \n \nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \nPolicy Dialogue \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "CONTENTS \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "THE PROPOSAL  \n", "INTRODUCTION    \n", " \n \nLOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY    \n \nMAP \n \nl. \n \nll.   \n \nlll. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlV. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nV.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nVl.  \n \n \n \n \n \nVll.
