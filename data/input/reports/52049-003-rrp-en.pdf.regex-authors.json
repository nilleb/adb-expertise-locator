THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased  loan  (PBL)  to  the Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan for  subprogram  2  of the  Trade  and \nCompetitiveness Program.1 \n \n2.  The program will help Pakistan recover its current account deficit in a sustained manner \nand promote macroeconomic stability by facilitating improved trade competitiveness and exports. \nThe program will (i) introduce important tariff and tax-related policy reforms to support Pakistan\u2019s \nexport industry and improve its competitiveness internationally; and (ii) strengthen key institutions \ninvolved in facilitating trade, including accreditation bodies, the Export\u2013Import Bank of Pakistan \n(EXIMBP), and the Pakistan Single Window (PSW). The proposed reforms will also facilitate \nexport diversification. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  From  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017  to  FY2019,  Pakistan  faced  severe  macroeconomic \nmanagement challenges because of (i) a rapidly expanding fiscal deficit; (ii) a large balance-of-\npayments gap and critically low foreign exchange reserves caused by eroding competitiveness, \nan overvalued exchange rate, and lack of export diversification; and (iii) growing losses from \nseveral major state-owned enterprises, including burgeoning energy sector debt resulting from \nuntargeted  and  unfunded  subsidies  and  operational inefficiencies.  Pakistan\u2019s  export  growth \naveraged more than 10% annually from FY2004 to FY2011, peaking at $25.4 billion in FY2011 \nbefore flattening during FY2011\u2013FY2015. Exports fell to $22.0 billion in FY2016 and FY2017 (as \nreflected in almost all major export groups and most destinations), recovered to $24.8 billion in \nFY2018, and declined again to $22.5 billion in FY2020. The rise-and-fall pattern during FY2004\u2013\nFY2020 reveals the underperformance of the country\u2019s export industry and a long-term decline of \nits export competitiveness. The export performance lags that of South Asian and Southeast Asian \ncomparator countries, some of which are relatively new entrants in key export markets, such as \nBangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Pakistan\u2019s ratio of exports to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of 10.1% in 2019 was by far the lowest among its competitor countries, and lower \nthan the regional average (South Asia) of 17.6%. \n \n4.  The current government, which took office in August 2018, prepared a comprehensive \neconomic recovery program to address the issues related to poor macroeconomic management \nand approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance. On 3 July 2019, the \nexecutive  board  of  the  IMF  approved  a  39-month  extended  arrangement  under  the  IMF\u2019s \nExtended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan.2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) participated in \ndeveloping  the  economic  recovery  program  and  provided  PBLs  to  support  comprehensive \nreforms to improve macroeconomic management,  including  export competitiveness.3 These \nreform initiatives led to considerable improvements in Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic management \n \n1  The programmatic approach and subprogram 1 were approved on 7 August 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic performance at a critical \njuncture in its macroeconomic recovery program. A major channel of impact is manufacturing \nproduction, which has affected the economy because of three main reasons: (i) demand from \nhigh-income countries for manufacturing goods and raw materials is decreasing; (ii) value chains \nare being disrupted by delays in the delivery of necessary components and supplies from more \ntechnologically advanced countries; and (iii) other factors, including policies (e.g., restrictions on \nthe movement of goods and people). The inability of employees to reach their workplaces and \nfinancial constraints are affecting the normal production process. The pandemic is also affecting \nPakistan\u2019s economy through other important channels such as lower tourism and business travel. \n \n6.  In the trade areas, under subprogram 1, the Government of Pakistan achieved several \nreforms. Tariffs and ad hoc duties on a large number of raw materials and the intermediate goods \nwere  either  reduced  or  abolished  (Figure  1).  Several  steps  were taken  to  (i) introduce  e-\nCommerce; (ii) operationalize PSW, and the EXIMBP; and (iii) strengthen the export certification \nprocess. However, exports also lost their growth momentum because of the pandemic (Table 2).4 \nThe low resilience of Pakistan\u2019s export industry to unanticipated shocks is also reflected in its \ninability to diversify its export range.5 Exports are concentrated on less-sophisticated and lower \n \n4  The sharp downturn in international trade has also adversely affected South Asian countries as export orders have \nbeen canceled or suspended for major labor-intensive products such as garments, leather footwear, handicrafts, and \nshrimp from South Asian countries, causing widespread output and job losses.

However, health supplies, \nparticularly from the People\u2019s Republic of China, registered good export growth. This is also corroborated in ADB. \n2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. Regarding exports of leather \nproducts, the implementation of regulations related to the testing of products across different countries has become \nmore stringent, and buyers are asking exporters to get their products tested from approved labs. The decline in \nPakistan\u2019s leather industry during the first 8 months of FY2020 was because of issues faced by exporters in getting \ntheir products tested by local labs. In addition, buyers have become concerned about the environmental issues and \nare specific about certain chemicals that are used in leather products. Few of the chemicals have been banned and \nthe exporters have to replace them with more expensive chemicals that have deteriorated the competitiveness of \nPakistan\u2019s leather products. \n5  A lack of economic and trade diversification is often associated with increased vulnerability to external shocks that \ncan undermine prospects for stable growth in the long run.

This is evident from the dominance \nof  agricultural  products,  textiles,  and  leather  goods  in  the  share  of  total  exports.  Textiles \ncomprised 56.23% of Pakistan\u2019s goods\u2019 exports during FY2015\u2013FY2020; their export value grew \nby an annual average of 7.10% during FY2004\u2013FY2011 but dropped by an annual average of \n0.25% during FY2011\u2013FY2019. Pakistan is losing its export competitiveness because of the high \nconcentration on goods with low sophistication, and because the share of high-tech products in \nits  total  exports  is  less  than  2%.

Maintaining robust export growth is also important to sustain a low current account deficit \nand reasonable foreign exchange reserves.6 Pakistan's gross international reserves fell from \n$19.4 billion at the end of FY2016 to $11.3 billion at the end of FY2018 and fell further to $9.3 \nbillion at the end of FY2019 (Table 3), the main reasons being (i) the increasing current account \ndeficit, (ii) interventions by the government to maintain the overvalued exchange rate, and (iii) \nincreasing debt service payments.

Despite \nadverse macroeconomic impacts because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government\u2019s efforts \nto ensure macroeconomic stability continue, and the early results are encouraging in FY2021. \nThe current account balance registered a surplus of $738 million in the first quarter of FY2021 \nagainst a deficit of $3 billion in FY2020. The Federal Board of Revenue mobilized $6.1 billion of \nrevenue during the first quarter of FY2021 against a target of $5.9 billion. Exports registered a \npositive growth in September 2020 (4%) after year-over-year negative growth rate in July and \nAugust. Poor growth in exports during the first quarter of FY2021 was primarily driven by food \nexports, especially wheat, due to the adverse impact of the locust invasion. The fiscal deficit-to-\nGDP ratio of 8.1% during FY2020 was lower than during FY2019 (8.8%) and was lower than the \nearlier estimate (9.2%) made in April 2020. The government continues to implement critical \nreforms under the Trade and Competitiveness Program and in the areas covering capital markets \nand the energy sector with support from ADB and other development partners.7 Reforms in the \narea of economic management were also implemented under the World Bank\u2019s budget support \nprograms.8 The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  implemented several  reforms  during  FY2020  to \nimprove public financial management. Under the provisions of the Public Finance Management \nAct 2019, the MOF presented a midyear budget review report in the National Assembly in June \n2020 and published a budget manual and budget strategy paper.

The MOF has \nstopped taking loans from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to finance its deficit. The SBP \ncontinues  its  data-driven  monetary  policy  responses  to  support  recovery  in  growth  and \nemployment while keeping inflation expectations low. The policy rate was reduced by 100 basis \npoints on 25 June (from 8% to 7%), part of a cumulative reduction of 625 basis points from mid-\nMarch 2020 to June 2020. The EFF program, initiated in 2019, was disrupted by the COVID-19 \npandemic. The IMF provided an additional $1.4 billion under its Rapid Financing Instrument in \nApril  2020  to  ensure that the  EFF  program  targets  are  not compromised  or  derailed.  The \ngovernment and the IMF have resumed technical discussions on completing selected structural \nbenchmarks. While substantial progress has been made on a wide range of benchmarks, more \nwork needs to be done in two areas: energy and tax reforms. Once the agreement is reached, \npending reviews will be combined to assess the compliance status of the structural benchmarks \nand continuous performance criteria; and recommend disbursement of the pre-identified program \ntranches. \n \n9.  The  programmatic  approach  and  the  role  of  subprogram  2.  Subprogram  2  is \nembedded in a programmatic approach (combining two subprograms) to facilitate implementation \nof key reforms in a sequential manner, which will strengthen the export sector\u2019s competitiveness \nand  facilitate  trade  diversification.  There  are  three  requirements  for  successful  trade \ndiversification  and  improved  competitiveness  that  are  expected  to  improve  resilience  to \nunanticipated shocks: (i) provision of an appropriate incentive structure through rationalization of \ninput costs,  (ii)  investments  and  policy  reforms targeted  at  strengthening  key  trade-related \ninstitutions and reducing trade costs, and (iii) government interventions directed at institutional \nfailures.9 Effective  policies  to  support  improved  trade  competitiveness  and  reallocation  of \nresources toward product diversification should therefore address the major constraining factors, \nwhich encompass (i) a distorted incentive structure because of high input costs, (ii) low investment \nin research and development, (iii) weak trade facilitation institutions, and (iv) high financial \nintermediation costs for entrepreneurs (especially new entrepreneurs). The reforms proposed \nunder this programmatic approach (combining both subprograms 1 and 2) encompass all these \nareas. Moreover, reforms were designed in a phased manner for implementation over two \nsubprograms.  Implementation  of  some  critical  reforms  will  continue  with  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance (TA) support under the post-program partnership framework (P3F). These reforms are \nbroadly categorized into two groups (paras. 10\u201312). \n \n10.  High raw material costs had an adverse impact on exports. High tariffs and duties on \nthe import of raw materials including synthetic products and man-made fibers continue to restrict \nPakistani manufacturers from producing high value-added products including synthetic textiles \n(including finished garments) and products to meet trends in global demand. This constrains \npotential export value growth and results in underperformance of textile exports. Instead, Pakistan \nis competing with lower-income countries exporting low-tech products at more competitive wage \nrates.10 \n \n11.  Poor institutional capacities eroded Pakistan\u2019s export potential. The export sector \nhas also suffered from persistent high costs of doing business in Pakistan stemming from outages \nof grid-based electricity, the high cost of electricity, and high tax incidence on petroleum products \n \n9  World Bank Group. 2019.

Manila. \n ", "6 \n(including  diesel  fuel). Further, the  government  withheld the  refund  of taxes  and  duties to \nexporters and this adversely affected the liquidity of exporters. Complex and cumbersome official \nprocedures, including customs procedures for exporters and importers, also create high costs of \ndoing  business.  This  emphasizes  the  need  to  streamline  border  control  and  documentary \nprocedures, and operationalize the single window system for exporters and importers. \n \n12.  The institutions and bodies established to provide essential trade-related services to \nexporters have inherent weaknesses, leading to high transaction costs. Institutions responsible \nfor metrology and product testing, certification services for export product quality, accreditation \nservices for testing bodies, intellectual property rights enforcement, and establishment of special \neconomic zones play a critical role in trade facilitation and competitiveness. However, these \ninstitutions lack capacity and are not efficient. Consequently, corporations and small businesses \nsuffer from a lack of quality services to comply with changes in world trade rules embodied in \ntechnical  barriers  to  trade  and  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures  of  the  World  Trade \nOrganization. For example, exports of many agricultural commodities suffer because of poor \ntesting and certification facilities. In addition, limited access to trade finance places many small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and other exporters at a disadvantage to international \ncompetitors that can access financial support from their country\u2019s national export credit agency, \nincluding credit enhancements, lower cost of financing, and insurance for extended payment \nterms. This bottleneck has imposed serious challenges to exporters, especially after the financial \ncrisis in 2008\u20132009. This can be improved through full operationalization of the EXIMBP.11 \nFinancing constraints are more serious for women entrepreneurs. The lack of financial capacity \nwas reported to be the major bottleneck for women entrepreneurs in surveys conducted during \n2015 and 2016.12 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n13.  The vision of the government\u2019s Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF), 2020\u20132025 is \nfor Pakistan to become a dynamic and efficient domestic market and a globally competitive \nexport-driven economy.13 To achieve sustainable rapid export growth, a comprehensive strategy \nhas been devised to (i) optimize the growth of existing export sectors in the short term, (ii) diversify \ninto new export sectors to be identified through stakeholder engagement in the medium term, and \n(iii)  identify the  innovation-driven  export sectors for support interventions  in  the  long term. \nPakistan Vision 2025 also articulates the government\u2019s aim to encourage trade, increase exports \nand improve the competitiveness of domestic industries in Pakistan to aid recovery of the current \naccount deficit, and promote macroeconomic stability and sustained high growth.14 The objectives \nof the STPF are to (i) make exports an effective driver for economic growth, (ii) reduce the relative \ndisincentive for exporting industries by removing structural anomalies, and (iii) improve the trade \n \n11 The World Bank commissioned a firm and bank survey on trade and trade finance developments in 14 developing \ncountries across five regions during the first quarter of 2009. The survey included 425 firms and 78 banks, and its \nfindings confirmed that the global financial crisis constrained trade finance for exporters and importers in developing \ncountries. The impact varied by firm size, sector activity, and countries\u2019 integration in the global economy. SMEs \nwere negatively affected, making export diversification more difficult, especially in low-income countries. M. \nMalouche. 2009.

", "7 \necosystem by increasing institutional efficiencies and reducing the cost of doing business. The \nmain goals of the STPF are to (i) attain an exports volume of $45 billion by FY2025;15 (ii) improve \ncompetitiveness and efficiency of the industry sector, especially the export sector, by ensuring \nlow tariffs on raw materials; (iii) promote young entrepreneurs for export diversification;16 and (iv) \npromote sustainable, socially compliant, inclusive, and gender-sensitive export development. \n \n14.  The program facilitates identification and implementation of key reforms to address the \ndevelopment challenges, as explained above, and to improve Pakistan\u2019s export performance.17 \nThe proposed reforms are logically sequenced, and grouped in two areas under the programmatic \napproach: \n(i)  Tax and tariff rationalization. The principal objective of this reform area is to \npromote a business environment enabling export competitiveness and facilitating \nprivate  sector  investment.  Price  competitiveness  will  be  enhanced  through \nabolition or reduction of several regulatory and customs duties on raw materials \nand intermediate inputs. Under subprogram 1, the government (a) submitted the \ndraft National Tariff Policy to the federal cabinet for approval; (b) rationalized the \ntariff rates into a maximum of four slabs, with a peak rate of 20%; (c) abolished or \nreduced customs and regulatory duties on several raw materials and intermediate \ninputs; and (d) reduced the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 29% for FY2019 \nto facilitate corporate investment and trade. These reforms will continue with \nfollow-up  policy  actions  proposed  for  subprogram  2  and  the  P3F.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government (a) approved the National Tariff Policy in November \n2019,  (b)  rationalized  further  customs  duties  for  several  raw  material  and \nintermediate inputs, and (c) removed the electricity surcharge of PRs3.35 per \nkilowatt-hour on industrial consumers. \n(ii)  Institutional strengthening. Rationalization of taxes, customs and regulatory \nduties, and tariffs alone cannot improve Pakistan\u2019s exports unless the legal and \ninstitutional structures relevant to trade are strengthened. Four important reform \nareas  are  targeted  under  the  program:  (a)  introducing  e-Commerce,  (b) \noperationalizing the PSW, (c) operationalizing the EXIMBP, and (d) strengthening \nthe system of certification and accreditation. Under subprogram 1, the government \n(a)  prepared  the  draft  e-Commerce  Policy  Framework;  (b)  approved  the \noperational rules for appointments, promotions, and transfers of employees of the \nPakistan National Accreditation Council (PNAC) (which published on the PNAC \nwebsite long-term plans, policies, and schemes in line with international best \npractices, including certification for export of gems and jewelry); (c) notified the \nhigh-level steering committee for PSW, the project management office, and five \nworking groups to promote export facilitation; (d) approved the PSW blueprint and \nimplementation plan to operationalize the PSW; (e) prepared the draft PSW Act, \nwhich  articulates  the  business  processes  of  the  PSW  in  accordance  with \ninternational legal standards and best practices, for stakeholder consultations; (f) \napproved specific amendments to the Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme \nfor Women Entrepreneurs in Underserved Areas to expand its applicability to all \n \n15 A more modest and feasible target is in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n16 The government\u2019s targeted programs for young entrepreneurs include the Kamyab Jawan Program and the \nRefinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs. The EXIMBP will also support young \nentrepreneurs. \n17 Effective collaboration between development partners and donors is essential to address infrastructure constraints \nthat raise trade and logistics costs. Efficient reallocation of resources across sectors and productive uses of these \nresources depend upon an appropriate incentive structure and access to finance, among other factors. These two \nfactors are critical to promote export diversification and provide encouragement to young entrepreneurs. \n ", "8 \ndistricts  of  Pakistan  and  to  allow  working  capital  financing  for  women \nentrepreneurs to improve their access to finance; and (g) initiated the process of \nrecruitment of a full-time professional chief executive officer for the EXIMBP. \nThese reforms will continue with policy actions proposed for subprogram 2. The \nimplementation  will  also  continue  and  be  monitored  under  the  P3F.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government (a) approved the e-commerce implementation \nstrategy;18  (b)  recommended  the  amendments  in  the  PNAC  Act,  2017  to \nreconstitute the board of directors of the PNAC to (1) include professionals with \nsector expertise and scientific knowledge, (2) restrict the ex officio board members \nto one-third of the total board members, (3) ensure at least one female board \nmember, and (4) fix the term for each member to 3 years (other than ex officio \nmembers); (c) ensured the approval of the short-term and long-term plans, policies, \nand schemes of the PNAC;19 (d) submitted the draft PSW Act to the Parliament for \napproval;  (e)  operationalized  Pakistan  Single  Window  Company  through  the \nfollowing  critical  steps:  (1)  issuance  of  a  certificate  of  incorporation  by  the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, (2) notification by the Federal \nBoard of Revenue on the transfer of the PSW\u2019s share of the goods declaration fee \nto the PSW, (3) notification by the competent authority to appoint the PSW\u2019s board \nof  directors,  (4)  approval  of  the  board  of  directors  for  appointment  of  core \nmanagement staff, (5) budget allocation for PSW in the Public Sector Development \nProgram for FY2021 after approval of the PSW project plan by the executive \ncommittee of the National Economic Council, and (6) approval of technical and \nbusiness  requirement specification  documentation for  PSW core  services;  (f) \napproved  an  integrated  risk management system  (IRMS)  for six  government \nagencies;20 (g) amended the Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women \nEntrepreneurs to increase the credit limit from PRs1.5 million to PRs5.0 million; \nand (h) approved the business and finance plans of the EXIMBP and published \nthe draft EXIMBP Act on the Finance Division website. \n \n15.  Revisions in subprogram 2 policy actions. There are two types of revisions in the \nsubprogram  2  policy  matrix  from  the  indicative  policy  matrix  proposed  during  approval  of \nsubprogram 1:21 \n(i)  A number of actions were strengthened further, better targeted, and streamlined \nfor effective and speedy implementation of the relevant reforms. For example, in \nthe case of strengthening, additional raw materials were brought under the tariff \nrationalization plan to provide more relief to exporters. Similarly, the policy actions \nrelated to the operationalization of the PSW were strengthened and better targeted \n \n18 The implementation plan emphasizes (i) developing an e-commerce portal to support single window operations, (ii) \nimproving regulations governing e-commerce, (iii) facilitating cross-border trade, (iv) easing processes governing \nremittances flow, (v) ensuring consumer protection and improving confidence, (vi) harmonizing the taxation structure, \nand (vii) integrating logistics in the e-commerce value chain. \n19 The PNAC\u2019s short-term plan envisages widening the PNAC\u2019s scope of recognition to include additional certifications, \nincluding  those  governing  medical  laboratories,  gems  and  jewelry,  food  safety  systems,  and  information \nmanagement. Under its long-term plan, the PNAC will strengthen its human resource and strategic locations across \nPakistan to (i) improve continuous surveillance as required under the International Organization for Standardization \n17011 standard (requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies) and (ii) increase \nthe number of conformity assessment bodies to 350 by 2025. \n20 The six agencies selected for the IRMS are the ones that have the mandate to hold cargo at ports, and thus can put \nclearance on hold, leading to port congestion. Most of the other agencies rely on post-clearance audits or \ninterventions off the port. These six agencies have been selected for the IRMS because of the number of transactions \nthey process for the first phase of the PSW. The time release studies also suggested prioritizing these agencies over \nothers for the PSW. \n21 Revisions in the Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nby selecting relevant actions needed for its speedy operationalization. Given that \ne-commerce involves crosscutting issues\u2014across departments as well as across \nfederal  and  provincial  governments\u2014a  single  piece  of  legislation  is  difficult \nbecause it might prompt the need for repeated amendments to make it consistent \nwith various provisions under the provincial acts and changing guidelines and rules \nfor  e-commerce.  Many  countries  with  a  federal  system  of  government  have \nacknowledged this problem.22 Therefore, this action was streamlined by preparing \nan implementation strategy, which was approved by the National e-Commerce \nCouncil. The draft EXIMBP Act was uploaded to the MOF website. \n(ii)  Actions related to further rationalization of the corporate tax rate and abolition of \nthe requirement to certify nonavailability of locally produced capital goods to make \nuse of duty-free imports were deferred to the P3F because of (a) the need to revive \neconomic activities subdued because of COVID-19 and (b) the losses of federal \nrevenue during FY2020 attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The P3F has been \ndesigned to ensure continuity of reforms. ADB\u2019s ongoing TA support will continue \nto facilitate implementation of some important initiatives (e.g., the e-commerce \nportal, the  PSW,  and  capacity development  in  the PNAC).  Monitoring of  the \ncontinuity  of  reforms  (and  avoidance  of  slippages)  as  well  as  TA  activities \nnecessitated the inclusion of the P3F in the design of the programmatic approach. \nThe P3F will also help ADB design future programs in these areas. \n \n16.  Sequencing of reforms will remain critical during subprograms 1 and 2 and the P3F. For \nexample, operationalization of the PSW and setting up of the EXIMBP will require a gradual \napproach.  Therefore,  a  programmatic  approach  supported  by  the  P3F  is  suitable  for \nchronologically sequencing the reforms in a multiyear framework. It also enables alignment of \npolicy actions with unavoidable realities and exogenous shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 prioritizes strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The \nprogram will not only facilitate continued reforms in this direction but will also contribute to \noperational priority 2 of Strategy 2030 (accelerating progress in gender equality).23 The program \nis included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2020\u20132022. The program is \nalso aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2021\u20132025 (currently under \npreparation), which emphasizes the government\u2019s objective of higher, inclusive, and sustained \ngrowth.   \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s value addition stems from its long experience in designing and implementing PBLs \nin its developing member countries, including Pakistan.24 These loans have covered several \nareas of economic management, including revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. \nADB has also supported reforms in state-owned enterprises and the energy sector in Pakistan. \n \n22 Government of India, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. 2019.

Manila. \n ", "10 \nADB\u2019s support for energy sector reforms also complements the reforms under subprogram 2. The \nprogrammatic approach, including subprogram 2, draws on lessons from these loans. Some of \nthe important prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program are strong government \ncommitment, adequate support from all stakeholders, public awareness campaigns to inform \nstakeholders, and strengthening of social safety nets for constituency building for reforms.25 ADB \nis well placed to carry out effective dialogue with the government on sensitive reforms. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  can  be  categorized  under  three  broad  groups:  (i)  facilitating \nidentification and sequencing of (a) key reforms, both with immediate impact (tariff and tax \nrationalization) and medium-term impact (institutional strengthening), and (b) international good \npractices  in  several  areas  of  economic  management;  (ii)  providing  operational  support  to \nimplement complex reforms (such as setting up of the EXIMBP, PSW, e-commerce portal, etc.) \nwith the help of the transaction TA; and (iii) coordinating with other development partners, \nespecially the IMF and the World Bank, to provide a unified reform package to the government. \nADB\u2019s stand-alone transaction TA for Preparing the Trade and Competitiveness Program totaling \n$750,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) was approved \non 5 September 2018 to support the effective preparation and implementation of the program, \nincluding technical support and capacity building; supplementary financing of $300,000 was \nprovided later.26 \n \n20.  Development partner and donor coordination. The ADB program team has been \nclosely coordinating with other development partners and donors in Pakistan as part of the Group \nof Five (G5),27 as well as through other forums and meetings, to identify key structural reform \nareas.  ADB  is  coordinating  its  efforts  to  improve  trade  and  competitiveness  with  other \ndevelopment partners based on a common set of reforms that are important to accelerate and \nsustain medium-term growth. The scope and coverage of subprogram 2 have been discussed \nwith the  G5  donors  and  development  partners. The  program complements  IMF-led  reform \ninitiatives by helping to improve competitiveness, which will help build robust foreign exchange \nreserves. Therefore, regular consultations with the IMF continue, especially in the context of EFF \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s support for the PSW draws from the initial plan prepared with support from \nthe United States Agency for International Development. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n21.  Pakistan\u2019s overarching development objective is to enhance economic benefits from trade. \nThus, improving export competitiveness will remain an important pillar. The effects of the reform \nwill be the following: competitiveness improved, and exports increased. The program will help \nachieve the government\u2019s development objectives through the proposed reforms, which will help \nstrengthen Pakistan\u2019s trade competitiveness. These reforms will primarily (i) help Pakistan\u2019s \nexport items to become more price competitive in international markets, and (ii) make Pakistan\u2019s \ntrade infrastructure and institutions conducive for higher exports and diversification of exportable \ngoods. \n \n \n25 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018.

", "11 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n22.  The proposed reforms under the program will have significant cost implications for the \ngovernment. Revenue losses from tax and tariff rationalization and operationalization of the PSW \nand EXIMBP will lead to additional fiscal stress. The amount of fiscal stress is estimated to be $2 \nbillion  over  a  3-year  period  (FY2019\u2013FY2021).  The  government  is  in  the  midst  of  a \ncomprehensive fiscal consolidation exercise encompassing the following: (i) reducing the debt-\nto-GDP ratio to set it on a firm downward trajectory, (ii) maintaining a sustainable fiscal deficit \nwhile  safeguarding  macroeconomic  stability,  and  (iii)  setting  the  stage  for  sustainable  and \ninclusive growth by enhancing expenditure on social and economic infrastructure. The COVID-19 \npandemic  and  the  government\u2019s  resulting  stimulus  package  further  burdened  the  public \nexchequer. The consolidated fiscal deficit (including grants)-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain \nhigh during FY2021. As a result, the government will face two challenges: \n(i)  It will need to create fiscal headroom, despite additional expenditure to mitigate \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to incur additional development finances \non targeted reforms proposed under the program. This is a clear illustration of a \nhard  budget  constraint  and  its  impact  on  development  financing,  given  the \ndownward  rigidity  in  nondiscretionary  items  of  recurrent  expenditure  (salary, \npensions, and interest). \n(ii)  Strong expenditure rationalization and revenue mobilization efforts will need to \ncontinue to create room for additional reform-related expenditure, to the extent it \nis reflected in the federal budget. The projected fiscal deficit in FY2021 and its \nfinancing are summarized in Table 4. ADB will provide about 5% of the projected \ndeficit, while about $4 billion will be mobilized from domestic sources to close \nfinancing of the fiscal deficit. \n \nTable 4: Development Financing Requirements \n($ million) \nFiscal Deficit and Major Development Partners  FY2021 \nProjected fiscal deficit  19,131 \nADB\u2019s budget support  900 \n1.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n24.  Debt sustainability. The debt sustainability analysis carried out in May 2020 for the \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program included the subprogram 2 loan \n ", "12 \namount.28   The debt-to-GDP ratio (excluding guarantees) is expected to decline from 87.2% in \nFY2020 to 73.4% by FY2024.29  The debt stock is estimated to be almost 91% of GDP (including \nguarantee) in FY2020. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The MOF will be the executing agency of the program. The MOF, Federal Board of \nRevenue, Ministry of Commerce, PNAC, and EXIMBP will be the implementing agencies. The \nproceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The programmatic approach will be implemented over 36 \nmonths (1 January 2018\u201331 December 2020). Implementation of subprogram 2 will cover the \nperiod from June 2019 to December 2020, and the P3F is expected to be implemented from \nJanuary to December 2021. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n26.  Several outputs of the program have technical components at their core. Setting up of the \nEXIMBP,  to  be  supported  under  the  program,  will  require  strong  financial  and  project \nmanagement and selection skills. Similarly, operationalizing the PSW will require sound technical \nknowledge. Capacity building support under the program will assist the relevant government \ndepartments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB.  Economic \n27.  The impacts of the program on the economy were analyzed, and  the results demonstrate \nimportant benefits attributable to the programmatic approach (combining two subprograms). The \nkey direct and indirect benefits considered are classified into four groups: \n(i)  Given  the  low  but  statistically  significant  price  elasticity  of  export  demand, \nPakistan\u2019s export competitiveness will be improved by rationalization of tariffs, \nregulatory duties, and commodity taxes.30 This will also facilitate higher growth by \ncreating demand for necessary domestically manufactured raw materials. \n(ii)  Higher foreign exchange reserves will allow domestic output to increase, permitting \na resulting increase in imports. \n(iii)  Several reforms related to trade facilitation, including improved access to finance, \nwill ease supply-side constraints, which will lead to trade diversification catering to \nthe group with higher income elasticity of demand.31 \n(iv)  Higher private investment because of a reduction in the corporate tax rate and tariff \nrationalization. In turn, improved private investment in Pakistan will lead to higher  \ngrowth, trade diversification, and more employment opportunities. \n \n28 ADB. 2020.

No. 160. Manila: ADB. ", "13 \nC.  Governance \n28.  A governance risk assessment was recently prepared by ADB staff.32 This assessment \nincluded a review of areas of possible risk and vulnerability in public financial management. The \ninternal audit functions of the government will require improvements. External audits, performed \nby the constitutionally independent office of the Auditor General of Pakistan, continue to face \ndelays in the execution of audits and the settlement of audit observations. The assessment found \nsome  risks  that  are  relevant  for  subprogram  2.  They  include  risks  related  to  institutional \ndimensions of the proposed reforms (e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions and lack of \ncoordination between different agencies). Moreover, key reforms may not be implemented in a \ntimely manner because of budget credibility and hard budget constraints of the government. While \nno major risks of mismanagement of resources at the implementing level have been discerned, \nissues identified in institutional capacity and financial sustainability, especially for the PSW and \nEXIMBP, were targeted for capacity development under the transaction TA (footnote 26) and \npolicy changes under the program. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n29.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. The support for \nimproved growth through higher exports will have significant impact on employment opportunities. \nThis issue has gained more prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a large number of \nvulnerable workers have lost their jobs, and the poverty ratio is expected to rise alarmingly.33 The \nprogram has proposed targeted gender-related actions. Improved access to finance for women \nentrepreneurs and facilitation of certification of jewelry will have a significant impact on women \nexporters. Research shows that women entrepreneurs lack access to basic banking services.34 \nMoreover, this problem is exacerbated when women entrepreneurs apply for trade finance for \nexports.  Businesses  owned  by  women  tend  to  be  smaller  and  less  formal,  women \ndisproportionately have lower access to collateral, and women are often overlooked as a viable \nbusiness segment by the financial service providers. Subprogram 2 will address this issue and \nfacilitate  further  amendment  to  one  of  the  existing  bank  finance  schemes  for  women \nentrepreneurs.35 The Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs has \nalready been amended to cover all the districts in Pakistan under subprogram 1. The new \namendment will increase loan size significantly to cover working capital as well as new investment \nrequirements.36  One  major  problem  is  that  the  scheme  is  not  known  to  many  women \nentrepreneurs. This is true in not only far-flung rural areas, but also urban centers. The transaction \nTA will help implement this scheme through public awareness campaigns through prominent \nEnglish newspaper.37 The program will also facilitate representation of female board members in \n \n32 ADB. 2020.
