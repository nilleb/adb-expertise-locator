The  Borrower  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  (i) \nexpand and improve its existing nationwide mobile telecommunication network, and (ii) enhance \nmobile  telecommunication  services  in  PNG.  The  Project  will  be  the  first  private  sector \ninvestment by Asian Development Bank (ADB) in PNG and its first private sector infrastructure \ninvestment in the Pacific region.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nSector Background  \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\nA. \n \n2. \nThe Project targets expansion of the Borrower\u2019s existing network and enhancement of its \naffordable telecommunication services across PNG, where the demand is growing rapidly. The \nassessment  indicates  that  the  Project  is  bankable  and  the  development  impact  is  substantial. \nADB\u2019s  role  in  the  Project  would  be  catalytic  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  crisis  response. \nTherefore,  the  Project  was  selected  for  processing  and  consideration  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nPNG,  with  a  population  of  about  6  million,  is  the  largest  economy  in  ADB\u2019s  Pacific \nregion.  Before  2007,  as  in  the  other  Pacific  island  countries,  the  telecommunication  market  in \nPNG  was  dominated  by  a  large  state-owned  enterprise,  Telikom  PNG.  With  fixed-line \npenetration  of  slightly  more  than  1%  and  mobile  penetration  of  less  than  5%  (prior  to  the \nBorrower\u2019s launch), the country was among those having insufficient telecommunication access \nin  the  world.  The  telecommunication  market  in  PNG  could  be  characterized  as  having  (i)  high \ndemand  for  affordable  services,  (ii)  widespread  consumer  dissatisfaction,  and  (iii)  high  tariffs \nand low telephony penetration. \n \nLack  of  reliable  fixed-line  infrastructure,  combined  with  cheaper  installation  costs  for \n4. \nmobile  telecommunication,  has  led  to  fixed-to-mobile  substitution.  Deregulation  of  the \ntelecommunication industry is likely to be imminent across the Pacific region, including PNG. In \n2002,  the  National  Executive  Council  (NEC)  of  PNG  announced  planned  liberalization  of  the \ntelecommunication sector from October 2007. In September 2006, the Borrower was confirmed \nto  be  licensed  for  mobile  telecommunication  operations  in  PNG  with  a  start  in  2007.  The \nBorrower  launched  its  service  in  July  2007.  Presently,  the  market  is  divided  by  the  Borrower, \nTelikom  PNG  (fixed  line  operator)  and  Bemobile  Ltd  (mobile  operator which  is  50%  owned  by \nTelikom PNG). \n \n5. \nDemand.  The  current  mobile  penetration  rate  in  PNG  is  approximately  18%,  which \nindicates the market is still underserved. 1 The global mobile penetration rate exceeded 60% at \nthe  beginning  of  2009,  albeit  with  a  certain  shrinkage  in  the  past  several  months  due  to  the \nglobal  economic  crisis.  The  mobile  penetration  rates  in  others  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member \ncountries are as follow: Afghanistan (35% in 2007), Azerbaijan (25% in 2005), Fiji Islands (34% \n\n                                                 \n1   Due  to  a  lack  of  up-to-date,  reliable  statistical  data,  it  is  difficult  to  estimate  accurately  the  demand  for  mobile \ntelecommunication  service  in  PNG  or  in  any  specific  province  or  city.  The  demand  analysis  focuses  on  the  low \nmobile penetration rate in PNG compared to other developing markets, which is indicative of strong unmet demand.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nin  2008),  Indonesia  (57%  in  2009),  Philippines  (76%  in  2008),  and  Samoa  (50%  in  2008). \nTherefore, the mobile telecommunication market in PNG is expected to grow. In addition to the \nexisting  market  that  has  not  been  served,  demand  growth  will  be  mainly  from  two  groups:  (i) \npotential customers who can afford and are willing to own mobile phones but are not covered by \nany mobile network, and (ii) potential customers who currently cannot afford mobile phones but \nare  already  within  mobile  coverage.  Further  demand  will  emerge  gradually  as  a  real  market \ntakes shape, coverage expands, and tariffs are reduced due to increasing competition.  \n \nReforms.  In  March  2009,  NEC  approved  a  comprehensive  set  of  reforms  for  the \n6. \ntelecommunications sector by endorsing the National ICT Policy Phase 2 Reforms Final Report \n(the NICT Report),2 developed by the Department of Communication & Information. The report \nsets out a path for staged introduction of open competition in PNG\u2019s telecommunications sector. \nIn summary, the following reforms were adopted by NEC: (i) introduction of a new technology-\nneutral  horizontal  licensing  regime,  (ii)  liberalization  of  the  international  telecommunications \ngateway,  (iii)  establishment  of  a  new  wholesale  access  and  interconnection  regime,  (iv) \ndevelopment  of  a  new  universal  access  scheme  to  provide  a  funding  mechanism  for \ntelecommunication projects in areas where commercial investment is not viable, and (v) creation \nof  a  new  information  and  communication  technology  regulator  to  be  known  as  the  National \nInformation and Communication Technology Authority.  \n \n7. \nwith the intention of giving legislative effect to the NICT Report. \n \n8. \nAs part of the proposed new licensing regime, current licensees (including the Borrower) \nwill be encouraged to migrate to the new set of licenses on a voluntary basis within a year of the \nNICT  Bill's  becoming  law.  The  bill,  when  enacted,  will  ensure  that  the  new  licenses  will  be \nissued on terms at least to the same extent permitted by the existing license.  \n \nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  telecommunications  sector  to  date  has  been  confined  to \n9. \nsupporting  the  competition  regulator,  the  ICCC,  in  developing  telecommunications  industry \ncodes  of  practice  and  interconnection  determinations.  Under  the  proposed  new  regulatory \nregime, ICCC\u2019s operating licensing functions and PANGTEL\u2019s technical licensing functions will \nbe transferred to the National Information and Communication Technology Authority, which will \nbe  established  as  the  one  independent  telecommunications  regulator.    PANGTEL  will  be \ndissolved but the ICCC will remain the general competition regulator. \n \n \nC. \n \n\n A  National  Information  and  Communications  Technology  Bill  (NICT  Bill)  was  drafted \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n10. \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020),  which  identifies  infrastructure  as  one  of  the  five  core  areas  where  ADB  will  employ  its \nfinancial  and  institutional  resources  in  order  to maximize  results,  efficiency,  and  impact.3  ADB \nwill  invest  in  infrastructure  to  improve  transport  and  communication  connectivity  within  and \nbetween  its  developing  member  countries.  Under  Strategy  2020,  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure \noperations will emphasize public-private partnerships and private sector engagement.  \n                                                 \n2  Government of PNG. 2009.

The  Project  will  directly  improve  the  poor\u2019s  access  to \nmarkets and basic productive assets, thereby helping to achieve inclusive growth in PNG.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy4 and its country strategy and program5 \n12. \n(CSP)  in  PNG.  One  key  result  area  as  identified  by  ADB  in  the  Pacific  Strategy  is  improved \nprovision,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  physical  infrastructure.  That  is  very  much  needed  in \norder  to  support  an  environment  conducive  to  the  private  sector.  In  the  new  Pacific  Strategy, \nwhich  is  close  to  completion,  information  and  communication  technology  is  one  of  the \noperational priorities. In the latest CSP midterm review, published in July 2009, ADB proposed \nfour refinements in the remaining CSP period, including an enhanced role for the private sector, \nand it planned to explore opportunities for ADB\u2019s private sector operations in PNG with a focus \non the infrastructure and energy sectors. 6 \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n\n13. \nThe  Project  complements  ADB\u2019s  continuous  effort  regarding  telecommunication  sector \nreforms  in  PNG.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  PNG\u2019s  telecommunication  sector  to  date  has  been \nconfined to support to ICCC.7 ADB was also involved in the public consultation of the proposed \nNICT  Bill.  As  a  lender  to  the  Project,  ADB  will  lend  its  support  to  the  effort  to  ensure  the \nrequirements of the NICT Report are fully expressed in the NICT Bill when it is enacted. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nThe Sponsor and Borrower \n\na. \n\nSponsor \n\n \n14. \nThe Sponsor, Digicel Pacific Limited, is an affiliate of Digicel Group Limited and Digicel \nHoldings (Central America) Limited, which together control the Digicel group\u2019s operations in the \nCaribbean and Central America. The Digicel brand was started in Jamaica in April 2001, and it \nhas rapidly gained market share in every country it has entered to date.  \n \n15. \nThe Sponsor is a holding company for its group\u2019s South Pacific operations, which cover \nfive  markets  including  Fiji  Islands,  PNG,  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Vanuatu.  In  2006,  Digicel  was \nlaunched  in  Samoa,  and  it  continues  to  enjoy  steady  growth  there.  The  Sponsor,  via  the \nBorrower,  launched  its  mobile  telecommunication  business  in  PNG  in  July  2007.  In  2008,  the \nSponsor launched business in Fiji Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.  \n \nThe  Digicel  brand  is  renowned  among  its  customers  for  competitive  rates,  wide \n16. \ncoverage, good customer care, a wide variety of products and services, up-to-date technology \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.

Key  factors  for  the  Borrower\u2019s  success  are  (i)  continuous  investment  in \nnetwork expansion and new technology, (ii) being first-to-market with new products and services, \n(iii)  a  retail  presence  and  strategy,  (iv)  24/7  customer  care,  (v)  an  experienced  management \nteam,  and  (vi)  community  activities.  These  together  constitute  the  successful  business  model \nand practices carried over from Digicel\u2019s experience in the Caribbean.  \n \nThe  Borrower\u2019s  management  team  has  significant  experience  in  the  telecom  industry \n18. \nand in Digicel\u2019s Caribbean business. Supported comes from the group\u2019s regional management \nteam as well as the broader resources and experience of its markets globally.   As  a \nresult, \nthe Borrower is expected to maintain its competitive advantages and to continue its success in \nPNG, even though telecom reform in PNG will make competition keener.  \n \n19. \nreliable  and  affordable  mobile \ntelecommunication services to a market. The increasing competition will benefit customers, and \nparticularly the poor. \n \n\nthe  benefits  of \n\nThe  Borrower \n\nis  bringing \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  Borrower\u2019s  existing  network  in  PNG  is  based  on  the  Global  System  for  Mobile-\n\n20. \ncommunications, the most popular standard for mobile telecom in the world. \n \n21. \nThe Project expands the Borrower\u2019s network capacity. The Borrower will add additional \nswitches, upgrade its billing system, and expand its network coverage. Most of the new network \nsites are in rural areas without basic telecom infrastructure. Although the equipment, the costs \nof  which  represent  about  60%  of  the  total  capital  expenditure,  was  purchased  from  foreign \nsuppliers,  the  civil  works  and  other  services  have  been  contracted  to  local  contractors  and \nsuppliers, which directly benefit the local economy. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  will  result  in  improved  and  expanded  mobile  telecommunication  network \n22. \nfacilities,  thus  enabling  more  subscribers  to  afford  and  use  telecommunication  services  in  line \nwith international standards. The outcome of the Project will be increased penetration of high-\nquality, affordable mobile telecommunication services in PNG.  \n \n23. \ntraining program for college graduates to develop core competence within the local staff.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Project will directly create more than 100 new jobs. The Borrower has introduced a \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n \nSince  its  launch,  the  Borrower  has  substantially  lowered  the  mobile  calling  prices  in \n24. \nPNG.  Through  implementing  the  Project,  tariffs  are  expected  to  continuously  decrease  as  the \nresult  of  enhanced  economies  of  scale  and  increased  competition.  Hence,  the  Project  will \n\n \n\n\f  5 \n\nincrease the affordability of telecom services, and particularly for low-income users across the \ncountry.  The  Project  will  moreover  expand  the  network  coverage  in  PNG,  and  the  improved \naccessibility will most benefit users in rural, remote areas, where there is limited telecom service \nat present. The increased affordability and improved accessibility will enable inclusive economic \ngrowth by facilitating access to markets and information, such as by providing remote access to \nbank accounts and updated market information for fishermen and farmers.  \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  significantly  improve  the  Borrower\u2019s  existing  network.  After  project \nimplementation, customers will enjoy better access to information, including in relation to public \nservices, education, health, and security. For an island developing country, such information as \nweather forecasts or natural disaster alerts is critical to the general public, particularly the poor. \nFollowing  completion  of  the  Project,  more  villages  which  have  roads  but  have  not  had \ntelephones,  will  be  able  to  use  ambulance  services  because  villagers  will  be  able  to  call  the \nservices  directly.  Also,  in  the  past  a  village  school  in  the  Highlands  region  could  close  for \nseveral days just because the teacher needed to go to a bank to confirm a wage credit (and this \ntook  so  long,  due  to  the  lack  of  transport  infrastructure).  With  the  short  messaging  system \nbanking service provided by the Borrower and its partner banks, commuting time will be saved.  \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u2013\n2010,8  which  focuses,  as  a  primary  goal,  on  improving  living  standards  in  the  country.  That \nstrategy strongly promotes fostering rural development and an enabling business environment. \nBy improving nationwide telecommunication infrastructure and expanding access in rural areas, \nthe Project will contribute to growth of the telecommunication sector in a country with growing \ndemand  from  the  entire  society  for reliable  and  affordable mobile  telecommunication  services. \nAs all other sectors in PNG will benefit from enhanced telecommunication services, the Project \nwill extend yet further the Borrower\u2019s contribution to economic growth and development in PNG. \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n \n27. \nThe Project will also provide direct training and development, employment, and business \nopportunities  to  staff,  dealers,  and  contractors  in  underdeveloped  areas  of  the  country.  The \nBorrower has been recognized as a leading example of good corporate governance and strong \nsocial  responsibility.  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  Borrower  will  promote  similar  good  practices  in  the \nprivate sector, the role of which is being enhanced in PNG. \n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nLicenses and Permits \n\nThe principal licenses and permits underpinning the Borrower\u2019s operations are (i) a 10-\n39. \nyear  license  to  operate  mobile  telecommunication  networks  in  PNG,  which  was  granted  in \nMarch  2007  by  the  ICCC,  the  commercial  regulator  and  licensing  authority;  and  (ii)  a  10-year \nspectrum usage agreement with PANGTEL, the technical regulator, granted in November 2008. \nThe license and agreement together give the Borrower a nonexclusive right to provide wireless \nvoice  and  data  telecommunication  services  based  on  the  Global  System  for  Mobile \ncommunications technology and standards in PNG. \n \n                                                 \n8 Government  of  PNG.  2004.  The  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132010:  \"Our  Plan  for  Economic  and \n\nSocial Advancement.\" Port Moresby. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAnother  important  permit  is  that  for  the  Borrower  to  operate  an  international  gateway \n40. \n(IGW).  The  ICCC  consented  to  the  Borrower\u2019s  operating  its  own  international  gateway  (thus \ngranting an IGW Permit) in July 2007.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInterconnection \n\n41. \nAnother  key  agreement  is  that  for  the  Borrower\u2019s  right  to  interconnect  its  facilities  to \nTelikom  PNG\u2019s  network.  The  Borrower  has  a  legal  right  to  interconnect  to  Telikom  PNG\u2019s \nnetwork under the Telecommunications Act 1996 on terms to be agreed by the parties.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\nThe Project expands the Borrower\u2019s existing network by increasing sites, most of which \n42. \nare in rural areas. All the contractors and equipment suppliers are reputable and were involved \nin the works at the existing sites.  \n\n \nSite construction, backbone expansion, and system upgrade will be done simultaneously. \n43. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  short  time  due  to  limited  civil  works  while  the \nequipment and system have been ordered in advance. The construction for each individual site \ncan be completed in about 2\u20133 weeks while many sites are constructed simultaneously. Due to \nthe nature of the construction works and the previous experience of contractors and suppliers, \nno system-wide delay is likely. \n\n \n4. \n\nOperations Arrangements \n\n44. \nThe  Borrower\u2019s  business  is  highly  automated.  Apart  from  its  headquarters  in  Port \nMoresby and regional key switches in other cities, all base stations or transmission towers in the \nbackbone  operate  unattended  and  are  fully  automated.  All  calls  and  data  services  are \nprocessed  by  computers.  The  major  labor-intensive  process  is  customer  service.  More  staffs \nare being recruited and trained in the customer service call center. \n \n45. \nThe  Borrower\u2019s  subscriber  base  is  dominated  by  prepaid  customers.  Prepaid  accounts \ncan  be  recharged  by  purchasing  top-up  cards  available  in  various  kinds  of  shops  or  buying \nloads for cash in Digicel retail stores, with a minimum load of just K1. A postpaid contract, which \nis  mainly  offered  to  large  corporations,  is  secured  by  a  significant  deposit.  Therefore,  the \nBorrower bears no payment risk from its subscribers.  \n \n46. \nHandsets  are  sold  from  as  low  as  K49,  with  a  SIM  card  and  limited  calling  minutes \nincluded.  Subsidies  are  offered  on  the  low-end  handsets  in  order  to  drive  subscriber  growth. \nThe phones are locked, and can only be used by Digicel\u2019s subscribers. With the launch of both \ninternet-enabled  mobile  phones  and  Blackberry  handsets,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the \ndemand for medium- and high-end handsets which do not require subsidy.  \n  \n47. \nSince many sites are in rural areas where no power grid is nearby, diesel generators are \nused for power supply in the existing network. Local maintenance contractors must go to those \nsites once every 6\u20138 weeks to refill diesel. This is the only significant maintenance needed for \nthe  sites.  Under  the  Project,  many  new  sites  will  install  solar  panels  as  the  primary  power \nsource  with  diesel  generators  as  backup.  These  new  sites  are  more  environmentally  friendly \nand require even less maintenance.  \n \n\n \n\n\f  7 \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n48. \nThe  Borrower  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand policy relating to the Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  the  Borrower  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and the Borrower will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\n49. \nThe Borrower will continue to provide to the lenders, including ADB, quarterly unaudited \nfinancial  statements,  quarterly  operations  reports,  annual  audited  financial  statements,  annual \noperations  reports,  annual  environmental  and  social  monitoring  reports,  and  annual  business \nplans. It must report any important changes. ADB will monitor the Project vis-\u00e0-vis the business \nplans, using information from its own sources and the public domain. Evaluation of the Project \nwill be on three levels: (i) the success of the Project, (ii) economic growth in PNG generally, and \n(iii) private sector development in PNG. . \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n50. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  for  the  Project  will  comprise  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $25 \nmillion.  The  loan  will  be  funded  using  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without  government \nguarantee.   \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\n51. \nADB\u2019s  potential  assistance  for  the  Project  will  be  justified  based  on  its  value-added, \ndevelopment  impacts  and  demonstration  effects.  It  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development \nplans and ADB\u2019s operational strategies. In the Project, ADB will add value by: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCatalyzing  further  commercial  financing  to  a  thriving  sector  in  PNG.  The  local \ndebt market is limited at present, particularly for medium-term financing. Offshore \ncommercial  and  export  credit  sources  are  also  limited  in  extending  uncovered \nfinancing to businesses in PNG. The global financial crisis has further tightened \nPNG\u2019s access to liquidity. ADB\u2019s role in the Project is therefore considered to be \ncritical  in  catalyzing  medium-term  commercial  debt  financing  and  mitigating  the \neffects of the current global financial crisis.  \nDemonstrating  support  for  a  sustainable  private  sector  participation  with  good \ncorporate  governance  and  strong  social  responsibility  in  PNG  and  the  Pacific \nregion  (of  which  there  are  not  many),  encouraging  entrepreneurs  and  financial \ninvestors to consider investments in key sectors in PNG and the Pacific region, \nand inducing competitors to improve their service and performance. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(iii) \n\nReflecting the strong commitment  of ADB\u2019s private sector operations to support \nsmall-scale economies within its developing member countries. In particular, the \nProject  helps  to  encourage  the  transfer  of  capital,  technology,  and  experience \nfrom an experienced international sponsor to a developing member country.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 9   the \n52. \nGovernment has been requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto  the  Borrower.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will \nenter  into  finance  documents  acceptable  to  ADB  following  the  approval  of  the  proposed \nfinancing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n53. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$25,000,000  to  Digicel  (PNG)  Limited  for  the  Digicel  Mobile  Telecommunication  Expansion \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n26 October 2009 \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n \n9  ADB. 1966.
