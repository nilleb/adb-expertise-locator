To  ensure  a  sustainable  supply  of  energy,  the  Government  of \nPakistan  has  launched  a  number  of  initiatives  for  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  the \ncountry\u2019s  infrastructure,  with  a  major  focus  on  the  energy  sector.  As  part  of  these  efforts,  a \nnumber  of  energy  policies  were  introduced  and have  resulted  in  significant  (albeit  insufficient) \ninvestment  from  the  private  sector.  As  of  FY2013,  11,681  megawatts  (MW)  or  49.4%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  installed  power  capacity  was  owned  and  operated  by  private  sector  investors.2 The \nproject is one of the earlier hydropower projects identified under the Power Policy (2002) by the \nPrivate  Power  and  Infrastructure  Board (PPIB)\u2014the  national  institution  entrusted  with bringing \nprivate  investment  into  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector.  The  project\u2019s  detailed  feasibility  study  was \napproved by the PPIB in April 2006. \n \nKOSEP approached ADB in early 2012 for financing given (i) ADB\u2019s record in supporting \n3. \nthe  country\u2019s  first  two  hydro  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  in  Pakistan\u2014New  Bong \nEscape Hydropower and Patrind Hydropower,3 (ii) the relatively large project debt requirement, \nand  (iii) local  banks\u2019  current  reluctance  to  provide  long-term  limited  recourse  project  finance \n(caused by asset\u2013liability mismatch concerns). \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  involves  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  102  MW  run-of-river \n4. \nhydroelectric  power  generation  facility  on  the  Poonch  River,  28  kilometers  upstream  of  the \nMangla  reservoir,  country\u2019s  second  largest  storage  reservoir.  The  project  will  be  developed \nunder  the  Power  Policy  (2002)  and  will  be  undertaken  on  a  build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer  basis \nfor  30 years  from  the  commercial  operations  date.  Keeping  in  view  the  hydrology  data  (and \nvariation therein) for Poonch River, the average annual energy generation will be 465 Gwh, and \nelectricity  will  be  evacuated  through  the  existing  Kotli\u2013Dhudial  132-kilovolt  single-circuit \ntransmission line passing over the project site. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n5. \nMPL, the borrower, is a special purpose vehicle that has the right to develop the project. \nMPL is owned by KOSEP (76%), Daelim (18%), and Lotte (6%). MPL\u2019s chief executive officer is \ndeputed from KOSEP and is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of MPL under the supervision \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2014.

The chief executive officer is supported \nby professionals in project development, engineering, finance, and regulatory affairs. \n \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\nThe successful development of the project will contribute to (i) improved power supply in \n6. \nPakistan,  (ii)  a diversified power generation mix,  and (iii)  increased  investments  by  the  private \nsector in renewable energy projects in Pakistan. The project will help alleviate Pakistan\u2019s severe \npower  shortage,  which  hampers  the  country\u2019s  economic growth  and  efforts  to  reduce  poverty. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  project  will  also  foster  confidence  among  potential  investors \nand lenders, and promote further private sector investment in renewable energy and power. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome  \n\n7. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  increased  supply  of  cleaner  hydropower  from \nindigenous  energy  sources.  The  project  will  generate  an  additional  465  gigawatt-hours  of \nelectricity annually by using indigenous water resources, and the tariff for electricity supplied by \nthe project will be lower than that for plants that use imported fuel and other renewable energy \nsources such as wind and solar energy. The project will also avoid greenhouse gas emissions \nof about 253,797 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.  \n \n\n3. \n\n Outputs \n\nThe outputs of the project will be the net additional installed power generation capacity \n\n8. \nof 102 MW, which is equivalent to about 1.8% of the power shortfall in the country.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  with  its  focus  on \n9. \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, private sector development and \noperations,  environment  and  climate  change,  and  infrastructure  development.4 ADB\u2019s  support \nfor  the  project  is  in  line  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  2009\u20132013,  which \ninfrastructure \nemphasizes  energy  sector  development,  private  sector  participation \ndevelopment,  and  expansion  of  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  energy  sector.5 The \nproject  is  a  logical  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s  development  and  reform  efforts  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy \nsector, which have been designed to promote a well-regulated, market-oriented power industry, \nparticularly  when  the  country  faces  challenges  in  attracting  commercial  financing.  Energy \ninfrastructure has featured prominently in ADB\u2019s private sector operations in Pakistan. \n \n\nin \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\n10. \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014\nmaximizing  access  to  energy  for  all. 6  The  project  will  add  power  generation  capacity  and \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014.

Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nincrease the  reliability  of  electricity  supplies  in  a  country  facing  a severe  power  shortage.  The \nelectricity  tariff for the  project  will  be  significantly  lower  than  the  average  price  of  power  in  the \ncountry, and will not be affected by the volatility of the international fuel market, which impacts \nmuch of the existing thermal power generation capacity in the country. The project will promote \nthe  use  of  indigenous  and  renewable  resources,  and  will  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s  energy \nsecurity. The project will help ADB meet its commitment to undertake clean energy investments \nof at least $2 billion per year. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n11. \nADB  has  taken  the  lead  in  supporting  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  to  attract  private \ncapital  into  the  energy  (especially  renewable  energy)  sector;  and  has  been  instrumental  in \npioneering  many  transactions,  keeping  in  view  local  banks\u2019  long-term  lending  constraints  and \ntheir  reluctance  to  finance  renewable  energy  initiatives.  ADB  financed  the  first  two  private \nhydropower  projects  in  Pakistan:  the  84  MW  New  Bong  Escape  and  the  147  MW  Patrind \nhydropower  projects  (footnote  3).  ADB  also  financed  Pakistan\u2019s  first  three  private  wind  power \nprojects: Zorlu Enerji (56 MW) and Foundation Wind Energy I (50 MW) and II (50 MW). 7 ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  in these  projects  not  only  provided  much-needed  long-term  debt  (which  is  crucial \nfor infrastructure development), but also acted as a catalyst to raise foreign and local financing. \nThe project also fully compliments ADB sovereign operation\u2019s support for energy sector reforms \nthat target fuel mix diversification in the power sector through renewable energy resources.8 \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $367.4 million, including contingencies.

International  commercial  banks  are  not \nactive  in  Pakistan  (infact  most  have  left  the  market  altogether;  others  are  scaling  down  their \npresence) and local banks have severe lending constraints. ADB has a strong presence through \nits  public  and  private  sector  operations  in  the  country;  International  Monetary  Fund  regularly \nconsults with ADB on country\u2019s energy related reforms. As the project involves multiple layers of \ngovernment  entities,  ADB\u2019s  presence  helps  reassure  the  international  sponsors  that  the \ngovernment  entities  will  continue  to  support  the  project  in  the  long  term.  Lastly,  ADB  has \ninvested considerable resources in the project to ensure compliance with high environment and \nsocial safeguard standards and to mitigate climate-related risks, which are described in detail in \nparas 16-20.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions   \n\n15. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory A for environment and involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified; and effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nMPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental risks are deemed adequate. \n \nEnvironment. The current dam site was selected to minimize environmental and social \n16. \nadverse impacts on the area. A 66-meter high concrete gravity dam will be constructed to divert \nwater  from  700  meters  of  the  river  section,  which  will  create  a  292-hectare  reservoir.  The \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nconstruction will take 55 months to complete and will excavate 1 million cubic meters of soil and \nrock to meet the requirement of rock-fill at cofferdams and stone pitching. However, the bulk of \nthe  excavated material will  be  deposited  in  the spoil  tip area  at  the  project site. The  project  is \nlocated  in  a  critical  habitat  of  two  endangered  fish  species  of  conservation  importance  in  the \naffected rivers: Mahseer Tor putitora and Glyptothorax kashmirensis Catfish. Both species are \nlisted  as  endangered  and  critically  endangered  in  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of \nNature  Red  List.  The  local  fisheries  and  wildlife  department  will  formalize  its  commitment  to \nestablish the national park management plan (NPMP) by signing a cooperation agreement with \nMPL  to  provide  technical  and  financial  support.  The  plan  includes  zoning  for  river  sections \nthrough  consultations  with  local  communities  and  stakeholders  to  provide  solutions  that \ncombine environmental protection and economic development to ensure the sustainability of the \ncritical habitat. It is highly likely that the NPMP would not be developed without MPL\u2019s support \nbecause of the financial constraints of local authorities. \n \n17.  One of the key components of the NPMP is the biodiversity action plan (BAP), which has \nbeen developed to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements for projects in critical habitat. The BAP \nwill ensure that Mahseer species living in upstream of the dam are able to migrate to breed at \nspawning grounds in upstream tributaries. Commercial hatcheries will seed fish downstream of \nthe dam, as migration will not be possible from downstream. The Catfish will continue to spawn \nacross  the  river.  Therefore,  there  will  not  be  measurable  adverse  impacts  on  the  river\u2019s  high \nbiodiversity value if present aquatic environmental conditions are preserved outside the project \nfootprint.  The  BAP  will  avoid  further  reduction  in  population  of  these  two  species  and  will \naddress  any  residual  adverse  environmental  impact  associated  with  the  project.  Moreover, \nNPMP  will  regulate  future  infrastructure  development  activities  in  the  Poonch  River  through \nzoning  to  ensure  environmental  sustainability  of  the  critical  habitat.  Climate  change  risk \nassessment  recommends  continuous  river  flow  measurement  to  ensure  safe  dam  operations, \nas well as periodical monitoring of precipitation within the catchment area. \n \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  will  affect  277  households,  of  which  166  households \n18. \n(including  four  households  requiring  physical  relocation)  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive assets and the remaining 111 households will lose less than 10% of their assets. A \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  to  address  these  impacts.  Key \nmeasures include payment of cash compensation based on negotiated rates (which are higher \nthan  the  prevailing  market  value)  plus  a  15%  compulsory  acquisition  surcharge,  and \nimplementation  of  livelihood  programs  in  consultation  with  affected  people.  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements.  People  affected  by  land  acquisition  have  also  been  notified  in  accordance  with \nthe  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1897,  and  Land  Acquisition  Rules  (1994).  Key  information  from  the \nLARP such as eligibility, entitlements, and the schedule of LARP implementation was disclosed \nduring  consultations \nin  April  2014.  External  monitoring  arrangements  and  grievance \nmechanisms  are  in place.  No official  census has  been  carried  out to ascertain  the  ethnicity of \npeople in Kotli district but estimates suggest that major tribes in the project area are Awan, Syed, \nGujar, Jat, Rajput, and Sudhan. These tribes do not meet the criteria set in the Safeguard Policy \nStatement  to  be  considered  as  indigenous  peoples  and  no  impact  on  them  by  the  project  is \nexpected. \n \nOther social dimensions. MPL will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy10 and \n19. \nreport  regularly  to  ADB  on  its  compliance  (including  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and \nadherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.   MPL will implement the gender \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2003. Social Protection.
