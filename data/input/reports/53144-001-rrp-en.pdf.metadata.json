The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  for  Rural  Enterprise  Financing,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \nThe project will increase incomes of subsistence small farmers by helping them engage \n2. \nin rural enterprises. The project will finance rural enterprises comprising (i) collective enterprises \nthat are jointly owned and operated by small farmers, and (ii) individual enterprises. The project \nwill also improve the financial intermediary\u2019s rural enterprise financing capacity as well as provide \nvalue chain development and business facilitation support for small farmers, especially women. \nThe project comprises (i) a loan of $50 million from the concessional ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and (ii) a TA grant of $750,000 to be financed from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6)  for  $500,000  and  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Special Fund for $250,000.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRural poverty in Nepal. Nepal has made notable socioeconomic progress as indicated \nin the decline of the population living below poverty line from 41.8% in 1995 to 25.2% in 2011.2 \nHowever,  as  of  2018,  28.6%  of  the  total  population  is  still  multidimensionally  poor.3  Nepal\u2019s \npoverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, with 7% of the urban population and 33% of the \nrural  population being multidimensionally  poor.  Nepal\u2019s  rural  poverty  is  closely  associated  with \nlimited gainful  employment  opportunities  in rural  areas  where the  agriculture  sector  dominates \nemployment. The agriculture sector contributes  27.0% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product \nbut employs 70.1% of the total population.4 However, the sector is largely subsistence in nature \nand  confined  to  primary  production  of  crops  and  livestock  with  little  value  addition  and \ncommercialization.5  The  earnings  from  subsistence  agriculture  activities are  hardly  enough  for \nrural households to move out of poverty.6 \n \n4. \nTo  reduce  rural  poverty,  it  is  necessary  to  shift  from  current  subsistence  production  to \nvalue-adding rural enterprises. A value chain in agriculture is a set of activities that adds value to \ncommodities  and  links  primary  producers  to  processers,  traders,  merchants  with  storage, \n\n                                                \n1  Established by ADB.

Rural enterprises are micro, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in rural areas and include on-farm and off-farm enterprises. \nOn-farm  enterprises  produce  crops  and  livestock  for  commercial  sale.  Off-farm  enterprises \nencompass  all  types  of  economic  activities  excluding  subsistence  production  and  on-farm \nenterprises.  In  general,  rural  enterprises  can  generate  at  least  30%  more  income  than \nsubsistence production.7 However, rural enterprise development in Nepal is hampered because \nof  insufficient  business  facilitation  and  limited  rural  enterprise  financing.  Developing  rural \nenterprises  in Nepal  requires various support,  including  business facilitation,  capacity  building, \nand financing. \n \n5. \nRural  enterprise  financing  in  Nepal.  In  Nepal,  formal  financial  institutions  are \ncategorized into commercial banks (class A), development banks (class B), finance companies \n(class C), and microfinance institutions (MFIs) (class D). Class D MFIs include (i) microfinance \ndevelopment banks; (ii) microfinance nongovernment organizations; and (iii) savings and credit \ncooperatives, which are licensed and supervised by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank. \nIn  addition  to  those  financial  institutions,  there  are  semiformal  microfinance  nongovernment \norganizations  and savings  and credit  cooperatives that  provide  financial  services without  NRB \nlicenses. \n \n6. \nAmong  the  formal  financial  institutions,  commercial  banks  dominate  the  sector.  As  of \nMarch  2019,  commercial  banks\u2019  share  of  the  total  financial  sector  loan  portfolio  was  80.47%, \ndevelopment banks\u2019 share was 10.56%, finance companies\u2019 share was 2.15%, and MFIs\u2019 share \nwas  6.82%.8  Finance  companies\u2019  rural  outreach  is  insignificant.  Commercial  banks  and \ndevelopment  banks  have  rural  branches;  however,  despite  the  government\u2019s  various  policy \nmeasures to increase rural lending, their loan portfolios are mainly concentrated in urban areas \nand the corporate sector.9 Further, banks\u2019 loans to MSMEs are estimated at about 25% of their \ntotal loan portfolio.10 \n \nBanks  have  limited  appetite  to  finance  rural  enterprises  because  of  the  high  cost \n7. \nassociated  with  making  small  loans  in rural  areas.  In  addition,  banks\u2019  rural  financing  is  limited \nbecause of (i)  banks\u2019  limited  rural  outreach, (ii)  banks\u2019  limited knowledge  and risk  assessment \ncapacity  in  rural  enterprise financing,  and (iii)  rural  enterprises\u2019  difficulty  in  securing  valid  loan \ncollateral. \n \n8. \nIn Nepal, formal and semiformal MFIs serve over 5 million poor and low-income clients in \nrural areas. MFIs mainly provide short-term microcredit for subsistence agriculture activities and \ncottage-sized  income-generating  activities.  MFIs  can  provide  loans  up  to  NRs700,000  without \ncollateral but based on group guarantee, and above NRs700,000 to NRs1 million with collateral. \nMFIs are unable to scale up their operations to finance rural enterprise because of (i) a regulatory \nceiling on MFIs\u2019 loans of NRs1 million, (ii) MFIs\u2019 limited sources of funding, and (iii) MFIs\u2019 limited \n                                                \n7  ADB.

The productive sector lending scheme requires banks to allocate at least 10% of the total portfolio to the \nagriculture sector. The deprived sector lending scheme requires banks to lend at least 5% of the total portfolio to \npoor, low-income, and marginalized populations. \n\n10 Beed Management Pvt. Ltd. 2018.

Commercial banks\u2019 limited lending to rural \nMSMEs and MFIs\u2019 inability to scale up their operations create a vacuum of access to finance for \nrural enterprises. \n \nSmall  Farmers  Development  Bank.  Small  Farmers  Development  Bank  (SFDB)  was \n9. \nestablished in July 2001 and licensed by NRB as a class D MFI.11 It is an apex microfinance bank \nthat  promotes  access  to  finance  to  small  farmers.  SFDB  provides  wholesale  loans  to  small \nfarmers agriculture cooperatives (SFACs) and technical and training support for SFAC members\u2019 \nincome-generating activities. \n \nAs of March 2019, SFDB had 680 affiliated member SFACs in 68 districts.12 SFDB offers \n10. \nwholesale loans to SFACs for (i) general microcredit, (ii) livestock credit, (iii) renewable energy \ncredit,  and  (iv)  livelihood  restoration  microcredit  for  households  that  were  affected  by  the \nearthquake in 2015. Of SFDB\u2019s total loan portfolio, 95.79% are general microcredit and livestock \nloans. However, because of the growing demand for enterprise loans from SFACs, in 2016, SFDB \nstarted a pilot loan to a tea processing factory jointly owned by SFAC-member small farmers in \nJhapa District in eastern Nepal. In 2019, there are five such collective enterprises in operation.13 \n \n11. \nIn fiscal year (FY) 2018, SFDB\u2019s total loans outstanding with SFACs amounted to NRs17 \nbillion,  up  from  NRs8  billion  in  FY2015.  The  on-time  recovery  rate  is  99.95%.  SFDB\u2019s  capital \nadequacy ratio is 10.38%, which is above the statutory required capital of 8.00% for class D MFIs. \nSFDB\u2019s  return  on  equity  of  21.97%  and  return  on  assets  of  3.21%  are  adequate.  SFDB\u2019s  net \nincome increased to NRs393 million in FY2018 from NRs154 million in FY2015. SFDB does not \ncollect  public  deposits  but  relies  mostly  on  short-term  loans from  the  government,  banks,  and \nother financial institutions. Heavy reliance on short-term borrowing puts pressure on SFDB\u2019s cost \nof  fund.  Its  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  5.73%  in  FY2018  as  compared  to  2.99%  in \nFY2015,  which  made  its  interest rate  structure  unpredictable and  volatile.  Access  to  long-term \nfunding will allow SFDB to strengthen its liquidity and reduce its cost of fund volatility. \n \n12. \nSmall  farmers  agriculture  cooperatives.  SFACs  are  member-owned  and  member-\nmanaged community-based organizations that provide savings and credit services to members. \nSFACs are registered cooperatives with the Department of Cooperatives under the Cooperative \nAct of 1992. There are 670,866 SFAC members, of which 75% are women in 2018. The SFAC \nmembers are small and marginal farmers with landholding of less than 0.75 hectares.14 In 2018, \nthe  total  number  of  SFAC  member  borrowers  was  326,767,  of  which  75.23%  (245,825)  were \nwomen. The average loan size for all borrowers was NRs140,485, while that for women borrowers \nwas NRs95,300. In FY2018, SFACs\u2019 total loans outstanding to members stood at NRs435 billion, \nup from NRs207 billion in FY2015. SFACs\u2019 aggregate recovery rate was 97.63%. SFACs show \nstrong credit demand, as their members are increasingly seeking loans for their MSME ventures. \n\n                                                \n11 Sana Kisan Bikas Laghubitta Bittiyasanstha Ltd or commonly called SFDB. \n12 SFAC eligibility criteria to be affiliated with SFDB include the following: (i) registered as a cooperative; (ii) at least 2 \nyears of experience in providing savings and credit services after registration; (iii) potentiality to increase outreach \nand business; (iv) have developed a 3-year business plan; (v) proper record keeping in a double-entry bookkeeping \nsystem;  (vi)  regularity  in  general  assembly  and  board  meetings;  and  (vii)  no  delinquent  loans  with  the  board  of \ndirectors, staff and their family members in the cooperative, and other financial institutions. \n\n13 The existing SFAC collective enterprises are a milk collection center and two rice mills in Rupandehi District, and a \n\ntea processing factory and a seed processing factory in Jhapa District. \n\n14 SFAC member criteria include the following: (i) a family with land area up to 0.76 hectares in the hills and up to 0.67 \nhectares in the Terai (a lowland area in southern Nepal); (ii) an individual or household with livelihood difficulties and \nno regular income; and (iii) an individual or household with no overdue loans with banks, financial institutions, or the \ngovernment. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fAlthough SFACs are actively seeking other funding sources, their funding source is limited mainly \nto loans from SFDB and SFACs\u2019 member deposits. \n \n13. \nProposed solution. The project will promote rural enterprises to generate employment \nand  improve  incomes  of  subsistence  small  farmers.  Under  the  project,  rural  enterprises  are \ncategorized as (i) collective enterprises that engage in the production, processing, and marketing \nof  agriculture  produce  and  are  jointly  owned  by  SFACs  and  their  members;  and  (ii)  individual \nenterprises  that  are  owned  and  operated  by  individual  SFAC  members.  SFDB  is  an  anchor \nfacilitator  and  investor  for  rural  enterprises  and  uses  its  SFAC  networks  across  Nepal  for \nenterprise  facilitation  and  financial  intermediation.  The  project  has  an  innovative  feature  of \ntransforming subsistence small farmers into micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurs with \nthe  combined  support  of  value  chain  development,  business  facilitation,  and  financing.  The \nfinancial intermediary modality was chosen because it is the most effective channel to facilitate \nrural  enterprise  development.  By  adopting  the  financial  intermediary  modality,  the  project  can \nexercise  prudent  client  selection  and  due  diligence  to  ensure  the  project\u2019s  rural  enterprise \ninvestments  are  sustainable  and  yield  effective  social  and  economic  returns  for  eligible  small \nfarmers. \n \n14.   Government  policy.  The  government\u2019s  14th  Three-Year  Development  Plan,  FY2017\u2013\nFY2019 has the goals of (i) improving the living standards of the Nepalese people through various \npolicies  of  high  economic  growth,  (ii)  reducing  the  poverty  rate  by  21%  through  employment \ngeneration,  (iii)  reducing  economic  inequalities,  and  (iv)  generating  dignified  and  gainful \nemployment opportunities.15 Further, the government\u2019s Agriculture Development Strategy, 2015\u2013\n2035 promotes the agriculture sector\u2019s profitable commercialization to transform the sector from \nsubsistence farming to agribusiness enterprises.16 \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s sector experience. The project is based on ADB\u2019s successful rural finance project \nexperiences  in  Nepal.  ADB  financed  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Cluster  Program \n(RFSDCP) (subprograms 1 and 2) and the Disaster Risk Reduction and Livelihood Restoration \nProject (DRRLRP).17 The RFSDCP reformed key rural finance institutions, including SFDB. The \nRFSDCP\u2019s project completion reports rated both subprogram 1 and 2 successful and recognized \nthe  project\u2019s  impact  on  expanded  rural  finance  outreach,  while  recommending  close  impact \nmonitoring on women\u2019s access to finance.18 The DRRLRP was an emergency assistance grant \nresponding to the earthquake in Nepal in 2015; it has provided livelihood restoration microcredit \nto  over  15,700  affected  households.  Under  the  RFSDCP  and  DRRLRP,  SFDB  was  the \nimplementing agency, and it has successfully implemented the institutional reform and financial \nintermediary components. \n \n\n                                                \n15 Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2017. 14th Three-Year Development Plan, FY2017\u2013FY2019. \n\n16 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Agricultural Development. 2015.

The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Review of \n2011  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan,  which  recommended  retaining  a  focus  on  inclusive \nfinance to deliver affordable financial services to small businesses.20 \n\n \nProject Description \n\nB. \n \n17. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: employment-oriented economic activities \nincreased (footnote 15). The project will have the following outcome: small farmers\u2019 engagement \nin rural enterprises increased.21 \n \n18. \nOutput 1: Collective enterprises developed and financed. The project will develop and \nfinance at least 50 collective enterprises with value chain development and business facilitation \nsupport.  Typical  collective  enterprises  include  commercial  farming,  milk  collection  centers, \nmustard  oil  mills,  rice mills,  seed  processing  factories,  and  tea  processing  factories.  For  each \ncollective enterprise, a group of SFAC members will be the owner and shareholders, of which at \nleast  40%  are  women.  SFDB  will  make  a  wholesale  loan  to  SFACs  to  finance  collective \nenterprises.  The  maximum  loan  size  to  a  collective  enterprise  will  be  NRs20  million.22  The \nrepayment  obligation  of  an  SFAC\u2019s  loan  for  a  collective  enterprise  will  be  shared  among  the \nshareholders proportional to each member\u2019s shareholding. SFDB will finance only those collective \nenterprises with strong financial viability and marketing potential, and which meet the eligibility \ncriteria. \n \n19. \nOutput 2: Individual enterprises promoted and financed. The project will also support \nSFAC members who are willing to start or expand their individual enterprises. Typical individual \nenterprises  include  commercial  farming  and  livestock  production,  and  agriculture  produce \ncollection, processing and marketing. The project will finance about 500 individual entrepreneurs, \nincluding start-ups; at least 30% of the entrepreneurs will be women. The maximum loan size to \nan  individual  enterprise  will  be  NRs5  million  (footnote  22).  SFDB  will  provide  value  chain \ndevelopment and business facilitation support for individual enterprises, especially for women. \n \n20. \nOutput  3:  Rural  enterprise  financing  capacity  enhanced.  The  project  will  support \nSFDB\u2019s and SFACs\u2019 enterprise financing skills, especially in business appraisal, due diligence, \nrisk  assessment,  financial  management,  and  safeguards.  Specifically,  the  project  will  support \nSFDB to develop the collective and individual enterprises by financing operational policies and \nguidelines as well as assisting in business identification, appraisal and monitoring of the collective, \nand  individual  enterprise  loan  portfolio.  The  project  will  also  support  establishing  a  detailed \nmanagement  information  system  to  capture  the  information  on  rural  enterprise  business \nperformance, and gender-disaggregated impacts on employment generation and incomes. \n \n\n                                                \n19 ADB.  2018.

Currently, three development partners implement inclusive finance \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  finance  projects  in  Nepal  focusing  on  capacity \ndevelopment for  commercial  banks.23 The  project\u2019s financial  intermediation to  rural  enterprises \nwill complement other development partners\u2019 interventions. Further, the project has an innovative \napproach  by  promoting  collective  rural  enterprises.  Unlike  regular  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprise projects in which the loans are provided to sole proprietorship enterprises, the project \nwill organize subsistence small farmers into enterprise shareholders and transform them into rural \nentrepreneurs. The project\u2019s focus on capacity building of SFDB and its partner SFACs will have \na lasting impact on financial inclusion for rural MSMEs by scaling up MFIs\u2019 enterprise financing \noperations.  The  project  will  have  a  strong  synergy  with  the  Food  Safety  and  Agriculture \nCommercialization Program for Nepal by extending the business facilitation and financing support \nto agribusinesses to be developed under the program.24 \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe project is estimated to cost $50 million (Table 1). The sub-borrowers are expected to \ncontribute  at  least  18%  of  the  total  rural  enterprise  subproject  investments  from  their  own \nsources.25 The summary financing plan is in Table 2.  \n  \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nCredit linea \nTotal \n\ninvestments from their own sources. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\na  The sub-borrowers are expected to contribute to at least 18% of the total rural enterprise subproject \n\nAmount \n50 \n50 \n\n  \nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n\nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)a \nTotal \n\n50 \n50 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n\n100 \n100 \n\na  The sub-borrowers are expected to contribute at least 18% of the total rural enterprise subproject \n\ninvestments from their own sources. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n                                                \n23 These are (i) the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom\u2019s Sakchyam Access to Finance \nfor the Poor Programme, (ii) German development cooperation through KfW\u2019s Sustainable Economic Development \nProgram, and (iii) the International Fund for Agricultural Development\u2019s Samriddhi Rural Enterprises and Remittances \nProject. \n\n24 ADB.

As such, it is difficult to accurately quantify the sub-borrower \ncontributions  in  monetary  terms.  Accordingly,  the  sub-borrower  contributions  are  not  expressed  in  United  States \ndollars.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe government has requested a concessional loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n23. \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe final relending, onlending, and sub-lending terms and conditions are determined during the \nsubsidiary loan agreement negotiation between the government and SFDB. \n \n24. \nADB will disburse the loan proceeds following its Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the  government  and \nADB. The advance fund procedure will be used based on the estimate of the eligible expenditures \nfor  the  forthcoming  6  months.  SFDB  and  the  SFACs  funded  under  the  project  will  submit  an \nannual audited statement of utilization of funds. \n \n25. \nRelending. The government will relend the ADB loan proceeds to SFDB in local currency. \nThe  provisional  relending  interest  rate  and  terms  are  5%  per  year  with  up  to  a  32-year  term, \nincluding  a grace  period  of  up  to  8  years,  and  other  conditions  to  be  defined in the  subsidiary \nagreement between the government and SFDB. The government will bear the foreign exchange \nrisks. \n \n26. \nOnlending.  SFDB  will  onlend  to  eligible  SFACs  for  financing  rural  enterprises.  The \nprovisional onlending interest rate and terms are 7% per year with up to a 8-year term including \na grace period of up to 2 years for the fixed capital loans and no grace period for the working \ncapital loans, and other conditions to be defined in the financing agreement between SFDB and \nSFACs. \n \n27. \nSub-lending. SFACs will sub-lend to eligible members for their collective and individual \nenterprise investments. The provisional sub-lending interest rates and terms are as follows: (i) for \ncollective enterprises, 10% per year with up to a 7-year term, including a grace period of up to 2 \nyears for the fixed capital loans and no grace period for the working capital loans; (ii) for individual \nenterprises, 10% per year with up to a 5-year term, including a grace period of up to 1 year for \nthe fixed capital loans and no grace period for the working capital loans, and other conditions to \nbe defined in the loan agreement between SFAC and sub-borrowers. \n \n28. \nRevolving fund (at Small Farmers Development Bank). The loans repaid by SFACs \nwill be maintained at the rural enterprise fund account established at SFDB. SFDB will onlend to \nSFACs with the project\u2019s same onlending terms and conditions for rural enterprises financing by \nSFDB. The same SFAC and sub-borrower eligibility criteria for rural enterprise financing will be \napplied. SFDB will maintain a separate account for the revolving fund. \n \n29. \nEligibility criteria of small farmers agriculture cooperatives. An eligible SFAC meets \nthe following criteria: (i) capital adequacy ratio of 10% or above, (ii) internally generated funds-to-\noutstanding loan ratio of 40% or above, (iii) positive net worth, (iv) operating self-sufficiency ratio \nof 110% or above, (v) repayment rate ratio of 90% or above, (vi) active members comprise 90% \nor more of the total membership, (vii) return on equity ratio of 3% or above, (viii) operating expense \nratio below 4%, (ix) growth in outstanding loans of 15% or above, (x) outstanding loans of more \nthan NRs30 million, (xi) more than 500 total members, (xii) operating profit in the last 2-year period \nwith  no  cumulative  loss,  and  (xiii)  nonperforming  loan  ratio  below  5%.26  Further,  each  eligible \n\n                                                \n26 Capital  adequacy  ratio  is  defined  as  total  capital  fund  to  an  asset  base  of  total  assets  less  cash,  80%  of  bank \nplacements  and  50%  of  equity  investments.  The  internally  generated  funds  comprise  member  equity,  member \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSFAC should (i) be registered as a cooperative; (ii) have developed a 3-year business plan and \nimplemented  activities  in  line  with  the  plan;  (iii)  have  no  delinquent  loans  with  the  board  of \ndirectors, staff and their family members in the  cooperatives, or other financial institutions; (iv) \nhave no board of directors or staff and their family members who have taken out loans more than \nthe loan limit of the SFAC; (v) have been maintaining proper record keeping consistent with the \nNepal  Accounting  Standards.

SFDB  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency  and  financial  intermediary.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  formed \nchaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Finance and comprising members from the FSMCCD, \nNRB, and SFDB. The project implementation unit will be established at SFDB and led by a project \ncoordinator  with  at  least  two  full-time  staff  whose  qualifications  are  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).27 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n\nsavings, and internal reserves.

SFDB will provide counterpart support equivalent to $30,000 in the \nform of office space, counterpart staff, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n35. \nSFDB  is  highly  skilled  in  developing  saving  and  credit  cooperatives  and  providing \nwholesale  loans  for  microcredit.  It  has  established  operational  procedures  and  skilled  staff  for \nloan  appraisal,  loan  sanction,  and  portfolio  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  project  will  develop \nSFDB\u2019s rural enterprise financing skills through the attached TA. SFACs to be financed under the \n                                                \n28 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nproject will be registered cooperatives and will meet the project eligibility criteria. SFDB will assist \ncapacity development for SFACs\u2019 rural enterprise financing. \n \nB. \n \nThe unmet rural enterprise financing demand was estimated at NRs106 billion in 2018.29 \n36. \nRegarding  financial  viability,  SFDB  is  financially  sound  as  indicated  by  its  satisfactory  capital \nadequacy  ratio,  low  nonperforming  asset  ratio,  and  high  return  on  equity  and  assets.  SFDB\u2019s \ninterest  rate  risk  is  appropriately  managed  but  could  be  strengthened.  Based  on  the  financial \nanalysis  of  20  sample  SFACs,  their  financial  performance  is  acceptable;  however,  SFACs  are \nsusceptible to credit risk, operational risk, and interest rate risk, which will be mitigated through \nperiodical and structured monitoring. SFACs\u2019 credit demand is robust as evidenced by the growth \nof  SFDB\u2019s  loans  outstanding  with  SFACs,  which  increased  from  NRs3.6  billion  in  FY2013  to \nNRs16.9 billion in FY2018.30 \n \nC. \n \n37. \nCurrently,  SFDB  and  SFACs  have  limited  capacity  in  enterprise  financing.  The  project, \nthrough the attached TA, will develop SFDB\u2019s and SFACs\u2019 enterprise financing capacity especially \nin business appraisal, due diligence, risk assessment, financial management, and safeguards to \nensure the sustainability of the rural enterprise subprojects. SFDB will finance only those SFACs \nand  sub-borrowers  that  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  and  have  strong  financial  viability  and \nsustainability.  SFDB  will  ensure  that  the  interest  rates  to  be  charged  for  SFACs  and  the  sub-\nborrowers  cover  all  costs  and  risks  and  have  adequate  margin  to  ensure  operational \nsustainability. \n \nD. \n \nADB requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, and \n38. \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were discussed and agreed with the government and SFDB \nand  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  specific  requirements  are  described  in  the  PAM. \nProcurement  of  goods,  works,  and  non-consultancy  services  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  individual \nbeneficiary;  fitness  for  purpose  can  be  achieved  by  using  established  private  sector  and \ncommercial practices. \n \n39. \nSFDB\u2019s  governance  is  found  adequate.  SFDB\u2019s  board  of  directors  comprises  seven \nrepresentatives: four from the promotor group, two from the general public, and one independent \nprofessional  director.  SFDB  selects  and  lends  only  to  SFACs  whose  operational  and  financial \nindicators are sound. As a licensed class D institution, SFDB is required to comply with NRB\u2019s \nregulations and directives, and is subject to regular on-site and off-site supervision. \n \n40. \nThe  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  SFDB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  assessment  indicated  that  SFDB  has  sufficient  experience  in  managing  similar \nprojects for ADB and other international development partners and has the necessary financial \nmanagement  arrangements.31  However,  some  weaknesses  were  identified,  including  the \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n29 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\ffollowing:  (i)  outdated  management  information  systems;  (ii)  heavy  reliance  on  short-term \nborrowing; (iii) weak financial management capacity; (iv) limited human resources in internal audit; \n(v) limited capacity for rural enterprise financing; (vi) inadequate internal control mechanism; and \n(vii) a lack of policies on know-your-customer, risk management, and information technology. \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  relevant  Operations \n\n41. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and SFDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nE. \n \n42. \nThe project will generate employment or provide income earning opportunities to at least \n30,000 small farmers, including at least 12,000 women. By involving subsistence small farmers \nin rural enterprises, these farmers can gain better prices from their produce. Currently, 75% of \nSFAC members are women. However, majority of women members have limited credit history \nand  entrepreneurship  skills.  The  project  will  develop  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship  skills  with \nappropriate client protection. The project is classified gender equity as a theme.32 \n \nF. \n \n43. \nManual definitions, the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.33 \n \n44. \nEnvironment (category FI). The project\u2019s environmental due diligence found the existing \nSFDB financed collective enterprises as category C. However, so as not to exclude the potential \ncategory  B  subprojects,  implementation  of  an  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS) is made mandatory. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  FI-C);  Indigenous  peoples  (category  FI).  Only \n45. \nsubprojects  not  requiring  any  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  financed.  The  project  can  have \npositive  impacts  for  indigenous  peoples  by  providing  them  access  to  finance.  If  indigenous \npeoples  safeguards  are  triggered,  SFDB  will  follow  the  ESMS  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for \nindigenous peoples. \n \n46. \nSFDB  developed  an  ESMS,  which  was  agreed  by  ADB.  Subproject  screening  will  be \nmandatory for all subprojects to be financed under the project, and SFDB will report on the status \nof the screening checklist to ADB. SFDB will do the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIts regional offices will screen all subprojects to be financed under the project to \nensure  compliance  with  government  regulations,  project  legal  agreements,  the \nPAM, and environmental and social screening guidelines. \n \nIt  will  exclude  all  subprojects  categorized  A  for  environment  and  indigenous \npeoples,  and  A  and  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  For  category  B  subprojects, \nSFDB  will  prepare  an  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement plan, or an indigenous peoples plan, and submit the appropriate plan \nfor ADB\u2019s approval, before the subproject is financed. \n\n                                                \n32 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n33 ADB.
