India\u2019s  mortgage \npenetration rate was a very low 7.6% at the end of FY2013, compared with rates of 20% in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and 81% in the United States.2 Most of India\u2019s financial institutions \ntarget  their  housing  finance  products  primarily  at  the  medium-  and  high-income  groups. \nConsequently, the country\u2019s housing unit owners are mostly from the middle- and high-income \nbrackets\u2014i.e., with monthly incomes of at least Rs25,000. This group makes up only about 8% \nof the  urban  population.  Of the  73 million  households  in the  low  income categories,  24  million \nearn Rs10,000\u2013Rs25,000 per month and have the capacity to purchase private housing. About \n40%\u201345% of these households live in low-quality rented accommodations and would like to buy \ntheir own homes.3 \n \nThe government and India\u2019s private sector need to work together to increase the supply \n3. \nof  housing  stock  to  meet  the  huge  potential  demand  for  affordable  housing  from  low-income \nhouseholds  and,  at  the  same  time,  alleviate  the  obstacles  low-income  customers  face  in \naccessing  housing  finance.  This  is  particularly  important  for  those  with  low-salaried  jobs  or \nworking in the informal sectors. Mortgage loans with terms longer than those now available can \nhelp  address  the  financing  constraints  because  they  reduce  monthly  installments  and  thereby \nmake  home  ownership  more  affordable.  However,  commercial  banks  and  housing  finance \ncompanies  (HFCs)  typically  rely  on  short-term  funding,  and  the  long-term  nature  of  housing \nloans increases the potential problem of a maturity mismatch between asset and liabilities. This \nlimits the ability of lenders to lengthen loan tenors and expand mortgage operations, particularly \nin underserved markets. While many commercial banks also provide mortgage loans, they tend \nto  focus  on  middle-  and  high-income  borrowers.  This  means  that  to  give  India\u2019s  low-income \nhouseholds  better  access  to  housing  finance  and  to  maximize  development  impact,    strong \nHFCs that have a successful record in reaching low-income customers need to be supported.  \n \n4. \nAmong  10  HFCs  identified  by  Deloitte  Touche  Tohmatsu  as  active  lenders  in  the  low-\ncost  housing  market  (unit  costs  of  below  Rs1  million),  Dewan  Housing  Finance  Corporation \n(DHFL)  is  the  undisputed  market  leader  (footnote  3).4   At  the  end  of  FY2013,  its  total  lending \nwas 4.5 times that of the second largest HFC and more than 81 times that of the third largest \nHFC  in  this  group.  While  DHFL  started  operations  in  1984  with  a  focus  on  low-  and  middle-\nincome  borrowers,  8  out  of  the  10  HFCs  in  this  segment  were  established  after  2007.  These \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Mortgage penetration is measured by the total mortgage loans-to-GDP ratio.

Mumbai.  \n\n4  Among all the 56 HFCs in India, DHFL ranks the second in terms of total assets. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n9. \n \n\n \n10. \n \n11. \n \n\nnew  companies  have  experienced  rapid  growth  but  remain  small,  have  limited  geographical \nreach, are still developing risk management systems, and have higher credit risks. \n \n5. \nDHFL  is  a  strong  candidate  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funding  due  to  its \nsuccessful track record and competitive advantage in providing financing for low-cost affordable \nhousing  (LCAH). 5  It  has  concentrated  on  low-  and  middle-income  borrowers  since  its \nestablishment.  DHFL  has  developed  an  extensive  nationwide  branch  network,  formulated \ncomprehensive  credit  policies  and  procedures,  and  built  up  an  experienced  underwriting  and \nportfolio  team  that  has  a  deep  understanding  of  the  target  segment  and  provides  superior \nservices  to  its  customers.  This  focus  and  expertise  have  enabled  DHFL  to  be  selective  in \nunderwriting  and  proactive  in  portfolio  monitoring.  As  a  result,  it  has  consistently  maintained \nexcellent credit quality. \n \n6. \nADB has developed a good relationship with DHFL through a $20 million loan approved \nin 2003 for private housing finance sector development.6  ADB is keen to support the company\u2019s \ncontinuing growth and particularly in the low cost affordable housing segment. The loan will help \nimprove  DHFL\u2019s  access  to  long-term  finance,  which  remains  a key  challenge  for  HFCs  and  is \ncritical to expanding affordable housing loans.  The project will allow ADB to help widen DHFL\u2019s \naccess  to  financing  in  less-developed  states,  where  the  problem  can  be  particularly  acute, \nbecause 40% of the loan proceeds will be put to work in these parts of the country. \n \nB. \n \n7. \n \n8. \n \nC. \n \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n \n12. \nThe  board  of  directors,  which  provides  leadership  and  strategic  guidance,  consists  of \neight  members,  including  five  independent  non-executive  directors.  The  chairman  and \nmanaging  director,  Kapil  Wadhawan,  is  the  only  executive  director  on  the  board.  While  he  is \ninvolved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  DHFL,  the  non-executive  directors  provide  wider \nexternal  perspective  in  decision  making,  as  well  as  independence.

(This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due \nto  commercially  sensitive \ninformation.)  A  portion  of the  risk  on  ADB\u2019s  loan may  be  transferred to  counterparties  that  are \neligible under ADB\u2019s policies.7  \n \n18. \nThe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  purchases  by  prospective \nowners of LCAH units in India. In accordance with the applicable NHB and the RBI regulations, \nLCAH is currently defined as housing units with a maximum floor area of 60 square meters and \na  maximum  cost  of  Rs3  million.  LCAH  loan  to  individual  subborrowers  is  also  subject  to  a \ncurrent cap of Rs2.5 million in terms of maximum loan amount. At least 40% of the proceeds of \nthe ADB loan will be onlent to subborrowers in some of India\u2019s least-developed states, including \nAndhra  Pradesh,  Chattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  Uttarakhand,  Uttar \nPradesh and West Bengal. DHFL agrees that at least 50% of the subborrowers whose loans are \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s loan will be women or include women as coborrowers with their husbands. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nUse  of  proceeds.  The  use  of  proceeds  will  follow  the  RBI  regulation  on  external \ncommercial  borrowing  (ECB).  DHFL  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  exclusively  to \nfinance LCAH unit owners\u2019 mortgage loans. \n \n20.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  of  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department. DHFL will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular \nintervals  and  as  requested.  These  reports  will  include  (i)  unaudited  financial  statements  on  a \nquarterly basis, (ii) audited financial statements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates \nfor  financial  covenants  on  a  semiannual  basis,  (iv)  reporting  on  mortgage  portfolio  on  a \n                                                \n7  The terms of the risk transfer arrangements, if any, will be endorsed by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \nD. \n \n23. \n \n\n \n24. \n \n\n \n\nsemiannual  basis,  and  (v)  annual  reporting  on  selected  development  indicators  agreed  on  by \nADB and the borrower. \n \n21. \nEvaluation.  Pursuant to  ADB\u2019s  operations  manual,  monitoring reports  will  be  prepared \nand  submitted  to  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Risk  Management  regularly  and  at  least  annually.8 The  first \nsuch report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n22. \n \n\nADB\u2019s loan for DHFL will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nProviding long-term finance for low-cost affordable housing. The project will \nprovide  critically  needed  long-term  funding  to  support  the  scaling  up  of  DHFL \noperations  in  underserved  market  segments.  India\u2019s  capital  markets  are  still  in \nthe  early  stages  of  development,  and  access  to  long-term  funding  is  thus  a \nchallenge for HFCs.9 The funding bottleneck hampers the HFCs\u2019 growth. This is \nparticularly  the  case  in  their  LCAH  finance  businesses,  due  to  the  lower  profit \nmargins. The government has recognized this market constraint and, given that \nthis is a priority sector, the RBI has provided a $1 billion ECB quota for LCAH in \nFY2014. International commercial banks are not willing to lend for longer tenors, \nand ADB is thus filling this market gap. (This sentence has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.)  \nCatalyzing  private  sector  participation.  ADB is in discussions with insurers to \nmobilize  risk  participation,  which  would  increase  private  sector  confidence  and \nexposure in DHFL and, more broadly, in the housing sector in India \nIncorporating gender elements in LCAH finance. ADB\u2019s presence has helped \nincorporate  a  number  of  elements  in  the  project  to  improve  access  to  housing \nfinance and housing ownership by women. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRisks \n\nKey risks include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOperational  environment.

(This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially \nsensitive information.) \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. \n9  The  NHB,  the  regulator  and  provider  of  refinancing,  provides  access  to  long-tenor  financing  but  not  in  large \nquantities. DHFL is able to mobilize deposits but these tend to be short term in nature. Given that more than 51% \nof DHFL\u2019s loan portfolio has tenors of more than 10 years, it needs funding with longer terms.  \n\n\f5 \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n \nHousing  sector  development  supports  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  by \n25. \ngenerating  employment,  improving  housing,  and  raising  standards  of  living.  According  to  a \nrecent ADB study, Rs1 million invested in construction creates 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled \nand  semiskilled,  and  9,000  managerial  and  technical  person-days  of  employment  in  India.10  \nHousing  finance  also  helps  to  develop  the  finance  sector  by  improving  its  overall  depth, \ndiversity, buoyancy, and resilience. In particular, the project is expected to lead to two significant \ndevelopment impacts:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nIncreased  low-cost  affordable  housing  ownership  in  India.  Funding constraints \nprevent millions of low-income households from becoming homeowners and thereby \nimproving  their  living  conditions.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  government  of \nIndia\u2019s  targets  of  increased  home  ownership  by  low  income  households.  The \nproject\u2019s success will also help improve access to finance by encouraging lending to \nlow-income  subborrowers  who  are  underserved  by  the  commercial  banks,  in  the \ninformal sector and in the country\u2019s least-developed states. \n \n\n(ii)  Broadened  and  deepened  financial  market  with  development  of  housing \nfinance  companies.  The  project  will  promote  finance  sector  development  by \nsupporting the growth of HFCs, which have a limited deposit base and a great need \nfor  long-term  funding.  DHFL  has  been  a  pioneer  in  housing  finance;  it  availed  of \nIndia\u2019s  first  mortgage  guarantee  in  FY2014,  which  was  provided  by  the  India \nMortgage  Guarantee  Corporation,  an  ADB-backed  entity. 11 Such  transactions  not \nonly  helped  optimize  DHFL\u2019s  balance  sheet,  but  also  played  a  role  in  further \ndevelopment of domestic capital markets. (This sentence has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.) Many of the smaller new entrants in the market \ncontinue  to  replicate  aspects  of  its  business  model.  By  helping  DHFL  continue  to \ngrow its low-income housing finance business in underserved regions, the project will \ndemonstrate  the  commercial  viability  of  this  inclusive  approach,  which  will  lead  to \nbroadening and deepening of the housing finance market in India. \n\n \n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \nThe  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  sustainable  growth  of  DHFL\u2019s  LCAH  portfolio.  This \n26. \nwill be measured by an increasing share of LCAH in the overall loan portfolio as well as a low \nnon-performing  loan  ratio.    Steady  portfolio  growth  and  low  levels  of  loan  defaults  due  to \nprudent  credit  risk  assessment  and  management  will  ensure  continuing  access  to  housing \nfinance for low-income households from DHFL in India. \n  \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n \nThe project\u2019s output is increased growth and geographical expansion of DHFL\u2019s lending \n27. \nactivities  for  LCAH  throughout  India.  India\u2019s  mortgage  market  is  very  undeveloped  with  a  low \npenetration rate of only 7.6% (para. 2).The loan will provide much-needed housing finance that \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2013.

In  addition,  the  project  will \npromote specialized services for women borrowers, joint titles for houses, and training of staff. \n \nB. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \n28. \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  calls  for  strengthening  financial  sector \ndevelopment.12 The  project  contributes  to  this  objective  by  supporting  the  growth  of  HFCs,  an \nimportant component of the nonbank finance sector in India. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nalso  calls for  sharpening  ADB\u2019s  operational focus  on  inclusive economic growth, for  which the \nproject supports. Without access to formal financial services, the poor will be excluded from the \ngrowth  process  and  its  benefits.  By  targeting  low-income  subborrowers  and  people  in \nunderdeveloped  states,  many  of  whom  are  part  of  the  informal  economy,  the  project  will \nimprove access to finance and contribute to inclusive growth.  \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  India  for  2013\u20132017  calls  for  ADB\u2019s \n29. \nnonsovereign  operations  to  align  with  the  CPS  priority  areas  and  to  continue  to  support  the \ninfrastructure  and  finance  sectors  by  undertaking  selective  physical,  social,  and  financial \ninfrastructure projects.13 The project will support the development of housing finance in India, an \narea  of  financial  infrastructure  that  the  CPS  identifies  for  support.  By  helping  low-income \nhouseholds purchase homes that provide better living conditions, it will also help improve urban \nquality of life, which is the main objective of ADB\u2019s urban sector operations in India. By targeting \nless-developed states, it also supports inclusive growth, one of the three strategic pillars of the \nCPS.  The project will help to improve access to affordable formal credit, as recommended by \nan  RBI  committee  on  comprehensive  financial  services  for  small  businesses  and  low-income \nhouseholds.14 It also supports the government\u2019s priority of promoting affordable housing, which \nwas  identified  in  the  country\u2019s  twelfth  five-year  plan  (2012\u20132017)  as  a  particularly  critical \nconcern for low-income groups.15 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \nSupporting  finance  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  development  assistance  for \n30. \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy  stated  that  ADB  should  play  a  role  in \nstrengthening  the  finance  sector  in  developing  member  countries,  including  housing  finance.16 \nADB\u2019s  enhanced  poverty  reduction  strategy  states  that  ADB  seeks  to  promote  sound  and \nefficient  financial  markets  to  mobilize  savings,  ensure  availability  of  long-term  financing,  and \nachieve pro-poor growth.17 ADB\u2019s operational plan for the finance sector calls for ADB to support \nbroad  household  access  to  microfinance  and  housing  finance.18 The  project  will  improve  the \nquality of life in the urban regions in India and is thus in line with ADB\u2019s urban operational plan.19  \n \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

The \nproject  was  rated  successful  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  in  2008.  The \nevaluation  report  highlighted  the  importance  of  having  highly  trained,  experienced  staff,  and \nsound credit underwriting and portfolio policies for the success of the company. (This sentence \nhas been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.) \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  FI  (treated  as  C)  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \n32. \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  The  project  is  expected  to  have  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts.  DHFL \nwill not finance real estate development or mass housing construction. It will onlend ADB\u2019s loan \nin the form of mortgage loans to individuals, primarily in urban  and semi-urban areas. No land \nacquisition  or  physical  or  economic  displacements  are  expected  from  the  activities  of  the \nborrower,  since  the  housing  loans  will  be  provided  to  individuals  who  have  purchased  the \nproperty with mortgage or are voluntarily making improvements to their dwellings. While a few of \nthe beneficiaries may be identified as members of tribal groups based on their cultural identity, \nthey are not expected to possess the characteristics of indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  DHFL  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  activities  list  and  ensure  that \ninvestments  using  ADB  funds  comply  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Social Protection Strategy.20 \n \n33. \nThe borrower will need to comply with national labor laws and internationally recognized \ncore  labor  standards.  DHFL  is  an  equal  opportunity  employer  and  has  a  gender-equal  human \nresource  policy.  The  transaction  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  under  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.  At  least  50%  of  the  new  home  loans  funded  by  the  project  will  be  to  women \nborrowers  who  have  either  single  or  joint  (with  husband)  ownership  and  title  of  property.  In \naddition,  DHFL  will  implement  the  measures  outlined  in  the  gender  action  plan  to  promote \ngender equality in its operations.21  \n \nB. \n \nDHFL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \n34. \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \nIndia  is  a  jurisdiction  in  which  no  strategic  deficiencies  have  been  identified  by  the  Financial \nAction Task Force, and no integrity red flag has been identified. \n \nC. \n \n35. \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2001.
