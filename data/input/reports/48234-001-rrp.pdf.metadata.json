I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $125,000,000 (or in Indian rupee equivalent) to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation for \nthe Low-Cost Affordable Housing Finance in India.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  India suffers from an acute housing shortage, which stood at 18.78 million units in 2012. \nAccording to the country\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, more than 95% of \nthe households affected by this shortage were those with annual incomes of Rs200,000 or less. \nThe  shortage  of  housing  is  compounded  by  a  lack  of  housing  finance.  India\u2019s  mortgage \npenetration rate was a very low 7.6% at the end of FY2013, compared with rates of 20% in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and 81% in the United States.2 Most of India\u2019s financial institutions \ntarget  their  housing  finance  products  primarily  at  the  medium-  and  high-income  groups. \nConsequently, the country\u2019s housing unit owners are mostly from the middle- and high-income \nbrackets\u2014i.e., with monthly incomes of at least Rs25,000. This group makes up only about 8% \nof the urban population. Of the 73 million households in the low income categories, 24 million \nearn Rs10,000\u2013Rs25,000 per month and have the capacity to purchase private housing. About \n40%\u201345% of these households live in low-quality rented accommodations and would like to buy \ntheir own homes.3 \n \n3.  The government and India\u2019s private sector need to work together to increase the supply \nof housing stock to meet the huge potential demand for affordable housing from low-income \nhouseholds  and,  at  the  same  time,  alleviate  the  obstacles  low-income  customers  face  in \naccessing housing finance. This is particularly important for those with low-salaried jobs or \nworking in the informal sectors. Mortgage loans with terms longer than those now available can \nhelp address the financing constraints because they reduce monthly installments and thereby \nmake  home  ownership  more  affordable.  However,  commercial  banks  and  housing  finance \ncompanies (HFCs) typically rely on short-term funding, and the long-term nature of housing \nloans increases the potential problem of a maturity mismatch between asset and liabilities. This \nlimits the ability of lenders to lengthen loan tenors and expand mortgage operations, particularly \nin underserved markets. While many commercial banks also provide mortgage loans, they tend \nto focus on middle- and high-income borrowers. This means that to give India\u2019s low-income \nhouseholds better access to housing finance and to maximize development impact,  strong \nHFCs that have a successful record in reaching low-income customers need to be supported.  \n \n4.  Among 10 HFCs identified by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as active lenders in the low-\ncost housing market (unit costs of below Rs1 million), Dewan Housing Finance Corporation \n(DHFL) is the undisputed market leader (footnote 3).4  At the end of FY2013, its total lending \nwas 4.5 times that of the second largest HFC and more than 81 times that of the third largest \nHFC in this group. While DHFL started operations in 1984 with a focus on low- and middle-\nincome borrowers, 8 out of the 10 HFCs in this segment were established after 2007. These \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Mortgage penetration is measured by the total mortgage loans-to-GDP ratio.

Mumbai.  \n4  Among all the 56 HFCs in India, DHFL ranks the second in terms of total assets. \n ", "2 \nnew companies have experienced rapid growth but remain small, have limited geographical \nreach, are still developing risk management systems, and have higher credit risks. \n \n5.  DHFL is a strong candidate for Asian Development Bank (ADB) funding due to its \nsuccessful track record and competitive advantage in providing financing for low-cost affordable \nhousing  (LCAH). 5  It  has  concentrated  on  low-  and  middle-income  borrowers  since  its \nestablishment.  DHFL  has  developed  an  extensive  nationwide  branch  network,  formulated \ncomprehensive credit policies and procedures, and built up an experienced underwriting and \nportfolio team that has a deep understanding of the target segment and provides superior \nservices to its customers. This focus and expertise have enabled DHFL to be selective in \nunderwriting and proactive in portfolio monitoring. As a result, it has consistently maintained \nexcellent credit quality. \n \n6.  ADB has developed a good relationship with DHFL through a $20 million loan approved \nin 2003 for private housing finance sector development.6  ADB is keen to support the company\u2019s \ncontinuing growth and particularly in the low cost affordable housing segment. The loan will help \nimprove DHFL\u2019s access to long-term finance, which remains a key challenge for HFCs and is \ncritical to expanding affordable housing loans.  The project will allow ADB to help widen DHFL\u2019s \naccess to financing in less-developed states, where the problem can be particularly acute, \nbecause 40% of the loan proceeds will be put to work in these parts of the country. \n \nB.

This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n \n12.  The board of directors, which provides leadership and strategic guidance, consists of \neight  members,  including  five  independent  non-executive  directors.  The  chairman  and \nmanaging director, Kapil Wadhawan, is the only executive director on the board. While he is \ninvolved in the day-to-day management of DHFL, the non-executive directors provide wider \nexternal perspective in decision making, as well as independence. The board members are \nseasoned  professionals  with  diverse  backgrounds  in  such  fields  as  finance,  accounting, \n                                                \n5  National Housing Bank and Reserve Bank of India define LCAH as housing units with a floor area of up to 60 \nsquare meters and a cost of up to Rs3 million. \n6  ADB. 2003.

The earlier ADB loan will be fully paid in November 2014. ", "  3 \nregulation, and government. DHFL has constituted five committees that focus on important \nareas and functions: an audit committee, a shareholders and investors\u2019 grievance committee, a \nremuneration  and  compensation  committee,  a  finance  committee,  and  a  corporate  social \nresponsibility committee.  DHFL\u2019s corporate governance policy aims to ensure that the board \nremains well-informed, independent, and actively involved in the important decisions pertaining \nto the company. \n \nD.

ADB will provide a senior secured term loan to DHFL of up to $125 million (or in Indian \nrupee  equivalent).  (This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive \ninformation.) A portion of the risk on ADB\u2019s loan may be transferred to counterparties that are \neligible under ADB\u2019s policies.7  \n \n18.  The proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan will be used to finance the purchases by  prospective \nowners of LCAH units in India. In accordance with the applicable NHB and the RBI regulations, \nLCAH is currently defined as housing units with a maximum floor area of 60 square meters and \na maximum cost of Rs3 million. LCAH loan to individual subborrowers is also subject to a \ncurrent cap of Rs2.5 million in terms of maximum loan amount. At least 40% of the proceeds of \nthe ADB loan will be onlent to subborrowers in some of India\u2019s least-developed states, including \nAndhra  Pradesh,  Chattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  Uttarakhand,  Uttar \nPradesh and West Bengal. DHFL agrees that at least 50% of the subborrowers whose loans are \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s loan will be women or include women as coborrowers with their husbands. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Use  of  proceeds.  The  use  of  proceeds  will  follow  the  RBI  regulation  on  external \ncommercial  borrowing  (ECB).  DHFL  will  use the  proceeds  of the  ADB  loan  exclusively  to \nfinance LCAH unit owners\u2019 mortgage loans. \n \n20.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  of  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department. DHFL will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular \nintervals and as requested. These reports will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a \nquarterly basis, (ii) audited financial statements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates \nfor  financial  covenants  on  a  semiannual  basis,  (iv)  reporting  on  mortgage  portfolio  on  a \n                                                \n7  The terms of the risk transfer arrangements, if any, will be endorsed by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n ", "4 \nsemiannual basis, and (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed on by \nADB and the borrower. \n \n21.  Evaluation. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s operations manual, monitoring reports will be prepared \nand submitted to ADB\u2019s Office of Risk Management regularly and at least annually.8 The first \nsuch report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s loan for DHFL will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n \n(i)  Providing long-term finance for low-cost affordable housing. The project will \nprovide critically needed long-term funding to support the scaling up of DHFL \noperations in underserved market segments. India\u2019s capital markets are still in \nthe early stages of development, and access to long-term funding is thus a \nchallenge for HFCs.9 The funding bottleneck hampers the HFCs\u2019 growth. This is \nparticularly the case in their LCAH finance businesses, due to the lower profit \nmargins. The government has recognized this market constraint and, given that \nthis is a priority sector, the RBI has provided a $1 billion ECB quota for LCAH in \nFY2014. International commercial banks are not willing to lend for longer tenors, \nand ADB is thus filling this market gap. (This sentence has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.)  \n(ii)  Catalyzing private sector participation. ADB is in discussions with insurers to \nmobilize risk participation, which would increase private sector confidence and \nexposure in DHFL and, more broadly, in the housing sector in India \n(iii)  Incorporating gender elements in LCAH finance. ADB\u2019s presence has helped \nincorporate a number of elements in the project to improve access to housing \nfinance and housing ownership by women. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n23.  Key risks include the following: \n \n(i)  Operational environment. (This sentence has been redacted due to commercially \nsensitive information.) \n(ii)  Asset  quality. (This sentence has been redacted due to commercially sensitive \ninformation.) \n(iii)  Funding and liquidity risk.  (This sentence has been redacted due to commercially \nsensitive information.) \n(iv)  Foreign exchange risk. (This sentence has been redacted due to commercially \nsensitive information.) \n \n24.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. \n9  The NHB, the regulator and provider of refinancing, provides access to long-tenor financing but not in large \nquantities. DHFL is able to mobilize deposits but these tend to be short term in nature. Given that more than 51% \nof DHFL\u2019s loan portfolio has tenors of more than 10 years, it needs funding with longer terms.  ", "  5 \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n1.  Impacts \n \n25.  Housing  sector  development  supports  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  by \ngenerating employment, improving housing, and raising standards of living. According to a \nrecent ADB study, Rs1 million invested in construction creates 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled \nand semiskilled, and 9,000 managerial and technical person-days of employment in India.10  \nHousing  finance  also  helps  to  develop  the  finance  sector  by  improving  its  overall  depth, \ndiversity, buoyancy, and resilience. In particular, the project is expected to lead to two significant \ndevelopment impacts:  \n \n(i)  Increased low-cost affordable housing ownership in India. Funding constraints \nprevent millions of low-income households from becoming homeowners and thereby \nimproving their living conditions. The project will contribute to the government of \nIndia\u2019s  targets  of  increased  home  ownership  by  low  income  households.  The \nproject\u2019s success will also help improve access to finance by encouraging lending to \nlow-income subborrowers who are underserved by the commercial banks, in the \ninformal sector and in the country\u2019s least-developed states. \n \n(ii)  Broadened  and  deepened  financial  market  with  development  of  housing \nfinance  companies.  The  project  will  promote  finance  sector  development  by \nsupporting the growth of HFCs, which have a limited deposit base and a great need \nfor long-term funding. DHFL has been a pioneer in housing finance; it availed of \nIndia\u2019s  first  mortgage  guarantee  in  FY2014,  which  was  provided  by  the  India \nMortgage Guarantee Corporation, an ADB-backed entity.11 Such transactions not \nonly  helped  optimize  DHFL\u2019s  balance  sheet,  but  also  played  a  role  in  further \ndevelopment of domestic capital markets. (This sentence has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.) Many of the smaller new entrants in the market \ncontinue to replicate aspects of its business model. By helping DHFL continue to \ngrow its low-income housing finance business in underserved regions, the project will \ndemonstrate the commercial viability of this inclusive approach, which will lead to \nbroadening and deepening of the housing finance market in India. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n26.  The project\u2019s expected outcome is sustainable growth of DHFL\u2019s LCAH portfolio. This \nwill be measured by an increasing share of LCAH in the overall loan portfolio as well as a low \nnon-performing loan ratio.  Steady portfolio growth and low levels of loan defaults due to \nprudent credit risk assessment and management will ensure continuing access to housing \nfinance for low-income households from DHFL in India. \n  \n3.  Output \n \n27.  The project\u2019s output is increased growth and geographical expansion of DHFL\u2019s lending \nactivities for LCAH throughout India. India\u2019s mortgage market is very undeveloped with a low \npenetration rate of only 7.6% (para. 2).The loan will provide much-needed housing finance that \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013.

In addition, the project will \npromote specialized services for women borrowers, joint titles for houses, and training of staff. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  calls  for  strengthening  financial  sector \ndevelopment.12 The project contributes to this objective by supporting the growth of HFCs, an \nimportant component of the nonbank finance sector in India. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nalso calls for sharpening ADB\u2019s operational focus on inclusive economic growth, for which the \nproject supports. Without access to formal financial services, the poor will be excluded from the \ngrowth  process  and  its  benefits.  By  targeting  low-income  subborrowers  and  people  in \nunderdeveloped  states,  many  of  whom  are  part  of  the  informal  economy,  the  project  will \nimprove access to finance and contribute to inclusive growth.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  India  for  2013\u20132017  calls  for  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign operations to align with the CPS priority areas and to continue to support the \ninfrastructure  and  finance  sectors  by  undertaking  selective  physical,  social,  and  financial \ninfrastructure projects.13 The project will support the development of housing finance in India, an \narea  of  financial  infrastructure  that  the  CPS  identifies  for  support.  By  helping  low-income \nhouseholds purchase homes that provide better living conditions, it will also help improve urban \nquality of life, which is the main objective of ADB\u2019s urban sector operations in India. By targeting \nless-developed states, it also supports inclusive growth, one of the three strategic pillars of the \nCPS.  The project will help to improve access to affordable formal credit, as recommended by \nan RBI committee on comprehensive financial services for small businesses and low-income \nhouseholds.14 It also supports the government\u2019s priority of promoting affordable housing, which \nwas  identified  in  the  country\u2019s  twelfth five-year  plan  (2012\u20132017)  as  a  particularly  critical \nconcern for low-income groups.15 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n30.  Supporting finance sector development is a key focus of development assistance for \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy  stated  that  ADB  should  play  a  role  in \nstrengthening the finance sector in developing member countries, including housing finance.16 \nADB\u2019s enhanced poverty reduction strategy states that ADB seeks to promote sound and \nefficient financial markets to mobilize savings, ensure availability of long-term financing, and \nachieve pro-poor growth.17 ADB\u2019s operational plan for the finance sector calls for ADB to support \nbroad household access to microfinance and housing finance.18 The project will improve the \nquality of life in the urban regions in India and is thus in line with ADB\u2019s urban operational plan.19  \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

ADB first supported DHFL through a $20 million loan approved in 2003 (footnote 5).  The \nproject  was  rated  successful  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  in  2008.  The \nevaluation report highlighted the importance of having highly trained, experienced staff, and \nsound credit underwriting and portfolio policies for the success of the company. (This sentence \nhas been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.) \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n32.  The project is classified as category FI (treated as C) for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The project is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. DHFL \nwill not finance real estate development or mass housing construction. It will onlend ADB\u2019s loan \nin the form of mortgage loans to individuals, primarily in urban and semi-urban areas. No land \nacquisition  or  physical  or  economic  displacements  are  expected  from  the  activities  of  the \nborrower, since the housing loans will be provided to individuals who have purchased the \nproperty with mortgage or are voluntarily making improvements to their dwellings. While a few of \nthe beneficiaries may be identified as members of tribal groups based on their cultural identity, \nthey are not expected to possess the characteristics of indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. DHFL will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited activities list and ensure that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with applicable national laws and regulations and with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Social Protection Strategy.20 \n \n33.
