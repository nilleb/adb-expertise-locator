THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Fiscal Resilience Improvement Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based grant to the Independent State of Samoa for subprogram 1 of the Fiscal Resilience \nImprovement Program.1 \n \n2.  The policy-based program is designed to improve Samoa\u2019s macroeconomic stability and \nto strengthen the country\u2019s fiscal resilience. It supports the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal \nframework (MTFF) through the implementation of the joint policy action matrix (JPAM) on public \nfinancial management (PFM) policies and processes, developed by the Government of Samoa \nand its development partners.2 \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development context. As a small (population 180,000) island state with a very open \neconomy, Samoa is highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks and faces particular challenges in \nachieving sustainable development. The global economic crisis in 2008, a tsunami in 2009, and \nTropical  Cyclone  Evan  in  2012  have  had  adverse,  long-lasting  impacts  on  growth,  which \naveraged just 1.2% during FY2008\u2013FY2015, well below the 4.3% average during FY1999\u2013\nFY2007. Growth increased to 6.4% in FY2016 with strong performance in the fishing, tourism, \ntransport, and construction sectors. New fishing operators have contributed to a more than \ndoubling of output over FY2015 and FY2016. Growth in visitor arrivals has contributed to growth \nin the tourism and transport sectors. Upgrading of the airport and investments in hotels are \ncontributing to increased construction activity. Growth remains highly volatile, however, and is \nexpected  to  decline  to  2.0%  in  FY2017  as  a  result  of  the  imminent  closure  of  Samoa\u2019s \nautomotive wire harness plant (a significant manufacturing sector employer, with 740 staff).3 \n \n4.  Narrow and vulnerable economic base. Samoa\u2019s vulnerability stems in large part from \nits limited resources. The economy is characterized by a large nonmonetary sector and a \nrelatively  high  dependence  on  remittances  and  development  assistance.  Two-thirds  of  all \nSamoans depend on the agriculture sector for their livelihoods\u2014mainly small-scale subsistence \nfarming and fishing at the local level. The manufacturing sector (with the exception of the wire \nharness plant) largely processes agricultural produce, which makes up the bulk of Samoa\u2019s \nexports.  Tourism  accounts  for  approximately  25%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  with \nSamoa  receiving  approximately  135,000  visitors  per  year.  Samoa\u2019s  reliance  on  these  two \nsectors  increases  its  vulnerability  to  damage  and  loss  from  natural  disasters,  which  have \nimmediate impacts on the economy, and on the welfare of the majority of the population. Post-\ndisaster needs assessments following the recent disasters estimated that the tsunami cost the \neconomy $124 million in lost output, equivalent to 22% of GDP in 2009; Tropical Cyclone Evan \ncost $204 million in lost output, equivalent to 28% of GDP in 2012. \n \n5.  Private sector development is constrained. The small size of the economy precludes \nsome economic activity, while lack of scale means private sector firms are relatively small, \nlimiting the absorptive capacity for both aid and investment. The lack of access to finance, gaps \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Development partners include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the governments of Australia and New \nZealand, the European Union, and the World Bank. The list of linked documents is in Appendix 2, the development \npolicy letter is in Appendix 3, and the policy matrix for subprograms 1 and 2 is in Appendix 4. \n3  Radio  New  Zealand.  2016.  Yazaki  Samoa  to  shut  down  in  2017,  hundreds  to  lose  jobs.  12  October. \nwww.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/315443/yazaki-samoa-to-shut-down-in-2017,-hundreds-to-lose-jobs ", "2 \nin  the  commercial  legal  framework,  inefficient  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  barriers  to \nagricultural development, and poorly defined property rights are some of the identified barriers \nto private sector development. An opaque and difficult foreign investment regime has resulted in \nnet foreign direct investment averaging the equivalent of just 2.8% of GDP per year during \nFY2006\u2013FY2016. As a result of the constrained private sector, the public sector is left with a \nsignificantly large share of the burden of delivering necessary services, which has to be funded \nthrough  a  relatively  higher  proportion  of  taxes  and  other  sources  of  revenue.  Economic \ndiversification will lead to a more resilient economy in which the private sector is able to deliver \na wider range of services, with a reduced role for the public sector. Private sector growth is \nwidely acknowledged to be an essential component of poverty alleviation through the provision \nof an increased number and range of economic opportunities, thereby reducing the burden on \npublic delivery of poverty-alleviation measures.  \n \n6.  Financial inflows require diversification. Remittances and development assistance \ncontribute about a quarter of annual GDP. Remittances largely support private consumption and \nare an integral part of the traditional social welfare system that supports Samoa\u2019s largely rural-\nbased population. Following the global economic crisis, remittances declined from an average of \n22.0% of GDP in FY2004\u2013FY2009 to an average of 20.0% of GDP in FY2010\u2013FY2016; the \ndecline in remittances occurred despite the two subsequent natural disasters. The series of \nexogenous shocks caused growth to slow to an average of 1.2% in FY2008\u2013FY2015. Domestic \nrevenues declined sharply in FY2010\u2013FY2012 to an average of 23.2% of GDP, and then rose \nbeginning in FY2013, with domestic revenue collection reaching 26.8% of GDP in FY2016. The \ngovernment responded with a substantial fiscal stimulus financed by grants and domestic and \nexternal debt accumulation (largely concessional), as well as monetary stimulus in the form of \nlower interest rates. The government is committed to economic diversification to develop a more \nresilient  economic  structure.  Diversification  is  focused  beyond  the  agriculture  and  tourism \nsectors,  and  includes  recent  investments  in  the  transport  and  communication  sectors. \nDevelopment partners have worked closely with the government to provide support, with grants \naveraging 9.2% of GDP during FY2009\u2013FY2015. Growth has been slow to accelerate, however, \nand fiscal deficits and debt levels remain high.

Budgetary pressures. Although fiscal expansion undertaken in recognition of the weak \neconomic environment provided some impetus for growth, it resulted in high fiscal deficits and \nescalating  public  debt.  The  government  sought  to  stimulate  the  economy  through  public \ninvestments in infrastructure, but this did not result in higher growth. Expenditures on the \nhosting of regional and international events also did not result in higher visitor spending or the \nintended economic stimulus. Two\u2013thirds of the budget funded recurrent expenditures with one \nthird allocated to development expenditures. Interest was a major driver of the 10% annual \ngrowth in recurrent expenditures during FY2008\u2013FY2016; this compared with 3% growth in \nwage expenditures. Tax revenues have fluctuated since FY2008, falling to a low of 19.6% of \nGDP in FY2011 and FY2012, and gradually increasing to 24.2% of GDP in FY2016. Nontax \nrevenues fell from 3.3% of GDP in FY2008 to 1.9% in FY2013; following inflation adjustments to \ngovernment fees and charges, nontax revenues increased to 2.6% of GDP in FY2016. \n \n8.  Deficits  exceeded  targets.  Since  FY2009,  budget  deficits  have  exceeded  the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term target of 3.5% of GDP, and public debt rose from around 30% of GDP \nin FY2008 to about 53% in FY2016.4 The increase in debt was a result of both the recovery and \nreconstruction  needs  (power  sector  expansion,  agriculture  sector  support,  post-tsunami \nreconstruction, and general budget support loans), and the construction of a national broadband \nnetwork and public buildings funded by the China EXIM Bank (such as the convention center, a \nnational medical center, office complexes, and a recent upgrade of the airport terminal building). \nThe increase in debt requires the government to continuously strengthen its debt management. \nWith  the  recovery  phase  following  the  2012  cyclone  coming  to  an  end,  grant  assistance \ndeclined to an estimated 6.7% of GDP in FY2016 (from an average of 10.5% of GDP during \nFY2013\u2013FY2015), which required the government to reduce total expenditures. The fiscal deficit \nin  FY2016  was  reduced  to  0.4%  of  GDP,  which  was  largely  achieved  through  lower \ndevelopment and recurrent expenditures. \n \n9.  Planned fiscal consolidation. The government is committed to consolidating its fiscal \nposition, but the speed of consolidation needs to be managed carefully to minimize possible \nimpacts on poverty and hardship from low economic growth. Consequently, the government has \nrequested development partner support to help mitigate the macroeconomic challenges and \nbuild greater fiscal resilience. The government has been successful in reducing subsidies to \npublic corporations from 1.5% of GDP in FY2013 to 0.7% of GDP in FY2016. It is intended that \nprivate sector partnerships will further reduce the need for subsidies and facilitate private sector \ngrowth.  Goods  and  services  to  be  procured  in  FY2017  are  budgeted  at  12.5%  of  GDP. \nImprovements to  procurement  processes  will  help  introduce  efficiencies,  improve  value for \nmoney in public expenditures, and enhance public service delivery. Significant revenue reforms \nhave  taken  place,  notably  through  the  passage  of  legislation  in  2012.  Samoa\u2019s  Customs \nModernization Project is also nearing completion. These changes have resulted in improved \ntaxpayer compliance through increased awareness and enforcement. Government fees and \ncharges are being adjusted for inflation, resulting in significantly improved nontax revenue \ncollection. Revenue reforms are not included in the program to allow time for past reforms to be \nimplemented. Development partner support also assists Samoa maintain an adequate level of \nforeign exchange reserves. \n \n                                                \n4  Samoa is currently classified by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as a country at moderate risk \nof debt distress. This is an improvement on the FY2014 rating, which rated Samoa as being at high risk of debt \ndistress. International Monetary Fund. 2015. Debt Sustainability Analysis. Staff Report for the 2015 Article IV \nConsultation. Washington DC. The improvement is largely a result of technical changes, which include the use of a \nlonger-term reference interest rate, revised GDP estimates as a result of rebasing, and inclusion of remittances in \nthe analysis. \n ", "4 \n10.  Political commitment to reforms. The government has shown strong commitment to \nreforms that lead to efficient and effective delivery of public services. Phase 1 of the Public \nFinancial Management Reform Plan (PFMRP) was launched in 2008, under which aid policy \nand debt management strategies were developed, outcome-based budgeting was adopted, \nsector plans were prepared, and the Ministry of Revenue was strengthened. Phase 2 of the \nPFMRP commenced in 2011, and strengthened internal audit functions, implemented a debt \nmanagement reform plan, and developed a medium-term expenditure framework. Following the \n2012 cyclone, the government and development partners worked together to develop an MTFF \nincorporating integrated policies to achieve economic stability. The MTFF specified a clear path \nto bringing the government\u2019s fiscal position to more sustainable levels over 3\u20135 years, while \nmaintaining aggregate demand and improving productivity. The MTFF essentially lays the basis \nfor sustained economic growth through (i) support for structural reforms to improve medium-\nterm growth prospects, and (ii) support for mitigation strategies to strengthen climate resilience. \nSamoa is currently implementing phase 3 of its PFMRP. 5  \n \n11.  Programmatic approach. The program\u2019s proposed programmatic approach consists of \ntwo  subprograms,  and  is  part  of  the  sequenced  MTFF  reform  process  supported  by \ndevelopment  partners  (including  the  World  Bank,  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New \nZealand, and the European Union) to help the government reduce debt and achieve fiscal \nconsolidation, while focusing on reforms needed to build resilience and improve stability. The \nprogram  is  consistent  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  assessment  that  finds  fiscal \nconsolidation is consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals, and that continued reforms will \nhelp improve the business environment. It is designed to augment ongoing PFM reforms and \nwill be delivered within the JPAM. The program policy matrix is a subset of the JPAM. The \nJPAM involves regular policy dialogue between the government, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), and other development partners. The two subprograms allow flexibility for the program to \nrespond to ongoing and new risks to the economy and shifts in government priorities. The \nprogram  is  consistent with  the  Strategy for  the  Development  of  Samoa,  2012\u20132016.6 The \nrequest for a policy-based operation in 2016 was received during JPAM discussions in 2016, \nand followed up during the country programming mission for the country operations business \nplan, 2017\u20132019.7 \n \n12.  Lessons from previous programs. The program builds on the lessons of the Economic \nRecovery Support Program,8 the Public Sector Financial Management Program (PSFMP),9 and \nADB support for reform around the region. Lessons from these operations have highlighted the \nfollowing good practices, which have been incorporated in the program design: the need to \nensure (i) political ownership and understanding of the program, (ii) that program-supported \nprocesses  are mainstreamed  in  PFM  practices,  and (iii)  that  stakeholders  understand that \nreforms in a country vulnerable to disasters can take time to become self-sustaining. In Samoa\u2019s \ncontext, political ownership and understanding have been particularly necessary for reform \nprogress. The ongoing dialogue under the JPAM processes ensures continuing, coordinated \n                                                \n5  Phase 1 of the PFMRP (2008\u20132011) built on capacity-building initiatives prior to 2008; it was followed by phase 2 \n(2012\u20132014) and phase 3 (2015\u20132017). \n   www.mof.gov.ws/AboutUs/PublicFinanceManagementReforms/tabid/6008/Default.aspx \n6  Government of Samoa. 2012.

Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be maintained macroeconomic stability over the medium-term, which is a \nkey objective of the Strategy for the Development of Samoa, 2012\u20132016. The outcome will be \nimproved fiscal resilience. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The program is structured around four reform areas, including (i) reduction of fiscal drain \nthrough  SOE  reforms,  (ii)  improvement  of  procurement  systems,  (iii)  improvement  of  debt \nmanagement, and (iv) promotion of resilience to climate change and variability. Subprogram 1 \nhas 10 policy actions while 7 policy actions are proposed for Subprogram 2. ADB will support \nSamoa through regional technical assistance (TA) projects for SOE reform and public sector \nmanagement during the program. The ADB Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) TA will \nsupport a range of private sector reforms under way in Samoa that include assistance for \ndeveloping  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  pipeline. 10 PSDI  will  continue  support  for \nimproving the business regulatory environment. Support for climate change adaptation and \nmitigation activities will be guided by the ADB climate change implementation plan.11 All the \noutputs are fully aligned with the JPAM, and all policy actions under subprogram 1 have been \ncomplied with prior to the ADB Board of Directors\u2019 consideration of subprogram 1. \n \n15.  Output  1:  Fiscal  drain  reduced  through  state-owned  enterprise  reform.  SOE \nreforms have been introduced to improve performance and reduce their dependence on public \nfinances. Subsidies to public corporations in FY2016 are estimated at 0.7% of GDP. Following \nthe privatization of SamoaTel and the establishment of a joint venture with Virgin Airlines, \nSamoa has steadily reduced the number of civil servants and elected officials to comply with \nSchedule 3 of the regulations in the Public Bodies Act 2001. The reform program has made \nsignificant progress in improving the governance structures of the SOEs. In April 2014, a \nminister for public enterprises was appointed with sole responsibility for all SOEs, and a Ministry \nof Public Enterprises (MPE) was established in July 2015. \n \n16.  The government has approved a PPP framework for collaboration between SOEs and \nthe private sector, and for delivery of selected services. The MPE now has an established PPP \nDivision with technical support from ADB. ADB will continue its support for SOE reforms and \nfacilitate  business-enabling  reforms  through  the  regional  PSDI  TA. PPPs  offer  Samoa  the \npotential to boost opportunities for private sector involvement and investment, while at the same \ntime driving improvements in asset maintenance, operational efficiency, and service quality \namong  SOEs.  The  government  recognizes  that,  by  facilitating  appropriately  structured \nconcessions  and  inviting  private  sector  participation,  PPPs  can  help  strengthen  SOE \nperformance and reduce the burden on public finances over the long term. PPPs are also a \nmeans  for  the  government  to  attract  more  private  sector  investment  and  skills  into  SOE \noperations. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2006.

The government approved the sale of the Agricultural \nStore Corporation in December 2015; and the sale and purchase agreement was signed in April \n2016, and subsequently executed. In 2015 the government approved the Privatization and/or \nDivestment Policy following a policy review with ADB support. The review found the government \npolicy on SOEs to be broadly appropriate, but noted that there should be no differentiation \nbetween  strategic  and  nonstrategic  assets  when  considering  divestment,  nor  should \ncommercially operating trading bodies be owned by the government. \n \n18.  Subprogram 2 will support the establishment of a solid waste management PPP, which \naims to (i) improve service provision, through improvements to infrastructure and compliance \nwith international best practice relating to transportation, treatment, and disposal; (ii) ensure \nsolid waste management services are provided to all waste generators in Samoa, including \ncommercial and industrial premises; (iii) facilitate new private sector investment into the sector; \nand (iv) introduce the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle to achieve full cost recovery and ensure no \nreliance  on  public sector funding  in the  long term.  Subprogram  2  also  intends  to  support \ncompletion of external audits of SOEs in FY2016. \n \n19.  Output 2: Improved procurement systems. Strengthening of procurement systems is \nimportant in improving value-for-money in public expenditure and enhancing public service \ndelivery. Samoa has made substantial progress in reforming public procurement systems during \n2008\u20132015, and has built the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) procurement division. \nThe division has spearheaded reform of the legal and regulatory framework for procurement; \nthe government-approved procurement framework is the basis for instructions, guidelines, and \nstandard  tender  templates  for  minor  works,  minor  goods  and  related  services,  and  minor \ngeneral services. Subprogram 1 has supported the issuance of standard tender templates for \nmajor works. \n \n20.  Framework agreements enhance value-for-money in procurement by pooling of similar \nsmall  contracts  over  time  within  and  across  multiple  government  agencies.  Framework \nagreements will enable faster procurement (e.g., of medical or building supplies) in emergency \nsituations.  Pooled  procurement  increases  efficiency  through  economies  of  scale,  and  by \ndecreasing the number of different tenders and subsequent workload, leading to considerably \nlower expenses for suppliers and consumers. Further efficiency gains can be expected by \nprequalification of suppliers and products, introducing framework agreements with call-off orders, \nand by tendering required items separately, instead collating them into small lots as is now done. \nThis will promote greater competitiveness among suppliers, resulting in lower prices. \n \n21.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  included  provisions  in  its  Treasury \nInstructions (Part K) that provide a legal basis for the use of the framework agreement method. \nTo assist the line ministries and SOEs with implementation, the financial secretary subsequently \nissued the Guidelines on Framework Arrangement. Subject to that document and the amended \nTreasury  Instructions,  the  government\u2019s  Tenders  Board  has  revised  its  Guidelines  for \nGovernment Procurement and Contracting: Goods, Works and General Services. This allows \n ", "7 \nthe implementation of the framework arrangement method. To ensure the implementation of \nthese reforms, subprogram 2 will support the pilot procurement of pharmaceutical items using \nframework arrangements. It is also intended that subprogram 2 will support the establishment of \na complaints mechanism to further enhance the procurement system. \n \n22.  Output  3:  Improved  debt  management.  Strengthening  debt  policy  and  debt \nmanagement remains a key priority, given rapid increases in debt stock during FY2009 and \nFY2015.  The  government  has  produced  two  medium-term  debt  management  strategies \n(MTDSs) (in 2010 and 2013) and included debt statistics in its official statistical releases for \ngovernment finances. In 2014, the government established formal procedures for contracting \nloans and issuing government guarantees, which were designed to ensure that all loan and \nguarantee proposals go through the same channels, are subject to the same level of scrutiny, \nand are assessed against the same criteria. This was intended to reduce the chances of loans \nor guarantees being agreed without adequate scrutiny and without complying with the MTDS. \nHowever, there were subsequent increases in non\u2013concessional borrowing. \n \n23.  In November 2014, a bilateral loan agreement for CNY340 million (approximately $55 \nmillion, or about 6.6% of 2014 GDP) was signed to fund the upgrade of the airport terminal at \nFaleolo International Airport. The terms of the loan implied a grant element of about 25%, below \nthe  35%  threshold  used  for  assessing  concessionality.  Moreover,  implementation  of  the \nprocedures for contracting loans occurred only after the loan was signed, and an economic \nanalysis to assess whether the project would show a net economic benefit (as required to \nestablish  compliance  with  the  MTDS)  was  prepared  with  a  delay.  To  maintain  focus  and \ncompliance  with  approved  policies,  a  policy  action  for  an  updated  MTDS  following  an \nassessment  of  the  previous  MTDS  has  been  completed  under  subprogram  1.  A  project \neconomic  analysis  training  has  been  delivered  by  ADB  in  September  2016  to  assist  the \ngovernment  with  its  capacity  building.  An  external  debt management performance  audit  is \nintended as a policy action under subprogram 2. \n \n24.  Output 4: Resilience to climate change and variability promoted. Climate change \nand variability have the potential to have immediate and long-lasting implications on fiscal \nresources.  Possible  economic  implications  on  output  and  productivity  in  climate-sensitive \nsectors such as agriculture and tourism require fiscal responses, particularly following climate-\nrelated disasters. Disasters also affect sensitive coastal areas and stress health and education \nsystems and economic infrastructure. Disruptions to financial systems and trade also impact \nfiscal resources. Mainstreaming climate resilience in public investments has the potential to \nfacilitate decisions that may reduce long-term fiscal risks and contingent public liabilities. ADB \nhas,  in  the  Public  Sector  Financial  Management  Program  (footnote  9),  supported  the \ndevelopment  of  the  Apia  Town  Spatial  Plan  that  incorporates  climate  change  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  spatial  plan  has  since  been  approved  by  the  government  and  new \ndevelopments have been approved according to the plan. \n \n25.  The need to monitor and coordinate a large number of policies and projects associated \nwith building resilience to climate change is now important. Subprogram 1 has supported (i) the \nestablishment of a national monitoring and reporting framework for climate change; and (ii) the \ninclusion of climate risk and resilience indicators in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa, \n2016\u20132020, which is due for finalization in the latter part of 2016. Subprogram 2 will support an \nintegrated  policy  framework  that  allocates  responsibilities  for  resilience  across  government \nagencies; informs decisions to increase resilience across key sectors that include agriculture, \nforestry, water, and coastal and urban areas; and will be gender-responsive. It will also support \nthe development of a strategic investment plan that identifies key national infrastructure and \n ", "8 \nprioritizes risk-reduction interventions, thereby providing a basis for more coordinated climate \nresilience financing. The policy matrix for subprogram 1 is in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n26.  The government has requested a grant of $5.0 million from the Asian Development Fund \nresources for subprogram 1. The grant size (equivalent to 0.6% of FY2017 GDP estimate) is \nbased on the estimates of budget financing requirements and the availability of resources for \nSamoa. Samoa is in need of external assistance to meet resource requirements for budget \nfinancing,  given  that  economic  recovery  has  been  relatively  weak  following  the  negative \neconomic impact of Tropical Cyclone Evan, and that fiscal consolidation needs to be paced so \nas to not adversely affect growth. The program will be an integral part of a joint undertaking with \nother development partners to provide policy\u2013based support, monitored through the JPAM. The \ntotal value of grants from Samoa\u2019s development partners independent policy\u2013based operations \nare equivalent to 1.8% of GDP in FY2017 and FY2018. Without these grants, the expected \nfiscal deficit in FY2017 would be equivalent to 5.3% of GDP, and likely a similar level in FY2018, \nthus contributing to an increase in public debt; if the government were to maintain its fiscal \ndeficit  target,  expenditure  levels  would  need  to  be  reduced  and  public  services  could  be \ncompromised. The FY2017 projected deficit will be financed by concessional loans for the \nAgriculture Sector Support Program (World Bank), the Power Sector Expansion Project (ADB), \nthe Petroleum Bulk Storage Facility (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), and \nthe Faleolo International Airport Terminal (China EXIM Bank). \n \n27.  The proposed ADB and parallel collaborative partner financing (not administered by \nADB) are indicated in Table 2. The grant will be released as a single tranche of $5.0 million \nupon grant effectiveness and in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, \nas amended time to time). The government will ensure that the local currency funds generated \nby the grant will be used to (i) meet its financing requirements, and (ii) provide the necessary \nimpetus for sustained action on critical agreed reforms. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total \nSource  Subprogram 1  Subprogram 2  (%) \nAsian Development Bank        \nAsian Development Fund (grant)  5.0  0.0  11.6 \nAsian Development Fund (loan)  0.0  5.0  11.6 \nWorld Bank  5.0  5.0  23.3 \nAustralia  2.3  2.3  10.7 \nNew Zealand  2.5  2.1  10.7 \nEuropean Union  6.1  7.7  32.1 \nTotal  20.9  22.1  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  The MOF will be the executing agency, and will oversee and coordinate the timely \nimplementation  of  agreed  policy  actions.  The  MOF  will  also  be  responsible  for  program \nadministration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. The MOF and the MPE \nwill be the implementing agencies for the program. The MPE will implement SOE reform outputs, \nwhile the MOF will implement the remaining outputs under the program. The government, ADB, \nand other development partners will participate in at least one annual review of the program by \nJune  2017.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  indicates  the  program \nframework, including the indicative policy actions for subprogram 1. The policy matrix (Appendix \n ", "9 \n4) indicates the policy actions that have been completed for subprogram 1. The JPAM process \nfacilitates broad consultations on reform priorities. Individual reform initiatives form part of the \ngovernment\u2019s existing reform priorities and are being discussed with the private sector and civil \nsociety groups during program preparation and implementation. The program implementation \nperiod is January 2016 to March 2018. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is from \nJanuary 2016 to March 2017, and for subprogram 2 from April 2017 to March 2018. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  The  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  Samoa\u2019s  improved  fiscal \nmanagement  and  stability,  which  will  in  turn  help  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  in  the \ncountry and sustain growth. Strengthened public sector management and better-performing \nSOEs will also allow for improved service delivery, which is essential to make growth inclusive \nand to foster employment and poverty reduction. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The  reforms  supported  under  the  program  envisage  macroeconomic  stability  and \nimproved fiscal resilience, which will reduce the negative impacts of external shocks, including \non growth and service delivery. SOE reforms are expected to positively impact private sector \ndevelopment and job creation, while reducing the drain on fiscal resources from ineffective and \ninefficient public enterprises. Improved public procurement systems and debt management will \ncontribute to building fiscal resilience through reductions in the government\u2019s operating costs. \nMainstreaming climate change in public investments will contribute to reduced post-disaster \ncosts in the long term. Costs for policy reforms supported under the JPAM are not estimated, \nand their impacts are not quantified because of data and capacity constraints. \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  Promoting good governance is a priority for the government, which is implementing \nphase 3 of its PFM reform plan (footnote 5), following considerable progress under the earlier \nphases. The government prepared phase 3 based on the weaknesses highlighted in the most \nrecent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment, carried out in 2013.12 The \nplan  also  accounted  for  outstanding  reforms  from  phase  2,  and  actions  identified  during \nconsultations within the government and with development partners through the JPAM process. \nA high level of ownership for the reforms is evident, and a strong monitoring and evaluation \nsystem now in place. The ADB Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  A stable macroeconomic position and existence of fiscal buffers will reduce the impact of \nexternal  shocks  and  allow  the  government  to  appropriately  respond  to  immediate  needs \nfollowing disasters, while maintaining basic social services. An efficient PFM has a positive \nimpact on service delivery. Private sector development creates employment, which is critical for \naddressing poverty. Subprogram 1 is classified as having no gender elements, with better PFM \nand employment-creation function under the program bringing no specific benefits to women. \n \n                                                \n12 PEFA. Samoa 2014. https://pefa.org/sites/default/files/assements/comments/WS-Dec14-PFMPR-Public.pdf \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is \nclassified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nactivities  under  the  program  will  support  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  none  of  the \nactivities will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, or affect indigenous peoples or the \nenvironment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 PFM systems are assessed as sound and \nable to reasonably support the implementation of the government\u2019s fiscal policies and delivery of \nservices. Integrated benefits and impacts of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCommitment to sound macroeconomic  Continuous policy dialogue with the government and \nmanagement and fiscal management weakens  partners to develop joint expectations and \ncommitments \nHigh staff turnover diminishes reform  Technical assistance can be provided on a needs \nimplementation capacity  basis to supplement capacity \nDelays in technical assistance delivery to  Regular coordination discussions among \nimplement reforms  development partners to identify and bridge gaps \nExternal shocks undermine implementation of  Continuous strengthening of the fiscal position to \nreforms and achievement of program goals  rebuild buffers; additional assistance in case of \nshocks \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based grant would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the \nabsence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of \nADB, I recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Fiscal Resilience Improvement Program, and \n(ii)  the grant of $5,000,000 to the Independent State of Samoa for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Fiscal  Resilience  Improvement  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n10 November 2016 \n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is Aligned With \nMacroeconomic stability is maintained over the medium term (Strategy for the Development of Samoa, \n2012\u20132016)a \n \nData Sources and   \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Reporting   \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  The Program     \nFiscal resilience  Current expenditure remains below  Budget estimates  Commitment to sound \nimproved  29.0% of GDP in FY2017 and  IMF reports  macroeconomic \nFY2018 budgets (Baseline: FY2016    management and fiscal \nbudgeted current expenditure of    management weakens. \n29.1% of GDP).     \n   \nSubprogram 1   \nGovernment targets fiscal deficit at or  Budget estimates \nbelow 3.5% of GDP for FY2017  IMF reports \n(Baseline: FY2016 deficit of 0.4% of   \nGDP).   \n   \nSubprogram 2   \nGovernment maintains its fiscal  Budget estimates \ndeficit target at or below 3.5% of  IMF reports \nGDP for FY2018. \nOutputs  The Program     \n1.
