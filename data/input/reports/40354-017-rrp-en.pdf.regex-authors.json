THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Health Human Resources Development \nProject.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Second Health Human Resources Development \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The  project  will  assist  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  in  achieving  universal  health \ncoverage (UHC), including access to essential health care services, by increasing the supply of \na skilled health workforce.2 It builds on the achievements of the Health Human Resources \nSector Development Program by expanding and improving the quality of undergraduate health \nprofessional  training  programs.  Specifically,  the  project  will  design  and  operationalize  new \ncampuses in Hanoi Medical University (HMU) and the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at \nHo Chi Minh City (UMP).3 It will feature climate-resilient teaching and ancillary infrastructure, \nhelping the universities to increase undergraduate enrolment and teaching capacity. The project \nwill complement the proposed Local Health Care for Disadvantaged Areas Sector Development \nProgram  through  innovative  models  of  engaging teaching  institutions  in  community  health, \nincluding the application of information technology-based learning.4 This will enhance the quality \nof health care in rural and underserved areas in response to the population\u2019s evolving health \nneeds.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n  \n3.  Development  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  has  bolstered  the \ncountry\u2019s progress in reducing poverty. Gross domestic product grew by an average of 6.5% per \nyear from 1991 to 2017. Gross domestic product per capita reached $2,389 in 2017. The \npoverty rate (i.e., the share of the population living on less than $1.90 per day in purchasing \npower parity) fell from 52.9% in 1992 to 2.0% in 2016, while the Gini coefficient decreased \nslightly from 35.7 to 35.3 over the same period.5 However, poverty incidence varies significantly \nacross regions. Ethnic minorities, who account for 14.5% of the population, make up more than \nhalf of the poor.6 The government has recognized that inclusive growth and public health are \nintricately linked, as shown by disparities in the key health indicators by region. For example, in \nthe impoverished Central Highlands, the infant mortality rate was 24.8 per 1,000 live births in \n2015, while in the affluent South East region it was 8.6 per 1,000 live births. Similar variations \n                                                \n1  The proposed project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet \nNam, 2018\u20132020.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nare also found in reproductive health and maternal mortality outcomes.7 Disparities in health \noutcomes perpetuate socio-economic disadvantage.8 Inclusive growth is further threatened by \nthe growing financial burden associated with the treatment of noncommunicable diseases.9 In \n2015, the proportion of the total disease burden attributable to noncommunicable diseases \nreached 73%,10 partly because of Viet Nam\u2019s aging population (footnote 7). Improving access to \nquality health services, particularly in poorer rural areas, will have a positive impact on health \noutcomes. \n \n4.  Insufficient number of health professionals. The insufficient number of skilled health \ncare professionals hampers efforts to achieve UHC. An estimated additional 43,250 doctors, \n249,416 nurses, and 22,199 pharmacists are required by 2030 to meet the country\u2019s health \nworkforce coverage targets. Viet Nam\u2019s health education and professional training institutions \n(HEPTI) produce an insufficient number of professionals to meet these targets. While demand \nfor admission to HEPTI is strong, inadequate infrastructure restricts the capacity of universities \nto increase enrolments. This is most evident at HMU and UMP, Viet Nam\u2019s leading HEPTI. In \n2017, only 7%\u20138% of the total applicants for undergraduate medicine at each university could \nbe offered places.  \n \n5.  Deficiencies in skills. Deficiencies in skills compound the adverse effects of the health \nworkforce shortage, particularly in local health care (LHC).11 Medical doctors have inadequate \nknowledge of clinical guidelines. They ask patients, on average, less than 50% of the required \nquestions about their medical history and conduct less than 60% of the physical examinations \nspecified in clinical guidelines. Knowledge of case management protocols is also inadequate, \nwith many doctors prescribing unnecessary and harmful treatments. Half of the medical doctors \nworking in the poorest areas fall in the bottom two quintiles of the national ability scale. These \ndeficiencies  result  in  poor  treatment  quality,  low  service  use,  and  poor  health  outcomes, \nparticularly in disadvantaged areas.12 \n \n6.  Teaching programs are poorly aligned with population health needs. The Ministry \nof Health (MOH) has issued competency standards for general medical practitioners.13 However, \nHEPTI  have  been  slow  to  operationalize  these  through  their  curriculum.  HEPTI  require \nassistance to transition the health professional training programs from a knowledge-based to \ncompetency-based  curriculum.14 This  requires  introducing  faculty  development  programs  to \ntrain educators in interactive teaching methods and clinical skills teaching. Further, limited \nopportunities for students to undertake practice in poor and vulnerable communities should be \naddressed as this leaves graduates ill-equipped to work with underserved populations.15  \n                                                \n7  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Health (MOH). 2017.

Uneven distribution of the health workforce. Distribution of the health workforce is \nskewed,  with  remote  and  mountainous  areas  underserviced.  For  example,  the  Central \nHighlands has 43 health workers per 10,000 people, while the Red River Delta region has 71 \nhealth workers per 10,000 people.16 The proportion of commune health stations (CHSs) served \nby a doctor and a midwife or assistant doctor17 is lowest in the Central Highlands and Northern \nMidlands and Mountain regions (footnote 7). Higher health workforce density is statistically \nassociated with lower infant mortality, and longer life expectancy.18   \n \n8.  Limited  professional development  opportunities in  remote  areas. A 2015 study \nfound that only 50% of doctors working in district hospitals received some form of training in the \nprevious 12 months. Among the CHS staff, the proportion who received any training ranged \nfrom 58% to 81%, depending on the province (footnote 14). For health care workers who \nchoose to serve in remote areas, access to professional development is limited. Innovative \ndistance-learning  technologies  can  improve  such  access.  HMU  and  UMP  are  licensed \ncontinuing medical education (CME) providers, but lack access to these new technologies. 19 \n \n9.  Government\u2019s plan and strategy. The National Action Plan for the Implementation of \nthe 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda confirms the government\u2019s commitment to ensure \nan  adequate  supply  of  skilled  health  workforce  toward  achieving  UHC.20 The  government \nprioritizes the development of health human resources (HHR).21 The MOH will transition HMU \nand UMP into health sciences universities, capable of increasing graduate numbers across \ndisciplines, in line with the country\u2019s evolving health needs. The MOH has undertaken reforms \nto redress deficiencies in LHC workforce quantity and quality, rapidly increase the number of \ngraduates, and improve training quality.22 It will also redress the imbalance in HHR distribution, \nprioritizing  the  LHC  level.23 Various  MOH  programs,  including  the  deployment  of  graduate \ndoctors to difficult areas and granting students from disadvantaged locations preferential access \nto HEPTI, have contributed to increasing the health workforce in LHC facilities.24  \n \n10.  The medium-term development plans of HMU and UMP detail the increase in student \nintake required to meet health workforce needs.25 The MOH has prepared health sciences \nfacility master plans for HMU and UMP and has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n                                                \n16 World Health Organization. 2016.

Each  university  will  recruit  additional \nacademic staff to ensure undergraduate teaching commences once civil works are completed. \nSubsequent  phases  incorporate  the  development  of  graduate  and  postgraduate  training \nfacilities, research institutes, teaching hospitals, and medical technology centers. \n \n11.  ADB  sector  experience  and  strategy.  ADB\u2019s engagement with Viet Nam\u2019s health \nsector has focused on improving the population\u2019s access to quality health services. During \n1995\u20132005, ADB improved primary health and hospital facilities, service delivery, and the health \nworkforce  in  rural  and  mountainous  provinces.26 During  2006\u20132016,  it  invested  in  health \nservices in remote areas,27 communicable disease control, and health security.28 The Health \nHuman  Resources  Sector  Development  Program  supported  sector-wide  reforms  in  health \nprofessional  education  and  health  staff  management,  and  strengthened  infrastructure  and \nteaching capacity in 17 HEPTI, including HMU and UMP (footnote 3). ADB\u2019s health sector \nstrategy supports government efforts toward achieving UHC\u2014use of health services, quality of \nhealth care, and health financial risk protection. It pursues coordinated interventions that focus \non (i) reforms to strengthen the LHC system (footnote 4); (ii) strengthening health care service \ndelivery in selected areas (footnote 27); (iii) developing HHR (footnote 3); (iv) improving health \nsecurity, including its regional dimensions (footnote 28); and (v) enhancing health financing \nthrough social health insurance.29 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).30  \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Project \n1. Addressing remaining  Achieving better health for all  \npoverty and reducing  (i)  Pursuing universal health coverage and improving access to quality health \ninequalities    services by addressing undersupply of skilled health professionals at LHC \nfacilities. \n(ii)  Promoting the use of innovative distance training technologies to enhance the \nquality of LHC workforce in remote areas.  \n2.

Lessons. The Health Human Resources Sector Development Program demonstrated \nthat  for  developing  a  sustainable  high-quality  health  workforce,  strengthening  of  HHR \ninstitutions and systems, and expansion of HEPTI infrastructure are both required (footnote 3). \nTertiary education projects with infrastructure components require strong country ownership, \ndesign clarity, and an experienced executing agency. Incorporating these lessons, the project \naligns  with  the  national  HHR  development  strategy  (footnote  22)  and  the  universities\u2019 \ndevelopment plans (footnote 25). The health minister has already approved the master plans \nand basic architectural designs of both campuses, which will expedite project implementation \nwhile providing the required design clarity. The executing agency is experienced, having a \nproven record of implementing large infrastructure projects.  \n \n13.   ADB value addition. ADB synergizes individual health sector investments to maximize \ncumulative impacts toward UHC. The proposed Local Health Care for Disadvantaged Areas \nSector Development Program complements the project by strengthening LHC public investment \nmanagement,  improving  the  LHC  service  delivery  model,  and  enhancing  health  workforce \ndevelopment  and  management.  The  project  will  increase  the  supply  of  health  staff  with \nnecessary  skills  to  provide  care  at  LHC  level.  Current  technical  assistance  also  supports \nstrengthening of the regulatory and institutional framework to ensure equitable access to and \naccountability of health financing (footnote 29). Based on past and ongoing ADB technical \nassistance,  the  project  design  incorporates  climate-resilient  building  and  features  IT-based \ndistance learning.31 This consolidates ADB\u2019s value addition as a provider of knowledge and \ninnovative technology solutions. \n \n14.   Development coordination. To sustain HHR improvements, a systematic and sector-\nwide  approach  is  required  covering  training,  accreditation  and  standards,  and  residency \nprograms for new doctors and nurses. ADB focuses on improving HHR training infrastructure, \ntraining program quality, and HHR management to increase the number, quality and allocation \nof health care practitioners. The World Health Organization is helping to introduce minimum \nqualification criteria for newly graduated health professionals, including a national licensing \nexam and a national medical council. Several development partners, including the World Bank \nand the Partnership for Health Advancement in Viet Nam, are updating curricula for medical \neducation  at  both  the  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  level.  The  Partnership  for  Health \nAdvancement  in  Viet  Nam  has  developed  a  3-year  hospital-based  postgraduate  surgical \nresidency  training  program.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  supporting  the \ndevelopment and pilot testing of a standardized clinical training program for nursing graduates.32 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: UHC, including access to essential \nhealth care services, achieved. The project will have the following outcome: supply of skilled \nhealth workforce increased.33  \n                                                \n31 ADB.

Output 1: Undergraduate education facilities in the new Hanoi Medical University \nand University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City campuses operationalized. \nThe project will support phase 1 of the HMU and UMP health sciences facility master plans by \nestablishing undergraduate teaching at each newly completed campus. Upper-class, graduate, \nand  doctorate  students  will  remain  at  the  existing  campuses.  The  project  will  deliver  (i) a \ndetailed engineering design for phase 1 covering undergraduate facilities and infrastructure, \nwhich incorporates gender-specific design features and complies with international greenhouse \nand urban climate change resilience standards; (ii) site preparation and construction of phase 1 \nfacilities; and (iii) classroom and laboratory equipment. At project completion, HMU and UMP\u2019s \ncombined annual intake of undergraduate students will increase by 2,200, contributing 1,863 \nadditional health professionals to the workforce annually by 2032. \n \n17.  Output  2:  Competency  of  graduates  to  respond  to  community  health  needs \nstrengthened. The project will (i) conduct assessments of the health needs of women and men \nin the 35 disadvantaged rural and urban communes; (ii) update the curriculum for four key \ndegree programs, focusing on competencies for work at the LHC level;34 (iii) rotate 700 students \nunder a pilot model of practice placements at CHSs servicing poor populations; (iv) equip 35 \nCHSs in pilot sites;35 and (v) strengthen faculty capacity in interactive teaching methods and \nclinical skills teaching. \n \n18.  Output 3: Quality of health workforce in disadvantaged communities enhanced. \nThe project will (i) equip health facilities in four remote districts to support the CME pilot project, \n(ii) develop 40 CME modules covering primary health care topics including modules specific to \nthe health needs of women,36 (iii) pilot test the delivery of distance CME for the health workforce \nin four districts and evaluate the efficacy of the approach, and (iv) apply pilot testing evidence to \ninform replication by HEPTI and registered CME providers.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $98.8 million (Table 2). The government has requested \na concessional loan of $80.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of  \n2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and grant agreements. The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will \nfinance the expenditures for civil works, equipment, and consulting services. The Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $3.0 million. This includes \ntaxes and duties of $0.2 million. The grant will finance activities under Outputs 2 and 3. The \ngovernment\u2019s  contribution  of  $15.8 million  includes taxes, consulting  services, resettlement \ncosts,  financing  charges  during  implementation,  and  in-kind  contributions.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The MOH is the executing agency for the project. HMU and UMP are the implementing \nagencies. A project coordination unit and three project implementing units will be established to \nmanage the loan and the grant. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 37). Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time) will be applied for the project. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \n  Loan  Grant \nImplementation period  April 2019\u2013June 2025  April 2019\u2013March 2023 \nEstimated completion date   30 June 2025  31 March 2023 \nEstimated closing date  31 December 2025  30 September 2023 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project Steering Committee: Health minister (chair); Ministry of Education, MOH \nDepartment of Planning and Finance, presidents of HMU and UMP (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  MOH  \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  UMP and HMU  \n(iv)  Implementation units  PCU, 1 Project Director, 2 Deputy Project Directors;  PIU HMU, 4 staff and 3 \nconsultants; PIU UMP, 4 staff and 3 consultants \nProcurement     Loan  Grant \n  Contracts  ($ million)  Contracts  ($ million) \nOCB for works  4  65.0  NA  NA \nOCB for goods  3  3.78  4  0.72 \n ", "8 \nRFQ  1  0.10  8  0.32 \nConsulting services  OCB-QCBS  3  4.34  2  0.24 \nOCB-LCS  5  0.20  NA   NA \nICS  0  0  6  0.52 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance actions include finalizing terms of reference for consultants; \nadvance contracting  advertising recruitment requests and proposal and/or bid evaluations. \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HMU = Hanoi Medical University, ICS = individual consultants selection, LCS = \nleast-cost selection, MOH = Ministry of Health, NA = not applicable, OCB = open competitive bidding, PCU = project \ncoordinating unit, PIU = project implementing unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, RFQ = request for \nquotation, UMP = University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The master plans considered topography, natural characteristics, and climate conditions. \nClimate  change  adaptation  measures  include  resilient  building  designs,  proper  drainage \nsystems,  and  adequate  elevation  of  structures.  Climate  change  mitigation features  include \ngreen building architectural designs; positioning allowing natural lighting and airflow; use of \nelectricity-saving bulbs and equipment; waste management; and solar energy-operated utilities. \nThe grant will provide clinical equipment for LHC facilities that is appropriate to users\u2019 capacity \nand the community\u2019s health care needs; and user-friendly interfaces for distance learning CME.    \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n22.  The project\u2019s net present value is projected at $2.2 billion over a 35-year period. The \neconomic internal rate of return is forecast at 19.2%, exceeding the threshold for social sector \nprojects.38 The economic benefits derive from (i) direct labor productivity gains from the entry of \nadditional medical professionals into the labor force, and (ii) indirect labor productivity gains \nfrom a reduction in illness and premature death due to an increase in health professionals per \ncapita. Each university will finance the operation and maintenance of their new campuses \nthrough revenue generated from tuition, external training, and hospital services. Tuition revenue \nwill increase from 2025 because of higher enrolments and tuition fees.39 The increase in net \noperating cash flow of the two universities is projected to cover operation and maintenance.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk of the project is high because of unclear \naccounting  guidelines  specific  to  this  project,  and  weak  internal  controls  through  a  fully \nintegrated system within the executing agency. Procurement risks for the loan component are \nhigh, while the procurement risk for the grant is moderate. The MOH has extensive experience \nof implementing large civil works projects and the engineering capacity required to oversee the \ndetailed engineering design and campus construction funded by the government. HMU and \nUMP have experience managing and implementing assistance-funded projects, including the \nHealth Human Resources Sector Development Program. HMU and UMP will supplement their \ntechnical capacity to execute the teaching program reforms and implement the project\u2019s pilot \n                                                \n38 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Under the government\u2019s policy on university autonomy, HMU and UMP will set their own tuition fees from 2025. \n ", "9 \ninitiatives  using  international  and  national  consultants.  The  project  will  establish  a  project \ncoordinating unit and three project implementation units and will build their capacity on ADB \nproject administration guidelines and reporting requirements. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was discussed with the government and MOH.   \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n24.  The project will address health inequities that drive socioeconomic imbalances. It will \nincrease the supply of a skilled health workforce responsive to the needs of disadvantaged \ngroups. It will create job opportunities for poor people in the project area during construction. It \nis categorized effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has been prepared.40 It \nwill address gender inequality by (i) incorporating gender-responsive physical design features in \nnew  campuses,  (ii)  supplying  LHC  facilities  with  equipment  for  health  conditions  affecting \nwomen, (iii) ensuring gender-equitable participation in student placements and CME, and (iv) \nensuring at least 10% of CME modules are specific to women\u2019s health issues.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.41  \n \n26.   Environment  (category  B).  The  MOH  prepared  initial  environmental  examination \nreports for the HMU and UMP sites, which include environmental management plans.42 Both \nsites are outside sensitive areas. The project will avoid or mitigate adverse environmental \nimpacts through measures in the environmental management plans. The MOH conducted public \nconsultations  that  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  ADB  disclosed  the  initial \nenvironmental examination reports on its website. A consultant will support HMU and UMP to \nensure compliance with environmental safeguards. Environmental reporting to ADB will be \nsemiannual.  \n \n27.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  requires  land  for  construction \nunder phase 1 of each campus master plan. HMU\u2019s campus has 125 affected households, of \nwhich 31 (121 people) are severely affected.43 UMP\u2019s campus has 25 affected households, of \nwhich eight are severely affected (33 people).44 ADB disclosed project information to affected \nhouseholds  throughout  project  preparation  and  distributed  a  project  information  booklet.  It \nprepared resettlement plans for each campus in consultation with local communities and posted \nthem on the ADB website. It will update and disclose the resettlement plans after preparing the \ndetailed engineering design and receiving ADB clearance before awarding of contracts.  \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not affect ethnic minorities. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n29.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \n                                                \n40 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n41 ADB.
