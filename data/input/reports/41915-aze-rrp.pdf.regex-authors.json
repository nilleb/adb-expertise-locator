I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed  \n(i) senior secured loan of up to $4 million, and (ii) senior secured loan of up to $2 million \nequivalent in Azerbaijan new manats (AZN), to the Bank of Baku (BOB). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Azerbaijan Economy: Overview and Outlook \n2.  The rapid increase in oil production resulted in Azerbaijan\u2019s economy posting its fifth \nconsecutive year of double-digit growth in 2006. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a \nrecord 34.5% in real terms, the world\u2019s highest growth rate for the second year running. By far, \nthe greatest engine of growth has been the industrial sector, in which value added was up by \njust over 56%, bringing cumulative growth in 2005\u20132006 to almost 150%. Within the industry \nsector, it is the oil and gas sector that is driving the growth. The non-oil economy is still growing \nstrongly, expanding by 11.2% in 2006, but its contribution to GDP is falling as the oil economy \nexpands. Non-oil sectors provided 47% of nominal GDP in 2006, down from 58% a year earlier \nand 61% in 2004. \n \n3.  The medium-term outlook for the economy of Azerbaijan is positive. GDP growth is \nexpected to continue posting high double-digit growth over the next few years, mainly from \nincreased oil and gas production and exports. Foreign investment is expected to decline over \ntime  as  the  major  oil  and  gas  projects  move  toward  less  intensive  stages.  However,  the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan expects increased domestic public investment to offset some of this \ndecline. Government expenditure rose by over 80% in 2006 and is projected to rise by a further \n50% in 2007, which puts considerable pressure on inflation.1 With the substantial increase in oil \nand  gas  revenues,  and  as  imports  are  expected  to  ease,  the  current  account  surplus  is \nexpected to consolidate further. \n \n4.  In the long term, Azerbaijan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat to \nthe economy given the potential volatility in the international oil market. The main challenge for \nAzerbaijan is to develop the non-oil sector to ensure that the economy continues to grow on a \nsustainable path after the oil boom, meeting both short-term expectations and longer-term \ndemands. A key objective is to develop income-generating and new employment opportunities \nin the non-oil sector, in such priority areas as banking and finance, trade, and small and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) development.  \n \n5.  In February 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded Azerbaijan's foreign and local currency issuer \ndefault ratings to BB+ from BB. Fitch noted that the country\u2019s outlooks remain stable. Fitch\u2019s \nupgrade  of  Azerbaijan's  sovereign  ratings  is  justified  by  strong  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth, low government and external debt ratios, and a growing current account surplus\u2014\nunderpinned by rapidly rising oil and gas production. In September 2006, Moody's assigned a \nforeign and local currency issuer rating of Ba1 to Azerbaijan. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB projects 14% inflation in 2007. Source: ADB. 2007. Azerbaijan Country Chapter in Asian Development \nOutlook. Manila.  \n ", "2      \nB.  Banking Sector in Azerbaijan  \n6.  Despite tremendous economic development, Azerbaijan's banking sector is one of the \nweakest among the sovereigns rated by Fitch.2 The depth of bank intermediation activity is low \n(system assets were equivalent to only 17% of GDP as of the end of 2006). The provision of \nfinancial services to households and the private sector is very limited\u2014only an estimated 10% \nof the total population has bank accounts, reflecting low confidence in the banking sector. \nFinancial services have mainly been provided to the oil, construction, and trade sectors\u2014\nleaving the retail and SME sectors notably underserved. \n \n7.  Banking sector deposits have grown rapidly but remain low, and are not commensurate \nwith Azerbaijan\u2019s level of development. According to the National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA), \ndeposits  rose  by  50%  in  2006  to  AZN2.0  billion,  an  estimated  11%  of  GDP.  Although \ndollarization continues to persist in the banking sector, the share of deposits held in AZN has \nincreased notably over the past year, at least in part because of the appreciation of the local \ncurrency against the US dollar. By November 2006, 37% of total deposits were held in AZN, up \nfrom just 20% at the end of 2005. \n \n8.  Azerbaijan\u2019s commercial banks have used the rapidly growing deposit base to expand \ntheir  loan  portfolios\u2014an  important  and  positive  development  given  the  marginal  financial \nintermediation role that they have played in the economy to date. As of December 2006, \nconsolidated  lending  by  banks  was  AZN2.36  billion,  up  64%  from  the  previous  year.  By \nApril 2007, consolidated lending by banks reached AZN2.87 billion. However, despite the large \nincrease in the deposit base, it is still too small to meet the growing demand for financial \nservices, especially from SMEs.  \n \n9.  The private and state-owned commercial banks each provide about 48% of total loans \noutstanding,  with  the  remainder  coming  from  non-bank  institutions.  However,  most  private \nbanks focus exclusively on lending to the private sector, primarily individual entrepreneurs and \nSMEs. Because of their small size and customer focus, the banks provide mainly small and \nmicro loans and typically do not serve the oil and gas sector. \n \n10.  A particular concern in the banking system is the ratio and quality of capitalization, \nparticularly as credit continues to grow rapidly. In response to this, the authorities have worked \nto improve the supervision of the banking system. Minimum capital requirements will be raised \nfrom AZN6.4 million to AZN10.0 million by July 2008, which is expected to translate into further \nconsolidation and mergers, resulting in fewer and better capitalized banks. This is a positive \nstep toward strengthening the financial system in Azerbaijan. Currently, only 10 of Azerbaijan\u2019s \n44 banks have AZN10.0 million in capital.   \n \n11.  Despite substantial support from multilateral and bilateral agencies, most private banks \nare expected to remain illiquid and undercapitalized in the medium term. State-owned banks will \ncontinue to dominate the sector. Together with continued strong economic growth, this will \nensure that the risk of a banking crisis is low. In February 2007, a presidential decree was \nenacted that called for the privatization of Kapital Bank. The privatization of one of two of the \ncountry\u2019s state-owned banks will be a welcome step in opening up the banking system to a \nmore competitive environment.  \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Fitch Ratings.

SMEs account for about 80% of registered private businesses operating in Azerbaijan, \nand represented an estimated 10% of GDP in the past 5 years. SMEs are the biggest source of \ndomestic employment outside of the public sector, providing livelihood for over three quarters of \nthe country\u2019s workforce. An estimated 70% of SMEs are located in Baku and the Absheron \nPeninsula, and have limited capacity for business and regional expansion, and new export \nopportunities.   \n \n13.  The importance of SMEs in relation to general economic vitality is widely acknowledged. \nStudies have shown that, in most countries, SMEs and the informal sector account for about \n45\u201375% of employment and 65\u201370% of GDP, regardless of the development stage of the \neconomy.3 The development of SMEs is therefore crucial to the development of the non-oil \nsector in Azerbaijan.    \n \n14.  One of the biggest hurdles facing SMEs in Azerbaijan today is the lack of access to \nfinance. This problem has been identified and recognized by both the Government and the \ndonor community as a key constraint to SME development, especially outside Baku. \n \n2.  Government Efforts \n15.  The Government continues to support SME growth and improved business environment. \nIn the past 2 years, the state policy has shifted from providing direct aid to SMEs to improving \nthe regulatory and business infrastructure to facilitate the development of the private sector. In \nconsultation with the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Team, the Government has identified a list \nof urgent measures and actions to simplify business regulations in the country.  \n \n16.  In 2005, the Government completed the 2-year state program for SME development. \nThe major objectives of the program were: (i) creation and development of legal and physical \ninfrastructures for efficient operation of SMEs; (ii) expansion of the foreign economic activity of \nSMEs and export promotion; and (iii) expansion of opportunities for financial and investment \nassistance for SMEs.  \n \n17.  To  help  alleviate  the  problem  of  lack  of  financing  faced  by  SMEs,  the  Azerbaijani \nGovernment established a special state budget fund for SME development, supervised by the \nMinistry of Economic Development. The fund is expected to disburse a total of $94 million in \n2007 for various SME projects via 25 private bank agents, 1 nonbank institution, and 5 credit \nunions. While the loan size varies from $50,000 to $1 million, the annual interest rate is limited \nto  7%  (market  rates  are  in  the  range  of  15\u201320%).  However,  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment recognizes that (i) the fund should not be a continuing source of subsidized \nfinancing for SMEs, and (ii) private banks have to look actively for external sources to reduce \nmarket lending rates. In mid-2007, the Ministry of Economic Development is expected to revise \nthe  fund\u2019s  charter  in  accordance  with  a  new  draft  of  the  second  state  program  on  SME \ndevelopment to be approved in early 2008 \n.  \n                                                 \n3  SMEs and Poverty Reduction, a Report for the Ford Foundation's Affinity Group on Development Finance (AGDF) \nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Committee by CFED, 2004.

Overview \n18.  BOB is a domestic commercial bank in Azerbaijan offering a wide spectrum of financial \nproducts and services to an estimated 67,000 retail clients and 1,770 corporate clients. It has \ntwo major lines of business\u2014retail and corporate banking (except asset management and \ninvestment banking services). It has a significant presence in the retail sector, which accounts \nfor about 60% of its business. It is also the third largest issuer of plastic cards in Azerbaijan.  \n \n19.  One of the first commercial banks in Azerbaijan, BOB was registered on 14 February \n1994 originally under the name of Tugay Bank. The key founder of BOB was the Turkish \ncompany Nab D\u0131\u015f Ticaret. On 10 February 1997, BOB\u2019s name was changed to Bank of Baku \nand it was reregistered as a joint stock commercial bank in August 1997. \n \n20.  BOB\u2019s client base began to grow beyond serving its corporate owners when, in May \n2001, it partnered with Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) to provide credit to SMEs under the \nGermany-Azerbaijan fund. To date, BOB is the largest participant in the program. In 2002, BOB \ndecided to broaden its focus on retail services, while further developing its SME products. \nEfforts to target the SME market received a further boost from a credit line with the European \nBank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in February 2004.   \n \n21.  In February 2005, BOB was merged with OJSC \u0130lkbank, making it one of the 10 largest \nbanks in the country.4 The merger was a consolidation of BOB\u2019s strength in retail banking and \n\u0130lkbank\u2019s strength in corporate banking. As of 31 March 2007, BOB had 287 full-time employees \nwith 207 staff at the branches.  \n \nIII.  PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n22.  Proposed assistance to BOB from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be in the form \nof: (i) a senior secured term loan of up to $4 million (ADB US dollar loan), and (ii) a senior \nsecured term loan of up to $2 million equivalent in local currency (ADB AZN loan).    \n \nB.  Main Terms and Conditions \n23.  The ADB US dollar loan will have a maturity of up to 5 years, with an amortizing \nrepayment structure.  \n \n24.  The ADB AZN loan will have a maturity of up to 2 years. ADB would buy local currency \nspot at financial close. To protect ADB from any foreign exchange downturn, the repayment of \nthe ADB AZN loan will be linked to the AZN/US dollar exchange rate and capital protected. The \ncoupon will have a built in AZN/US dollar swap, which will be structured and priced to allow ADB \nto participate in AZN upward movements.  \n \n25.  The ADB US dollar loan and ADB AZN loan, sourced from ordinary capital resources, will \ncarry  an  interest  rate  based  on  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  a  margin \ndetermined  by  ADB's  credit  enhancement  and  pricing  committee.  The  committee  will  also \ndetermine the up-front and commitment fees.  \n \n                                                 \n4 The share capital of the newly merged bank was formed in equal amounts by BOB and \u0130lkbank.   ", "    5 \n26.  Proceeds of the proposed loans will be used by BOB for onlending to SME clients in \nAzerbaijan.  The proposed loans will be secured by the rights and receivables under the sub-\nloans. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \nA.  Justification for ADB Investment \n1.  Development Outcome \n27.  The proposed ADB assistance will promote development at the following key levels: \n \n(i)  Increased access to finance for SMEs. SMEs play a significant role in all of \nADB\u2019s developing member country (DMC) economies and are key drivers of \nemployment, economic growth, and development. They often have a significant \nimpact on the GDP and in most cases grow faster than state-owned enterprises. \nThe development of SMEs is therefore an important engine of growth and a key \ncontributor to poverty reduction by creating employment, increasing individual \nincomes, and generating tax revenues. \n \nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations. \nHowever,  in  most  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  SMEs  have  difficulty  accessing  financial \nservices  and  securing  financing.  Although  bank  loans  are  dominating  any \nexternal financing (because of the underdeveloped corporate bond markets), \nonly a small number of SMEs in the region have access to bank lending (mostly \nonly  for  working  capital).  In  most  DMCs,  lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is \nconsidered the main financing difficulty and an obstacle for sustaining the growth \nof  SMEs.  This  is  no  different  in  Azerbaijan.  Appendix  1  discusses  the \ndevelopment impact of SME finance and Appendix 2 analyzes the SME financing \ngap in Asia.  \n \nThe  proposed  assistance  will  allow  BOB  to  provide  increased  financial \nintermediation to SMEs, in line with its strategic plans. The increased availability \nof  capital  or  funding  to  SMEs  would  help in  promoting  their  operations  and \nprofitability and enhancing their competitiveness, contributing to private sector \ndevelopment and translating into sustainable economic growth in Azerbaijan.   \n \n(ii)  Promote  development  in  the  non-oil  sector.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  is \ndominated by the oil sector and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable \nfuture. In the absence of further oil discoveries, the country\u2019s oil wealth is set to \npeak  relatively  early.  As  such,  the  diversification  of  the  economic  base  will \nbecome an increasingly important means to sustaining growth and will reduce \nthe  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  a  sustained  fall  in  oil  prices.  The  proposed \ntransaction, which will indirectly lead to increased lending to SMEs that, as of the \npresent,  have  limited  access  to  bank  financing,  will  support  the  creation  of \nemployment opportunities for a broader portion of the population, outside the oil \nand gas sector.   \n \n(iii)  Support the emerging private banking sector. The proposed intervention will \nhelp strengthen the banking sector at a critical point in its development and \nenhance confidence in the county\u2019s banking system. The private banking sector \n ", "6      \nis small and underdeveloped, and not fully able to mobilize the available liquidity \nand channel it toward SME investment through extension of credit. Support for \nthe growth of a promising and well-managed private bank will contribute to the \nshift away from the state-owned banks\u2019 dominance of the sector. As private \nbanks  are  a  key  source  of  small  and  micro  loans  for  the  private  sector,  in \nparticular individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, they are critical to the economy \n(state-owned banks are not geared to service SMEs, particularly private ones).    \n \n(iv)  New and innovative way of local currency funding. ADB is introducing a new \nand innovative form of local currency financing. This particular structure can be \nreplicated by BOB and other banks in Azerbaijan to gain access to local currency \nfunding,  thereby  reducing  currency  mismatches.  Although  Azerbaijan  is  still \nheavily  dollarized,  local  currency  lending  is  on  the  rise  given  the  ongoing \nappreciation of the AZN. \n \n2.  Value Added by the Asian Development Bank \n28.  ADB\u2019s partnership with BOB will further enhance its reputation in the market, improving \nits ability to raise long-term deposits and issue bonds. This in turn will allow BOB to better \nmanage and reduce the risk of maturities mismatch. ADB\u2019s proposed loans will also allow BOB \nto expand its SME loan portfolio, while deposit growth catches up with loan growth. This \ntranslates into higher financing intermediation available to the SME sector.   \n \n29.  ADB will encourage and support BOB\u2019s adoption of better practices for critical banking \nfunctions (e.g., credit, asset liability management, anti-money laundering, anticorruption, and \nenvironmental safeguard policies and procedures).  \n \n3.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n30.  ADB will measure the expected development outcome of the loans in accordance with \nthe Design and Monitoring Framework (Appendix 3).  \n \n4.  Fit to Country and Sector Strategy \n31.  In response to ADB\u2019s draft country strategy and program initiating paper for Azerbaijan, \nthe Government has specifically requested ADB to focus on four priority areas: transport, water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  renewable  energy,  and  private  sector  development.5  Private  sector \ndevelopment is an integral component of the Government\u2019s sustainable development strategy, \nwhich is also an important thematic priority for ADB. Support for private sector development is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program updates for Azerbaijan and the interim \noperational strategy for Azerbaijan.6  \n \n32.  ADB has the opportunity to play a significant role in private sector development in \nAzerbaijan, with a number of possibilities for private sector operations in activities that could \nserve  as  important  demonstration  projects  with  a  catalytic  effect  on  regional  economic \ndevelopment. The deepening of financial intermediation, especially to SMEs, is crucial to private \nsector  development.  SMEs  typically  generate  the  most  new  jobs;  introduce  locally  (and \n                                                 \n5 Letter to ADB from the Ministry of Economic Development dated 27 October 2006. \n6 Five country strategy and program updates (CSPUs) have been prepared to better reflect the changing needs and \ndevelopment priorities of Azerbaijan. CSPU 2002\u20132004, CSPU 2003\u20132005, CSPU 2004\u20132006, CSPU 2005\u20132006, \nand CSPU 2006. ", "    7 \nsometimes globally) relevant innovative ideas, products, and business methods; and can push \neconomic reform and the modernization of uncompetitive economies. SME development is, thus, \na critical component of pro-poor growth strategies and is an important focus for ADB and other \nmultilateral and bilateral development institutions. \n \n33.  In March 2006, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved a private sector project involving the \nprovision of a financing package of up to $15 million consisting of equity investments and loans \nto privately owned banks and leasing companies in Azerbaijan.7 This was ADB\u2019s first private \nsector operations project in Azerbaijan. Since then, the Capital Markets and Financial Sector \nDivision  (PSCM)  of  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  has  invested \nconsiderable effort in exploring new opportunities and strengthening client relationships. ADB \ncontinues its dialogue with various banks in the country, in line with ADB\u2019s focus on the banking \nsector to improve financial intermediation to the non-oil sector. This Project is a continuation of \nthose efforts. \n \n34.  The proposed loans are also aligned with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy,8 which \nstates that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital markets,\u201d \nsince these are seen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and \nensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth\u201d. \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n35.  The  proposed  loans  are  classified  category  FI  (financial  intermediary)  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). BOB will be required to establish an environmental management \nsystem that will cover the environmental assessment procedures of all sub-loans to be financed \nwith  ADB  funds.  The  proposed  loans  are  classified  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  as  no  involuntary \nresettlements  or  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  foreseen  in  relation  to  any \nactivities of BOB. The environmental policies of EBRD are already in place. ADB will ensure that \nBOB\u2019s  existing  environmental  management  system,  which  is  based  on  EBRD  standards, \nconforms to ADB standards. Significant environmental impacts are not expected, as BOB will \nuse proceeds of the proposed loans for onlending exclusively to SMEs (verified during due \ndiligence). \n \nC.  Anticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering,  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n36.  BOB has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.9 Consistent with its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  BOB \nthrough covenants in the loan documentation to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  to \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities.  \n                                                 \n7 To date, a total of $12 million of loans have been disbursed: $4 million to Microfinance Bank of Azerbaijan, \n$4 million to Azerigazbank, and $4 million to Bank Respublika. \n8 ADB. 1999.

The proposed investment would, if approved by the Board, be ADB\u2019s second non-\nsovereign investment in Azerbaijan, represent 33% of ADB\u2019s total non-sovereign exposure in \nAzerbaijan and increase ADB\u2019s non-sovereign investments in the banking sector from 11.17% \nto 11.33%. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, industry, group, and single \nproject exposure limits for non-sovereign investments. \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n38.

Growth and modernization in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector is \noften associated with successful economic development, particularly in low-income countries. In \nturn, such growth and modernization are associated with general poverty reduction. SMEs play \na crucial role in driving economic growth in both developing and developed countries. They \ntypically  generate  the  most  new  jobs;  introduce  locally  (and  sometimes  globally)  relevant \ninnovative ideas, products, and business methods; and can push economic reform and the \nmodernization of uncompetitive economies. \n \n2.  SME  development  is  also  often  seen  as  a  critical  component  of  pro-poor  growth \nstrategies: \n \n(i)  SMEs generate many of the new jobs in the economy. Since many of these jobs \nare suitable for semiskilled or unskilled workers, they can be taken up by the \npoor. \n \n(ii)  SMEs introduce business methods, products, and services that help restructure \nweak agricultural sector or other uncompetitive transition economies, thereby \nabsorbing labor that would otherwise drop into the ranks of the poor. \n \n(iii)  SMEs help spread the benefits of economic growth by engaging low-income \ngroups  in  national  development.  They  form  dynamic  supply  chain  linkages \nbetween small-scale producers and lucrative urban, national, or export markets.  \nIn the reverse direction, they link large urban business with mass consumer \nmarkets in remote areas. \n \n3.  The following are the effects of SMEs on poverty: \n \n(i)   Removal of bias against labor-intensive production. The removal of market \ndistortions that lead to a bias against labor-intensive production techniques \nshould have a clearly positive impact in reducing poverty. Reducing poverty \nmay improve the environment for SME expansion, so that these efforts can be \nexpected to be mutually reinforcing. Although the expansion of SMEs may not \nbe  sufficient  for  poverty  reduction,  the  likely  positive  effects\u2014through  the \nfamilies  of  SMEs  employees,  better  utilization  of  more  general  aid  donor \ninterventions  across  firms,  and  the  resulting  acceleration  of  human  and \ncommunity  development\u2014make  it  plausible  to  suppose  that  there  is  an \nenormous \u201cvalue\u201d in fighting poverty by investing in SMEs. \n \n(ii)  The effect of employing relatively low skilled workers. It is likely that both \nSMEs and their suppliers, on average, employ a greater share of local, low \nskilled  workers  than  large  firms  or  suppliers  to  large  firms.  Since  these \nworkers  plausibly  spend  a  larger  share  of  their  income  on  other  products \nproduced by less skilled workers, there is more likely to be a positive multiplier \neffect  on  the  alleviation  of  poverty  through  SME  support  than  through \ndevelopment projects that lack this focus. \n \n                                                 \n1  SEAF. The development impact of small and medium enterprises: lessons learned from SEAF investments. \nVolume 1.Washington: Small Enterprises Assistance Funds.  \n ", "10      Appendix 1 \n \n(iii)   Linkage to small suppliers. It is plausible that SMEs have more supply links \nthan  large  firms  to  the  local  economy,  given  their  small  size  or  lesser \nsophistication, which would generally inhibit sourcing directly from abroad. \nSMEs probably import fewer intermediate goods than large firms, suggesting \na larger local multiplier effect. It is also a reasonable hypothesis that SMEs \nbuy a greater percentage of these products from labor-intensive SMEs. This, in \nturn, should lead to a greater expansion of sustainable, local, employment \nbenefits. \n \n(iv)   Security of employment. When employees leave microenterprises to accept \nSME  employment,  their  wage  incomes  are  likely  to  rise  and  become  less \nvariable, making it easier to plan for their families\u2019 welfare. \n \n(v)  Impact on children through employment of mothers. If investment in an SME \nraises the incomes of poor mothers with small children, the impact on poverty \ncan be great. Development microeconomics consistently shows that a much \nlarger fraction of an extra dollar earned by a mother goes to the welfare of her \nchildren than of an extra dollar earned by the father. This holds for spending \non children\u2019s health and education, as well as home improvements and other \nimportant factors. The impact is especially significant for daughters.  \n(vi)   Magnified impact on poverty reduction among very poor people. Targeting \na small number of very poor people provides greater social benefits than \ntargeting a larger number of less poor people. Thus, to the degree that SMEs \nhire  relatively  poor  people,  the  impact  of  any  given  income  increase  on \npoverty would be magnified. Given the correlation between wage level and \nskill level, the tendency of SMEs to hire more unskilled people than larger \nenterprises suggests that this magnified impact is likely at the SME level. \n \n(vii)   SME tax payments. Tax revenues are used to implement poverty impacting \nprograms, such as local infrastructure improvements, health services, or school \nmeals. Since SMEs contribute more tax revenue than microenterprises (which \nin practice may pay few or no taxes) or large firms (which can often find \nloopholes or use their influence to pay less than statutory tax rates), support to \nSMEs could be expected to have a greater indirect impact on poverty reduction \nthan other forms of developmental assistance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  11 \nSMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISE FINANCING GAP IN ASIA  \n \n1.  Restricted access to formal credit is one of the main challenges faced by small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Asia today, and often hinders them from developing their \nfull potential. Whereas all types of firms mostly rely on retained earnings, SMEs are more \ndependent on these funds than large firms.   \n2.  The larger the firm, the easier is access to bank credit and the better the loan conditions \nit receives. Loans to large customers are encouraged by banks through employee incentive \nschemes, which are often based on the amount of credit granted. In addition, a vast array of \nalternatives to domestic bank loans are available to large firms, e.g., recourse to capital or \ninternational  financial  markets,  augments  their  bargaining  power  in  negotiation  a  loan.  In \ncontrast to large firms, SMEs are often unable to cover their financing needs. Since SMEs \nreceive less finance or face worse conditions than larger firms, they are at a competitive \ndisadvantage. Without sufficient long-term finance, SMEs are unable to expand their business \nand introduce productivity enhancing technology.   \n3.  The limitation of banking services available to SMEs is mainly due to the following \nreasons. \n \n(i)  State-owned banks (as in the People\u2019s Republic of China) are not geared to \nservice SMEs, particularly private ones.  \n(ii)  Other banking institutions have limited coverage and financial products. The high \nfrequency and short-term nature of SME loans, unfamiliar markets, ownership \nstructures  that  are  often  complicated,  and  lack  of  sufficient  and  reliable \noperational and financial data for loan appraisal have resulted in high business \ndevelopment and administration costs for banks. Because of the long process of \nrecognition, registration, and evaluation for the SME borrower\u2019s collateral, banks \nhave difficulties meeting the SMEs\u2019 frequent and seasonal demand for debt.  \n(iii)  To reduce nonperforming loans, many commercial banks have adopted a policy \nof permanently assigning the responsibility of loan performance to loan officers. \nThis has resulted in acute risk aversion at the subbranch and loan officer level, \ncurtailing the amount of loans to SMEs. \n(iv)  Most developing member countries (DMCs) lack a diversified financial sector \ncapable of serving SMEs, i.e., focused financial institutions that are specialized in \nproviding loans for SMEs are missing or are only marginal market participants.  \n(v)  In many markets, credit allocation is distorted by continued policy lending through \ngovernment-owned banks, and restrictions on competition from foreign financial \ninstitutions. \n(vi)  In  many  instances,  regulated  (domestic)  bank  lending  rates  do  not  allow \ndomestic banks to price risks appropriately and therefore, banks shy away from \nthis asset, which is often perceived as highly risky. However, this is not true for \nall  cases,  if  appropriate  protection  is  sought  and  thorough  due  diligence  is \nundertaken. \n \n4.  Banks cite four main reasons for their reluctance to extend credit to SMEs.  \n \n5.  High Administrative Costs of Small-Scale Lending. Since most of the administrative \ncosts of lending are fixed, i.e., independent of the size of the administered loan, economies of \n ", "12      Appendix 2 \nscale arise\u2014the larger the loan, the lower the unit costs of extending credit. Furthermore, \nadministrative  costs  also  include  information  gathering  costs,  e.g.,  visiting  borrowers, \nanalyzing their applications, and monitoring their loans. For a number of reasons, these costs \ntend to be higher for small than for large firms. SMEs are often located away from the main \nurban  centers,  their  accounting  skills  and  standards  are  usually  lower,  and  banks  lack \nexperience in servicing them. \n6.  Asymmetric  Information. A prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources by \nmarket forces is that all participants share the same relevant information. This is not the case in \nfinancial markets. Borrowers will always know more about the viability of their projects and their \nability and willingness to repay than lenders. The lender is thus faced with uncertainty\u2014both \nwith respect to the expected rates of return of the project he is financing, as well as the integrity \nof the borrower. This uncertainty increases with the length of the loan. Borrowers face difficulties \nin transmitting information about their projects to lenders, as lenders will suspect them of \nunderestimating the risks of failure. The problem of asymmetric information is more acute for \nSMEs than larger firms because of lower information standards and greater variability of risk\u2014\nsmall, privately owned firms face no legal reporting requirements and are more vulnerable \nthan large firms. \n \n7.  Because  of  asymmetric  information,  it  is  impossible  to  distinguish  accurately \nbetween good and bad borrowers. The two main problems associated with asymmetric \ninformation are adverse selection and moral hazard, both of which may affect the quality \nof the loan. Adverse selection refers to the fact that the probability of default increases \nwith the interest rate\u2014the quality of the borrower pool worsens as the cost of borrowing \nrises. A higher interest rate will attract risky borrowers and drive out good borrowers for \ntwo reasons: (i) worse risks are willing to borrow at higher interest rates because they \nknow that their repayment probability is low; and (ii) if riskier projects are associated with \nhigher returns, a rise in the interest rate will drive out low-risk projects as borrowers try to \ncompensate for the higher cost of the loan by earning a higher return with a risky project. \nAn optimal interest rate may therefore exist, beyond which additional loans are not made \navailable despite excess demand. Consequently, a backward-bending credit supply curve \nand  equilibrium  credit  rationing  will  exist  because  raising  the  interest  rate  above  the \noptimal level would lower banks\u2019 profits as the amount of risky projects in their portfolio \nrises (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981). SMEs are more likely to be rationed because they are seen \nas particularly risky. Although they might be willing to pay more to compensate for this \nadditional risk, banks will refuse to raise the interest rate sufficiently to equate supply \nand demand. \n \n8.  Moral hazard refers to a situation in which an agent (the borrower) takes an action that \nadversely affects the return to the principal (the lender). It occurs if the parties involved \nhave diverging interests and the action taken by the agent cannot be monitored accurately \nby the principal. A borrower may, for example, be tempted to exert less effort or secretly \nswitch to riskier projects in order to increase his return. Because of a higher probability of \ndefault, the return to the bank will be reduced. Banks can resort to two methods to reduce \nmoral hazard: (i) by making it profitable to tell the truth, e.g., through the promise of \nrenewed  credit  in  the  future;  and/or  (ii)  by  including  penalties  for  low  effort  levels, \ne.g., collateral,  which  are  lost  if  the  firm  becomes  insolvent.  Because  of  information \nimperfections and costly control mechanisms, the superior selection criteria based on cash-\nflow projections is often abandoned in favor of loan selection according to firm size and \ncollateral. This results in suboptimal allocation of credit since some firms with profitable \nprojects may be deprived of credit simply because of their size or insufficient capital.   ", "    Appendix 2  13 \n9.  High Risk Perception. Commercial banks tend to assign a high risk to SMEs and \nare reluctant to extend credit to them. Because of their small size and inherent vulnerability \nto market fluctuations, the mortality rates of SMEs are relatively high. These firms are often \nrelatively  young,  and  lack  a  financial  history  and  track  record  of  profitable  projects. \nOrganizational  and  administrative  deficiencies,  lower  quality  management,  and  lack  of \nappropriate accounting systems may also compromise the accessibility and reliability of \ninformation  from  small  firms  on  their  repayment  capacity.  In  addition,  small  loans  to \nindustry are often classified as personal loans. Therefore, banks may lack concrete figures \nof the level of profitability of loans to small enterprises and what costs they entail. Finally, \nthe relative labor intensity of SMEs implies a high debt-to-asset ratio if loans are made. The \nassociated  vulnerability  and  lack  of  sufficient  and  adequate  collateral  further  limits  the \namount of finance that banks are willing to grant them. \n \n10.  In Asia, the disadvantage of SMEs with regard to risk perception is aggravated by a \nnumber of factors. Many SMEs have evolved in the informal economy, making it difficult for \nthem  to  document  their  business  history  and  demonstrate  their  economic  potential. \nAdditionally,  small  entrepreneurs  in  emerging  economies  are  typically  less  skilled  in \nbookkeeping, marketing, and management than their counterparts in industrial countries, \nadding to the risk perception with regard to their projects. This is exacerbated by inadequate \nlegal frameworks, which make the enforcement of contracts difficult for lenders. \n \n11.  Lack of Collateral. Under optimal conditions, the net present value of a firm's profit \nstream  should  determine  the  amount  of  credit  it  receives.  However,  because  of  the \nexistence of asymmetric information, banks base their lending decisions on the amount of \ncollateral available. Collateral acts as a screening device and reduces the risk of lending for \ncommercial banks. By pledging its assets, a borrower signals the quality of its project and \nintention to repay. In the case of default, collateral puts the lender in a privileged position \nwith regard to other creditors. Banks\u2019 acceptance of a certain asset as collateral depends on \nthe present and anticipated transaction costs involved. These include the costs of verifying \nownership  of  assets,  determining  their  value  and  marketability,  as  well  as  the  ease  of \nappropriating  and  access  in  comparison  to  other  lenders.  Despite  its  advantages  for \nlenders, the policy of demanding collateral often inhibits SMEs with viable projects from \nattaining credit. Their lack of adequate collateral arises from their labor intensity and from \nthe low value of their machinery and property. \n \n12.  In  Asia,  problems  in  the  legal  system  make  debt  enforcement  and  the  use  of \ncollateral difficult. Potential borrowers may be unable to pledge some of their assets as \ncollateral because they are unable to prove they own them, because of inappropriately \ndefined property rights. Additionally, moveable assets such as machinery or livestock, \nwhich constitute a large share of small firms\u2019 assets, are often excluded as collateral. \nSince movable property may be difficult to store, its value declines over time (equipment \ndepreciates and livestock dies), and inefficient secondary markets lead to high liquidation \ncosts, lenders typically demand real estate as collateral instead. However, this is likely to \nbelong to large firms or rich landowners. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "14      Appendix 3 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nThe GDP  \u2022  Percentage of  \u2022  NBA statistics  \u2022  Increase access to \ncomposition of the  GDP contributed    finance from banks will \nAzerbaijan  economy  by SME sector  lead to more SMEs \nis more diversified  rises from 10% to  receiving loans and \n(i.e. more SMEs, in  15% in 5 years  expanding their role in \nmore sectors,  \u2022  Percentage of  the economy \ncontribute to a more  employment  \u2022  Stable or increased \ndiversified economy)  contributed by  economic \nSME sector rises  development in \nfrom 75% to 85%  Azerbaijan \nin 5 years   \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n  \u2022  BOB\u2019s number of  \u2022  BOB\u2019s quarterly and   \nBOB provides  outstanding SME  annual financial  \u2022  There is demand for \nincreased,  loans increases  statements  loans from SMEs \nsustainable access to  (10% in next 24  \u2022  Reports specifically  \u2022  BOB does not breach \nfinance to SMEs in  months, from 296  requested by ADB  domestic prudential / \nAzerbaijan, in part in  to 325)  NBA norms \nlocal currency  \u2022  BOB\u2019s credit  \u2022  No adverse economic \n  quality is high \u2013  developments in \nNPL level less  Azerbaijan \nthan 3.0%  \u2022  No regulatory changes \n\u2022  BOB\u2019s ROE stays  for the banking sector \nabove 18.0%  \u2022  No other exogenous \n\u2022  BOB\u2019S maintains  factors that have a \nat least 2.0% ROA  negative impact on \n\u2022  BOB\u2019s CAR  banking sector \nremains above  development  \nNBA requirements   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n\u2022  ADB provides and  \u2022  As of July 2007,  \u2022  BOB\u2019s quarterly and  \u2022  Stability of prevailing \nUSD and AZN  BOB has $6 million  annual financial  market conditions \nloans  in USD equivalent  statements  \u2022  All regulatory approvals \n\u2022  BOB  \u2022  Loan requests  \u2022  Reports specifically  in place for ADB  \noperationalizes  received by BOB  requested by ADB   \nuse of loan  increase by 15%  \nproceeds  per annum from \n  current levels ", "    Appendix 3  15 \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.1 Provide BOB with a $4.0 million loan and $2.0 million loan in local  \u2022  ADB - $4.0 million + \ncurrency by July 2007   $2.0 million in local \n\u2022  ADB and BOB enter into a loan agreement  currency \n \n1.2 Operationalization of loan proceeds by BOB (ongoing). \n\u2022  Origination of (new) client opportunities \n\u2022  Due diligence on clients \n\u2022  Completion of loan agreements with clients \n\u2022  Disbursement of loans to clients \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank; BOB = Bank of Baku; AZN = Azerbaijan manat; NBA = National Bank of Azerbaijan; \nNPL = non-performing loan; ROA = return on asset; ROE = return on equity; SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070823161843+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070823143908+08'00'", "Title": "Debt Financing to Bank of Baku", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Author": "NPP", "Keywords": "rrp:aze 41915, baku bank debt financing, financial banking sector,small mediumsized enterprise sector,economic development", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20070823063847"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 May 2007) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Azerbaijan new manat/s (AZN) \n \nAZN1.00 =  $1.0953   \n$1.00 =  AZN0.9130   \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n    ADB    \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nBOB    \u2013  Bank of Baku \nCAR    \u2013  capital adequacy ratio \nCSPU   \u2013  country strategy and program update \nDMC    \u2013  developing member country \nEBRD   \u2013  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nGDP    \u2013  gross domestic product \nNBA    \u2013  National Bank of Azerbaijan \nSME    \u2013  small and medium-sized enterprise \n         \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n   \nVice President  L.
