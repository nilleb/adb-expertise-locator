The  new \nrolling stock will enable Bangladesh Railway to satisfy steadily growing demand and increase its \nmarket share. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nHistorically,  the  railway  enjoyed  a  monopoly  as  a  carrier  and  carried  most  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  commodities  and  passengers.  With  the  gradual  emergence  of  road  transport,  the \nrailway began losing market share, which declined from 30% in 1975 to a mere 4% in 2005 for \nboth  passenger  and  freight  transport.  Despite  a  growing  demand  for  transport,  Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s  market  share  in  passenger  and  freight  transport  has  declined  due  to  a  lack  of \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  and  rolling  stock  (its  transport  capacity  is  the  same  as  it  was  in \n1975). Railway travel in Bangladesh is safer, more energy-efficient and reliable, and has a lower \nenvironmental impact than other modes of transport. Railway transport is also considered more \ncomfortable than long-distance buses. Intercity trains operated by Bangladesh Railway are very \npopular.  Occupancy  is  very  high,  especially  in  the  east  zone  (98%);  intercity  trains  in  the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  are  usually  sold  out.  About  40%  of  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s \npassengers  travel  by  intercity  trains,  which  account for more  than  75% of  passenger  revenue. \nThe high demand for intercity service in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridors cannot be fully met and \nno  additional  trains  can  be  scheduled  to  tap  into  the  lucrative  market  for  Bangladesh  Railway \ndue to insufficient line capacity and rolling stock availability. \n \n4. \nThe  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015)  includes  the  improvement  of \nrailways  as  energy  efficient  multimodal  transport  systems  to  reduce  carbon  emissions. 2 The \nRailway  Sector  Master  Plan  towards  2030,  approved  in  2013,  noted  the  railway  sector  must \nsignificantly improve its efficiency and service quality, and establish better connectivity in order \nto survive as a viable mode of transport.3 The government\u2019s strategy is to increase Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s  market  share  from  4%  to  15%  in  freight  transport,  from  10%  to  15%  in  container \ntransport between Dhaka and Chittagong Port, and from 4% to 10% in passenger transport. The \nrailway  will  focus  on  lucrative  market  segments and  provide  (i)  long-distance  passenger  traffic \nvia intercity trains, (ii) long-haul freight traffic along selected corridors, and (iii) container traffic \n(mainly between Dhaka and Chittagong Port). To achieve this, the government is (i) augmenting \nline capacity along main corridors; (ii) procuring modern locomotives, passenger carriages, and \nfreight  wagons;  and  (iii)  reforming  Bangladesh  Railway,  introducing  a  modern  financial \nmanagement  system,  improving  operation  and  maintenance,  and  establishing  a  human \nresource management system. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2011.

Dhaka. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  the  government\u2019s  sector  strategy \n5. \nthrough  (i)  investments  in  infrastructure  development  for  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  and  Dhaka\u2013\nKhulna main railway corridors in Bangladesh through the Railway Sector Investment Program,4 \n(ii) the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Railway Connectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam \nDouble  Track  Project,5 and  (iii)  sector  reforms.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \nfinanced  upgrading  of  the  Laksam\u2013Chinki  Astana  section  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor, \nprocurement  of  11  locomotives,  modernization  of  a  rolling  stock  workshop  in  Chittagong,  and \nupgrading  of  the  Chittagong  Station  Yard.  The  upgraded  infrastructure  financed  by  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency was completed in 2015, and the projects financed by ADB will \nbe completed in 2016. \n \n6. \nBangladesh Railway has a shortage of modern and reliable rolling stock: of the fleet of \n282 locomotives and 1,476 passenger carriages, 76 locomotives and 651 passenger carriages \nhave  passed  their  economic  life  of  35  years  and  need  to  be  replaced.  Procurement  of  70 \nlocomotives  and  270  passenger  carriages  is  ongoing;  together  with  20  multiple  units  recently \ncommissioned,  this  will  enable  Bangladesh  Railway  to  replace  the  majority  of  the  oldest  and \nleast-efficient rolling stock. \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  finance  approximately  264  passenger  carriages,  10  locomotives,  and \nadditional  state-of-the-art  maintenance  equipment,  which  will  support  the  maintenance  of  new \nand  existing  rolling  stock  and  provide  training  facilities  for  train  drivers,  who  will  operate  the \nadditional  trains. 6   The    capacity  of    Bangladesh    Railway  to  maintain    rolling    stock    was \nstrengthened  by  the  updating  of  several  of  its  operation  manuals  as  part  of  the  Bangladesh \nRailway  Reform  Project  (footnote  4);  the  rolling  stock  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with \nthese manuals. \n \n8. \nThe project is part of ADB\u2019s railway sector development strategy to support a series of \ninvestment  projects  in  infrastructure,  railway  reform,  and  institutional  capacity  development  to \nimprove overall transport capacity. Adding rolling stock to Bangladesh Railway\u2019s fleet will enable \nit to use its enhanced infrastructure capacity by running additional passenger trains, and thereby \nsatisfy  the  increasing  demand  for  trips  by  train.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132015, 7 which  aims  to  reduce  high  transport  and \nlogistical costs in support of sustainable and inclusive economic growth by connecting all parts \nof the country with national and regional markets. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  processed  as  a  stand-alone  project  loan  embedded  into  ADB\u2019s  railway \nsector development strategy and ongoing projects, as the implementation period is comparably \n                                                \n4  ADB.  2006.

Manila.  This  project  improves  the  performance  of  the  railway  sector  by  implementing  (i)  a \nreform  project  of  sector  policy,  organizational,  and  capacity-building  reforms  to  make  Bangladesh  Railway  more \ncommercially focused, and improve governance and accountability; and (ii) an investment project that finances (a) \nthe construction of 64 kilometers of double tracks in the Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazaar section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nmain line, including signaling and implementation consulting services; (b) extension of loop lines; (c) modernization \nof signaling in the Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Indian border section; and (d) 150 passenger carriages. \n\n5  ADB. 2014.

This  project  will  upgrade  the  72-kilometer \nAkhaura\u2013Laksam  section  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  railway  corridor  to  a  double-track  railway  line  with  modern \nsignaling equipment. \n\n6  The  10  locomotives  and  264  passenger  carriages  to  be  financed  under  this  project  are  in  addition  to  those \n\nmentioned in para. 6, which are already on order by Bangladesh Railway. \n7  ADB. 2010. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n\n\fshort  and  project  readiness  is  high,  with  government  approvals  and  bid  documents  well \nadvanced.  ADB  financing  will  ensure  timely  delivery  of  a  larger  number  of  locomotives  and \npassenger carriages at competitive prices. \n \nThe  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  interventions  in  the \n10. \nBangladesh  railway  sector.  To  avoid  startup  delays,  project  preparation  began  early,  in \nconjunction with the existing project implementation unit (PIU), which is well experienced in ADB \nproject  implementation  and  procurement  processes;  support  from  staff  consultants  is  being \nprovided  to facilitate  procurement  and government  internal  approvals,  which  will  be  completed \nbefore loan approval. Project readiness is high\u2014bid document preparation is well advanced and \nthe overall project design focuses on the procurement of rolling stock and equipment as part of \nADB\u2019s \ninvestments,  capacity \nrailway  sector  strategy,  and  supplements \ndevelopment, and reform activities supported by other projects. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ninfrastructure \n\nThe  impact  will  be  efficient  and  safe  railway  transport  in  Bangladesh,  aligned  with  the \n11. \nSixth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015).8 The outcome will be increased railway transport capacity in \nthe main line network of Bangladesh Railway. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe project has two outputs. Output 1 comprises the procurement and commissioning of \nnew  rolling  stock  consisting  of  approximately  264  passenger  carriages  and  10  diesel  electric \nlocomotives for Bangladesh Railway's meter gauge main line network. Output 2 comprises the \nprocurement  and  commissioning  of  new  equipment  consisting  of  approximately  four  relief \ncranes, two train washing plants, and one simulator for loco-master training. \n \nD. \n \n13. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $294 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n214 meter-gauge passenger carriages \n50 broad-gauge passenger carriages \n10 diesel locomotives \n4 relief cranes \n2 train washing plants \n1 simulator for loco-master training \nProject management and inspections \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $65 million to be financed from government resources as counterpart funds. \nb  In mid-2015 prices. \nc  Price contingencies computed at 8% on foreign exchange costs and 6% on local currency costs; includes provision \n                                                \n8  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2011.

Under ADB\u2019s ongoing \nRailway  Sector  Investment  Program  (footnote  4),  an  investment  PIU  was  established  with \nexperienced  staff;  two  specialized  PIUs  will  be  established  to  implement  this  project,  each \nheaded by a project director. Procurement for contracts to be financed under the project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\ftime).  All  contracts  for  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive \nbidding  procedures.  ADB  standard  bidding  documents  with  post qualification  under  the  single-\nstage,  two-envelope  system  will  be  adopted.  Advance  procurement  action  for  goods  and \nservices is proposed to enhance project readiness and ensure faster disbursement of the loan. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n18. \nThe  project  will  finance  additional  railway  rolling  stock  in  line  with  international  design \nstandards  and  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  updated  technical  specifications;  all  rolling  stock  and \nequipment procured under this project is based on the existing design standards of Bangladesh \nRailway.  As  a  result,  Bangladesh  Railway  staff  are  well  familiar  with  the  materials  and \nconstruction  methods  used.  Where  modern  materials  are  used,  the  technical  requirements \ninclude  ample  time  and  resources  to  properly  train  and  familiarize  staff  with  the  new \ntechnologies. As-built documentation will be provided by the contractor for all components and \nequipment procured under the project to ensure that operation and maintenance will be carried \nout as specified by the manufacturers. \n \n19. \nBangladesh Railway has recruited a team of national and international experts to inspect \nthe  passenger  carriages,  locomotives,  relief  cranes,  washing  plants,  and  simulator  to  be \nprocured under this loan at the manufacturer\u2019s premises before shipment to Bangladesh. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  have  been  undertaken  and  concluded  the  project\u2019s \nlending  decision  is  based  more  on  the  economic  than  the  financial  viability,  as  detailed  in  the \neconomic and financial analysis.10 \n\n21. \nThe project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 26.4%. The economic \nanalysis  compares  the  benefits  and  costs  of  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  main \nbenefits  are  a  reduction  in  the  generalized  cost  and  savings  in  bus  operating  costs  due  to \ndecongestion on the roads caused by passengers shifting from bus to rail transport , and time \nsavings.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  the  project  would  remain  economically  viable  in  the \nevents of (i) a 10.0% increase in capital cost, (ii) a 10.0% reduction in benefits, and (iii) a 1-year \ndelay in project commencement. The results show the quantified economic benefits are robust; \nthe  project  has  an  EIRR  well  above  12.0%  in  all  sensitivity  tests.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  a  \n10.0%  increase  in  capital  cost  and  a  10.0%  reduction  in  benefits  occurred  together,  the  EIRR \nremains above the 12.0% benchmark. \n \nA financial analysis has been undertaken to assess the financial viability of the project, \n22. \nusing a similar approach to that employed for the economic analysis. As a public utility service \nprovider, the government subsidizes Bangladesh Railway to cover its operating expenses. The \nfinancial  analysis  considered  with-subsidy  and  without-subsidy  scenarios.  The  with-subsidy \nfinancial internal rate of return is about 5.2%, while the without-subsidy financial internal rate of \nreturn  is  about  \u20133.7%.  The  annual  incremental  recurrent  cost  associated  with  the  project  is \nestimated  to  be  1.7%  of  the  overall  budget  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways  in  FY2014.  The \ngovernment is seeking to establish and implement a new tariff scheme, which would contribute \n\n                                                \n10 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nto  reducing  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  subsidy  level.  It  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  a  sufficient \nfinancial sustainability of both the project and Bangladesh Railway will be maintained.11 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  A \n\nfinancial  management  assessment  concluded \n\n23. \nthat \nBangladesh  Railway  has  adequate  capacity  to  undertake  financial  management  of  ADB-\nfinanced projects. Bangladesh Railway has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects funded  under the  ADB  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program.  Bangladesh  Railway  has \nknowledge  of  project  financial  accounting  methods  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures,  and \ntheir staff have participated in workshops on financial management good practice conducted by \nADB. Bangladesh Railway\u2019s capacity is being further strengthened through implementation of a \nnew accounting and financial management system by the Bangladesh Railway Reform Project \n(footnote 4). The overall financial management capacity is adequate but, given the country risk \nrating, the project risk is considered moderate. \n \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \n24. \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  will  review  documents  and  submissions  related  to \nprocurement  at  all  major  milestones  prior  to  proceeding  with  the  procurement  process.  The \nprocurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international financial institutions \nsuch  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption.  National  procurement \nregulations  have  improved  through  the  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006,  and  through  related \nPublic  Procurement  Rules  (2008),  with  subsequent  amendments  and  the  establishment  of  a \nCentral  Procurement  Technical  Unit  under  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  Bangladesh  Railway.  The  specific \npolicy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual  (footnote  9). In October  2012,  a  National  Integrity  Strategy (NIS)  was  approved  and  a \nNational  Integrity  Advisory  Committee  formed,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  to  oversee  the \nanticorruption  activities  and  implement  the  strategy.  The  NIS  includes  a  road  map  for \nstrengthening  both  the  state  and  non-state  accountability  institutions  to  fight  corruption  and \nimprove  governance.  Under  the  NIS,  all  line  ministries  and  key  watchdog  institutions  have \nformed  ethics  committees  and  appointed  focal  points  to  implement  corruption-prevention \nprograms and actions. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nPoverty  and  social.  Data from 2010 indicates 17.6% of the population lives below the \npoverty line.12 The poverty incidence in the country is high, although the national poverty level \ndeclined  by  8.5%  during  2005\u20132010  (an  average  of  1.7  percentage  points  per  year). \nBangladesh Railway is one of the principal modes of transportation in the country due to its low \nfares,  safety,  and  punctuality  compared  with  other  transport  modes.  The  new  passenger \ncarriages procured under the project will provide safer, more comfortable, and faster passenger \ntransport in all ticketed classes. Wheelchair access will be included on at least one carriage per \nrake, promoting comfort and social inclusion. The potential long-term socioeconomic benefits of \nnew  carriages  include  development  of  industrial  and  micro  and  small  and  medium-sized \n\n                                                \n11 The  tariff  reform  and  other  efficiency  improvement  initiatives  are  supported  by  the  Bangladesh  Railway  Reform \n\n12 Ministry  of  Planning,  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2010.  Report  of  the  Household  Income  and  Expenditure \n\nProject (footnote 4). \n\nSurvey 2010. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\fenterprises along the railways; improved access to employment opportunities, and educational \nand health care facilities; and decreased travel time and cost. \n \n26. \nGender,  HIV/AIDS,  and  trafficking.  Railways are considered one of the most reliable, \ncomfortable,  and  safest  modes  of  land  transportation,  and  women  passengers  are  important \nrailway users who will benefit from the project. Rail services allow women passengers to access \neducational  and  health  facilities,  and  transport  their  products  at  a  reasonable  cost.  Although \ngender is not a specific focus of Ministry of Railway documents (e.g., the National Rail Transport \nPolicy,  Citizen  Charters,  and  Railway  Master  Plan),  the  ministry  has  undertaken  steps  to \npromote the comfort and safety of female passengers.13 Modern services for women\u2014such as \nseparate toilets, ticket counters, waiting rooms, and prayer rooms\u2014have been installed in major \nstations  to  make  rail  transportation  more  attractive  to  and  comfortable  for  women,  and  to \nencourage  them  to  travel  alone.  The  project  does  not  offer  opportunities  to  address  gender-\ninclusive designs of public spaces such as station buildings, as it supports only procurement of \nrolling stock. However, the passenger carriages will include unisex-type toilets that allow use by \nboth  females  and  males.  The  project  is  not  anticipated  to  contribute  to  an  increase  in  the \nincidence of HIV/AIDS or trafficking, as it only involves the procurement of passenger carriages. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe project is limited to the procurement of rolling stock and equipment that will operate \n27. \non existing railway lines. According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is \nclassified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nimpacts.  The  review  of  environmental  impacts  indicates  that  there  will  be  no  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  during  project  implementation.  During  project  operation,  there  will  be  a \nnet environmental benefit through reductions in carbon dioxide emission due to a modal shift of \npassengers from road to rail, and the use of more efficient locomotives. Recommendations for \nproper solid and liquid waste management during project operations have been provided. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.14 The integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nProject \nimplementation \ndelay \n\nDelay in \nreleasing \ncounterpart \nfunds \n\nRailways). \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe start-up delay has been substantially reduced (by 3 years) compared with previous \nrailway projects in Bangladesh, as the design is complete and bid documents are being \nfinalized. Bidding will start soon and contracts are targeted to be awarded within 1 year \nafter loan approval. Progress of project implementation will be closely monitored by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n\nADB will finance all foreign exchange-related project costs, thereby reducing the \ngovernment\u2019s share of the project cost. The government will finance local taxes and \nduties related to the procurement, and government internal approvals for the \ncounterpart funding will be obtained before loan approval. This will significantly reduce \nthe risk of delays in delivery and commissioning of the rolling stock and goods to be \nprocured under the proposed loan. \n\n                                                \n13 Ministry of Finance, Finance Division. 2015.

Bangladesh Railway is familiar with ADB \nrequirements. The following actions will be taken to enhance good governance during \nprocurement: (i) ADB will closely monitor procurement activities on a daily basis to \nensure the timely completion of the procurement process; (ii) Bangladesh Railway will \ndisclose information about procurement-related information on project-specific \nwebsites; and (iii) ADB will engage a procurement adviser to monitor the procurement \nprocess, together with the procurement specialist in ADB\u2019s Bangladesh Resident \nMission. \n\nLack of \nfinancial \nsustainability \n\nOngoing sector reforms are designed to improve Bangladesh Railway\u2019s operational \nefficiency and financial performance, including a rationalized tariff policy; strengthened \nasset management; and improved financial reporting, accounting, and human resource \nmanagement. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n29. \nThe government and Bangladesh Railway have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n30. \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe government and Bangladesh Railway have  agreed with ADB on certain covenants \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n31. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Railway  Rolling  Stock  Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n8 September 2015 \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n9 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEfficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh (Sixth Five-Year Plan: 2011\u20132015)a \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nRisks \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \nBy 2021 \na.
