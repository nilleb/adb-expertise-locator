The Project will\npromote  the  use  of  new  crops  and  cropping  techniques  through\ntraining, extension, and credit provided by a partnership between\nthe  Government  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);\nupgrade  market  information  services  and  market  infrastructure;\npromote  improved  use  of  market  facilities  by  the  private  sector;\nand  provide  a  pilot  credit  line  for  postharvest  agribusiness\nactivities.  The  project  area  covers  16  districts  in  the  northwest\nregion and 3.2 million farmer households, more than half of whom\nare below the poverty line.\n\nCategory     -    B\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken.  The\nsummary IEE is a supplementary appendix (available on request)\nto this report.\n\nThe  northwest  region  is  one  of  the  Bangladesh's  poorest  and\nmost backward regions despite its favorable natural resources. It\nhas traditionally been at a disadvantage compared to other parts\nof  the  country  due  to  its  physical  isolation,  being  separated  from\nthe  rest  of  the  country  by  the  Jamuna  River  to  the  east  and  the\nGanges to the south. The construction of the Jamuna bridge has\npartly  alleviated  this  physical  constraint,  and  presented  new\nthe\nopportunities \nincomes of much of the population of the region. Moreover, much\nof  the  area  is  flood-free  and  characterized  by  well-drained  soils,\nadequate  supplies  of  groundwater  for  irrigation  and  a  varied\nclimate that is suited to a greater range of crops than that in other\nregions. There is thus scope for diversification to high value crops\n(HVCs).\n\nincreasing  agriculture  production  and \n\nfor \n\nThe  present  farming  system  is  rice-based.  Rice  is  grown  in  all\nthree  cropping  seasons,  high  yielding  varieties  cover  more  than\n80  percent  of  production,  and  cropping  intensity  is  above  175\npercent.  There  is,  thus,  little  scope  for  expanding  the  cropped\narea  or  the  cropping  intensity.  Future  income  enhancement\nopportunities for the farming community of this region therefore lie\nin  crops  that  can  provide  a  greater  value  of  production  per  unit\narea, than can high yielding varieties of rice.\n\nFactors,  in  addition  to  physical  isolation,  that  have  constrained\ndiversification  in  the  region  and  kept  incomes  low  and  stagnant\ninclude inadequate public research and extension on crops other\nthan  rice;  limited  participation  of  NGOs  and  the  private  sector  in\n\n\fiii\n\nagriculture  support  services;  farmers\u2019  lack  of  knowledge  of\nappropriate crops and varieties; their having inadequate access to\nplanting  material  and  production  technologies;  a  dearth  of\ninformation  on  market  potentials  and  prices;  and,  most\nimportantly,  difficulties  accessing  production  credit,  especially  for\nthe small-scale farmers.\n\nthem \n\nto  diversify \n\nThe  Project  was  thus  designed  to  improve  the  farmers\u2019  income\nto  HVCs  without\nlevels  by  assisting \ncompromising  household  food  security.  The  Project  will  address\nmany  of  the  identified  constraints  and  reach  a  large  number  of\nfarmers  with  information  and  know-how  needed  to  diversify  to\nnew  HVCs,  with  financial  resources  needed  to  purchase  inputs\nand  equipment,  and  with  assistance  to  market  their  produce  at\nbetter  prices.  This  will  benefit  the  participating  farmers  and  the\nregion's economy as a whole; the labor market, due to increased\nlabor demand; and regional nutrition, as new and more nutritious\nvegetables and fruits become available.\n\nThe  proposed  Project  is  aimed  at  improving  farm  incomes  and\nreducing  poverty  in  the  northwest  region.  The  specific  objectives\nare  to  promote  production  and  more  efficient  marketing  of  HVCs\nand to build sustainable partnerships with and capacities of NGOs\nand  the  public  sector  agencies  in  agriculture  extension  and  crop\nfinance.  Poverty  reduction  objectives  will  be  achieved  through\ndirect  improvement  in  incomes  for  project  participants  and\nincreased  employment  opportunities  for  nonparticipants,  brought\nabout  by  additional  farm  labor  requirements  and  increased\ndemand for transportation and processing.\n\nThe project scope will include (i) farmer training and extension, (ii)\nfarmer  mobilization  and  credit,  (iii)  adaptive  research,  (iv)\nmarketing  support,  (v)  a  pilot  credit \nfor  postharvest\nagribusiness support, and (vi) support for project management.\n\nline \n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $66.2  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  about  $19.5  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $46.7\nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n($ million)\n\n____________________________________________________\nPercent\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n_____________________________________________________\n  26.8\nADB\n    9.6\nGovernment\n  10.3\nBeneficiaries     0.0  \n\n46.3\n  9.6\n10.3\n\n  19.5\n    0.0\n\n70\n14\n16\n\n   Total\n  46.7\n____________________________________________________\n\n          100\n\n  19.5\n\n66.2\n\n\fLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nPeriod of\nUtilization\n\nExecuting\nAgencies\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\niv\n\nThe equivalent in various currencies of SDR 35,710,000 ($46.3\nmillion) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources, with a maturity of\n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest\ncharge  of  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter, to be paid semiannually.\n\nUntil 31 December 2008\n\n(i)  The  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE)  of  the\nMinistry of Agriculture\n\n(ii) Bangladesh Bank\n\nThe DAE will be the principal Executing Agency responsible for the\nimplementation  of  all  project  activities.  DAE  will  be  assisted  in\nproject implementation by the Department of Agricultural Marketing\n(DAM),  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED),\nand the selected NGOs.\n\nThe  Bangladesh  Bank  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and\nsupervising  the  credit  component.  It  will  channel  funds  to  the\nNGOs for crop finance operations and to the private entrepreneurs\nfor  agribusiness  pilot  activities.  Funds  will  be  routed  through  a\nfinancing  intermediary,  which  will  initially  be  the  Rajshahi  Krishi\nUnnayan Bank (RAKUB). The arrangement will be reviewed during\nthe  project  period  and  the  intermediary  changed  if  necessary  or\ndesirable.  The  NGOs  will  provide  and  supervise  crop  finance  to\nparticipating small-scale farmers.\n\nOverall  coordination  among  agencies  will  be  achieved  through  a\nproject  coordination  and  steering  committee  chaired  by  the\nSecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture. A project management unit\n(PMU)  will  be  established  in  DAE,  which  will  be  supported  during\nthe  project  period  with  a  team  of  international  and  domestic\nconsultants, and some equipment and vehicles. Field activities will\nbe  coordinated  and  monitored  by  two  project  supervision  units  to\nbe established in the region, under the regional additional directors\nof agriculture.\n\nAll procurement under the Project will be done in accordance with\nADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  including  local  competitive\nbidding.  The  major  items  to  be  procured  will  be  equipment,\nmaterials,  services,  and  a  modest  amount  of  civil  works.  All\nprocurement  will  generally  be  undertaken  by  the  PMU  after\nagreement  with  the  relevant  implementing  agency  on  the  scope,\nnature, and specifications of items to be procured.\n\n\fv\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n30 June 2008\n\nProject\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe  project  will  require  582  person-months  of  consulting  services\nconsisting of 124 months of international and 458 months of local\nexpertise.  Most  of  this  expertise  will  be  for  the  formulation  of  the\ntraining  programs  and  for  assistance  with  project  start-up  and\nmanagement.  All  consulting  services  will  be  engaged \nin\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nSince  specialized  expertise  will  be  required  for  formulating  and\nimplementing training courses, consultants for this component will\nbe  recruited  as  a  team  from  a  reputed  agriculture  training\ninstitution,  possibly \nin  combination  with  a  suitably  qualified\nconsulting  firm.    All  other  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  teams\nfrom  qualified  consulting  firms,  except  that  the  adaptive  research\nand  seed  verification  specialists,  because  of  the  nature  of\nexpertise required, will be recruited as individual consultants.\n\nProject  beneficiaries  comprise  about  160,000  farmers  who  own\nand  operate  0.2-1.2  hectares.  The  Project  will  increase  their\nincomes by an average of $78, or more than 24 percent, per year\nthrough  the  production  of  HVCs.  About  half  the  farmers  in  this\nlandholding  category  are  poor.  The  Project  will  thus  have  a\nimpact  on  poverty  reduction.  Field  activities  will\nsignificant \ngenerate about an additional 4.4 million labor-days of employment\nper annum.\n\nlosses  and  marketing  costs \n\nOther  benefits  arising  from  the  Project  but  not  quantified  include\nthrough\nreduced  postharvest \nimprovements to growers' markets, and increased production from\nfarmers  who  do  not  participate  in  the  Project  but  adopt  HVC\nproduction.  This  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  both  off-farm  and\non-farm  incomes  and  on  poverty  reduction.  Even  without  the\ninclusion  of  these  benefits,  the  Project\u2019s  economic internal  rate  of\nreturn is 30.7 percent.\n\nImplementation  risks  have  been  identified,  but  the  Project  has\nbeen designed with measures to mitigate them.  These measures\ninclude  (i)  the  requirement  that  all  farmers  taking  credit  packages\nhave  undergone  training  in  HVC  production,  (ii)  the  provision  of\nextension  support  by  DAE  and  the  NGOs  throughout  crop\nproduction  and  marketing,  (iii) \nfor  detailed\ncontracts between DAE and participating NGOs and the provision\nof a DAE-NGO Coordination Committee in the project design, (iv)\nthe  provision  of  consultants  to  assist  with  starting  the  project  and\nformulating  the  training  courses,  and  (v)  the  provision  for  project\nsupervision  units  for  project  coordination  and  supervision  at  field\nlevel.\n\nthe  requirement \n\n\fvi\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Northwest Crop Diversification Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe construction of the Jamuna bridge with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance\nin 19981 provided a road link between the northwest region and the rest of the country, ending\nthe physical isolation of one quarter of the country\u2019s population and opening a broad range of\neconomic opportunities. In FY1996, in anticipation of the completion of the bridge, ADB financed\na  study  to  investigate  the  development  potential  of  the  northwest  region.2  One  of  the  study\u2019s\nmain  recommendations  was  that  agriculture  development  become  one  of  the  major  strategies\nfor promoting economic growth and reducing poverty in the northwest region. On this basis, the\nstudy  was  followed  on  in  1999  by  technical  assistance  (TA)3  to  prepare  an  agriculture\ndevelopment project for possible ADB financing. The draft project preparation report for the TA\nwas submitted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Investment Center in April 2000\nand has been followed by a series of consultation and fact-finding missions. These culminated\nin an appraisal mission from 7 to 17 August 2000.4 During these missions the findings of the TA\nwere  reviewed  in  detail  with  representatives  of  the  government  at  central  and  field  levels,\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other funding agencies active in agriculture, and the\noriginal  proposal  was  refined  into  a  focused  investment  project.  This  report  summarizes  the\nfindings of the missions and is based on the recommendations of the original investment study;\nthe findings of the participatory rural appraisals; and extensive field visits and discussions with\nthe NGOs and the farmers in the region to understand their needs, priorities, and constraints. A\nlogical framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nThe Agriculture Sector\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3.\nBangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a gross domestic product\n(GDP) per capita of approximately $265. The population is approximately 120 million, with over\n800  people  per  square  kilometer,  making  it  also  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  densely  populated\ncountries.  Population  growth  has  declined  in  recent  years  to  just  below  2  percent  per  annum.\nAlthough  the  urban  population  is  growing  rapidly  by  migration  from  rural  areas,  Bangladesh\nremains primarily a rural society with over 80 percent of the population living in the rural areas.\nWith a high population density and a limited land base, poverty, and especially rural poverty, is\na  pervasive  problem.  A  recent  study  sponsored  by  ADB5  indicates  that  51  percent  of  rural\npeople are poor, whereas only 26 percent of urban people are poor in Bangladesh. The national\npoverty level is 46.5 percent. The study also noted that the overall progress in the reduction of\npoverty  was  slow  in  rural  areas.  Because  over  80  percent  of  the  country's  poor  live  in  rural\nareas, progress in reducing rural poverty continues to be the key challenge facing the country.\n\n                  \n\n1 Loan 1487-BAN: Jamuna Bridge, for $200 million, approved on 8 March 1994.\n2 TA 2545-BAN: Northwest Region Development and Investment Study, for $1.1 million, approved on 21 March\n\n1996.\n\n3 TA 3230-BAN: Northwest Agriculture Development, for $500,000, approved on 26 July 1999.\n4 Mission  comprised  P.  Dayal  (Mission  Leader),  E.  Araneta  (Counsel),  Edward  Breckner  (Agriculture  Specialist-\n\nConsultant), and Dennis Ellingson (Agriculture Economist-Consultant).\n\n5 Sen, Binayak. February 2000; Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions.\n\n\f2\n\nAgriculture  dominates  the  country\u2019s  economy  and  supports  the  vast  majority  of  the\n4.\ncountry\u2019s population, producing 32 percent of GDP and 23 percent of exports, and employing 60\npercent of the labor force. Within the agriculture sector, food crop production accounts for about\n75  percent  of  the  value  added.  An  estimated  9.3  million  hectares  (ha)  are  cultivated,  with  a\ncropping  intensity  exceeding  150  percent.  Rice  comprises  about  76  percent  of  the  cropped\narea, with other crops including pulses (5 percent); wheat (4 percent); jute (4 percent); oilseeds\n(4 percent); and the remainder (7 percent) producing vegetables, fruits, cotton, sugar, tea, and\nrubber. About 2.93 million ha or 31 percent of the cultivated land is irrigated. This includes large\nsurface irrigation systems (0.20 million ha), shallow tubewells, (1.16 million ha), low lift pumps,\n(0.64 million ha), deep tubewells (0.44 million ha), and traditional methods (0.44 million ha).\n\n5.\nBeside  crop  production,  other  agriculture-based  activities  include  livestock  production,\npond and capture fisheries, and forestry. The impact of these activities can be substantial, with\nlivestock  production,  for  example,  accounting  for  3  percent  of  total  GDP  and  10  percent  of\nagricultural GDP, and employment for 20 percent of the rural labor force. Livestock production\nand  fisheries  are  particularly  important  in  filling  the  income  gap  left  from  crop  production  and\nmay account for up to 50 percent of household incomes.\n\n6.\nBased on a rapid increase in irrigation using shallow tubewell technology, combined with\nthe use of high yielding rice varieties in the flood-free winter season, Bangladesh achieved near\nself-sufficiency in food production in the early 1990s, after many years of severe food deficits.\nSince  then,  the  Government  has  emphasized  sustained  growth  of  food  production.  The\nproduction  of  irrigated  winter  rice  crop  has  nearly  doubled  since  the  mid-1980s  and  now\naccounts for 40 percent of the country\u2019s total agriculture production.6 In contrast, the country\u2019s\nmain  cash crop,  jute has  had stagnant and even declining levels of production throughout the\n1990s.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  notable  increase  in  the  production  of  fruit  and\nvegetable crops and of fodder crops for a growing livestock industry.\n\n1. \n\nThe Northwest Region\n\n7.\nThe  northwest  region,  which  corresponds  administratively  with  the  Rajshahi  division,\ncomprises about one fifth of the country\u2019s land area and supports more than one quarter of the\ncountry\u2019s  population  (31.7  million).  Eighty-six  percent  of  the  population  is  rural,  which  is  the\nhighest  proportion  in  the  country  and  signifies  the  predominance  of  agriculture  in  the  region\u2019s\neconomy. Agriculture in the region is characterized by a large number of small holdings (below\n1 ha), traditionally focused on the production of rice. Since almost all available land is currently\nused  for  cultivation,  there  is  little  scope  for  an  increase  in  the  total  cropped  area.  Nonfarm\nemployment  opportunities  are  few  and  the  development  of  trade,  services,  and  industries  has\nbeen sparse. Poverty in the region is pervasive, with 62.2 percent of the population below the\npoverty  line,  a  figure  that  is  substantially  higher  than  the  national  average.  In  terms  of  human\npoverty indicators, Rajshahi division is noted for the lowest level of adult literacy, life expectancy\nat birth, and child immunization rate in the country. Much of this is because, until recently, the\nregion had been cut off from the rest of the country by the Ganges River to the south and the\nJamuna River to the east. This isolation has historically restricted the region\u2019s access to critical\ninputs,  markets,  and  technologies  and  has  resulted  in  its  slow  development  and  high  poverty\nlevels.\n\n8.\nDespite its current low status of development, the region is well suited to agriculture. It is\ncharacterized by relatively fertile, well-drained soils, ample ground and surface water resources\n\n                  \n\n6 ADB  has  contributed  significantly  to  this  growth  in  food  production  through  program  and  project  loans  that  have\n\nhelped to liberalize the sector and promote capital investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure.\n\n\f3\n\n(except in one area known as the Barind Tract), a varied climate that is favorable to a range of\ncrops  (allowing  the  region  to  produce  50  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  wheat),  and  relatively  flat\nterrain. More than 80 percent of the area is classified as medium to high lands, making it one of\nthe  least  flood  prone  regions  in  the  country  and  allowing  the  production  of  diversified  crops\nthroughout the year. Thus, the region has a significant comparative advantage for growing high\nvalue  crops  (HVCs),7  as  most  other  regions  of  the  country  are  flood  prone;  have  less  well\ndrained soils; and have a hotter, more humid climate. In particular, potential exists to produce\noff-season  fruits  and  vegetables,  which  could  be  marketed  at  high  prices  to  Dhaka  and  other\nparts of the country.\n\n9.\nThe  potential  for  further  investment  in  the  northwest  region  was  increased  with  the\nconstruction  of  the  Jamuna  bridge.  The  construction  of  this  major  transport  link  ended  the\nregion\u2019s  isolation  from  the  rest  of  the  country,  opened  access  to  markets  in  Dhaka  and  other\nurban  centers,  and  enhanced  access  within  the  region  to  modern  agricultural  inputs.  Future\ninvestment potential was investigated in detail through the Northwest Region Development and\nInvestment  Study,  (see  footnote  2)  approved  soon  after  the  bridge  construction.  The  study\nconcluded that \u201cfor economic development of the region to be successful there must be a strong\nagriculture  base\u201d.  It  also  highlighted  the  need  for  increased  rural  credit  and  for  such  credit  to\nreach small-scale farmers who constitute the largest segment of the farming community but are\nnot  served  by  commercial  or  NGO  financing  institutions.  The  study  further  pointed  out  the\npotential for new HVCs in the northwest region, due to its favorable agronomic environment and\nnew access to markets in the rest of the country.\n\n2.\n\nCrop  Production,  Diversification,  and  Market  Demand  in  the  Northwest\nRegion\n\na.\n\nCrop Production and Diversification\n\nThe northwest region covers a total of 3.45 million ha of which the cultivable area is 2.3\n10.\nmillion ha and the cropped area 4.0 million ha (at a cropping intensity of about 175 percent). Of\nthe  cultivated  area,  about  1.4  million  ha,  or  about  60  percent,  is  irrigated,  mostly  by  shallow\ntubewells installed within the last 10-15 years. The vast majority of the cropped area is planted\nto rice, the main \u201caman\u201d or wet season rice crop accounting for 1.8 million ha, the early or \u201caus\u201d\ncrop accounting for 238,000 ha, and the winter or \u201cboro\u201d crop accounting for 863,000 ha. Boro\nseason production, in particular, is associated with irrigation since it is the dry season. After rice,\nthe next major crop in terms of cropped area is wheat, which covers 366,000 ha and, like boro\nrice, is grown in the winter and depends heavily on irrigation. These two traditional crops (rice\nand wheat) thus take up 82 percent of the cropped area in the region, and, with other traditional\ncrops (jute, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane) make up over 90 percent of the cropped area. The\nbalance  is  used  for  HVCs:  vegetables  (50,000  ha),  spices  and  condiments  (39,000  ha),  fruit\n(46.000 ha), and root and tuber crops such as potato and taro (60,000 ha).\n\n11.\nThese HVCs, while accounting for only 5 percent of the total cropped area, give a higher\nreturn per hectare than boro rice and are the most promising crops for diversification. Until very\nrecently the incentive  to grow such  crops (despite their higher income return per hectare than\nrice) was offset by the farmers\u2019 priority for food security in the semisubsistence rural economy\nprevailing  in  the  region.  This  situation  is  now  changing  rapidly.  In  the  last  two  decades,  rice\n\n                  \n\n7 High value crops have been defined as any crop that provides higher net returns per hectare to the farmer than high\nyielding  winter  rice.  These  may  include  hybrid  maize;  potatoes;  vegetables  (onion,  cabbage,  eggplant,  tomato\npumpkin,  radish);  spices  (ginger,  chilies,  turmeric,  garlic  and  coriander;  and  fruits  (bananas,  papayas,  mangoes\nlychee).\n\n\f4\n\nproduction  in  Bangladesh  and  in  the  northwest  has  increased  dramatically  due  to  the\nwidespread  adoption  of  modern  technologies  and  the  use  of  minor  irrigation.  In  the  northwest\nalone, about 1 million ha have been brought into production during the dry season in the past\ntwo decades through the spread of minor irrigation. As a result, the region now produces a large\nrice surplus and supplies almost 3.0 million tons of unhulled rice annually to other parts of the\ncountry.\n\n12.\nThe  move  from  rice  deficit  to  surplus  has  been  accompanied  by  a  decline  in  the  real\nprice  of  rice.8    Rice,  for  many  farmers,  is  now  becoming,  at  least  in  part,  a  cash  crop  to  be\ntraded rather than an object of food security to be grown regardless of its comparative financial\nreturn.  A  further  transformation  in  crop  production  is  therefore  now  beginning  to  take  place.\nFarmers are starting to diversify to HVCs such as tubers, vegetables, and hybrid maize in place\nof rice as sources of cash income, thereby increasing their household\u2019s and the region\u2019s overall\neconomic productivity. At present this transformation is limited to a few areas, but the area for\nand production of such crops could increase significantly.\n\nb.\n\nMarket Demand\n\n13.\nBangladesh is a large net importer of agricultural produce. Recent trade statistics (1997)\nshow  imports  of  HVCs  and  derived  processed  produce  at  about  $50  million.  Substantial\nquantities  of  HVCs  and  seeds,  including  less  perishable  items  such  as  potatoes  and  spices,\nenter  from  neighboring  countries  into  the  northwest  region  and  other  parts  of  Bangladesh,\nindicating  a  significant  room  for  import  substitution  in  the  domestic  market.  The  economy  has\nexperienced  an  annual  growth  rate  of  4-5  percent  in  recent  years.  According  to  World  Bank\nstudies,9 most HVCs have income elasticities well above those for food grains and higher than\nfor pulses and oils. Based on population and income growth, the countrywide demand for HVCs\nis projected to rise from the current 4.0-5.0 million tons per annum to 5.4-6.5 million tons within\nthe next decade.\n\n14.\nStudies during Project preparation indicated that, while the opening of the Dhaka market\nby  the  Jamuna  bridge  will  provide  a  marketing  stimulus  for  HVCs  outside  the  region,  a  major\nunfulfilled demand for many HVCs exists in the project area. Based on current production levels\nand levels of import from bordering countries, the per capita consumption of fruit and vegetables\n(of  about  23.5  kilograms  per  annum)  is  only  about  one  third  of  internationally  accepted\nnutritional  requirements.  The  region  imports  significant  amounts  of  spices  and  condiments\nthrough  informal  cross  border  channels,  despite  growing  almost  40,000  ha  of  these  crops.\nDemand  projection  analysis  (based  on  projected  GDP  and  population  growth)  has  estimated\nthat  by  2007  the  regional  deficit  would  be  285,000  tons  of  potato,  400,000  tons  of  vegetables\nand  spices,  96,000  tons  of  edible  oils,  36,000  tons  of  fruit  and  120,000  tons  of  pulses.  The\ndemand  for  diversified  crops  in  the  northwest  region  will  thus  continue  to  exceed  supply  for\nsome time.\n\n15.\nOther factors will influence crop production and marketing in the future. First, the decline\nin rice prices is making the relative farm-level returns to cash crop production more attractive to\nfarmers. Second, the livestock industry is expanding and the demand for manufactured livestock\nfeed  is  likely  to  increase  substantially,  partially  contributed  by  the  ADB-financed  participatory\nlivestock development project,10 which is operating in the same area. Some NGOs have already\n\n                  \n\n8 PPA: BAN 22217: Food Crops Development Program, December 1999.\n9 World Bank. 1995.

While  agriculture  inputs  in  the  project  area  are  provided  almost  entirely  by  the  private\nsector on a commercial basis, most agriculture support services are provided by public sector\nline agencies. These include training and extension support from the Department of Agricultural\nExtension  (DAE);  research  activities  by  the  National  Agricultural  Research  System  (NARS);\nmarket  intelligence  and  development  by  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  (DAM);\nmarket  infrastructure  improvement  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)\nand agriculture credit by nationalized commercial banks, special agriculture banks and, recently,\nNGOs.\n\n17.\nDAE, and particularly its Field Services Wing, is quite a strong agency in the context of\nthe  Bangladesh  public  sector.    It  has  received  considerable  support  from  a  variety  of  external\nagencies, all aimed at providing an efficient, field-oriented crop production extension service. As\na  result,  a  relatively  well-trained  cadre  of  about  2,500  field  staff  supported  by  290  specialist\nextension  officers  and  123  subdistrict  agriculture  officers  are  available  in  the  project  area.\nMoreover,  DAE  wants  to  expand  its  outreach  and  capabilities  through  partnerships  with  other\nagencies  including  NGOs.  To  date,  DAE\u2019s  main  focus  has  been  the  promotion  of  improved\ntechnology in staple crops, principally rice and wheat, which reflects the Government\u2019s priorities.\nOf late, DAE has recruited horticulture specialists at the level of subdistrict officers to further the\npromotion of high value horticulture crops.\n\n18.\nAligned  with  and  supporting  DAE\u2019s  Field  Services  Wing  is  the  Food  Crops  Wing.    The\nFood  Crops  Wing  is  specifically  mandated  to  promote  horticultural  crops  and  operates  25\nhorticulture  training  and  demonstration  centers,  four  of  which  are  in  the  northwest  region.\nThese  centers,  developed  under  the  ADB-financed  Horticulture  Development  Project,11  have\nbeen providing training in horticulture production to landless and marginal farmers and technical\nsupport to the staff of the Field Services Wing.\n\nThe national agriculture research system in Bangladesh comprises the apex agency, the\n19.\nBangladesh Agriculture Research Council, and 10 government-operated research institutes. In\nkeeping with the country's historical priority on food security, much of the funding for agriculture\nresearch has been oriented to traditional staple crops, especially rice, although most research\nagencies have received significant international assistance and support.  Within the system, the\nBangladesh  Agriculture  Research  Institute  (BARI)  is  mandated  to  undertake  research  on\ncereals,  pulses,  tubers,  oilseeds,  vegetables,  fruit,  spices  and  condiments  through  its  15\nresearch divisions, 6 regional agriculture research stations, and 22 agriculture research centers.\nThe responsibility for the crops being specifically targeted by the Project is divided between the\nHorticulture  Research  Center,  the  Spice  Research  Center,  and  the  Tuber  Crops  Research\nCenter.  The  Spice  Research  Center  is  in  the  northwest  and  the  other  two  centers  have  their\nspecialized research stations in the region.\n\n20.\nDAM is responsible for overseeing the development of marketing in the country. Unlike\nDAE and NARS, DAM has received limited budgetary and external support has therefore lacked\nfacilities  and  resources  to  undertake  its  mandated  tasks.  As  a  result,  despite  having  an\nimportant  role  and  professionally  qualified  staff  through  to  district  level,  its  performance  is  not\n\n11 Loan 1010-BAN: Horticulture Development, for $22.6 million, approved on 21 December 1989.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nrated highly.  With the increasing focus on HVCs, efficient markets and timely market and price\ninformation  on  a  local  and  interregional  basis  will  increasingly  become  critical.  DAM,  which  is\nresponsible  for  information  collection  and  dissemination,  engages  it\u2019s  district  staff  for  this\npurpose but the output is largely used for statistical purposes. Still, the DAM staff constitute an\nexisting cadre of personnel who are involved in market research and can be equipped to deliver\ninformation to farmers and traders on current market prices and market prospects on a regional\nand  interregional  basis.  To  do  this,  DAM  will  need  considerable  institutional  strengthening\nthrough  role  redefinition,  staff  training,  basic  communication  and  information  technology,\nequipment, and budgetary support.\n\n21.\nThe market infrastructure improvement program that has been undertaken by the LGED\nfor  general  market  upgrading,  while  not  oriented  specifically  to  the  provision  of  facilities  for\nHVCs, has had a significant impact on improving market infrastructure efficiency through such\nmeasures  as  paving  access  roads,  improving  drainage,  providing  covered  sales  and  storage\nareas, and providing loading and unloading areas. More than 300 primary rural markets in the\nnorthwest  have  been  upgraded  and  handed  over  to  local  authorities  who  generally  contract\nthem out to private vendors for operation and maintenance.\n\n.\n22.\nThe northwest region is served by over 900 rural bank branches, including 300 branches\nof  the  Rajshahi  Krishi  Unnayan  Bank  (RAKUB),  a  specialized  agriculture  bank  focused\nexclusively  on  the  northwest  region.  Despite  this,  like  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  only  an\nestimated 10 percent of farm households have access to formal agriculture credit.  The banking\nsystem in the country, except for the foreign banks (which account for 5 percent of the system),\nis fragile, with capital adequacy levels below international norms, high levels of nonperforming\nloans, and low repayment rates. In contrast to the performance of the formal sector, a number of\nNGOs have demonstrated efficient delivery of microcredit in the project area and are beginning\nto enter the agriculture sector. However, the most notable characteristic of the agriculture credit\nsituation  in  the  country  and  in  the  northwest  is  that  the  bulk  of  the  small-scale  farmers  have\nbeen  missed  by  both  the  formal  sector  (the  banks)  and  the  semiformal  sector  (the  NGOs)\nbecause the NGO programs focus on the landless and marginal farmers and the banks require\ncollateral that only the large-scale farmers can provide. As a result, the farmers who have the\npotential to diversify do not have access to agriculture credit to help them to do so.\n\n4.\n\nNongovernment Organizations in Agriculture\n\n23.\nIn Bangladesh, about 1,500 NGOs are registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau, of which\nabout 1,000 have microfinance operations. Most of these are small local operations, but data of\n495 microfinance NGOs compiled by the Credit and Development Forum, a network of NGOs,\nindicates  (i)  a  total  network  of  11  million  households,12  (ii)  savings  mobilization  of  Tk14  billion\n($247 million), and (iii) loans outstanding of Tk29 billion ($568 million). Conservative estimates\nput the annual disbursement of these NGOs at Tk28 billion ($549 million). NGOs in Bangladesh\nthus play a major role in mobilizing rural finance and promoting development activities.\n\nDespite the large numbers of NGOs in the country, the 10 largest account for 90 percent\n24.\nof the membership and microfinance operations and the top 5 for 80 percent. These include the\nGrameen  Bank,  the  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  (BRAC),  The  Association  for\nSocial Advancement (ASA), Proshika Manavik Kendra (PROSHIKA), Thengamara Mohila Sabuj\nSangah (TMSS), Rangpur/Dinajpur Rural Services (RDRS), and the Grameen Krishi Foundation\n(GKF).  Two  of  these  agencies  (RDRS  and  GKF)  focus  principally  or  entirely  in  the  northwest.\n\n12 At an average of five persons per household, this would cover nearly 50 percent of the country\u2019s population.\n\n                  \n\n\f7\n\nLending  operations  of  these  NGOs  are  funded  by  (i)  members\u2019  savings;  (ii)  borrowings  from\nPalli  Karma  Sahayak  Foundation  (PKSF),  \u2014  NGO  apex  organization  on-lending  for  poverty\nreduction projects) and from banks, and (iii) internal accruals and foreign agencies.\n\nIn contrast to the performance of the agencies in the formal credit sector, the established\n25.\nNGOs have exhibited (i) pro-poor and marked gender orientation, 85 percent of members being\npoor  women;  (ii)  products  and  services  consistent  with  the  demand  profile  of  the  poor;  (iii)  an\nemphasis  on  savings;  (iv)  repayment  rates  of  well  over  90  percent;  (v)  interest  rates  on  loans\nthat reflect the cost of microfinance delivery (up to 30 percent); (vi) operating surpluses; and (vii)\nmotivated  staff.  Notwithstanding  their  impressive  achievements,  there  are  concerns  regarding\nsustainability,  inadequate  transparency,  and  a  high  dependence  on  donor  funds.  The\nGovernment has agreed to institute a regulatory regime for NGOs providing microfinance; ADB\nis providing support for instituting the regime.13\n\n26.\nSome microfinance borrowings from NGOs are used for subsistence agriculture and for\nshort-term cash crops.  However, in  the past, NGOs have been reluctant to specifically extend\nagriculture  credit  despite  the  fact  that  subsistence  agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the  rural\neconomy. This has been due to (i) their target group being primarily the landless and marginal\nfarming community; (ii) concerns about the politicization of agricultural credit; and (iii) their lack\nof  resources,  skills,  and  capacities  to  take  on  agricultural  lending.  Nonetheless,  several  of  the\nlarge  NGOs  are  now  moving  more  and  more  toward  agriculture-based  lending  and  are\nprogressively targeting small-scale farmers, many of whom are classified as poor.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n27.\nThe Government\u2019s fifth five-year development plan (1997-2002), which was released in\nMarch  1998,  sets  the  framework  for  agriculture  and  related  policies.  Other  key  documents\ninclude  the  National  Agricultural  Policy  (1999),  the  New  Agricultural  Extension  Policy  (1996),\nand  the  related  DAE  Strategic  Plan  (1999-2002).  With  regard  to  the  agriculture  and  rural\nsectors,  the  fifth  five-year  plan  emphasizes  (i)  the  alleviation  of  poverty  through  accelerated\neconomic  growth;  (ii)  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  of  the  rural  population  through\nmobilization  of  the  rural  masses  and  the  resources  at  their  command;  (iii)  attainment  of  food\nproduction  beyond  the  self-sufficiency  level  in  the  shortest  possible  time  and  of  higher\nproduction  of  diversified  high-value  produce;  and  (iv)  the  development  of  hitherto  neglected\nareas  like  the  northwest  region,  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts,  and  coastal  areas.  The\nmodernization  of  agriculture  is  to  be  attained  through  the  provision  of  extension  services,\ntraining, requisite inputs, and credit to farmers. Another major thrust will be increased irrigation\ncoverage,  better  water  management,  and  improved  varieties  of  seeds  for  rice  and  wheat.\nMoreover,  the  plan  envisages  a  major  effort  to  provide  adequate  marketing,  transport,  and\nstorage  facilities,  and  recognizes  the  increasing  dominance  and  potential  contribution  of  the\nprivate sector and the NGOs in agriculture.\n\n28.\nA  National  Agriculture  Policy,  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  April  1999,\nreiterates the need to intensify and diversify agriculture production. It emphasizes the increase\nin rice productivity through timely provision of inputs, a move to HVCs where feasible, and the\nprovision of credit to support both. Of particular note is the expressed intention of setting up an\nagricultural credit foundation (also called the Krishi Rin Foundation) following the PKSF model\nduring  the  fifth  five-year  plan.  This  would  act  as  an  apex  body  for  NGOs  providing  credit  for\nagriculture activities as opposed to the direct poverty related NGO activities of PKSF.\n\n13 TA  3078-BAN:  Establishment of the Framework for Sustainable Microfinance,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  29\n\n                  \n\nSeptember 1998.\n\n\f8\n\n29.\nThe New Agricultural Extension Policy emphasizes sustainable technologies, promotion\nof  research-extension  linkages,  and  inclusion  of  NGOs  and  the  private  sector  in  technology\ntransfer  to  farmers.  The  policy  envisages  a  major  role  for  DAE  in  all  aspects  of  extension  but\nrecognizes  the  need  for  developing  partnerships  with  NGOs,  other  government  extension\nproviders, the private sector, and education providers for both extension and research-extension\ncollaboration. It proposes the use of multiple extension approaches to facilitate rapid technology\ntransfer,  recognizes  the  potential  of  public  mass  media,  and  recommends  strengthening  the\nagriculture  information  system.  Within  DAE\u2019s  Strategic  Plan  2000,  extension  approaches  are\nbased on decentralization, responsiveness to farmers\u2019 needs, working with groups, and the use\nof a range of extension methods and partners.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n30.\nExternal assistance to the agriculture sector continues to be provided by ADB, the World\nBank, United Nations (UN) agencies, and bilateral agencies. Over the past decade or so, ADB's\nfocus  has  been  on  enabling  the  effective  functioning  of  the  sector,  initially  through  the\nFoodcrops  Development  Program  (FDP):14  and  subsequently  through  a  series  of  rural\ninfrastructure, water resource improvement, and microfinance projects. The rural infrastructure\nprojects  focused  on  the  provision  of  feeder  roads  and  markets,  the  water  resource\nimprovement,  projects  focused  on  the  provision  of  irrigation  as  a  critical  crop  input,  and  the\nmicrofinance projects aimed at supplying critically needed financial resources to the rural poor.\nIn  crop  diversification,  the  Horticulture  Development  Project  was  implemented  to  build  know-\nhow and capacities in service providers and homestead horticultural producers. The Project was\nsuccessfully  completed  in  1999  having  trained  over  70,000  farmers  in  horticulture  techniques\nand developed 25 horticulture training and demonstration centers (of which four are located in\nthe  northwest).  Relatedly,  the  ongoing  Participatory  Livestock  Development  Project  (PLDP)\naims at broadening the rural income base by supporting small and marginal farmers and women\nin subsistence livestock production.\n\n31.\nThe World Bank has provided major support to the sector through its Agriculture Support\nServices  Project  (ASSP),  which  provided  a  major  contribution  to  reorienting  the  focus  of  the\npublic  extension  system  and  formulating  the  New  Agricultural  Extension  Policy.  This  is  being\nfollowed up under the Agriculture Services Innovation and Reform Project (ASIRP), a learning\nand innovation loan, which is being cofinanced by the Department for International Development\n(DFID)  and  FAO  and  assisting  in  the  implementation  of  the  new  extension  policy.  The  World\nBank  has  also  been  active  in  developing  the  national  agriculture  research  system  through  a\nseries of agriculture research management projects.\n\n32.\nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  has  completed  the  first\nphase of support for an Agriculture Technology Development Project, in which it has supported\nagribusiness development through training and credit. A second phase of this project has been\napproved recently, and will commence in early 2001.\n\nSupport from bilateral agencies has been on either an individual basis or in collaboration\n33.\nwith multilateral banks. DFID, for example has been particularly active in supporting the ASSP\nand the ASIRP. The Government of Denmark has recently announced a Dkr486 million program\nof  agricultural  development  over  five  years,  which  includes  crops,  aquaculture,  and  livestock.\nThe  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  has  been  active  in  promoting  crop\ndiversification  and  some  success  has  been  achieved  with  potato.  The  experience  highlighted\n\n14 Loan 1045-BAN: Foodcrops Development Program, for $125 million, on 6 November 1990.\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\nthe  need  to  link  cropping  decisions  to  marketing  opportunities,  CIDA  has  recently  approved  a\nfollow-on  project,  the  Farm  to  Market  Enterprise  Development  Project.  Details  on  external\nassistance to the agriculture and rural development sector are given in Appendix 2.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nA  1997  study  of  postevaluated  projects  in  Bangladesh15  and  lessons  learned  from\n34.\nseveral  ADB-financed  agriculture  projects  highlight \ninstitutional\nstrengthening  to  ensure  institutional  capacity  and  competence  of  executing  agencies,  and  of\nregional  and  district  entities  and  beneficiary  groups;  (ii)  the  need  to  ensure  beneficiary\nparticipation as early as possible, in the design and implementation of the project, and in post-\nproject operation and maintenance (O&M); (iii) the need for effective sector analysis and project\npreparation prior to appraisal; (iv) the need for a flexible project implementation system based\non a process-oriented approach; and (v) the need to locate the project management team in the\nproject area, with mechanisms for regular contact with beneficiaries.\n\nimportance  of  (i) \n\nthe \n\nIn terms of lessons to be learned from specific Projects, the most relevant project is the\n35.\nPLDP. This project is similar in design to the proposed Project, covers the same project area,\nand  uses  the  same  NGOs.  The  latest  review  of  the  PLDP  indicates  that  implementation  is\nproceeding  smoothly,  with  the  NGOs  fulfilling  their  mandate  and  performing  well  within  target\nand levels of beneficiary organization, training, and credit provision. The Government-managed\ncomponents are also proceeding smoothly. The Horticulture Development Project, implemented\nby  DAE  (the  executing  agency  for  the  proposed  Project),  was  successfully  implemented  and\ncompleted  in  1999  although  implementation  took  several  years  longer  than  originally  planned.\nDelays  were  due  to  start-up  problems  and  difficulties  identifying  and  purchasing  large\ncontiguous  blocks  of  land  for  research  stations  and  horticulture  training  and  demonstration\ncenters development training centers. In terms of training in horticulture, the Project surpassed\nits  target,  training  over  70,000  landless  and  marginal  farmer  beneficiaries  as  opposed  to  an\nappraisal target of 60,000.\n\n36.\nPostevaluation  studies  revealed  that  people  living  within  the  influence  of  the  improved\ninfrastructure  obtained  access  to  agricultural  inputs  at  reduced  prices,  increased  their  use  of\nhigh-yielding  varieties,  enhanced  their  agriculture  production,  and  had  better  access  to  health\nand education facilities than prior to the project. Small-scale industries and trade activities also\nincreased. The Third Rural Infrastructure Project16 is currently being successfully implemented\nand a project preparatory TA for a fourth such project is programmed in the Bangladesh country\nassistance plan 2001.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n\nConsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  and  ADB\u2019s  medium-term\n37.\nstrategic  framework,  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  Bangladesh  identified\npoverty reduction as its overarching objective.17 This will be achieved by targeting four priority\nareas  (promoting  faster  private  sector-led  economic  growth,  creating  better  development\nopportunities  for  the  poor  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  improving  human  development,  and\nprotecting  the  environment)  in  15  subsectors.  In  the  agriculture  and  rural  sectors,  the  COS\nsupports  the  move  away  from  an  integrated  rural  development  approach  and  advocates\nsimplicity  of  implementation.  The  operational  focus  in  the  agriculture  and  rural  sectors  will  be\n\n                  \n\n15 Country Synthesis of Post-Evaluation Findings in Bangladesh, OEO, 1997.\n16 Loan 1581-BAN: Third Rural Infrastructure Project, for $70 million, approved on 20 November, 1997.\n17 ADB.

Bangladesh Country Operational Strategy: Responding to the Challenge of Poverty.\n\n\f10\n\nplaced on the crop, agrobusiness, and microfinance subsectors because the major constraints\ninhibiting  agricultural  growth  identified  in  the  COS  lie  in  these  subsectors.  These  constraints\ninclude weak rural development and extension support, lack of high quality planting materials,\nlarge unexploited irrigation potential and its suboptimal utilization, lack of effective rural financial\nservices  for  a  majority  of  small  and  marginal  farmers,  lack  of  marketing  channels,  and\npostharvest losses. The strategy in these subsectors is to enhance the capacity of the private\nsector  and  NGOs  to  provide  microcredit,  extension,  and  marketing  support  to  the  poor  for\nincreasing  crop  intensification  and  diversification,  and  agrobusiness.  The  strategy  also\nemphasized  the  role  of  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  in  providing  microcredit  and  rural\ninfrastructure  to  enhance  rural  nonfarm  growth  in  order  to  meet  the  financing  requirements  of\nsmall and medium enterprises.\n\nThe  poverty  reduction  objective  and  strategy  were  amplified  in  a  poverty  reduction\n38.\npartnership  agreement  recently  signed  between  ADB  and  the  Government.18  The  agreement\naimed  at  achieving  both  income  and  nonincome  aspects  of  poverty  reduction  in  the  medium\nterm through pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. An area approach is\nto be adopted to target assistance to areas of high poverty concentration. The strategy identified\nmeasures  to  enable  agricultural  growth  through  diversification  into  HVCs  and  noncrop\nagriculture,  research  and  extension,  improvement  of  small  and  medium  irrigation  systems,\nmicrofinance, storage and marketing, rural infrastructure, community development, and market\nliberalization  by  supporting  the  Government  in  hastening  reforms  to  create  an  environment\nconducive for greater private sector and NGO participation in rural areas.\n\n39.\nThe Project is consistent with the COS and the poverty reduction partnership agreement\nin that it aims at increasing agricultural growth to sustain higher income and poverty reduction of\nsmall-scale  farmers  through  improving  the  entire  cycle  of  diversification  to  HVCs  (including\ntraining  and  extension,  microcredit  provision,  adaptive  research,  and  marketing  support)  with\nsignificant  participation  by  NGOs  and  the  private  sector.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  adopt  an\narea approach by targeting the northwest region, which is the poorest area in the country.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nIn  close  coordination  with  the  World  Bank  and  other  agencies,  ADB  has  been  actively\n40.\ninvolved with the Government in agriculture sector policy dialogue for more than a decade. The\npresent  Project\u2019s  components  cut  across  three  subsectors  in  which  ADB  has  promoted  policy\nformulation and reform: microfinance, rural infrastructure, and agriculture input supply.\n\n1.\n\nMicrofinance Policies\n\n41.\nThe main concerns in microfinance include (i) ensuring sustainability and accountability\nof microfinance institutions, many of which are NGOs that depend on various funding sources\n(grants,  loans,  and  beneficiary  savings)  and  are  not  under  any  real  regulatory  supervision  or\ncontrol; and (ii) the need for microfinance institutions to better serve farmers in addition to rural\noff-farm  activities,  welfare,  and  subsistence  needs.  ADB  is  closely  involved  in  microfinance\nthrough its recently-approved Rural Livelihood Project.19 In addition, ADB is providing TA to help\nformulate  and  establish  a  sustainable  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  microfinance\n\n                  \n\n18 Based  on  TA  3339-BAN:  Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government of\n\nBangladesh, for $95,000, approved on 14 December 1999.\n\n19 Loan 1634-BAN: Rural Livelihood, for $42.6 million, approved on 29 September 1998.\n\n\f11\n\noperations.20 In relation to agriculture, most NGOs have focused primarily on off-farm activities\nfor  the  rural  landless  and  marginal  farmers.  The  Government  now  recognizes  the  need  to\nincrease the access of small-scale farmers to crop finance and to encourage NGOs to provide\nsuch  services.  It  has  thus  proposed  the  establishment  of  an  apex  organization,  the  Krishi  Rin\nFoundation  (KRF)  for  agriculture  financing  to  NGOs,  to  assist  in  their  transition,  to  build  their\ncapacities, and to supervise their operations on the lines of PKSF. KRF will be supported in the\ninitial  stages  with  financing  from  the  World  Bank  and  will  be  closely  monitored  by  ADB.\nProvision has been made to incorporate KRF as a financing channel for crop credit under the\nProject, after it has been evaluated and proven viable and effective.\n\n2.\n\nRural Infrastructure Policies\n\nADB  has  also  been  active  in  policy  dialogue  related  to  rural  infrastructure.  The  major\n42.\nissues relate to the need for functioning O&M systems and the need to ensure local participation\nin  the  selection  and  management  of  rural  infrastructure.  Directly  as  a  result  of  policy  dialogue\nwith  ADB,  the  Government  now  budgets  over  Tk1  billion  ($20  million)  annually  for  rural\ninfrastructure  maintenance.  However,  markets,  which  are  of  particular  concern  to  the  Project,\ncontinue  to  have  deficient  O&M.  Detailed  discussions  on  this  issue  during  project  preparation\nled the Government to agree to implement, with the Project\u2019s assistance, a variety of new O&M\nsystems to provide for greater local stakeholder participation and commitment for maintenance.\nThese  could  include  revisions  to  market  leases  to  make  their  terms  longer  than  the  current\nstandard  of  one  year,  a  division  of  lease  contracts  into  management  and  maintenance\nresponsibilities, and revision of the current practice of retaining the maximum of 25 percent of\nmarket incomes for maintenance. These will be implemented first in the markets to be improved\nunder the Project and will thereafter be replicated in the rest of the country.\n\n3.\n\nAgricultural Input Policies\n\nThe ADB\u2019s major policy involvement in the agriculture inputs subsector has most notably\n43.\nbeen through the FDP, which promoted growth in food crop production through the removal of\nmarket restrictions on minor irrigation equipment, fertilizer, and seed. The Project Performance\nAudit  Report  (PPAR)  rated  the  program  partly  successful;21  but,  from  the  point  of  view  of\nagriculture  production,  acknowledged  significant  increases  in  the  production  of  staple  rice  and\nwheat crops.\n\n44.\nOne of the FDP\u2019s major achievements that has led to this growth was the removal of all\nrestrictions  on  marketing  of  minor  irrigation  equipment.  Another  was  the  removal  of  the\nBangladesh  Agriculture  Development  Corporation  (BADC)  from  any  involvement  in  fertilizer\nmarketing and the freeing of fertilizer marketing for private sector operations. In addition, at the\ntime of the second tranche release, all fertilizer subsidies had been removed including those on\ndomestically-produced urea; and, when the second tranche was released, the Government was\nmoving to close all of BADC\u2019s retail seed outlets. Subsequently, however, subsidy on urea was\nreinstated and some retail seed outlets were continued.\n\n                  \n\nSeptember 1998.\n\n20 TA  3078-BAN:  Establishment of the Framework for Sustainable Microfinance,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  29\n\n21 The FDP was completed in June 1995, two years behind schedule, and ADB persistence was required to ensure\nsatisfactory compliance with Program measures prior to release of the second tranche in May 1994. The principal\nconcerns  noted  in  the  Project  Performance  Audit  included  the  mixed  performance  of  some  policy  measures;  the\nfailure  to  achieve  full  food  self-sufficiency;  and  questions  about  the  sustainability  of  reforms,  primarily  in  the\nfertilizer market.\n\n\f12\n\nTwo  unresolved  issues  are  relevant  to  the  present  Project.  First,  despite  the  end  of\n45.\nBADC\u2019s  role,  there  are  continuing  distortions  in  the  marketing  and  pricing  of  urea,  with  the\nprincipal concern being the economic subsidy that has grown as a result of rising world prices.\nSecond,  and  of  much  lesser  importance,  BADC  is  still  involved  on  a  limited  scale  in  retail\nmarketing of seed, despite having committed to terminate this under the FDPL.22 These issues\nare  subjects  of  continuing  policy  dialogue  in  close  coordination  with  the  World  Bank  which  is\npresently  processing  an  agriculture  sector  program  loan.  The  policy  issues  discussed  by  the\nMission and proposed actions are given in Appendix 3.\n\n46.\nIn  regard  to  urea,  the  paramount  objective  of  the  Government  is  to  ensure  a  secure\nsupply  at  stable  prices  throughout  the  country.  Therefore  in  1994-1995,  when  a  severe  urea\nshortage occurred in the country, the Government responded by appointing fertilizer dealerships\non the basis of specific geographic areas. Since then, no urea shortage had been reported. The\nGovernment  maintains  that  a  limited  public  sector  intervention  in  the  production  and  or\nmarketing  of  strategic  agriculture  inputs  is  critical  to  sustain  the  productivity  of  the  country\u2019s\nagriculture sector. It is clear that given the economic and political importance of urea, resolution\nof the subsidy issue will require continued dialogue and strong empirical evidence to support it.\nThe policy dialogue under the Project, therefore focused on controls imposed on urea marketing\nand  the  resultant  inefficiencies.  The  Government  agreed  to  reexamine  the  whole  question  of\nfertilizer  dealerships  and  consider  any  changes,  required  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  fertilizer\nsupply  to  farmers.  To  this  end,  the  Government  will  have  an  independent  and  comprehensive\nassessment of the fertilizer distribution system completed by 30 June 2001 and will inform ADB\nof the outcome and actions planned to be taken.\n\nIn  regard  to  seed,  the  Government\u2019s  view  is  that  a  retail  marketing  role  for  BADC  is\n47.\njustified to ensure a secure seed supply in areas of the country that are unlikely to be served by\nthe private sector. However, during the Project\u2019s preparation, the Government agreed to review\nthis role in light of the construction of the Jamuna bridge which has alleviated the isolation of the\nproject area. The Government has agreed to (i) complete a full review of the BADC retail seed\noutlets by 30 June 2001, and inform the ADB of the outcome and a timetable for further action;\nand to also (ii) review the mechanism for seed import, testing, and approval in order to identify\ninefficiencies  and  suggest  streamlined  procedures  that  will  encourage  greater  private  sector\nparticipation and improve the flow of new seed varieties into the country by 31 December 2001.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\n48.\nThe northwest is one of the Bangladesh's poorest and most backward regions despite its\nfavorable natural resources. It has traditionally been at a disadvantage compared to other parts\nof  the  country  due  to  its  physical  isolation,  which  has  been  partly  alleviated  by  the  Jamuna\nbridge and additional infrastructure investments under way to improve road links from the bridge\nto  Dhaka  and  into  the  heartland  of  the  northwest.23  These  developments  have  presented  new\nopportunities for increasing agriculture production and the incomes of much of the population of\nthe  region.  Moreover,  the  area  has  good  potential  for  agriculture  (para.  8)  and  scope  for\ndiversification  away  from  traditional  crops.  Although  there  is  little  scope  for  expansion  or\nintensification  of  traditional  crops,  farmers  could  increase  their  incomes  by  raising  crops,  that\n\n                  \n\n22 At  present,  BADC  accounts  for  less  than  7  percent  of  the  domestic  seed  trade.  Moreover,  with  the  exception  of\npotato, full private sector participation is expected in all areas of seed imports and marketing for the crops to be\npromoted under the Project.\n\n23 Loan1478-BAN: Jamuna Bridge Access Roads, for $72 million, approved on 5 November 1996.\n\n\f13\n\ncan provide a greater value per unit area than can high yielding varieties of rice. There is ample\nscope to do this without affecting the region\u2019s or the households\u2019 food security.\n\n49.\nIn addition to the physical isolation, other factors have limited agriculture development in\nthe past, constrained diversification away from traditional crops to HVCs, and thus kept incomes\nin  the  region  low  and  stagnant.  These  include  lack  of  knowledge  of  appropriate  crops  and\nvarieties on the part of the farmers; a dearth of information on markets and market potentials for\nnontraditional  crops;  most  importantly,  difficulties  in  accessing  production  credit,  especially  for\nsmall-scale farmers, to experiment with new crops and technologies; inadequate focus of public\nresearch  and  extension  on  crops  other  than  rice;  and  limited  participation  of  NGOs  and  the\nprivate sector in agriculture support services.\n\nThe  Project  was  thus  designed  to  break  the  low  income  cycle  by  focusing  on  HVC\n 50.\nproduction and addressing many of the identified constraints. In this way, the Project will be able\nto  reach  a  large  number  of  small-scale  farmers  (men  and  women),  provide  them  with  the\ninformation  and  knowledge  needed  to  diversify  to  new  HVCs,  provide  them  with  the  financial\nresources  to  purchase  inputs  and  equipment,  and  assist  them  in  marketing  their  produce  at\nbetter  prices.  This  will  have  an  overall  beneficial  impact  on  the  participating  farmers  and  the\nregion's  economy  as  a  whole;  on  the  labor  market,  due  to  increased  labor  demand;  and  on\noverall regional nutrition as new and more nutritious vegetables and fruits become available at\naccessible prices.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  diversifying  crops  in  the  northwest  region  to  increase  regional\n51.\nand  farm  incomes  and  thereby  alleviate  poverty.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  promote\nproduction  and  more  efficient  marketing  of  HVCs  and  to  build  sustainable  partnerships  and\ncapacities of NGOs and the public sector agencies in order to provide extension, training, and\ncredit support to the small-scale farmers. Poverty reduction objectives will be achieved through\ndirect improvement in incomes for project participants and increased employment opportunities\nfor nonparticipants, brought about by additional farm labor requirements and increased demand\nfor transportation and processing.\n\n52.\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  base  on  extensive  consultations  with  the  farming\ncommunity, NGOs, and agriculture service providers. It takes into account a holistic assessment\nof  the  farming  systems  in  the  project  area  that  includes  issues  such  as  labor  availability,  risk-\naverse  behavior  of  smallholders,  and  social  and  gender  considerations.  The  Project  will  cover\nall  16  districts  of  the  northwest  region,  but  will  be  limited  to  the  60  subdistricts  (out  of  127)\nhaving  the  highest  potential  for  diversification  to  HVCs.  The  list  of  agreed  subdistricts  is  a\nsupplementary appendix (available on request) to this report.\n\nThe target group of this project is the small-scale farmers,24 both men and women. Out\n53.\nof 3.2 million farm households in the northwest, 1.9 million are smallholders and they constitute\nthe  largest  segment  of  the  farming  community.  About  half  of  these  small-scale  farmers  are\npoor25  and  the  rest  are  highly  susceptible  to  downward  social  mobility.26  This  group  has  been\ntraditionally overlooked by government and NGO agriculture service providers. Their access to\nproduction  credit  has  been  sparse  as  NGOs  have  focused  on  the  landless  and  the  nonfarm\nsector  and  the  formal  sector  has  neglected  them  because  of  inadequate  collateral.  Yet,  this\n\n                  \n\n24 Farmers with landholdings of 0.2-1.2 ha.\n25 World Bank. 1998. (Bangladesh: Counting the Poor and Making the Poor Count), notes that up to 70 percent of\n\nsmall farmers and 32 percent of medium-scale farmers are poor.\n\n26 Hossain Zillur Rehman, 1995. Crisis and Insecurity, the other Face of Poverty.\n\n\f14\n\ngroup has the land resources to try out new crops and cropping patterns and has demonstrated\ninitiative in the project area to diversify cropping. The Project will support this process and focus\non the small-scale farmers to promote HVC production, and will encourage women farmers to\nactively participate in the Project.\n\n54.\nThe  Project  will  have  six  components:  (i)  farmer  training  and  extension,  (ii)  farmer\nmobilization  and  credit  support,  (iii)  adaptive  research,  (iv)  marketing  support,  (v)  pilot\nagribusiness credit line for post-harvest activities, and (vi) support for project management.\n\n1.\n\nFarmer Training and Extension\n\n55.\nThe  Project  will  finance  training  in  HVC  production  and  marketing  through  a  three  tier\ntraining process: (i) technical training for personnel of DAE and interested participating NGOs,\n(ii) institutional training for farmers interested in HVC production, and (iii) village-based training\nfor  farmer  participants  unable  to  attend  institutional  courses.  Staff  training  and  institutional\nfarmer  training  will  be  provided  at  the  four  existing  horticulture  training  and  demonstration\ncenters (HTDCs) constructed under ADB\u2019s Horticulture Development Project and other training\nfacilities identified in the region, including those operated by NGOs. The training facilities will be\nupgraded  as  necessary.  The  Project  will  finance  the  expansion  of  training  centers  where\nnecessary, and the development of (i) training programs for farmers and for staff responsible for\ntraining  and  extension,  (ii)  comprehensive  visual  technology  packages  for  HVCs  to  be\ndisseminated through village-based extension, and (iii) extension support from DAE and NGOs.\n\n56.\nAbout  200,000  farmers  will  participate  in  training  programs  over  the  project  period,\nthrough institutional and village-based training programs. Since the objective is to demonstrate\nnew  cropping  opportunities  in  the  project  area  and  equip  the  identified  farming  community  to\nimplement it, the Project will finance the full costs of farmer training in the first three years of the\ntraining program. Options to sustain the training and extension support beyond the project life\nwill  be  assessed  and  finalized  during  the  midterm  review.  These  could  include  contracting  or\nleasing out of all or some training facilities to interested NGOs and the private sector or charging\nof trainees, including NGO staff and farmer participants.\n\nThe training courses will be aimed at small-scale farmers and thus will focus on HVCs to\n57.\nbe identified by the DAE and NGOs. The HVCs could include field crops such as potato, hybrid\nmaize, legumes, and spices; fruit such as bananas and papayas; and vegetable.\n\n2.\n\nFarmer Mobilization and Credit Support\n\n58.\nFour  major  NGOs  with  extensive  experience  in  farmer  mobilization,  experience  in  the\nnorthwest,  and  (in  some  cases)  experience  in  HVCs  have  indicated  their  willingness  to\nparticipate  in  the  Project  in  partnership  with  DAE.  These  are  BRAC,  GKF,  PROSHIKA,  and\nRDRS (Appendix 4). These NGOs all have large memberships, handle large volumes of credit\nannually,  and  have  sound  and  trustworthy  management.  BRAC,  for  example,  has  over  3.3\nmillion members and handled a credit program of Tk7.1 billion ($140 million) in 1998. Similarly,\nPROSHIKA has 1.4 million members and disbursed Tk2.8 billion ($54 million) in 1998. Both are\nalready  engaged  in  contracted  seed  production  and  HVC  programs  with  farmers.  GKF  and\nRDRS are smaller, but both have extensive experience in the northwest and have been working\non promoting agriculture.\n\n59.\nDAE and NGOs will be jointly responsible for publicizing the Project among small-scale\nfarmers  and  identifying  potential  participants  through  participatory  assessments  and  self\n\n\f15\n\nselection  by  qualifying  interested  farmers.  The  NGOs  will  facilitate  the  formation  of  farmer\ngroups  for  training  and  credit.  About  $16  million27  of  credit  will  be  coursed  through  the  NGOs\nduring the project period to finance the short-term credit requirements of the project participants.\nCredit demand has been estimated on the basis that, on the average, each participating farmer\nwill  grow  0.25  ha  of  HVCs.  About  160,000  trained  farmers  are  likely  to  opt  for  the  credit\npackages.28  Given  the  NGOs\u2019  current  levels  of  lending  and  farmer  mobilization  this  is\nconsidered to be well within their capabilities.\n\nSince  each  NGO  has  its  own  means  of  mobilizing  farmers  and  providing  credit,  the\n60.\nProject  will  not  prescribe  any  change  in  their  practices  and  procedures  other  than  to  focus\nproject activities on the identified HVCs and on the small-scale farmer target groups.\n\n3.\n\nAdaptive Research\n\n61.\nFor many of the HVCs to be promoted by the Project, available technologies will allow\nmuch  higher  yields  to  be  achieved  than  with  traditional  varieties  and  traditional  techniques.\nHowever, data on such technologies need to be consolidated and some of technologies need to\nbe tested and adapted to conditions prevailing in the northwest. To support the field extension\nand  training  program,  improve  access  to  better  technologies,  and  ensure  the  supply  of  high\nquality planting materials for a wide variety of HVCs, the Project will support adaptive research\nby  various  research  agencies  (Bangladesh  Agriculture  Research  Institute  [BARI],  universities,\nthe private sector, NGOs) throughout the northwest.\n\n62.\nActivities to be financed under the adaptive research program will be (i) the preparation\nof  an  electronic  data  bank  on  HVC  varieties  and  technologies  through  the  identification  and\ncompilation of existing research results in Bangladesh research institutions and the identification\nand  procurement  of  relevant  existing  technologies  and  HVC  varieties  from  international\nresearch  centers;29    (ii)  the  provision  of  some  funding  to  horticulture  research  facilities  in  the\nregion; and (iii) adaptive research carried out on a contract basis by suitable research agencies.\nThe  topics  for  adaptive  research  contracts  will  be  based  on  proposals  received  from  the  field\nextension workers. Mechanisms for research-extension collaboration and farmer participation in\nfarm  trials  and  demonstrations  will  be  detailed  in  the  contracts  to  be  awarded  by  the  project\nmanagement unit (PMU).\n\n4.\n\nMarketing Support\n\nA  key  aspect  of  the  promotion  of  HVC  production  will  be  assistance  for  improved\n63.\nmarketing. While a market for high value produce already exists in the region, support is needed\nto  provide  farmers  with  up-to-date  price  information  so  they  can  maximize  their  returns  and\nincrease  output  with  better  quality  standards.  Marketing  support  will  have  two  elements:  (i)\nstrengthening  DAM  to  allow  it  to  collect,  collate,  and  disseminate  accurate,  dependable  and\ntimely  information  on  the  prices  and  demand  for  HVCs;  and  (ii)  renovating  and  upgrading\nprimary village markets and providing model growers' markets in areas producing large volumes\nof HVCs.\n\n64.\nSupport will be provided to DAM (in the form of consultancies and training) to assist it (i)\nto  develop  a  market  information  strategy  and  train  its  staff  to  implement  the  strategy,  (ii)  in\ndeveloping market information and broadcast modules, and (iii) in financing market broadcasts\n\n                  \n\n27 Base cost.\n28 On project completion, this will result in at least 40,000 ha of incremental cultivation of HVCs.\n29 Such as: Asian Vegetable Research Development Centre (AVRDC), International Centre for Research in Semi-Arid\n\nTropics (ICRISAT), and International Centre for Potato (CIP).\n\n\f16\n\nduring  the  project  period.  A  strengthened  DAM  will  disseminate  market  information  to  a  wide\naudience  throughout  the  region  through  regular  market  radio  broadcasts,  providing  current\nmarket prices and trading volumes.\n\nSixty  primary  village  markets  will  be  renovated  and  upgraded  in  subdistricts  producing\n65.\nlarge volumes of HVCs and where the Project is active. In addition, 16 large growers' markets30\nwill be constructed throughout the region consisting of one market per district, each in an area\nof  existing  or  potential  HVC  production.  Markets  will  be  provided  with  loading  and  unloading\nareas, covered areas for produce display and storage, a fresh water supply, and sanitation and\nwaste  disposal  facilities.  To  promote  efficient  operation  of  the  upgraded  market  facilities,  the\nProject  will  finance  a  market  management  study  and  implement  more  efficient  market\nmanagement  systems.  This  subcomponent  will  assess  other  market  management  systems\noperating  in  the  neighboring  countries  especially  for  HVCs,  formulate  adaptable  models,  and\nassist in their implementation and evaluation.\n\n5.\n\nPilot Agribusiness Credit Line\n\n66.\nThe  production  of  increased  levels  of  HVCs  under  the  Project  is  likely  to  increase\nrequirements for postharvest storage, processing, and transport enterprises. At the same time,\nan expansion of such enterprises in the project area will act as a stimulus to farmers diversifying\nto  HVCs  by  expanding  the  size  and  nature  of  the  markets  available  to  them.  Additional  cold\nstorage, feed mills, and vegetable and fruit processing plants, for example, could allow farmers\nto grow larger volumes of high value produce and to choose a broader range of crops.\n\n67.\nOne  impediment  to  the  establishment  of  agribusiness  enterprises  has  been  limited\naccess to credit, especially for private and individual entrepreneurs interested in medium-sized\nventures.  ADB \nis  considering  an  agribusiness  development  project  preparatory  TA,\nprogrammed  for  2003.  This  major  thrust  to  support  medium-sized  agribusiness  could  help\nalleviate  many  of  the  constraints  being  faced  by  medium-sized  entrepreneurs  and  provide\ntechnical  and  institutional  support  for  the  new  entrants.  In  this  context,  at  the  request  of\nGovernment, a pilot credit line has been included in the Project to test the feasibility and viability\nof  some  representative  enterprises  and  the  implementation  and  institutional  arrangements  for\nagribusiness lending. This component will also help stimulate the market for agricultural produce\nwithin the project area and provide guidance in designing the forthcoming agribusiness loan.\n\n68.\nThe  credit  line  of  about  $1.0  million  will  be  on-lent  through  RAKUB,  a  bank  that\nspecializes in agriculture exclusively in the northwest region. This pilot activity will focus on the\nestablishment  of  downstream  agribusinesses  in  the  region  in  order  to  support  the  HVC\nproduction  under  the  Project.  Activities  to  be  supported  will  include  cold  storage,  feed  mills,\npacking and packaging enterprises, seed processing and storage, and specialized transport for\nHVCs. The technology for all of these enterprises is available in the country.\n\n6.\n\nProject Management Support\n\n69.\nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  within  DAE  to  supervise  overall\nProject implementation and monitoring. The PMU will be supported with necessary equipment,\ntransport,  and  a  team  of  national  and  international  consultants  to  guide  and  support  project\nactivities.  Two  regional  project  coordination  and  supervision  units  will  be  established,  one  at\nRajshahi  and  one  at  Rangpur.  The  units  will  oversee  operations  in  the  field  and  interact  with\nbeneficiaries.  Project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  each  implementing\nagency and operational support will be provided to them through the Project.\n\n30  Wholesale markets where traders purchase HVCs in high volumes from farmers and traders.\n\n                  \n\n\f17\n\n4.9\n5.2\n2.6\n0.4\n1.0\n1.7\n15.8\n\n0.5\n1.9\n2.4\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n70.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $66.2 million equivalent including about $2.2\nmillion for taxes and duties.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan\nof  $46.3  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  70  percent  of  the  total\ncost of the Project. The loan will finance $19.5 million equivalent of the foreign exchange costs\nand $26.8 equivalent in local currency costs. The remaining project costs, amounting to $19.9\nmillion, will be met by other sources including the Government ($9.6 million) and beneficiaries\n($10.3 million). The loan will have a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8\nyears, and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and\n1.5 percent thereafter. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. The foreign\nexchange risk for the loan proceeds will be borne by the Borrower.\n\n72.\nThe Project has a high local cost component because it aims at developing the poorest\nregion of Bangladesh by enhancing the region's capacity to produce and market HVCs. Thus, a\nlarge  portion  of  investment  is  needed  to  improve  research  and  extension  programs,  farmers'\ntraining,  microfinance,  and  marketing  facilities;  all  of  which  require  local  cost  items.  Given  the\ncountry's weak financial position with overall lack of domestic budgetary resources in the sector,\nmuch of the local cost of the Project must be financed externally to avoid increasing pressure on\nthe  Government  budget.  As  such,  ADB  assistance  for  local  cost  financing  for  this  Project  is\nconsidered justified.\n\n\fTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\n18\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n26.8\n9.6\n10.3a\n46.7\n\nTotal\nCost\n46.3\n9.6\n10.3\n66.2\n\nPercent\n\n70\n14\n16\n(100)\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n19.5\n0.0\n0.0\n19.5\n\nADB\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n     Total\na Consisting of farmer and paid labor.\nSource: Mission estimates.\n\nE.\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\n1.\n\nThe Department of Agricultural Extension\n\nincluding \n\nin  execution  of  similar  Projects, \n\n73.\nDAE  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  will  be  the  principal  Executing  Agency.  DAE  has\nthe  ADB-financed\nconsiderable  experience \nHorticulture Development Project and the Command Area Development Project. DAE has also\nhad  a  major  role  in  the  seminal  Agriculture  Support  Services  Project  and  the  Agriculture\nServices  Innovation  and  Reform  Project.  Both  projects  were  financed  by  DFID  and  the  World\nBank,  and  have  been  instrumental  in  bringing  about  a  major  reform  of  the  provision  of\nagriculture support services in the country. DAE is currently managing 35 projects, of which 13\ninvolve bilateral or multilateral funding. The agency is essentially a field organization with most\nof its staff consisting of 10,500 extension block supervisors stationed in the 468 subdistricts of\nthe  country,  supported  by  5  specialist  officers  in  each  subdistrict.  DAE  also  manages  the\nHTDCs provided under the Horticulture Development Project. While previously somewhat wary\nof  NGOs  and  the  private  sector,  DAE\u2019s  new  strategic  plan  recognizes  its  limitations  as  a\nGovernment  agency  and  envisages  close  cooperation  with  NGOs  and  the  private  sector  in\nextension  activities.  This  is  already  being  put  into  practice,  particularly  with  NGOs  involved  in\nagriculture.\n\n2.\n\nBangladesh Bank\n\n74.\nBangladesh Bank will be the second executing agency and will manage the funds for the\ncredit  components  of  the  Project.  Bangladesh  Bank  serves  as  the  country's  central  bank,  and\nthus  is  ultimately  responsible  for  credit  refinancing  and  supervision  of  the  country's  financial\ninstitutions. The apex channeling agency for NGOs (PKSF) did not wish to extend its scope to\ninclude  agriculture  and  the  small  farmer  category.  The  new  apex  NGO  agency  for  agriculture,\nthe  Krishi  Rin  Foundation  (KRF)  is  not  yet  established,  the  financial  status  of  the  banking\ninstitutions in the country was considered unsatisfactory, and the financial intermediation by the\nNGOs in the Project is an innovation that will need to be monitored. This arrangement was also\nconsidered appropriate because it will allow for a change in the on-lending agency, if necessary\nor  desirable  during  project  implementation.31  The  Agriculture  Credit  Project  Department  of\nBangladesh Bank is familiar with the requirements of implementing externally-assisted projects\nand  has  been  involved  in  several  ADB-financed  Projects,  including  (i)  the  Northwest  Rural\n\n                  \n\n31 This would accommodate, for example, the use of the proposed NGO agriculture financing apex organization, the\n\nKrishi Rin Foundation, as an implementing agency during the latter part of the Project.\n\n\f19\n\nDevelopment  Project,32  (ii)  the  Second  Aquaculture  Development  Project33  and  (iii)  the\nNortheast Minor Irrigation Project.34\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Management\n\n75.\nThe  proposed  project  management  structure  is  given  in  Appendix  6.  The  principal\nExecuting Agency for the project, DAE, will be assisted in project implementation by two other\nImplementing  Agencies:  DAM,  and  the  LGED  of  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  and  Local\nGovernment. In addition, several NGOs will have a central role in the Project as part of a public-\nprivate partnership with the DAE. The four participating NGOs: (BRAC, GKF, PROSHIKA, and\nRDRS)  will  be  responsible  for  providing  credit  packages  to  project  beneficiaries  and  will  work\nwith  DAE  in  the  mobilization,  training,  and  provision  of  post-training  extension  support  to\nparticipating  farmers.  As  the  principal  executing  agency,  DAE  will  be  responsible  for  overall\nproject  management  and  execution.  It  will  be  specifically  responsible  for  implementing  the\nextension  and  training  component  through  its  Food  Crops  and  Field  Services  wings,  in\npartnership  with  the  participating  NGOs.  DAE  will  also  be  responsible  for  implementing  the\nadaptive  research  component.  DAM  will  implement  the  market  information  and  the  market\nmanagement subcomponents, while LGED will implement the provision of market infrastructure\n(primary  and  grower  markets),  working  in  conjunction  with  DAE,  DAM,  and  the  relevant  local\nlevel authority (district, subdistrict, municipality, or groups of villages as the case may be).\n\n76.\nBangladesh  Bank  will  be  responsible  for  relending,  supervision,  and  monitoring  of  the\ncredit  funds  to  participating  NGOs;  the  pilot  agribusiness  credit  line;  and  management  of  the\nrevolving  funds  for  credit  repayments  from  the  NGOs  and  the  agricultural  entrepreneurs.\nBangladesh Bank will be assisted by RAKUB to channel funds to the NGOs and administer the\npilot  credit  line.  A  channel  was  necessary  because  the  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  charter  does  not\nallow it to directly on-lend funds to NGOs. RAKUB is a suitable agency for this task since it is,\nby  mandate  and  charters  an  agriculture  development  bank  focusing  on  the  northwest  region.\nFurther  or  alternative  channeling  agencies  may  be  selected  by  agreement  between  the\nGovernment and ADB if considered necessary or desirable during project implementation.\n\n2.\n\nInteragency Coordination\n\n77.\nOverall  coordination  among  agencies  will  be  achieved  through  a  project  coordination\nand steering committee chaired by a secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and consisting of all\nagencies involved in the Project plus the Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance,\nthe Planning Commission, the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry\nof  Planning  and  a  representative  of  the  Divisional  Commissioner  of  Rajshahi  Division.  This\ncommittee  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  to  discuss  the  progress  of  project  implementation,\nresolve \nto  project\nmanagement.\n\ninteragency  coordination,  and  provide  overall  guidance \n\nissues  of \n\n78.\nTo provide smooth operation of the farmer mobilization, training, and credit component a\nDAE-NGO  coordination  committee  will  be  established.  This  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the\nhead of the PMU and will consist of representatives from the DAE PIU, each participating NGO,\n\n                  \n\n32 Loan 615-BAN: Northwest Rural Development Project, for $45.0 million, approved on 14 November 1982.\n33 Loan 821-BAN: Second Aquaculture Development Project for $45.46 million, approved on 16 December 1986.\n34 Loan 1125-BAN: Northeast Minor Irrigation, for $73.0 million, approved on 21 November 1991.\n\n\f20\n\nand  RAKUB.  The  terms  of  operation  for  this  committee  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  in\ncooperation with the participating NGOs, within six months of loan effectiveness.\n\n79.\nAn interagency coordinating body is necessary to ensure that all involved agencies, the\nPMU,  DAM,  LGED,  and  local  authorities  participate  fully  in  the  planning,  execution,  and\noperation of the marketing component. Market committees will thus be set up for this purpose in\neach subregion covered by a regional project supervision unit (PSU). These committees will be\nchaired by the regional head of PSU and will consist of representatives from DAM, LGED, local\nauthorities in the districts covered by the PSU, and representatives of market vendors. Terms of\noperation  of  the  market  committees  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness.\n\n3.\n\nProject Management Unit\n\n80.\nDay-to-day project supervision will be through a PMU set up within DAE headquarters in\nDhaka. DAE is the appropriate location for the PMU since the intent and direction of the Project\nis very much within the mandate and purview of DAE and its operations. A Dhaka-based PMU is\nappropriate  in  view  of  the  need  for  the  PMU  and  its  staff  to  liaise  with  a  number  of  agencies\u2019\nhead offices.\n\nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) planning, budgeting, supervising, and monitoring the\n81.\nproject implementation work of all public sector implementing agencies (DAE, DAM, LGED, and\nthe  contracted  research  agencies);  (ii)  entering  into  and  monitoring  contracts  and  agreements\nwith the NGOs with relation to farmer mobilization, for credit provision and follow on extension\nsupport;  (iii)  in  cooperation  with  Bangladesh  Bank,  monitoring  the  flow  of  credit  to  NGOs,\nfarmers,  and  private  entrepreneurs;  (iv)  procuring  equipment  and  recruiting  consultants  for  all\ncomponents; \nfunds,  commitments,  disbursements,  and\nreimbursements; and (vi) liaising with ADB.\n\n(v)  accounting \n\nfor  all \n\nloan \n\n82.\nThe  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time,  experienced,  senior  project  director,  to  be\nappointed  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and  will  comprise  five  units:  (i)  budget,  planning,  and\ncoordination  with  ADB;  (ii)  interagency  coordination;  (iii)  procurement;  (iv)  accounting;  and  (v)\nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Each  unit  will  be  headed  by  competent  staff  of  adequate  seniority\nand experience.\n\n83.\nFor  effective  project  implementation  and  coordination  with  the  PMU,  appropriately\nstaffed project implementation units (PIUs) will be set up within the executing and implementing\nagencies.  This  will  entail  PIUs  in  Bangladesh  Bank,  DAE,  DAM,  LGED,  RAKUB,  and  each\nparticipating  NGO.  In  addition,  to  ensure  a  field-level  presence  for  project  supervision  and\ncoordination, two regional PSUs will be set up, one at Rajshahi and one at Rangpur, each under\nthe regional additional director of agriculture. These units will be responsible for overseeing and\ncoordinating project implementation in the field and will work under the guidance of the PMU.\n\n84.\nThe PIUs will be responsible for the individual day-to-day implementation of the project\ncomponents  and  for  reporting  progress  under  these  components  to  the  PMU  and  will  be\nestablished within one month of loan effectiveness.\n\n\f21\n\n4.\n\nSpecific Implementation Arrangements\n\na.\n\nFarmer Training and Extension Component\n\ni.\n\nFormulation of Training Courses\n\n85.\nDAE\u2019s  Food  Crops  Division,  under  the  supervision  of  the  PMU,  will  be  responsible  for\nthe  formulation  of  training  programs  suitable  for  promoting  HVC  production.  Several  types  of\ntraining  courses  will  be  developed.  These  will  include  courses  (i)  aimed  at  training  new  and\nexisting  staff  of  DAE  and  participating  NGOs  who  will  be  carrying  out  institutional  training\nprograms;  (ii)  intended  to  equip  field  staff  to  provide  village-based  training;  (iii)  aimed  at  DAE\nand NGO staff who will be providing follow-on extension support; and (iv) aimed at the majority\nof the intended beneficiaries, who will be small-scale farmers. Staff of the Food Crops Division\nwill be assisted in course formulation by a team of international and local consultants.\n\nii.\n\nThe Training Facilities\n\n86.\nThe  Project  will  use  existing  facilities  that  will  be  upgraded  to  accommodate  an\nincreased  number  of  farmer  trainees.  These  facilities  include  the  four  HTDCs  under  DAE  at\nChapai  Nawabganj,  Natore,  Pabna,  and  Rangpur;  two  agriculture  training  centers  under\nparticipating  NGOs  (BRAC  at  Dinajpur  and  GKF  at  Rangpur);  two  horticulture  training  centers\nunder  BADC  at  Rajshahi  and  Bogra  and  the  Rural  Development  Academy  that  provides\nagriculture training at Bogra. All of these training facilities will be used under the Project. Terms\nand conditions for the use of these facilities will be agreed upon and finalized between the DAE\nand the facility operator prior to loan disbursement. All training facilities will be supported under\nthe  Project  and  needs  for  any  upgrading,  equipment,  and  operational  requirements  will  be\nassessed  based  on  curriculum  design  and  number  of  institutional  trainees  intended  for  each\nfacility. Assistance will be provided through local consultants for designing the upgrading works\nrequired.\n\niii.\n\nThe Training Programs\n\nTraining  programs  will  be  designed  to  cover  all  farmers  interested  in  HVC  production\n87.\nand  will  be  oriented  to  less  risky  field  crops  like  tubers,  hybrid  maize,  sunflowers,  legumes,\nspices,  hardy  vegetables,  and  fruit  crops  such  as  banana  and  papaya.  Village-based  training\ncourses will also be designed for farmers not able or willing to participate in the institution-based\ntraining program. Courses designed for village-based training will resemble the institution-based\ncourses  for  the  small-scale  farmers  but  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  a  schedule\ndeveloped in consultation with the participating farmers.\n\niv.\n\nFollow-Up Activities\n\n88.\nFollow-up  field  training  for  participants  will  be  provided  during  crop  production  and\nmarketing. This will be organized by DAE in coordination with NGOs and will use the DAE field\nstaff (block supervisors), supplemented by NGO staff trained in horticulture. Wherever possible,\nparticipants  will  be  encouraged  to  form  marketing  groups  to  help  defray  marketing  costs  and\nnegotiate  bulk  purchasers.  Some  NGOs  already  have  vertically  integrated  programs,  which\ninclude the marketing of produce grown by participating farmers or grown on a contract basis.\nWhere possible, the PMU will try to locate focus areas of the Project where such programs are\nactive, especially in the early years of project implementation.\n\n\f22\n\nb. \n\nFarmer Mobilization and Credit Component\n\ni.\n\nIdentification and Mobilization of Farmers\n\nIdentifying  and  mobilizing  farmer  participants  for  the  Project  will  be  an  interactive\n89.\nprocess  entailing  coordination  between  the  staff  of  DAE  and  the  NGOs.  This  will  involve  the\nparticipating NGOs and DAE publicizing the Project; and the NGOs selecting participants based\non  agreed  selection  criteria  and  undertaking  group  formation.  NGOs  will  be  encouraged  to\nidentify  and  mobilize  households  headed  by  women,  and  progressive  women  farmers  to\nparticipate in the Project, wherever possible. The Project beneficiaries will be those who (i) own\nand operate landholdings of at least 0.2 ha and no more than 1.2 ha, (ii) have landholdings in\nsubdistricts identified as having good potential for HVCs, (iii) have access to primary markets,\n(iv)  indicate  a  willingness  to  participate  in  group  activities,  and  (v)  have  not  already  received\nsupport for HVC from some other source.\n\nii.\n\nCredit Provision for Crop Diversification\n\nAbout  160,000  of  the  planned  200,000  trainees35  will  opt  to  take  credit  packages  from\n90.\nparticipating  NGOs  after  completing  their  initial  training  program.  Selection  criteria  for  the\nprovision  of  credit  (in  addition  to  criteria  for  participation  in  the  training  program)  will  include\nsuccessful completion of the institutional training course or a minimum number of village-based\ntraining sessions, plus any other reasonable criteria a particular NGO may wish to impose. The\ncredit  packages  will  be  based  on  farmers\u2019  proposals  and  will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  the\ntype of crop to be grown and the area to be planted. A maximum loan size of Tk10,000 ($200)\nwill  be  allowed.  Terms  and  conditions  of  the  credit  packages  will  be  based  on  each  individual\nNGO's practices, which currently entail interest rates of 15-20 percent. In the interest of equity\namong participating beneficiaries, some broad standards will be maintained for the size of credit\npackages  provided,  interest  rates,  and  repayment  periods.  The  Government  has  agreed  to\ncoordinate with and among the NGOs to develop acceptable and standard terms and conditions\nfor  the  provision  of  subloans  to  beneficiaries.  The  allocation  of  funds  to  each  NGO  for  credit\nprovision  will  be  based  on  the  number  of  farmers  to  be  covered  and  will  be  decided  by\nagreement between DAE and each NGO, and incorporated in the contracts. Disbursements will\nbe made on the basis of agreed annual work plans.\n\niii.\n\nInteraction with Participating NGOs\n\n91.\nA  final  selection  of  NGOs  to  participate  in  the  Project  was  confirmed  during  loan\nnegotiations.  Furthermore,  as  a  condition  of  loan  disbursement,  contracts  will  be  signed\nbetween  the  PMU  and  the  selected  NGOs  specifying,  among  other  things,  the  subdistricts  in\nwhich  the  NGOs  will  operate,  the  roles  of  the  NGO  and  of  DAE  in  farmer  mobilization  and\ntraining, the operational and coordination arrangements between DAE and the NGO, the target\nnumber of farmers per subdistrict, agreed selection criteria for participating farmers, the size of\ncredit  packages  to  be  promoted,  general  parameters  relating  to  interest  rates  and  repayment\nperiods of the credit packages, and the fee to be provided to the NGO for its services.\n\niv.\n\nOn-Lending and Relending Conditions for Farmers' Credit\n\nThe  Government  will  make  the  agriculture  credit  funds  available  to  Bangladesh  Bank\n92.\nunder a financing agreement, with interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum and a repayment\n\n35  Assuming  a  drop  out  rate  of  20  percent  based  on  NGO  experience  and  discussions  with  extension  staff  and\n\n                  \n\nfarmers in the field.\n\n\f23\n\nperiod  of  20  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  The  Bangladesh  Bank,  in  turn,  will\nchannel the funds to the selected NGOs, through RAKUB (para. 76), on terms and conditions\nlaid  down  in  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  them,  satisfactory  to  the  Government  and\nADB.  Similar  agreements  will  be  signed  between  RAKUB  and  the  NGOs,  detailing  the  terms\nand  conditions  for  relending  and  repayments.  NGOs  will  be  provided  funds  at  the  prevailing\nPKSF  lending  rates  to  NGOs  with  a  repayment  period  of  up  to  two  years.36  Disbursements  to\nthe NGOs will be made semiannually and will be based on agreed annual work plans submitted\nby  the  PMU  to  Bangladesh  Bank.  The  NGOs  will  provide  funds  to  participating  farmers  at\nagreed terms and conditions satisfactory to the Government and the ADB.\n\n93.\nAny  decision  to  use  a  credit  channeling  agency  other  than  RAKUB  will  require  ADB\u2019s\nprior  approval,  and  the  proposed  agency  will  be  required  to  meet  qualification  criteria  agreed\nupon by the Government, Bangladesh Bank, and ADB.\n\nc.\n\nAdaptive Research component\n\nThe adaptive research will be undertaken under the supervision of the PMU.  The PMU\n94.\nwill  assess  and  finance  the  upgrading  requirements  of  the  horticulture  research  centers  in  the\nnorthwest  region;  finance  the  establishment  of  a  horticulture  data  bank  at  the  Bangladesh\nAgriculture Research Institute (BARI); and (based on proposals and requests from the extension\nworkers,  NGOs  and  DAE,  or  the  HTDCs),  contract  adaptive  research  projects  to  research\nagencies  in  the  region.  The  operation  of  the  contract  research  system  will  be  designed  in  the\nfirst  year  of  project  implementation  by  the  research  management  consultant  to  be  recruited  in\nthe PMU.\n\nd. \n\nMarketing Support component\n\ni.\n\nMarket Information\n\n95.\nThe  market  information  subcomponent  will  entail  formulating  a  market  information  and\ndissemination  strategy,  training  DAM  staff  in  market  information  collection  and  dissemination,\npreparing broadcast modules for the dissemination of market information by radio, and training\nDAM  staff  to  do  market  surveys.  Consulting  services,  staff  training,  vehicles,  and  equipment\nsupport  will  be  provided  to  assist  DAM  with  the  market  information  and  dissemination.  The\npreparation  of  broadcast  modules  will  be  contracted  out  to  an  appropriately  qualified  media\ncompany.\n\nii.\n\nMarket Infrastructure\n\n96.\nThe preliminary identification of primary and growers' markets for upgrading will be done\nby DAM based on market surveys and studies, some of which are already completed and some\nof which will be undertaken under the Project. Candidate markets for upgrading will be proposed\nto  the  market  infrastructure  committees,  and  recommendations  of  the  committees  will  be\ndiscussed  with  the  relevant  local  administration  (districts  in  the  case  of  growers'  markets  and\nsubdistricts in the case of primary markets) prior to final funding approval by the PMU.  Market\nconstruction/upgrading will then be arranged directly between the PMU and LGED.  The LGED\nPIU will be responsible for implementation.\n\n97. With  regard  to  market  O&M,  the  PMU  will  direct  a  regionwide  market  management\nthe  study\u2019s\nstudy,  using \n\ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.  On \n\nthe  basis  of \n\n36 The current PKSF rate for large NGOs is 7.0 percent.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\nrecommendations  and  consultation  with  local  authorities  and  representative  private  sector\nstakeholders, management options will be developed, implemented, and monitored. The options\nwill be adjusted, as appropriate throughout the project implementation period.  In developing the\noptions,  particular  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  governance  and  on  developing  viable  and\nsustainable public-private partnerships in market management.\n\ne.\n\nPilot Agribusiness Credit component\n\nThe pilot agribusiness component will be undertaken by RAKUB. Potential borrowers will\n98.\nbe  identified  through  advertisements  in  newspapers  in  Dhaka  and  the  northwest  region.  The\nadvertisements will explain the nature of the component, the types of enterprises to be provided\ncredit,  the  counterpart  financing  requirements,  and  the  need  for  preinvestment  technical  and\nfinancial feasibility studies.\n\n99.\nFunds  for  the  credit  line  will  be  made  available  from  the  Government  to  Bangladesh\nBank, at interest rate of 3 percent and repayment period of 20 years including a grace period of\n5  years.  Bangladesh  Bank  will  on-lend  the  funds  to  RAKUB  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  rate.37\nRAKUB in turn will relend the funds to interested agribusiness entrepreneurs at their standard\ncommercial terms and conditions. The entrepreneurs will be registered within the existing legal\nframework  for  the  establishment  and  operation  of  agribusiness  enterprises  (packaging,  cold\nfeed  mills,  seed  processing,  specialized  refrigerated\nstorages \ntransportation, etc.), and will provide at least 25 percent of the equity from their own resources.\nThe  maximum  loan  size  will  be  $150,000.  Any  loan  above  $100,000  will  require  the  prior\napproval of ADB. Interest rates will be the market rates prevailing for similar commercial RAKUB\nloans and repayment periods will be agreed between RAKUB and the entrepreneur, based on\nprojected  cash  flows  of  enterprise  to  be  financed.  To  secure  a  loan,  the  Borrower  will  be\nrequired  to  provide  collateral  acceptable  to  the  lending  institution.  ADB  will  review  the\ncomponent fully after 50 percent of funds under the credit line have been disbursed.\n\nfor  potato,  vegetables, \n\n5.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\n100.\nThe  Project  is  innovative  in  implementing  the  DAE-NGO  partnership  for  extension  and\ntraining  and  bringing  the  NGOs  into  agricultural  credit  for  small-scale  farmers.  Some\ncomponents  may  therefore  take  time  to  be  set  up  and  become  fully  operational.  Training\nprograms and training materials will need to be formulated; DAE staff and NGO staff will need to\nbe  trained;  and,  before  the  program  can  begin,  the  training  facilities  will  need  to  be  upgraded\nand  the  program  publicized  in  the  project  area  so  that  farmers  can  express  interest  and\ncommitment. Market surveys will be needed before the marketing infrastructure component can\nbegin.  A  seven-year  implementation  period  has  therefore  been  planned,  with  the  first  year\nconsidered a start-up phase and the remaining six years as the implementation phase. Some of\nthe  market  information  work,  the  adaptive  research  work,  the  market  infrastructure  work,  and\nthe  pilot  agribusiness  credit  provision  could,  however,  commence  within  the  first  year.  An\nimplementation schedule is given in Appendix 7.\n\n6.\n\nProcurement\n\n101. Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement. The major items to be procured will be equipment and materials, as\nwell as a relatively modest amount of civil works. Equipment will consist of office, training, and\nresearch  equipment  for  the  PIUs,  HTDCs,  village-based  training  program,  and  horticulture\n\n37 Bangladesh Bank rate is the rate at which the Central Bank lends funds to commercial banks.\n\n                  \n\n\f25\n\nresearch  centers.  A  modest  number  of  vehicles  will  also  be  procured  to  allow  mobility  of  field\nand headquarters staff and consultants. Materials to be procured will largely consist of training\nmaterials for the training programs, including approximately 200,000 copies of training and field\nmanuals  for  farmer  participants.  Civil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  consist  of  the\nupgrading of HTDCs, and the construction/upgrading of primary and growers' markets.\n\n102. All  procurement  will  generally  be  undertaken  by  the  PMU  after  agreement  with  the\nrelevant  PIU  on  the  scope,  nature,  and  specifications  of  the  items  to  be  procured.  Items\nprocured  by  the  subborrowers  under  the  pilot  agricultural  credit  line  will  be  procured  through\ndirect  purchase  in  accordance  with  established  commercial  practices.  Since  all  civil  works\nprocured under the Project will be simple in nature, dispersed throughout the northwest region\nand  relatively  small  in  size,38  an  international  firm  is  not  likely  to  be  interested  in  bidding  for\nthem. Moreover, works of this nature can be successfully completed to acceptable standards by\nlocal contractors. Civil works will thus be awarded through local competitive bidding procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n103. Vehicles  and  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  for  packages\ncosting  more  than  $100,000  and  less  than  $500,000,  and  by  direct  purchase  for  packages\ncosting  less  than  $100,000.  Service  contracts  and  contracts  for  training  materials  will  be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified local firms, institutes, and\nagencies  using  ADB  guidelines.  Service  contracts  for  NGOs  will  be  by  direct  purchase,\nnegotiated on the basis of preselection of NGOs according to selection criteria agreed between\nthe  Government  and  ADB  (see  Appendix  8)  and  with  payments  of  standard  fees  per\nparticipating farmer. Appendix 9 gives an indicative list of procurement packages showing size\nand method of procurement.\n\n7.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe  project  will  require  582  person-months  of  consulting  services  consisting  of  124\n104.\nperson-months  of  international  and  458  person-months  of  local  expert  services.  Most  of  this\nexpertise  will  be  for  the  formulation  of  the  training  programs  and  for  assistance  with  project\nstart-up and management.  Some local and international expertise will also be provided to DAM\nfor designing a program of data collection and dissemination and to provide associated training.\nConsulting  services  will  also  be  provided  to  assist  local  authorities  in  formulating  and  testing\nimproved management systems for primary and grower markets. Service contracts will include\ncontracts  between  the  PMU  and  participating  NGOs,  contracts  with  a  media  company  to\nprepare  broadcast  modules  for  the  DAM,  a  contract  to  prepare  the  horticulture  research  data\nbank, contracts with horticulture research centers to undertake adaptive research, and contracts\nfor  periodic  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Indicative  terms  of  reference  for\nconsulting services are presented in Appendix 10.\n\n105. All consulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.  Since  specialized  expertise  and  experience  will  be  required  for  the  formulation  of\ntraining courses and implementation of training programs, consultants for this component will be\nrecruited as a team from a reputed agriculture training institution, possibly in combination with a\nsuitably qualified consulting firm. All other consultants will be recruited as teams from qualified\nconsulting firms in accordance with the packages shown in Appendix 10, except for the adaptive\nresearch and seed verification specialists who, because of the nature of expertise required, will\nbe recruited as individual consultants.\n\n                  \n38 The largest single contract is unlikely to exceed $350,000.\n\n\f26\n\nThe Government will advance action in respect of consultant recruitment procedures to\n\n106.\nthe stage of shortlisting, to expedite the Project once the proposed loan is approved.\n\n8.\n\nTraining\n\n107.\nTraining  activities  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  Project  with  one  whole  component\ndevoted  to  the  training  of  DAE  and  NGO  field  and  extension  workers  as  well  as  farmer\nparticipants.  Under  this  component,  about  600  professional  staff  of  DAE  and  the  NGOs  will\nreceive  training  in  the  production  and  marketing  of  HVCs  and  in  extension  and  farmer\nmobilization  techniques.  About  200,000  small-scale  farmers  will  receive  training  at  centers\nupgraded by the Project or village-based training through their NGO groups, supplemented by\ninput from DAE staff. In addition, in the Project provides for the training of DAM staff. This will\ninclude  on-the-job  training  by  local  and  international  consultants  and  study  tours  to  observe\nmarket management and information dissemination systems in relevant neighboring countries.\n\n9.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n108. As  the  Project  is  largely  credit  based  and  will,  to  a  considerable  extent,  use  existing\nfacilities  and  services  (HTDCs;  the  staff  of  DAE,  DAM,  and  LGED;  the  staff  of  participating\nNGOs; and the services of Bangladesh Bank and RAKUB) large incremental O&M costs are not\nenvisaged. The major operational expenditures will be the costs of the training program (about\n$400,00  per  year  over  the  project  period),  the  O&M  costs  of  the  upgraded  HTDCs  (about\n$100,000 per year) and the O&M costs of the markets (about $10,000 per market per year for\nprimary markets and $20,000 per market per year for growers' markets).\n\n109.\nThe Project will cover training program O&M costs during the project period, but will firm\nup  modalities  and  arrangements  to  make  the  training  program  and  the  HTDCs  self-financing.\nThe  Government  has  agreed  that  various  modalities  will  be  investigated  during  the  project\nperiod,  including  possible  rental  of  the  facilities  to  NGOs/private  sector  entities,  and  will  be\nagreed upon during the mid term review.\n\nThe O&M of market facilities in Bangladesh and in the northwest region in particular is\n110.\nalready  undertaken  following  established  procedures  that  entail  leasing  the  facilities  by  local\nauthorities to private sector management contractors on an annual basis. This allows some of\nthe fees collected to be returned through O&M financing. However, considerable amounts of the\nfees  are  lost.  This  situation  will  be  addressed  under  the  Project  through  a  study  on  market\nmanagement  which  will  present  alternative  O&M  formulations  to  local  authorities.  During  the\nproject  period,  local  authorities  participating  in  the  market  infrastructure  component  will  be\nencouraged,  under the guidance  of  staff of DAM, LGED, and the PMU, to implement different\nO&M  formulations  until  optimal  solutions  are  found.  In  doing  so,  particular  emphasis  will  be\nplaced on developing public-private sector partnerships in market management. The options will\nthen provide demonstration cases to other local authorities, giving an incentive to improve and\nupgrade  market  management  throughout  the  region.  The  Government  has  indicated  that  a\ncommitment  to  improve  market  O&M  procedures  will  be  a  part  of  the  market  upgrading\nagreement signed with local authorities prior to market improvement.\n\n\f27\n\n10. \n\nSustainability\n\n111.\nLarge incremental O&M costs are not envisaged (para. 108). Upon project completion,\nthe  only  facilities  that  will  require  continued  financial  support  by  the  Government  will  be  the\ntraining centers. The Government has agreed to investigate modalities to make the centers self-\nfinancing  (para.  56).  Even  if  no  means  of  financing  the  centers  are  formulated,  the  cost  of\nrunning them is expected to be modest (about $100,000 per annum).\n\nThe main operational costs after the project period will be the costs of agricultural inputs\n112.\nthe  farmers  use  for  continued  diversified  crop  production  and  the  operating  costs  for  markets\nupgraded  under  the  Project.  On  Project  completion,  the  participating  NGOs  should  be  able  to\ncontinue their agriculture credit and training activities with funds generated from other sources,\nincluding the interest spread on their microfinance activities and borrowings from the proposed\nKrishi Rin Foundation. In the case of markets, while the cost of market construction will be met\nby the Government during the project period, the cost of market maintenance will be borne by\nthe  private  sector  users  of  the  market  facilities,  through  fees  to  market  lessees  who  are\ncontracted by the market committee to operate them.\n\n11. \n\nBeneficiary Participation\n\n113.\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  be  demand-driven  and  participatory,  especially  the  training\nand  extension  and  the  farmer  mobilization  and  credit  components.  The  program  and\nqualification criteria for these components will be publicized within the target subdistricts by the\nDAE and the NGOs, and farmers who meet the selection criteria will be encouraged to enlist in\nthe Project. Once enrolled in the program, participating farmers will decide which of the training\ncourses to attend, which crops they will grow, how much land will be planted to HVCs, and the\nsize of the credit package they will receive from the NGOs (depending on the crop and area to\nbe planted).  Given the important role played by women in crop production in the project area,\nthe NGOs will ensure that farmers\u2019 groups include both men and women, in mixed or separate\ngroups,  as  appropriate.    Project  monitoring  activities  will  be  designed  to  include  feedback  so\nthat the experience and views of farmers who have participated can be reviewed by the PMU,\nallowing appropriate changes in design, the training program, or the credit provision to be made\nduring  the  midterm  review.  The  pilot  agribusiness  component  has  also  been  designed  so  that\nparticipants enroll themselves, and similar feedback mechanisms will be built into the monitoring\nprocedures.  For  market  upgrading,  beneficiary  participation  will  consist  of  interaction  between\nthe local government authority planning the market, market users and the LGED, which will be\npreparing individual market designs. Subdistrict and district market committees will be the forum\nfor this interaction for the primary and growers\u2019 markets, respectively.\n\n12.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nTo  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  and  to  expedite\n114.\nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,\nestablish  three  imprest  accounts  in  Bangladesh  Bank,  one  for  the  PMU  to  cover  funding\nrequirements for the public sector agencies with an initial amount of not more than $1,000,000\nequivalent, one for Bangladesh Bank to provide for the flow of credit funds to the participating\nNGOs  with  an  initial  amount  of  not  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  and  one  for  Bangladesh\nBank  to  finance  the  pilot  agribusiness  credit  line  with  an  initial  amount  of  not  more  than\n$100,000. Payments may be made from and to the accounts for all eligible expenditures under\nthe Project. The first account will be operated and managed by the PMU and the second two by\nthe  Bangladesh  Bank,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidating  advance  payments  from  the\nimprest accounts, not exceeding $50,000 equivalent.\n\n\f28\n\n13. \n\nRevolving Funds\n\n115.\nTwo revolving funds will be set up within the first year of project implementation to allow\nfor continued use of funds provided under the crop production credit and the agribusiness credit\nline.  The  revolving  funds  will  be  established  in  the  Bangladesh  Bank  rather  than  RAKUB  to\nallow  flexibility  to  change  the  credit  channeling  agency,  if  necessary,  during  the  project\nimplementation.  The  revolving  funds  will  be  operated  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank  throughout  the\nproject life and for a further 10 years after project completion. The Bangladesh Bank will assign\nand retain one senior officer to manage the two funds.\n\n14.\n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n116. Each  PIU  will  establish  and  maintain  accounts  and  records  of  project  progress  and\nexpenditures  to  facilitate  the  identification  of  income  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.\nThe PIU staff will each be assisted in this by staff from the PMU, which will have an adequate\nnumber  of  accounting  staff,  including  two  accountants  dedicated  solely  to  monitoring  project\nexpenses,  reimbursement,  and  accounts.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  consolidating  all\naccounts  and  submitting  all  reimbursement  requests  to  ADB.  Audited  accounts  and  financial\nstatements, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of\nthe close of the related financial year.\n\n117. Each  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports,  which  the  PMU  will  consolidate  into\nproject reports. The reports will detail the achievements related to the implementation schedule,\ntargets  and  plans  for  the  next  reporting  period,  problems  requiring  resolution,  and  the  steps\nbeing taken to resolve them.\n\n118. Within three months of project closing, DAE will prepare a project completion report for\nsubmission to ADB. The report will detail the results and achievements of the Project, provide\nan  analysis  of  the  funds  spent,  and  indicate  measures  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  project\ninvestments.\n\n15.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n119. Project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  will  take  place  at  two  levels.  The  first\nlevel will be that of the individual farmer participant and will be based on reports provided by the\nparticipating NGOs on the progress and success in HVC production by their participating farmer\nbeneficiaries. This will be measured by factors such as the level of repayment and the number\nof  repeat  loans,  as  well  as  through  participant  farmer  surveys,  using  the  high  ratio  of  staff  to\nbeneficiary\u2019s characteristic of NGO operations. At a broader, more general level, BME surveys\nwill be undertaken annually during the second phase of the Project by an institution or agency\ncontracted  by  the  PMU.  The  factors  to  be  monitored  will  include  the  number  of  beneficiaries\nattending  the  institutional  and  village-based  training  programs,  the  overall  number  of  people\nreceiving credit, overall repayment rates for all NGOs, changes in income levels for participants,\nand  cropping  patterns  in  participating  subdistricts.  A  baseline  survey  covering  this  information\nwill be undertaken at the beginning of the Project to provide a benchmark. Major indicators will\nbe developed based on the benchmark survey by the BME consultant for monitoring during the\nproject period.\n\n\f29\n\n16.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n120. A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  undertaken  at  the  end  of  the  third  year  of\nimplementation.  The  purpose  of  the  review  will  be  to  critically  evaluate  the  progress  of  the\nProject,  the  validity  of  the  implementation  procedures,  the  efficiency  of  the  flow  of  funds  to\nNGOs  and  their  ability  to  use  them  effectively,  the  performance  of  the  training  programs,  and\nthe performance of the pilot agribusiness credit line. Also during the midterm review, a decision\nwill be taken regarding whether to involve other financing agencies, such as the proposed Krishi\nRin Foundation. Following the review, corrective measures will be introduced as appropriate to\nremedy weaknesses.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n121. An initial environmental examination was undertaken for the proposed Project to identify\nenvironmental issues and required mitigating measures. Overall, the Project is unlikely to have\nany  major  negative  environmental  impacts.  However,  attention  will  need  to  be  paid  to  the\neffective and safe use of fertilizers, pesticides and groundwater. The commercial production of\nHVCs  tends  to  be  input  intensive  and  could  lead  to  higher  levels  of  pesticide,  fertilizer,  and\ngroundwater  use  than  would  occur  with  some  traditional  crops  (although  water  use  would  be\nless  than  with  rice).  While  the  overall  area  to  be  brought  into  the  production  of  HVCs  is  quite\nsmall (50,000 ha out of some cultivated area of 4.0 million ha) localized concentrations of HVC\nproduction  may  cause  some  concern.  To  mitigate  against  any  problems  arising,  the  training\nprograms  for  participating  farmers  will  place  a  strong  emphasis  on  appropriate  and  safe\npesticide  and  fertilizer  use  (including  integrated  pest  management  measures)39  and  on  the\nefficient  use  of  irrigation  water.  The  Project  will  construct  training  centers,  minor  markets,  and\ngrowers\u2019  markets.  This  will,  however,  be  a  small  portion  of  the  total  activities  and  the  overall\nimpact is likely to be limited. Markets may have a few longer-term impacts during operation due\nto  waste  water  and  waste  production  disposal.  These  issues  will  be  addressed  through\nimproved  market  operation  and  management  systems,  which  will  be  developed  and\nimplemented during the Project. The Project also provides for a domestic consultant to monitor\nthe environmental impact of project activities throughout the implementation period.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Measures\n\n122. Eighty-six percent of the population of the northwest region (27.3 million people) is rural\nand  thus  dependent  on  agriculture  for  a  livelihood.  The  1996  agricultural  census  reported  3.2\nmillion  farm  households  in  the  northwest  region,  and  1.9  million  landless  rural  households.\nLandholding households include 2.5 million small and marginal farmers (.02-1.0 ha), 0.6 million\nmedium  (1.0-3.0  ha)  and  0.1  million  large  farmers  (over  3.0  ha).  With  increasing  population,\nfarm  sizes  have  decreased  and  landlessness  has  increased.  With  few  sources  of  income\noutside  of  agriculture,  farm  size  and  productivity  is  directly  linked  to  levels  of  poverty  and\nprosperity.  Thus, while the landless and marginal landholding families are, almost by definition\npoor, many small-scale farmers waver on the boundary between poor and non-poor; a marginal\ndrop in their income levels could place them into a poverty trap. Lack of employment is also a\nsevere problem. Agriculture does not generate enough full-time employment opportunities and\noff-farm employment opportunities are limited.  Poverty is, therefore, pervasive. The incidence\n\n39 Taking into account ADB\u2019s Handbook for Incorporation of Integrated Pest Management in Agriculture Projects.\n\n                  \n\n\f30\n\nof poverty measured by the head-count index of poverty40 indicated that 62.2 percent of the total\npopulation of Rajshahi Division was poor during 1995-1996, which was substantially higher than\nthe national figure of 53.1 percent.\n\n123. One of the main outcomes of the Project is expected to be a decrease in the levels of\npoverty in the project area through increased incomes of small-scale farmers and an increase in\nbusiness  and  employment  opportunities.  Although  the  project  benefits  will  be  distributed\nprimarily  to  small-scale  farmers,  landless  laborers  and  marginal  farmers  will  benefit  through\nincreased employment opportunities in planting, harvesting, and transport, as well as indirectly\nthrough employment generated by agroprocessing and marketing.\n\n124. Women's participation in income generating activities in the Project area is constrained\nby  cultural  and  religious  traditions,  burdensome  household  duties,  early  marriage,  and  child-\nrearing. These also prevent women from continuing their education and their exposure to skill\nenhancement  and  economic  opportunities  remains  limited.  Nonetheless,  women  play  an\nimportant  role  in  agricultural  activities,  especially  in  small  landholding  families.  Furthermore,\nabout 11-15 percent of the households in the project area is headed by women.41 The project\ndesign  has  thus  taken  into  account  the  opportunities  the  project  will  open  for  women  in  the\nproject area.\n\n125. Notably, the NGOs that will participate in the Project already have a strong bias toward\nwomen in their programs: more than 50 percent of their lending activities have historically been\nfor women.  This has led to a change in the perception of women in the project area, and the\nNGOs  often  employ  women  extension  workers  and  field  trainers.  Beneficiary  and  training\ngroups  comprising  both  men  and  women  are  common  and  accepted.  During  project\nimplementation, efforts will be made to ensure full access to the training, extension, and credit\nprograms for women.  To assist in this, a gender specialist consultant has been included in the\nPMU.  A summary gender strategy is placed in Appendix 11.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n126.\nFinancial and economic analyses have been undertaken for increased HVC production\nfrom  farmers  who  are  expected  to  participate  in  NGO  programs  for  crop  diversification  and\nintensification,  the  main  quantifiable  benefit  arising  from  the  Project.  Other  economic  benefits\naccruing  from  the  Project  but  not  quantified  include  loss  reductions  and  reduced  marketing\ncosts  through  improvements  to  the  growers\u2019  markets,  reduced  costs  of  marketing  and  higher\nproduce  values  at  village  markets,  increased  value  added  due  to  the  pilot  agribusiness  credit\nline, and increased production from farmers who do not participate in NGO programs but adopt\nHVC  production.  Detailed  economic  and  financial  analyses  have  been  carried  out  and  the\nresults are summarized in Appendix 12.\n\n127. Over  the  seven-year  project  life,  about  160,000  farmers  are  expected  to  form  HVC\nproduction  and  marketing  groups,  undergo  field  and  institutional  training,  and  take  credit\npackages  from  participating  NGOs.  On  this  basis,  at  maturity,  the  project  will  provide  a  total\nincremental value added to the sector of $27.9 million per annum.\n\n                  \n\n40 The  head  count  index  (HCI)  measures  the  percentage  of  the  population  living  in  households  with  per  capita\n\nconsumption that is less than the poverty line, based on calorie intake data.\n\n41 Estimated by the Department of Women\u2019s Affairs.\n\n\f31\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n128.\nIllustrative  crop  budgets  have  been  formulated  to  assess  the  profitability  of  individual\ncrops.  Project  cost  and  benefit  estimates  are  based  on  reasonable  assumptions  and  are  well\nbelow  potential  under  ideal  conditions  using  recommended  technical  packages.  Farm  model\nfinancial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  for  six  potential  farm  models,  representing  two  farm\nsizes (1.0 ha, and 0.5 ha) and three diversification options. Return on investment is projected at\nan average of 39 percent for 1 ha farms and 48 percent for 0.5 ha farms. Average annual net\nfarm incomes are expected to increase to about $284 for the 0.5 ha farms, and $525 for the 1.0\nha farms compared to their current income levels of $217 and $434, respectively. The average\nannual labor requirement is expected to increase by 18 days for the 0.5 ha farms and 37 days\nfor the 1.0 ha farms, while returns per labor-day are expected to increase by 19 and 10 percent\nrespectively.  The  incremental  returns  per  incremental  labor-day  are  well  in  excess  of  the\nprevailing daily wage rate for unskilled agricultural labor in all farm models. The increased labor\ndemand is well within the capacity of typical small farm households. For larger farms, seasonal\nfarm labor is also available for hire in the project area.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n129.\nThe Project\u2019s economic viability was estimated on the assumption of a project life of 20\nyears,  an  investment  period  of  6  years,  and  an  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12  percent.\nFinancial prices of nontraded commodities have been converted to economic prices by using a\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.89.  As  there  is  a  surplus  of  labor  in  the  project  area,  shadow\npricing of wage rates has been applied at 80 percent of the basic daily wage rate in the analysis.\n\n130.\nIncremental  economic  benefits  for  each  farm  model  were  assessed  using  the\nappropriate economic prices for inputs and outputs, and the results were aggregated based on\nexpectations  of  the  frequency  that  each  type  of  diversification  strategy  would  be  adopted  and\nthe size distribution derived from the 1996 agricultural census. Economic costs of Project inputs,\nexcluding  credit,  were  estimated  by  deducting  taxes,  duties,  and  price  contingencies,  and\nconverting local prices to economic values using the standard conversion factor.\n\n131. On  these  assumptions,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  HVC  production  was\nestimated at 30.7 percent. Standard sensitivity analyses indicate that the Project is sufficiently\nrobust.\n\nTable 3: Economic Analyses and Sensitivity Analyses\n\nDetails\n\nEIRR (%)\n\nBase Case\n10% Cost Overrun\n10% Decline in Benefits\n\nCombination of Benefit\n   Decline and Cost Overrun\n1 year Delay in Benefits\n\n30.7\n20.3\n16.8\n\n4.0\n\n26.5\n\nSwitching\nValues (%)\n\n17.3\n13.2\n\n \n\n     Source: Mission estimates.\n\n\fB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n32\n\n132.\nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  major  negative  environmental  impacts.  While\nincreased  production  of  HVCs  has  an  inherent  danger  of  increased  and  inappropriate  use  of\npesticides  and  fertilizers,  the  crop  production  packages  to  be  promoted  under  the  Project  will\nemphasize  appropriate  inputs  and  the  use  of  integrated  pest  management  in  line  with\nGovernment policy. Diversification away from rice and into HVCs will result in more efficient use\nof  irrigation  water,  which  will  be  environmentally  positive.  Where  possible,  the  Project  will\npromote  further  efficiencies  in  water  use  and  the  adoption  of  improved  technologies.  Careful\nattention will need to be given to ensuring appropriate rotations as repeated production of a crop\non the same piece of land is likely to have negative impacts on soil quality and pest and disease\noccurrence.  The  proposed  extent  of  HVCs  in  the  farm  plans  should  allow  adequate\nopportunities  for  rotations.  Many  HVCs  also  produce  a  significant  amount  of  residues  and\nunmarketable  produce,  which  should  be  recycled.  However,  care  will  need  to  be  taken  to\nminimize the promotion of plant diseases from crop wastes.\n\nInvestments  in  primary  and  grower  markets  will  result  in  the  concentration  of  large\n133.\namounts of perishable plant material in a small area. Without proper waste disposal, this may\nresult  in  an  environmental  hazard.  Proper  management  of  the  waste  will  be  a  concern  of  the\nsupport given to market management.\n\n134. While  the  activities  to  be  refinanced  under  the  agribusiness  pilot  credit  line  are  not  yet\nidentified,  their  impact  is  likely  to  be  localized  due  to  the  small  size  of  the  ventures  to  be\nfinanced. Impacts of concern will be waste disposal, dust, and noise. These will be monitored to\nensure that acceptable standards are maintained.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Impact\n\n135. Under  the  training  and  credit  support  program,  the  Project  will  reach  approximately\n160,000  farm  households  whose  landholdings  are  about  0.2-1.2  ha  each.  Given  the  strong\ncorrelation  of  poverty  with  land  ownership42  in  the  project  area,  about  50  percent  of  the  small\nfarm  households  are  poor.  About  75,000  poor  farm  households  are  thus  estimated  to  benefit\ndirectly from the Project.\n\n136. While small-scale farmers will directly benefit from technical assistance to diversify into\ncash  crop  production  and  enhanced  credit  access  provided  by  the  Project,  some  indirect\nbenefits  through  employment  generation  are  also  expected.  Improved  crop  production  will\nrequire  an  additional  4.4  million  labor  days  per  annum.  Additional  labor  of  family  members  is\nlikely  to  suffice  for  a  large  portion  of  the  labor  requirement.  However,  the  employment\ngeneration impact will be positive and crucial, especially on the 1.9 million landless households\nin the region who heavily depend on income from paid agricultural labor, as small landholders\ncommonly  hire  agricultural  seasonal  labor,  especially  during  harvest  season.  In  addition,\nnoncrop  income  generating  activities  are  expected  to  emerge  as  a  linkage  effect  of  HVC\nproduction.  Such  income  generating  activities  have  already  been  practiced  in  a  small  scale  in\nthe project area, and the generation of additional business opportunities is likely to benefit the\nentire rural population.\n\n                  \n\n42  According  to  the World Bank (1998) Bangladesh From Counting the Poor to Making the Poor Count,  the  poor\npopulation account for 43-70 percent among small-scale farmers, 32 percent among medium-scale farmers, and 9\npercent among large-scale farmers in rural area.\n\n\f33\n\n137. No large adverse impact of the Project is expected and several positive indirect impacts\nare  likely  to  benefit  the  entire  rural  population.  While  small-scale  farmers  directly  benefit  from\nthe  Project,  landless  and  marginal  landholders  will  benefit  from  increased  agricultural\nemployment  and  business  in  the  project  area.  Women  and  ethnic  minority  groups  will  directly\nand indirectly benefit from the Project.\n\n138. With  technical,  physical,  financial,  and  marketing  support  of  the  Project,  the  current\nenvironment provides ample opportunities for small-scale farmers in the project area to benefit\nconsiderably from producing HVCs, and many of them will gradually diversify their crops during\nthe  project  period.  As  the  early  participants  achieve  improved  incomes,  even  relatively  risk\nadverse  farmers  can  be  expected  to  gradually  diversify  their  crops.  Given  the  prevalent\nunemployment  and  underemployment  situation,  the  need  for  income-generating  sources  is\nacute and the demand for crop diversification is strong in the project area. The opening of the\nJamuna bridge has improved the distribution and domestic trading of agricultural produce of the\nproject area, and provided a new opportunity for export marketing.43 Some cold storage facilities\nhave been established, and the distribution network of vegetable and fruits through middlemen\nhas  expanded.  Although  the  expanded  trading  has  tended  to  benefit  the  traders  more  than\nfarmers, farmers in the project area now recognize that they have more options for marketing of\ntheir produce.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n139.\n  To  minimize  the  risks  involved  in  implementation,  the  project  design  has  been  built\nfirmly on the ongoing reforms and the new extension policy of the Government. This involves, in\nparticular,  decentralized  extension,  increased  involvement  of  the  NGO  and  private  sector  in\nagriculture  support  services,  improvements  to  marketing,  and  promotion  of  agribusiness\ninvolvement in output processing in order to increase value added. Nevertheless several risks\ncould affect the overall success of the Project.\n\n140.\nFirst,  failure  of  the  participating  farmers  to  successfully  use  credit  could  lead  to  a\nreduction in the projected incremental income of subborrowers, which, in turn, would reduce the\nProject\u2019s  benefits  to  individual  farmers  as  well  as  its  overall  benefits.  The  project  design  is\ntherefore  based  on  the  provision  of  credit  only  to  farmers  who  have  undergone  adequate\ntraining in HVC production. In addition, the project design provides for follow up support for the\nparticipating farmers covering crop production and marketing by DAE and the NGOs.\n\n141. Second,  it  is  important  that  training  courses  are  formulated  in  the  early  part  of  the\nProject,  and  DAE  and  NGO  staff  undergo  training  in  the  promotion  and  technical  aspects  of\nHVC  production.  Any  delay  in  completing  these  activities  may  impede  the  full-scale  start  of\nproject  activities,  and,  given  the  seasonal  nature  of  much  HVC  production,  could  result  in  a\nyear\u2019s  loss  of  activities.  To  avoid  delays  in  this  important  start-up  activity,  international  and\ndomestic consulting services are provided to help the PMU design and implement the training\nprogram.\n\nThird,  the  Project  will  entail  an  innovative  partnership  between  DAE  and  participating\n142.\nNGOs.    Initiating  this  partnership  and  operating  it  will  have  risks.  The  first  steps  in  DAE-NGO\ncooperation  for  the  Project  have  already  been  through  a  joint  workshop  organized  during  the\nappraisal  mission.  Based  on  discussions  with  all  participating  NGOs  and  the  staff  of  DAE,  a\ncoordination  committee  has  been  included  in  the  project  design  to  meet  regularly  and  resolve\npractical implementation problems. To further minimize the risks and ensure clear delineation of\n\n43 For instance, BRAC has assisted qualified farmers in the project area under its Vegetable Export Program.\n\n                  \n\n\f34\n\nresponsibilities,  the  formulation  of  draft  contracts  between  the  DAE  and  the  NGOs  was  a\ncondition  of  loan  negotiations  and  the  signing  of  such  contracts  is  a  condition  of  loan\ndisbursement.\n\nFourth, is the risk of poor coordination between agencies at the field level. The project\n143.\ndesign takes this risk into account and has provided for (i) two coordination committees, one for\nDAE-NGOs and the other for market infrastructure; and (ii) two project supervision units in the\nproject area.\n\nA.\n\nProject Specific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nIn addition to the standard covenants and assurances the Government has agreed to the\n\n144.\nfollowing:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n\n(vi)\n\nThe Government will establish the PMU at Dhaka, headed by a full-time, senior,\nexperienced  project  director;  appoint  a  sufficient  number  of  staff  with  adequate\nseniority  and  experience  for  the  PMU\u2019s  operation;  and  provide  the  support\nnecessary for full supervision and management of the Project.\n\nThe  Government  will  establish  PIUs  in  each  implementing  agency  and  two\nproject  coordination  and  supervision  units  in  DAE  facilities  in  the  northwest\nregion,  and  provide  them  with  requisite  staff  and  operational  and  logistical\nsupport.\n\nFrom  the  third  year  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  devise  alternative\nsustainable  financing  arrangements  to  make  the  HTDCs  at  least  partially  self-\nfinancing.\n\nStarting  with  markets  upgraded  by  the  Project,  the  Government  with  the  local\nauthorities,  will \nfinancing\nprocedures to ensure proper market maintenance.\n\nimproved  market  management  and \n\nimplement \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  full  financing  is  available  in  DAM\u2019s  annual\nbudget  for  continued  operation  of  the  communication  equipment  and  daily\nbroadcasts.\n\nAgreements  will  be  reached  between  DAE  and  operator  of  identified  training\ncenters on the use of their facilities for training staff and beneficiaries under the\nProject.\n\n(vii) \n\nTerms  of  reference  for  the  DAE-NGO  coordination  committee  and  the  market\ncoordination  committees  will  be  formulated  by  the  PMU,  in  coordination  with\nconcerned NGOs within the first six months of loan effectiveness.\n\n(viii)  Two  separate  revolving  funds  will  be  set  up,  within  Bangladesh  Bank,  for\nrecovered  loan  funds  from  the  crop  production  credit,  and  for  the  pilot\nagribusiness credit line, to allow these funds to be recycled for continued use.\n\n(ix) \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  existing\nBADC retail seed outlets and of the fertilizer distribution system, and will provide\nto  ADB  by  June  2001  the  outcome  and  timetable  for  further  action.  The\nGovernment will also reassess and reformulate the procedures for seed imports,\ntesting, and approval by December 2001.\n\n\f35\n\n(x) \n\nThe  Government  will  not  make  any  plan  or  implement  debt  amnesty  or  other\nforgiveness of loan repayment obligations under crop production or agribusiness\ncredit.\n\n(xi) \n\nThe Government will ensure the compliance of the Project gender strategy.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n145.\n\nTwo conditions the Government has agreed to meet prior to loan effectiveness are\n\nPMU will have been set up and staffed satisfactorily to ADB, including the project\ndirector and heads of all units in the PMU; and\n\nfinancing agreements for crop production and agribusiness credit will have been\nsigned between the Ministry of Finance and the Bangladesh Bank, setting out the\nterms and conditions for relending from the Government to Bangladesh Bank.\n\nC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement\n\nThree conditions the Government has agreed to meet prior to the first loan disbursement\n\n146.\nare that\n\nagreements will have been signed between the Government and the participating\nNGOs,  setting  out  the  terms  of  cooperation  for  project  implementation,  the\nsubdistricts  in  which  particular  NGOs  will  be  active,  the  parameters  for\ndetermining  the  on-lending  rate  from  NGOs  to  participating  farmers  and  the\ntarget  number  of  farmer  participants  which  each  NGO  will  aim  to  bring  into  the\nProject;\n\nfor \nloan\nthe  crop  production  and  agribusiness  components,  subsidiary \nagreements  will  have  been  signed  between  the  Bangladesh  Bank  and  RAKUB,\nsetting  out  the  terms  and  conditions  for  lending  from  the  Bangladesh  Bank  to\nRAKUB and from RAKUB to the NGOs;

Of the first two, satisfactory agreements were reached\non  improvement  of  farmer  access  to  production  credit  through  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs)  and  to  planning  for  O&M  of  market  infrastructure  to  be  developed  under  the  Project.\nThis  appendix  provides  details  on  the  unresolved  issues  and  the  steps  agreed  to  be  taken  in\nregard to agricultural input policies.\n\nA.\n\nFertilizer Pricing and Marketing\n\nDuring  project  preparation,  the  Government  clarified  that  the  appointment  of  fertilizer\n2.\ndealerships for specific geographic areas was undertaken in response to a crisis situation that\ndeveloped  in  1994-1995  after  the  completion  of  the  policy  measures  on  the  Foodcrops\nDevelopment Program (FDP).1 One of the FDP measures was to allow any private individual to\npurchase urea in bulk directly from Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) fertilizer\nfactories.  According  to  the  Government,  a  cartel  bought  up  large  volumes  of  urea  and  was\ncontrolling  the  market  and  the  retail  price.  To  exacerbate  the  situation,  world  urea  prices\nreached  very  high  levels  in  1994-1995  and  large  amounts  of  urea  were  exported  to  take\nadvantage  of  these  prices.  This  led  to  severe  shortages  within  the  country  and  especially  in\nsome  of  the  more  isolated  regions,  and  turned  into  a  major  political  and  economic  crisis.  The\nGovernment  clarified  that  the  present  fertilizer  marketing  system  has  evolved  in  consultation\nwith the private fertilizer dealers association and no urea shortage has since been reported from\nany part of the country. At the same time, the Government recognized that this matter was of\nconcern to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other external agencies.\n\n3.\nThe  situation  pertaining  to  the  urea  subsidy  is  more  complex  than  that  of  distribution.\nProviding  inputs  for  agricultural  production  at  subsidized  prices  is  a  stated  policy  of  the  current\nparty  in  power.  Also,  analysis  of  the  financial  subsidy  on  urea  is  difficult  since  most  of  the  urea\nused in the country is produced in Government-owned factories, which set their own pricing. It is\nalso difficult to determine exactly what the financial subsidy is, due to the differential pricing in the\ncountry for natural gas the main raw material for urea production. The Government acknowledged\nthat imported urea is being subsidized to bring prices into line with local BCIC prices, but noted\nthat imported urea accounted for only 5-10 percent of the national consumption. Moreover, it felt\nthat  to  bring  BCIC  prices  in  line  with  world  market  prices  was  not  necessarily  desirable  since\nthese prices tend to fluctuate unpredictably.\n\n4.\nThe  Government  also  noted  that  Bangladesh  is  a  member  of  the  World  Trade\nOrganization  (WTO)  and  a  signatory  to  its  agreements.  WTO  rules  allow  agriculture  sector\nsubsidies  of  up  to  10  percent  of  the  production  value  of  the  sector.  In  Bangladesh,  agriculture\nsector subsidies currently amount to less than 3 percent of the sector\u2019s total production value and,\nthus, are viewed as being compliant with WTO agreements.\n\nGiven  the  economic  and  political  importance  of  urea  in  the  agricultural  economy  of\n5.\nBangladesh, resolution of these issues will require persistent effort on the part of ADB and other\nagencies. Nonetheless, the Government agreed during the Project\u2019s preparation to reexamine the\nwhole question of fertilizer dealerships and consider any changes that may be required to improve\nthe efficiency of fertilizer supply to farmers.\n\n1 PPA: BAN 22217: Food Crops Development Program, December 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nB.\n\nSeed Marketing\n\n6.\nOn  the  question  of  seed,  the  Government  has,  in  contradiction  to  the  provisions  of  the\nFDP,  retained  a  role  in  retailing  crop  seed  through  Bangladesh  Agriculture  Development\nCorporation (BADC). The Government\u2019s view is that, given the slow development of private seed\nproduction and trade, this measure is essential to ensure a secure seed supply in isolated regions\nof  the  country.  The  Government  explained  that  it  was,  however,  willing  to  review  the  need  for\nthese retail sales in the project area in the light of the construction of the Jamuna bridge, which\nhas alleviated the isolation of a large part of the country. On the seed notification process, it was\nclarified  that  except  for  the  five  notified  seeds  (rice,  wheat,  sugar,  jute,  and  potato),  all  import,\nproduction,  and  marketing  of  seeds  was  open.  On  notified  seeds,  the  approved  varieties  were\nopen but imports of new varieties required permission, testing and verification, for which a system\nhas  been  put  in  place.  In  the  context  of  the  crops  to  be  promoted  under  the  Project,  seed\nnotification  is  of  concern  only  for  potato.  Overall,  BADC\u2019s  role  in  the  domestic  seed  market  is\nminor, comprising only an estimated 6.5 percent of the total trade.2\n\nC.\n\nSpecific Agreed Actions\n\n7.\nOther funding agencies in the sector have had extensive discussions with the Government\non these matters over the past few years.  Some progress on the issues could be expected, but\nthe question of urea subsidy was unlikely to be resolved in the near future, due as much to the\ncomplexity and uncertainty about the size and nature of the subsidy as anything else. ADB action\non these policy issues will need to be closely coordinated with other agencies. The World Bank\nhas  ongoing  discussions  on  all  of  the  issues  with  the  Government  under  a  policy-based\nagriculture and rural development program loan that is likely to be processed by the third quarter\nof  2001.  Seed  and  fertilizer  production  and  marketing  policies  have  been  specifically  flagged\nunder this loan, which will be prepared in consultation with ADB.\n\n8.\nWith regard to specific actions on the fertilizer and seed issues, as a result of discussions\nduring appraisal, the Government has agreed to (i) complete a full review of the existing BADC\nretail  seed  outlets  by  30  June  2001  and  inform  ADB  of  the  outcome  and  a  timetable  for  further\naction;  (ii)  have  an  independent  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  fertilizer  distribution\nsystem completed by 30 June 2001 and inform ADB of the outcome and actions planned to be\ntaken;  and  (iii)  review  the  mechanism  for  seed  import,  testing,  and  approval  in  order  to  identify\ninefficiencies  and  suggest  streamlined  procedures  that  will  encourage  greater  private  sector\nparticipation and improve flow of new seed varieties into the country.\n\n2 PPA: BAN 22217: Food Crops Development Program, December 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nPARTICIPATING FINANCE AGENCIES\n\n1.\nUnder  the  Project  credit  will  be  provided  to  small-scale  farmers  from  four  large\nestablished  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  all  of  which  are  currently  working  with  the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  (under  similar  arrangements  as  proposed  for  the  Project),  to\nhelp  implement  the  Participatory  Livestock  Development  Project  in  the  same  Project  area.\nFunds  for  the  NGOs  will  be  channeled  from  Bangladesh  Bank  through  the  Rajshahi  Krishi\nUnnayan  Bank  (RAKUB),  a  specialized  agricultural  development  bank  servicing  the  northwest\nregion.  Pertinent  information  on  the  NGOs,  Bangladesh  Bank,  and  RAKUB  is  provided  in  this\nappendix.\n\nA. \n\nThe Credit Channeling Agencies\n\n1. \n\nBangladesh Bank\n\n2.\nThe  Bangladesh  Bank  is  the  apex  of  the  country\u2019s  financial  system  and  serves  as  its\ncentral  bank.  It  is  the  authority  primarily  responsible  for  monetary  management  and  for\nestablishing  relevant  rules  and  issuing  related  directives  to  financial  institutions.  These  mainly\nrelate  to  licensing,  interest  rates,  liquidity,  loan  classification,  credit  and  capital  adequacy.\nBangladesh  Bank  also  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  planning  and  execution  of  credit\nprograms  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  declared  agricultural  credit  policy  and  priorities.\nThrough the specialized agricultural development banks, the Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB) and\nRAKUB,  Bangladesh  Bank  provides  a  refinance  facility  at  preferential  interest  rates  to\nencourage the disbursement of credit to the agriculture sector.\n\n3.\nTwo of Bangladesh Bank\u2019s departments are active in agricultural credit. The Agricultural\nCredit  Project  Department  is  responsible  for  implementing,  monitoring,  and  supervising\nagriculture  sector  projects  financed  with  foreign  credit  and  grant  assistance.  The  Agriculture\nCredit  Department  is  responsible  for  agriculture  policy  issues  and  conducts  performance\nassessments of private and nationalized commercial banks\u2019 agricultural lending activities as well\nas  those  of  the  specialized  agricultural  development  banks.  Bangladesh  Bank  has  its  head\noffice  and  two  branch  offices  in  Dhaka,  and  seven  other  branch  offices,  in  Barisal,  Bogra,\nChittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. The bank had 6,178 staff at the end of the\nFY1999.\n\n4.\nBangladesh  Bank  used  to  act  mainly  as  a  conduit  for  channeling  funds  to  the  banking\nsystem; however, subsequently it adopted a more proactive role in project implementation. The\nbank  was  to  have  been  the  executing  agency  for  ADB\u2019s  Agricultural  and  Rural  Credit  Project,\nand, as such, would have been responsible for implementation of policy reforms in the financial\nand  agricultural  credit  sectors.  However,  the  Project  was  not  implemented  due  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s  failure  to  meet  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness.  Currently,  among  project\nactivities, Bangladesh Bank supervises the activities of other banks that are providing credit for,\ninter  alia:  semi-intensive  shrimp  cultivation  and  shrimp  culture  development,  establishment  of\ncottage  industries  and  agri-businesses  in  the  private  sector;  programs  for  supporting  banana\nplantations, salt mills, and rural transport; and cyclone relief.\n\n5.\nBangladesh Bank is familiar with the requirements for implementing externally assisted\nprojects.  It  has  been  the  executing  agency  for  several  ADB-financed  projects,  including  the\nSecond  Aquaculture  Development  Project  and  the  North-West  Rural  Development  Project.\nThese  projects  commenced  in  the  1980s  and  have  subsequently  closed  although  recovery  of\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\ncredit  to  subprojects  financed  by  these  loans  continues  under  the  direction  of  the  Bangladesh\nBank.\n\nIrrigation  Project  and \n\nMore  recent  projects  executed  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank  include  the  ADB-financed\n6.\nthe  Marginal  and  Small  Farms  System  Crop\nNortheast  Minor \nIntensification Project in the Kurigram District of the northwest region. The first project, approved\nin 1991, provides a credit facility for private equipment dealers to finance small-scale irrigation\nequipment. The second, which commenced operations in 1987, is financed by the International\nFund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  with  the  German  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ).\nFunds  are  channeled  through  participating  financial  institutions,  including  RAKUB,  to  increase\nagricultural production and develop financial status of marginal and small-scale farmers.\n\n2. \n\nRajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank (RAKUB)\n\n7.\nRAKUB  was  established  under  the  President\u2019s  Ordinance  No.  LVIII  of  1986.  It  began\noperations  in  1987,  when  it  was  split  off  from  the  Bangladesh  Krishi  Bank  and  took  over  its\noperations  and  assets  that  were  within  the  Rajshahi  administrative  division  of  the  northwest\nregion of the country.\n\n8.\nRAKUB\u2019s head office is in the city of Rajshahi, which is about 280 kilometers northwest\nof Dhaka. RAKUB manages an extensive network of 300 branches in the northwest region as\nwell  as  one liaison and deposit-taking branch office in Dhaka. RAKUB plans to open 30  more\nbranches  in  the  northwest  region  in  the  near  future.  Activities  of  the  branches  are  supervised\nand  controlled  by  18  field-level  offices  that  undertake  internal  audit  functions  of  the  smaller\nbranch offices. RAKUB has 3,736, staff of whom 1,674 are professional staff officers. RAKUB\nbranches  offer  a  range  of  commercial  banking  services  including  acceptance  of  deposits,\nremittance of funds, and foreign exchange dealings.\n\nRAKUB\u2019s  lending  is  specialized  for  agricultural  purposes,  with  60  percent  of  its  loans\n9.\nportfolio in crop lending. Fisheries, livestock, irrigation, and farm machinery are also important\nlending  activities.  RAKUB  has  a  small  program  of  financing  collateral-free  microcredit  for\nemployment  generation  and  poverty  alleviation  in  conjunction  with  Rajshahi/Dingajpur  Rural\nServices  in  the  Kurigram  District.  It  has  also  recently  embarked  on  promotion  of  agro-based\nindustries  for  the  preservation,  processing,  and  marketing  of  primary  production.  RAKUB  has\nprovided loans for cold storage, packaging, and transport for distribution of produce as well as\nfor poultry, dairy, fertilizer blending, and engineering workshop projects.\n\n10.\nThough  faced  with  severe  financial  problems  nearly  since  its  creation,  the  financial\nperformance  of  RAKUB  has  improved  significantly  since  a  change  in  management  and\nreplacement  of  some  board  directors  in  mid-1999.  After  7  years  of  losses  and  an  ever-\nincreasing portfolio of bad debts, the financial statements for fiscal year June 2000 although as\nyet unaudited, show a small profit and an improvement in the number and amount of classified\nloans.\n\nTo address its lack of a performing loans, RAKUB management set a target to increase\n11.\nlending by 20 percent per annum over a five-year reform period and to increase the number of\nnew  borrowers  by  20  percent.  The  aim  was  also  to  diversify  the  loan  portfolio  with  targets  for\nincreased  lending  to  priority  sectors  other  than  crop  production.  RAKUB  achieved  this  target\nduring the first year it was set and, despite a shortfall in some of the selected priority sectors, its\nperformance was significantly better than in the previous year. This will ultimately lead to greater\ndiversification of the loans portfolio.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\n12.\nIn  an  attempt  to  recover  the  Tk8.4  billion  of  the  nonperforming  loans  on  its  books,\nRAKUB  set  a  target  of  20  percent  recovery  per  annum  and  embarked  on  a  loan  collection\nincentive program known by the acronym, \u201cMIRACLE\u201d which stands for \u201cmaximum recovery of a\nclassified loan entirely.\u201d One of the main features of the program is that any RAKUB employee\nis eligible to participate in the recovery of classified loans. An employee who is instrumental in\nthe closure of a classified loan and the recovery of all outstanding principal and interest on the\nloan,  receives  10  percent  of  the  realized  interest.  In  the  first  year  of  the  program,  a  target  of\nTk1.68 billion was set for recovery and of this target Tk1.07 billion was achieved. While this is\nonly  64  percent  of  the  target  set,  it  is  more  than  four  times  the  previous  year\u2019s  collection\nperformance when only Tk0.25 billion worth of classified loans were recovered.\n\n13.\nAs  at  the  end  of  FY1998,  RAKUB  was  indebted  to  the  Bangladesh  Bank  by  Tk10.4\nbillion.  This  came  about  through  the  previous  management\u2019s  practice  of  financing  much  of\nRAKUB\u2019s  operations  and  disbursements  out  of  funds  received  from  the  Bangladesh  Bank\nrefinance facility. This unsustainable practice has been discontinued under the reform program.\nIn  the  first  year  of  the  program,  RAKUB  did  not  draw  any  funds  from  the  Bangladesh  Bank\nrefinance facility and repaid Tk32.6 million of its outstanding debt. This compares favorably with\nprevious  years  when  the  debt  to  the  Bangladesh  Bank  continued  to  grow  with  funds  drawn\ngreatly exceeding repayments. RAKUB set a target of 10 percent net increase of deposits per\nannum. This was to be achieved through measures including the promotion of small saving and\nteacher\u2019s  saving  schemes.  The  first  year\u2019s  target  deposit  increase  was  Tk1.1  billion  against\nwhich  Tk1.03  billion  was  achieved.  This  is  a  94  percent  achievement  and  compares  to  a\nrelatively small increase in the previous year of only Tk0.17 billion. The deposit balance at the\nend of FY1999 was Tk5.05 billion compared to Tk3.67 billion FY1998.\n\n14.\nFinally, steps have been taken during RAKUB\u2019s first year of a reform program to initiate\nimprovements  in  conditions,  staff  management,  and  training.  These  include  an  attempt  to\nexpedite  the  resolution  of  personnel  matters  including  the  timely  preparation  of  annual\nperformance  assessments,  delegation  of  personnel  functions  to  the  branches,  preparation  of\nnew job descriptions, and implementation of a new training and career development program.\n\nB.\n\nThe Nongovernment Organizations\n\n1. \n\nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)\n\n15.\nBRAC is the country\u2019s largest NGO. It was founded in 1972 as a relief agency and has\nevolved  in  to  a  large,  multifaceted  development  organization  with  the  objectives  of  \u201cpoverty\nreduction and empowerment of the poor.\u201d\n\n16. With a membership of 3.3 million households in all 64 of the country\u2019s districts in 1999,\nan  annual  budget  of  $131  million,  and  a  full-time  staff  of  24,700,  BRAC  truly  is  a  national\ninstitution.\n\n17.\nBRAC\u2019s  ongoing  activities  cover  several  programs  including  a  rural  development\nprogram  (aimed  primarily  at  the  landless  and  particularly  landless  women),  an  education\nprogram, a health and nutrition program, an agriculture program, a microenterprise lending and\nassistance program, and an urban poor program. It operates primarily through group formation\nand mobilization for training and for the provision of microcredit to finance productive activities.\nBy the end of 1999, its cumulative disbursement of credit (from 1979) amounted to $965 million\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nand  in  1999  alone  it  disbursed  $219  million,  of  which  $141  million  is  still  outstanding.  The\nhistorical  repayment  rate  is  98  percent.  Members  groups  savings  are  $58  million,  and  the\nlending rate for credit is 15 percent.\n\nOf particular interest to the Project is BRAC\u2019s agriculture program. This program consists\n18.\nof  the  long-running  vegetable  program,  which  has  been  expanded  to  include  assistance  in\ngrowing rice, wheat and maize; the social forestry program; the vegetable export program; the\nseed production and marketing program; and the tissue culture laboratory. This program trains\nagriculture  extension  workers  (many  of  whom  are  women)  to  assist  village  organization\nmembers and small-scale farmers by providing training and technical assistance, and supplying\ninputs  such  as  high  quality  seed  and  disease  free  seedlings.  In  1999,  this  program  employed\n8,525 village extension workers who assisted 111,160 village organization members and 50,757\nsmall-scale  farmers  to  grow  vegetables,  rice,  maize,  and  wheat.  Moreover,  BRAC\u2019s  seed\nproduction program distributed 99 tons of 22 different kinds of vegetable seed, 100,000 potato\nmicrotubers,  and  500,000  banana  plantlets.  Contract  growers  also  supplied  potatoes,  chillies,\nand a range of vegetable crops for export to Singapore and Europe.\n\n19.\nIn  the  past  few  years,  BRAC\u2019s  management  has  made  a  policy  decision  to  begin  to\ntarget  not  only  the  landless  and  marginal  segments  of  society,  but  also  the  poor  small-scale\nfarmer,  in  the  realization  that  this  segment  of  society  (to  date  neglected  in  terms  of  credit\nprovision) will provide much of the economic growth in the rural areas.\n\nBRAC is well-represented in the project area, with active programs in every district and\n\n20.\ntraining facilities in Dinajpur.\n\n2. \n\nPROSHIKA Manavik Kendra\n\n21.\nPROSHIKA is the country\u2019s second largest NGO. Established in 1976 PROSHIKA has a\nsimilar mandate to BRAC but in practice has a somewhat narrower focus on the landless and\nmarginal  landholding  groups.  It  also  has  a  focus  on  group  formation  and  mobilization  and  its\nmembership  comprises  51,713  women\u2019s  groups  and  35,947  men\u2019s  groups  with  a  total\nhousehold  membership  of  about  1.7  million  (or  about  7  million  beneficiaries).  PROSHIKA  is\nactive in 50 of the country\u2019s 64 districts (including all of the project area), has a total staff of over\n4,000, almost all of whom are field staff, and an annual budget of close to $100 million. In 1998,\nPROSHIKA  disbursed  $56  million  in  credit  to  33,000  of  its  member  households  and  has\ncumulatively  (since  inception)  disbursed  $189  million.  In  comparison  with  BRAC,  PROSHIKA\nhas a lower emphasis on microcredit provision and a greater emphasis on group formation and\neducation and training.\n\n22.\nPROSHIKA  has  a  wide  range  of  programs.  These  include  a  universal  education\nprogram,  an  employment  and  income  generating  program,  an  environmental  protection  and\nregeneration program, a health and education program, an urban poor program, and a disaster\nmanagement  program.  Of  importance  for  the  Project  are  the  employment  and  income\ngeneration program and the environmental protection and regeneration program, which include\nfisheries  development,  sericulture,\nactivities  such  as \napiculture, and ecological agriculture. The ecological agriculture component includes ecological\ncropping based on farming without chemical fertilizer and pesticides, and homestead gardening.\nTo date, 537,000 farmers have been trained in ecologically sound cropping practices and these\npractices  have  been  successfully  implemented  on  about  50,000  hectares  (ha)  of  crop  land.\nMoreover,  through  homestead  gardening  training,  about  62,000  members  were  trained  in\nvegetable and fruit production in 1998-1999 alone. PROSHIKA also has a seed production and\n\nlivestock  development, \n\nirrigation, \n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\nmarketing  program  for  vegetable  seed.  Like  BRAC,  PROSHIKA  is  well-represented  in  every\ndistrict of the project area.\n\n3. \n\nGrameen Krishi Foundation (GKF)\n\n23.\nThe  GKF  is  an  offshoot  of  the  Grameen  Bank,  set  up  in  1991  to  take  over  privatized\ntubewells  from  the  Bangladesh  Agriculture  Development  Board  and  the  Bangladesh  Water\nDevelopment  Board  and  run  them  as  cooperative  farms  owned  by  landless  and  marginal\nfarmers. GKF is very much agriculture oriented in its outlook and includes among its objectives\nthe  following:  \u201c(i)  to  increase  income  and  employment  within  the  rural  sector  for  men  and\nwomen;  (ii)  to  enable  the  poor  to  gain  equitable  access  to  the  use  of  irrigation  and  other\nagricultural equipment for productive purposes; (iii) to enhance crop diversification for effective\nutilization  of  under-utilized  fallow  land;  (iv)  to  promote  private  sector  seed  production  at  farm\nlevel;  (v)  to  provide  credit  for  crop  production  and  for  both  on-farm  and  off-farm  activities  for\nlandless,  marginal  and  small  farmers;  (vi)  to  promote  marketing  of  mostly  non-traditional  and\nalso traditional crops at home and abroad.\u201d\n\n24.\nUnlike  BRAC  and  PROSHIKA,  GKF  covers  only  a  limited  target  area:  14  districts,\nincluding part of the project area. Within this area, GKF has 18,000 groups comprising 90,000\nmembers and who cultivate about 50,000 ha either individually or collectively. Of these 90,000\nmembers,  85,000  currently  have  loans.  GKF  has  disbursed  about  $10  million  in  loans  with  a\n99.5 percent recovery rate. Group fund savings total just over $1.1 million. GKF\u2019s program is run\nby a staff of about 1,200 with an annual budget in 1999 of about $436,000.\n\nGKF\u2019s  field  program  is  crop  production  oriented  although  it  does  include  livestock\n25.\ndevelopment. One of the most relevant aspects of the agency\u2019s work, with regard to the Project,\nis  an  emphasis  on  crop  diversification.  Of  the  approximately  50,000  ha  in  production  under\nGKF\u2019s  guidance,  about  13,000  ha  was  in  non-rice  crops,  primarily,  vegetables,  potatoes,  and\nfruits.  GKF  is  also  active  in  the  promotion  and  production  of  improved  seed  for  a  range  of\nvegetables, fruit, and hybrid maize.\n\n4. \n\nRangpur/Dinajpur Rural Services (RDRS)\n\n26.\nRDRS  was  set  up  in  1971  by  the  Lutheran  World  Fellowship.  In  1976,  a  sectoral\ndevelopment program was devised to assist the \u201cpoorest of the poor\u201d in agriculture, community\ndevelopment,  health,  and  women\u2019s  economic  activities  while  at  the  same  time  continuing  a\nconstruction  program  for  roads,  bridges,  markets,  and  schools.  In  1988,  RDRS  divided  its\nactivities  into  a  Rural  Works  Project  (concentrating  on  infrastructure)  and  a  Comprehensive\nProject  with  a  stress  on  social,  educational,  and  economic  factors.  RDRS  still  has  strong  ties\nwith  its  original  international  NGO  founders  and  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  bilateral  and\ninternational  NGO  funding  for  its  programs.  It  is  currently  involved  in  31  bilaterally  funded\nprojects with donors ranging from the Republic of Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany\nto the World Food Program and Japan. Its current program amounts to about $38 million, which\nis substantial given the limited area of operation (29 subdistricts).\n\n27.\nRDRS  works  through  groups  of  representatives  of  poor  households,  which  receive\nawareness training, skills training, and credit distribution for income generating activities. RDRS\nhas about 280,000 group members. In 1999, about $67 million was disbursed to about 110,000\nborrowers,  including  about  2,000  small-scale  farmers.  (Notably,  about  3,400  participants  in\nADB\u2019s Participatory Livestock Development Project received microfinance from RDRS in 1999).\nHistorically, the repayment rate for microcredit loans has been about 92 percent.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 4, page 6\n\n28.\nRDRS  has  a  range  of  programs  from  education  to  health  and  disaster  preparedness,\nand is active in agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Of particular relevance to the Project is an\nIFAD-financed project in Kurigram and Thakurgaon districts which is expanding the basic RDRS\ngroup  work  to  small-scale  farmers,  focusing  on  farms  of  0.5-1.2  ha.  RDRS\u2019s  publications\nacknowledge the need to work with farmers in this landholding group and the institution intends\nto expand work with its small-scale farmer groups.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\n\nTable A4.1: Project Cost Estimates\n($'000)\n\nComponent\nA.

Women from small-scale farm families in the project area work on the family farms\nin different agriculture activities. Their work in the agriculture field covers all activities from seed\nto  harvest.    Women  are  also  managing  grain  storage  and  processing  and  fruit  and  vegetable\nproduction,  especially  in  and  around  their  homesteads.    In  some  nongovernment  organization\n(NGO)  programs  in  the  project  area,  women  participate  in  seed,  sunflower,  and  maize\nproduction.  Given  that  women  are  significantly  involved  in  crop  production,  the  Project  is\ndesigned  with  specific  mechanisms  and  features  to  facilitate  and  ensure  full  participation  of\nwomen in the Project.\n\nPrior  to  the  commencement  of  project  activities,  the  gender  specialist,  in  coordination\n2.\nwith  the NGOs, will develop  and supervise a gender assessment in the project area, focusing\nespecially  on  the  high  value  crops  selected  for  promotion  under  the  Project.  This  assessment\nwill  gather  first  hand  information  on  gender  division  in  production  activities  relevant  to  the\nProject. Field observations and interviews will be conducted with both men and women farmers.\n\n3.\nBased  on  the  outcome  of  this  assessment,  a  gender  strategy  will  be  prepared  for  the\nmobilization  and  group  formation  of  farmers,  both  men  and  women.  The  number  of  mixed  or\nseparate  groups  will  be  determined  based  on  the  findings  of  the  gender  assessment.  The\ngender strategy will also determine the type of extension training to be provided to the women.\n\n4.\nIn  the  village-based  training  to  be  provided  under  the  Project,  the  Department  of\nAgriculture Extension and the NGOs will ensure that women farmers working in the project area\nare adequately targeted and represented.\n\n5.\n The Project includes a gender consultant to be placed in the project management unit to\ndesign  and  undertake  the  initial  gender  assessment  in  the  Project  area,  and  design  the\nimplementation strategy and the monitorable indicators for ensuring women\u2019s full participation in\nproject activities.\n\nThe  village-based  training  and  extension  services  will  be  specifically  designed  to  meet\n\n6.\nthe needs of the women farmers.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Rationale\n\n1.\n\nThe Northwest Crop Diversification Project is justifiable on the following grounds:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEquity. The northwest region remains one of the poorest regions in the country.\n\nMarket  Failure.  Public  services:  varietal  information,  production  technology,  and\naccess  to  credit  are  lacking  for  small-scale  farmers.  The  Project  will  focus  on\nsuch farmers as they have the land resources needed to raise high value crops\n(HVCs) but are not served by the existing microcredit and formal credit programs.\nThe marketing support component will increase competition, increase marketing\nopportunities,  reduce  postharvest  losses,  and  increase  farmers\u2019  knowledge  of\nproduce prices.\n\nComplementary  Externalities.  (nonquantifiable)  The  Project  will  enhance  the\nimpact of other ADB projects in the region, e.g., the Jamuna Bridge Project, Third\nRural Infrastructure Development Project, Horticulture Development Project, and\nParticipatory Livestock Development Project.\n\nOther  Effects.  (nonquantifiable)  The  Project  will  also  benefit  the  region\u2019s\neconomy  as  a  whole  due  to  increased  labor  demand  and  overall  regional\nnutritional  status  as  new  and  more  nutritious  vegetables  and  fruits  become\navailable at accessible prices.\n\nB. \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries\n\n2.\nThe main quantifiable benefits arising from the Project are increased HVC production by\nfarmers  who  are  expected  to  undergo  training  and  take  production  loans.  Other  economic\nbenefits  accruing  from  the  Project  but  that  are  not  quantified  include  reduced  losses  and\nmarketing  costs  through  improvements  to  growers\u2019  markets,  reduced  costs  of  marketing  and\nhigher  produce  values  at  village  markets,  and  increased  production  from  farmers  who  do  not\nparticipate in the project but adopt HVC production. Most of people who take loans and benefit\nfrom higher crop production will be small-scale farming households with holdings of 0.2 to 1.2\nhectares  (ha).    Approximately  160,000  small-scale  farm  households  are  expected  to  directly\nbenefit from crop diversification, training, extension, and credit under the Project. It is difficult to\nprecisely  quantify  the  number  of  the  households  who  will  benefit  from  the  renovation  and\nupgrading  of  primary  and  growers\u2019  markets,  although  these  will  include  much  of  the  general\npopulation living near these facilities.\n\n3.\nSeven  years  after  project  implementation,  the  Project\u2019s  field  activities  will  give  rise  to\nproduction of approximately 370,000 tons of HVC per annum which, after deducting the value of\nrice  taken  out  of  production,  will  have  an  incremental  value  estimated  at  $27.9  million.  At  the\nend  of  the  Project,  the  field  activities  will  generate  an  additional  4.4  million  labor-days  of\nemployment per annum.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nC. \n\nSector Policy Context\n\n4.\nThe  Government  agricultural  policy  on  some  issues  has  been  reversed  from  the\nagreements  for  the  Food  Crops  Sector  Program  (FCP),  especially  those  related  to  fertilizer\nsubsidy,  publicly  controlled  marketing  of  fertilizer  and  public  sector  seed  production.  These\nissues will have to be addressed in coordination with other agencies such as World Bank, but\nthe outcome will affect the economic viability of the Project only marginally at best (See paras.\n43-47 in the main text).\n\n5.\nOn rural finance, the Agricultural Credit Department of Bangladesh Bank has confirmed\nthat there is no interest rate ceiling or restriction of eligibility to agricultural credit in terms of farm\nsize.  Previously  imposed  restrictions  of  this  nature  have  been  removed,  and  the  interest  rate\nceiling was removed in July 1999. Currently, the Bangladesh Bank only issues yearly guidelines\nthat list indicative credit size per hectare depending on crop category, farm size, and farm input\nrequirements.\n\nD.\n\nComparative Advantage\n\n6.\nThe  northwest  region  has  large  tracts  of  flood-free  highlands  with  desired  agro-\necological  zones  and  good,  deep,  free-draining  lighter  textured  soils  ideally  suited  to  HVCs.\nSixty  target  subdistricts  have  been  selected  based  on  factors  including  altitude,  soil  condition,\navailability  of  irrigation  water,  farm  size  (land  holdings),  access  for  marketing  and  input\nprocurement, and current land use.\n\nFor  vegetables  and  spices,  while  some  of  the  districts  (Bogra,  Pabna,  and  parts  of\n7.\nRangpur)  in  the  northwest  have  started  growing  these  crops,  the  greater  districts  of  Dinajpur\nand  Rajshahi  and  more  northern  parts  of  Rangpur  offer  good  opportunities  for  diversification.\nThe  major  opportunity  gap  is  in  summer  vegetable  production  in  which  the  drier  and  cooler\nareas of the far north of the northwest region can excel. Also, the northwest should be able to\nproduce  earlier  crops  of  cool  season  vegetables.  A  recent  study1  shows  that  potatoes,\nvegetables, chillis, and onions provide high financial returns and have a comparative advantage.\nThese and other crops are being focused on under the Project.\n\n8.\nHybrid maize is considered very promising as a substitute for imports used in livestock\nfeed,  and  has  significant  potential  to  increase  farm  incomes.  The  ongoing  Participatory\nLivestock Development Project (started in early 1998) is expected to support more than 400,000\nsmall households raising poultry and cattle in the northwest and north-central regions. This will\ncreate a significant surge in demand for the animal feed. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs)\nsuch  as  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  (BRAC)  operate  their  own  processing\nfacilities for hybrid maize to support livestock enterprises.\n\n9.\nIn addition, fruits with good potential for commercial production in the northwest region\ninclude  banana,  coconut,  guava,  lemon,  lime,  lychee,  mandarin,  mango,  orange,  papaya,\npineapple, sapodilla, sweet tamarind, and sour tamarind. All of these fruits have a comparative\nadvantage  for  production  in  the  highland,  flood-free  areas  of  the  northwest.  Technical  and\nsocioeconomic  constraints  can  be  overcome  by  the  project  (based  on  available  information  in\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO, TA Report).\n\n                                                          \n1 Shahabuddin. 1999. Comparative Advantage in Bangladesh Agriculture.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nE.\n\nProject Design Features\n\n1. \n\nRealistic Packaging\n\n10.\nAgricultural processing and agribusiness was originally considered as one of the Project\ncomponents but has been scaled down to the level of a pilot activity.  A small line of credit will\nbe  extended  through  Rajshahi  Krishi  Unnayan  Bank  (RAKUB)  to  agribusiness  projects  that\ncomply  with  strict  eligibility  criteria.  This  will  test  the  feasibility  and  viability  of  some\nrepresentative  enterprises  and  test  the  implementation  and  institutional  arrangements  for\nagribusiness lending.\n\n2. \n\nMarketing Management\n\n11.\nPrevious  projects  in  Bangladesh  with  a  marketing  component  have  tended  to\nconcentrate  on  the  physical  improvement  of  market  infrastructure  without  due  attention  to\nmanagement  aspects.  This  approach  has  limited  the  benefits  to  growers.  The  Project  will\nsupport  strengthening  of  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  in  collecting,  collating,  and\ndisseminating  timely  and  accurate  information  on  markets  and  prices.  It  will  also  develop  and\nimplement improved market management systems.\n\n3. \n\nStrategic Beneficiary Targeting for Optimum Poverty Impact\n\n12.\nThe beneficiary target for the Project (farmers with landholdings of 0.2-1.2 ha) has taken\ninto  consideration  the  specific  rural  poverty  situation  in  Bangladesh.  The  rural  poor  in\nBangladesh  fall  into  three  distinct  bands  taking  into  consideration  the  key  indicators  of  per\ncapita  income,  land  ownership,  and  food  deficit  status:2  (i)  extreme  poor  (about  23  percent  of\nrural poor); (ii) moderate poor (about 29 percent), (iii) tomorrow\u2019s poor (about 21 percent). Thirty\nto forty percent of the third category, with land ownership of up to 0.6 ha, are said to be above\nthe income poverty line. But this group is vulnerable to income erosion pressures and in danger\nof descending into poverty as was the case for a sizable percentage of these households during\n1987-1994.  A  group  of  households  immediately  above  this  layer  (0.6-1.2  ha)  is  equally\nvulnerable. Only those who move upward from this category move away from danger of falling\nbelow  the  poverty  line.  The  Project  will  therefore  target  this  layer  of  the  poor  (0.2-1.2  ha),  of\nwhich  60-70  percent  are  below  the  income  poverty  line  or  in  danger  of  falling  below  it.  This\ngroup has not been served by NGO microcredit or by formal credit. More importantly, from the\nregional development perspective, this group is the entrepreneurial segment of the poor who will\nbe able to contribute to internally driven sustained regional economic growth once they have a\ngreater sense of security brought about by technical knowledge transfer. They are not averse to\ncommercial  development  of  HVCs,  as  has  been  shown  in  some  regions  in  the  northwest.\nMarketing  is  the  major  missing  link  to  realize  their  entrepreneurship  and  requires  the  type  of\nsupport provided by the Project.\n\nF.\n\nDemand Analysis\n\n1. \n\nDemand for HVCs\n\nBangladesh  is  a  large  net  importer  of  agricultural  produce.  1997  trade  statistics  1997\n13.\nshow  imports  of  HVCs  and  derived  processed  produce  at  about  $50  million.  Substantial\n\n                                                          \n2 Rahman, H.Z. 1995. Dynamics of Rural Poverty in Bangladesh (and interview in person).\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nquantities  of  HVCs  and  seeds,  including  less  perishable  items  such  as  potatoes  and  spices,\nenter  from  India  to  the  northwest  region  and  other  parts  of  Bangladesh,  indicating  significant\nroom for import substitution in the domestic markets. The economy has experienced an annual\ngrowth rate of 4-5 percent in recent years.  According to World Bank studies,3 most HVCs have\ndemand elasticities well above those for food grains and higher than for pulses and oils. Based\non demand elasticity, population, and income growth from the studies, the countrywide demand\nfor HVCs is projected to rise from the current 4.0-5.0 million tons per annum to 5.4-6.5 million\ntons  in  2007.  Using  the  same  parameters,  the  HVC  demand  in  the  northwest  region  will\nincrease from the current 1.9 million to 2.5 million tons.\n\n14.\nHVC production  from  the Project would build up gradually and is estimated at 370,000\ntons at full development in 2008, which would account for only about 6 percent of the projected\nnational  total  demand  and  about  15  percent  of  the  expected  total  demand  in  the  northwest\nregion. Currently most HVCs such as fruits, vegetables, and spices are consumed in and close\nto the production areas. While future market and price developments would determine the HVC\ncropping pattern, considering the small share of the incremental production from the Project in\nthe  expected  total  demand,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  Project  would  upset  long-term  price\ntrends.  Much  of  the  incremental  production  from  the  Project  is  therefore  expected  to  be\nabsorbed within the region. The extent of reduction in transaction costs associated with Jamuna\nbridge  and  other  marketing  network  developments  that  link  the  produce  from  the  northwest\nregion  to  Dhaka  and  Chittigong  urban  areas  has  yet  to  unfold.  Although  such  interregional\nmarketing will be a further benefit from the Project, for the time being it suffices to consider the\ndemand within the northwest region.\n\n2. \n\nDemand for Credit\n\n15.\nFarmers\u2019  credit  requirements  are  based  on  the  crop  budgets  and  farm  models  (paras.\n14-21).  Each  participating  household  on  average  could  increase  HVC  production  by  0.25\nhectares,  on  which  representative  HVCs  are  to  be  grown.  The  average  production  costs  per\n0.25  hectares  are  estimated  at  $102  (excluding  family-owned  labor  costs),  and  this  amount  is\ntaken  as  the  household  credit  requirement.  The  credit  disbursement  schedule  is  to  be\nsynchronized  with  the  farmers.  As  such,  the  credit  demand  flow  by  year  is  projected  in  Table\nA11.1, with the aggregate amount of $22.6 million, inclusive of price contingencies.\n\nTable A11.1:  Credit Requirements\n\nItem\n\nY2\n\nY3\n\nY4\n\nY5\n\nY6\n\nY7\n\nTotal\n\n16,000\n\n32,000\n\n40,000\n\n32,000\n\n24,000\n\n16,000\n\n160,000\n\n1,854\n\n4,023\n\n5,448\n\n4,714\n\n3,818\n\n2,745\n\n22,601\n\nNo. of Farmers\nTaking Credit\nCredit Required\n($\u2019000)\nSource: Mission estimates.\n\nY1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nG.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n16.\nIllustrative  crop  budgets  have  been  formulated  to  assess  the  profitability  of  individual\ncrops.  Project  cost  and  benefit  estimates  are  based  on  reasonable  assumptions  and  are  well\nbelow potential under ideal conditions using recommended technical packages.\n\n                                                          \n3 World Bank. 1995. Agriculture Growth with Diversification: Prospects and Issues. Washington, D.C.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nSubproject  financial  viability  was  estimated  based  on  a  yearly  production  cycle  with\n17.\nrecurrent incremental costs and revenues, and no major capital investments. Local values are\nconverted  into  foreign  exchange  equivalent  at  an  exchange  rate  of  Tk51/$1.  Labor  costs  are\nbased on the basic daily wage rate of Tk50 per day. For traded commodities, economic prices\nhave been estimated based on the World Bank's commodity price forecasts, projected to 2005\nin constant terms (Year 2000=1.0), with adjustments for local handling and transport costs.\n\n18.\nFarm model analysis was carried out to project incremental farm incomes and return to\nfamily labor on a selection of subprojects to be supported under the Project.  As it is difficult to\naccurately  predict,  the  composition  of  HVCs  that  the  participating  farmers  will  adopt,  six\nindicative farm models were evaluated. The analysis was carried out for farms of 1 ha and 0.5\nha size diversifying into HVCs and increasing cropping intensities from 180 percent without the\nProject to 200 percent with the Project. The HVCs are hybrid maize, hybrid potato, and mixed\nvegetable-spices cropping.\n\n19.\nHybrid  maize  was  selected  as  its  demand  is  expected  to  increase  with  an  increased\ndemand for livestock feed. Hybrid potatoes are already an important crop in the area and have a\ndemonstrated  comparative  advantage.  Mixed  vegetable-spices  have  been  included  to  indicate\nthe  average  performance  of  the  envisaged  potential  vegetable  and  spice  crops  that  could  be\nexpanded under the Project.  These include cabbage, chilli, onion, ginger, tumeric, string bean,\nradish, tomato, cucumber, and cauliflower.\n\n20.\nFarmers are expected to apply their own family labor on the farm which, on average, is\nequivalent  to  approximately  30  percent  of  the  total  subproject  cost.  For  the  balance  of  the\nsubproject cost (70 percent), loan financing for a period of six months with an average interest\nrate of 22 percent per annum, is assumed.\n\n21.\nAnalysis of the farm models indicate that labor requirements would increase by about 12\npercent to 355 days on 1 ha farms and by about 11 percent to 177 days on 0.5 ha farms. The\nincreases appear to be well within the capacity of typical small farm households to meet, which\nhave an average labor availability of 450-550 days. Seasonal farm labor is available for hire in\nthe project area during the months when labor requirements exceed the available family labor.\n\n22.\nThe  results  of  the  subproject  financial  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  A11.2.    As\nshown,  return  on  investment,  net  incomes,  and  returns  to  incremental  labor  applied  are\nprojected  to  be  proportionately  higher  for  farmers  with  the  smaller  (0.5  ha)  land  areas.    The\nassumption is that regardless of the farm size, diversification would take place on plot sizes of\n0.25 ha.  All farms would easily be able to service the debt incurred and provide a positive net\nfarm income after financing their respective subprojects.  After loan repayment, net incomes of\nfarmers  on  0.5  ha  landholdings  who  diversify  into  0.25  ha  of  HVC  increase  by  approximately\n$66 per annum (31 percent higher than those without the Project).  Net incomes of farmers with\n1 ha landholdings rise by approximately $91 per annum (21 percent higher than those without\nthe  Project).  The  projected  returns  on  investment  and  returns  to  additional  labor  applied  are\nsatisfactory for all subprojects analyzed.  In particular, the calculation of incremental income for\neach  additional  day  of  labor  applied  with  the  Project  shows  a  return  well  above  the  prevailing\ndaily wage rate for unskilled agricultural labor in all farm models.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\nTable A11.2: Summary of Subproject Analysis\n\nReturn on\nInvestment\n48 percent\n24 percent\n60 percent\n39 percent\n71 percent\n26 percent\n83 percent\n48 percent\n\nIncrease in Net\nFarm Income\n$71 (16%)\n$95 (22%)\n$106 (24%)\n$91 (21%)\n$46 (21%)\n$71 (33%)\n$82 (38%)\n$66 (31%)\n\nIncome per\nIncreased Labor-day\n$2.53\n$2.22\n$2.66\n$2.47\n$5.24\n$2.97\n$3.93\n$4.05\n\nSize of\nFarm\n\n1 ha\n\n0.5 ha\n\nHVC Enterprise\n\nMaize\nPotato\nVegetables/Spices\nAverage\nMaize\nPotato\nVegetables/Spices\nAverage\n\nHVC = high value crops.\nSource: mission estimates.\n\nH.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nEstimation of project economic viability was based on the assumption of a project life of\n23.\n20  years,  an  investment  period  of  7  years,  and  an  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12  percent.\nFinancial prices of nontraded commodities have been converted to economic prices by using a\nstandard  conversion  factor  (SCF)  of  0.89.  As  there  is  a  surplus  of  labor  in  the  project  area,\nshadow pricing of wage rates has been applied at 80 percent of the basic daily wage rate in the\nanalysis.\n\n24.\nIncremental  economic  benefits  for  each  farm  model  were  assessed  using  economic\nprices.  Tradable  inputs  and  outputs  were  based  on  import  or  export  parity  prices,  and\nnontradable  components  of  inputs  and  outputs  were  adjusted  using  the  standard  conversion\nfactor  of  0.89.  Taxes,  duties,  and  contingencies  were  also  deducted.  The  results  were\naggregated  based  on  expectations  of  the  frequency  of  adoption  of  each  type  of  diversification\nstrategy and the size distribution derived from the 1996 agricultural census.\n\n25.\nThe overall project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 30.7 percent,\nindicating economic viability. This is based wholly on the quantifiable benefits derived from the\ncomponent  for  farmer  mobilization  and  credit.  The  benefits  of  the  noncredit  components  are\nlargely nonquantifiable and in some cases would apply to a wider range of project beneficiaries.\nNevertheless,  a  major  portion  of  the  economic  costs  of  these  components  was  added  to  the\nquantifiable  costs  and  benefits  of  the  credit  component  to  arrive  at  the  overall  project  EIRR.\nNoncredit  costs  wholly  related  to  the  Project,  such  as  the  costs  of  project  management,  were\nfully included in the analysis, while components with a wider range of beneficiaries are included\nat a level proportionate to their assumed contribution to the Project. In the case of the training\nand  extension  component,  about  40  percent  of  the  costs  are  for  the  formulation  of  training\ncourses  and  the  production  of  training  materials.  Assuming  half  of  this  amount  has  a  wider\napplication to other beneficiaries, only 80 percent of the total cost of this component is included\nin the analysis. Similarly, the cost of renovation and upgrading of primary and growers markets\nconstitutes  80  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  marketing  support  component.  Again,  assuming  that\nhalf of this cost can be applied to the benefit of others external to the Project, only 60 percent of\nthe cost of this component is included.  The same applies to the adaptive research component,\nwhere 40 percent of the cost has a wider application so that only 80 percent of the component\ncost  is  included  in  the  analysis.  While  there  would  presumably  be  net  incremental  benefits\nderived from the agribusiness credit component, given the pilot nature of this activity, there was\nno attempt to quantify these and the full cost of this component is included in the analysis.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 12, page 7\n\nI.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\n26.\nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  higher  costs  and  a  decline  in\nbenefits  on  the  Project.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  overall  Project  EIRR  are\nshown in Table A11.3.  Due in part to the inclusion of the costs of the noncredit components,\nwhich  constitute  a  major  portion  of  the  costs  in  the  early  years  of  project  implementation,  the\noverall project EIRR is sensitive to cost increases.  A 17.3 percent increase in costs would result\nin  an  EIRR  below  the  12  percent  threshold  opportunity  cost  of  capital.    The  Project  is  also\nsensitive  to  a  decline  in  benefits  with  a  13.2  percent  decline  resulting  in  an  EIRR  below  the\nthreshold  level.  In  the  unlikely  event  of  a  combination  of  a  10  percent  cost  overrun  and  a  10\npercent  decline  in  benefits,  the  Project  would  become  unviable.  Delays  in  the  realization  of\nbenefits however, do not have much impact on the project viability.\n\nTable A11.3: Results of Sensitivity Analysis, EIRR (%)\n\nDetails\n\nEIRR (%)\n\nSwitching Values\n(%)\n\nBase Case\n10% Cost Overrun\n10% Decline in Benefits\nCombination of Benefit\n   Decline and Cost Overrun\n1 year Delay in Benefits\n2 years Delay in Benefits\n\n30.7\n20.3\n 16.8\n        4.0\n\n  26.5\n  23.3\n\n17.3\n13.2\n\nSource:  Mission estimates.\n\nJ. \n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\n27.\nAs  discussed  in  the  main  text  (paras.  108-110)  large  incremental  operation  and\nmaintenance costs (O&M) are not envisaged. The major recurrent expenditures after the project\ninvestments  have  been  made  will  be  on  (i)  O&M  of  the  upgraded  horticulture  training  and\ndemonstration centers (HTDCs) and (ii) O&M for the primary and growers\u2019 markets. The Project\nwill cover O&M during the implementation period and evolve methods of self-financing after the\nProject. Similarly, market management improvements will focus on O&M.\n\n28.\nIn addition, sufficient government counterpart fund is expected to be allocated during the\nproject  implementation  period.  According  to  the  1999-2000  Development  Program,  Tk3,780\nmillion ($74 million) has been allocated for the crop subsector for implementation of 78 projects\n(64 investment projects and 14 technical assistance projects) in FY2000. Out of this amount, for\nexample, Tk106 million ($2.1 million) is allocated to the ADB-assisted Horticulture Development\nProject (which closed in 1999) against the total project cost budgeted at Tk1,795 million or $36\nmillion. For the proposed Project, the average Government counterpart fund, net of beneficiaries\ncontribution,  is  estimated  at  about  $1.5  million  per  annum  (total  $9.3  million).  This  is  smaller\nthan the Government funding allocated to the above project and therefore considered well within\nan affordable range in the portfolio of its crop subsector development plan for the coming years.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 October 2000)\n", "     Currency Unit\nTaka1.00\n      $1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Bangladesh Taka\n$0.0185185\nTk54.00\n", "In this report a rate of $1.00 = Tk53.75 has been used.
