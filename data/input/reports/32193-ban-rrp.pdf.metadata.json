The Project will\npromote the use of new crops and cropping techniques through\ntraining, extension, and credit provided by a partnership between\nthe  Government  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);\nupgrade market information services and market infrastructure;\npromote improved use of market facilities by the private sector;\nand  provide  a  pilot  credit  line  for  postharvest  agribusiness\nactivities. The project area covers 16 districts in the northwest\nregion and 3.2 million farmer households, more than half of whom\nare below the poverty line.\nClassification Primary       -    Poverty Reduction\nEnvironment Category     -    B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken. The\nsummary IEE is a supplementary appendix (available on request)\nto this report.\nRationale The northwest region is one of the Bangladesh's poorest and\nmost backward regions despite its favorable natural resources. It\nhas traditionally been at a disadvantage compared to other parts\nof the country due to its physical isolation, being separated from\nthe rest of the country by the Jamuna River to the east and the\nGanges to the south. The construction of the Jamuna bridge has\npartly  alleviated  this  physical  constraint,  and  presented  new\nopportunities  for  increasing  agriculture  production  and  the\nincomes of much of the population of the region. Moreover, much\nof the area is flood-free and characterized by well-drained soils,\nadequate  supplies  of  groundwater  for  irrigation  and  a  varied\nclimate that is suited to a greater range of crops than that in other\nregions. There is thus scope for diversification to high value crops\n(HVCs).\nThe present farming system is rice-based. Rice is grown in all\nthree cropping seasons, high yielding varieties cover more than\n80 percent of production, and cropping intensity is above 175\npercent. There is, thus, little scope for expanding the cropped\narea  or  the  cropping  intensity.  Future  income  enhancement\nopportunities for the farming community of this region therefore lie\nin crops that can provide a greater value of production per unit\narea, than can high yielding varieties of rice.\nFactors, in addition to physical isolation, that have constrained\ndiversification in the region and kept incomes low and stagnant\ninclude inadequate public research and extension on crops other\nthan rice; limited participation of NGOs and the private sector in", "iii\nagriculture  support  services;  farmers\u2019  lack  of  knowledge  of\nappropriate crops and varieties; their having inadequate access to\nplanting  material  and  production  technologies;  a  dearth  of\ninformation  on  market  potentials  and  prices;  and,  most\nimportantly, difficulties accessing production credit, especially for\nthe small-scale farmers.\nThe Project was thus designed to improve the farmers\u2019 income\nlevels  by  assisting  them  to  diversify  to  HVCs  without\ncompromising household food security. The Project will address\nmany of the identified constraints and reach a large number of\nfarmers with information and know-how needed to diversify to\nnew HVCs, with financial resources needed to purchase inputs\nand equipment, and with assistance to market their produce at\nbetter prices. This will benefit the participating farmers and the\nregion's economy as a whole; the labor market, due to increased\nlabor demand; and regional nutrition, as new and more nutritious\nvegetables and fruits become available.\nObjectives and The proposed Project is aimed at improving farm incomes and\nScope reducing poverty in the northwest region. The specific objectives\nare to promote production and more efficient marketing of HVCs\nand to build sustainable partnerships with and capacities of NGOs\nand the public sector agencies in agriculture extension and crop\nfinance.  Poverty  reduction  objectives  will  be  achieved  through\ndirect  improvement  in  incomes  for  project  participants  and\nincreased employment opportunities for nonparticipants, brought\nabout  by  additional  farm  labor  requirements  and  increased\ndemand for transportation and processing.\nThe project scope will include (i) farmer training and extension, (ii)\nfarmer  mobilization  and  credit,  (iii)  adaptive  research,  (iv)\nmarketing  support,  (v)  a  pilot  credit  line  for  postharvest\nagribusiness support, and (vi) support for project management.\nCost Estimates The  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $66.2  million  equivalent,\ncomprising about $19.5 million in foreign exchange and $46.7\nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.\n($ million)\nFinancing Plan ____________________________________________________\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\n_____________________________________________________\nADB   19.5   26.8 46.3 70\nGovernment     0.0     9.6   9.6 14\nBeneficiaries     0.0     10.3 10.3 16\n   Total   19.5   46.7 66.2           100\n____________________________________________________", "iv\nLoan Amount The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 35,710,000 ($46.3\nand Terms million) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources, with a maturity of\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest\ncharge of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nthereafter, to be paid semiannually.\nPeriod of Until 31 December 2008\nUtilization\nExecuting (i)  The  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE)  of  the\nAgencies Ministry of Agriculture\n(ii) Bangladesh Bank\nImplementation The DAE will be the principal Executing Agency responsible for the\nArrangements implementation  of  all  project  activities.  DAE  will  be  assisted  in\nproject implementation by the Department of Agricultural Marketing\n(DAM), the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED),\nand the selected NGOs.\nThe  Bangladesh  Bank  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and\nsupervising  the  credit  component.  It  will  channel  funds  to  the\nNGOs for crop finance operations and to the private entrepreneurs\nfor agribusiness pilot activities. Funds will be routed through a\nfinancing intermediary, which will initially be the Rajshahi Krishi\nUnnayan Bank (RAKUB). The arrangement will be reviewed during\nthe project period and the intermediary changed if necessary or\ndesirable. The NGOs will provide and supervise crop finance to\nparticipating small-scale farmers.\nOverall coordination among agencies will be achieved through a\nproject  coordination  and  steering  committee  chaired  by  the\nSecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture. A project management unit\n(PMU) will be established in DAE, which will be supported during\nthe  project  period  with  a  team  of  international  and  domestic\nconsultants, and some equipment and vehicles. Field activities will\nbe coordinated and monitored by two project supervision units to\nbe established in the region, under the regional additional directors\nof agriculture.\nProcurement All procurement under the Project will be done in accordance with\nADB's  Guidelines for Procurement,  including  local  competitive\nbidding.  The  major  items  to  be  procured  will  be  equipment,\nmaterials,  services,  and  a  modest  amount  of  civil  works.  All\nprocurement  will  generally  be  undertaken  by  the  PMU  after\nagreement with the relevant implementing agency on the scope,\nnature, and specifications of items to be procured.", "v\nConsulting The project will require 582 person-months of consulting services\nServices consisting of 124 months of international and 458 months of local\nexpertise. Most of this expertise will be for the formulation of the\ntraining  programs  and  for  assistance  with  project  start-up  and\nmanagement.  All  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance  with  ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nSince specialized expertise will be required for formulating and\nimplementing training courses, consultants for this component will\nbe  recruited  as  a  team  from  a  reputed  agriculture  training\ninstitution,  possibly  in  combination  with  a  suitably  qualified\nconsulting firm.  All other consultants will be recruited as teams\nfrom qualified consulting firms, except that the adaptive research\nand  seed  verification  specialists,  because  of  the  nature  of\nexpertise required, will be recruited as individual consultants.\nEstimated Project 30 June 2008\nCompletion Date\nProject Project beneficiaries comprise about 160,000 farmers who own\nBeneficiaries and  operate  0.2-1.2  hectares.  The  Project  will  increase  their\nincomes by an average of $78, or more than 24 percent, per year\nthrough the production of HVCs. About half the farmers in this\nlandholding  category  are  poor.  The  Project  will  thus  have  a\nsignificant  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Field  activities  will\ngenerate about an additional 4.4 million labor-days of employment\nper annum.\nOther benefits arising from the Project but not quantified include\nreduced  postharvest  losses  and  marketing  costs  through\nimprovements to growers' markets, and increased production from\nfarmers  who  do  not  participate  in  the  Project  but  adopt  HVC\nproduction. This will have a positive impact on both off-farm and\non-farm  incomes  and  on  poverty  reduction.  Even  without  the\ninclusion of these benefits, the Project\u2019s economic internal rate of\nreturn is 30.7 percent.\nImplementation  risks  have  been  identified,  but  the  Project  has\nbeen designed with measures to mitigate them.  These measures\ninclude (i) the requirement that all farmers taking credit packages\nhave undergone training in HVC production, (ii) the provision of\nextension  support  by  DAE  and  the  NGOs  throughout  crop\nproduction  and  marketing,  (iii)  the  requirement  for  detailed\ncontracts between DAE and participating NGOs and the provision\nof a DAE-NGO Coordination Committee in the project design, (iv)\nthe provision of consultants to assist with starting the project and\nformulating the training courses, and (v) the provision for project\nsupervision units for project coordination and supervision at field\nlevel.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n2. The construction of the Jamuna bridge with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance\nin 19981 provided a road link between the northwest region and the rest of the country, ending\nthe physical isolation of one quarter of the country\u2019s population and opening a broad range of\neconomic opportunities. In FY1996, in anticipation of the completion of the bridge, ADB financed\na study to investigate the development potential of the northwest region.2 One of the study\u2019s\nmain recommendations was that agriculture development become one of the major strategies\nfor promoting economic growth and reducing poverty in the northwest region. On this basis, the\nstudy  was  followed  on  in  1999  by  technical  assistance  (TA)3  to  prepare  an  agriculture\ndevelopment project for possible ADB financing. The draft project preparation report for the TA\nwas submitted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Investment Center in April 2000\nand has been followed by a series of consultation and fact-finding missions. These culminated\nin an appraisal mission from 7 to 17 August 2000.4 During these missions the findings of the TA\nwere reviewed in detail with representatives of the government at central and field levels,\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other funding agencies active in agriculture, and the\noriginal proposal was refined into a focused investment project. This report summarizes the\nfindings of the missions and is based on the recommendations of the original investment study;\nthe findings of the participatory rural appraisals; and extensive field visits and discussions with\nthe NGOs and the farmers in the region to understand their needs, priorities, and constraints. A\nlogical framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. The Agriculture Sector\n3. Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a gross domestic product\n(GDP) per capita of approximately $265. The population is approximately 120 million, with over\n800 people per square kilometer, making it also one of the world\u2019s most densely populated\ncountries. Population growth has declined in recent years to just below 2 percent per annum.\nAlthough the urban population is growing rapidly by migration from rural areas, Bangladesh\nremains primarily a rural society with over 80 percent of the population living in the rural areas.\nWith a high population density and a limited land base, poverty, and especially rural poverty, is\na pervasive problem. A recent study sponsored by ADB5 indicates that 51 percent of rural\npeople are poor, whereas only 26 percent of urban people are poor in Bangladesh. The national\npoverty level is 46.5 percent. The study also noted that the overall progress in the reduction of\npoverty was slow in rural areas. Because over 80 percent of the country's poor live in rural\nareas, progress in reducing rural poverty continues to be the key challenge facing the country.\n                  \n1 Loan 1487-BAN: Jamuna Bridge, for $200 million, approved on 8 March 1994.\n2 TA 2545-BAN: Northwest Region Development and Investment Study, for $1.1 million, approved on 21 March\n1996.\n3 TA 3230-BAN: Northwest Agriculture Development, for $500,000, approved on 26 July 1999.\n4 Mission comprised P. Dayal (Mission Leader), E. Araneta (Counsel), Edward Breckner (Agriculture Specialist-\nConsultant), and Dennis Ellingson (Agriculture Economist-Consultant).\n5 Sen, Binayak. February 2000; Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions.", "2\n4. Agriculture dominates the country\u2019s economy and supports the vast majority of the\ncountry\u2019s population, producing 32 percent of GDP and 23 percent of exports, and employing 60\npercent of the labor force. Within the agriculture sector, food crop production accounts for about\n75 percent of the value added. An estimated 9.3 million hectares (ha) are cultivated, with a\ncropping intensity exceeding 150 percent. Rice comprises about 76 percent of the cropped\narea, with other crops including pulses (5 percent); wheat (4 percent); jute (4 percent); oilseeds\n(4 percent); and the remainder (7 percent) producing vegetables, fruits, cotton, sugar, tea, and\nrubber. About 2.93 million ha or 31 percent of the cultivated land is irrigated. This includes large\nsurface irrigation systems (0.20 million ha), shallow tubewells, (1.16 million ha), low lift pumps,\n(0.64 million ha), deep tubewells (0.44 million ha), and traditional methods (0.44 million ha).\n5. Beside crop production, other agriculture-based activities include livestock production,\npond and capture fisheries, and forestry. The impact of these activities can be substantial, with\nlivestock production, for example, accounting for 3 percent of total GDP and 10 percent of\nagricultural GDP, and employment for 20 percent of the rural labor force. Livestock production\nand fisheries are particularly important in filling the income gap left from crop production and\nmay account for up to 50 percent of household incomes.\n6. Based on a rapid increase in irrigation using shallow tubewell technology, combined with\nthe use of high yielding rice varieties in the flood-free winter season, Bangladesh achieved near\nself-sufficiency in food production in the early 1990s, after many years of severe food deficits.\nSince  then,  the  Government  has  emphasized  sustained  growth  of  food  production.  The\nproduction  of  irrigated  winter  rice  crop  has  nearly  doubled  since  the  mid-1980s  and  now\naccounts for 40 percent of the country\u2019s total agriculture production.6 In contrast, the country\u2019s\nmain cash crop, jute has had stagnant and even declining levels of production throughout the\n1990s.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  notable  increase  in  the  production  of  fruit  and\nvegetable crops and of fodder crops for a growing livestock industry.\n1.  The Northwest Region\n7. The northwest region, which corresponds administratively with the Rajshahi division,\ncomprises about one fifth of the country\u2019s land area and supports more than one quarter of the\ncountry\u2019s population (31.7 million). Eighty-six percent of the population is rural, which is the\nhighest proportion in the country and signifies the predominance of agriculture in the region\u2019s\neconomy. Agriculture in the region is characterized by a large number of small holdings (below\n1 ha), traditionally focused on the production of rice. Since almost all available land is currently\nused for cultivation, there is little scope for an increase in the total cropped area. Nonfarm\nemployment opportunities are few and the development of trade, services, and industries has\nbeen sparse. Poverty in the region is pervasive, with 62.2 percent of the population below the\npoverty line, a figure that is substantially higher than the national average. In terms of human\npoverty indicators, Rajshahi division is noted for the lowest level of adult literacy, life expectancy\nat birth, and child immunization rate in the country. Much of this is because, until recently, the\nregion had been cut off from the rest of the country by the Ganges River to the south and the\nJamuna River to the east. This isolation has historically restricted the region\u2019s access to critical\ninputs, markets, and technologies and has resulted in its slow development and high poverty\nlevels.\n8. Despite its current low status of development, the region is well suited to agriculture. It is\ncharacterized by relatively fertile, well-drained soils, ample ground and surface water resources\n                  \n6 ADB has contributed significantly to this growth in food production through program and project loans that have\nhelped to liberalize the sector and promote capital investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure.", "3\n(except in one area known as the Barind Tract), a varied climate that is favorable to a range of\ncrops (allowing the region to produce 50 percent of the country\u2019s wheat), and relatively flat\nterrain. More than 80 percent of the area is classified as medium to high lands, making it one of\nthe least flood prone regions in the country and allowing the production of diversified crops\nthroughout the year. Thus, the region has a significant comparative advantage for growing high\nvalue crops (HVCs),7 as most other regions of the country are flood prone; have less well\ndrained soils; and have a hotter, more humid climate. In particular, potential exists to produce\noff-season fruits and vegetables, which could be marketed at high prices to Dhaka and other\nparts of the country.\n9. The potential for further investment in the northwest region was increased with the\nconstruction of the Jamuna bridge. The construction of this major transport link ended the\nregion\u2019s isolation from the rest of the country, opened access to markets in Dhaka and other\nurban centers, and enhanced access within the region to modern agricultural inputs. Future\ninvestment potential was investigated in detail through the Northwest Region Development and\nInvestment Study, (see footnote 2) approved soon after the bridge construction. The study\nconcluded that \u201cfor economic development of the region to be successful there must be a strong\nagriculture base\u201d. It also highlighted the need for increased rural credit and for such credit to\nreach small-scale farmers who constitute the largest segment of the farming community but are\nnot served by commercial or NGO financing institutions. The study further pointed out the\npotential for new HVCs in the northwest region, due to its favorable agronomic environment and\nnew access to markets in the rest of the country.\n2. Crop  Production,  Diversification,  and  Market  Demand  in  the  Northwest\nRegion\na. Crop Production and Diversification\n10. The northwest region covers a total of 3.45 million ha of which the cultivable area is 2.3\nmillion ha and the cropped area 4.0 million ha (at a cropping intensity of about 175 percent). Of\nthe cultivated area, about 1.4 million ha, or about 60 percent, is irrigated, mostly by shallow\ntubewells installed within the last 10-15 years. The vast majority of the cropped area is planted\nto rice, the main \u201caman\u201d or wet season rice crop accounting for 1.8 million ha, the early or \u201caus\u201d\ncrop accounting for 238,000 ha, and the winter or \u201cboro\u201d crop accounting for 863,000 ha. Boro\nseason production, in particular, is associated with irrigation since it is the dry season. After rice,\nthe next major crop in terms of cropped area is wheat, which covers 366,000 ha and, like boro\nrice, is grown in the winter and depends heavily on irrigation. These two traditional crops (rice\nand wheat) thus take up 82 percent of the cropped area in the region, and, with other traditional\ncrops (jute, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane) make up over 90 percent of the cropped area. The\nbalance is used for HVCs: vegetables (50,000 ha), spices and condiments (39,000 ha), fruit\n(46.000 ha), and root and tuber crops such as potato and taro (60,000 ha).\n11. These HVCs, while accounting for only 5 percent of the total cropped area, give a higher\nreturn per hectare than boro rice and are the most promising crops for diversification. Until very\nrecently the incentive to grow such crops (despite their higher income return per hectare than\nrice) was offset by the farmers\u2019 priority for food security in the semisubsistence rural economy\nprevailing in the region. This situation is now changing rapidly. In the last two decades, rice\n                  \n7 High value crops have been defined as any crop that provides higher net returns per hectare to the farmer than high\nyielding winter rice. These may include hybrid maize; potatoes; vegetables (onion, cabbage, eggplant, tomato\npumpkin, radish); spices (ginger, chilies, turmeric, garlic and coriander; and fruits (bananas, papayas, mangoes\nlychee).", "4\nproduction  in  Bangladesh  and  in  the  northwest  has  increased  dramatically  due  to  the\nwidespread adoption of modern technologies and the use of minor irrigation. In the northwest\nalone, about 1 million ha have been brought into production during the dry season in the past\ntwo decades through the spread of minor irrigation. As a result, the region now produces a large\nrice surplus and supplies almost 3.0 million tons of unhulled rice annually to other parts of the\ncountry.\n12. The move from rice deficit to surplus has been accompanied by a decline in the real\nprice of rice.8  Rice, for many farmers, is now becoming, at least in part, a cash crop to be\ntraded rather than an object of food security to be grown regardless of its comparative financial\nreturn. A further transformation in crop production is therefore now beginning to take place.\nFarmers are starting to diversify to HVCs such as tubers, vegetables, and hybrid maize in place\nof rice as sources of cash income, thereby increasing their household\u2019s and the region\u2019s overall\neconomic productivity. At present this transformation is limited to a few areas, but the area for\nand production of such crops could increase significantly.\nb. Market Demand\n13. Bangladesh is a large net importer of agricultural produce. Recent trade statistics (1997)\nshow  imports  of  HVCs  and  derived  processed  produce  at  about  $50  million.  Substantial\nquantities of HVCs and seeds, including less perishable items such as potatoes and spices,\nenter from neighboring countries into the northwest region and other parts of Bangladesh,\nindicating a significant room for import substitution in the domestic market. The economy has\nexperienced an annual growth rate of 4-5 percent in recent years. According to World Bank\nstudies,9 most HVCs have income elasticities well above those for food grains and higher than\nfor pulses and oils. Based on population and income growth, the countrywide demand for HVCs\nis projected to rise from the current 4.0-5.0 million tons per annum to 5.4-6.5 million tons within\nthe next decade.\n14. Studies during Project preparation indicated that, while the opening of the Dhaka market\nby the Jamuna bridge will provide a marketing stimulus for HVCs outside the region, a major\nunfulfilled demand for many HVCs exists in the project area. Based on current production levels\nand levels of import from bordering countries, the per capita consumption of fruit and vegetables\n(of  about  23.5  kilograms  per  annum)  is  only  about  one  third  of  internationally  accepted\nnutritional  requirements.  The  region  imports  significant  amounts  of  spices  and  condiments\nthrough informal cross border channels, despite growing almost 40,000 ha of these crops.\nDemand projection analysis (based on projected GDP and population growth) has estimated\nthat by 2007 the regional deficit would be 285,000 tons of potato, 400,000 tons of vegetables\nand spices, 96,000 tons of edible oils, 36,000 tons of fruit and 120,000 tons of pulses. The\ndemand for diversified crops in the northwest region will thus continue to exceed supply for\nsome time.\n15. Other factors will influence crop production and marketing in the future. First, the decline\nin rice prices is making the relative farm-level returns to cash crop production more attractive to\nfarmers. Second, the livestock industry is expanding and the demand for manufactured livestock\nfeed is likely to increase substantially, partially contributed by the ADB-financed participatory\nlivestock development project,10 which is operating in the same area. Some NGOs have already\n                  \n8 PPA: BAN 22217: Food Crops Development Program, December 1999.\n9 World Bank. 1995.

Agriculture Support Services\n16. While agriculture inputs in the project area are provided almost entirely by the private\nsector on a commercial basis, most agriculture support services are provided by public sector\nline agencies. These include training and extension support from the Department of Agricultural\nExtension (DAE); research activities by the National Agricultural Research System (NARS);\nmarket  intelligence  and  development  by  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  (DAM);\nmarket infrastructure improvement by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED)\nand agriculture credit by nationalized commercial banks, special agriculture banks and, recently,\nNGOs.\n17. DAE, and particularly its Field Services Wing, is quite a strong agency in the context of\nthe Bangladesh public sector.  It has received considerable support from a variety of external\nagencies, all aimed at providing an efficient, field-oriented crop production extension service. As\na result, a relatively well-trained cadre of about 2,500 field staff supported by 290 specialist\nextension officers and 123 subdistrict agriculture officers are available in the project area.\nMoreover, DAE wants to expand its outreach and capabilities through partnerships with other\nagencies including NGOs. To date, DAE\u2019s main focus has been the promotion of improved\ntechnology in staple crops, principally rice and wheat, which reflects the Government\u2019s priorities.\nOf late, DAE has recruited horticulture specialists at the level of subdistrict officers to further the\npromotion of high value horticulture crops.\n18. Aligned with and supporting DAE\u2019s Field Services Wing is the Food Crops Wing.  The\nFood Crops Wing is specifically mandated to promote horticultural crops and operates 25\nhorticulture  training  and  demonstration  centers,  four  of  which  are  in  the  northwest  region.\nThese centers, developed under the ADB-financed Horticulture Development Project,11 have\nbeen providing training in horticulture production to landless and marginal farmers and technical\nsupport to the staff of the Field Services Wing.\n19. The national agriculture research system in Bangladesh comprises the apex agency, the\nBangladesh Agriculture Research Council, and 10 government-operated research institutes. In\nkeeping with the country's historical priority on food security, much of the funding for agriculture\nresearch has been oriented to traditional staple crops, especially rice, although most research\nagencies have received significant international assistance and support.  Within the system, the\nBangladesh  Agriculture  Research  Institute  (BARI)  is  mandated  to  undertake  research  on\ncereals,  pulses,  tubers,  oilseeds,  vegetables,  fruit,  spices  and  condiments  through  its  15\nresearch divisions, 6 regional agriculture research stations, and 22 agriculture research centers.\nThe responsibility for the crops being specifically targeted by the Project is divided between the\nHorticulture Research Center, the Spice Research Center, and the Tuber Crops Research\nCenter. The Spice Research Center is in the northwest and the other two centers have their\nspecialized research stations in the region.\n20. DAM is responsible for overseeing the development of marketing in the country. Unlike\nDAE and NARS, DAM has received limited budgetary and external support has therefore lacked\nfacilities  and  resources  to  undertake  its  mandated  tasks.  As  a  result,  despite  having  an\nimportant role and professionally qualified staff through to district level, its performance is not\n                  \n11 Loan 1010-BAN: Horticulture Development, for $22.6 million, approved on 21 December 1989.", "6\nrated highly.  With the increasing focus on HVCs, efficient markets and timely market and price\ninformation on a local and interregional basis will increasingly become critical. DAM, which is\nresponsible  for  information  collection  and  dissemination,  engages  it\u2019s  district  staff  for  this\npurpose but the output is largely used for statistical purposes. Still, the DAM staff constitute an\nexisting cadre of personnel who are involved in market research and can be equipped to deliver\ninformation to farmers and traders on current market prices and market prospects on a regional\nand  interregional  basis.  To  do  this,  DAM  will  need  considerable  institutional  strengthening\nthrough  role  redefinition,  staff  training,  basic  communication  and  information  technology,\nequipment, and budgetary support.\n21. The market infrastructure improvement program that has been undertaken by the LGED\nfor general market upgrading, while not oriented specifically to the provision of facilities for\nHVCs, has had a significant impact on improving market infrastructure efficiency through such\nmeasures as paving access roads, improving drainage, providing covered sales and storage\nareas, and providing loading and unloading areas. More than 300 primary rural markets in the\nnorthwest have been upgraded and handed over to local authorities who generally contract\nthem out to private vendors for operation and maintenance.\n.\n22. The northwest region is served by over 900 rural bank branches, including 300 branches\nof  the  Rajshahi  Krishi  Unnayan  Bank  (RAKUB),  a  specialized  agriculture  bank  focused\nexclusively  on  the  northwest  region.  Despite  this,  like  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  only  an\nestimated 10 percent of farm households have access to formal agriculture credit.  The banking\nsystem in the country, except for the foreign banks (which account for 5 percent of the system),\nis fragile, with capital adequacy levels below international norms, high levels of nonperforming\nloans, and low repayment rates. In contrast to the performance of the formal sector, a number of\nNGOs have demonstrated efficient delivery of microcredit in the project area and are beginning\nto enter the agriculture sector. However, the most notable characteristic of the agriculture credit\nsituation in the country and in the northwest is that the bulk of the small-scale farmers have\nbeen missed by both the formal sector (the banks) and the semiformal sector (the NGOs)\nbecause the NGO programs focus on the landless and marginal farmers and the banks require\ncollateral that only the large-scale farmers can provide. As a result, the farmers who have the\npotential to diversify do not have access to agriculture credit to help them to do so.\n4. Nongovernment Organizations in Agriculture\n23. In Bangladesh, about 1,500 NGOs are registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau, of which\nabout 1,000 have microfinance operations. Most of these are small local operations, but data of\n495 microfinance NGOs compiled by the Credit and Development Forum, a network of NGOs,\nindicates (i) a total network of 11 million households,12 (ii) savings mobilization of Tk14 billion\n($247 million), and (iii) loans outstanding of Tk29 billion ($568 million). Conservative estimates\nput the annual disbursement of these NGOs at Tk28 billion ($549 million). NGOs in Bangladesh\nthus play a major role in mobilizing rural finance and promoting development activities.\n24. Despite the large numbers of NGOs in the country, the 10 largest account for 90 percent\nof the membership and microfinance operations and the top 5 for 80 percent. These include the\nGrameen Bank, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), The Association for\nSocial Advancement (ASA), Proshika Manavik Kendra (PROSHIKA), Thengamara Mohila Sabuj\nSangah (TMSS), Rangpur/Dinajpur Rural Services (RDRS), and the Grameen Krishi Foundation\n(GKF). Two of these agencies (RDRS and GKF) focus principally or entirely in the northwest.\n                  \n12At an average of five persons per household, this would cover nearly 50 percent of the country\u2019s population.", "7\nLending operations of these NGOs are funded by (i) members\u2019 savings; (ii) borrowings from\nPalli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), \u2014 NGO apex organization on-lending for poverty\nreduction projects) and from banks, and (iii) internal accruals and foreign agencies.\n25. In contrast to the performance of the agencies in the formal credit sector, the established\nNGOs have exhibited (i) pro-poor and marked gender orientation, 85 percent of members being\npoor women; (ii) products and services consistent with the demand profile of the poor; (iii) an\nemphasis on savings; (iv) repayment rates of well over 90 percent; (v) interest rates on loans\nthat reflect the cost of microfinance delivery (up to 30 percent); (vi) operating surpluses; and (vii)\nmotivated staff. Notwithstanding their impressive achievements, there are concerns regarding\nsustainability,  inadequate  transparency,  and  a  high  dependence  on  donor  funds.  The\nGovernment has agreed to institute a regulatory regime for NGOs providing microfinance; ADB\nis providing support for instituting the regime.13\n26. Some microfinance borrowings from NGOs are used for subsistence agriculture and for\nshort-term cash crops. However, in the past, NGOs have been reluctant to specifically extend\nagriculture  credit  despite  the  fact  that  subsistence  agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the  rural\neconomy. This has been due to (i) their target group being primarily the landless and marginal\nfarming community; (ii) concerns about the politicization of agricultural credit; and (iii) their lack\nof resources, skills, and capacities to take on agricultural lending. Nonetheless, several of the\nlarge  NGOs  are  now  moving  more  and  more  toward  agriculture-based  lending  and  are\nprogressively targeting small-scale farmers, many of whom are classified as poor.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n27. The Government\u2019s fifth five-year development plan (1997-2002), which was released in\nMarch 1998, sets the framework for agriculture and related policies. Other key documents\ninclude the National Agricultural Policy (1999), the New Agricultural Extension Policy (1996),\nand  the  related  DAE  Strategic  Plan  (1999-2002).  With  regard  to  the  agriculture  and  rural\nsectors, the fifth five-year plan emphasizes (i) the alleviation of poverty through accelerated\neconomic  growth;  (ii)  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  of  the  rural  population  through\nmobilization of the rural masses and the resources at their command; (iii) attainment of food\nproduction  beyond  the  self-sufficiency  level  in  the  shortest  possible  time  and  of  higher\nproduction of diversified high-value produce; and (iv) the development of hitherto neglected\nareas  like  the  northwest  region,  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts,  and  coastal  areas.  The\nmodernization  of  agriculture  is  to  be  attained  through  the  provision  of  extension  services,\ntraining, requisite inputs, and credit to farmers. Another major thrust will be increased irrigation\ncoverage,  better  water  management,  and  improved  varieties  of  seeds  for  rice  and  wheat.\nMoreover, the plan envisages a major effort to provide adequate marketing, transport, and\nstorage facilities, and recognizes the increasing dominance and potential contribution of the\nprivate sector and the NGOs in agriculture.\n28. A  National  Agriculture  Policy,  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  April  1999,\nreiterates the need to intensify and diversify agriculture production. It emphasizes the increase\nin rice productivity through timely provision of inputs, a move to HVCs where feasible, and the\nprovision of credit to support both. Of particular note is the expressed intention of setting up an\nagricultural credit foundation (also called the Krishi Rin Foundation) following the PKSF model\nduring the fifth five-year plan. This would act as an apex body for NGOs providing credit for\nagriculture activities as opposed to the direct poverty related NGO activities of PKSF.\n                  \n13TA 3078-BAN: Establishment of the Framework for Sustainable Microfinance, for $800,000, approved on 29\nSeptember 1998.", "8\n29. The New Agricultural Extension Policy emphasizes sustainable technologies, promotion\nof research-extension linkages, and inclusion of NGOs and the private sector in technology\ntransfer to farmers. The policy envisages a major role for DAE in all aspects of extension but\nrecognizes  the  need  for  developing  partnerships  with  NGOs,  other  government  extension\nproviders, the private sector, and education providers for both extension and research-extension\ncollaboration. It proposes the use of multiple extension approaches to facilitate rapid technology\ntransfer, recognizes the potential of public mass media, and recommends strengthening the\nagriculture information system. Within DAE\u2019s Strategic Plan 2000, extension approaches are\nbased on decentralization, responsiveness to farmers\u2019 needs, working with groups, and the use\nof a range of extension methods and partners.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n30. External assistance to the agriculture sector continues to be provided by ADB, the World\nBank, United Nations (UN) agencies, and bilateral agencies. Over the past decade or so, ADB's\nfocus  has  been  on  enabling  the  effective  functioning  of  the  sector,  initially  through  the\nFoodcrops  Development  Program  (FDP):14  and  subsequently  through  a  series  of  rural\ninfrastructure, water resource improvement, and microfinance projects. The rural infrastructure\nprojects  focused  on  the  provision  of  feeder  roads  and  markets,  the  water  resource\nimprovement, projects focused on the provision of irrigation as a critical crop input, and the\nmicrofinance projects aimed at supplying critically needed financial resources to the rural poor.\nIn crop diversification, the Horticulture Development Project was implemented to build know-\nhow and capacities in service providers and homestead horticultural producers. The Project was\nsuccessfully completed in 1999 having trained over 70,000 farmers in horticulture techniques\nand developed 25 horticulture training and demonstration centers (of which four are located in\nthe northwest). Relatedly, the ongoing Participatory Livestock Development Project (PLDP)\naims at broadening the rural income base by supporting small and marginal farmers and women\nin subsistence livestock production.\n31. The World Bank has provided major support to the sector through its Agriculture Support\nServices Project (ASSP), which provided a major contribution to reorienting the focus of the\npublic extension system and formulating the New Agricultural Extension Policy. This is being\nfollowed up under the Agriculture Services Innovation and Reform Project (ASIRP), a learning\nand innovation loan, which is being cofinanced by the Department for International Development\n(DFID) and FAO and assisting in the implementation of the new extension policy. The World\nBank has also been active in developing the national agriculture research system through a\nseries of agriculture research management projects.\n32. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has completed the first\nphase of support for an Agriculture Technology Development Project, in which it has supported\nagribusiness development through training and credit. A second phase of this project has been\napproved recently, and will commence in early 2001.\n33. Support from bilateral agencies has been on either an individual basis or in collaboration\nwith multilateral banks. DFID, for example has been particularly active in supporting the ASSP\nand the ASIRP. The Government of Denmark has recently announced a Dkr486 million program\nof agricultural development over five years, which includes crops, aquaculture, and livestock.\nThe Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has been active in promoting crop\ndiversification and some success has been achieved with potato. The experience highlighted\n                  \n14 Loan 1045-BAN: Foodcrops Development Program, for $125 million, on 6 November 1990.", "9\nthe need to link cropping decisions to marketing opportunities, CIDA has recently approved a\nfollow-on  project,  the  Farm  to  Market  Enterprise  Development  Project.  Details  on  external\nassistance to the agriculture and rural development sector are given in Appendix 2.\nD. Lessons Learned\n34. A  1997  study  of  postevaluated  projects  in  Bangladesh15  and  lessons  learned  from\nseveral  ADB-financed  agriculture  projects  highlight  the  importance  of  (i)  institutional\nstrengthening to ensure institutional capacity and competence of executing agencies, and of\nregional  and  district  entities  and  beneficiary  groups;  (ii)  the  need  to  ensure  beneficiary\nparticipation as early as possible, in the design and implementation of the project, and in post-\nproject operation and maintenance (O&M); (iii) the need for effective sector analysis and project\npreparation prior to appraisal; (iv) the need for a flexible project implementation system based\non a process-oriented approach; and (v) the need to locate the project management team in the\nproject area, with mechanisms for regular contact with beneficiaries.\n35. In terms of lessons to be learned from specific Projects, the most relevant project is the\nPLDP. This project is similar in design to the proposed Project, covers the same project area,\nand uses the same NGOs. The latest review of the PLDP indicates that implementation is\nproceeding smoothly, with the NGOs fulfilling their mandate and performing well within target\nand levels of beneficiary organization, training, and credit provision. The Government-managed\ncomponents are also proceeding smoothly. The Horticulture Development Project, implemented\nby DAE (the executing agency for the proposed Project), was successfully implemented and\ncompleted in 1999 although implementation took several years longer than originally planned.\nDelays  were  due  to  start-up  problems  and  difficulties  identifying  and  purchasing  large\ncontiguous blocks of land for research stations and horticulture training and demonstration\ncenters development training centers. In terms of training in horticulture, the Project surpassed\nits target, training over 70,000 landless and marginal farmer beneficiaries as opposed to an\nappraisal target of 60,000.\n36. Postevaluation studies revealed that people living within the influence of the improved\ninfrastructure obtained access to agricultural inputs at reduced prices, increased their use of\nhigh-yielding varieties, enhanced their agriculture production, and had better access to health\nand education facilities than prior to the project. Small-scale industries and trade activities also\nincreased. The Third Rural Infrastructure Project16 is currently being successfully implemented\nand a project preparatory TA for a fourth such project is programmed in the Bangladesh country\nassistance plan 2001.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n37. Consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  and  ADB\u2019s  medium-term\nstrategic  framework,  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  Bangladesh  identified\npoverty reduction as its overarching objective.17 This will be achieved by targeting four priority\nareas  (promoting  faster  private  sector-led  economic  growth,  creating  better  development\nopportunities  for  the  poor  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  improving  human  development,  and\nprotecting the environment) in 15 subsectors. In the agriculture and rural sectors, the COS\nsupports  the  move  away  from  an  integrated  rural  development  approach  and  advocates\nsimplicity of implementation. The operational focus in the agriculture and rural sectors will be\n                  \n15Country Synthesis of Post-Evaluation Findings in Bangladesh, OEO, 1997.\n16 Loan 1581-BAN: Third Rural Infrastructure Project, for $70 million, approved on 20 November, 1997.\n17ADB. August 1999. Bangladesh Country Operational Strategy: Responding to the Challenge of Poverty.", "10\nplaced on the crop, agrobusiness, and microfinance subsectors because the major constraints\ninhibiting agricultural growth identified in the COS lie in these subsectors. These constraints\ninclude weak rural development and extension support, lack of high quality planting materials,\nlarge unexploited irrigation potential and its suboptimal utilization, lack of effective rural financial\nservices  for  a  majority  of  small  and  marginal  farmers,  lack  of  marketing  channels,  and\npostharvest losses. The strategy in these subsectors is to enhance the capacity of the private\nsector and NGOs to provide microcredit, extension, and marketing support to the poor for\nincreasing  crop  intensification  and  diversification,  and  agrobusiness.  The  strategy  also\nemphasized  the  role  of  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  in  providing  microcredit  and  rural\ninfrastructure to enhance rural nonfarm growth in order to meet the financing requirements of\nsmall and medium enterprises.\n38. The  poverty  reduction  objective  and  strategy  were  amplified  in  a  poverty  reduction\npartnership agreement recently signed between ADB and the Government.18 The agreement\naimed at achieving both income and nonincome aspects of poverty reduction in the medium\nterm through pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. An area approach is\nto be adopted to target assistance to areas of high poverty concentration. The strategy identified\nmeasures  to  enable  agricultural  growth  through  diversification  into  HVCs  and  noncrop\nagriculture,  research  and  extension,  improvement  of  small  and  medium  irrigation  systems,\nmicrofinance, storage and marketing, rural infrastructure, community development, and market\nliberalization by supporting the Government in hastening reforms to create an environment\nconducive for greater private sector and NGO participation in rural areas.\n39. The Project is consistent with the COS and the poverty reduction partnership agreement\nin that it aims at increasing agricultural growth to sustain higher income and poverty reduction of\nsmall-scale farmers through improving the entire cycle of diversification to HVCs (including\ntraining and extension, microcredit provision, adaptive research, and marketing support) with\nsignificant participation by NGOs and the private sector. Moreover, the Project will adopt an\narea approach by targeting the northwest region, which is the poorest area in the country.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n40. In close coordination with the World Bank and other agencies, ADB has been actively\ninvolved with the Government in agriculture sector policy dialogue for more than a decade. The\npresent Project\u2019s components cut across three subsectors in which ADB has promoted policy\nformulation and reform: microfinance, rural infrastructure, and agriculture input supply.\n1. Microfinance Policies\n41. The main concerns in microfinance include (i) ensuring sustainability and accountability\nof microfinance institutions, many of which are NGOs that depend on various funding sources\n(grants, loans, and beneficiary savings) and are not under any real regulatory supervision or\ncontrol; and (ii) the need for microfinance institutions to better serve farmers in addition to rural\noff-farm activities, welfare, and subsistence needs. ADB is closely involved in microfinance\nthrough its recently-approved Rural Livelihood Project.19 In addition, ADB is providing TA to help\nformulate  and  establish  a  sustainable  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  microfinance\n                  \n18Based on TA 3339-BAN: Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government of\nBangladesh, for $95,000, approved on 14 December 1999.\n19 Loan 1634-BAN: Rural Livelihood, for $42.6 million, approved on 29 September 1998.", "11\noperations.20 In relation to agriculture, most NGOs have focused primarily on off-farm activities\nfor the rural landless and marginal farmers. The Government now recognizes the need to\nincrease the access of small-scale farmers to crop finance and to encourage NGOs to provide\nsuch services. It has thus proposed the establishment of an apex organization, the Krishi Rin\nFoundation (KRF) for agriculture financing to NGOs, to assist in their transition, to build their\ncapacities, and to supervise their operations on the lines of PKSF. KRF will be supported in the\ninitial  stages  with  financing  from  the  World  Bank  and  will  be  closely  monitored  by  ADB.\nProvision has been made to incorporate KRF as a financing channel for crop credit under the\nProject, after it has been evaluated and proven viable and effective.\n2. Rural Infrastructure Policies\n42. ADB has also been active in policy dialogue related to rural infrastructure. The major\nissues relate to the need for functioning O&M systems and the need to ensure local participation\nin the selection and management of rural infrastructure. Directly as a result of policy dialogue\nwith  ADB,  the  Government  now  budgets  over  Tk1  billion  ($20  million)  annually  for  rural\ninfrastructure maintenance. However, markets, which are of particular concern to the Project,\ncontinue to have deficient O&M. Detailed discussions on this issue during project preparation\nled the Government to agree to implement, with the Project\u2019s assistance, a variety of new O&M\nsystems to provide for greater local stakeholder participation and commitment for maintenance.\nThese could include revisions to market leases to make their terms longer than the current\nstandard  of  one  year,  a  division  of  lease  contracts  into  management  and  maintenance\nresponsibilities, and revision of the current practice of retaining the maximum of 25 percent of\nmarket incomes for maintenance. These will be implemented first in the markets to be improved\nunder the Project and will thereafter be replicated in the rest of the country.\n3. Agricultural Input Policies\n43. The ADB\u2019s major policy involvement in the agriculture inputs subsector has most notably\nbeen through the FDP, which promoted growth in food crop production through the removal of\nmarket restrictions on minor irrigation equipment, fertilizer, and seed. The Project Performance\nAudit Report (PPAR) rated the program partly successful;21 but, from the point of view of\nagriculture production, acknowledged significant increases in the production of staple rice and\nwheat crops.\n44. One of the FDP\u2019s major achievements that has led to this growth was the removal of all\nrestrictions  on  marketing  of  minor  irrigation  equipment.  Another  was  the  removal  of  the\nBangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) from any involvement in fertilizer\nmarketing and the freeing of fertilizer marketing for private sector operations. In addition, at the\ntime of the second tranche release, all fertilizer subsidies had been removed including those on\ndomestically-produced urea; and, when the second tranche was released, the Government was\nmoving to close all of BADC\u2019s retail seed outlets. Subsequently, however, subsidy on urea was\nreinstated and some retail seed outlets were continued.\n                  \n20TA 3078-BAN: Establishment of the Framework for Sustainable Microfinance, for $800,000, approved on 29\nSeptember 1998.\n21 The FDP was completed in June 1995, two years behind schedule, and ADB persistence was required to ensure\nsatisfactory compliance with Program measures prior to release of the second tranche in May 1994. The principal\nconcerns noted in the Project Performance Audit included the mixed performance of some policy measures; the\nfailure to achieve full food self-sufficiency; and questions about the sustainability of reforms, primarily in the\nfertilizer market.", "12\n45. Two unresolved issues are relevant to the present Project. First, despite the end of\nBADC\u2019s role, there are continuing distortions in the marketing and pricing of urea, with the\nprincipal concern being the economic subsidy that has grown as a result of rising world prices.\nSecond, and of much lesser importance, BADC is still involved on a limited scale in retail\nmarketing of seed, despite having committed to terminate this under the FDPL.22 These issues\nare subjects of continuing policy dialogue in close coordination with the World Bank which is\npresently processing an agriculture sector program loan. The policy issues discussed by the\nMission and proposed actions are given in Appendix 3.\n46. In regard to urea, the paramount objective of the Government is to ensure a secure\nsupply at stable prices throughout the country. Therefore in 1994-1995, when a severe urea\nshortage occurred in the country, the Government responded by appointing fertilizer dealerships\non the basis of specific geographic areas. Since then, no urea shortage had been reported. The\nGovernment  maintains  that  a  limited  public  sector  intervention  in  the  production  and  or\nmarketing of strategic agriculture inputs is critical to sustain the productivity of the country\u2019s\nagriculture sector. It is clear that given the economic and political importance of urea, resolution\nof the subsidy issue will require continued dialogue and strong empirical evidence to support it.\nThe policy dialogue under the Project, therefore focused on controls imposed on urea marketing\nand the resultant inefficiencies. The Government agreed to reexamine the whole question of\nfertilizer dealerships and consider any changes, required to improve the efficiency of fertilizer\nsupply to farmers. To this end, the Government will have an independent and comprehensive\nassessment of the fertilizer distribution system completed by 30 June 2001 and will inform ADB\nof the outcome and actions planned to be taken.\n47. In regard to seed, the Government\u2019s view is that a retail marketing role for BADC is\njustified to ensure a secure seed supply in areas of the country that are unlikely to be served by\nthe private sector. However, during the Project\u2019s preparation, the Government agreed to review\nthis role in light of the construction of the Jamuna bridge which has alleviated the isolation of the\nproject area. The Government has agreed to (i) complete a full review of the BADC retail seed\noutlets by 30 June 2001, and inform the ADB of the outcome and a timetable for further action;\nand to also (ii) review the mechanism for seed import, testing, and approval in order to identify\ninefficiencies and suggest streamlined procedures that will encourage greater private sector\nparticipation and improve the flow of new seed varieties into the country by 31 December 2001.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n48. The northwest is one of the Bangladesh's poorest and most backward regions despite its\nfavorable natural resources. It has traditionally been at a disadvantage compared to other parts\nof the country due to its physical isolation, which has been partly alleviated by the Jamuna\nbridge and additional infrastructure investments under way to improve road links from the bridge\nto Dhaka and into the heartland of the northwest.23 These developments have presented new\nopportunities for increasing agriculture production and the incomes of much of the population of\nthe  region.  Moreover,  the  area  has  good  potential  for  agriculture  (para.  8)  and  scope  for\ndiversification  away  from  traditional  crops.  Although  there  is  little  scope  for  expansion  or\nintensification of traditional crops, farmers could increase their incomes by raising crops, that\n                  \n22At present, BADC accounts for less than 7 percent of the domestic seed trade. Moreover, with the exception of\npotato, full private sector participation is expected in all areas of seed imports and marketing for the crops to be\npromoted under the Project.\n23Loan1478-BAN: Jamuna Bridge Access Roads, for $72 million, approved on 5 November 1996.", "13\ncan provide a greater value per unit area than can high yielding varieties of rice. There is ample\nscope to do this without affecting the region\u2019s or the households\u2019 food security.\n49. In addition to the physical isolation, other factors have limited agriculture development in\nthe past, constrained diversification away from traditional crops to HVCs, and thus kept incomes\nin the region low and stagnant. These include lack of knowledge of appropriate crops and\nvarieties on the part of the farmers; a dearth of information on markets and market potentials for\nnontraditional crops; most importantly, difficulties in accessing production credit, especially for\nsmall-scale farmers, to experiment with new crops and technologies; inadequate focus of public\nresearch and extension on crops other than rice; and limited participation of NGOs and the\nprivate sector in agriculture support services.\n 50. The Project was thus designed to break the low income cycle by focusing on HVC\nproduction and addressing many of the identified constraints. In this way, the Project will be able\nto reach a large number of small-scale farmers (men and women), provide them with the\ninformation and knowledge needed to diversify to new HVCs, provide them with the financial\nresources to purchase inputs and equipment, and assist them in marketing their produce at\nbetter prices. This will have an overall beneficial impact on the participating farmers and the\nregion's economy as a whole; on the labor market, due to increased labor demand; and on\noverall regional nutrition as new and more nutritious vegetables and fruits become available at\naccessible prices.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n51. The Project is aimed at diversifying crops in the northwest region to increase regional\nand  farm  incomes  and  thereby  alleviate  poverty.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  promote\nproduction and more efficient marketing of HVCs and to build sustainable partnerships and\ncapacities of NGOs and the public sector agencies in order to provide extension, training, and\ncredit support to the small-scale farmers. Poverty reduction objectives will be achieved through\ndirect improvement in incomes for project participants and increased employment opportunities\nfor nonparticipants, brought about by additional farm labor requirements and increased demand\nfor transportation and processing.\n52. The  Project  has  been  designed  base  on  extensive  consultations  with  the  farming\ncommunity, NGOs, and agriculture service providers. It takes into account a holistic assessment\nof the farming systems in the project area that includes issues such as labor availability, risk-\naverse behavior of smallholders, and social and gender considerations. The Project will cover\nall 16 districts of the northwest region, but will be limited to the 60 subdistricts (out of 127)\nhaving the highest potential for diversification to HVCs. The list of agreed subdistricts is a\nsupplementary appendix (available on request) to this report.\n53. The target group of this project is the small-scale farmers,24 both men and women. Out\nof 3.2 million farm households in the northwest, 1.9 million are smallholders and they constitute\nthe largest segment of the farming community. About half of these small-scale farmers are\npoor25 and the rest are highly susceptible to downward social mobility.26 This group has been\ntraditionally overlooked by government and NGO agriculture service providers. Their access to\nproduction credit has been sparse as NGOs have focused on the landless and the nonfarm\nsector and the formal sector has neglected them because of inadequate collateral. Yet, this\n                  \n24 Farmers with landholdings of 0.2-1.2 ha.\n25 World Bank. 1998. (Bangladesh: Counting the Poor and Making the Poor Count), notes that up to 70 percent of\nsmall farmers and 32 percent of medium-scale farmers are poor.\n26 Hossain Zillur Rehman, 1995. Crisis and Insecurity, the other Face of Poverty.", "14\ngroup has the land resources to try out new crops and cropping patterns and has demonstrated\ninitiative in the project area to diversify cropping. The Project will support this process and focus\non the small-scale farmers to promote HVC production, and will encourage women farmers to\nactively participate in the Project.\n54. The  Project  will  have  six  components:  (i)  farmer  training  and  extension,  (ii)  farmer\nmobilization  and  credit  support,  (iii)  adaptive  research,  (iv)  marketing  support,  (v)  pilot\nagribusiness credit line for post-harvest activities, and (vi) support for project management.\n1. Farmer Training and Extension\n55. The Project will finance training in HVC production and marketing through a three tier\ntraining process: (i) technical training for personnel of DAE and interested participating NGOs,\n(ii) institutional training for farmers interested in HVC production, and (iii) village-based training\nfor farmer participants unable to attend institutional courses. Staff training and institutional\nfarmer training will be provided at the four existing horticulture training and demonstration\ncenters (HTDCs) constructed under ADB\u2019s Horticulture Development Project and other training\nfacilities identified in the region, including those operated by NGOs. The training facilities will be\nupgraded  as  necessary.  The  Project  will  finance  the  expansion  of  training  centers  where\nnecessary, and the development of (i) training programs for farmers and for staff responsible for\ntraining  and  extension,  (ii)  comprehensive  visual  technology  packages  for  HVCs  to  be\ndisseminated through village-based extension, and (iii) extension support from DAE and NGOs.\n56. About 200,000 farmers will participate in training programs over the project period,\nthrough institutional and village-based training programs. Since the objective is to demonstrate\nnew cropping opportunities in the project area and equip the identified farming community to\nimplement it, the Project will finance the full costs of farmer training in the first three years of the\ntraining program. Options to sustain the training and extension support beyond the project life\nwill be assessed and finalized during the midterm review. These could include contracting or\nleasing out of all or some training facilities to interested NGOs and the private sector or charging\nof trainees, including NGO staff and farmer participants.\n57. The training courses will be aimed at small-scale farmers and thus will focus on HVCs to\nbe identified by the DAE and NGOs. The HVCs could include field crops such as potato, hybrid\nmaize, legumes, and spices; fruit such as bananas and papayas; and vegetable.\n2. Farmer Mobilization and Credit Support\n58. Four major NGOs with extensive experience in farmer mobilization, experience in the\nnorthwest,  and  (in  some  cases)  experience  in  HVCs  have  indicated  their  willingness  to\nparticipate in the Project in partnership with DAE. These are BRAC, GKF, PROSHIKA, and\nRDRS (Appendix 4). These NGOs all have large memberships, handle large volumes of credit\nannually, and have sound and trustworthy management. BRAC, for example, has over 3.3\nmillion members and handled a credit program of Tk7.1 billion ($140 million) in 1998. Similarly,\nPROSHIKA has 1.4 million members and disbursed Tk2.8 billion ($54 million) in 1998. Both are\nalready engaged in contracted seed production and HVC programs with farmers. GKF and\nRDRS are smaller, but both have extensive experience in the northwest and have been working\non promoting agriculture.\n59. DAE and NGOs will be jointly responsible for publicizing the Project among small-scale\nfarmers  and  identifying  potential  participants  through  participatory  assessments  and  self", "15\nselection by qualifying interested farmers. The NGOs will facilitate the formation of farmer\ngroups for training and credit. About $16 million27 of credit will be coursed through the NGOs\nduring the project period to finance the short-term credit requirements of the project participants.\nCredit demand has been estimated on the basis that, on the average, each participating farmer\nwill grow 0.25 ha of HVCs. About 160,000 trained farmers are likely to opt for the credit\npackages.28  Given  the  NGOs\u2019  current  levels  of  lending  and  farmer  mobilization  this  is\nconsidered to be well within their capabilities.\n60. Since each NGO has its own means of mobilizing farmers and providing credit, the\nProject will not prescribe any change in their practices and procedures other than to focus\nproject activities on the identified HVCs and on the small-scale farmer target groups.\n3. Adaptive Research\n61. For many of the HVCs to be promoted by the Project, available technologies will allow\nmuch higher yields to be achieved than with traditional varieties and traditional techniques.\nHowever, data on such technologies need to be consolidated and some of technologies need to\nbe tested and adapted to conditions prevailing in the northwest. To support the field extension\nand training program, improve access to better technologies, and ensure the supply of high\nquality planting materials for a wide variety of HVCs, the Project will support adaptive research\nby various research agencies (Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute [BARI], universities,\nthe private sector, NGOs) throughout the northwest.\n62. Activities to be financed under the adaptive research program will be (i) the preparation\nof an electronic data bank on HVC varieties and technologies through the identification and\ncompilation of existing research results in Bangladesh research institutions and the identification\nand  procurement  of  relevant  existing  technologies  and  HVC  varieties  from  international\nresearch centers;29  (ii) the provision of some funding to horticulture research facilities in the\nregion; and (iii) adaptive research carried out on a contract basis by suitable research agencies.\nThe topics for adaptive research contracts will be based on proposals received from the field\nextension workers. Mechanisms for research-extension collaboration and farmer participation in\nfarm trials and demonstrations will be detailed in the contracts to be awarded by the project\nmanagement unit (PMU).\n4. Marketing Support\n63. A  key  aspect  of  the  promotion  of  HVC  production  will  be  assistance  for  improved\nmarketing. While a market for high value produce already exists in the region, support is needed\nto provide farmers with up-to-date price information so they can maximize their returns and\nincrease output with better quality standards. Marketing support will have two elements: (i)\nstrengthening DAM to allow it to collect, collate, and disseminate accurate, dependable and\ntimely information on the prices and demand for HVCs; and (ii) renovating and upgrading\nprimary village markets and providing model growers' markets in areas producing large volumes\nof HVCs.\n64. Support will be provided to DAM (in the form of consultancies and training) to assist it (i)\nto develop a market information strategy and train its staff to implement the strategy, (ii) in\ndeveloping market information and broadcast modules, and (iii) in financing market broadcasts\n                  \n27 Base cost.\n28 On project completion, this will result in at least 40,000 ha of incremental cultivation of HVCs.\n29 Such as: Asian Vegetable Research Development Centre (AVRDC), International Centre for Research in Semi-Arid\nTropics (ICRISAT), and International Centre for Potato (CIP).", "16\nduring the project period. A strengthened DAM will disseminate market information to a wide\naudience throughout the region through regular market radio broadcasts, providing current\nmarket prices and trading volumes.\n65. Sixty primary village markets will be renovated and upgraded in subdistricts producing\nlarge volumes of HVCs and where the Project is active. In addition, 16 large growers' markets30\nwill be constructed throughout the region consisting of one market per district, each in an area\nof existing or potential HVC production. Markets will be provided with loading and unloading\nareas, covered areas for produce display and storage, a fresh water supply, and sanitation and\nwaste disposal facilities. To promote efficient operation of the upgraded market facilities, the\nProject  will  finance  a  market  management  study  and  implement  more  efficient  market\nmanagement  systems.  This  subcomponent  will  assess  other  market  management  systems\noperating in the neighboring countries especially for HVCs, formulate adaptable models, and\nassist in their implementation and evaluation.\n5. Pilot Agribusiness Credit Line\n66. The production of increased levels of HVCs under the Project is likely to increase\nrequirements for postharvest storage, processing, and transport enterprises. At the same time,\nan expansion of such enterprises in the project area will act as a stimulus to farmers diversifying\nto HVCs by expanding the size and nature of the markets available to them. Additional cold\nstorage, feed mills, and vegetable and fruit processing plants, for example, could allow farmers\nto grow larger volumes of high value produce and to choose a broader range of crops.\n67. One  impediment  to  the  establishment  of  agribusiness  enterprises  has  been  limited\naccess to credit, especially for private and individual entrepreneurs interested in medium-sized\nventures.  ADB  is  considering  an  agribusiness  development  project  preparatory  TA,\nprogrammed for 2003. This major thrust to support medium-sized agribusiness could help\nalleviate many of the constraints being faced by medium-sized entrepreneurs and provide\ntechnical  and  institutional  support  for  the  new  entrants.  In  this  context,  at  the  request  of\nGovernment, a pilot credit line has been included in the Project to test the feasibility and viability\nof some representative enterprises and the implementation and institutional arrangements for\nagribusiness lending. This component will also help stimulate the market for agricultural produce\nwithin the project area and provide guidance in designing the forthcoming agribusiness loan.\n68. The  credit  line  of  about  $1.0  million  will  be  on-lent  through  RAKUB,  a  bank  that\nspecializes in agriculture exclusively in the northwest region. This pilot activity will focus on the\nestablishment  of  downstream  agribusinesses  in  the  region  in  order  to  support  the  HVC\nproduction under the Project. Activities to be supported will include cold storage, feed mills,\npacking and packaging enterprises, seed processing and storage, and specialized transport for\nHVCs. The technology for all of these enterprises is available in the country.\n6. Project Management Support\n69. A project management unit (PMU) will be established within DAE to supervise overall\nProject implementation and monitoring. The PMU will be supported with necessary equipment,\ntransport, and a team of national and international consultants to guide and support project\nactivities. Two regional project coordination and supervision units will be established, one at\nRajshahi and one at Rangpur. The units will oversee operations in the field and interact with\nbeneficiaries. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established in each implementing\nagency and operational support will be provided to them through the Project.\n                  \n30  Wholesale markets where traders purchase HVCs in high volumes from farmers and traders.", "17\nC. Cost Estimates\n70. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $66.2 million equivalent including about $2.2\nmillion for taxes and duties. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $19.5 million, or about 29\npercent of the total, including $1.3 million for interest during construction on the ADB loan. Local\ncurrency costs are estimated at $46.7 million equivalent, or about 71 percent of the project total.\nCost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 5.\nTable 1:  Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n71. The proposed financing plan is shown in Table 2. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan\nof $46.3 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance 70 percent of the total\ncost of the Project. The loan will finance $19.5 million equivalent of the foreign exchange costs\nand $26.8 equivalent in local currency costs. The remaining project costs, amounting to $19.9\nmillion, will be met by other sources including the Government ($9.6 million) and beneficiaries\n($10.3 million). The loan will have a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8\nyears, and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and\n1.5 percent thereafter. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. The foreign\nexchange risk for the loan proceeds will be borne by the Borrower.\n72. The Project has a high local cost component because it aims at developing the poorest\nregion of Bangladesh by enhancing the region's capacity to produce and market HVCs. Thus, a\nlarge portion of investment is needed to improve research and extension programs, farmers'\ntraining, microfinance, and marketing facilities; all of which require local cost items. Given the\ncountry's weak financial position with overall lack of domestic budgetary resources in the sector,\nmuch of the local cost of the Project must be financed externally to avoid increasing pressure on\nthe Government budget. As such, ADB assistance for local cost financing for this Project is\nconsidered justified.", "18\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 19.5 26.8 46.3 70\nGovernment 0.0 9.6 9.6 14\nBeneficiaries 0.0 10.3a 10.3 16\n     Total 19.5 46.7 66.2 (100)\na Consisting of farmer and paid labor.\nSource: Mission estimates.\nE. Executing Agencies\n1. The Department of Agricultural Extension\n73. DAE of the Ministry of Agriculture will be the principal Executing Agency. DAE has\nconsiderable  experience  in  execution  of  similar  Projects,  including  the  ADB-financed\nHorticulture Development Project and the Command Area Development Project. DAE has also\nhad  a  major  role  in  the  seminal  Agriculture  Support  Services  Project  and  the  Agriculture\nServices Innovation and Reform Project. Both projects were financed by DFID and the World\nBank,  and  have  been  instrumental  in  bringing  about  a  major  reform  of  the  provision  of\nagriculture support services in the country. DAE is currently managing 35 projects, of which 13\ninvolve bilateral or multilateral funding. The agency is essentially a field organization with most\nof its staff consisting of 10,500 extension block supervisors stationed in the 468 subdistricts of\nthe country, supported by 5 specialist officers in each subdistrict. DAE also manages the\nHTDCs provided under the Horticulture Development Project. While previously somewhat wary\nof NGOs and the private sector, DAE\u2019s new strategic plan recognizes its limitations as a\nGovernment agency and envisages close cooperation with NGOs and the private sector in\nextension activities. This is already being put into practice, particularly with NGOs involved in\nagriculture.\n2. Bangladesh Bank\n74. Bangladesh Bank will be the second executing agency and will manage the funds for the\ncredit components of the Project. Bangladesh Bank serves as the country's central bank, and\nthus is ultimately responsible for credit refinancing and supervision of the country's financial\ninstitutions. The apex channeling agency for NGOs (PKSF) did not wish to extend its scope to\ninclude agriculture and the small farmer category. The new apex NGO agency for agriculture,\nthe Krishi Rin Foundation (KRF) is not yet established, the financial status of the banking\ninstitutions in the country was considered unsatisfactory, and the financial intermediation by the\nNGOs in the Project is an innovation that will need to be monitored. This arrangement was also\nconsidered appropriate because it will allow for a change in the on-lending agency, if necessary\nor  desirable  during  project  implementation.31  The  Agriculture  Credit  Project  Department  of\nBangladesh Bank is familiar with the requirements of implementing externally-assisted projects\nand has been involved in several ADB-financed Projects, including (i) the Northwest Rural\n                  \n31This would accommodate, for example, the use of the proposed NGO agriculture financing apex organization, the\nKrishi Rin Foundation, as an implementing agency during the latter part of the Project.", "19\nDevelopment  Project,32  (ii)  the  Second  Aquaculture  Development  Project33  and  (iii)  the\nNortheast Minor Irrigation Project.34\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Management\n75. The  proposed  project  management  structure  is  given  in  Appendix  6.  The  principal\nExecuting Agency for the project, DAE, will be assisted in project implementation by two other\nImplementing Agencies: DAM, and the LGED of the Ministry of Rural Development and Local\nGovernment. In addition, several NGOs will have a central role in the Project as part of a public-\nprivate partnership with the DAE. The four participating NGOs: (BRAC, GKF, PROSHIKA, and\nRDRS) will be responsible for providing credit packages to project beneficiaries and will work\nwith  DAE  in  the  mobilization,  training,  and  provision  of  post-training  extension  support  to\nparticipating farmers. As the principal executing agency, DAE will be responsible for overall\nproject management and execution. It will be specifically responsible for implementing the\nextension  and  training  component  through  its  Food  Crops  and  Field  Services  wings,  in\npartnership with the participating NGOs. DAE will also be responsible for implementing the\nadaptive research component. DAM will implement the market information and the market\nmanagement subcomponents, while LGED will implement the provision of market infrastructure\n(primary and grower markets), working in conjunction with DAE, DAM, and the relevant local\nlevel authority (district, subdistrict, municipality, or groups of villages as the case may be).\n76. Bangladesh Bank will be responsible for relending, supervision, and monitoring of the\ncredit funds to participating NGOs; the pilot agribusiness credit line; and management of the\nrevolving  funds  for  credit  repayments  from  the  NGOs  and  the  agricultural  entrepreneurs.\nBangladesh Bank will be assisted by RAKUB to channel funds to the NGOs and administer the\npilot credit line. A channel was necessary because the Bangladesh Bank\u2019s charter does not\nallow it to directly on-lend funds to NGOs. RAKUB is a suitable agency for this task since it is,\nby mandate and charters an agriculture development bank focusing on the northwest region.\nFurther  or  alternative  channeling  agencies  may  be  selected  by  agreement  between  the\nGovernment and ADB if considered necessary or desirable during project implementation.\n2. Interagency Coordination\n77. Overall coordination among agencies will be achieved through a project coordination\nand steering committee chaired by a secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and consisting of all\nagencies involved in the Project plus the Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance,\nthe Planning Commission, the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry\nof Planning and a representative of the Divisional Commissioner of Rajshahi Division. This\ncommittee will meet at least twice a year to discuss the progress of project implementation,\nresolve  issues  of  interagency  coordination,  and  provide  overall  guidance  to  project\nmanagement.\n78. To provide smooth operation of the farmer mobilization, training, and credit component a\nDAE-NGO coordination committee will be established. This committee will be chaired by the\nhead of the PMU and will consist of representatives from the DAE PIU, each participating NGO,\n                  \n32 Loan 615-BAN: Northwest Rural Development Project, for $45.0 million, approved on 14 November 1982.\n33 Loan 821-BAN: Second Aquaculture Development Project for $45.46 million, approved on 16 December 1986.\n34 Loan 1125-BAN: Northeast Minor Irrigation, for $73.0 million, approved on 21 November 1991.", "20\nand  RAKUB.  The  terms  of  operation  for  this  committee  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  in\ncooperation with the participating NGOs, within six months of loan effectiveness.\n79. An interagency coordinating body is necessary to ensure that all involved agencies, the\nPMU,  DAM,  LGED,  and  local  authorities  participate  fully  in  the  planning,  execution,  and\noperation of the marketing component. Market committees will thus be set up for this purpose in\neach subregion covered by a regional project supervision unit (PSU). These committees will be\nchaired by the regional head of PSU and will consist of representatives from DAM, LGED, local\nauthorities in the districts covered by the PSU, and representatives of market vendors. Terms of\noperation of the market committees will be prepared by the PMU within six months of loan\neffectiveness.\n3. Project Management Unit\n80. Day-to-day project supervision will be through a PMU set up within DAE headquarters in\nDhaka. DAE is the appropriate location for the PMU since the intent and direction of the Project\nis very much within the mandate and purview of DAE and its operations. A Dhaka-based PMU is\nappropriate in view of the need for the PMU and its staff to liaise with a number of agencies\u2019\nhead offices.\n81. The PMU will be responsible for (i) planning, budgeting, supervising, and monitoring the\nproject implementation work of all public sector implementing agencies (DAE, DAM, LGED, and\nthe contracted research agencies); (ii) entering into and monitoring contracts and agreements\nwith the NGOs with relation to farmer mobilization, for credit provision and follow on extension\nsupport; (iii) in cooperation with Bangladesh Bank, monitoring the flow of credit to NGOs,\nfarmers, and private entrepreneurs; (iv) procuring equipment and recruiting consultants for all\ncomponents;  (v)  accounting  for  all  loan  funds,  commitments,  disbursements,  and\nreimbursements; and (vi) liaising with ADB.\n82. The PMU will be headed by a full-time, experienced, senior project director, to be\nappointed by the Ministry of Agriculture, and will comprise five units: (i) budget, planning, and\ncoordination with ADB; (ii) interagency coordination; (iii) procurement; (iv) accounting; and (v)\nmonitoring and evaluation. Each unit will be headed by competent staff of adequate seniority\nand experience.\n83. For  effective  project  implementation  and  coordination  with  the  PMU,  appropriately\nstaffed project implementation units (PIUs) will be set up within the executing and implementing\nagencies. This will entail PIUs in Bangladesh Bank, DAE, DAM, LGED, RAKUB, and each\nparticipating NGO. In addition, to ensure a field-level presence for project supervision and\ncoordination, two regional PSUs will be set up, one at Rajshahi and one at Rangpur, each under\nthe regional additional director of agriculture. These units will be responsible for overseeing and\ncoordinating project implementation in the field and will work under the guidance of the PMU.\n84. The PIUs will be responsible for the individual day-to-day implementation of the project\ncomponents  and  for  reporting  progress  under  these  components  to  the  PMU  and  will  be\nestablished within one month of loan effectiveness.", "21\n4. Specific Implementation Arrangements\na. Farmer Training and Extension Component\ni. Formulation of Training Courses\n85. DAE\u2019s Food Crops Division, under the supervision of the PMU, will be responsible for\nthe formulation of training programs suitable for promoting HVC production. Several types of\ntraining courses will be developed. These will include courses (i) aimed at training new and\nexisting staff of DAE and participating NGOs who will be carrying out institutional training\nprograms; (ii) intended to equip field staff to provide village-based training; (iii) aimed at DAE\nand NGO staff who will be providing follow-on extension support; and (iv) aimed at the majority\nof the intended beneficiaries, who will be small-scale farmers. Staff of the Food Crops Division\nwill be assisted in course formulation by a team of international and local consultants.\nii. The Training Facilities\n86. The  Project  will  use  existing  facilities  that  will  be  upgraded  to  accommodate  an\nincreased number of farmer trainees. These facilities include the four HTDCs under DAE at\nChapai  Nawabganj,  Natore,  Pabna,  and  Rangpur;  two  agriculture  training  centers  under\nparticipating NGOs (BRAC at Dinajpur and GKF at Rangpur); two horticulture training centers\nunder  BADC  at  Rajshahi  and  Bogra  and  the  Rural  Development  Academy  that  provides\nagriculture training at Bogra. All of these training facilities will be used under the Project. Terms\nand conditions for the use of these facilities will be agreed upon and finalized between the DAE\nand the facility operator prior to loan disbursement. All training facilities will be supported under\nthe Project and needs for any upgrading, equipment, and operational requirements will be\nassessed based on curriculum design and number of institutional trainees intended for each\nfacility. Assistance will be provided through local consultants for designing the upgrading works\nrequired.\niii. The Training Programs\n87. Training programs will be designed to cover all farmers interested in HVC production\nand will be oriented to less risky field crops like tubers, hybrid maize, sunflowers, legumes,\nspices, hardy vegetables, and fruit crops such as banana and papaya. Village-based training\ncourses will also be designed for farmers not able or willing to participate in the institution-based\ntraining program. Courses designed for village-based training will resemble the institution-based\ncourses for the small-scale farmers but will be implemented in accordance with a schedule\ndeveloped in consultation with the participating farmers.\niv. Follow-Up Activities\n88. Follow-up  field  training  for  participants  will  be  provided  during  crop  production  and\nmarketing. This will be organized by DAE in coordination with NGOs and will use the DAE field\nstaff (block supervisors), supplemented by NGO staff trained in horticulture. Wherever possible,\nparticipants will be encouraged to form marketing groups to help defray marketing costs and\nnegotiate bulk purchasers. Some NGOs already have vertically integrated programs, which\ninclude the marketing of produce grown by participating farmers or grown on a contract basis.\nWhere possible, the PMU will try to locate focus areas of the Project where such programs are\nactive, especially in the early years of project implementation.", "22\nb.  Farmer Mobilization and Credit Component\ni. Identification and Mobilization of Farmers\n89. Identifying  and  mobilizing  farmer  participants  for  the  Project  will  be  an  interactive\nprocess entailing coordination between the staff of DAE and the NGOs. This will involve the\nparticipating NGOs and DAE publicizing the Project; and the NGOs selecting participants based\non agreed selection criteria and undertaking group formation. NGOs will be encouraged to\nidentify  and  mobilize  households  headed  by  women,  and  progressive  women  farmers  to\nparticipate in the Project, wherever possible. The Project beneficiaries will be those who (i) own\nand operate landholdings of at least 0.2 ha and no more than 1.2 ha, (ii) have landholdings in\nsubdistricts identified as having good potential for HVCs, (iii) have access to primary markets,\n(iv) indicate a willingness to participate in group activities, and (v) have not already received\nsupport for HVC from some other source.\nii. Credit Provision for Crop Diversification\n90. About 160,000 of the planned 200,000 trainees35 will opt to take credit packages from\nparticipating  NGOs  after  completing  their  initial  training  program.  Selection  criteria  for  the\nprovision of credit (in addition to criteria for participation in the training program) will include\nsuccessful completion of the institutional training course or a minimum number of village-based\ntraining sessions, plus any other reasonable criteria a particular NGO may wish to impose. The\ncredit packages will be based on farmers\u2019 proposals and will depend to a large extent on the\ntype of crop to be grown and the area to be planted. A maximum loan size of Tk10,000 ($200)\nwill be allowed. Terms and conditions of the credit packages will be based on each individual\nNGO's practices, which currently entail interest rates of 15-20 percent. In the interest of equity\namong participating beneficiaries, some broad standards will be maintained for the size of credit\npackages provided, interest rates, and repayment periods. The Government has agreed to\ncoordinate with and among the NGOs to develop acceptable and standard terms and conditions\nfor the provision of subloans to beneficiaries. The allocation of funds to each NGO for credit\nprovision  will  be  based  on  the  number  of  farmers  to  be  covered  and  will  be  decided  by\nagreement between DAE and each NGO, and incorporated in the contracts. Disbursements will\nbe made on the basis of agreed annual work plans.\niii. Interaction with Participating NGOs\n91. A  final  selection  of  NGOs  to  participate  in  the  Project  was  confirmed  during  loan\nnegotiations.  Furthermore,  as  a  condition  of  loan  disbursement,  contracts  will  be  signed\nbetween the PMU and the selected NGOs specifying, among other things, the subdistricts in\nwhich the NGOs will operate, the roles of the NGO and of DAE in farmer mobilization and\ntraining, the operational and coordination arrangements between DAE and the NGO, the target\nnumber of farmers per subdistrict, agreed selection criteria for participating farmers, the size of\ncredit packages to be promoted, general parameters relating to interest rates and repayment\nperiods of the credit packages, and the fee to be provided to the NGO for its services.\niv. On-Lending and Relending Conditions for Farmers' Credit\n92. The Government will make the agriculture credit funds available to Bangladesh Bank\nunder a financing agreement, with interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum and a repayment\n                  \n35 Assuming a drop out rate of 20 percent based on NGO experience and discussions with extension staff and\nfarmers in the field.", "23\nperiod of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. The Bangladesh Bank, in turn, will\nchannel the funds to the selected NGOs, through RAKUB (para. 76), on terms and conditions\nlaid down in a subsidiary loan agreement between them, satisfactory to the Government and\nADB. Similar agreements will be signed between RAKUB and the NGOs, detailing the terms\nand conditions for relending and repayments. NGOs will be provided funds at the prevailing\nPKSF lending rates to NGOs with a repayment period of up to two years.36 Disbursements to\nthe NGOs will be made semiannually and will be based on agreed annual work plans submitted\nby the PMU to Bangladesh Bank. The NGOs will provide funds to participating farmers at\nagreed terms and conditions satisfactory to the Government and the ADB.\n93. Any decision to use a credit channeling agency other than RAKUB will require ADB\u2019s\nprior approval, and the proposed agency will be required to meet qualification criteria agreed\nupon by the Government, Bangladesh Bank, and ADB.\nc. Adaptive Research component\n94. The adaptive research will be undertaken under the supervision of the PMU.  The PMU\nwill assess and finance the upgrading requirements of the horticulture research centers in the\nnorthwest region; finance the establishment of a horticulture data bank at the Bangladesh\nAgriculture Research Institute (BARI); and (based on proposals and requests from the extension\nworkers, NGOs and DAE, or the HTDCs), contract adaptive research projects to research\nagencies in the region. The operation of the contract research system will be designed in the\nfirst year of project implementation by the research management consultant to be recruited in\nthe PMU.\nd.  Marketing Support component\ni. Market Information\n95. The market information subcomponent will entail formulating a market information and\ndissemination strategy, training DAM staff in market information collection and dissemination,\npreparing broadcast modules for the dissemination of market information by radio, and training\nDAM staff to do market surveys. Consulting services, staff training, vehicles, and equipment\nsupport will be provided to assist DAM with the market information and dissemination. The\npreparation of broadcast modules will be contracted out to an appropriately qualified media\ncompany.\nii. Market Infrastructure\n96. The preliminary identification of primary and growers' markets for upgrading will be done\nby DAM based on market surveys and studies, some of which are already completed and some\nof which will be undertaken under the Project. Candidate markets for upgrading will be proposed\nto  the  market  infrastructure  committees,  and  recommendations  of  the  committees  will  be\ndiscussed with the relevant local administration (districts in the case of growers' markets and\nsubdistricts in the case of primary markets) prior to final funding approval by the PMU.  Market\nconstruction/upgrading will then be arranged directly between the PMU and LGED.  The LGED\nPIU will be responsible for implementation.\n97. With regard to market O&M, the PMU will direct a regionwide market management\nstudy,  using  international  and  domestic  consultants.  On  the  basis  of  the  study\u2019s\n                  \n36 The current PKSF rate for large NGOs is 7.0 percent.", "24\nrecommendations  and  consultation  with  local  authorities  and  representative  private  sector\nstakeholders, management options will be developed, implemented, and monitored. The options\nwill be adjusted, as appropriate throughout the project implementation period.  In developing the\noptions,  particular  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  governance  and  on  developing  viable  and\nsustainable public-private partnerships in market management.\ne. Pilot Agribusiness Credit component\n98. The pilot agribusiness component will be undertaken by RAKUB. Potential borrowers will\nbe identified through advertisements in newspapers in Dhaka and the northwest region. The\nadvertisements will explain the nature of the component, the types of enterprises to be provided\ncredit, the counterpart financing requirements, and the need for preinvestment technical and\nfinancial feasibility studies.\n99. Funds for the credit line will be made available from the Government to Bangladesh\nBank, at interest rate of 3 percent and repayment period of 20 years including a grace period of\n5 years. Bangladesh Bank will on-lend the funds to RAKUB at the Bangladesh Bank rate.37\nRAKUB in turn will relend the funds to interested agribusiness entrepreneurs at their standard\ncommercial terms and conditions. The entrepreneurs will be registered within the existing legal\nframework for the establishment and operation of agribusiness enterprises (packaging, cold\nstorages  for  potato,  vegetables,  feed  mills,  seed  processing,  specialized  refrigerated\ntransportation, etc.), and will provide at least 25 percent of the equity from their own resources.\nThe maximum loan size will be $150,000. Any loan above $100,000 will require the prior\napproval of ADB. Interest rates will be the market rates prevailing for similar commercial RAKUB\nloans and repayment periods will be agreed between RAKUB and the entrepreneur, based on\nprojected cash flows of enterprise to be financed. To secure a loan, the Borrower will be\nrequired  to  provide  collateral  acceptable  to  the  lending  institution.  ADB  will  review  the\ncomponent fully after 50 percent of funds under the credit line have been disbursed.\n5. Project Implementation Schedule\n100. The Project is innovative in implementing the DAE-NGO partnership for extension and\ntraining  and  bringing  the  NGOs  into  agricultural  credit  for  small-scale  farmers.  Some\ncomponents  may  therefore  take  time  to  be  set  up  and  become  fully  operational.  Training\nprograms and training materials will need to be formulated; DAE staff and NGO staff will need to\nbe trained; and, before the program can begin, the training facilities will need to be upgraded\nand  the  program  publicized  in  the  project  area  so  that  farmers  can  express  interest  and\ncommitment. Market surveys will be needed before the marketing infrastructure component can\nbegin. A seven-year implementation period has therefore been planned, with the first year\nconsidered a start-up phase and the remaining six years as the implementation phase. Some of\nthe market information work, the adaptive research work, the market infrastructure work, and\nthe  pilot  agribusiness  credit  provision  could,  however,  commence  within  the  first  year.  An\nimplementation schedule is given in Appendix 7.\n6. Procurement\n101. Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement. The major items to be procured will be equipment and materials, as\nwell as a relatively modest amount of civil works. Equipment will consist of office, training, and\nresearch  equipment  for  the  PIUs,  HTDCs,  village-based  training  program,  and  horticulture\n                  \n37 Bangladesh Bank rate is the rate at which the Central Bank lends funds to commercial banks.", "25\nresearch centers. A modest number of vehicles will also be procured to allow mobility of field\nand headquarters staff and consultants. Materials to be procured will largely consist of training\nmaterials for the training programs, including approximately 200,000 copies of training and field\nmanuals  for  farmer  participants.  Civil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  consist  of  the\nupgrading of HTDCs, and the construction/upgrading of primary and growers' markets.\n102. All procurement will generally be undertaken by the PMU after agreement with the\nrelevant  PIU  on  the  scope,  nature,  and  specifications  of  the  items  to  be  procured.  Items\nprocured by the subborrowers under the pilot agricultural credit line will be procured through\ndirect purchase in accordance with established commercial practices. Since all civil works\nprocured under the Project will be simple in nature, dispersed throughout the northwest region\nand relatively small in size,38 an international firm is not likely to be interested in bidding for\nthem. Moreover, works of this nature can be successfully completed to acceptable standards by\nlocal contractors. Civil works will thus be awarded through local competitive bidding procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n103. Vehicles and equipment will be procured through international shopping for packages\ncosting more than $100,000 and less than $500,000, and by direct purchase for packages\ncosting  less  than  $100,000.  Service  contracts  and  contracts  for  training  materials  will  be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified local firms, institutes, and\nagencies  using  ADB  guidelines.  Service  contracts  for  NGOs  will  be  by  direct  purchase,\nnegotiated on the basis of preselection of NGOs according to selection criteria agreed between\nthe  Government  and  ADB  (see  Appendix  8)  and  with  payments  of  standard  fees  per\nparticipating farmer. Appendix 9 gives an indicative list of procurement packages showing size\nand method of procurement.\n7. Consulting Services\n104. The project will require 582 person-months of consulting services consisting of 124\nperson-months of international and 458 person-months of local expert services. Most of this\nexpertise will be for the formulation of the training programs and for assistance with project\nstart-up and management.  Some local and international expertise will also be provided to DAM\nfor designing a program of data collection and dissemination and to provide associated training.\nConsulting services will also be provided to assist local authorities in formulating and testing\nimproved management systems for primary and grower markets. Service contracts will include\ncontracts  between  the  PMU  and  participating  NGOs,  contracts  with  a  media  company  to\nprepare broadcast modules for the DAM, a contract to prepare the horticulture research data\nbank, contracts with horticulture research centers to undertake adaptive research, and contracts\nfor  periodic  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Indicative  terms  of  reference  for\nconsulting services are presented in Appendix 10.\n105. All consulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. Since specialized expertise and experience will be required for the formulation of\ntraining courses and implementation of training programs, consultants for this component will be\nrecruited as a team from a reputed agriculture training institution, possibly in combination with a\nsuitably qualified consulting firm. All other consultants will be recruited as teams from qualified\nconsulting firms in accordance with the packages shown in Appendix 10, except for the adaptive\nresearch and seed verification specialists who, because of the nature of expertise required, will\nbe recruited as individual consultants.\n                  \n38The largest single contract is unlikely to exceed $350,000.", "26\n106. The Government will advance action in respect of consultant recruitment procedures to\nthe stage of shortlisting, to expedite the Project once the proposed loan is approved.\n8. Training\n107. Training activities will be an integral part of the Project with one whole component\ndevoted  to  the  training  of  DAE  and  NGO  field  and  extension  workers  as  well  as  farmer\nparticipants. Under this component, about 600 professional staff of DAE and the NGOs will\nreceive  training  in  the  production  and  marketing  of  HVCs  and  in  extension  and  farmer\nmobilization  techniques.  About  200,000  small-scale  farmers  will  receive  training  at  centers\nupgraded by the Project or village-based training through their NGO groups, supplemented by\ninput from DAE staff. In addition, in the Project provides for the training of DAM staff. This will\ninclude on-the-job training by local and international consultants and study tours to observe\nmarket management and information dissemination systems in relevant neighboring countries.\n9. Operation and Maintenance\n108. As the Project is largely credit based and will, to a considerable extent, use existing\nfacilities and services (HTDCs; the staff of DAE, DAM, and LGED; the staff of participating\nNGOs; and the services of Bangladesh Bank and RAKUB) large incremental O&M costs are not\nenvisaged. The major operational expenditures will be the costs of the training program (about\n$400,00 per year over the project period), the O&M costs of the upgraded HTDCs (about\n$100,000 per year) and the O&M costs of the markets (about $10,000 per market per year for\nprimary markets and $20,000 per market per year for growers' markets).\n109. The Project will cover training program O&M costs during the project period, but will firm\nup modalities and arrangements to make the training program and the HTDCs self-financing.\nThe Government has agreed that various modalities will be investigated during the project\nperiod, including possible rental of the facilities to NGOs/private sector entities, and will be\nagreed upon during the mid term review.\n110. The O&M of market facilities in Bangladesh and in the northwest region in particular is\nalready undertaken following established procedures that entail leasing the facilities by local\nauthorities to private sector management contractors on an annual basis. This allows some of\nthe fees collected to be returned through O&M financing. However, considerable amounts of the\nfees are lost. This situation will be addressed under the Project through a study on market\nmanagement which will present alternative O&M formulations to local authorities. During the\nproject period, local authorities participating in the market infrastructure component will be\nencouraged, under the guidance of staff of DAM, LGED, and the PMU, to implement different\nO&M formulations until optimal solutions are found. In doing so, particular emphasis will be\nplaced on developing public-private sector partnerships in market management. The options will\nthen provide demonstration cases to other local authorities, giving an incentive to improve and\nupgrade market management throughout the region. The Government has indicated that a\ncommitment  to  improve  market  O&M  procedures  will  be  a  part  of  the  market  upgrading\nagreement signed with local authorities prior to market improvement.", "27\n10.  Sustainability\n111. Large incremental O&M costs are not envisaged (para. 108). Upon project completion,\nthe only facilities that will require continued financial support by the Government will be the\ntraining centers. The Government has agreed to investigate modalities to make the centers self-\nfinancing (para. 56). Even if no means of financing the centers are formulated, the cost of\nrunning them is expected to be modest (about $100,000 per annum).\n112. The main operational costs after the project period will be the costs of agricultural inputs\nthe farmers use for continued diversified crop production and the operating costs for markets\nupgraded under the Project. On Project completion, the participating NGOs should be able to\ncontinue their agriculture credit and training activities with funds generated from other sources,\nincluding the interest spread on their microfinance activities and borrowings from the proposed\nKrishi Rin Foundation. In the case of markets, while the cost of market construction will be met\nby the Government during the project period, the cost of market maintenance will be borne by\nthe  private  sector  users  of  the  market  facilities,  through  fees  to  market  lessees  who  are\ncontracted by the market committee to operate them.\n11.  Beneficiary Participation\n113. The Project is designed to be demand-driven and participatory, especially the training\nand  extension  and  the  farmer  mobilization  and  credit  components.  The  program  and\nqualification criteria for these components will be publicized within the target subdistricts by the\nDAE and the NGOs, and farmers who meet the selection criteria will be encouraged to enlist in\nthe Project. Once enrolled in the program, participating farmers will decide which of the training\ncourses to attend, which crops they will grow, how much land will be planted to HVCs, and the\nsize of the credit package they will receive from the NGOs (depending on the crop and area to\nbe planted).  Given the important role played by women in crop production in the project area,\nthe NGOs will ensure that farmers\u2019 groups include both men and women, in mixed or separate\ngroups, as appropriate.  Project monitoring activities will be designed to include feedback so\nthat the experience and views of farmers who have participated can be reviewed by the PMU,\nallowing appropriate changes in design, the training program, or the credit provision to be made\nduring the midterm review. The pilot agribusiness component has also been designed so that\nparticipants enroll themselves, and similar feedback mechanisms will be built into the monitoring\nprocedures. For market upgrading, beneficiary participation will consist of interaction between\nthe local government authority planning the market, market users and the LGED, which will be\npreparing individual market designs. Subdistrict and district market committees will be the forum\nfor this interaction for the primary and growers\u2019 markets, respectively.\n12. Disbursement Procedures\n114. To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and counterpart funds and to expedite\nproject implementation, the Government will, immediately after the loan becomes effective,\nestablish  three  imprest  accounts  in  Bangladesh  Bank,  one  for  the  PMU  to  cover  funding\nrequirements for the public sector agencies with an initial amount of not more than $1,000,000\nequivalent, one for Bangladesh Bank to provide for the flow of credit funds to the participating\nNGOs with an initial amount of not more than $500,000 equivalent, and one for Bangladesh\nBank  to  finance  the  pilot  agribusiness  credit  line  with  an  initial  amount  of  not  more  than\n$100,000. Payments may be made from and to the accounts for all eligible expenditures under\nthe Project. The first account will be operated and managed by the PMU and the second two by\nthe  Bangladesh  Bank,  in  accordance  with  ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditure procedure will be used for liquidating advance payments from the\nimprest accounts, not exceeding $50,000 equivalent.", "28\n13.  Revolving Funds\n115. Two revolving funds will be set up within the first year of project implementation to allow\nfor continued use of funds provided under the crop production credit and the agribusiness credit\nline. The revolving funds will be established in the Bangladesh Bank rather than RAKUB to\nallow  flexibility  to  change  the  credit  channeling  agency,  if  necessary,  during  the  project\nimplementation. The revolving funds will be operated by the Bangladesh Bank throughout the\nproject life and for a further 10 years after project completion. The Bangladesh Bank will assign\nand retain one senior officer to manage the two funds.\n14. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n116. Each PIU will establish and maintain accounts and records of project progress and\nexpenditures to facilitate the identification of income and expenditures related to the Project.\nThe PIU staff will each be assisted in this by staff from the PMU, which will have an adequate\nnumber of accounting staff, including two accountants dedicated solely to monitoring project\nexpenses, reimbursement, and accounts. The PMU will be responsible for consolidating all\naccounts and submitting all reimbursement requests to ADB. Audited accounts and financial\nstatements, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of\nthe close of the related financial year.\n117. Each PIU will prepare quarterly progress reports, which the PMU will consolidate into\nproject reports. The reports will detail the achievements related to the implementation schedule,\ntargets and plans for the next reporting period, problems requiring resolution, and the steps\nbeing taken to resolve them.\n118. Within three months of project closing, DAE will prepare a project completion report for\nsubmission to ADB. The report will detail the results and achievements of the Project, provide\nan analysis of the funds spent, and indicate measures to ensure the sustainability of project\ninvestments.\n15. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n119. Project benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) will take place at two levels. The first\nlevel will be that of the individual farmer participant and will be based on reports provided by the\nparticipating NGOs on the progress and success in HVC production by their participating farmer\nbeneficiaries. This will be measured by factors such as the level of repayment and the number\nof repeat loans, as well as through participant farmer surveys, using the high ratio of staff to\nbeneficiary\u2019s characteristic of NGO operations. At a broader, more general level, BME surveys\nwill be undertaken annually during the second phase of the Project by an institution or agency\ncontracted by the PMU. The factors to be monitored will include the number of beneficiaries\nattending the institutional and village-based training programs, the overall number of people\nreceiving credit, overall repayment rates for all NGOs, changes in income levels for participants,\nand cropping patterns in participating subdistricts. A baseline survey covering this information\nwill be undertaken at the beginning of the Project to provide a benchmark. Major indicators will\nbe developed based on the benchmark survey by the BME consultant for monitoring during the\nproject period.", "29\n16. Midterm Review\n120. A comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken at the end of the third year of\nimplementation. The purpose of the review will be to critically evaluate the progress of the\nProject, the validity of the implementation procedures, the efficiency of the flow of funds to\nNGOs and their ability to use them effectively, the performance of the training programs, and\nthe performance of the pilot agribusiness credit line. Also during the midterm review, a decision\nwill be taken regarding whether to involve other financing agencies, such as the proposed Krishi\nRin Foundation. Following the review, corrective measures will be introduced as appropriate to\nremedy weaknesses.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n121. An initial environmental examination was undertaken for the proposed Project to identify\nenvironmental issues and required mitigating measures. Overall, the Project is unlikely to have\nany major negative environmental impacts. However, attention will need to be paid to the\neffective and safe use of fertilizers, pesticides and groundwater. The commercial production of\nHVCs tends to be input intensive and could lead to higher levels of pesticide, fertilizer, and\ngroundwater use than would occur with some traditional crops (although water use would be\nless than with rice). While the overall area to be brought into the production of HVCs is quite\nsmall (50,000 ha out of some cultivated area of 4.0 million ha) localized concentrations of HVC\nproduction may cause some concern. To mitigate against any problems arising, the training\nprograms  for  participating  farmers  will  place  a  strong  emphasis  on  appropriate  and  safe\npesticide and fertilizer use (including integrated pest management measures)39 and on the\nefficient use of irrigation water. The Project will construct training centers, minor markets, and\ngrowers\u2019 markets. This will, however, be a small portion of the total activities and the overall\nimpact is likely to be limited. Markets may have a few longer-term impacts during operation due\nto  waste  water  and  waste  production  disposal.  These  issues  will  be  addressed  through\nimproved  market  operation  and  management  systems,  which  will  be  developed  and\nimplemented during the Project. The Project also provides for a domestic consultant to monitor\nthe environmental impact of project activities throughout the implementation period.\n2. Social Measures\n122. Eighty-six percent of the population of the northwest region (27.3 million people) is rural\nand thus dependent on agriculture for a livelihood. The 1996 agricultural census reported 3.2\nmillion farm households in the northwest region, and 1.9 million landless rural households.\nLandholding households include 2.5 million small and marginal farmers (.02-1.0 ha), 0.6 million\nmedium (1.0-3.0 ha) and 0.1 million large farmers (over 3.0 ha). With increasing population,\nfarm  sizes  have  decreased  and  landlessness  has  increased.  With  few  sources  of  income\noutside of agriculture, farm size and productivity is directly linked to levels of poverty and\nprosperity.  Thus, while the landless and marginal landholding families are, almost by definition\npoor, many small-scale farmers waver on the boundary between poor and non-poor; a marginal\ndrop in their income levels could place them into a poverty trap. Lack of employment is also a\nsevere problem. Agriculture does not generate enough full-time employment opportunities and\noff-farm employment opportunities are limited.  Poverty is, therefore, pervasive. The incidence\n                  \n39 Taking into account ADB\u2019s Handbook for Incorporation of Integrated Pest Management in Agriculture Projects.", "30\nof poverty measured by the head-count index of poverty40 indicated that 62.2 percent of the total\npopulation of Rajshahi Division was poor during 1995-1996, which was substantially higher than\nthe national figure of 53.1 percent.\n123. One of the main outcomes of the Project is expected to be a decrease in the levels of\npoverty in the project area through increased incomes of small-scale farmers and an increase in\nbusiness  and  employment  opportunities.  Although  the  project  benefits  will  be  distributed\nprimarily to small-scale farmers, landless laborers and marginal farmers will benefit through\nincreased employment opportunities in planting, harvesting, and transport, as well as indirectly\nthrough employment generated by agroprocessing and marketing.\n124. Women's participation in income generating activities in the Project area is constrained\nby cultural and religious traditions, burdensome household duties, early marriage, and child-\nrearing. These also prevent women from continuing their education and their exposure to skill\nenhancement  and  economic  opportunities  remains  limited.  Nonetheless,  women  play  an\nimportant role in agricultural activities, especially in small landholding families. Furthermore,\nabout 11-15 percent of the households in the project area is headed by women.41 The project\ndesign has thus taken into account the opportunities the project will open for women in the\nproject area.\n125. Notably, the NGOs that will participate in the Project already have a strong bias toward\nwomen in their programs: more than 50 percent of their lending activities have historically been\nfor women.  This has led to a change in the perception of women in the project area, and the\nNGOs  often  employ  women  extension  workers  and  field  trainers.  Beneficiary  and  training\ngroups  comprising  both  men  and  women  are  common  and  accepted.  During  project\nimplementation, efforts will be made to ensure full access to the training, extension, and credit\nprograms for women.  To assist in this, a gender specialist consultant has been included in the\nPMU.  A summary gender strategy is placed in Appendix 11.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n126. Financial and economic analyses have been undertaken for increased HVC production\nfrom farmers who are expected to participate in NGO programs for crop diversification and\nintensification, the main quantifiable benefit arising from the Project. Other economic benefits\naccruing from the Project but not quantified include loss reductions and reduced marketing\ncosts through improvements to the growers\u2019 markets, reduced costs of marketing and higher\nproduce values at village markets, increased value added due to the pilot agribusiness credit\nline, and increased production from farmers who do not participate in NGO programs but adopt\nHVC production. Detailed economic and financial analyses have been carried out and the\nresults are summarized in Appendix 12.\n127. Over the seven-year project life, about 160,000 farmers are expected to form HVC\nproduction  and  marketing  groups,  undergo  field  and  institutional  training,  and  take  credit\npackages from participating NGOs. On this basis, at maturity, the project will provide a total\nincremental value added to the sector of $27.9 million per annum.\n                  \n40The head count index (HCI) measures the percentage of the population living in households with per capita\nconsumption that is less than the poverty line, based on calorie intake data.\n41 Estimated by the Department of Women\u2019s Affairs.", "31\n1. Financial Analysis\n128. Illustrative crop budgets have been formulated to assess the profitability of individual\ncrops. Project cost and benefit estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and are well\nbelow potential under ideal conditions using recommended technical packages. Farm model\nfinancial analysis has been undertaken for six potential farm models, representing two farm\nsizes (1.0 ha, and 0.5 ha) and three diversification options. Return on investment is projected at\nan average of 39 percent for 1 ha farms and 48 percent for 0.5 ha farms. Average annual net\nfarm incomes are expected to increase to about $284 for the 0.5 ha farms, and $525 for the 1.0\nha farms compared to their current income levels of $217 and $434, respectively. The average\nannual labor requirement is expected to increase by 18 days for the 0.5 ha farms and 37 days\nfor the 1.0 ha farms, while returns per labor-day are expected to increase by 19 and 10 percent\nrespectively.  The  incremental  returns  per  incremental  labor-day  are  well  in  excess  of  the\nprevailing daily wage rate for unskilled agricultural labor in all farm models. The increased labor\ndemand is well within the capacity of typical small farm households. For larger farms, seasonal\nfarm labor is also available for hire in the project area.\n2. Economic Analysis\n129. The Project\u2019s economic viability was estimated on the assumption of a project life of 20\nyears, an investment period of 6 years, and an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent.\nFinancial prices of nontraded commodities have been converted to economic prices by using a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.89. As there is a surplus of labor in the project area, shadow\npricing of wage rates has been applied at 80 percent of the basic daily wage rate in the analysis.\n130. Incremental  economic  benefits  for  each  farm  model  were  assessed  using  the\nappropriate economic prices for inputs and outputs, and the results were aggregated based on\nexpectations of the frequency that each type of diversification strategy would be adopted and\nthe size distribution derived from the 1996 agricultural census. Economic costs of Project inputs,\nexcluding  credit,  were  estimated  by  deducting  taxes,  duties,  and  price  contingencies,  and\nconverting local prices to economic values using the standard conversion factor.\n131. On these assumptions, the economic internal rate of return for HVC production was\nestimated at 30.7 percent. Standard sensitivity analyses indicate that the Project is sufficiently\nrobust.\nTable 3: Economic Analyses and Sensitivity Analyses\nDetails EIRR (%) Switching\nValues (%)\nBase Case 30.7\n10% Cost Overrun 20.3 17.3\n10% Decline in Benefits 16.8 13.2\nCombination of Benefit 4.0\n   Decline and Cost Overrun\n1 year Delay in Benefits 26.5\n       Source: Mission estimates.", "32\nB. Environment\n132. The Project is not expected to have any major negative environmental impacts. While\nincreased production of HVCs has an inherent danger of increased and inappropriate use of\npesticides and fertilizers, the crop production packages to be promoted under the Project will\nemphasize  appropriate  inputs  and  the  use  of  integrated  pest  management  in  line  with\nGovernment policy. Diversification away from rice and into HVCs will result in more efficient use\nof  irrigation  water,  which  will  be  environmentally  positive.  Where  possible,  the  Project  will\npromote further efficiencies in water use and the adoption of improved technologies. Careful\nattention will need to be given to ensuring appropriate rotations as repeated production of a crop\non the same piece of land is likely to have negative impacts on soil quality and pest and disease\noccurrence.  The  proposed  extent  of  HVCs  in  the  farm  plans  should  allow  adequate\nopportunities for rotations. Many HVCs also produce a significant amount of residues and\nunmarketable produce, which should be recycled. However, care will need to be taken to\nminimize the promotion of plant diseases from crop wastes.\n133. Investments in primary and grower markets will result in the concentration of large\namounts of perishable plant material in a small area. Without proper waste disposal, this may\nresult in an environmental hazard. Proper management of the waste will be a concern of the\nsupport given to market management.\n134. While the activities to be refinanced under the agribusiness pilot credit line are not yet\nidentified, their impact is likely to be localized due to the small size of the ventures to be\nfinanced. Impacts of concern will be waste disposal, dust, and noise. These will be monitored to\nensure that acceptable standards are maintained.\nC. Social Impact\n135. Under the training and credit support program, the Project will reach approximately\n160,000 farm households whose landholdings are about 0.2-1.2 ha each. Given the strong\ncorrelation of poverty with land ownership42 in the project area, about 50 percent of the small\nfarm households are poor. About 75,000 poor farm households are thus estimated to benefit\ndirectly from the Project.\n136. While small-scale farmers will directly benefit from technical assistance to diversify into\ncash  crop  production  and  enhanced  credit  access  provided  by  the  Project,  some  indirect\nbenefits  through  employment  generation  are  also  expected.  Improved  crop  production  will\nrequire an additional 4.4 million labor days per annum. Additional labor of family members is\nlikely  to  suffice  for  a  large  portion  of  the  labor  requirement.  However,  the  employment\ngeneration impact will be positive and crucial, especially on the 1.9 million landless households\nin the region who heavily depend on income from paid agricultural labor, as small landholders\ncommonly  hire  agricultural  seasonal  labor,  especially  during  harvest  season.  In  addition,\nnoncrop  income  generating  activities  are  expected  to  emerge  as  a  linkage  effect  of  HVC\nproduction. Such income generating activities have already been practiced in a small scale in\nthe project area, and the generation of additional business opportunities is likely to benefit the\nentire rural population.\n                  \n42 According to the World Bank (1998) Bangladesh From Counting the Poor to Making the Poor Count, the poor\npopulation account for 43-70 percent among small-scale farmers, 32 percent among medium-scale farmers, and 9\npercent among large-scale farmers in rural area.", "33\n137. No large adverse impact of the Project is expected and several positive indirect impacts\nare likely to benefit the entire rural population. While small-scale farmers directly benefit from\nthe  Project,  landless  and  marginal  landholders  will  benefit  from  increased  agricultural\nemployment and business in the project area. Women and ethnic minority groups will directly\nand indirectly benefit from the Project.\n138. With technical, physical, financial, and marketing support of the Project, the current\nenvironment provides ample opportunities for small-scale farmers in the project area to benefit\nconsiderably from producing HVCs, and many of them will gradually diversify their crops during\nthe project period. As the early participants achieve improved incomes, even relatively risk\nadverse  farmers  can  be  expected  to  gradually  diversify  their  crops.  Given  the  prevalent\nunemployment  and  underemployment  situation,  the  need  for  income-generating  sources  is\nacute and the demand for crop diversification is strong in the project area. The opening of the\nJamuna bridge has improved the distribution and domestic trading of agricultural produce of the\nproject area, and provided a new opportunity for export marketing.43 Some cold storage facilities\nhave been established, and the distribution network of vegetable and fruits through middlemen\nhas expanded. Although the expanded trading has tended to benefit the traders more than\nfarmers, farmers in the project area now recognize that they have more options for marketing of\ntheir produce.\nD. Risks\n139.  To minimize the risks involved in implementation, the project design has been built\nfirmly on the ongoing reforms and the new extension policy of the Government. This involves, in\nparticular, decentralized extension, increased involvement of the NGO and private sector in\nagriculture  support  services,  improvements  to  marketing,  and  promotion  of  agribusiness\ninvolvement in output processing in order to increase value added. Nevertheless several risks\ncould affect the overall success of the Project.\n140. First,  failure  of  the  participating  farmers  to  successfully  use  credit  could  lead  to  a\nreduction in the projected incremental income of subborrowers, which, in turn, would reduce the\nProject\u2019s benefits to individual farmers as well as its overall benefits. The project design is\ntherefore based on the provision of credit only to farmers who have undergone adequate\ntraining in HVC production. In addition, the project design provides for follow up support for the\nparticipating farmers covering crop production and marketing by DAE and the NGOs.\n141. Second, it is important that training courses are formulated in the early part of the\nProject, and DAE and NGO staff undergo training in the promotion and technical aspects of\nHVC production. Any delay in completing these activities may impede the full-scale start of\nproject activities, and, given the seasonal nature of much HVC production, could result in a\nyear\u2019s loss of activities. To avoid delays in this important start-up activity, international and\ndomestic consulting services are provided to help the PMU design and implement the training\nprogram.\n142. Third, the Project will entail an innovative partnership between DAE and participating\nNGOs.  Initiating this partnership and operating it will have risks. The first steps in DAE-NGO\ncooperation for the Project have already been through a joint workshop organized during the\nappraisal mission. Based on discussions with all participating NGOs and the staff of DAE, a\ncoordination committee has been included in the project design to meet regularly and resolve\npractical implementation problems. To further minimize the risks and ensure clear delineation of\n                  \n43 For instance, BRAC has assisted qualified farmers in the project area under its Vegetable Export Program.", "34\nresponsibilities, the formulation of draft contracts between the DAE and the NGOs was a\ncondition  of  loan  negotiations  and  the  signing  of  such  contracts  is  a  condition  of  loan\ndisbursement.\n143. Fourth, is the risk of poor coordination between agencies at the field level. The project\ndesign takes this risk into account and has provided for (i) two coordination committees, one for\nDAE-NGOs and the other for market infrastructure; and (ii) two project supervision units in the\nproject area.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Project Specific Assurances\n144. In addition to the standard covenants and assurances the Government has agreed to the\nfollowing:\n(i) The Government will establish the PMU at Dhaka, headed by a full-time, senior,\nexperienced project director; appoint a sufficient number of staff with adequate\nseniority  and  experience  for  the  PMU\u2019s  operation;  and  provide  the  support\nnecessary for full supervision and management of the Project.\n(ii)  The  Government  will  establish  PIUs  in  each  implementing  agency  and  two\nproject  coordination  and  supervision  units  in  DAE  facilities  in  the  northwest\nregion,  and  provide  them  with  requisite  staff  and  operational  and  logistical\nsupport.\n(iii) From  the  third  year  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  devise  alternative\nsustainable financing arrangements to make the HTDCs at least partially self-\nfinancing.\n(iv) Starting with markets upgraded by the Project, the Government with the local\nauthorities,  will  implement  improved  market  management  and  financing\nprocedures to ensure proper market maintenance.\n(v)  The Government will ensure that full financing is available in DAM\u2019s annual\nbudget  for  continued  operation  of  the  communication  equipment  and  daily\nbroadcasts.\n(vi) Agreements will be reached between DAE and operator of identified training\ncenters on the use of their facilities for training staff and beneficiaries under the\nProject.\n(vii)  Terms of reference for the DAE-NGO coordination committee and the market\ncoordination committees will be formulated by the PMU, in coordination with\nconcerned NGOs within the first six months of loan effectiveness.\n(viii)  Two  separate  revolving  funds  will  be  set  up,  within  Bangladesh  Bank,  for\nrecovered  loan  funds  from  the  crop  production  credit,  and  for  the  pilot\nagribusiness credit line, to allow these funds to be recycled for continued use.\n(ix)  The Government will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the existing\nBADC retail seed outlets and of the fertilizer distribution system, and will provide\nto  ADB  by  June  2001  the  outcome  and  timetable  for  further  action.  The\nGovernment will also reassess and reformulate the procedures for seed imports,\ntesting, and approval by December 2001.", "35\n(x)  The Government will not make any plan or implement debt amnesty or other\nforgiveness of loan repayment obligations under crop production or agribusiness\ncredit.\n(xi)  The Government will ensure the compliance of the Project gender strategy.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n145. Two conditions the Government has agreed to meet prior to loan effectiveness are\n(i)  PMU will have been set up and staffed satisfactorily to ADB, including the project\ndirector and heads of all units in the PMU; and\n(ii)  financing agreements for crop production and agribusiness credit will have been\nsigned between the Ministry of Finance and the Bangladesh Bank, setting out the\nterms and conditions for relending from the Government to Bangladesh Bank.\nC.  Conditions for Disbursement\n146. Three conditions the Government has agreed to meet prior to the first loan disbursement\nare that\n(i)  agreements will have been signed between the Government and the participating\nNGOs,  setting  out  the  terms  of  cooperation  for  project  implementation,  the\nsubdistricts  in  which  particular  NGOs  will  be  active,  the  parameters  for\ndetermining  the  on-lending  rate  from  NGOs  to  participating  farmers  and  the\ntarget number of farmer participants which each NGO will aim to bring into the\nProject;\n(ii)  for  the  crop  production  and  agribusiness  components,  subsidiary  loan\nagreements will have been signed between the Bangladesh Bank and RAKUB,\nsetting out the terms and conditions for lending from the Bangladesh Bank to\nRAKUB and from RAKUB to the NGOs; and\n(iii)  for the training component, terms and conditions for using the identified farmer\ntraining facilities will have been finalized between DAE and the facility operators.\nVII.

Policy dialogue during the Project\u2019s preparation centered on three areas of particular\nrelevance  to  the  Project:  (i)  microfinance,  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  rural\ninfrastructure, and (iii) agricultural inputs. Of the first two, satisfactory agreements were reached\non improvement of farmer access to production credit through nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs) and to planning for O&M of market infrastructure to be developed under the Project.\nThis appendix provides details on the unresolved issues and the steps agreed to be taken in\nregard to agricultural input policies.\nA. Fertilizer Pricing and Marketing\n2. During project preparation, the Government clarified that the appointment of fertilizer\ndealerships for specific geographic areas was undertaken in response to a crisis situation that\ndeveloped  in  1994-1995  after  the  completion  of  the  policy  measures  on  the  Foodcrops\nDevelopment Program (FDP).1 One of the FDP measures was to allow any private individual to\npurchase urea in bulk directly from Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) fertilizer\nfactories. According to the Government, a cartel bought up large volumes of urea and was\ncontrolling  the  market  and  the  retail  price.  To  exacerbate  the  situation,  world  urea  prices\nreached very high levels in 1994-1995 and large amounts of urea were exported to take\nadvantage of these prices. This led to severe shortages within the country and especially in\nsome of the more isolated regions, and turned into a major political and economic crisis. The\nGovernment clarified that the present fertilizer marketing system has evolved in consultation\nwith the private fertilizer dealers association and no urea shortage has since been reported from\nany part of the country. At the same time, the Government recognized that this matter was of\nconcern to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other external agencies.\n3. The situation pertaining to the urea subsidy is more complex than that of distribution.\nProviding inputs for agricultural production at subsidized prices is a stated policy of the current\nparty in power. Also, analysis of the financial subsidy on urea is difficult since most of the urea\nused in the country is produced in Government-owned factories, which set their own pricing. It is\nalso difficult to determine exactly what the financial subsidy is, due to the differential pricing in the\ncountry for natural gas the main raw material for urea production. The Government acknowledged\nthat imported urea is being subsidized to bring prices into line with local BCIC prices, but noted\nthat imported urea accounted for only 5-10 percent of the national consumption. Moreover, it felt\nthat to bring BCIC prices in line with world market prices was not necessarily desirable since\nthese prices tend to fluctuate unpredictably.\n4. The  Government  also  noted  that  Bangladesh  is  a  member  of  the  World  Trade\nOrganization  (WTO)  and  a  signatory  to  its  agreements.  WTO  rules  allow  agriculture  sector\nsubsidies of up to 10 percent of the production value of the sector. In Bangladesh, agriculture\nsector subsidies currently amount to less than 3 percent of the sector\u2019s total production value and,\nthus, are viewed as being compliant with WTO agreements.\n5. Given  the  economic  and  political  importance  of  urea  in  the  agricultural  economy  of\nBangladesh, resolution of these issues will require persistent effort on the part of ADB and other\nagencies. Nonetheless, the Government agreed during the Project\u2019s preparation to reexamine the\nwhole question of fertilizer dealerships and consider any changes that may be required to improve\nthe efficiency of fertilizer supply to farmers.\n                  \n1 PPA: BAN 22217: Food Crops Development Program, December 1999.", "44 Appendix 3, page 2\nB. Seed Marketing\n6. On the question of seed, the Government has, in contradiction to the provisions of the\nFDP,  retained  a  role  in  retailing  crop  seed  through  Bangladesh  Agriculture  Development\nCorporation (BADC). The Government\u2019s view is that, given the slow development of private seed\nproduction and trade, this measure is essential to ensure a secure seed supply in isolated regions\nof the country. The Government explained that it was, however, willing to review the need for\nthese retail sales in the project area in the light of the construction of the Jamuna bridge, which\nhas alleviated the isolation of a large part of the country. On the seed notification process, it was\nclarified that except for the five notified seeds (rice, wheat, sugar, jute, and potato), all import,\nproduction, and marketing of seeds was open. On notified seeds, the approved varieties were\nopen but imports of new varieties required permission, testing and verification, for which a system\nhas been put in place. In the context of the crops to be promoted under the Project, seed\nnotification is of concern only for potato. Overall, BADC\u2019s role in the domestic seed market is\nminor, comprising only an estimated 6.5 percent of the total trade.2\nC. Specific Agreed Actions\n7. Other funding agencies in the sector have had extensive discussions with the Government\non these matters over the past few years.  Some progress on the issues could be expected, but\nthe question of urea subsidy was unlikely to be resolved in the near future, due as much to the\ncomplexity and uncertainty about the size and nature of the subsidy as anything else. ADB action\non these policy issues will need to be closely coordinated with other agencies. The World Bank\nhas  ongoing  discussions  on  all  of  the  issues  with  the  Government  under  a  policy-based\nagriculture and rural development program loan that is likely to be processed by the third quarter\nof 2001. Seed and fertilizer production and marketing policies have been specifically flagged\nunder this loan, which will be prepared in consultation with ADB.\n8. With regard to specific actions on the fertilizer and seed issues, as a result of discussions\nduring appraisal, the Government has agreed to (i) complete a full review of the existing BADC\nretail seed outlets by 30 June 2001 and inform ADB of the outcome and a timetable for further\naction;  (ii)  have  an  independent  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  fertilizer  distribution\nsystem completed by 30 June 2001 and inform ADB of the outcome and actions planned to be\ntaken; and (iii) review the mechanism for seed import, testing, and approval in order to identify\ninefficiencies and suggest  streamlined  procedures  that  will  encourage  greater  private  sector\nparticipation and improve flow of new seed varieties into the country.\n                  \n2 PPA: BAN 22217: Food Crops Development Program, December 1999.", "45 Appendix 4, page 1\nPARTICIPATING FINANCE AGENCIES\n1. Under  the  Project  credit  will  be  provided  to  small-scale  farmers  from  four  large\nestablished nongovernment organizations (NGOs), all of which are currently working with the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) (under similar arrangements as proposed for the Project), to\nhelp implement the Participatory Livestock Development Project in the same Project area.\nFunds for the NGOs will be channeled from Bangladesh Bank through the Rajshahi Krishi\nUnnayan Bank (RAKUB), a specialized agricultural development bank servicing the northwest\nregion. Pertinent information on the NGOs, Bangladesh Bank, and RAKUB is provided in this\nappendix.\nA.  The Credit Channeling Agencies\n1.  Bangladesh Bank\n2. The Bangladesh Bank is the apex of the country\u2019s financial system and serves as its\ncentral  bank.  It  is  the  authority  primarily  responsible  for  monetary  management  and  for\nestablishing relevant rules and issuing related directives to financial institutions. These mainly\nrelate  to  licensing,  interest  rates,  liquidity,  loan  classification,  credit  and  capital  adequacy.\nBangladesh  Bank  also  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  planning  and  execution  of  credit\nprograms  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  declared  agricultural  credit  policy  and  priorities.\nThrough the specialized agricultural development banks, the Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB) and\nRAKUB,  Bangladesh  Bank  provides  a  refinance  facility  at  preferential  interest  rates  to\nencourage the disbursement of credit to the agriculture sector.\n3. Two of Bangladesh Bank\u2019s departments are active in agricultural credit. The Agricultural\nCredit  Project  Department  is  responsible  for  implementing,  monitoring,  and  supervising\nagriculture sector projects financed with foreign credit and grant assistance. The Agriculture\nCredit  Department  is  responsible  for  agriculture  policy  issues  and  conducts  performance\nassessments of private and nationalized commercial banks\u2019 agricultural lending activities as well\nas those of the specialized agricultural development banks. Bangladesh Bank has its head\noffice and two branch offices in Dhaka, and seven other branch offices, in Barisal, Bogra,\nChittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. The bank had 6,178 staff at the end of the\nFY1999.\n4. Bangladesh Bank used to act mainly as a conduit for channeling funds to the banking\nsystem; however, subsequently it adopted a more proactive role in project implementation. The\nbank was to have been the executing agency for ADB\u2019s Agricultural and Rural Credit Project,\nand, as such, would have been responsible for implementation of policy reforms in the financial\nand  agricultural  credit  sectors.  However,  the  Project  was  not  implemented  due  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s  failure  to  meet  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness.  Currently,  among  project\nactivities, Bangladesh Bank supervises the activities of other banks that are providing credit for,\ninter alia: semi-intensive shrimp cultivation and shrimp culture development, establishment of\ncottage industries and agri-businesses in the private sector; programs for supporting banana\nplantations, salt mills, and rural transport; and cyclone relief.\n5. Bangladesh Bank is familiar with the requirements for implementing externally assisted\nprojects. It has been the executing agency for several ADB-financed projects, including the\nSecond  Aquaculture  Development  Project  and  the  North-West  Rural  Development  Project.\nThese projects commenced in the 1980s and have subsequently closed although recovery of", "46 Appendix 4, page 2\ncredit to subprojects financed by these loans continues under the direction of the Bangladesh\nBank.\n6. More  recent  projects  executed  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank  include  the  ADB-financed\nNortheast  Minor  Irrigation  Project  and  the  Marginal  and  Small  Farms  System  Crop\nIntensification Project in the Kurigram District of the northwest region. The first project, approved\nin 1991, provides a credit facility for private equipment dealers to finance small-scale irrigation\nequipment. The second, which commenced operations in 1987, is financed by the International\nFund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  with  the  German  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ).\nFunds are channeled through participating financial institutions, including RAKUB, to increase\nagricultural production and develop financial status of marginal and small-scale farmers.\n2.  Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank (RAKUB)\n7. RAKUB was established under the President\u2019s Ordinance No. LVIII of 1986. It began\noperations in 1987, when it was split off from the Bangladesh Krishi Bank and took over its\noperations and assets that were within the Rajshahi administrative division of the northwest\nregion of the country.\n8. RAKUB\u2019s head office is in the city of Rajshahi, which is about 280 kilometers northwest\nof Dhaka. RAKUB manages an extensive network of 300 branches in the northwest region as\nwell as one liaison and deposit-taking branch office in Dhaka. RAKUB plans to open 30 more\nbranches in the northwest region in the near future. Activities of the branches are supervised\nand controlled by 18 field-level offices that undertake internal audit functions of the smaller\nbranch offices. RAKUB has 3,736, staff of whom 1,674 are professional staff officers. RAKUB\nbranches  offer  a  range  of  commercial  banking  services  including  acceptance  of  deposits,\nremittance of funds, and foreign exchange dealings.\n9. RAKUB\u2019s lending is specialized for agricultural purposes, with 60 percent of its loans\nportfolio in crop lending. Fisheries, livestock, irrigation, and farm machinery are also important\nlending  activities.  RAKUB  has  a  small  program  of  financing  collateral-free  microcredit  for\nemployment generation and poverty alleviation in conjunction with Rajshahi/Dingajpur Rural\nServices in the Kurigram District. It has also recently embarked on promotion of agro-based\nindustries for the preservation, processing, and marketing of primary production. RAKUB has\nprovided loans for cold storage, packaging, and transport for distribution of produce as well as\nfor poultry, dairy, fertilizer blending, and engineering workshop projects.\n10. Though faced with severe financial problems nearly since its creation, the financial\nperformance  of  RAKUB  has  improved  significantly  since  a  change  in  management  and\nreplacement  of  some  board  directors  in  mid-1999.  After  7  years  of  losses  and  an  ever-\nincreasing portfolio of bad debts, the financial statements for fiscal year June 2000 although as\nyet unaudited, show a small profit and an improvement in the number and amount of classified\nloans.\n11. To address its lack of a performing loans, RAKUB management set a target to increase\nlending by 20 percent per annum over a five-year reform period and to increase the number of\nnew borrowers by 20 percent. The aim was also to diversify the loan portfolio with targets for\nincreased lending to priority sectors other than crop production. RAKUB achieved this target\nduring the first year it was set and, despite a shortfall in some of the selected priority sectors, its\nperformance was significantly better than in the previous year. This will ultimately lead to greater\ndiversification of the loans portfolio.", "47 Appendix 4, page 3\n12. In an attempt to recover the Tk8.4 billion of the nonperforming loans on its books,\nRAKUB set a target of 20 percent recovery per annum and embarked on a loan collection\nincentive program known by the acronym, \u201cMIRACLE\u201d which stands for \u201cmaximum recovery of a\nclassified loan entirely.\u201d One of the main features of the program is that any RAKUB employee\nis eligible to participate in the recovery of classified loans. An employee who is instrumental in\nthe closure of a classified loan and the recovery of all outstanding principal and interest on the\nloan, receives 10 percent of the realized interest. In the first year of the program, a target of\nTk1.68 billion was set for recovery and of this target Tk1.07 billion was achieved. While this is\nonly 64 percent of the target set, it is more than four times the previous year\u2019s collection\nperformance when only Tk0.25 billion worth of classified loans were recovered.\n13. As at the end of FY1998, RAKUB was indebted to the Bangladesh Bank by Tk10.4\nbillion. This came about through the previous management\u2019s practice of financing much of\nRAKUB\u2019s  operations  and  disbursements  out  of  funds  received  from  the  Bangladesh  Bank\nrefinance facility. This unsustainable practice has been discontinued under the reform program.\nIn the first year of the program, RAKUB did not draw any funds from the Bangladesh Bank\nrefinance facility and repaid Tk32.6 million of its outstanding debt. This compares favorably with\nprevious years when the debt to the Bangladesh Bank continued to grow with funds drawn\ngreatly exceeding repayments. RAKUB set a target of 10 percent net increase of deposits per\nannum. This was to be achieved through measures including the promotion of small saving and\nteacher\u2019s saving schemes. The first year\u2019s target deposit increase was Tk1.1 billion against\nwhich Tk1.03 billion was achieved. This is a 94 percent achievement and compares to a\nrelatively small increase in the previous year of only Tk0.17 billion. The deposit balance at the\nend of FY1999 was Tk5.05 billion compared to Tk3.67 billion FY1998.\n14. Finally, steps have been taken during RAKUB\u2019s first year of a reform program to initiate\nimprovements  in  conditions,  staff  management,  and  training.  These  include  an  attempt  to\nexpedite  the  resolution  of  personnel  matters  including  the  timely  preparation  of  annual\nperformance assessments, delegation of personnel functions to the branches, preparation of\nnew job descriptions, and implementation of a new training and career development program.\nB. The Nongovernment Organizations\n1.  Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)\n15. BRAC is the country\u2019s largest NGO. It was founded in 1972 as a relief agency and has\nevolved in to a large, multifaceted development organization with the objectives of \u201cpoverty\nreduction and empowerment of the poor.\u201d\n16. With a membership of 3.3 million households in all 64 of the country\u2019s districts in 1999,\nan annual budget of $131 million, and a full-time staff of 24,700, BRAC truly is a national\ninstitution.\n17. BRAC\u2019s  ongoing  activities  cover  several  programs  including  a  rural  development\nprogram  (aimed  primarily  at  the  landless  and  particularly  landless  women),  an  education\nprogram, a health and nutrition program, an agriculture program, a microenterprise lending and\nassistance program, and an urban poor program. It operates primarily through group formation\nand mobilization for training and for the provision of microcredit to finance productive activities.\nBy the end of 1999, its cumulative disbursement of credit (from 1979) amounted to $965 million", "48 Appendix 4, page 4\nand in 1999 alone it disbursed $219 million, of which $141 million is still outstanding. The\nhistorical repayment rate is 98 percent. Members groups savings are $58 million, and the\nlending rate for credit is 15 percent.\n18. Of particular interest to the Project is BRAC\u2019s agriculture program. This program consists\nof the long-running vegetable program, which has been expanded to include assistance in\ngrowing rice, wheat and maize; the social forestry program; the vegetable export program; the\nseed production and marketing program; and the tissue culture laboratory. This program trains\nagriculture  extension  workers  (many  of  whom  are  women)  to  assist  village  organization\nmembers and small-scale farmers by providing training and technical assistance, and supplying\ninputs such as high quality seed and disease free seedlings. In 1999, this program employed\n8,525 village extension workers who assisted 111,160 village organization members and 50,757\nsmall-scale  farmers  to  grow  vegetables,  rice,  maize,  and  wheat.  Moreover,  BRAC\u2019s  seed\nproduction program distributed 99 tons of 22 different kinds of vegetable seed, 100,000 potato\nmicrotubers, and 500,000 banana plantlets. Contract growers also supplied potatoes, chillies,\nand a range of vegetable crops for export to Singapore and Europe.\n19. In the past few years, BRAC\u2019s management has made a policy decision to begin to\ntarget not only the landless and marginal segments of society, but also the poor small-scale\nfarmer, in the realization that this segment of society (to date neglected in terms of credit\nprovision) will provide much of the economic growth in the rural areas.\n20. BRAC is well-represented in the project area, with active programs in every district and\ntraining facilities in Dinajpur.\n2.  PROSHIKA Manavik Kendra\n21. PROSHIKA is the country\u2019s second largest NGO. Established in 1976 PROSHIKA has a\nsimilar mandate to BRAC but in practice has a somewhat narrower focus on the landless and\nmarginal landholding groups. It also has a focus on group formation and mobilization and its\nmembership  comprises  51,713  women\u2019s  groups  and  35,947  men\u2019s  groups  with  a  total\nhousehold membership of about 1.7 million (or about 7 million beneficiaries). PROSHIKA is\nactive in 50 of the country\u2019s 64 districts (including all of the project area), has a total staff of over\n4,000, almost all of whom are field staff, and an annual budget of close to $100 million. In 1998,\nPROSHIKA  disbursed  $56  million  in  credit  to  33,000  of  its  member  households  and  has\ncumulatively (since inception) disbursed $189 million. In comparison with BRAC, PROSHIKA\nhas a lower emphasis on microcredit provision and a greater emphasis on group formation and\neducation and training.\n22. PROSHIKA  has  a  wide  range  of  programs.  These  include  a  universal  education\nprogram, an employment and income generating program, an environmental protection and\nregeneration program, a health and education program, an urban poor program, and a disaster\nmanagement  program.  Of  importance  for  the  Project  are  the  employment  and  income\ngeneration program and the environmental protection and regeneration program, which include\nactivities  such  as  irrigation,  livestock  development,  fisheries  development,  sericulture,\napiculture, and ecological agriculture. The ecological agriculture component includes ecological\ncropping based on farming without chemical fertilizer and pesticides, and homestead gardening.\nTo date, 537,000 farmers have been trained in ecologically sound cropping practices and these\npractices have been successfully implemented on about 50,000 hectares (ha) of crop land.\nMoreover,  through  homestead  gardening  training,  about  62,000  members  were  trained  in\nvegetable and fruit production in 1998-1999 alone. PROSHIKA also has a seed production and", "49 Appendix 4, page 5\nmarketing program for vegetable seed. Like BRAC, PROSHIKA is well-represented in every\ndistrict of the project area.\n3.  Grameen Krishi Foundation (GKF)\n23. The GKF is an offshoot of the Grameen Bank, set up in 1991 to take over privatized\ntubewells from the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Board and the Bangladesh Water\nDevelopment  Board  and  run  them  as  cooperative  farms  owned  by  landless  and  marginal\nfarmers. GKF is very much agriculture oriented in its outlook and includes among its objectives\nthe following: \u201c(i) to increase income and employment within the rural sector for men and\nwomen; (ii) to enable the poor to gain equitable access to the use of irrigation and other\nagricultural equipment for productive purposes; (iii) to enhance crop diversification for effective\nutilization of under-utilized fallow land; (iv) to promote private sector seed production at farm\nlevel; (v) to provide credit for crop production and for both on-farm and off-farm activities for\nlandless, marginal and small farmers; (vi) to promote marketing of mostly non-traditional and\nalso traditional crops at home and abroad.\u201d\n24. Unlike  BRAC  and  PROSHIKA,  GKF  covers  only  a  limited  target  area:  14  districts,\nincluding part of the project area. Within this area, GKF has 18,000 groups comprising 90,000\nmembers and who cultivate about 50,000 ha either individually or collectively. Of these 90,000\nmembers, 85,000 currently have loans. GKF has disbursed about $10 million in loans with a\n99.5 percent recovery rate. Group fund savings total just over $1.1 million. GKF\u2019s program is run\nby a staff of about 1,200 with an annual budget in 1999 of about $436,000.\n25. GKF\u2019s  field  program  is  crop  production  oriented  although  it  does  include  livestock\ndevelopment. One of the most relevant aspects of the agency\u2019s work, with regard to the Project,\nis an emphasis on crop diversification. Of the approximately 50,000 ha in production under\nGKF\u2019s guidance, about 13,000 ha was in non-rice crops, primarily, vegetables, potatoes, and\nfruits. GKF is also active in the promotion and production of improved seed for a range of\nvegetables, fruit, and hybrid maize.\n4.  Rangpur/Dinajpur Rural Services (RDRS)\n26. RDRS  was  set  up  in  1971  by  the  Lutheran  World  Fellowship.  In  1976,  a  sectoral\ndevelopment program was devised to assist the \u201cpoorest of the poor\u201d in agriculture, community\ndevelopment, health, and women\u2019s economic activities while at the same time continuing a\nconstruction program for roads, bridges, markets, and schools. In 1988, RDRS divided its\nactivities into a Rural Works Project (concentrating on infrastructure) and a Comprehensive\nProject with a stress on social, educational, and economic factors. RDRS still has strong ties\nwith its original international NGO founders and depends to a large extent on bilateral and\ninternational NGO funding for its programs. It is currently involved in 31 bilaterally funded\nprojects with donors ranging from the Republic of Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany\nto the World Food Program and Japan. Its current program amounts to about $38 million, which\nis substantial given the limited area of operation (29 subdistricts).\n27. RDRS  works  through  groups  of  representatives  of  poor  households,  which  receive\nawareness training, skills training, and credit distribution for income generating activities. RDRS\nhas about 280,000 group members. In 1999, about $67 million was disbursed to about 110,000\nborrowers, including about 2,000 small-scale farmers. (Notably, about 3,400 participants in\nADB\u2019s Participatory Livestock Development Project received microfinance from RDRS in 1999).\nHistorically, the repayment rate for microcredit loans has been about 92 percent.", "50 Appendix 4, page 6\n28. RDRS has a range of programs from education to health and disaster preparedness,\nand is active in agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Of particular relevance to the Project is an\nIFAD-financed project in Kurigram and Thakurgaon districts which is expanding the basic RDRS\ngroup  work  to  small-scale  farmers,  focusing  on  farms  of  0.5-1.2  ha.  RDRS\u2019s  publications\nacknowledge the need to work with farmers in this landholding group and the institution intends\nto expand work with its small-scale farmer groups.", "51 Appendix 5, page 1\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\nTable A4.1: Project Cost Estimates\n($'000)\nForeign  Local \nComponent Exchange Currency Total Cost\nA.

Rural  women  play  an  important  role  in  agriculture  production  and  food  security  in\nBangladesh. Women from small-scale farm families in the project area work on the family farms\nin different agriculture activities. Their work in the agriculture field covers all activities from seed\nto harvest.  Women are also managing grain storage and processing and fruit and vegetable\nproduction, especially in and around their homesteads.  In some nongovernment organization\n(NGO)  programs  in  the  project  area,  women  participate  in  seed,  sunflower,  and  maize\nproduction.  Given  that  women  are  significantly  involved  in  crop  production,  the  Project  is\ndesigned with specific mechanisms and features to facilitate and ensure full participation of\nwomen in the Project.\n2. Prior to the commencement of project activities, the gender specialist, in coordination\nwith the NGOs, will develop and supervise a gender assessment in the project area, focusing\nespecially on the high value crops selected for promotion under the Project. This assessment\nwill gather first hand information on gender division in production activities relevant to the\nProject. Field observations and interviews will be conducted with both men and women farmers.\n3. Based on the outcome of this assessment, a gender strategy will be prepared for the\nmobilization and group formation of farmers, both men and women. The number of mixed or\nseparate groups will be determined based on the findings of the gender assessment. The\ngender strategy will also determine the type of extension training to be provided to the women.\n4. In  the  village-based  training  to  be  provided  under  the  Project,  the  Department  of\nAgriculture Extension and the NGOs will ensure that women farmers working in the project area\nare adequately targeted and represented.\n5.  The Project includes a gender consultant to be placed in the project management unit to\ndesign  and  undertake  the  initial  gender  assessment  in  the  Project  area,  and  design  the\nimplementation strategy and the monitorable indicators for ensuring women\u2019s full participation in\nproject activities.\n6. The village-based training and extension services will be specifically designed to meet\nthe needs of the women farmers.", "65 Appendix 12, page 1\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\nA.  Economic Rationale\n1. The Northwest Crop Diversification Project is justifiable on the following grounds:\n(i)  Equity. The northwest region remains one of the poorest regions in the country.\n(ii)  Market Failure. Public services: varietal information, production technology, and\naccess to credit are lacking for small-scale farmers. The Project will focus on\nsuch farmers as they have the land resources needed to raise high value crops\n(HVCs) but are not served by the existing microcredit and formal credit programs.\nThe marketing support component will increase competition, increase marketing\nopportunities, reduce postharvest losses, and increase farmers\u2019 knowledge of\nproduce prices.\n(iii)  Complementary  Externalities.  (nonquantifiable)  The  Project  will  enhance  the\nimpact of other ADB projects in the region, e.g., the Jamuna Bridge Project, Third\nRural Infrastructure Development Project, Horticulture Development Project, and\nParticipatory Livestock Development Project.\n(iv)  Other  Effects.  (nonquantifiable)  The  Project  will  also  benefit  the  region\u2019s\neconomy  as  a  whole  due  to  increased  labor  demand  and  overall  regional\nnutritional  status  as  new  and  more  nutritious  vegetables  and  fruits  become\navailable at accessible prices.\nB.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries\n2. The main quantifiable benefits arising from the Project are increased HVC production by\nfarmers who are expected to undergo training and take production loans. Other economic\nbenefits  accruing  from  the  Project  but  that  are  not  quantified  include  reduced  losses  and\nmarketing costs through improvements to growers\u2019 markets, reduced costs of marketing and\nhigher produce values at village markets, and increased production from farmers who do not\nparticipate in the project but adopt HVC production. Most of people who take loans and benefit\nfrom higher crop production will be small-scale farming households with holdings of 0.2 to 1.2\nhectares (ha).  Approximately 160,000 small-scale farm households are expected to directly\nbenefit from crop diversification, training, extension, and credit under the Project. It is difficult to\nprecisely quantify the number of the households who will benefit from the renovation and\nupgrading of primary and growers\u2019 markets, although these will include much of the general\npopulation living near these facilities.\n3. Seven years after project implementation, the Project\u2019s field activities will give rise to\nproduction of approximately 370,000 tons of HVC per annum which, after deducting the value of\nrice taken out of production, will have an incremental value estimated at $27.9 million. At the\nend  of  the  Project,  the  field  activities  will  generate  an  additional  4.4  million  labor-days  of\nemployment per annum.", "66 Appendix 12, page 2\nC.  Sector Policy Context\n4. The  Government  agricultural  policy  on  some  issues  has  been  reversed  from  the\nagreements for the Food Crops Sector Program (FCP), especially those related to fertilizer\nsubsidy, publicly controlled marketing of fertilizer and public sector seed production. These\nissues will have to be addressed in coordination with other agencies such as World Bank, but\nthe outcome will affect the economic viability of the Project only marginally at best (See paras.\n43-47 in the main text).\n5. On rural finance, the Agricultural Credit Department of Bangladesh Bank has confirmed\nthat there is no interest rate ceiling or restriction of eligibility to agricultural credit in terms of farm\nsize. Previously imposed restrictions of this nature have been removed, and the interest rate\nceiling was removed in July 1999. Currently, the Bangladesh Bank only issues yearly guidelines\nthat list indicative credit size per hectare depending on crop category, farm size, and farm input\nrequirements.\nD. Comparative Advantage\n6. The  northwest  region  has  large  tracts  of  flood-free  highlands  with  desired  agro-\necological zones and good, deep, free-draining lighter textured soils ideally suited to HVCs.\nSixty target subdistricts have been selected based on factors including altitude, soil condition,\navailability  of  irrigation  water,  farm  size  (land  holdings),  access  for  marketing  and  input\nprocurement, and current land use.\n7. For vegetables and spices, while some of the districts (Bogra, Pabna, and parts of\nRangpur) in the northwest have started growing these crops, the greater districts of Dinajpur\nand Rajshahi and more northern parts of Rangpur offer good opportunities for diversification.\nThe major opportunity gap is in summer vegetable production in which the drier and cooler\nareas of the far north of the northwest region can excel. Also, the northwest should be able to\nproduce  earlier  crops  of  cool  season  vegetables.  A  recent  study1  shows  that  potatoes,\nvegetables, chillis, and onions provide high financial returns and have a comparative advantage.\nThese and other crops are being focused on under the Project.\n8. Hybrid maize is considered very promising as a substitute for imports used in livestock\nfeed,  and  has  significant  potential  to  increase  farm  incomes.  The  ongoing  Participatory\nLivestock Development Project (started in early 1998) is expected to support more than 400,000\nsmall households raising poultry and cattle in the northwest and north-central regions. This will\ncreate a significant surge in demand for the animal feed. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs)\nsuch as Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) operate their own processing\nfacilities for hybrid maize to support livestock enterprises.\n9. In addition, fruits with good potential for commercial production in the northwest region\ninclude  banana,  coconut,  guava,  lemon,  lime,  lychee,  mandarin,  mango,  orange,  papaya,\npineapple, sapodilla, sweet tamarind, and sour tamarind. All of these fruits have a comparative\nadvantage for production in the highland, flood-free areas of the northwest. Technical and\nsocioeconomic constraints can be overcome by the project (based on available information in\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO, TA Report).\n                                                          \n1 Shahabuddin. 1999. Comparative Advantage in Bangladesh Agriculture.", "67 Appendix 12, page 3\nE. Project Design Features\n1.  Realistic Packaging\n10. Agricultural processing and agribusiness was originally considered as one of the Project\ncomponents but has been scaled down to the level of a pilot activity.  A small line of credit will\nbe extended through Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank (RAKUB) to agribusiness projects that\ncomply  with  strict  eligibility  criteria.  This  will  test  the  feasibility  and  viability  of  some\nrepresentative  enterprises  and  test  the  implementation  and  institutional  arrangements  for\nagribusiness lending.\n2.  Marketing Management\n11. Previous  projects  in  Bangladesh  with  a  marketing  component  have  tended  to\nconcentrate  on  the  physical  improvement  of  market  infrastructure  without  due  attention  to\nmanagement  aspects.  This  approach  has  limited  the  benefits  to  growers.  The  Project  will\nsupport  strengthening  of  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  in  collecting,  collating,  and\ndisseminating timely and accurate information on markets and prices. It will also develop and\nimplement improved market management systems.\n3.  Strategic Beneficiary Targeting for Optimum Poverty Impact\n12. The beneficiary target for the Project (farmers with landholdings of 0.2-1.2 ha) has taken\ninto  consideration  the  specific  rural  poverty  situation  in  Bangladesh.  The  rural  poor  in\nBangladesh fall into three distinct bands taking into consideration the key indicators of per\ncapita income, land ownership, and food deficit status:2 (i) extreme poor (about 23 percent of\nrural poor); (ii) moderate poor (about 29 percent), (iii) tomorrow\u2019s poor (about 21 percent). Thirty\nto forty percent of the third category, with land ownership of up to 0.6 ha, are said to be above\nthe income poverty line. But this group is vulnerable to income erosion pressures and in danger\nof descending into poverty as was the case for a sizable percentage of these households during\n1987-1994.  A  group  of  households  immediately  above  this  layer  (0.6-1.2  ha)  is  equally\nvulnerable. Only those who move upward from this category move away from danger of falling\nbelow the poverty line. The Project will therefore target this layer of the poor (0.2-1.2 ha), of\nwhich 60-70 percent are below the income poverty line or in danger of falling below it. This\ngroup has not been served by NGO microcredit or by formal credit. More importantly, from the\nregional development perspective, this group is the entrepreneurial segment of the poor who will\nbe able to contribute to internally driven sustained regional economic growth once they have a\ngreater sense of security brought about by technical knowledge transfer. They are not averse to\ncommercial development of HVCs, as has been shown in some regions in the northwest.\nMarketing is the major missing link to realize their entrepreneurship and requires the type of\nsupport provided by the Project.\nF. Demand Analysis\n1.  Demand for HVCs\n13. Bangladesh is a large net importer of agricultural produce. 1997 trade statistics 1997\nshow  imports  of  HVCs  and  derived  processed  produce  at  about  $50  million.  Substantial\n                                                          \n2 Rahman, H.Z. 1995. Dynamics of Rural Poverty in Bangladesh (and interview in person).", "68 Appendix 12, page 4\nquantities of HVCs and seeds, including less perishable items such as potatoes and spices,\nenter from India to the northwest region and other parts of Bangladesh, indicating significant\nroom for import substitution in the domestic markets. The economy has experienced an annual\ngrowth rate of 4-5 percent in recent years.  According to World Bank studies,3 most HVCs have\ndemand elasticities well above those for food grains and higher than for pulses and oils. Based\non demand elasticity, population, and income growth from the studies, the countrywide demand\nfor HVCs is projected to rise from the current 4.0-5.0 million tons per annum to 5.4-6.5 million\ntons  in  2007.  Using  the  same  parameters,  the  HVC  demand  in  the  northwest  region  will\nincrease from the current 1.9 million to 2.5 million tons.\n14. HVC production from the Project would build up gradually and is estimated at 370,000\ntons at full development in 2008, which would account for only about 6 percent of the projected\nnational total demand and about 15 percent of the expected total demand in the northwest\nregion. Currently most HVCs such as fruits, vegetables, and spices are consumed in and close\nto the production areas. While future market and price developments would determine the HVC\ncropping pattern, considering the small share of the incremental production from the Project in\nthe expected total demand, it is highly unlikely that the Project would upset long-term price\ntrends.  Much  of  the  incremental  production  from  the  Project  is  therefore  expected  to  be\nabsorbed within the region. The extent of reduction in transaction costs associated with Jamuna\nbridge and other marketing network developments that link the produce from the northwest\nregion to Dhaka and Chittigong urban areas has yet to unfold. Although such interregional\nmarketing will be a further benefit from the Project, for the time being it suffices to consider the\ndemand within the northwest region.\n2.  Demand for Credit\n15. Farmers\u2019 credit requirements are based on the crop budgets and farm models (paras.\n14-21).  Each  participating  household  on  average  could  increase  HVC  production  by  0.25\nhectares, on which representative HVCs are to be grown. The average production costs per\n0.25 hectares are estimated at $102 (excluding family-owned labor costs), and this amount is\ntaken  as  the  household  credit  requirement.  The  credit  disbursement  schedule  is  to  be\nsynchronized with the farmers. As such, the credit demand flow by year is projected in Table\nA11.1, with the aggregate amount of $22.6 million, inclusive of price contingencies.\nTable A11.1:  Credit Requirements\nItem Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 Y6 Y7 Total\nNo. of Farmers 0 16,000 32,000 40,000 32,000 24,000 16,000 160,000\nTaking Credit\nCredit Required 0 1,854 4,023 5,448 4,714 3,818 2,745 22,601\n($\u2019000)\nSource: Mission estimates.\nG. Financial Analysis\n16. Illustrative crop budgets have been formulated to assess the profitability of individual\ncrops. Project cost and benefit estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and are well\nbelow potential under ideal conditions using recommended technical packages.\n                                                          \n3 World Bank. 1995. Agriculture Growth with Diversification: Prospects and Issues. Washington, D.C.", "69 Appendix 12, page 5\n17. Subproject financial viability was estimated based on a yearly production cycle with\nrecurrent incremental costs and revenues, and no major capital investments. Local values are\nconverted into foreign exchange equivalent at an exchange rate of Tk51/$1. Labor costs are\nbased on the basic daily wage rate of Tk50 per day. For traded commodities, economic prices\nhave been estimated based on the World Bank's commodity price forecasts, projected to 2005\nin constant terms (Year 2000=1.0), with adjustments for local handling and transport costs.\n18. Farm model analysis was carried out to project incremental farm incomes and return to\nfamily labor on a selection of subprojects to be supported under the Project.  As it is difficult to\naccurately  predict,  the  composition  of  HVCs  that  the  participating  farmers  will  adopt,  six\nindicative farm models were evaluated. The analysis was carried out for farms of 1 ha and 0.5\nha size diversifying into HVCs and increasing cropping intensities from 180 percent without the\nProject to 200 percent with the Project. The HVCs are hybrid maize, hybrid potato, and mixed\nvegetable-spices cropping.\n19. Hybrid maize was selected as its demand is expected to increase with an increased\ndemand for livestock feed. Hybrid potatoes are already an important crop in the area and have a\ndemonstrated comparative advantage. Mixed vegetable-spices have been included to indicate\nthe average performance of the envisaged potential vegetable and spice crops that could be\nexpanded under the Project.  These include cabbage, chilli, onion, ginger, tumeric, string bean,\nradish, tomato, cucumber, and cauliflower.\n20. Farmers are expected to apply their own family labor on the farm which, on average, is\nequivalent to approximately 30 percent of the total subproject cost. For the balance of the\nsubproject cost (70 percent), loan financing for a period of six months with an average interest\nrate of 22 percent per annum, is assumed.\n21. Analysis of the farm models indicate that labor requirements would increase by about 12\npercent to 355 days on 1 ha farms and by about 11 percent to 177 days on 0.5 ha farms. The\nincreases appear to be well within the capacity of typical small farm households to meet, which\nhave an average labor availability of 450-550 days. Seasonal farm labor is available for hire in\nthe project area during the months when labor requirements exceed the available family labor.\n22. The results of the subproject financial analysis are summarized in Table A11.2.  As\nshown,  return  on  investment,  net  incomes,  and  returns  to  incremental  labor  applied  are\nprojected to be proportionately higher for farmers with the smaller (0.5 ha) land areas.  The\nassumption is that regardless of the farm size, diversification would take place on plot sizes of\n0.25 ha.  All farms would easily be able to service the debt incurred and provide a positive net\nfarm income after financing their respective subprojects.  After loan repayment, net incomes of\nfarmers on 0.5 ha landholdings who diversify into 0.25 ha of HVC increase by approximately\n$66 per annum (31 percent higher than those without the Project).  Net incomes of farmers with\n1 ha landholdings rise by approximately $91 per annum (21 percent higher than those without\nthe Project). The projected returns on investment and returns to additional labor applied are\nsatisfactory for all subprojects analyzed.  In particular, the calculation of incremental income for\neach additional day of labor applied with the Project shows a return well above the prevailing\ndaily wage rate for unskilled agricultural labor in all farm models.", "70 Appendix 12, page 6\nTable A11.2: Summary of Subproject Analysis\nSize of HVC Enterprise Return on Increase in Net Income per\nFarm Investment Farm Income Increased Labor-day\nMaize 48 percent $71 (16%) $2.53\n1 ha Potato 24 percent $95 (22%) $2.22\nVegetables/Spices 60 percent $106 (24%) $2.66\nAverage 39 percent $91 (21%) $2.47\nMaize 71 percent $46 (21%) $5.24\n0.5 ha Potato 26 percent $71 (33%) $2.97\nVegetables/Spices 83 percent $82 (38%) $3.93\nAverage 48 percent $66 (31%) $4.05\nHVC = high value crops.\nSource: mission estimates.\nH. Economic Analysis\n23. Estimation of project economic viability was based on the assumption of a project life of\n20 years, an investment period of 7 years, and an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent.\nFinancial prices of nontraded commodities have been converted to economic prices by using a\nstandard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.89. As there is a surplus of labor in the project area,\nshadow pricing of wage rates has been applied at 80 percent of the basic daily wage rate in the\nanalysis.\n24. Incremental economic benefits for each farm model were assessed using economic\nprices.  Tradable  inputs  and  outputs  were  based  on  import  or  export  parity  prices,  and\nnontradable components of inputs and outputs were adjusted using the standard conversion\nfactor  of  0.89.  Taxes,  duties,  and  contingencies  were  also  deducted.  The  results  were\naggregated based on expectations of the frequency of adoption of each type of diversification\nstrategy and the size distribution derived from the 1996 agricultural census.\n25. The overall project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 30.7 percent,\nindicating economic viability. This is based wholly on the quantifiable benefits derived from the\ncomponent for farmer mobilization and credit. The benefits of the noncredit components are\nlargely nonquantifiable and in some cases would apply to a wider range of project beneficiaries.\nNevertheless, a major portion of the economic costs of these components was added to the\nquantifiable costs and benefits of the credit component to arrive at the overall project EIRR.\nNoncredit costs wholly related to the Project, such as the costs of project management, were\nfully included in the analysis, while components with a wider range of beneficiaries are included\nat a level proportionate to their assumed contribution to the Project. In the case of the training\nand extension component, about 40 percent of the costs are for the formulation of training\ncourses and the production of training materials. Assuming half of this amount has a wider\napplication to other beneficiaries, only 80 percent of the total cost of this component is included\nin the analysis. Similarly, the cost of renovation and upgrading of primary and growers markets\nconstitutes 80 percent of the cost of the marketing support component. Again, assuming that\nhalf of this cost can be applied to the benefit of others external to the Project, only 60 percent of\nthe cost of this component is included.  The same applies to the adaptive research component,\nwhere 40 percent of the cost has a wider application so that only 80 percent of the component\ncost is included in the analysis. While there would presumably be net incremental benefits\nderived from the agribusiness credit component, given the pilot nature of this activity, there was\nno attempt to quantify these and the full cost of this component is included in the analysis.", "71 Appendix 12, page 7\nI. Sensitivity Analysis\n26. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of higher costs and a decline in\nbenefits on the Project. The results of the sensitivity analysis for the overall Project EIRR are\nshown in Table A11.3.  Due in part to the inclusion of the costs of the noncredit components,\nwhich constitute a major portion of the costs in the early years of project implementation, the\noverall project EIRR is sensitive to cost increases.  A 17.3 percent increase in costs would result\nin an EIRR below the 12 percent threshold opportunity cost of capital.  The Project is also\nsensitive to a decline in benefits with a 13.2 percent decline resulting in an EIRR below the\nthreshold level. In the unlikely event of a combination of a 10 percent cost overrun and a 10\npercent decline in benefits, the Project would become unviable. Delays in the realization of\nbenefits however, do not have much impact on the project viability.\nTable A11.3: Results of Sensitivity Analysis, EIRR (%)\nDetails EIRR (%) Switching Values\n(%)\nBase Case 30.7\n10% Cost Overrun 20.3 17.3\n10% Decline in Benefits  16.8 13.2\nCombination of Benefit         4.0\n   Decline and Cost Overrun\n1 year Delay in Benefits   26.5\n2 years Delay in Benefits   23.3\nSource:  Mission estimates.\nJ.  Financial Sustainability\n27. As  discussed  in  the  main  text  (paras.  108-110)  large  incremental  operation  and\nmaintenance costs (O&M) are not envisaged. The major recurrent expenditures after the project\ninvestments have been made will be on (i) O&M of the upgraded horticulture training and\ndemonstration centers (HTDCs) and (ii) O&M for the primary and growers\u2019 markets. The Project\nwill cover O&M during the implementation period and evolve methods of self-financing after the\nProject. Similarly, market management improvements will focus on O&M.\n28. In addition, sufficient government counterpart fund is expected to be allocated during the\nproject implementation period. According to the 1999-2000 Development Program, Tk3,780\nmillion ($74 million) has been allocated for the crop subsector for implementation of 78 projects\n(64 investment projects and 14 technical assistance projects) in FY2000. Out of this amount, for\nexample, Tk106 million ($2.1 million) is allocated to the ADB-assisted Horticulture Development\nProject (which closed in 1999) against the total project cost budgeted at Tk1,795 million or $36\nmillion. For the proposed Project, the average Government counterpart fund, net of beneficiaries\ncontribution, is estimated at about $1.5 million per annum (total $9.3 million). This is smaller\nthan the Government funding allocated to the above project and therefore considered well within\nan affordable range in the portfolio of its crop subsector development plan for the coming years."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090420161354+08'00'", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3190-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20090901150419+08'00'", "Title": ""}}
