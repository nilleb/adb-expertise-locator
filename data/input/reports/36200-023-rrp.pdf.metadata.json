The development of \nSMEs  is  seen  as  a  key  element  in  this  development  strategy,  as  noted  in  the  Government  of \nBangladesh\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan for fiscal year (FY) 2011\u2012FY2015.4 To achieve double-digit \neconomic growth as outlined by the government\u2019s Vision 2021 to attain middle-income status by \n2021,5 promoting the SME sector is considered critical. \n \n4. \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises\u2014overview and constraints. The SME sector in \nBangladesh  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  growth  of  the  country.  According  to  the  most  recent \neconomic  census  of  the  country  carried  out  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  during \nMarch\u2013May 2013, it is estimated that the SME sector comprises 7.2 million firms, which account \nfor 90% of all private enterprises in the country, or even 99% of all firms when micro enterprises \nare  included.6 SMEs  employ  about  70%\u201380%  of the  nonagricultural  workforce  and contributed \n25% of Bangladesh\u2019s gross domestic product and 40% of the manufacturing output in 2014.7  \n \n5. \nEnhanced SME activities in the rural and backward regions constitute a key component \nof  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for  rural  development,  and  reduction  of  poverty  and  regional \ndisparity,  since most firms  outside the metropolitan  areas  of  Bangladesh  are  SMEs.  However, \nthe major development challenge in Bangladesh is a sharp metropolitan\u2013nonmetropolitan divide \nin terms of employment and economic growth.8 \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  For the Bangladesh Industrial Policy 2010, see the Detailed Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Analysis \n\naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n3  Women SMEs are defined as being one of the following: (i) women are the owners or proprietors of a privately run \norganization, or own at least a 51% share in case of a joint-venture vehicle or a company listed with the Office of \nthe Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms; or (ii) at least 60% of the managerial staff are women. \n\n4  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2011.

Dhaka.  \n\nhttp://www.bbs.gov.bd/PageWebMenuContent.aspx?MenuKey=347 \n\n7   Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Finance  (Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Finance  and  Leasing  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8  As  per  the  provisional  figures  of  the  economic  census  conducted  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics, \n\n5.81 million enterprises were located in rural areas and 2.25 million enterprises in urban areas.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nA  survey  carried  out  by  the  Bangladesh  Integrated  Support  to  Poverty  and  Inequality \n6. \nReduction through Enterprise Development (INSPIRED) identified the following main constraints \non  SME  growth:  (i)  inadequate  access to finance,  especially  long-term funding; (ii) inadequate \nsupplies of utilities (mainly electricity) and infrastructure (especially poor transportation); and (iii) \nincreasing  costs  of  labor  and  lack  of  skilled  labor,  particularly  in  manufacturing. 9  These \nconstraints  are  also  reflected  in  the  2015  Doing  Business  Survey  of  the  World  Bank,  which \nranks Bangladesh 173rd out of 189 economies.10 \n \nThe  backward  and  forward  links  of  SMEs  to  the  formal  sector,  particularly  the  larger \n7. \nexport-driven  industries,  are  severely  underdeveloped  in  Bangladesh.  Backward  links  are \nessential to reduce the production cost of products to make them more competitive in both the \ndomestic and foreign markets. Forward links are also missing: SMEs in Bangladesh, especially \nsmall ones, do not have enough capital resources and know-how to market their products to a \nwider  market  base.  For  industries  to  succeed  in the  current globalized  economic  environment, \nforming horizontal and vertical links is crucial. This can be done by forming alliances, clustering, \nand networking among SMEs to compete effectively domestically and internationally. \n \n8. \nAccess  to  finance.  The  banking  sector  in  Bangladesh  continues  to  be  the  largest \nprovider  of  credit  to  the  SME  sector.  Bank  lending  to  SMEs  amounted  to  Tk834  billion  (about \n$10.7  billion)  or  97.8%  of  total  SME  loans  in  2013.  The  remaining  2.2%  came  from  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions.  The  banking  sector  has  been  burdened  by  high  levels  of  nonperforming \nloans, which were accumulated over many years primarily because of weak management of the \nstate-owned banks. Although the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans has declined from \n13.2%  in  March  2008  to  9.7%  at  the  end  of  December  2014,  it  is  still  high.11 Although  private \nsector  credit  among  banks  grew  by  13.6%  in  the  third  quarter  of  FY2015,  this  was  a  decline \nfrom FY2010 and FY2011, when banks expanded their credit portfolio by 24.2% and 25.8%. \n \n9. \nThe  actual  delivery  of  institutional  credit  to  SMEs  has  been  grossly  inadequate  in \nBangladesh.  This  is  re-emphasized  by  the  findings  from  the  INSPIRED  survey,  which \nhighlighted  that  68.6%  of  small  enterprises  and  44.7%  of  medium-sized  enterprises  identified \naccess  to  finance  as  a  major  constraint.12 Based  on  analysis  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB),  the  overall  demand\u2013supply  gap  for  SME  credit  is  estimated  to  exceed  Tk529  billion \n($6.8 billion).  This  gap  is  even  more  pronounced  for  nonmetropolitan  SMEs\u2014SME  lending  is \nconcentrated in urban areas, thereby limiting the potential of rural development. \n \n10.  Women in Bangladesh are not reaching their economic potential. Most engage in small, \nsubsistence-based  activities  in  trade  and  retail,  but  they  are  less  educated  and  have \nsignificantly  less  access  to  SME  finance  than  men.13 Women  often  lack  the  business  skills, \nknowledge,  and  access  to  networks  to  increase  their  entrepreneurial  capacity.  The  rates  of \nwomen  entrepreneurship  are  lower  among  rural  nonfarm  enterprises  than  metropolitan  firms. \nNonmetropolitan  enterprises  owned  by  women  are  smaller,  younger,  and  more  likely  to  be \ninformal and home-based. \n\n                                                 \n9  J.

This ratio has remained stable over the last 5 years. \n\n\fEnabling  environment.  Lessons  from  previous  FILs  suggest  that  successful  projects \n11. \nneed to build on operationalizing three basic institutional pillars: (i) a credit information bureau, \n(ii) registration of movable and immovable property, and (iii) business development services.14  \n \nThe  government  facilitated  the  automation  of  the  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB)  at \n12. \nBangladesh  Bank  to  ensure  the  availability  of  a  credit  history  for  SMEs.  Bangladesh  Bank \nlaunched  CIB  online  services  in  July  2011  to  provide  quick  reports  to  banks  and  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions.  In  addition,  most  credit  rating  agencies  operating  in  Bangladesh  assign \ncredit  ratings  to  some  of  the  larger  SMEs.  These  efforts  broaden  the  coverage  of  SME \nborrowers and help banks shift from purely collateral-based lending to cash-flow-based lending. \nEfforts  are  also  ongoing\u2014supported  by  the  World  Bank\u2014to  expand  the  coverage  of  the  CIB \nservices to include the cottage industry and micro segment of the SME sector.15  \n\n \n\n13.  While the registration  of  immovable  property  operates  well  in  Bangladesh,  a  structured \nand  modern  secured  transaction  system  is  still  absent  because  the  legal  and  institutional \nframeworks for taking security in movable property are fragmented, incomplete, and opaque. As \na result, lenders lack the confidence to extend credit secured only by movable property, which \nlimits the availability of crucial secured financing alternatives for SMEs. The World Bank Group\u2019s \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  is  currently  providing  TA  to  support  secured  lending  and  to \nestablish  a  movable  collateral  policy,  which  is  expected  to  help  the  under-banked  segment  of \nBangladesh\u2019s population to access bank financing. \n \n14. \nThe  government  provides  business  support  and  capacity  development  TA  to  SMEs, \nmainly  through  the  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage  Industries  Corporation  (BSCIC),  SME \nFoundation  (SMEF),  and  Bangladesh  Bank.  Among  the  development  partners  in  Bangladesh, \none  of  the  largest  projects  in  the  field  of  SME  business  development  services  is  KATALYST \n(developing business service markets), funded by several bilateral development agencies.16 \n \nADB support for small and medium-sized enterprise development in Bangladesh. \n15. \nSince  the  early  1970s,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  ADB  have  engaged  in  extensive \npolicy  dialogue  on  SME  sector  development.17 Recent  interventions  include  the  SME  Sector \nDevelopment  Program,  which  created  a  policy  and  regulatory  framework  conducive  to  SME \ngrowth. 18  This  was  followed  by  the  first  SME  Development  Project  (SMEDP1),  which \naccelerated SME development in rural areas by boosting their access to medium- and long-term \ncredit  with  an  emphasis  on  women-led  SMEs.19 Lessons  from  SMEDP1  were  incorporated  in \n                                                 \n14 A special evaluation study prepared by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department in 2012 on ADB\u2019s Microfinance \nDevelopment Strategy 2000 highlighted, in particular, the need for strengthening financial literacy among micro and \nsmall borrowers in ADB\u2019s developing member countries. This recommendation was incorporated into the design of \nSMEDP2  by  using  part  of  the  attached  technical  assistance  to  establish  incubation  facilities  at  educational \ninstitutions and thereby promote entrepreneurship and access to finance. \n\n15 The finance sector support project of the World Bank\u2014approved in May 2015\u2014will help broaden the CIB\u2019s scope \nto include credit information pertaining to the microfinance segment.

The \ncredit  assistance  loan  of  $76  million  under  SMEDP1  was  fully  disbursed  by  December  2013\u20141  year  before  the \nend of the utilization period. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthe design of SMEDP2.20 The proposed intervention is designed primarily as a credit line to the \nSME  sector.21 It  is  backed  up  by  measures  to  strengthen  access  to  credit  and  support  the \nbackward and forward links of SMEs to the formal sectors through a capacity development TA, \nall of which supports the government\u2019s development agenda. SMEDP2 is a continuation of the \nsuccessful collaboration between ADB and the government under SMEDP1.22 \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  will  be  continued  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  the \n16. \ndevelopment  of  the  SME  sector  outside  the  metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong, \naligned  with  the  SME  Strategy  Paper  for  the  government\u2019s  forthcoming  Seventh  Five-Year \nPlan.23 The outcome is increased in the number and size of commercially viable SMEs, as well \nas employment in the SME sector. \n \nC. \n \nOutput  1:  Increased  medium-  and  long-term  credit,  especially  to  SMEs,  SME \n17. \nclusters,  and  BSCIC  estates  in  rural  areas.  SMEDP2  will  comprise  a  credit  line  of  $200 \nmillion for boosting access to medium- and long-term financing through PFIs for eligible SMEs \n(and  eligible  SMEs  organized  as  SME  clusters  and  BSCIC  estates)  outside  the  metropolitan \nareas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong.24 The  credit  line  will  enhance  credit  delivery,  in  particular  to \npriority  sectors,  consistent  with  the  national  industrial  strategy  for  promoting  exports  and  high \nvalue-added  industries.  The  strategy  targets  SMEs  in  the  rural  areas  and  will  have  two \ncomponents: \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nComponent  A\u2014comprising  two-thirds  of  the  credit  line  ($133.3  million)  and \ncatering  to  the  smaller  firms  of  the  sector,  e.g.,  cottage  industries  and  micro \nenterprises. Under this component, 15% (i.e., $20 million) will be earmarked for \nlending to women-led SMEs. \nComponent  B\u2014comprising  the  balance  ($66.7  million),  the  proceeds  of  which \nwill be onlent by the PFIs to medium-sized enterprises. \n\n \n18. \nOutput 2: Strengthened capacity of SME entrepreneurs to access bank financing. \nThis  output  under  the  capacity  development  TA  will  support  the  establishment  of  incubation \nfacilities at educational institutions to promote entrepreneurship by (i) identifying areas (industry \nand/or  sector)  for  support  from  incubation  facilities,  (ii)  developing  a  country  strategy  with \ndetailed  action  plans  (and  cost  estimates)  for  incubation  facilities,  (iii)  designing  guidelines  for \nthe  selection  and  graduation  of  entrepreneurs  applying  for  business  incubation  services,  and \n(iv) establishing a sex-disaggregated performance monitoring system for incubation facilities. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Strengthened  managerial  and  technical  capacity  of  small  and  medium-\nsized  enterprise  support  institutions  (Bangladesh  Bank,  SME  Foundation,  BSCIC)  and \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2015.

Capacity  development  of  SME  support  institutions  will  facilitate  cluster \nfinancing  by  building  up  SMEs  ability  to  form  alliances  and  clustering,  so  that  small  firms  will \ngrow and cooperate with larger firms, and by sensitizing PFI officials to promote loans to SME \nclusters and BSCIC estates. \n \nOutput  4:  Enhanced  women-led  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises\u2019  access  to \n20. \nbank  finance  and  financial  services. This output of the TA will boost the capacity of women \nentrepreneurs\u2019  development  units  at  Bangladesh  Bank  head  office  and  nine  branches,  and \ndedicated  women\u2019s  desks  at  PFIs  by  (i)  standardizing  PFI  procedures,  (ii)  facilitating  dialogue \nand  cross-fertilization  of  practices  among  PFIs,  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  progress  in  women\u2019s \naccess  to  and  use  of  financial  resources  and  services.  The  output  will  build  the  capacity  of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  by  supporting  the  development  of  an  informal  network  of  PFIs,  women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 development units, and women\u2019s business associations with a focus on access \nto finance and good practices. \n \nD. \n  \nThe project is estimated to cost $333.3 million (Table 1). The government has requested \n21. \na  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The \nloan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as are set \nforth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreement. 25 The  government  and  the  eligible  PFIs  are \nexpected to contribute the taka equivalent of $50 million each, while the participating SMEs are \nassumed to contribute 10% of individual subproject costs in the form of equity. 26 \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment and Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (ordinary capital resources) \nGovernment (Bangladesh Bank) \nParticipating financial institutions \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises \nTotal \na The small and medium-sized enterprise contribution of 10% is based on the assumption that SMEs \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n60.0 \n15.0 \n15.0 \n10.0 \n100.0 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n200.0 \n50.0 \n50.0 \n33.3a \n333.3 \n\nwill contribute 10% of the individual subproject cost in the form of equity. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nThe Ministry of Finance, through its Bank and Financial Institutions Division, will relend \n22. \nto Bangladesh Bank the ADB loan in local currency under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms \nand  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risks. \nBangladesh  Bank  will  onlend  the  ADB  funds,  along  with  its  own  share,  to  eligible  PFIs  for \nmaking subloans to eligible subborrowers to finance eligible subprojects under a standard form \nparticipation agreement acceptable to ADB.27 \n\n                                                 \n25 The interest will not include any maturity premium. This is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s \n\n26 Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions, Subprojects, and Subborrowers (accessible from the list of \n\nchoice of repayment options and dates. \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n27 The Bangladesh Bank rate is currently about 5% and can be considered a proxy for cost of funds in Bangladesh. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nEligible PFIs will further lend the Bangladesh Bank funds under subloan agreements to \n23. \neligible  subborrowers  at  interest  rates  that  reflect  their  cost  of  funds  plus  a  spread  to  cover \ntransaction  costs  and  risks,  reflecting  full  commercial  and  competitive  terms  at  the  PFIs\u2019 \ndiscretion.28 The maximum size for subloans under component A of the credit line will be Tk10 \nmillion,  and  Tk30  million  under  component  B.  Each  subproject  will  be  financed  with  a \nsubborrower  equity  contribution  of  10%,  a  PFI  debt  contribution  of  15%,  a  government  debt \ncontribution  of  15%,  and  a  contribution  from  ADB  funds  of  60%,  to  maximize  leveraging  of \nresources  through  this  project.29 Correspondingly,  16.7%  of  each  subloan  is  financed  by  the \nPFI\u2019s  funds,  16.7%  of  such  subloan  is  financed  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank  contribution,  and \n66.6% of such subloan is financed by ADB. While the minimum term of each subloan will be set \nat 2 years, a maximum of 30% of such a subloan may be used for working capital expenditures \nof the same subborrower and must be repaid at a minimum term of 1 year.30 The minimum term \nof  subloans  to  women  entrepreneurs  is  1  year.31 Subloans  will  only  be  provided  to  finance \nactivities  not  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  and  will  be  subject  to  post-\nlending monitoring and review by ADB. \n \nChallenge fund. Following a request from Bangladesh Bank, SMEDP2 will introduce, on \n24. \na pilot basis, a challenge fund of up to $20 million, to better align PFIs\u2019 comparative advantage \nas lenders and to catalyze funds from the finance sector into target areas.32 This will result in a \nwider  range  of  financial  products,  new  channels  for  the  delivery  of  financial  services,  and \nopportunities for the most disadvantaged groups, with the ultimate goal of stimulating long-term \ninclusive,  pro-poor  economic  growth.  Potential  focal  areas  that  could  be  targeted  under  this \nconcept  are  (i)  disadvantaged  geographical  regions  of  Bangladesh  with  high  incidences  of \npoverty,  (ii)  SME  segments  that  lack  access  to  finance,  or  (iii)  new  financial  products  and \nservices  tailored  to  the  needs  of  the  target  SME  groups.  A  fund  manager  will  oversee  the \nimplementation and operationalization of the challenge fund. It is expected that a maximum of \nfive PFIs will be selected to participate. Funds not utilized by the winning PFIs within a period of \n2 years will be transferred back to the main corpus under SMEDP2. The introduction of such a \nchallenge fund would be complementary to the normal disbursement process under SMEDP2. \n \nE. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance,  acting  through  its  Bank  and  Financial  Institutions  Division,  will \n25. \nbe the executing agency, and Bangladesh Bank will be the implementing agency.33 Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s project management unit will be the SME and Special Programs Department established \nunder SMEDP2. \n \n26. \nthe project administration manual.34 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB  requires  such  loans  to  have  market-based  rates.

The  major  outputs  and  activities  of  the  TA  include  (i)  facilitating  the \nestablishment of incubation centers to promote entrepreneurship; (ii) providing assistance in the \ndevelopment  of  SME  clusters  and  BSCIC  estates  to  boost  their  capacity  to  access  bank \nfinancing  and  strengthen  the  backward  and  forward  links  of  SMEs  to  the  formal  sector, \nparticularly the larger export-driven industries; (iii) capacity building at Bangladesh Bank and the \nPFIs  to  ensure  the  effective  functioning  of  the  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  development  units  at \nBangladesh  Bank  branches  and  dedicated  women\u2019s  desks  at  PFIs,  and  to  educate  women \n\n                                                 \n35 A possible alternative candidate for project administration\u2014or at least part of it\u2014is SMEF, which was established \nby the Government of Bangladesh in November 2006 as part of ADB\u2019s SME Sector Development Program as an \nindependent  apex  body  for  SME  promotion  under  the  Companies  Act,  1994.  ADB  met  with  SMEF  on  several \noccasions  to  discuss  its  credit  wholesaling  program,  which  channels  funds  through  PFIs  to  SMEs  and  SME \nclusters  in  Bangladesh.  SMEF  is  being  considered  as  a  second  implementing  agency  for  the  credit  line  of  the \nproject, for an  SME  cluster  subcomponent  of  maximum  $20  million under  SMEDP2\u2014subject to  SMEF\u2019s meeting \nADB\u2019s due diligence requirement and demonstrating its ability to implement the ADB project. If SMEF fails to meet \nADB\u2019s  due  diligence  requirements  or  demonstrate  its  ability  to  implement  the  ADB  project,  then  the  funds \nprovisionally allocated to SMEF will be utilized under the credit line administered by Bangladesh Bank. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nentrepreneurs  in  selected  districts  on  financial  and  legal  literacy;  and  (iv)  providing  support  to \nBangladesh  Bank  to  establish  an  administration  unit  for  the  implementation  of  the  proposed \nchallenge  fund  under  the  SMEDP2. 36  This  output  will  also  include  the  strengthening  of \nBangladesh Bank\u2019s information technology systems, so that it can carry out its monitoring and \nreporting  functions  under  SMEDP2.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  for  the  implementation \nactivities  under  the  capacity  development  TA  subproject  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The disbursements under the \ncapacity  development  TA  subproject  will  be  made  directly  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).37 The \nBank and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. \nThe TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years starting from March 2016. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nSignificant economic benefits are expected to arise from the project since all subprojects \n29. \nfinanced  under  SMEDP2  will  have  to  be  economically  viable.  The  project  will  help  (i) improve \nthe efficiency of the medium- and long-term credit market; (ii) step up the capacity and capability \nof  PFIs  to  provide  profitable  loans to  viable  SMEs  in the  country\u2019s  rural  areas,  including  some \nwomen-led companies; and (iii) help strengthen the backward and forward links of SMEs to the \nlarger, more formal sectors such as the export industry. The project is expected to have positive \nimpacts on growth, development, and employment creation, thus benefiting the private sector of \nBangladesh.  Due  diligence  confirmed  the  demand  for  local-currency-denominated,  medium- \nand long-term subloans to the targeted SMEs. PFI eligibility criteria were defined, and potential \nPFIs identified.38 Financial and integrity due diligence was completed for the top four PFIs, and \nbrief financial due diligence was carried out for the next 15 PFIs involved in SMEDP1.39  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, \nand  environmental  and social  safeguards  were discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Government  of \nBangladesh  and  Bangladesh  Bank  and  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  specific \nrequirements  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual. 40  Procurement  by  the \nsubborrowers  will  be  in  accordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial  practices \nacceptable to ADB, as required under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n31. \nThe overall financial management risk is assessed as moderate. Based on the financial \ndue  diligence  conducted,  Bangladesh  Bank  needs  to  further  strengthen  its  capacity  and  staff \nstrength,  particularly  in  the  area  of  project  administration  and  supervision.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment,  including  a  financial  analysis  of  the  potential  PFIs,  indicated  that \n(i) internal audit units with an independent reporting structure exist at each bank; (ii) the financial \nstatements  are  audited  by  reputable,  internationally  affiliated  audit  firms;  (iii)  formal  risk \nmanagement units exist; (iv) capital adequacy ratios are above regulatory requirements; (v) the \n                                                 \n36 Output and activity (ii) will be provided by SMEF. \n37 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 Detailed due diligence has been carried out for four candidate PFIs: IDLC Finance Limited, Eastern Bank Limited, \n\nMicro Industries Development Assistance and Services, and Mercantile Bank Limited. \n\n39 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Such due diligence \n\nwill be completed before selection of PFIs is finalized. \n\n40 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nprofitability ratios are reasonable; and (vi) net interest margins are adequate. \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Bank and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual (footnote 37). \n \nC. \n \n33. \nPoverty  impact,  gender,  and  social  dimensions.  Recognizing  that  high  incidence of \npoverty  and  lack  of  gainful  employment  fuel  discontent  and  unrest,  the  project\u2019s  rural \ndevelopment impact contributes to stability in Bangladesh\u2019s less developed areas. The project\u2019s \npoverty  impact  is  discussed  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy.41 Potential \ngender  and  social  impacts  were  reviewed.  A  gender  assessment  is  reflected  in  the  project \ndocuments  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design,  which  is  categorized  thematically  as \neffective gender mainstreaming.42 SMEDP2 contributes to women\u2019s empowerment by narrowing \ngender disparities through access to financial resources. \n \nD. \n \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \n34. \nFI  treated  as  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples,  and  complies  with  ADB  information  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  The \nproject  is  expected  to  have  minimal  environmental  impact  since  the  subloans  to  SMEs  will  be \nmainly  for  light  manufacturing,  trade,  and  service  activities.  Similarly,  the  subloans  will  be  for \nactivities that will not trigger any involuntary resettlements, nor have any impact on indigenous \npeople.  An  environmental  and  social  management  system  is  not  required  because  the \nsubproject investments carry minimal or no environmental or social risks. Bangladesh Bank has \ndeveloped environmental risk management guidelines for banks and financial institutions. These \nwere endorsed by the government on behalf of the PFIs and are mandatory regulations under \nthe  Financial  Institutions  Act,  1993. 43  To  ensure  that  subprojects  comply  with  applicable \ngovernment regulations and that loan proceeds will not be used to finance activities that are on \nADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activity  list  and  are  categorized  as  FI-C  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, a subproject screening checklist will be made \nmandatory for implementation by all PFIs under SMEDP2.44 The PFIs will report on the status of \nimplementing this screening checklist to ADB through Bangladesh Bank. \n \nE. \n \n35. \nThe  project\u2019s  risks  and  all  measures  identified  to  reduce  them  were  carefully  analyzed \nduring  preparation  and  appraisal.  The  overall  project  risk  has  been  rated  low  because  of  the \nstrong record of the implementing agency in managing similar projects in the SME sector using \nADB\u2019s  guidelines,  the  strong  preparatory  effort  of  Bangladesh  Bank,  and  the  tested  design  of \nthe  project  in  successful  operations  under  SMEDP1.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized \n(Table 3) and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.45 \n                                                 \n41 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 Available at Bangladesh Bank. https://www.bb.org.bd/aboutus/regulationguideline/guidelist.php. \n44 Financial  Intermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Arrangement  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nThe creditworthiness of \nSMEs in some locations \ncould affect utilization of \nthe project\u2019s credit line. \n\nWeak operational and/or \nfinancial strength of PFIs \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nADB\u2019s assessment indicates that PFIs have significant opportunities for \nlending to viable SMEs outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and \nChittagong. Furthermore, the anticipated improvement of the borrowing \ncapacity of SMEs through the attached capacity development technical \nassistance will indirectly help strengthen their creditworthiness. \nA significant number of experienced PFIs have indicated strong demand for \nfunding from the credit line. Operational weaknesses of some PFIs are \nbeing dealt with through (i) improved access to credit information, \n(ii) strengthened business development services and financial literacy, \n(iii) strengthened governance structures and risk management practices, \n(iv) risk-based pricing, and (v) Bangladesh Bank oversight. \n\nThese risks have been dealt with by assessing PFI eligibility and \ncommitment upfront. In addition, PFIs with performance shortcomings or \nother material issues may be excluded from the credit line under SMEDP2. \n\nImplementation delays if \nthe PFIs fail to sustain \nperformance standards \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises, \nSMEDP2 = Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project. \nNote:  The  proposed  ADB  PFI  eligibility  criteria  go  beyond  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  prudential  standards  and  include \nadditional  requirements  such  as  limits  on  a  minimum  credit  rating  of  BBB-,  a  CAMEL  rating  of  3  or  better,  and  no \ninvolvement in any major scam. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n36. \nThe  government  and  Bangladesh  Bank  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37. \nthe project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government and Bangladesh Bank have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n38. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $200,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second \nSmall  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  20 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nproject agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent \nof $2,000,000 to the Government of Bangladesh for the Strengthening Capacities \nof  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Stakeholders  to  Access  Bank  Financing \nand Services to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction on a grant \nbasis. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n8 December 2015 \n\n \n\n\f \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nContinued  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  the  development  of  the  SME  sector  outside \nthe  metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  (aligned  with  the  SME  Strategy  Paper  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s forthcoming Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020)a \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nIncrease in the number \nand size of commercially \nviable SMEs, as well as \nemployment in the SME \nsector \n\nOutputs \n1.
