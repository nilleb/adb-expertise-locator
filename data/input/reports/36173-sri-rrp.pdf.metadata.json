Appendix 11 contains a summary resettlement plan. \n \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and \npublic  health  for  the  urban  and  suburban  residents  in  Colombo \nthrough  improvements  to  wastewater  management  services.  The \nProject  will  support  (i)  upgrading  the  sewerage  infrastructure, \nincluding  pumping  stations,  sewer  pipes,  and  discharge  outfalls; \n(ii)  strengthening  institutional  and  operational  capacity  in  asset \nmanagement,  financial  management,  operational  performance \nmonitoring,  environmental \nregulatory  compliance,  customer \nservices,  and  pro-poor  sanitation  services;  and  (iii)  project \nmanagement and implementation. \n \nColombo  is  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economic  and  administrative  center.  The \nGovernment,  in  its  Ten-Year  Development  Framework,  2006\u2013\n2016, targets high and steady economic growth and modernization \nof  the  capital  region  as  the  national  growth  engine.  The Western \nRegion  Structure  Plan,  adopted  by  the  Government  as  the \ndevelopment plan for the country\u2019s capital region, emphasizes the \ncritical  role  of  basic \nincluding \nwastewater management, in sustaining the national economy and \nimproving the quality of life in the Greater Colombo area.  \n \nWhile the Colombo urban area is rapidly expanding, the coverage \nof  the  existing  public  sewerage  infrastructure  is  limited.  Most  of \nthe  system  has  been  run  exceeding  its  technical  life  and  is \ntherefore inefficient and unreliable. Emergency repairs rather than \nplanned  maintenance  are  normal  practices.  Assets  are  not \ninventoried and there is no accurate database on the condition of \nassets. The customer database is inaccurate and is not regularly \nupdated. Frequent blockages in the system cause flooding in low-\nlying areas and the uncontrolled overflow has serious environment \nand  public  health  implications.  There  is  no  institutionalized \nmechanism  to  monitor  operational  performance  or  environmental \ncompliance.  \n\ninfrastructure  and  services, \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nis \n\nis \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe  Project \n\nimproved  wastewater  management  services \n\n \nThe  expected \nimproved  urban \nenvironment and public health for 1.5 million urban and suburban \nresidents  in  Greater  Colombo.

The  relending  terms  for  the  loan  portion  will  be  at \nthe rate of 10% per annum, with a repayment period of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years. \n \nUntil 30 June 2015  \n \n31 December 2014  \n\n \nMinistry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (MLGPC) \n \nMLGPC  will  be  the  Project\u2019s  Executing  Agency.  CMC  will  be  the \nimplementing agency responsible for most of the activities, except \nfor  the  pumping  station  rehabilitation  works  within  the  NWSDB \nservice area, for which NWSDB will be the implementing agency. \nA project management unit (PMU) will be established within CMC, \ndirectly under the municipal commissioner, led by a CMC officer at \nsenior management level for the duration of the Project. A project \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  under  NWSDB  for \nimplementing  the  works  within  NWSDB  service  area.  A  national \nproject  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nMLGPC  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  coordination  to  the \ngovernment agencies involved in the administrative process of the \nProject. \n \nA  draft  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared  based  on \ndiscussions  with  the  proposed  executing  and  implementing \nagencies.  Procurements  to  be  financed  by  the  Project  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive \nbidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated \nto  cost  $3  million  or  more,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at \n$500,000 or higher.  \n \nThe size of the procurement packages will depend on the nature \nof  the  works  involved,  on  the  need  to  enable  reasonable \ncompetition in the bidding, and on minimizing the PMU's contract \nadministration  and  management  burden.  The  Project  proposes  a \ndesign\u2013build\u2013operate  contract  for  the  main  sewerage  system \nrehabilitation  works  to  ensure  an  integrated  system  design  and \nsustained  operation  of \nthe  rehabilitated  system.  The  draft \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n \nAn estimated 1,007 person-months (77 international, 930 national) \nfacilitate  project \nof  consulting  services  are \nmanagement  and \nthe \nimplementation,  and \ninstitutional and operational capacity of CMC. The PMU will recruit \ntwo  consulting  firms  for  (i)  design,  supervision,  and  project \nmanagement \nand \n(ii) \noperational \nimprovement support to the PMU and CMC. The consulting firms \nwill  be  recruited  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe Project will directly benefit about 645,000 residents in Greater \nColombo  by  providing  them  with  better  wastewater  management \nservices, with a resulting improvement in the urban environment, \nhealth,  living  conditions,  and  productivity  of  the  residents.  A  total \nof  1.5  million  residents  in  Greater  Colombo  will  benefit  indirectly \nfrom a better urban environment. The Project will have significant \nnet  positive  environmental  impacts,  including  better  marine  and \ninland  water  quality  and  consequently  improved  public  hygiene \nand  sanitary  conditions.  The  Project  will  involve  no  significant \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  The \nProject will improve the governance, finance, and service delivery \nof  the  municipal  service  provider  by  supporting  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development.  \n \n \n \n\nPMU \nfinancial \n\nto  strengthen \n\ndevelopment, \n\ninstitutional \n\nrequired \n\nsupport \n\nPIU; \n\nand \n\nand \n\nto \n\nto \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  main  risks  are  (i)  a  start-up  delay  and  slow  project \nimplementation  because  of  the  limited  experience  of  CMC  in \nimplementing an ADB project of this scale, and (ii) a possible lack \nof  sustainability \nthe  cost  of  operation  and \nin  recovering \nmaintenance and debt services.  \n \nThe  risk  of  a  start-up  delay  and  slow  project  implementation  will \nbe  mitigated  by  the  early  establishment  of  the  PMU  and  the \nrecruitment  of  qualified  staff.  A  capacity  development  technical \nassistance  project  will  provide  support  to  prepare  for  project \nimplementation,  and  this  will  be  followed  up  by  the  design, \nsupervision,  and  management  consultants  during  the  Project \nimplementation period. \n \nThe  sustainability  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  a  combination  of \nmeasures.  The  Project \nintroduces  a  design\u2013build\u2013operate \ncontract  that  will  increase  the  predictability  of  the  technical  and \nbudgetary  requirements,  helping  CMC  to  put  in  place  the \nnecessary  O&M  budget  in  a  planned  manner.  The  Project  also \nsupports  CMC  to  strengthen  its  institutional,  operational,  and \nfinancial  capacity,  including  (i)  building  up  and  implementing  a \ncost-recovery  mechanism;  (ii)  introducing  an  asset  management\nsystem;  (iii)  implementing  a  performance  budgeting  system;  (iv) \ncreating  a  dedicated  accounting  code  and  an  exclusive  budget \nline for sewerage operations; and (v) institutionalizing a customer \ndatabase  and  services,  all  of  which  will  contribute  to  enhancing \nthe sustainability of wastewater services delivery.   \n \nthe  Project  assumes  a \nAs \nfundamental  increase  in  revenue  from  property  tax  or  other \nrevenue  sources,  an  assurance  is  given  by  the  Government  and \nthe  implementing  agencies  that  they  will  increase  their  revenues \nto achieve cost recovery.  \n\nfinancial  sustainability  of \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fo\n80  00'E\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nDistrict \n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Highway\n\nNational Road\n\nRoad\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nCity/Municipal Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nPamunugama\n\no\n\n9  00'N\n\nJa-Ela\n\nKadana\n\nRagama\n\nDalugama\n\nKolonnawa\n\nKelaniya\nKelani River\n\nAgoda\n\nBiyagama\n\nColombo\n\nKottikawatta\n\nKaduwella\n\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE\n\nWellawatta\n\nBattaramulla\n\nAtturugiriya\n\nHabarakada\n\nDehiwala\n\nMaharagama\n\nHomagama\n\nPitipana\n\nDiyagama\n\nKesbewa\n\nMategoda\n\nMoratuwa\n\nMadapatha\n\nBolgoda Lake\n\nPanadura\n\no\n80  00'E\n\no\n80  00'E\n\nKankasanturai\n\nKodikamam\n\no\n81  30'E\n\nBay  o f  Bengal\n\nKilinochchi\n\nMullaittivu\n\nTanniyuttu\n\nP a l k     S t r a i t\n\nJaffna\n\nP a l k     B a y\n\nTalaimannar\n\no\n\n7  00'N\n\nMannar\n\nGulf  of \nMannar\n\nMankulam\nNORTHERN\n\nPuliyankulam\n\nVavuniya\n\nAnuradhapura\n\nHorowupotana\n\nTrincomalee\n\nPuttalam\n\nNORTH  CENTRAL\n\nTambuttegama\n\nKekirawa\n\nHingurakgoda\n\nWelikanda\n\no\n\n7  00'N\n\nValaichchenai\n\nE A S T E R N\n\nBatticaloa\n\nPolonnaruwa\n\nDambulla\n\nCENTRAL\n\nMatale\n\nKandy\n\nAmpara\n\no\n\n9  00'N\n\nKegalle\n\nGampola\n\nGampaha\n\nNuwara Eliya\n\nBadulla\n\nAvissawella\nHatton\n\nTalawakele\n\nU V A\n\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE\n\nMoratuwa\n\nPROJECT  LOCATION\n\nRatnapura\n\nKalutara\n\nWESTERN\n\nPelmadulla\n\nHalangoda\n\nSABARAGAMUWA\n\nAlutgama\n\nAmbalangoda\n\nElpitiya\n\nBandarawela\n\nMonaragala\n\nWellawaya\n\nHikkaduwa\n\nAkuressa\n\nS O U T H E R N\n\nHambantota\n\nGalle\n\nTangalle\n\nMatara\n\no\n80  00'E\n\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n\no\n81  30'E\n\nNORTH\nWESTERN\n\nKurunegala\n\nPolgahawela\n\nWarakapola\n\nChilaw\n\nMadampe\n\nNegombo\n\nMinuwangoda\n\no\n\n9  00'N\n\nColombo\n\no\n\n9  00'N\n\nSRI LANKA\nGREATER COLOMBO\nWASTEWATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT\n\nN\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nKilometers\n\n09-2637 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Greater  Colombo  Wastewater \nManagement Project.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSri Lanka\u2019s economy has grown at an average of 5% per annum over the past 30 years.2 \n2. \nPer  capita  income  has  increased  more  than  four  times  from  $431  in  1990  to  $2,016  in  2008. \nAlongside this economic growth, the country has experienced continuing urbanization, reflected \nin the size of the urban population and the extent of the urban areas.3 The urban population was \nestimated to be about 6 million in 2006, 30% of the national total, and it is growing at 3% per \nyear, compared with a national growth rate of 1.1%. Urban migration caused by the prolonged \nconflict and low productivity in rural areas has contributed to this trend. Despite this process, the \nurban  infrastructure  and  services  are  limited,  fail  to  meet  demands,  and  do  not  support \neconomic or social needs.4   \n \n3. \nSector Performance. In its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  (Government)  identified  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nadequate  sanitation  as  priority  objectives.  The  Government  has  set  targets  for  2015  of  \n(i)  increasing  the  proportion  of  households  with  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  to \n86%, and (ii) increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved sanitation to \n93%. While a recent government report5 indicated that Sri Lanka will meet the MDG targets for \nwater supply and sanitation services, the condition of water supply and sanitation services is still \na concern. The coverage of piped water is still very low (30%). Even in the capital region, only \nabout 60% of the population is connected to piped water and only 50% has a continuous supply \nof piped water. In provincial urban areas, coverage is in the range of 5-20%, with an intermittent \nsupply of water for about 16 hours a day. \n \n4. \nAlthough  the  country  is  reported  to  have  made  substantial  progress  in  increasing  the \npopulation  with  access  to  sanitation  from  69%  in  1990  to  91%  in  2004,6 only  3%  of  the  total \npopulation  is  connected  to  the  public  sewerage  system.  The  vast  majority  of  urban  residents \nrely on septic tanks or have no private sanitation facilities. The existing infrastructure is grossly \ninadequate  and  malfunctioning.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  sanitation  has  been \nneglected;  of  the  total  investment  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector  during  last  two  decades, \nless than 5% was spent on sanitation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Greater  Colombo  encompasses  seven  local  authorities:  three  municipal  councils  (Colombo,  Dehiwela/Mt  Lavinia, \nSri Jayawardhenapura-Kotte), two urban councils, and two pradeshiya sabhas (smallest political unit in periurban \nor rural areas).  \n\n2  While  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economy  remained  relatively  resilient  in  2008,  growing  at  6%,  its  growth  is  forecast  to  fall  to \nabout  4.5%  in  2009  due  to  the  weakening  economic  and  financial  outlook  affected  by  the  deepening  global \nrecession. The International Monetary Fund approved a $2.6 billion loan in 2009 to support the economic reform \nprogram, strengthen the country\u2019s fiscal position, and support its post-conflict reconstruction and relief efforts. \n\n3  Sri Lanka had a relatively high population density of 308 people per square kilometer in 2008, one of the highest \n\nafter India among ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n\n4  Sri Lanka\u2019s public investment in infrastructure has been low for two reasons: first, the Government lacked the fiscal \nheadroom to increase investments; second, Sri Lanka's increasingly complex political economy makes formulating \nand implementing decisions difficult. \n\n5   Department of Census and Statistics. 2008.

The \n\nindicators and figures differ depending on sources. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n5. \nSector  Institutions. Water supply and sanitation services in Sri Lanka are provided by \nboth central and local governments. In 1974, a central government agency, the National Water \nSupply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB),  was  established  and  several  urban  water  supply  and \nsanitation  schemes  operated  by  local  authorities  were  transferred  to  it.  The  NWSDB  became \nthe  primary  implementing  agency  for  publicly-financed  development  projects  in  the  sector. \nHowever, the Government\u2019s decentralization policy, supported by the thirteenth amendment to \nthe  Constitution  in  1987,  drove  NWSDB  to  return  municipal  services  to  local  authorities  and \ndevolve  its  role  in  investment  and  operation  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  to  local \nauthorities.  Most  local  authorities  have  been  reluctant  to  take  over  these  responsibilities \nbecause of their limited institutional and financial capacity. Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) is \nthe only municipal council to provide comprehensive sewerage and sanitation services within its \njurisdiction.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities7 \n\n1. \n\nChallenges in Wastewater Management in Greater Colombo \n\n6. \nGreater  Colombo.  Colombo  is  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economic  and  administrative  center.  The \nGovernment,  in  its  Ten-Year  Development  Framework,  2006-2016,8 targets  high  and  steady \neconomic growth and  modernization of the capital city and its environs as the national growth \nengine.  The  Western  Region  Physical  Structure  Plan, 9 adopted  by  the  Government  as  the \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  country\u2019s  capital  region,  emphasizes  the  critical  role  of  basic \ninfrastructure  and  services,  including  wastewater  management,  in  supporting  economic \ndevelopment and improving the quality of life in the Greater Colombo area.  \n \nInadequate  Sewerage  Infrastructure  and  Services.  While  Colombo  is  rapidly \n7. \nexpanding, coverage of the public sewerage network is limited. The  wastewater  master plan10 \nestimated that 66% of the Greater Colombo population was served by on-site facilities, 19% by \nthe  public  sewerage  system, 11  and  15%  was  not  served  by  any  facilities.  People  without \nfacilities  disposed  of  their  wastewater  on  the  seashore,  in  canals,  and  waterways,  and  on \navailable open ground. \n \n8. \nThe  existing  public  sewerage  network  in  Greater  Colombo  covers  the  area  in  CMC, \nDehiwela/Mount  Lavinia,  and  Kolonnawa,  which  have  a  resident  population  of  more  than \n838,000  and  a  floating  population  of  more  than  500,000.  The  sewerage  system  comprises  \n(i) about 320 kilometers (km) of sewers,12 (ii) 18 pumping stations within two catchments\u2014north \nand south, and (iii) two sea outfalls.13 Built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and \nexpanded in the 1980s,14 the system needs urgent repair, upgrading and expansion. The sewer \npipes suffer from blockages and collapses. One third of pumping facilities are broken, causing \n\n                                                 \n7  A problem and constraint analysis is in Appendix 2. An analysis of the sector is in Appendix 3. \n8  Department  of  National  Planning.  2006.

Regional Structure Plan of the Western Region Megapolis. Colombo. \n10  Engineering Science. 1993. Wastewater Master Plan for Greater Colombo. Colombo. \n11  It is estimated that in 2007 coverage of public sewerage system had expanded to about 25% of Greater Colombo. \n12 About 80% are small diameter (less than 300 mm) in clay and, more recently, polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Sewers up \nto 375 mm are glazed stoneware and those 450-600 mm are concrete. Force mains are often cast iron with lead \njoints.  \n\n13  One  is  in  the  northern  part  of  Colombo  at  Mutwal:  a  1,500-mm  diameter  and  2,053-m  long  outfall  capturing  the \nsewers from the northern catchment through the junction box in Madampityia pumping station. The other is in the \nsouthern part of Colombo at Wellawatta: a 1,500-mm diameter and 1,394-m long outfall capturing the sewers from \nCMC's southern catchment and the NWSDB's Dehiwala/Mt Lavinia systems through the junction box at Wellawatta \npumping station. \n\n \n\n14 The World Bank and the Saudi Fund financed the rehabilitation and expansion works. \n\n\f \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nfrequent overflow to other water courses. One of the sea outfalls is breached in the middle and \nits diffusers are not functional.15 \n \n9. \nOperation  and  Maintenance.  Most  of  the  system  is  old,  exceeding  its  technical  life, \ninefficient  and  unreliable,  incurring  high  power  cost.  Frequent  blockages  by  silt  and  other \nobstructions damage de-gritting equipment and pumps. There is no preventive maintenance or \nplanned replacement; instead, emergency repairs have become the normal practice and these \ncan  only  take  place  if  emergency  funds  are  available.  Assets  are  not  usually  inventoried  and \nthere is no accurate database on the condition of assets. Operational and maintenance works \nare  not  systematically  recorded.  The  customer  database  is  inaccurate  and  not  regularly \nupdated.  A  strategy  for  system  management  needs  to  address  these  operational  and \nmanagerial problems, along with the introduction of a planned maintenance system, an energy \naudit, and other operational efficiency enhancement mechanisms.  \n \n10. \n Institutional Framework and Capacity. The poor infrastructure and service delivery in \nthe Greater Colombo sewerage system also stems from an inadequate institutional framework \nand the weak capacity of service providers. There has been lack of clarity concerning the role of \nthe  two  key  institutions  involved  in  the  wastewater  management  services,  NWSDB  and  CMC, \nand  ambiguity  about  their  ownership  of  assets.16 An  ambiguous  institutional  framework  led  to \nover  a  decade  of  ineffective  management  and  low  accountability.  After  a  legal  opinion  by  the \nattorney  general  on  asset  ownership  in  2007,  CMC  is  confirmed  as  the  owner  as  well  as \noperator  of  the  sewerage  system  within  the  Colombo  municipality.  NWSDB  remains  the  asset \nowner  and  service  provider  outside  Colombo  municipality.  CMC  has  moderate  organizational \ncapacity, skills, and management tools and these need to be substantially improved. \n \nFinancial  Constraints.  The  financial  resources  obtained  through  local  tax  and \n11. \nGovernment subsidies are insufficient for CMC and NWSDB to make new investments, or even \nto  meet  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  sewerage  operations  of  both  have \nincurred  deficits  in  recent  years,  which  has  prevented  them  from  sustaining  regular  asset \nreplacements,  leading  to  poor  service  delivery.  While  NWSDB  has  recently  introduced  a \nsewerage  tariff  within  its  operational  jurisdiction,17 thereby  securing  a  dedicated  account  for \nwastewater  services,  the  sewerage  operation  in  CMC  is  not  delineated  from  the  drainage \noperation. Expenditures are met out of allocations from the general budget of the institution and \nthere is no independent accounting of revenue and expenditure for sewerage operations.  \n \nService  Regulation  and  Monitoring.  Current  sewerage  operational  practices 18 and \n12. \nuncontrolled  industrial  effluent  discharges  into  public  sewers  raise  serious  environmental \nconcerns  and  there  is  no  mechanism  in  place  to  monitor  water  quality  or  to  make  service \nproviders  comply  with  regulatory  standards.  Environmental  regulations  prescribed  by  the \nCentral Environmental Authority are not properly monitored or complied with. Service providers \n                                                 \n15  It is based on comprehensive assessment made in 1999, and confirmed by visual inspection undertaken in 2007 \nas  part  of  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  Preparing  the \nGreater Colombo Wastewater Project. Manila (TA 4531-SRI). \n\n16  Asset ownership has long been believed to belong to NWSDB, in accordance with the voluntary transfer order in \n1996 under the Section 64(1) of the NWSDB Law. However, this turned out to be invalid because of the absence of \nParliamentary  approval.  The  attorney  general  issued  a  legal  opinion  in  September  2007  that  CMC  was  the  legal \nowner  of  the  sewerage  assets  within  the  CMC  area,  a  determination  that  was  acknowledged  by  the  concerned \nagencies. \n\n17  The  introduction  of  a  sewerage  charge  was  approved  by  the  cabinet  in  September  2002.  Subsequently  the \nNWSDB board approved a sewerage tariff policy and a specific tariff structure which the minister of water supply \nand drainage also approved. Notification of a new sewerage tariff was gazetted in October 2007 and charging of \nsewerage tariff started in March 2008. As part of the system computerization at NWSDB, the form of the water bill \nwas modified and the sewerage charge has been incorporated into the water bill.  \n\n18 Because  of  malfunctioning  of  sewerage  pumping  stations  and  frequent  collapses  of  the  sewer  pipes,  the  system \n\noperator often resorts to emergency bypass arrangements for discharging to the surface water.  \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nhave  little  accountability  for  the  quality,  quantity,  timeliness,  and  reliability  of  the  services \nprovided. There is no institutionalized system to check the performance of wastewater service \nproviders regularly or to benchmark their performance against predetermined standards.  \n \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons \n\n2. \n  \n13. \nExternal  Assistance.  Appendix  4  contains  a  summary  of  past  and  ongoing  external \nassistance to the water supply and sanitation sector in Sri Lanka. In recent years, ADB and the \ngovernment of Japan have been the major development partners in water supply and sanitation \nin  the  urban  sector.  In  rural  areas,  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  have  supported  community \nparticipation in water and sanitation for over a decade. In Greater Colombo, the World Bank and \nSaudi  Fund  supported  rehabilitation  of  the  sewerage  system  in  1980s  and  1990s  and  the \ngovernments of Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden are currently providing financial and \ntechnical  support.  While  the  past  and  ongoing  development  supports  by  other  development \npartners  have  improved  parts  of  the  sewerage  system  in  Greater  Colombo,  rehabilitation  of \nmajor works, including 17 pumping stations and the two outfalls, remains a major necessity.  \n \nLessons. Lessons drawn from ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 operations in Sri \n14. \nLanka in the water and sanitation sector19 include: (i) outcomes of physical investments can only \nbe  sustained  if  they  are  accompanied  by  well-programmed  capacity  building  and  institutional \nstrengthening;  (ii)  handover  of  management  of  water  schemes  to  local  authorities  requires \ncontinued  support  during  the  transition  and  follow-up  period;  (iii)  capacity  development  efforts \nneed to include not only technical aspects of O&M but also planning and financial management; \n(iv) continued efforts are needed to improve self-financing performance through implementation \nof  sector  reforms,  covering  cost  recovery  and  commercial  discipline  of  service  agencies;  and  \n(v)  institutional  arrangements  should  lead  to  broader  participation,  such  as  through  public \nawareness  programs  and  capacity  building  activities  for  end-users.  These  lessons  have  been \nincorporated into the design of the Project.20  \n \n\n3. \n\nRationale: Sector Strategy and Opportunities \n\n \n15. \nGovernment\u2019s  Sector  Strategy.  Safe  water  supply  and  adequate  sanitation  are \npriorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  national  development  strategies.  The \nspecific goals of the Government include: (i) access to adequate sanitation provided to 93% of \nthe population of Sri Lanka by 2015, (ii) piped sewerage systems provided in major urban areas \nand  selected  growth  centers,  and  (iii)  standard  on-site  sanitation  made  available  to  all  not \ncurrently connected to a sewerage system or sanitation scheme. In addition, the Government\u2019s \nstrategy  highlights  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  financial  sustainability  and  institutional \ncapacity  of  key  sector  agencies,  including  NWSDB  and  local  authorities,  in  order  to  achieve \nsector goals. \n \nDecentralized Municipal Services. The Government\u2019s decentralization policy promotes \n16. \ndevolution  of  responsibility  for  municipal  services  in  order  to  enhance  accountability  and  build \nsustainability  in  service  delivery.  Local  authorities  will  require  substantial  capacity  building \nsupport if they are to perform their devolved mandates, including (i) enhancing skills for planning \nand asset management, (ii) making service delivery more accountable and improving customer \nrelations,  (iii)  improving  revenue  and  financial  management  to  recover  the  cost  of  service \n\n                                                 \n19 The lessons are extracted from various sources: ADB. 2008.

As it has recently been determined to be the owner of assets of \nthe  sewerage  system  within  Colombo  (para.  10),  CMC  is  now  responsible  for  fulfilling  its \nmandates  to  manage  the  assets  and  execute  capital  investment,  as  well  as  to  operate  and \nmaintain the system and deliver sewerage services to its customers. The Project will help CMC \nto  do  this  by  improving  wastewater  management  services  in  Colombo  and  its  suburban  area, \nupgrading  the  sewerage  infrastructure,  and  providing  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment support.21  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe expected impact of the Project is an improved urban environment and better public \nhealth  for  1.5  million  urban  and  suburban  residents  in  Greater  Colombo  through  improved \nmarine and inland water quality and a resulting improvement in hygiene and sanitary conditions. \nThe expected outcome of the Project is improved wastewater management services provided to \nabout 645,000 residents within the Project area through upgraded sewerage infrastructure and \nenhanced institutional and operational capacity of the service provider.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Project has three components. Component 1 will upgrade sewerage infrastructure, \n19. \nincluding  rehabilitating  the  main  sewerage  system  in  Greater  Colombo.  Component  2  will \nstrengthen  the  institutional  and  operational  capacity  for  (i)  asset  management  planning  and  \noperations, \nperformance  monitoring,  \n(iv)  environmental  compliance,  (v)  customer  services  and  public  awareness,  and  (vi)  pro-poor \nand  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services.  Component  3  will  improve  project  management  and \nimplementation as part of a comprehensive program of capacity building at wastewater service \nproviders. \n \n\nfinancial  management, \n\noperational \n\n(iii) \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Upgrading Sewerage Infrastructure  \n\n20. \nRehabilitation  of  Main  Sewerage  System.  This  subcomponent  will  (i)  rehabilitate  17 \npumping stations in the area covered by CMC, Kolonnawa and Dehiwela/Mt. Lavinia,22 including \nthe  provision  of  new  coarse  screens  and  grit  removal  facilities,  flow  meters  and  emergency \ngenerators;  (ii)  lay  four  new  pumping  mains  connecting  the  pumping  stations;23 and  (iii)  install \npre-treatment equipment in the form of fine screens and associated screens, washing facilities, \n\n                                                 \n21 The Project has been in preparation since 2004. A chronology is in Supplementary Appendix A .  \n22This includes: (i) new construction of 4 pumping stations in Bambalapitiya, Borella, Maligawatta, and New Fort; (ii) \nfull refurbishment of 4 pumping stations in St. Jones Market (CS-3), Harbour, Thimbirigasyaya, and Wanathamulla; \n(iii)  partial  refurbishment  of  3  pumping  stations  in  Slave  Islands,  Polwatta,  and  Vyswyke;  and  (iv)  partial \nrefurbishment  of  6  pumping  stations  in  Dehiwala,  Mt.  Lavinia,  Kolonnawa  (KSP  1),  Wellampitiya  (KSP  2), \nMeethotamulla (KSP 3), and KSP 4. Pumping stations listed in (i) through (iii) are in CMC service area, and those \nlisted in (iv) are in NWSDB service area.  \n\n23 This includes  (i) Bambalapitiya/Wellawatta (Marine drive), (ii) New Fort/CS-3, (iii) Harbour/Madampititya, and (iv) \n\nVyswyke/Madampitiya. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nand  sludge  disposal  facilities  at  two  downstream  pumping  stations,  immediately  prior  to \ndischarge through the sea outfalls.24  \n \n21. \nRehabilitation  of  Gravity  Sewers.  This  subcomponent  will  (i)  relay  10  km  of  critical \nsewers; and (ii) refurbish existing sewers by replacing control valves and supplying equipment, \nconstruction, testing, commissioning, providing as-built drawings and operational manuals, and \ntraining.  This  subcomponent  will  be  implemented  after  a  comprehensive  sewer  condition \nassessment is completed and critical sewer networks are identified and reconfirmed through a \nhydraulic survey by the design, supervision, and management consultants.  \n \n22. \nRehabilitation  of  Marine  Outfalls.  This  subcomponent  will  repair  the  two  marine \noutfalls discharging the sewage collected from each northern and southern catchment, including \n(i) major repairs to the northern outfall, which is currently breached in the middle, (ii) installation \nof  new  diffusers  and  fitting  of  access  covers  at  the  northern  outfall,  (iii)  provision  of  access \npoints  to  the  maintenance  hole  and  unblocking  of  14  outlet  ports  at  the  southern  outfall,  and  \n(iv) cleaning of grit at both outfalls.  \n \nSupply  of  Operational  Equipment.  This  subcomponent  will  provide  operational \n23. \nequipment  to  assist  CMC  to  carry  out  key  O&M  tasks,  including  (i)  clearing  blockages; 25  \n(ii)  sewer  inspection  to  check  structural  conditions,  causes  of  blockages,  infiltration,  illegal \nconnections,  and  interconnection  of  sewer  and  storm  water;26 and  (iii)  routine  maintenance, \nsuch as the removal of deposited sediments as a result of shallow gradients and low flows.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening Institutional and Operational Capacity27  \n\nAsset  Management  Planning  and  Operations.  To  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the \n24. \ncapital  investments,  the  Project  proposes  to  introduce  (i)  a  new  sewerage  management \ninformation  system  that  will  store  all  data  relating  to  sewerage  service  provision  centrally;  \n(ii)  an  associated  asset  management  and  stock  inventory  system,  including  a  database  with \nregular updates on the condition of the assets;28 and (iii) a work planning system that enables \nthe  planned  maintenance  of  the  sewerage  assets  using  the  recorded  asset  database.  These \nchanges will be best effected if the management and the operation functions are separated, with \nappropriate checks and balances. The Project will support the introduction and implementation \nof these changes in CMC\u2019s wastewater management system and will assist CMC to establish a \nseparate management unit apart from the existing operational unit.29  \n \n25. \nTo  support  asset  management  planning  and  establish  a  well-prioritized  capital \ninvestment  program  in  the  project  area,  the  Project  will  also  support  the  preparation  of  a \nstrategic sewer network model30 and an update of the wastewater master plan.31 This plan will \n\n                                                 \n24  Fine screens, washing facilities and digesters will be installed in the Madampitiya and Wellawatta pumping stations \nto ensure removal of all suspended particulate matter of size 3 mm and above, subject to verification of their design \nby the design, supervision, and management consultants and endorsement by CMC and ADB. \n\n25 A mobile jetting and vacuum lorry, a jetting trailer, and a bowser lorry will be provided to clear blockages. \n26 A mobile CCTV sewer inspection unit will be provided. \n27 Component  2  targets  strengthening  CMC\u2019s  institutional  and  operational  capacity,  as  asset  owner  and  service \nprovider  for  main  sewerage  system  in  Colombo.  The  subcomponents  are  designed  to  address  the  identified \ninstitutional and operational constraints based on the findings from the problem analysis in Appendix 2. \n\n28 The  asset  condition  will  be  regularly  updated  by  the  operational  team  by  encoding  routine  maintenance  records \n\nand CCTV survey results of underground pipes. \n\n29 The existing organizational structure of CMC for sewerage management is focused on operations. Now that CMC \nis  mandated  to  discharge  its  mandate  as  asset  owner  of  the  sewerage  system,  a  separate  unit  dedicated  to \nmanaging the assets will be established with the assistance of an institutional development consultant.  \n\n30  Sewer  network  modeling  includes  (i)  completion  of  Greater  Colombo's  sewers  map  digitization  to  expedite \noperational and maintenance activities; (ii) development of a strategic hydraulic model that will enable identification \n\n\f \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nincorporate  updated  demand  forecasts,  based  on  urbanization  trends  and  the  Colombo \ndevelopment  plan.  It  will  propose  the  required  capacities  in  the  sewerage  system  and  the \ninvestment required to improve the system. The plan will also cover a progressive expansion of \nthe  public  sewerage  system  to  underserved  areas  and  proposals  for  secondary  wastewater \ntreatment in Greater Colombo.32  \n \n26. \nFinancial  Management.  The  Project  will  support  CMC  to  improve  the  financial \nmanagement of sewerage operations with a view to sustaining the operations of the upgraded \nsewerage system. This will include (i) building up and implementing a cost-recovery mechanism \nfollowing a time-bound implementation plan; (ii) creating a dedicated budget line and accounting \ncode  for  sewerage  operations  to  ring-fence  the  fund  flow  and  accounting  related  to  sewerage \nservices;  (iii)  incorporating  financial  planning  into  the  corporate  plan;  and  (iv)  introducing  a \nperformance  budgeting  system  where  the  operational  and  financial  performance  is  monitored \nand reported, and eventually costs and inputs are determined by the target outputs on the basis \nof technical and financial performance indicators. \n \n27. \nOperational  and  Monitoring  Capacity. As part of measures to strengthen operational \ncapacity,  the  Project  will  support  the  drafting  and  implementation  of  standard  operational \npractices, a preventive maintenance plan, a health and safety manual, and an emergency plan. \nThe  Project  will  also  develop  procedures  for  managing  and  monitoring  (i)  illegal  connections,  \n(ii)  flooding  of  properties,  (iii)  sewer  blockages  and  collapses,  (iv)  stores  replenishment,  and  \n(v) energy and environmental auditing.  \n \n28. \nEnvironmental Compliance. The Project will support CMC in monitoring and complying \nwith  environmental  regulatory  standards.  This  will  include  (i)  establishing  a  quality  monitoring \nmechanism  for  discharge  to  inland,  coastal,  and  marine  waters;  (ii)  providing  water  quality \nmonitoring equipment and consumables; (iii) building a mechanism for pollution source control, \nmonitoring,  and  enforcement  of  pretreatment  before  discharging  to  sewer  network;  (iv)  legal \narrangements for interagency sewer discharge;33 (v) preparation of a septage management plan \nfor underserved areas and pumping stations; and (vi) establishing arrangements for processing \nand disposing of sludge and screenings at the pumping stations. \n \n29. \nCustomer  Services  and  Public  Awareness.  The  Project  will  support  CMC  to  build  a \ncustomer database and a customer services manual. To complement active customer relations, \na  framework  will  be  developed  to  assess  the  performance  of  services  delivery  by  CMC.  A \nwastewater  services  outreach  program  will  be  conducted  to  improve  understanding  among \ncustomers and the public. In addition to information on the Project\u2019s components, benefits and \nimplementation  schedule,  the  campaign  will  aim  to  improve  public  awareness  on  (i)  the \nenvironment  and  public  health  in  relation  to  sanitation;  (ii)  the  operational  costs  needed  to \nprovide  a  service  and  associated  service  charges;  (iii)  links  between  water  consumption  and \nwastewater generation; and (iv) the consequences of solid waste disposal into open canals or \nmaintenance  holes.  The  campaign  will  also  provide  an  opportunity  to  disseminate  information \nrelating to customer inquiries and customer support.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nof critical sewers, optimization of the operational regime of the pumps, and an assessment of the risk of silting; and \n(iii) procurement of hardware and software to run a model. \n\n31 A sewerage master plan was first prepared in 1981 and last updated in 1993. \n32 At  present,  a  sewage  treatment  plant  is  being  considered  for  possible  construction  by  2020.  Land  for  future \ntreatment  works  will  be  reserved  near  the  Mutwal  and  Wellawatta  outfalls.  The  Project  will  conduct  feasibility \nstudies  on  the  preferred  treatment  process  and  on  the  preliminary  design  of  the  sewage  treatment  works  at  the \nproposed locations. \n\n33 The  Greater  Colombo  sewerage  system  has  cross-boundary  flows  of  wastewater  at  the  boundaries  between  the \nCMC  and  NWSDB  service  areas,  which  require  an  agreement  between  two  parties.  A  draft  memorandum  of \nunderstanding on interagency sewer discharge is attached in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nin \n\n30. \nPro-poor  and  Gender-inclusive  Sanitation  Services.  Building  on  the  draft  poverty \nreduction strategy developed by CMC, the Project complements and institutionalizes CMC's on-\ngoing  efforts \nIt  will  support  \nits  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services. \n(i)  comprehensive  research  on  previous  and  ongoing  pilot  sanitation  schemes  in  low-income \nareas, and lessons to be drawn from such schemes; (ii) providing inputs to the Greater Colombo \nwastewater master planning from the pro-poor sanitation services perspectives; (iii) setting up a \nstrategy  of  pro-poor  sanitation  services  to  form  part  of  CMC's  poverty  reduction  strategy  and \ninstitutionalizing  the  implementation  of  such  strategy;  (iv)  preparing  a  proposal  on  future \ninvestment requirements in accordance with the strategy; (v) recording underserved settlements \ndata into the current geographic information system database; and (vi) piloting alternative and \nunconventional on-site sanitation in selected low-income areas.34 \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Project Management and Implementation Support  \n\n31. \nThis  component  will  support  project  management  and  implementation,  including \nincremental administration and operations associated with the project management unit (PMU) \nand  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  and  implementation  of  the  capacity  development \nprogram.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  the  PMU  for  the  design  and  supervision  of \nsewerage infrastructure works, including a preliminary design for future treatment plants and an \nexpansion  of  the  sewerage  system  to  underserved  areas.  Support  will  also  be  provided  in \nproject  management  and  implementation  on  technical,  environmental  and  social  aspects  and \nplanning and monitoring in accordance with ADB policy and guidelines.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nSustainability  Embedded  in  the  Contract.  The  Project  provides  a  large  capital \n32. \ninvestment  and  it  is  essential  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  this  investment.  In  parallel  with \ninstitutional  and  operational  support  for  CMC,  the  Project  proposes  a  consolidated  contract \ncombining  design,  construction  and  O&M.  The  merits  of  this  consolidated    contract  are  to  \n(i)  provide  incentives  to  the  contractor  to  take  an  integrated  approach  in  the  system\u2019s  design, \nincluding consideration of O&M; (ii) indirectly enhance the quality of construction by extending \nthe contractor's responsibility beyond the commissioning stage; (iii) provide continuity in system \noperation while the construction is ongoing; (iv) increase the predictability of the system in terms \nof technical and budgetary requirements; (v) involve CMC staff for a sufficient transition period \nbefore  they  take  full  responsibility;  and  (vi)  secure  an  adequate  O&M  budget  based  on \ncontractual  requirements.  The  key  features  of  the  contract  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C and the outline structure is summarized in Appendix 5. \n \nD. \n \n33. \n$16.5 million.

The  OCR  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  (the \ninterest  and  fee  during  the  grace  period  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADF loan will have a 32-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period.  The  ADF  loan  will  finance  part  of \nsewerage infrastructure upgrading, sewerage master planning including an investment plan for \nan expansion of sewerage to underserved areas, institutional capacity strengthening support for \nservice delivery and project management support, and CMC\u2019s institutionalization of its pro-poor \nsanitation  services  in  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  pilot  schemes. 35  The  Government \ncounterpart  funds  will  finance  the  full  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  and  the  temporary \nresettlement cost.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary Capital Resources \nAsian Development Fund \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n80.0  \n20.0  \n16.6  \n116.6  \n\n% \n\n \n68.6  \n17.1  \n14.3a  \n100.0  \n\na     The Government's share of the cost is in line with the country cost sharing ceiling.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n35 While the Project is entitled to larger amount of ADF loan considering its non-revenue generating aspects and its \nimpact  on  the  environment  and  public  health,  the  proportion  of  the  ADF  loan  is  set  relatively  low  because  of  the \nfinancial  constraints  facing  ADF  resources.

CMC  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  most  activities,  except  for  the \npumping station rehabilitation works within the NWSDB service area,36 for which NWSDB will be \nthe implementing agency. The PMU will be established within CMC directly under the municipal \ncommissioner, led by a CMC officer at senior management level for the duration of the Project. \nA small PIU will be established under NWSDB to implement the works for the NWSDB service \narea.  The  PMU  will  be  staffed  by  members  of  CMC,  together  with  staff  to  be  recruited  on  a \ncontract basis. The staffing requirements for the PMU will consider both incremental staff for the \nimplementation  and  construction  phases  and  the  long-term  O&M  function  of  CMC.  The \nGovernment, CMC, and NWSDB have agreed to provide adequate staff for the PMU and PIU, \nwhich  should  be  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  order  to  help  CMC  to  set  up  the  PMU  structure  and \nmanage the preparatory works for Project implementation, a project management support team \nwill  be  engaged,  funded  by  ADB  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (CDTA). 37 The \nCDTA will support project preparatory activities and initial training and capacity building of CMC \nto improve Project readiness and kick-start project implementation immediately after the Project \nbecomes effective.  \n \n37. \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  Project  and \nprovide  policy  guidance  and  coordination  among  the  Government  agencies  involved  in  the \nadministrative process of the Project. 38 The PSC, chaired by the secretary of MLGPC, will hold \nquarterly meetings, or as often as necessary.  \n \n38. \nThe  PMU  will  have  four  different  units:  (i)  engineering,  (ii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  \n(iii)  institutional  development,  and  (iv)  finance  and  administration.39 The  key  functions  of  the \nPMU will be (i) preparing the overall project implementation plan and consolidated annual work \nplan;  (ii)  recruiting  consultants  and  procuring  goods  and  works,  in  compliance  with  ADB \nguidelines; (iii) implementing the proposed institutional strengthening and capacity development \nprogram  under  the  Project;  (iv)  carrying  out  project  performance  and  compliance  monitoring, \nincluding  loan  covenants  and  safeguards  compliance;  (v)  administering  the  ADB  loan  in \naccordance  with  ADB  disbursement  guidelines;  (vi)  maintaining  project  documents  and \nsubmitting  timely  reports  to  ADB  and  the  Government,  including  audit  reports;  (vii)  obtaining \nnecessary  environmental  and  developmental  clearances;  and  (viii)  disclosing  project-related \ninformation  and  documents  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.

Implementation is expected to begin in the \nfirst  quarter  of  2010  and  end  in  December  2014.  To  prepare  for  project  implementation,  the \nPMU  has  been  formed  with  a  core  staff.  In  addition,  following  start-up  activities  have  been \ncompleted: (i) forming the PSC, and (ii) placing an advertisement inviting expressions of interest \nfrom the consultants. Other activities such as (i) establishing a fully functional PMU in the form \nof legalized independent project office; (ii) applying for permits, clearances, and approvals from \nvarious  competent  authorities;  (iii)  carrying  out  technical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  for \nwastewater services; and (iv) developing the capacity of the PMU staff will be undertaken before \nloan  effectiveness.  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  completed  before  the  third  quarter  of \n2010. Tendering of major civil works will begin 3 months after the consultants\u2019 mobilization and \nphysical  works  will  start  approximately  15  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nCivil Works and Goods. Procurements to be financed by the Project will be carried out \n40. \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated to \ncost  $3  million  or  more,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  higher.  Shopping  will  be \nused  for  contracts  for  procurement  of  works  and  equipment  worth  less  than  $100,000.  An \nindicative  procurement  plan,  indicating  contract  packages  and  procurement  program,  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \nThe size of procurement packages will depend on the nature of the works involved, on \n41. \nenabling  reasonable  competition  in  the  bidding,  and  on  minimizing  the  PMU's  contract \nadministration and management burden. The Project proposes a design\u2013build\u2013operate contract \nfor  the  main  sewerage  system  rehabilitation  works  in  order  to  ensure  an  integrated  system \ndesign  and  sustained  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  system.  The  procurement  plan  will  be \nupdated annually by the PMU for approval by ADB. \n \n42. \nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. Advance contracting of equipment, \nworks  and  recruitment  of  consultants  is  requested.  The  expenditures  incurred  for  equipment, \nworks, and consulting services during the 12 months prior to signing of the loan agreements will \nbe eligible for retroactive financing of up to 20% of the proposed amount for the loans under the \nProject. In order to expedite project implementation, it is proposed that advance action be taken \nfor  (i)  recruitment  of  consultants;  (ii)  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for  procurement  of  the \ndesign\u2013build\u2013operate  contract  package,  the  technical  specifications  of  which  will  be  upgraded \nby  the  consultants  once  they  are  mobilized;  (iii)  conduct  of  preliminary  surveys  and \ninvestigations; (iv) procurement of operational equipment; and (v) establishment and operation \nof the PMU and PIU offices and capacity building of newly recruited staff. The Government has \nbeen  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.    \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n43. \nAn estimated 1,007 person-months (77 international, 930 national) of consulting services \nare  required  to  (i)  facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\ninstitutional  and  operational  capacity  of  CMC.  The  PMU  will  recruit  two  consulting  firms:  a \ndesign,  supervision,  and  management  consultant  (DSC)  and  an  institutional  development \nconsultant  (IDC).  The  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection (QCBS) method with a standard quality:cost ratio of 80:20 in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  DSC  will \ninclude  53  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  736  person-months  of  national \nexpertise.40 The  IDC  will  include  24  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  194  person-\nmonths  of  national  expertise.41 The  proposed  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  DSC  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix E and the outline terms of reference for the IDC are in Supplementary \nAppendix  F.  Nongovernment  organizations  will  also  be  recruited  under  the  Project  to  support \nthe implementation of public awareness and community mobilization activities.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy will be included in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing and implementing \nagencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  introduce  additional  specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and \n45. \ntransparency in relation to the Project implementation. These include (i) provision of consultant \nsupport to project implementation staff on procurement and financial management; (ii) support \nfor \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency;  \n(iii)  implementation  of  procurement  and  performance  audits;  (iv)  computerization  of  a  financial \nreporting system and its networking among cost centers; (v) adherence to a code of conduct by \nmanagement and employees; (vi) random and independent spot checks by review missions on \nprocurement  and  project  accounts;  (vii)  public  disclosure  of  information  on  procurement \nprocedures and contract awards for the Project through the website of implementing agencies; \n(viii) institutionalization of a mechanism to redress grievances; and (ix) beneficiary involvement \nin project monitoring and evaluation.    \n \n\ninformation \n\ntechnology \n\nincrease \n\nto \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n46. \nThe PMU and PIU will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections, requesting \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  preparing \nwithdrawal applications and sending them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan \nproceeds  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  the \nloans are made effective, open and maintain three first-generation imprest accounts, one for the \nOCR loan and two for the ADF loan, with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the three second- \ngeneration imprest accounts, two for the PMU (one for the OCR loan and one for the ADF loan) \nand  one  for  the  PIU  from  ADF  loan.  The  maximum  ceiling  of  each  first-generation  imprest \naccount will not at any time exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures to be paid from \nthe imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the respective loan amount from OCR and \n\n                                                 \n40  In addition, about 1,088 person-months of technical and support staff will also be engaged under the DSC. \n41  In addition, about 100 person-months of technical and support staff will also be engaged under the IDC. \n\n\f \n\n        \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nADF, whichever is lower. The maximum ceiling of each second-generation imprest account will \nbe  equivalent  to  6  months  estimated  expenditures  to  be  funded  from  each  second-generation \nimprest  account  or  $1,000,000,  whichever  is  lower.  The  PMU  and  PIU  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring  that  all  imprest  accounts  are  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  with  the  detailed  arrangements \nagreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures  will \nbe  used  to  liquidate  advances  from  the  imprest  accounts.  The  maximum  payment  permitted \nunder the SOE for both second-generation imprest accounts is $100,000 per payment. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n47. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  detailed  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation, which will follow ADB's standard template and procedures. The PMU and PIU \nwill  maintain  separate  project  accounts  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  Project,  whether \nfunded  out  of  loan  proceeds  or  counterpart  funds.  They  will  establish  and  maintain  separate \nrecords for works, goods, and services financed out of loan proceeds.  \n \nThe Government and the MLGPC will cause the detailed consolidated project accounts, \n48. \nas  maintained  by  the  PMU  and  PIU,  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nstandards  by  the  auditor  general  or  independent  auditors  appointed  by  the  auditor  general \nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof  the  fiscal  year  by  the  PMU  and  PIU.  The  annual  audit  report  will  include  a  separate  audit \nopinion on the use of the first-generation and second-generation imprest accounts and the SOE \nprocedure.  The  Government  and  the  MLGPC  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ndelayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited \naccounts. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nTo  ensure  that  project  components  are  managed  efficiently  and  project  benefits  are \n49. \nmaximized, the PMU, with support and coordination by PIU, will establish a project performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) within 3 months of loan effectiveness. The PPMS, established in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook,  will  provide  a \ncause-and-effect  relationship  between  the  Project  and  its  impact  and  will  be  updated  and \nreported quarterly. Project performance monitoring and evaluation will be based on the design \nand monitoring framework and the baseline surveys specified in it. Beneficiaries will be involved \nin project monitoring evaluation, through direct reporting to the PMU and PIU and through the \nPSC.  The  indicators  to  be  monitored  will  be  formulated  by  the  PMU  and  PIU,  including \nindicators pertaining to physical progress and institutional development activities. A separate set \nof performance indicators will be established for the design\u2013build\u2013operate contract for contract \nmonitoring. The PMU and PIU will gather baseline physical and socioeconomic data and submit \nfor  monitoring  performance  and  preparing  benchmark \na  detailed \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, \nthe PMU and PIU will submit semiannual monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB throughout \nproject implementation. \n \n\nimplementation  plan \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n50. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly assess project implementation semiannually. The \nGovernment,  MLGPC,  PMU,  PIU,  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  3 \nyears  after  the  Project  starts  or  after  construction  of  the  main  package  for  sewerage \nrehabilitation  has  been  initiated,  whichever  is  sooner.  The  reviews  will  (i)  examine  the \nappropriateness  of  scope,  design,  implementation  arrangements  and  schedule  of  activities;  \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n(ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance \nagainst  project  indicators;  (iv)  review  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (v)  identify  problems, \nconstraints,  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements; and (vi) monitor the effectiveness of safeguard procedures. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  make  publicly  available  a  project  completion \nreport  (PCR)  in  the  standard  ADB  format.  ADB  will  prepare  its  own  PCR  within  1  year  of \nreceiving the Government\u2019s PCR. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n51. \nEconomic. Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth is largely dependent on Colombo and its ability \nto  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity.  Adequate  provision  of  urban  services  in \nColombo  is  one  of  the  important  elements  for  ensuring  further  investment  and  productivity. \nDespite  rapid  urbanization,  the  existing  sewerage  network  in  Greater  Colombo  is  limited,  and \nneeds to be expanded. However, no system expansion works can be undertaken unless critical \ndefects  are  repaired  and  higher  operational  efficiency  is  attained  within  the  existing  system. \nTherefore, the Project is focused on rehabilitating the existing sewerage system in preparation \nfor  the  future  expansion  of  the  public  sewerage  system  to  areas  in  Greater  Colombo  not  yet \nserved. Alternative designs for rehabilitation were assessed during the feasibility study stage.42 \nThe technologies that were selected meet geographical restrictions, will be easy to maintain and \noperate, and will have low construction and maintenance costs.  \n \n52. \nThe Project is the first phase of large scheme that ultimately aims to expand sewerage \ncoverage in Greater Colombo. The Project's economic viability considered the future expansion \nof  the  sewerage  system.  The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  covers  a  25-year  period  and  uses  2009 \ndomestic prices. The result of the cost\u2013benefit analysis indicates that the economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  is  13.6%,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  indicating  the \nreasonable  economic  viability  of  the  Project.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  undertaken  under \nvarious  adverse  circumstances.  The  result  indicates  that  the  EIRR  is  most  sensitive  to  the \nnumber  of  connections  achieved.  CMC  and  NWSDB  will  therefore  need  to  ensure  the \nsubsequent  expansion  of  the  Project  to  achieve  the  target  number  of  connections.  The \neconomic analysis is detailed in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nFinancial.  The  financial  management  assessment43 reveals  that  there  is  potential  for \n53. \nboth  CMC  and  NWSDB  to  strengthen  their  financial  management.  Both  organizations  suffer \nfrom vacancies in finance staff positions, which have affected timely completion of the accounts. \nTheir  corporate  planning  is  separate  from  financial  planning.  There  are  challenges  specific  to \neach organization. As the Project is the first large-scale project for CMC, its existing accounting \npractices may require modification,44 such as the introduction of depreciation to prepare for the \nreplacement of large capital assets, treatment of uncollectable payments, and a new accounts \ncode  to  capture  the  fund  flow  related  exclusively  to  sewerage  services.  NWSDB  needs  to \nincrease  efficiency  in  various  areas.  For  example,  financial  reports  from  various  regions  are \n\n                                                 \n42 Alternative materials and excavation techniques were considered, such as use of ductile iron pipes or polyethylene \npipes, laid by open trench or using trenchless technology. Various sewer network configurations and locations of \nthe screening facilities were evaluated to achieve higher efficiency in light of practicalities for the required process. \nThe detailed analysis of alternative designs is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n43 Financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  as  part  of  financial  analysis,  as  detailed  in  Supplementary \n\nAppendix H. \n\n44 This will be subject to further assessment of capacity and required procedures for implementation. The institutional \ndevelopment  consultant  will  support  the  implementation  of  suggestions  to  the  extent  that  the  current  accounting \nstandards can accommodate them. \n\n\f \n\n        \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nmanually consolidated because there is no networked financial reporting system, and accounts \nreceivables are higher than the three-month sales because of low tariff collection.  \n \n54. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  was  assessed  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.45 As  the  Project  is  a  nonrevenue  generating \nproject, it is not appropriate to assess financial rate of return; instead the financial sustainability \nof the Project was assessed. With no incremental revenue from the Project, CMC and NWSDB \nwill  have  to  finance  their  debt  service  and  higher  O&M  costs  from  their  existing  revenues. \nCMC's  revenue  needs  to  be  increased  by  SLRs370  million  in  real  terms  by  2014  to  finance \nO&M and debt servicing costs.46 Revenue increases will be able to finance both the debt service \nand  the  O&M  cost  from  2015.  NWSDB  will  have  to  increase  the  service  charges  by  not  less \nthan 3.5% per year in real terms. The financial analysis is detailed in Supplementary Appendix \nH. \n \n55. \nPoverty  Impact.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  the  sewerage  infrastructure  and \nmanagement  services,  which  will  contribute  to  achieving  MDG  target  7.  The  public  health \nimpacts from the reduction of overflows, leaks and blockages will benefit the poor who often live \nin low-lying areas and near polluted inland waterways in Colombo. The Project also includes a \nsubcomponent \nin \nunderserved  settlements  in  the  CMC  service  area,  and  to  pilot  alternative  and  unconventional \non-site  sanitation  in  underserved  areas.  This  will  involve:  (i)  carrying  out  a  participatory \nconsultative  process  with  beneficiaries  to  identify  the  most  appropriate  alternative  sanitation \ntechnology; (ii) identifying the potential for community participation in implementation, operation, \nand  maintenance  of  the  sanitation  facility;  and  (iii)  assessing  the  possibility  of  extending  the \npiloted approach to other municipal areas. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 10.   \n \nB. \n\ninstitutionalize  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\nto \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with \n56. \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Infrastructure works under the Project are limited \nto upgrading existing sewerage infrastructure within existing physical facilities. For rehabilitating \ngravity sewers, the construction will be undertaken through trenchless technology or open-cut.47 \nIn road alignments with four or more lanes, traffic can be managed to ensure that works will not \nresult  in  temporary  loss  of  access.  For  two-lane  roads,  there  may  be  potential  temporary \nimpacts related to access disruptions.48 The potential temporary impacts of open cuts would be \naccess  disruption \n(iii)  vehicles,  and  \n(iv) institutions and clients. This disruption can be mitigated through good construction practices, \nwhich will be the responsibility of the construction contractors. In road alignments with no proper \naccess, there is a likelihood of temporary income loss for businesses and their employees. \n \nThe Project will not require permanent or temporary land acquisition. Based on transect \n57. \nwalks  and  confirmation  from  project  preparation  civil  engineers,  there  will  be  no  impacts  on \npermanent structures or other assets. While it is estimated that there would be potential impacts \nfor an estimated 156 residential households in terms of access inconvenience, interviews show \n\n(ii)  businesses  and  clients, \n\nresidents, \n\nfor: \n\n(i) \n\n                                                 \n45 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n46 This can be a combined way of revising the annual rental value and increasing the property tax rate. \n47  The  choice  of  technology  will  depend  on  a  conditions  survey,  which  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the  Project. \nTrenchless technology will not have resettlement impacts, thus, as a conservative approach, the resettlement plan \nassumes that most sections will use open cut. \n\n48 Transect  walks  were conducted on two road sections totaling 1.25 km. During the transect  walks, interview  were \ncarried  out  with  residents,  businesses,  employees,  and  institutions,  supplemented  by  focus  group  discussions  to \nestimate potential temporary impacts. \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nthat  residents'  livelihood  will  not  be affected  except  when  their  businesses  or  employment  are \naffected  by  access.  Residents  may  temporarily  lose  secure  parking  for  an  estimated  515 \nvehicles and businesses for 480 vehicles. An estimated 428 businesses and 1,340 employees \nmay experience partial income loss because of reduced client access.49 There is much potential \nto minimize impacts, through proper planning and implementation of mitigation measures, to a \nlevel that will not affect income. A summary short resettlement plan is attached in Appendix 11 \nand the short resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n58. \nIndigenous  Peoples.  Screening  during  project  preparation  showed  no  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples.  The  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan  also  shows  that  there  are  no \nindigenous  peoples  among  the  affected  people.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  C  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nEnvironment.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n59. \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  for  the  project  subcomponents  in  the  project \narea. The examination showed that none of the components would have any significant adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  all  impacts  could  be  suitably  mitigated.  The  only  subcomponent \nrequiring  greater  attention  is  the  continuous  discharge  of  domestic  wastewater  to  the  marine \nenvironment. However, numerous modeling studies have indicated good mixing, dispersion, and \ncoliform  die-off  under  most  weather  and  tide  conditions  for  both  rehabilitated  outfalls.  The \nrehabilitation  of  the  outfalls  to,  at  least,  their  design  specifications  would  be  a  considerable \nimprovement  on  the  existing  situation.  Anticipated  minor  environmental  impacts  include  some \nexcess soil generation due to excavation activities50 and greater noise, dust, and traffic during \nconstruction. 51  The  short  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  12  and  the  summary  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. An environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared as part of \nthe IEE (Supplementary Appendix K) for the construction and operation phases, with adequate \nmitigation  measures  proposed  to  minimize  impacts  resulting  from  inadequate  maintenance  of \nsewerage  network.  Significant  environmental  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  include  \n(i)  improved  hygiene  and  sanitary  conditions,  (ii)  better  sewage  disposal,  and  (iii)  a  healthier \necosystem as a result of the reduction in the discharge of domestic wastes into surface water \nbodies.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n60. \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  risks  are  (i)  a  start-up  delay  and  slow  Project  implementation \nbecause  of  the  limited  experience  of  CMC  in  implementing  an  ADB  project  of  this  scale,  and  \n(ii) a possible lack of sustainability in recovering the cost of O&M and debt services.  \n \n61. \nThe  risk  of  a  start-up  delay  and  slow  Project  implementation  will  be  mitigated  by  the \nearly  establishment  of  the  PMU  and  the  recruitment  of  qualified  staff  supported  by  the \nconsultants.  The  CDTA  will  provide  upfront  support  to  prepare  for  project  implementation, \n\n                                                 \n49 One  pipe  section  is  20  m  long  requiring  a  trench  1.5  m  wide.  By  opening  the  trench  one  section  at  a  time,  the \n\ndisruption is estimated to be 5 days per 20 m section. \n\n50 Appropriate  controls  include  clauses  on  the  contractor\u2019s  contract  for  criteria  on  predetermining  areas  prior  to \nexcavation works, approving, and monitoring users of the excess spoil. The use should be limited for reclamation \npurposes,  and  should  not  be  used  in  areas  near  wetlands  or  protected  bodies  of  water.  The  IEE  identifies \nmeasures to reduce potential negative impact in relation to the excavation works and transportation of soils.   \n\n51  Measures  are  identified  in  the  IEE  and  include:  (i)  avoiding  conducting  noise-generating  activities  at  night;   \n(ii) consulting with the local community to inform them of the nature, duration, and likely effects of the construction \nwork,  and  to  identify  any  local  concerns  so  that  these  can  be  addressed;  (iii)  reducing  dust  by  spraying  soil  and \ncovering  with  tarpaulins;  and  (iv)  utilizing  modern  vehicles  and  machinery  with  the  requisite  adaptations  to  limit \nnoise and exhaust emissions, and ensuring that these are maintained to manufacturers\u2019 specifications at all times. \n\n\f \n\n        \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nprovide  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  with  exposure  to  ADB  procedures,  and \nsupport the recruitment of the consultants.  \n \n62. \nThe  sustainability  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  a  combination  of  measures.  The  Project \nintroduces  a  design\u2013build\u2013operate  contract  that  will  increase  the  predictability  of  the  technical \nand  budgetary  requirements,  helping  CMC  to  put  in  place  the  necessary  O&M  budget  in  a \nplanned manner. The Project also supports CMC to strengthen its institutional, operational, and \nfinancial  capacity,  including  (i)  building  up  and  implementing  a  cost-recovery  mechanism;  \n(ii)  introducing  an  asset  management  system;  (iii)  implementing  a  performance  budgeting \nsystem;  (iv)  creating  a  dedicated  accounting  code  and  an  exclusive  budget  line  for  sewerage \noperations;  and  (v)  institutionalizing  a  customer  database  and  services,  all  of  which  will \ncontribute  to  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  wastewater  services  delivery.  However,  as  the \nfinancial sustainability of the Project assumes a fundamental increase in revenue from property \ntax or other revenue sources, an assurance is given by the Government and the implementing \nagencies that they will target a revenue increase to achieve the cost recovery. This will need to \nbe backed by sustained political will.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n63. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances have been given by the \nGovernment,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Provincial  Councils,  Colombo  Municipal \nCouncil,  and  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board.  These  assurances  will  be \nincorporated in the loan agreements and project agreements: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that each year during Project implementation, adequate \nbudgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds will be made to the Project by \nthe relevant authorities on a timely and regular basis. \nThe Government will ensure that: (a) all land and right-of-way required for the Project \nare  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (b)  if  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement \nbecomes  necessary,  appropriate  resettlement  plan  is  prepared  in  consultation  with \nthe  affected  people  and  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  National  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  and  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  (c)  the \nresettlement  activities  will  be  carried  out  according  to  the  resettlement  plan  agreed \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  ADB  which  the  Government  will  disclose  to  the \npublic; (d) an updated resettlement plan, to be disclosed to the public, will be provided \nto  ADB  for  review,  approval  and  ADB  website  disclosure  following  detailed  designs \nand detailed measurement survey and prior to the award of any civil works contract; \n(e) any civil works will be commenced only after the required land has been acquired \nand  affected  households  have  been  relocated  and  compensated  at  full  replacement \ncost; (f) external monitoring reports are submitted to ADB to be uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite; (g) adequate budgetary support is made available to cover the costs of land \nacquisition and resettlement; and (h) resettlement activities will be carried out in line \nwith the Government's laws and ADB's policy and in case of discrepancy ADB's policy \nwill be applied. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  Project  is  carried  out  in  compliance  with \nlaws  and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  relevant  national  environmental \nregulations; (b) the relevant environmental mitigation measures specified in the ADB-\napproved  final  EMP  updated  during  detailed  engineering  design  are  incorporated  in \nbidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts;  (c)  all  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements set out in the EMP will be implemented and complied with, \nrespectively,  and  closely  supervised  throughout  Project  implementation;  and  (d) \nproject environmental performance will be monitored, and the monitoring report will be \nsubmitted to ADB semiannually. \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that (a) bidding documents include specific provisions to \nensure  that  civil  works  contractors  will  comply  with  core  labor  standards  and  labor \nlaws  and  gender  equal  pay  for  equal  work,  and  (b)  civil  works  contractors  will \ndisseminate information on sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS to their \nemployees and local communities surrounding the Project sites. \nThe Government confirms that the sewerage asset within Colombo municipal area is \nowned by the CMC and the Government undertakes not to change the ownership of \nthe  asset  throughout  the  Project  period  by  executive  or  administrative  decree, \ndecision, resolution or such other or similar means either under the NWSDB Law or \nsuch other similar, or succeeding legislation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  by  2014  CMC  will  have  effected  the  revenue \nincrease to the level to cover the O&M cost and debt service owed to the Government \nunder  the  Project  and  allocated  such  increased  revenue  for  the  O&M  budget  for \nsewerage operations in CMC service area. Similarly the Government will ensure that \nthe sewerage tariff for the NWSDB will have been increased to cover the O&M cost \nand debt service owed to the Government under the Project by the end of 2014. \nThe  Government  and  CMC  will  ensure  that  adequate  land  has  been  allocated  and \nretained for secondary wastewater treatment facilities with total capacity of 420 million \nliters per day throughout Project implementation. \n\n(viii)  Within  1  year  from  the  loan  effectiveness,  the  following  actions  will  have  been \ncompleted  by  CMC:  (a)  establishment  of  a  separate  cost  center  exclusively  for \nsewerage  operation  and  maintenance,  (b)  assigning  new  account  code  for  an \nindependent sewerage program, and (c) creation of a new budget line exclusively for \nsewerage as part of CMC's budget. \n\n(ix)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  CMC  will  have  introduced  financial  and \noperational  performance  indicators  and  based  on  those  indicators  introduced  a \nperformance-based budgetary system. \n\n(x)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  CMC,  with  the  objective  of  complying  with  CEA \nenvironmental regulations, will have established an environmental monitoring unit with \nsuch experts as may be reasonably necessary with the responsibility to implement the \nwater quality monitoring system for CMC service area. \n\n(xi)  Within  2  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  CMC  and  CEA  will  have  installed  and \noperationalized a discharge-into-sewers pollution source control program, acceptable \nto  ADB,  for  tracking  non-compliant  parties  as  defined  in  the  CEA  regulation;  and \nwithin  1  year  of  such  operationalization,  CMC  and  CEA  will  enforce  a  penalty \nmechanism, acceptable to ADB, for the non-compliant parties. \n\n(xii)  Within 2 year of loan effectiveness, CMC will have prepared a septage management \nplan  dealing  with  the  disposal  of  residual  solids  and  sludge  from  septic  tanks, \nscreens, and grits. \n\n(xiii)  Within  3  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  and  CMC  provides  investment \nplans and implementation programs for (a) storm water drainage system, and (b) solid \nwaste management.  \n\n(xv) \n\n(xiv)  Before award of any contract, clearance of permits, approvals and authorizations will \nhave been obtained from relevant authorities, including CEA and Coast Conservation \nDepartment. \nBefore award of the contract for the rehabilitation of Muttwal and Wellawata outfalls, \nCMC  and  the  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  an  authorization  from  the  Sri  Lanka \nPorts  Authority  has  been  granted  for  sea  outfalls  works,  and  (b)  clearance  from  the \nCoast Conservation Department has been obtained for the temporary use of available \nlands in the vicinity of the sea outfalls. \n\n(xvi)  Before  award  of  the  contract  for  refurbishment  of  pumping  stations  by  CMC,  the \nGovernment  and  CMC  will  ensure  that  security  clearance  has  been  provided  to  the \ncontractor to conduct Pollwatta pumping station rehabilitation works. \n\n\f        \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n64. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\nthe loan of $80,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nGreater Colombo Wastewater Management Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years;  \nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 12,760,000 \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Greater  Colombo \nWastewater Management Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years; \nand \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those \nset forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n7 September 2009 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nC.

Specific  goals 1 include  (i)  provision  of \nsufficient and safe drinking water to 90% of the population by 2016; (ii) achievement of national \nstandards  for  service  levels  and  quality  of  water  in  urban  and  rural  areas;  (iii)  provision  of \naccess  to  safe,  adequate  and  improved  sanitation  facilities  to  88%  of  the  population  by  2016; \n(iv) provision of piped sewerage systems in major urban areas and selected growth centers; and \n(v)  availability  of  standard  on-site  sanitation  for  all  not  currently  connected  to  a  sewerage \nsystem  or  sanitation  scheme.  The  existing  scheme  in  Colombo  has  several  deficiencies  in \nservice  provision,  due  partly  to  physical  constraints,  but  more  importantly  to  financial \nshortcomings,  problematic  operations,  poor  asset  management,  and  policy  and  institutional \nissues. \n \nB. \n\nAccess to Sewerage and Sanitation \n\n2. \nProvision of sewerage services in Sri Lanka is limited to some areas of Greater Colombo \nand  Hikkaduwa  and  covers  about  3%  of  the  total  population.  The  Government  has  proposed \nthat  services  be  expanded  in  Colombo,  Kandy  and  Jaffna.  The  1993  master  plan2 estimated \nthat 66% of the Greater Colombo population was served by on-site sanitation facilities,3 19% by \nsewerage systems,4 and 15% had no facilities. The population without facilities, the urban poor, \ndisposes  of  their  waste  on  the  seashore,  in  canals  and  waterways  and  on  available  open \nground.  In  addition  to  the  15%  without  facilities  there  are  substantial  low-income  settlements \nthat have access to limited facilities.  \n \nC. \n\nPolicy and Institutions  \n\nResponsibility for policy making, regulation and development of the water and sewerage \n3. \nsector lies with the central government (Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the Ministry \nof  Urban  Development  and  Sacred  Areas),  while  provincial  councils  and  local  authorities  are \nresponsible for  ensuring  equitable  resource  allocation,  quality,  and  standards  of  service  under \nthe National Policy on Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector. Before 1975, the provision of \npiped water and public wells was mainly the responsibility of local authorities. In 1974, through \nan act of Parliament, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) was established \nas  the  primary  national  agency  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Subsequently \nseveral major urban water supply schemes were transferred from local authorities to NWSDB in \norder  to  improve  coverage  and  service.  NWSDB,  provincial  councils,  urban  and  municipal \ncouncils, and pradeshiya sabhas have a mandate to provide water and sanitation services. The \nColombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  is  the  only  municipal  council  in  Sri  Lanka  to  provide \ncomprehensive  sewerage  and  sanitation  services  within  its  jurisdiction.  It  is  envisaged  that \nKandy  Municipal  Council  will  offer  sewerage  services  in  the  near  future.  Private  sector \nparticipation in the water and sanitation sector is limited and is mostly in the form  of (i) small-\n\n                                                 \n1   Department  of  National  Planning.  2006.

Target indicators differ depending on sources. \n\n2   Engineering Science. 1993. Wastewater Master Plan for Greater Colombo. Colombo.  \n3   These have previously defined to include (i) apparently self contained (within the premises that it serves) systems, \n\n(ii) holding tanks, and (iii) facilities which fall between the former. \n\n4   It  is  estimated  that  the  coverage  of  public  sewerage  system  had  expanded  to  around  25%  of  total  population  in \n\nGreater Colombo by 2007. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nRegulation.  Regulators  are  generally  responsible \n\nscale  providers  supplying  drinking  water  to  households,  and  (ii)  civil  work  providers  where \nselected functions have been outsourced.  \n \n4. \nPolicies. A draft Water Supply and Sanitation Policy was formulated in 2002 to provide \nguidance  to  NWSDB,  provincial  councils,  local  authorities,  lending  institutions,  community-\nbased  organizations  (CBOs),  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  involved  in  delivering \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  services.  It  included  investment  strategies  to  achieve  coverage, \nservice  quality  and  cost  recovery  objectives.  A  cabinet  paper  has  been  under  revision  since \nApril  2004,  when  NWSDB  was  asked  to  bring  it  into  line  with  new  Government  investment \nstrategies. Separate water and sanitation policies have since been prepared. NWSBD\u2019s Board \nhas approved the draft sanitation policy, but approval by cabinet is still pending.  \n \n5. \nfor  monitoring  and  enforcing  \ndischarge licenses and fees and service quality and for setting affordable and efficient tariffs. In \nthe  case  of  Sri  Lanka,  two  main  bodies  have  been  given  responsibilities.  The  Public  Utilities \nCommission  (PUC)  was  created  by  Parliament  in  late  2002  to  regulate  water,  electricity,  and \nports. Although commissioners were appointed soon after its establishment, it is not carrying out \nits functions fully, partly because of delays in the formulation and approval of the Water Industry \nAct. The Government is currently reviewing how NWSDB\u2019s operations can be brought into line \nwith the PUC Act to enable the PUC to undertake technical and economic regulation.5  \n \nThe  Central  Environmental  Authority  (CEA)  has  powers  to  enact  laws  and  regulations \n6. \nassociated  with  wastewater  pollution  control  and  discharge  standards.  For  all  Board  of \nInvestment  (BOI)  registered  industries,  the  CEA  has  delegated  its  powers  to  enforce  the \nregulations to the BOI. The pre-treatment standards currently applied to the industries within the \nBOI-owned  processing  zones  are  not  national  standards  but  BOI\u2019s  own  requirements.  The \nimplementation  of  the  CEA  regulations  for  certain  industrial  sectors  can  be  delegated  to  the \nlocal  authorities.  For  industries  such  as  hotels  and  restaurants  in  Colombo,  discharge \ncompliance monitoring and enforcement has been delegated to CMC and is linked to business \nlicense  renewals.  The  Urban  Development  Authority  (UDA)  is  responsible  for  regulation  and  \nguidelines for on-site sanitation. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  In  general,  capital  investment  associated  with  on-site \nfacilities is borne by the developer or owner. There are several programs that provide financial \nhelp  to  the  poor  to  provide  their  own  facilities.  Every  facility  has  to  be  approved  by  local \nauthorities before construction.   \n \n8. \nKey  Legal  and  Environmental  Requirements.  Legal  provisions  relating  to  on-site \nsanitation  facilities  are  comprehensive  and  are  contained  in  several  acts,  ordinances  and \nregulations.6 Under  the  current  regulations,  if  on-site  facilities  are  installed  distant  from  other \nbuildings,  formal  approval  is  not  necessary  and  construction  can  proceed.  Under  the  new \nregulations, the proposed siting of all on-site facilities would require formal approval. \n \n\nInstitutional Framework: On-Site Sanitation \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5   With ADB technical assistance (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \nfor Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Water Supply and Sanitation. Manila), the Government is also in \nthe  process  of  developing  (i)  an  adequate  tariff-setting  methodology,  (ii)  a  customer  code,  and  (iii)  technical \nstandards for water and sewerage services.  \n\n6   They include Nuisance Ordinance, Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance, Town and Country Planning \nOrdinance, Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance, Local Authority Regulations, the UDA Act and the National \nEnvironment Act and Environmental Protection License Regulations. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nFinancial  Requirements.  Free  septage  removal7 is  provided  by  municipalities.  Local \n9. \nauthorities need to consider operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery through collection \nof a reasonable and affordable fee by a private company or the local authority. Both Colombo \nand  Dehiwela/Mt.  Lavinia  municipalities  include  areas  without  sewerage  services  that  rely  on \nseptic tanks. \n \nE. \n\nAreas of Greater Colombo Covered by the Sewerage System \n\n10. \nThe  sewerage  system  in  Greater  Colombo  comprises  about  320  kilometers  of  sewers, \n18  pumping  stations,  and  two  sea  outfalls.  Although  the  initial  sewerage  schemes  in  Greater \nColombo were built between 1906 and 1920, they have been substantially rebuilt and extended \nunder the World Bank and Saudi Fund projects in the 1980s and 1990s. Significant parts of the \nexisting  systems,  including  the  ocean  outfalls,  are  less  than  30  years  old.  There  are  two \nindependent  systems,  each  serving  a  catchment  area,  originally  draining  to  a  treatment  plant. \nThese  treatment  plants  were  both  abandoned  in  1950s:  the  northern  plant  because  of \noperational  problems  and  the  southern  plant  because  of  residents\u2019  complaints  over  nuisance \nand odor. Both are beyond recovery. The northern system discharges through a sea outfall at \nMutwal  (1,500  mm  in  diameter  and  2,053  m  long).  The  Kolonnawa  sewerage  system  in  the \nNWSDB service area is pumped into this northern system and is pumped onward, so it needs to \nbe  operationally  integrated.  The  southern  system  discharges  into  the  outfall  at  Wellawatta \n(1,500  mm  in  diameter  but  1,394  m  long).  The  Dehiwala/Mt  Lavinia  (DMMC)  systems  are \npumped into the southern system but discharge into the Wellawatta junction box and are thus \nlargely independent of the upstream operation of the southern system.  \n \n11. \nService Provision. It is estimated that at present the system serves an area with about \n140,000  households.8 Within  Greater  Colombo,  there  are  a  number  of  areas  with  sewerage \nsystems, including: (i) systems operated by CMC, (ii) systems operated by NWSDB (Kolonnawa \nand DMMC), (iii) systems in industrial processing zones, (iv) housing scheme systems, and (v) \nindividual hospital self-contained systems. There is no formal agreement in place between the \ntwo  organizations  with  regard  to  the  cross-boundary  flows,  or  between  private  owners  and \nNWSDB  and  CMC.  In  addition,  new  industrial  sewage  treatment  plants  and  associated  local \nsewerage  systems  are  currently  being  developed  by  NWSDB  in  Ja-Ela/Ekala  and  Ratmalana. \nWhile CMC and NWSDB own most of the 320 kilometers of sewers, several smaller schemes, \nwhich  ultimately  feed  into  the  main  system,  are  owned  by  government  institutions  (National \nHousing  Development  Authority,  Urban  Development  Authority,  Greater  Colombo  Economic \nDivision, Board of Investment) or private companies (e.g., Ceylinco, Finco, Apollo Hospital). \n \nAsset Ownership. Despite earlier moves to transfer assets9 in Colombo municipality to \n12. \nNWSDB,10 the  attorney  general's  legal  opinion  of  25  September  2007  established  that  in  the \nabsence  of  Parliamentary  approval,  the  assets  remained  under  CMC's  ownership.  However, \n\n                                                 \n7 These  services  generally  include  septic  tank  emptying  using  vacuum  tankers  with  discharge  into  the  sewerage \n\nsystem (one of the pumping stations). \n\n8   While 64,000 households are currently registered in the CMC areas as connected, it is extremely common to find \n\ntwo or more households per connection. Out of these, 80% are domestic and 20% are non-domestic.  \n\n9   This refers to the compulsory transfer of the Colombo Municipal sewerage system by Order published in Gazette \nNo.  71/4  of  16  January  2006  and  the  voluntary  transfer  of  the  sewerage  system  by  Order  published  on  9  May \n1996. \n\n10  At  the  time  when  the  transfer  agreement  was  reached,  an  understanding  was  also  concluded  whereby  NWSDB \nwould  pay  SLRs20  million  a  year  and  CMC  SLRs70  million  a  year  for  the  O&M  costs  of  the  system.  This \nunderstanding  was  recorded  in  NWSDB  Paper  No  S/40/96-496.  However,  this  agreement  was  never  formalized \nwith  an  official  document  signed  by  both  parties.  In  2004,  following  a  letter  from  the  mayor  of  Colombo  to  the \nminister  of  housing  and  plantation  infrastructure  drawing  his  attention  to  the  agreement  on  O&M  costs,  NWSDB \nwas instructed to reimburse CMC the annual amount of SLRs20 million unpaid over the years.  \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nsewerage  assets  covering  parts  of  Kolonnawa  and  DMMC11 are  both  owned  and  operated  by \nNWSDB. New schemes being developed in Ja-Ela/Ekala and Ratmalana are also to be owned \nand operated by NWSDB upon completion of the works. \n \n13. \nCost  Recovery.  In  the  CMC  area,  sewerage  and  sanitation  services  are  provided  as \npart  of  municipal  services  for  which  a  property  tax  is  charged  to  the  residents.  Revenues  for \nsewerage  consist  of  government  grants  and  reimbursements, 12  registration  fees  paid  by \ncontractors and suppliers, administration charges and other miscellaneous income. CMC is on \nthe process of preparing cost recovery plan, including its time-bound action plan to increase the \nrevenue to recover the O&M cost and debt service by 2014.   \n \n14. \nThe  introduction  of  a  sewerage  charge  by  NWSDB  to  recover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs was approved by cabinet in 2002. Subsequently, NWSDB's Board and the \nMWSD minister approved a tariff policy and structure. The notification of the new sewerage tariff \nwas gazetted in October 2007 and billing started in March 2008 for properties connected to the \nsewerage network in DMMC and Kollonawa. The sewerage charge is part of the water bill.  \n \nPlanning  and  Asset  Management.  NWSDB  has  a  corporate  plan  for  2007\u20132011, \n15. \nalthough  it  does  not  have  a  business  plan  with  supporting  financial  projections,  targets  or \nindicators  that  can  be  monitored.  The  annual  budget  is  prepared  over  a  period  of  5  months \nusing  performance-based  budgeting  where  costs  and \nto  match \nperformance  and  outputs.  System  operation  and  maintenance  consists  of  crisis  management \nrather  than  strategic  decisions  based  on  risk  analysis  and  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the \nnetwork, or a holistic approach that considers legal, technical, financial, regulatory, operational, \nand  customer  service  aspects.13 NWSDB  has  acknowledged  that  revisions  to  its  operational \napproach  are  needed  and  is  currently  reviewing  decentralization  of  responsibilities  to  regional \noffices. It is anticipated that this will lead to more rapid and responsive decision making. CMC is \nyet to introduce asset management into its operations. \n \nF. \n \n16. \nCMC's overall financial performance and that of its sewerage operations is described in \nTable  A3.1.  CMC's  capital  expenditure  was  in  excess  of  capital  receipts  in  2004  and  2007. \nThese  deficits  were  adequately  covered  by  its  accumulated  surplus.  CMC's  property  rate \ncollection  efficiency  has  ranged  from  94.7%  in  2003  to  84.1%  in  2006.  However,  in  terms  of \nnumber of months for accounts receivables, CMC's performance was poor over the 2001\u20132008 \nperiod, but it is improving (from 17.2 months in 2001 to 14 months in 2008). With no incremental \nrevenue from the Project, CMC will have to finance debt service and increased O&M costs from \nits own revenue. It will have to increase its revenue by SLRs370 million in real term by 2014 to \nadequately finance O&M cost and debt service.14   \n \n\nFinancial and Operational Performance of Colombo Municipal Council \n\ninputs  are  designed \n\n                                                 \n11  NWSDB also owns and operates a small scheme in Kataragama and various housing schemes in Koggala.  \n12  For 2003\u20132007, government grants and reimbursements were the biggest source of revenue (about 81%). In 2007, \n\nCMC did not receive any grants for sewerage operations, resulting in a marginal revenue of SLRs8million. \n\n13  Asset  management  considers  the  process  of  establishing  on  operating  regime  under  which  the  sustainability  of \ncapital investment for assets is ensured through effective management of risk, performance, condition and cost. \n14 For example, by revising annual rental values (13% increase) and increasing the property tax rate (5 percentage \n\npoints increase for both residential and commercial areas). \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3.1: Colombo Municipal Council Financial Performance, 2004\u20132007 (SLRs million) \nItem \n\n2007 \n\n2006 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\nCapital Receipt and Expenditure \n\nRevenue and Recurrent Expenditure \n\nCapital Receipt \nCapital Expenditure \nSurplus (Deficit) \n\nRevenue \nRecurrent Expenditure \nSurplus (Deficit) \nSewerage Operations \n\nRevenue \nRecurrent Expenditure \nSurplus (Deficit) \n\n366 \n431 \n  (65) \n\n2,554 \n2,500 \n54 \n\n  54 \n183 \n(129) \n\n605 \n535 \n  71 \n\n2,984 \n2,964 \n20 \n\n  98 \n242 \n(144) \n\n     1,085 \n 448 \n 637 \n\n3,365 \n3,641 \n(277) \n\n  26 \n282 \n(256) \n\n251 \n496 \n(245) \n\n3,701 \n4,069 \n(369) \n\n    8 \n303 \n(295) \n\nSource: Colombo Municipal Council. \n \nHistorically,  the  incentives  for  improving  services  have  been  political,  arising  from  the \n17. \ninvolvement  of  the  elected  council  members,  or  have  been  instigated  by  the  CMC  officers \nthrough their desire to serve the public.

Table A3.2 contains a summary of the income statement for 2005\u2013\n2008. Because of the recently approved water tariff increase, NWSDB has projected a profit for \n2009 of about $4 million.

While this is an appropriate interim measure, it \nmay need to be integrated into NWSDB's decentralization process once activities are expanded. \nAvailable  preliminary  annualized  revenue  and  expenses  data  for  sewerage  activities 16 show \noverall  losses,  with  operating  expenses  exceeding  income  by  about  a  third.  Nonetheless,  this \nrepresents a substantial improvement in performance from previous years when there was no \nsewerage tariff. NWSDB is preparing a revision of its sewerage tariff in 2010.  \n \n21. \nSalary  and  personnel  costs  are  65%  of  all  sewerage-related  costs,  while  utility  costs \n(essentially electricity costs) are 12%. Repairs and maintenance costs remained low (5% of the \ntotal) during 2008. Although some schemes (such as that in Hikaduwa) are relatively new, and \nno major repairs are expected, the maintenance allocation will need to increase progressively.  \n \nH. \n\nPolicy Gaps and Weaknesses  \n\n22. \nPrivate sector participation in water and sanitation remains generally low, partly because \nof  the  inherent  difficulty  of  delinking  initiatives  and  reforms  from  the  political  process,  which \nwould  allow  tariff  setting  to  be  regulated  by  a  fully  functional  public  utility  commission  entirely \nreflecting  capital  and  operational  costs,  including  an  adequate  return  on  invested  capital,  and \nthe  pending  status  of  the  water  and  sanitation  policies  to  clearly  outline  the  role  and \nresponsibilities of the private sector and other partners.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16  This corresponds to the 8-month period from January 2008 to August 2008.

This  is  partly  due  to  the \nambiguous  institutional  arrangements  for  asset  ownership,  which  has  deterred  an  adequate \nlevel of budgeting and management of the system. Operational inefficiency has created an extra \nfinancial  burden  by  causing  emergency  repair  works  and  earlier  than  necessary  asset \nreplacement.  \n \n2. \nIn  2007,  the  attorney  general  issued  a  legal  opinion  that  all  wastewater  assets  within \nColombo  municipality  administrative  area  were  owned  by  the  Colombo  municipality.  Colombo \nMunicipal Council (CMC) is now a legal owner of the wastewater systems and at the same time \nis  responsible  for  their  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  CMC,  as  a  municipal  council \nconstituted and administered by the Municipal Council Ordinance,1 does not charge a separate \ntariff for municipal services but runs municipal services using the budget allocated from the pool \nof revenue collected from the property tax. However, this budget has been inadequate to enable \nit to carry out proper O&M. \n \nNow  that  the  Project  provides  a  large  capital  investment  to  rehabilitate  the  critical \n3. \nelements of the sewerage system, it is essential to ensure the sustainability of this investment. \nIn  parallel  with  various  activities  to  support  institutional  and  operational  strengthening,  the \nProject proposes a consolidated contract combining design, construction, and O&M. Under this \ncontract,  the  budget  for  O&M  is  secured  through  the  contract,  and  the  staff  of  the  municipal \nservice  provider  will  receive  on-the-job  training  throughout  the  contract  period,  in  particular \nduring the commissioning period, before they take over the full responsibility for the O&M of the \nrehabilitated sewerage assets. \n \n4. \nUnder  this  contract,  CMC,  as  the  asset  owner,  retains  responsibilities  for  asset \nmanagement and capital investment works contemplated under the Project, through the project \nmanagement  unit  of  the  Project  (PMU).  The  contractor  will  design,  build  and  operate  and \nmaintain  the  pumping  stations  at  a  pre-agreed  cost.  The  key  merits  of  this  combined  contract \nare (i) to incentivize the contractor to take an integrated approach to system design, considering \nO&M aspects; (ii) to indirectly enhance the quality of construction by extending the contractor's \nresponsibility  beyond  the  commissioning  and  maintenance  stage;  (iii)  to  provide  continuity  of \nsystem  operation  while  the  construction  is  ongoing;  (iv)  to  increase  the  predictability  of  the \nsystem  in  terms  of  technical  and  budgetary  requirements;  (v)  to  involve  CMC  staff  for  a \ntransition period before they take full responsibility; and (vi) to secure an adequate O&M budget \nbased  on  contractual  requirements.  The  design\u2013build\u2013operate  contract  will  clearly  define  the \nterms and conditions for each stage. \n \n5. \n2.5 years, and O&M for 3 years\u2014with a possible extension for another 3 years. \n \n6. \nThe scope of the O&M element of the contract is limited to responsibility for the O&M of \nthe  pumping  station  facilities  constructed  and  equipment  provided  by  the  contractor,  with \npossible expansion to the remaining three pumping stations that have not been included in the \nscope  of  the  Project  but  were  recently  rehabilitated  by  other  external  development  agencies' \nfinancial support.  \n\nThe term of the contract will be 6 years\u2014detailed design for 0.5 years, construction for \n\n                                                 \n1 Municipal  Council  Ordinance  No.  17  of  1865,  later  amended  and  called  the  Colombo  Municipal  (Constitution) \n\nOrdinance No. 6 of 1935. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n7. \n \n\nThe contractor's key responsibilities in relation to the O&M will include: \n\n(i) \n\ntraining  and  direct  management  of  CMC  staff,  improving  their  technical  and \noperational skills through knowledge transfer on the newly constructed system; \n(ii)  applying a system of work planning and planned preventive maintenance for the \n\npumping facilities included in the contract;  \n\n(iii)  preparing  a  work  plan  and  maintaining  asset  history  details  within  an  asset \nmanagement  and  work  planning  business  system  that  will  be  procured  by  CMC \nunder the Project; \n\n(iv)  managing the stores within a stores management system that will be procured by \nCMC under the Project and maintaining adequate levels of spare parts, taking into \nconsideration their frequency of use and delivery periods; \n\n(v)  optimizing  the  pump  schedules  for  each  station  and  revising  them  in  light  of \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\noperational experience and seasonal variations; \nissuing to the operators, through the CMC management, a list of daily, weekly and \nmonthly tasks that they will be required to perform; \nimproving  the  occupational  safety  and  health  conditions  for  CMC  employees \nthrough the introduction of good practices; and \n\n(viii)  improving environmental compliance by ensuring that the facilities and equipment \nare operated proficiently to reduce discharges through the sea outfalls that do not \ncomply  with  environmental  regulations  and  to  reduce  the  occurrence  of  storm \nwater overflows. \n\n8. \nThe  contractor  will  be  required  to  provide  a  team  of  supervisory  and  ancillary  staff, \nincluding trainers. CMC will provide the operators, maintenance staff, work planners, engineers, \nand administrative and other staff. The contractor will specify in the bid the list of staff required, \nwith  various  disciplines  and  skills  categories.  CMC  staff  will  remain  CMC  employees  and  be \nsubject to their current CMC conditions of employment. The contractor will have the right to give \ninstructions to CMC staff on day-to-day operational and maintenance works. \n \n9. \nThe  contractor  will  be  paid  a  base  fee  to  cover  its  fixed  costs  for  the  O&M  of  the \nfacilities. Any power penalty payment will be deducted from the base fee and any power bonus \nwill be added to it, in accordance with a calculation method\u2014the comparison between the bid \npower  consumption  and  the  actual  power  consumption  measured  by  an  energy  audit\u2014to  be \nagreed in the contract.  \n\n \n\n\f \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES BY FINANCIER AND BY IMPLEMENTING AGENCY \n \nTable A6.1 : Detailed Cost Estimates By Financier \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\nADB \nOCR Financing \n\nADB \nADF Financing \n\nCosta \n\n$b \n\n \n\n% of Cost \nCategoryc \n \n\n \n\n% of Cost \nCategoryc \n \n\n \n\n Government \nFinancing \nTax and \nDuties \n\n% of Cost \nCategory \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n\nInvestment Costs \n\n1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  rehabilitating  sewerage  infrastructure  in  the  Colombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  area  and \nsurrounding  areas  and  will  improve  environmental  and  public  health  through  improved  urban  services.  This  is  line  with  the \nGovernment's  Ten-Year  Development  Framework,  2006\u20132016,  which  includes  increasing  access  to  improved  sanitation \nfacilities  as  part  of  its  focus  on  urban  development.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor.  The  public  health \nimpact from reduced overflows and leakages will benefit the poor who often live near polluted inland water ways.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nA survey conducted during project preparation gathered baseline socio-economic information and willingness to pay data. The \nsurvey sample was drawn from 20 locations across the Project area and involved 1,000 household interviews, supplemented \nby 100 interviews with public and private sector organizations. The poverty analysis used primary data from the survey and \nprimary  information  gathered  from  case  studies  in  three  on-site  areas,  transect  walks,  and  focus  group  discussions  with \nvarious stakeholders. Secondary data from government agencies and international organizations were also used. \n \nThe  survey  recorded  that  5%  of  respondents  had  household  incomes  below  the  poverty  line,  which  is  fairly  consistent  with \nofficial district data. The survey covered the Colombo Municipality, Thimbirigasyaya, Dehiwela/Mount Lavinia, and Kolonnawa \ndivisional secretariats. It identified that, for high-income households, 80% used the central sewerage system. By contrast, only \n58% of poor households were covered by the system. The poorest households not connected to the central sewerage system \nused latrines. The poverty analysis reflected that the undercapacity of the sewer mains did not allow users to connect to the \ncentral sewerage system. Leaks cause health risks and odor nuisance; and blockages caused by sedimentation due to poor \noperation and maintenance and the lack of rehabilitation undertaken over the past 20 years.   \n \nThe survey showed that for high-income households not covered by the central sewerage system, most have septic tanks and \nsoakaways. For the poorest households, none have septic tanks or soakaways, because they lack land and their habitations \nare close to each other. If low-income households own septic tanks, they are often poorly maintained, since the roads where \nthey live are too narrow for maintenance equipment. The problem is further compounded by high water tables which fill septic \ntanks almost immediately, and improper septic tank construction. About 66% of respondents dispose of grey-water in street \ndrains.  Local  government  cites  a  lack  of  manpower,  equipment  (such  as  gully  suckers),  improper  urban  planning,  and \ndilapidated  systems  as  the  main  barriers  to  satisfactory  sewerage  and  wastewater  treatment.  Poor  sanitary  conditions \ncontribute  to  diseases  such  as  filariasis,  skin  diseases,  diarrhea,  dengue,  and  malaria.  Respondents  attribute  increases  in \nmosquito-borne  diseases  to  maintenance  holes  that  spill  water  most  of  the  year\u2014requiring  them  to  burn  mosquito  coils \nthroughout the day. Improvements to sanitation will reduce diseases and consequent morbidity and mortality. \n \nThe provision of high-quality and sustainable services to support economic development and poverty reduction will rely on the \nProject\u2019s  support  to  build  the  capacity  of  CMC  to  plan  and  manage  urban  infrastructure  more  effectively.  The  Project  will \nimprove  CMC's  capacity  to  plan,  develop  and  operate  pro-poor  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  based  on  an  improved \nunderstanding  of  poverty  and  on  processes  of  participatory  planning  and  development.  Poverty  and  social  analysis  using  a \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative techniques is required to gauge post-Project benefits in terms of improved access \nto  basic  services  by  the  poor.  The  baseline  survey,  which  will  be  carried  out  at  the  start  of  the  Project,  will  serve  as  the \nbenchmark  against  which  post-Project  impacts  on  the  poor  may  be  measured.  Benefits  to  poor  households,  benefits  to \nwomen, increased participation and capacity building of poor including women are some of the issues that will be monitored \nduring and after implementation. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe  Project  will  include  a  component  to  institutionalize  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  practices  at  CMC,  in  line  with  the \ncommitments set out in its (draft) poverty reduction strategy. Overall, it is anticipated that the Project will reduce the burden of \ndiseases, treatment costs, and productivity losses. Women, especially poor women, will benefit from a reduction in the time \nand energy spent in disposing of sewage and the reduced work burden associated with cleaning and family health care. The \nspin-offs are expected to be economic growth and direct employment in unskilled/construction work under the Project. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nThe Project will include a pro-poor and gender subcomponent, under the institutional strengthening component of the loan, to \ninstitutionalize good practices in sanitation in underserved settlements in CMC, together with grant-financed pilot initiatives for \ncommunity-based and gender-responsive on-site sanitation facilities in selected underserved settlements in the CMC area.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis \n \nHuman  development  indicators  show  marked  improvement  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  per  capita  income,  life  expectancy,  adult  literacy, \nand education in the last four decades. In 2003, life expectancy at birth was 74, the adult literacy rate was 90.3%, and the per \ncapita gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was $3,778 (UNDP, 2006, Human Development Report).  Based on \nthe  2002  census,  poverty  incidence  was  23%.  Poverty  incidence  among  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  districts  ranges  from  6%  to  34%.  It  is \nlowest  in  Colombo  (6%)  but  over  143,000  people  in  Colombo  have  per  capita  incomes  less  than  SLRs1,537.  Population \ngrowth is faster in Colombo than the other districts (1.35% in comparison with the national average of 1.14%). Further, there \nis a high degree of variation in poverty incidence within Colombo\u2019s divisions. It ranges from 2.7% in Sri Jayewardenepura to \n14.2%  in  Hanwella.  While  only  6%  had  incomes  below  the  poverty  line  in  Colombo,  26%  are  in  the  next  income  group,  so \nthere  are  many  vulnerable  people  who  are  at  risk  of  experiencing  poverty.  Poverty  in  urban  Colombo  is  characterized  by \nlimited access to basic services, including sanitation. \n \nIn general, data on  access to basic services are improving. For example, UNDP records that the population  with access to \nimproved sanitation increased from 68% in 1990 to 79% in 2002. However, sustaining these improvements will require proper \noperation  and  maintenance  of  existing  systems.  The  Colombo  sewerage  system  serves  only  20%  of  population  in  Greater \nColombo. The system, built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and extended in the 1980s has sections which \nrequire  urgent  repair.  For  the  remaining  80%,  the  majority  (65%)  are  served  by  on-site  facilities;  the  rest  (15%)  have  no \naccess  to  any  facilities.  Most  of  the  urban  poor  have  no  access  to  the  sewage  network  or  on-site  facilities  dispose  of  their \nwaste on the seashore, in canals and waterways, and in available open ground. With limited infrastructure and services, old \nand new urban centers risk not being capable of adequately supporting the increasing economic productivity of households. \n \nIn areas served by the sewerage system, the poor are  often not connected. The system has not kept  pace  with population \ngrowth and has deteriorated in many instances. The increase in the number of poor households is making their access as a \ngroup  worse  off.  Further,  in  areas  served  by  a  malfunctioning  sewerage  system,  the  poor  who  are  not  connected  are \nsubjected  to  pollution  caused  by  overflows  and  leaks  from  the  system  into  waterways,  which  are  already  polluted  by  direct \ndischarge from households without access to the system. In areas with no services, the poor do not have household systems \nbecause they lack of funds for the capital investments required and do not have enough space for an individual septic tank. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nA  diversity  analysis  has  been  undertaken  before  the  stakeholder  analysis  covering  physical,  socioeconomic,  and  usage \ndiversity.  Stakeholder  mapping  identified  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries,  pressure  groups,  and  other  interest  groups  at the \nnational, divisional, project, and community levels. The stakeholders were grouped into seven categories comprising: (i) users \nof  the  main  sewerage  system,  (ii)  users  of  septic  tanks  in  areas  not  served  by  the  sewerage  system,  (iii)  managers  of \nsewerage  systems,  (iv)  other  service  providers,  (v)  regulators  and  administrators,  (vi)  policy  makers,  and  (vii)  other  interest \ngroups.  The  expectations  and  likely  benefits,  and  issues  and  concerns,  of  these  stakeholders  were  analyzed  in  the \nstakeholder  analysis  and  considered  in  the  project  design,  particularly  in  developing  participation  strategies.  Information \ndissemination and consultations have been undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in project design.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  Project  will  ensure  participation  during  preplanning,  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Pre-\nplanning  focuses  on  building  awareness  of  the  Project,  including  disseminating  information  and  awareness  campaigns.  A \nseparate framework for public awareness will be developed. The awareness campaigns will primarily ensure that the public in \nthe project area understands and appreciates (i) the link between good sanitation, hygiene, and health; (ii) the hidden costs of \nnot having good sanitation in terms of incurred medical costs, lost time, and burden on public medical services, and (iii) the \ntrue costs of the operation and maintenance of a wastewater collection, and disposal system and, therefore, the need for a \nrealistic  wastewater  service  charge.  During  planning,  participatory  activities  to  be  undertaken  by  the  project  include \ncommunity  and  resource  mapping,  identification  of  affected  people,  gathering  baseline  information,  consultations  and \ndiscussions.  At  the  planning  stage  assistance  and  mitigation  plans  will  be  finalized  through  consultations  and  disclosed  to \nstakeholders.  During  implementation,  participation  will  be  ensured  in  carrying  out  implementation  and  monitoring  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10  47 \n\nevaluation. Women's representation and their effective involvement in all consultative and participatory processes supported \nunder the Project will be ensured. \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n \nNational gender indicators show a balance between men and women in Sri Lanka. The 2001 census survey (covering limited \nareas in the north and east) indicated a sex ratio of 97.9 men to 100 women. Women had a higher life expectancy at birth and \nliteracy rates just 3% less than those of men. Despite  women's higher levels of participation in education at secondary and \ntertiary levels, their political participation and representation is minimal. Life expectancy at 72 years for men and 77 years for \nwomen masks the high morbidity rate for women caused by illnesses such as diarrhea, dysentery and malaria. Safe drinking \nwater  was  available  to  75.4%  of  the  overall  population  and  satisfactory  sanitation  to  79%  in  2002,  but  solid  waste \nmanagement  in  urban  areas  remains  a  critical  issue.  In  terms  of  water  and  sanitation,  the  burden  of  improper  design, \nconstruction, and operation of water and sanitation is borne largely by women. When piped water systems do not function, it \nis women who have to ensure its availability for use of other household members. If toilets are not useable, it is women who \nnegotiate  with  neighbors  to  share  toilets.  They  are  also  responsible  for  disposing  of  wastewater  from  the  kitchen  and  for \nensuring  that  potential  problems  with  neighbors  are  minimized.  Nonfunctioning  public  toilets  are  seen  as  a  bigger  issue  for \nwomen than for men. Infants and children are particularly prone to waterborne diseases caused by insufficient sanitation, and \ncare of the sick is the responsibility of women. The Project will respond to these issues by ensuring women's representation \nand  their  participation  in  all  consultation  and  participation  processes  and  their  equal  access  to  employment  opportunities \nprovided  under  the  loan.  More  specifically,  CMC's  commitment  to  assess  and  institutionalize  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive \napproaches  for  on-site  solid  waste  management  (see  below)  may  open  up  greater  opportunities  for  beneficial  impacts  on \nwomen. \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nThe pro-poor and gender subcomponent under the institutional strengthening component of the loan will support: \n(i) \n\nTaking stock of lessons learnt at CMC. This  will aim to take stock of lessons learnt from pilot projects  within CMC \nfunded between 1998 and 2009 by development partners: Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom  (DFID),  UN-Habitat,  German  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  and  the  International  Development  Research \nCenter  (IDRC),  The  pilot  projects  targeted  the  provision  of  basic  services  to  underserved  settlements  (USS)  in \nColombo.  The  stocktaking  will  identify  pilot  schemes  carried  out  in  underserved  areas  in  partnership  with  CMC.  It \nwill:  (a)  assess  the  design,  implementation  arrangements,  consultative  processes  and  socioeconomic  and  gender-\nrelated results; (b) document and draw lessons from the schemes; and (c) review the existing legal, regulatory and \nadministrative frameworks for the provision of urban basic services in the CMC area. \nReviewing promising practices in South and Southeast Asia. The findings and recommendations of the stocktaking \nexercise  will  presented,  discussed  and  further  assessed  at  an  international  workshop  n  Colombo.  This  will: \n(a)  promote  lateral  learning  between  CMC  and  other  selected  municipal  councils  in  South  and  Southeast  Asia; \n(b)  share  information  on  socially-inclusive  and  gender-related  policies,  strategies,  and  operational  approaches \n(including the effective use of pro-poor funding allocations) for greater outreach to the urban poor; and (c) inform the \ndevelopment  of  the  Greater  Colombo  Wastewater  Master  Plan  through  the  incorporation  of  pro-poor  and  gender-\ninclusive perspectives. \nIdentifying  the  way  forward.  This  will  include:  (a)  finalizing  the  CMC's  poverty  reduction  strategy,  drawing  on \ndocumented  lessons  learnt;  (b)  assisting  CMC  to  update  policy  guidelines  to  institutionalize  good  practices;  (c) \nassessing future investment requirements in accordance with the Strategy; and (d) identifying technical requirements \nto continue recording the USS data into the current geographic information system (GIS) database. \nPiloting  alternative  and  unconventional  on-site  sanitation  in  underserved  areas.  These  activities,  financed  by  the \nPoverty and Environment Fund,  will consist of carrying out one  pilot intervention (18 months) in two selected USS \nwhich  are  not  served  by  the  existing  public  sewerage  system.  This  will  involve:  (a)  carrying  out  a  participatory \nconsultative  process  with  the  beneficiaries  to  identify  the  most  appropriate  alternative  sanitation  technology;\n(b) identifying the potential for community participation in the implementation, operation and maintenance of the most \nappropriate  alternative  technique;  and  (c)  assessing  the  possibility  of  extending  the  piloted  approach  to  other \nmunicipal areas. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/\nNo Impact \n\nLimited Impact \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nStrategy to Address \nIssue \nThe Project minimizes land \nacquisition and \nresettlement impacts. \nRehabilitation of the \nsewerage system will not \nrequire permanent land \nacquisition nor will it have \npermanent resettlement \nimpacts.

By  design,  the  Project  will  not  require  land  acquisition.  For \nrehabilitating  gravity  sewers,  sections  totaling  2.61  kilometers  (km)  will  use  trenchless \ntechnology  and  will  have  no  resettlement  impacts.  The  remaining  sections  (8.99  km)  will  use \neither trenchless technology or an open-cut approach. The choice of technology will depend on \na conditions survey that will be undertaken as part of the Project. Trenchless technology will not \nhave  resettlement  impacts,  so,  as  a  conservative  approach,  the  short  resettlement  plan  in \nSupplementary Appendix I assumes that the remaining sections will use an open-cut approach. \nOpen-cut rehabilitation will not require land acquisition. Where there is sufficient road width (i.e., \nfour or more lanes, estimated at 2.83 km), traffic can be managed to ensure that works will not \nresult in temporary access loss. For two-lane roads, there may be potential temporary impacts \nrelated to access disruptions. Transect walks were conducted on two road sections totaling 1.25 \nkm.1  \n \n2. \nThe  potential  temporary  impacts  of  an  open-cut  approach  would  be  access  disruption \nfor: (i) residents, (ii) businesses and clients, (iii) vehicles, and (iv) institutions and patrons. This \ncan  be  mitigated  through  good  construction  practices,  which  will  be  the  responsibility  of \nconstruction  contractors.2  Where  access  cannot  be  assured,  businesses  and  their  employees \nmay lose income. The transect walks were used as a basis to conservatively estimate possible \nincome  losses.3  There  will  be  no  permanent  or  temporary  land  acquisition.  Based  on  transect \nwalks and confirmation from the project preparation civil engineers, there will be no impacts on \npermanent structures or other assets. While it is estimated that there would be potential impacts \nfor an estimated 156 residential households in terms of access inconvenience, interviews show \nthat residents' livelihoods will not be affected except when their businesses or employment are \naffected by access. Five institutions were recorded in the transect walks, including cooperatives, \na post office, dispensary, and a temple. The transect walk shows that the institutions' operations \nneed  not  be  affected,  but  additional  mitigation  measures  such  as  not  conducting  work  during \nspecial  days  for  a  temple  should  be  undertaken  during  construction.  Residents  and  business \nmay  temporarily  lose  secure  parking  for  their  vehicles.  Businesses  and  their  employees  may \nexperience partial income loss because of reduced client access. One pipe section is 20 m long, \nrequiring  a  trench  1.5  m  wide.  By  opening  the  trench  one  section  at  a  time,  the  disruption  is \nestimated to be 5 days per 20 meter (m) section. There is great potential to minimize impacts, \nthrough proper planning and implementation of mitigation measures, to a level that will not affect \nincome. This will be undertaken during detailed design and project implementation. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  During  the  transect  walks,  interview  schedules  for  residents,  businesses,  employees,  and  institutions  were \nimplemented and this was supplemented with focus group discussions  to estimate potential temporary impacts. \n2   Measures  are  identified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  include:  (i)  leaving  spaces  for  access \nbetween mounds of soil, (ii) providing  walkways and metal sheets to maintain access across trenches for people \nand  vehicles  where  required,  (iii)  increasing  the  workforce  in  front  of  critical  areas  such  as  institutions,  \n(iv) consulting  business and  institutions  about operating hours and factoring this in  work schedules, (v) providing \nadvance  information  on  works  to  be  undertaken,  including  appropriate  signs,  and  (vi)  coordination  with  the \nColombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  Traffic  and  Roads  Safety  Division  for  rerouting  of  traffic  and  traffic \nmanagement, and ensuring appropriate signs and policing of traffic. \n\n3   The  assumptions  are:  (i)  on  two-lane  sections,  there  would  be  a  need  for  temporary  road  closure,  and  (ii)  entire \n\nroads (as opposed to sections which are being worked on) will be closed. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n50 \n \n\nTable A11.1: Summary of Potential Resettlement Impacts \n\nCategories of Impacts \n \nLand Acquisition (permanent or temporary) \nAffected Structures \nParking Disruption (total number of residential vehicle owners) \nParking Disruption (total number of commercial operators)  \nAffected Mobile Hawkers  \nAffected Immovable Businesses \nAffected Employees of Businesses  \nAffected Institutions \n\nTemporary Impacts \n\n \n\n0 \n0 \n515 \n480 \n65 \n428 \n1,340 \n22 \n\n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n3. \nDuring the transect walks surveys were undertaken, covering 61 residents, 15 hawkers, \n99  business  owners  or  operators,  306  employees,  5  heads  of  institutions,  111  three-wheel \ndrivers, and 4 nightwatchers. These were supplemented by focus group discussions to provide \na  comprehensive  view  of  the  socioeconomic  characteristics  of  persons  in  the  project  area. \nApproximately  20%  of  households  were  headed  by  women.  However,  none  of  households \nheaded  by  women  had  incomes  below  the  poverty  line.  Average  per  capita  income  was \nSLRs20,400  per  month  for  those  surveyed  in  New  Kettarama,  and  SLRs16,094  in  Bodhiraja \nMawatha.  Of  those  who  will  have  potential  income  loss  during  project  construction, \nnightwatchers of parking lots were identified as vulnerable. The average incomes of this group \nwere only SLRs7,700 per month. To mitigate impacts on this vulnerable group, the Project will \nensure employment for these people. \n \nB. \n \nThe Land Acquisition Act, 1950 (LAA, amended from time to time) governs acquisition of \n4. \nland for public purposes in Sri Lanka. The act provides compensation for land, structures, and \ncrops. To address involuntary resettlement impacts due to development projects not covered by \nthe  act,  the  Government  adopted  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  2001  (NIRP). \nThe NIRP identifies as one of its policy principles drafting amendments to the act to bring it into \nline  with  the  NIRP  for  government  approval  and  to  prepare  the  necessary  implementation \nguidelines. Nine core involuntary resettlement principles for the Project were taken directly from \nthe NIRP.4 An additional two principles from ADB\u2019s principles not clearly covered by NIRP were \nadded:  (i)  affected  people  are  to  be  identified  and  recorded  as  soon  as  possible  in  order  to \nestablish their eligibility through a population record or census that serves as an eligibility cutoff \ndate, preferably at the project identification stage, to prevent a subsequent influx of encroachers \nor others who wish to take advantage of such benefits; and (ii) the full resettlement costs are to \nbe  included  in  the  presentation  of  project  costs  and  benefits.  The  entitlement  matrix  for  the \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\n                                                 \n4   (i)  Involuntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  reduced  as  much  as  possible  by  reviewing  alternatives  to  the \nproject as well as alternatives within the project; (ii) where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, affected people \nshould be assisted to re-establish themselves and improve their quality of life; (iii) compensation for loss of land, \nstructures,  other  assets  and  income  should  be  based  on  full  replacement  cost  and  should  be  paid  promptly  (this  \nshould include transaction costs and replacement land should be an option for compensation in the case of loss of \nland\u2014in  the  absence  of  replacement  land  cash  compensation  should  be  an  option  for  all  affected  people);  (iv) \nresettlement  should  be  planned  as  a  development  activity  for  the  affected  people;  (v)  affected  people  should  be \nfully involved in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation and development options at the earliest \nopportunity  (resettlement  should  be  planned  and  implemented  with  full  participation  of  the  provincial  and  local \nauthorities);  (vi)  common  property  resources  and  community  and  public  services  should  be  provided  to  affected \npeople (to assist those affected to be economically and socially integrated into the host communities, participatory \nmeasures should  be  designed and implemented); (vii)  affected people  who do not have documented  title to land \nshould receive fair and just treatment; (viii) vulnerable groups should be identified and given appropriate assistance \nto  substantially  improve  their  living  standards,  gender  equality  and  equity  should  be  ensured  and  adhered  to \nthroughout  the  policy;  and  (ix)  project  executing  agencies  should  bear  the  full  costs  of  compensation  and \nresettlement. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nProject, based on the above principles and the potential impacts, is in Table A10.2.

During \nconsultations, information was disseminated to affected people. Local language versions of the \nsummary resettlement plan have been made available in relevant government agencies and the \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  office.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  and  the  MLGPC  website.  Finalized  resettlement  plans  will  also  be  disclosed  on  the \nADB\u2019s  and  the  MLGPC  websites  and  posted  in  local  government  offices;  and  information \ndissemination and consultation will continue throughout project implementation.  \n \n6. \nGrievances  of  affected  people  will  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  PMU \nresettlement specialist. Grievances not redressed by the specialist will be brought to the project \ndirector. Grievances not redressed will be brought to the safeguards committee in each district. \nThere is a long history of grievance redress for CMC services through the district engineer. This \npractice  will  be  formalized  for  resettlement  purposes  through  the  safeguards  committee.  The \nsafeguards  committee  will  comprise  the  district  engineer  as  chair,  a  representative  from \nMLGPC,  the  PMU  social  safeguards  officer,  a  female  affected  person  or  resident  from  the \ndistrict, and the PMU resettlement specialist who will observe and take minutes. The safeguards \ncommittee  will  meet  when  grievances  are  put  forward  by  the  project  director  to  determine  the \nmerit  of  each  grievance,  and  to  resolve  grievances  within  a  month  of  receiving  the  complaint. \nFurther  grievances  will  be  referred  by  affected  people  to  the  project  steering  committee.  The \ngrievance redress mechanisms will continue to function throughout the project duration. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nBased  on  the  preliminary  design  there  are  no  permanent  impacts.  Temporary  impacts \nare  restricted  to  impacts  on  access.  Affected  people  will  be  provided  with  advance  notice  of  \nconstruction  activities  including  duration  and  type  of  disruption.  Construction  contractors  will \nensure  income  and  access  losses  are  avoided  through  actions  identified  in  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination.  The  PMU  will  provide  secure  alternative  parking  locations,  and \nassistance to mobile hawkers to move temporarily so they can continue their economic activity. \nShould  construction  activities  result  in  unavoidable  livelihood  disruption,  compensation  for  lost \nincome or a transitional allowance for the period of disruption will be provided. Any temporarily \naffected community infrastructure and property will be restored to pre-project conditions as part \nof the contractor\u2019s contract. The PMU will assess whether there are vulnerable affected people. \nVulnerable households will be provided information on all potential construction employment as \na  result  of  the  Project.  Transect  walks  identified  nightwatchers  as  vulnerable  persons. \nNightwatchers will be ensured temporary project employment in the Project's provision of secure \nparking spaces. All compensation and assistance to affected people will be completed prior to \naward of civil works contracts. \n \n8. \nA  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  undertaken  to  identify  eligible  affected  people \nafter detailed design has been completed. At the time of the survey, individuals who are living \nor  working  in  areas  that  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  construction  or  operation  of  the \ninfrastructure works, regardless of whether they have legal title to the affected land or assets, \nwill be provided with cards to identify them as eligible for compensation and assistance.5  \n \n\nCompensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n\n                                                 \n5   Eligible  affected  people  will  fall  under  the  following  general  categories:  (i)  persons  who  lose  income  while \nconstruction  is  carried  out  in  the  vicinity  of  their  business  (owner/operators  of  businesses  and  their  employees \nincluding  nightwatchers  in  parking  areas,  and  hawkers)  (ii)  persons  whose  normal  activities  are  disturbed  by  the \npresence  of  trenches,  excavated  soil  and  machinery  (residents  and  those  under  category  i);  (iii)  affected  people \nwho belong to socially and economically vulnerable groups. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n9. \nThe  estimated  budget  required  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  is  SLRs26  million. \nThe  resettlement  budget  will  include  a  contingency  amount  of  10%  to  cover  unanticipated \nresettlement impacts and additional amounts that may be needed to resolve disputes. A budget \nline  will  be  allocated  for  the  contingency,  but  funds  will  only  be  released  on  approval  of  the \nPMU project director accompanied by a proper justification for the additional expenditure. Any \nother departures from the budgets and allocations indicated in the resettlement plan will require \nthe same process of application and approval. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nThe Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils will be the Project\u2019s executing \nagency.  CMC  will  be  the  implementing  agency  responsible  for  implementing  most  of  the \nactivities,  except  for  the  pumping  station  rehabilitation  works  within  the  NWSDB  service  area, \nfor which NWSDB will be the implementing agency. A project management unit (PMU)  will be \nestablished  within  CMC  directly  under  the  municipal  commissioner,  led  by  a  CMC  officer  at \nsenior management level for the duration of the Project. A small project implementation unit will \nbe  established  for  implementing  the  works  within  NWSDB  service  area.  A  national  project \nsteering committee will provide policy guidance to the Project.  \n \n11. \nCMC  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  capacity  will  be  strengthened  through \nprovision  of  expertise, and  training  and  support  for  CMC  staff,  particularly  at  the  district  level. \nWithin  the  PMU,  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit  will  deal  with  safeguards  functions. \nResettlement  issues  across  the  Project  will  be  managed  and  coordinated  by  a  social \nsafeguards  officer  of  the  PMU.  The  social  safeguards  officer  will  be  supported  by  a  domestic \nresettlement  specialist  who  will  be  part  of  the  design,  construction  supervision,  and \nmanagement consultants.  \n \nF. \n \n12. \nCompensation  for  lost  income  and  PMU  costs  associated  with  resettlement  will  be \nfunded  by  the  Government.  Survey  costs  and  other  implementation  costs  not  covered  by  the \nPMU  will  be  funded  by  the  Project.  Any  land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation  and \nrehabilitation  of  income  and  livelihood  will  be  considered  as  an  integral  component  of  Project \ncosts.  \n\nResettlement Financing \n\nG. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n\n \n\n13. \nThe PMU social safeguards officer will monitor whether resettlement is effective, make \nrecommendations for change where necessary, and report to the project director. The design, \nconstruction supervision, and management consultants -resettlement specialist will provide the \nPMU  with  training  in  resettlement  issues,  social  survey  methods  and  data  analysis  and \nrecording.  Monitoring  data  will  be  collected  from  PMU,  DSC,  contractors,  and  individual \naffected  people,  and  will  be  compared  with  entitlements  and  disbursement  schedules \nestablished  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  PMU  will  also  engage  a  consultant  as  an \nindependent external monitor to conduct monitoring of the resettlement process. The consultant \nwill conduct compliance monitoring to check that entitlements have been provided as specified \nin the resettlement plan, and social impact evaluations to determine whether the compensation \nmeasures  have  mitigated  the  effects  of  the  project  and  delivered  the  intended  social \nimprovements.  The  external  monitor  will  report  to  MLGPC  and  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation,  and  will  produce  annual  reports  that  will  identify  any  outstanding  issues  that \nneed  to  be  addressed,  and  any  departures  from  Government  or  ADB  policy,  together  with \nrecommended remedial action. The reports will also identify any strategic lessons that need to \nbe  learned,  so  that  these  can  be  incorporated  into  future  resettlement  activities  of  the \nimplementing agencies, executing agency, the Government, or ADB.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n54 \n \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION (SHORT) \n\n \n1. \nThe  Greater  Colombo  Wastewater  Management  Project  will  improve  the  urban \nenvironment  by  securing  improved  sanitation  services  for  Colombo  by  upgrading  sewerage \ninfrastructure, and strengthening the institutional, operational, and project management capacity \nof the wastewater service provider. The objectives of the Project are in line with those under the \nADB  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  2009-2011  and  the  Government's  Ten-Year  Development \nPlan.1 \n \nADB classifies the Project as environmental assessment category B2 according to ADB\u2019s \n2. \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  Colombo \nMunicipal Council (CMC) will submit project information to the Central Environmental Authority \n(CEA)  and  the  Coastal  Conservation  Department  (CCD)  to  obtain  necessary  environmental \nclearances required by Government legislation. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Greater  Colombo  Sewerage  System  includes  sewer  infrastructure  for  the  north \ncatchment  area  and  the  south  catchment  area.  All  the  wastewater  is  discharged  to  the  Indian \nOcean  through  two  long  sea  outfalls  at  Mutwal  (north  catchment)  and  Wellawatte  (south \ncatchment). Built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and extended in the 1980s, \nsome parts of Greater Colombo\u2019s sewerage system are in need of urgent repair. Due to its poor \ncondition and long neglected operation and maintenance (O&M), the system is not performing \nwell. \n \n4. \nfor implementation under the Project. \n \n\nTable A12.1 lists the rehabilitation and upgrade of the sewage infrastructure considered \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nTable A12.1: Details of Proposed Rehabilitation and Sewerage System Upgrade \n\n1. Rehabilitation of Main Sewerage System (Pumping Stations, Pumping Mains, Fine Screens) \n(i) Civil, mechanical and electrical works associated with installation or refurbishment of 17 pumping stations and four \nnew  pumping  mains;  (ii)  installation  of  coarse  screens  and  grit  removal  equipment  at  10  existing  and  one  new \npumping  stations;  (iii)  installation  of  fine  screens,  grit  removal  and  washing  equipment  at  headworks  of  the  two \noutfalls;  and  (iv)  supply  of  10  standby  generators  including  bundled  fuel  storage  tanks  and  electrical  control \nequipment \n2. Rehabilitation of Gravity Sewers \n(i) Replacement of 10 km critical sewers that are operating at below capacity, and (ii) refurbishment of existing gravity \nsewers by replacement of non-operational control (sluice) valves \n3. Rehabilitation of Sea Outfalls \n(i) Refurbishment of two sea outfalls in Mutwal and Wellawatte; (ii) installation of new diffuser at Mutwal outfall; (iii) \nunblocking of outlet points at Wellawatte outfall; and (iv) removal and safe disposal of grit deposits within the outfalls \nand improvement of means of access into outfalls \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n \nB. \n \nThe significant positive environmental impacts are: (i) improvement in surface water and \n5. \ngroundwater  quality  due  to  reduction  in  overflows;  (ii)  elimination  of  future  road  collapses;  \n(iii)  reduction  in  local  flooding;  (iv)  elimination  of  cross-contamination  in  water  supply; 3  \n                                                 \n1   The  Mahinda  Chintana  (Vision  for  a  New  Sri  Lanka:  2006-2016)  is  the  Government\u2019s  10-Year  Development \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n2  This category includes projects judged likely to have some adverse environmental impacts, but of less significance \n\n3  There are many cross-connections installed to provide local relief in times of heavy rainfall or power cuts, to avoid \nsewage flooding to properties and highways. These cause overloading of the sewers during heavy rain, increased \n\nFramework. \n\nthan Category A projects. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  55 \n\n(v) reduction in health risks related to sanitation, contaminated water, and wastes; (vi) increase \nin effluent dispersion for the two outfalls; (vii) improvement in aesthetics, and (viii) protection of \nmarine ecology. The Project will be complemented by a comprehensive capacity development \nprogram ranging from strategic planning and management to technical and operational training \nby (i) preparing standard operational practices, health and safety manual, emergency plan and \npreventive  maintenance  plan;  (ii)  training  operating  staff  on  preventive  maintenance  practices; \n(iii)  supporting  CMC  in  building  a  mechanism  to  monitor  and  comply  with  environmental \nregulatory  standards;  and  (iv)  providing  equipment  for  cleaning  the  sewers,  removing \nblockages, and hygienically transporting collected wastes (grit and screening). \n \n6. \nMost of the potential negative environmental impacts are during the construction phase, \nassociated  with  the  activities  of  the  construction  contractor(s).  By  including  environmental \nmanagement  clauses  in  the  individual  contract  documents,  the  potential  for  adverse  impacts \ncan be significantly reduced. The Project is not expected to have major environmental impacts \nduring  construction  because  (i)  proposed  works  will  be  within  flat,  urban,  and  existing  fenced \nland owned by CMC or National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), within the right-\nof-way  of  existing  roads,  and/or  underground,  (ii)  inevitable  disturbance  to  relatively  sensitive \nreceptors such as schools, housing, or places of worship will be mitigated through controls on \nthe  activities  of  the  contractors;    (iii)  use  of  generated  spoils4 will  be  limited  to  predetermined \nand  non-productive  areas;  (iv)  existing  sewers  will  be  relined,  or  replaced  using,  wherever \npossible, trenchless technologies; (v)  other utilities (specifically water pipes above sewer lines) \nwill  be  predetermined  to  prevent  interference;  (vi)  potential  access  disruption  for  residents, \nbusinesses  and  clients,  and  vehicles  will  be  mitigated  through  consultation,  and  provision  of \nadvanced information, walkways, and metal sheets; (vii)   assembly on land of inert materials for \nthe outfalls will not disturb the sea bed and the limited marine environment; and (viii) temporary \nrisks to workers, specifically in underwater work and confined spaces, will be mitigated by using \nthe services of experienced and certified marine contractors and specific contract provisions on \noccupational health and safety practices. \n \n7. \nDuring operations, potential environmental impacts will be public health effects, aesthetic \neffects,5 and effects on the marine ecology due to outfall discharges. The two long outfalls were \ninitially  designed  with  diffusers  to  achieve  high  levels  of  dilution  and  dispersion  which  will  be \nachieved  after  rehabilitation.  Modeling  studies6 indicate  good  mixing,  dispersion,  and  bacteria \ndie-off  under  most  weather  and  tide  conditions  during  operations  of  the  rehabilitated  outfalls. \nHowever,  pollution  sources  not  within  the  scope  of  the  Project  (Kelani  River,  existing  harbor, \nBeira Lake, the canals, and industries, institutions, and establishments that produce low levels \nof  pollution)  will  still  deposit  high-concentration  loadings  in  the  coastal  environment.  Regular \nmonitoring will be carried out on both outfalls, surface waters, and along coastlines. Repetitive \nmeasurements in the surface and vertical profile of sampling points situated in and around the \noutfall's end will be done for the correct evaluation of the discharge and for the evaluation of the \noutfall performance and effects. \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \npumping costs, introduction of grit and other debris, and overflows. The Project will implement a program to identify \nand remove such cross-connections. \n\n4   Approximately 6,400 m3 of spoils will be generated from ground excavation. \n5   Aesthetic  concerns  relates  to  the  possible  presence  of  sewage-associated  materials  such  as  floatable  solids, \ngrease, and oil which result in visual or olfactory pollution and to discoloration of the marine waters when dilution is \ninsufficient. \n\n6  Three studies have been carried out to investigate effluent plume dispersion from the sea outfalls, first under the \nGreater Colombo Sewerage Project in 2000, second under the Colombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project in \n2003\u20132004, and the most recent by the Lanka Hydraulic Institute in 2009. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\nC.  \n \n8. \nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Government  Provincial  Councils  (MLGPC)  will  be  the  executing \nagency.    A  national-level  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  oversee  the \nProject and provide policy guidance and coordination among the government agencies involved \nin the administrative process of the Project. CMC will be the implementing agency responsible \nfor supervising infrastructure construction (except for pumping stations within the NWSDB area \nfor which NWSDB will be the implementing agency), conducting the noninfrastructure elements, \nand  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  will  have  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) unit and will be supported by design and management consultants, who will \ndesign  the  infrastructure,  manage  tendering  of  contractors,  and  supervise  construction.  Their \ncontract  will  require  the  consultants  to  include  mitigation  measures  in  designs  where \nappropriate, and to specify other measures in construction contracts. Environmental issues will \nbe  coordinated  by  an  environmental  specialist  within  the  M&E  unit,  who  will  ensure  that  the \nProject complies with environmental safeguards. \n \nTable  A12.2  lists  the  potential  adverse  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  proposed  to \n9. \nreduce  these  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  It  identifies  who  will  be  responsible  for  the \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting.  The  table  shows  that  most  mitigation  activities  are  the \nresponsibility  of  the  construction  contractors  (employed  to  build  the  infrastructure  during  the \nconstruction  stage,  or  the  O&M  contractors  employed  to  conduct  maintenance  or  repair  work \nwhen the system is operating. Responsibility for the relevant measures will be assigned to the \ncontractors via the contracts through which they are appointed so they will be legally required to \ntake the necessary action. \n \nTable A12.2: Summary of Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Institutional Responsibilities \n\nPotential Adverse \nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nPre-Construction Stage (Location and Design)\nLand requirements \nInterference with existing utilities \nImpacts on heritage features \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \n\nConsultation on detailed alignment of sewers prior to installation \nDetailed consultation on existing utilities prior to installation \nConsultation  on  cultural  heritage  features;  develop  protocol  in \nconducting  excavation  work  to  ensure  that  any  chance  finds  are \nrecognized \nCMC,  CEA  and  CCD  to  liaise  concerning  practical  aspects  of \nexisting and proposed discharge standards to coastal waters \n\nStrengthening  institutional  capacity  and  operational  capacity  of \nCMC \nContinuous  discharge  of  effluent;  reduce  entry  of  materials; \nincrease  dilution  performance  during \nlow-flow  regimes,  and \nreduced headloss at peak flow; develop outfall operations manual \n\nInstitutional \nResponsibilities  \n\nPMU (M,R,E) \nPMU (M,R,E) \nPMU (M,R,E) \n\nPMU-CMC \n(M,R,E), CEA (E),  \nCCD (E) \nPMU (M, R, E) \n\nPMU (M,R,E) \n\nMark outfall locations; in shallower areas, outfall pipelines must be \nburied; use of fail-safe joints and/or rubber risers \nEstablish institutional prerequisites for source control \nEnforcement  of  pre-treatment;  legal  arrangement  for  inter-agency \nsewer  discharge;  procedures  and  program  of  identification  and \ndealing with illegal connections \nUse corrosion-resistant materials \n\nBan use of asbestos and CFCs, and promote use of pumps from \nmanufacturers  with  a  accredited  EMS  or  EMAS,  or  FSC  certified \nwood \n\nPMU (M, R, E) \n\nPMU (M,R, E) \nPMU (M, R, E) \n\nPMU (M,R,E) \n\nPMU (M, R, E) \n\nresidents  and  Limit  and  control  working  hours,  noise,  dust,  vibration,  PMU (E),  \n\nNoncompliant  discharges  despite \nrehabilitation  \n\nHigh  energy  demands    and  poor \ndilution  due  to  partial  blockage, \nloss,  uneven \nhigh  head \nflow \ndistribution, \nintrusion  of \n  and \nsaltwater and sediments (blocking \nof ports) \nDamage  from  ship  anchors  and \nfishing vessels \nUnacceptable \ndischarges to sewers \n\nindustrial \n\nfrom  salt  and  acid \n\nCorrosion \nattack \nUse  of  substandard  materials \nand/or  materials  with  asbestos, \nCFC, etc \nConstruction Stage \nDisturbance \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPotential Adverse \nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nto  noise,  dust, \n\npublic  due \nvibration, construction traffic \nUse of unapproved materials, e.g. \nrivers, \nsand \nunsustainable \nCFC, \nasbestos \nImproper  disposal  of  construction \nwastes \n\nin \ntimber, \n\nmining \n\nAccidents, \noccupational diseases \n\ninjuries \n\nand \n\ntrenches \n\nin  rainy \n\nFlooding  of \nseason \nLoss of income due to restrictions \non access \nDisruption/interference  to  public \nutilities \nMarine \npollution \nrehabilitation activities \nOperational Stage \nImproper  disposal  of  screenings \n(estimated  per  day  generation: \n340  kg  from  coarse  screens  and \n4 m3 from fine screens  \nAccidents, injuries and diseases \n\nfrom \n\nUse of unapproved pesticides \n\nAppendix 12  57 \n\nInstitutional \nResponsibilities  \n\ncontractor (M,R) \n\nconstruction traffic through contract provisions \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \n\nEnvironmentally Responsible Procurement; Control of construction \nmaterials and sources through contract provisions \n\nPMU (E),  \ncontractor (M,R) \n\nReuse or recycle wastes wherever possible; Coordinate with CMC \nfor  pre-determined  areas  for  disposal  of  spoils.

Comments received will form an \ninput  to  EMP  finalization  following  Project  start-up.  Further  public  consultation  may  be \nundertaken if required by the CEA as part of its project approval conditions. \n \nF. \n \n12. \nThe screening process carried out in the IEE has not identified any significant negative \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Project. Potential negative impacts associated \nwith  construction  activities  can  be  mitigated  by  the  application  of  standard  health,  safety,  and \nenvironmental  clauses  in  contract  documents,  close  supervision,  and  close  attention  to \ntransparency in tendering, and to quality control and supervision on site. Mitigation measures for \nother  impacts  are  provided  in  detail  in  the  IEE.  Once  the  schemes  are  rehabilitated,  it  should \noperate  without  major  environmental  impacts,  providing  CMC  and  the  contractors  follow  the \nO&M procedures prepared during the design stage. The Project will provide CMC and NWSDB \nwith training, and budgets to enable them to fulfill these responsibilities. \n \nThe Project is likely to have significant positive impacts on inland surface waters, public \n13. \nhealth,  and  institutional  development.  The  citizens  of  Greater  Colombo  will  be  the  major \nbeneficiaries of the rehabilitated sewerage system, as human waste from the areas served by \nthe network would be removed rapidly and disposed off in an acceptable manner. This should \nimprove  the  environment  of  these  areas,  and  in  conjunction  with  the  development  of  other \ninfrastructure  (in  particular  water  supply),  should  deliver  major  improvements  in  individual  and \ncommunity health and well-being. The project will improve CMC\u2019s environmental compliance by \nbuilding  a  mechanism  to  monitor  and  comply  with  environmental  regulatory  standards.  The \nProject  will  improve  the  sanitation  service;  the  quality  of  life  should  therefore  improve \nsignificantly.  The  Project  will  conduct  a  program  to  raise  public  awareness  of  sanitation, \nhygiene, and solid wastes issues so the health of the community should also improve.  \n \nG. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  give  rise  to  any  significant  negative  environmental \nimpacts, and therefore does not require an ADB environmental impact assessment. The Project \nwill  significantly  improve  inland  surface  water  quality,  lower  risks  to  public  health  from \nwaterborne  diseases,  and  restore  sea  outfalls  functionality.  Therefore  it  will  have  significant \npositive environmental impacts. \n \n15.  Mitigation of minor adverse impacts can be carried out as an integral part of the Project, \nduring  both  the  detailed  design  and  implementation  stages.  Appropriate  measures  will  be \nincluded in the tender documents for the civil works. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 August 2009) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Sri Lankan rupees (SLRe/SLRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "SLRe 1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0087 \nSLRs114.8 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS  \n", "ADB \nADF \nCDTA \nCEA \nCMC \nDSC \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nIDC \nICB \nIEE \nLIBOR \nMLGPC \nNGO \nNWSDB \nOCR \nO&M \nPCR \nPIU \nPMU \nPSC \nPPMS \nQCBS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \ncapacity development technical assistance \nCentral Environmental Authority \nColombo Municipal Council \ndesign, supervision, and management consultant \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \ninstitutional development consultant \ninternational competitive biding \nInitial environmental examination \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Local Government and Provincial Councils  \nnongovernment organization \nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board \nordinary capital resources \noperation and maintenance \nproject completion report \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nproject steering committee \nproject performance management system \nquality- and cost-based selection \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Sri Lanka and its agencies ends on 31 \nDecember.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n", "X.
