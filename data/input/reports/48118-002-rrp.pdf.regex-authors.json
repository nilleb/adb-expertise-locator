THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) four proposed \nloans to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), the \nRepublic of the Union of Myanmar, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam; and (ii) a proposed \ngrant to the Lao PDR for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Health Security Project.1 \n \n2.  The project builds on previous and ongoing interventions focusing on communicable \ndisease  control  (CDC)  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.2 This  project  includes \nMyanmar and focuses on the four countries\u2019 health system strengthening, including regional \ncooperation; surveillance and outbreak response; laboratory quality and biosafety; and hospital \ninfection prevention and control (IPC).3 \n   \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic growth in the GMS is highly vulnerable to outbreaks of emerging diseases, \nsuch  as  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome,  avian  influenza,  and  Middle  East  respiratory \nsyndrome.4 Traditional communicable diseases, including drug-resistant malaria, dengue, and \nantimicrobial-resistant infections, also have a significant economic impact. Multiple factors play \na role in spreading communicable diseases across borders, including an increasingly mobile \npopulation,  increasing  trade,  and  intensified  interaction  between  people  and  animals. \nParticularly at risk are the poor, ethnic groups, and those living in border and remote areas or \nliving along economic corridors.  \n \n4.   Health  systems  weaknesses  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam \n(CLMV) are a threat to health security in the GMS, one of the targets of the United Nations \nsustainable development goals for the health sector.5  The project will address key binding \nconstraints in the countries\u2019 health system and promote cross-country cooperation aimed at \nimproving both national and international health security. \n \n5.   Countries can take advantage of synergies from coordination. In recent years, health \nauthorities  in  GMS  countries  have  made  significant  progress  in  this  arena.  Cross-border \ncollaboration (which includes joint outbreak investigation, information exchange, and patient \nreferrals) between neighboring provinces across international borders is gaining momentum. \nHowever,  these  activities  need  to  be  further  integrated  and  normalized  into  routine  CDC \nactivities. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project. Manila; ADB. \n2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grants to the \nKingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the \nSecond Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Project. Manila. \n3  ADB provided a project preparatory technical assistance. \n4  The cost of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in terms of lost gross domestic product, \nmeasured in nominal terms, is estimated at $18 billion for the East Asian and Southeast Asian economies. \n5  Health security is achieved through a set of activities, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute \npublic health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. ", "2 \n6.   Health service networks within CLMV have expanded rapidly, but marginalized, mobile, \nand  poor  people  still  have  limited  access  to  health  services.  Mobile  populations,  ethnic \nminorities, and other vulnerable groups (MEVs) and populations living in remote border areas \nare more susceptible to infectious diseases and yet tend to use health services less than the \ngeneral population. Cross-border migrant workers returning home with HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis \ninfection have limited access to treatment. Disease control programs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria are in place but often do not reach these vulnerable groups in border areas due to \nstaff and funding constraints. Consequently, in CLMV, up to one-third of tuberculosis cases are \nnot identified, and one-third of diagnosed tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS cases are not properly \ntreated.6 \n \n7.   The ministries of health (MOHs) in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam \nhave  implemented  surveillance  systems  for  notifiable  diseases  and  syndromic  reporting  to \nimprove reporting of events and identification of cases from the community level.7 However, the \ndisease surveillance system needs further digitalization and extension to all health centers, and \nsyndromic reporting needs to be rolled out nationally. Linkages and integration between disease \nsurveillance, district health management information, and zoonotic disease surveillance needs \nto be improved.8 Health authorities in CLMV have to increase their capacities for risk analysis \ndata management, community preparedness, and disease outbreak response. Outbreak district \nresponse  teams  are  often  poorly  equipped  and  financed,  and  need  capacity  building  on \noutbreak investigation and management. \n  \n8.   Past investments have improved laboratory services in provincial hospitals. In contrast, \ndistrict  hospital  laboratories  are  unable  to  comply  with  internationally  acceptable  biosafety \nstandards or to guarantee the accuracy of their laboratory tests. Underlying problems include \nsubstandard  training  of  laboratory  staff,  and  insufficient  equipment  and  supplies.  Formal \nprocesses  for  internal  and  external  quality  assurance  are  lacking.  Laboratory  auditing  for \ncompliance with quality and safety guidelines does not exist. \n  \n9.   Hospitals and health centers are most likely to receive patients with emerging infectious \ndiseases, but IPC practices in health facilities are substandard. Hospital sanitation and hygiene \nfacilities are lacking. Hospital medical waste management is often unsatisfactory. The general \npublic has almost unrestricted access to infectious patients\u2019 wards. Such practices may result in \nineffective treatment, the spread of infectious diseases, increased hospital-acquired infections, \nand development of drug resistance. \n \n10.   The governments have demonstrated strong commitment and leadership towards the \ncontrol of emerging infectious diseases and other diseases of regional importance. National \npolicies and plans are in place to deal with these major health threats. CLMV have stepped up \ndomestic financing and mobilization of external assistance to improve cross-border cooperation. \nCLMV are committed to achieve standards based on the International Health Regulations, 2005, \nin  line  with  the  strategic  framework  of  the  Asia  Pacific  Strategy  for  Emerging  Diseases \n(APSED), 2010, both of the World Health Organization (WHO). 9 The APSED, 2010 includes \neight  focus  areas:  (i)  regional  preparedness,  alert,  and  response;  (ii)  surveillance,  risk \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016.

The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nrecommends expanding operations in the health sector to 3%\u20135% of ADB\u2019s annual approvals.10 \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.11 The project is \nincluded in the GMS Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan, 2014\u20132018; and is \naligned with the CLMV country partnership strategies.12 The project is included in the current \ncountry operations business plans of CLMV.13 The project addresses regional public goods as \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration strategy.14 ADB has supported several \nloans and grants focusing on CDC (footnote 2); multiple loans, grants, and technical assistance \nprojects focusing  on  HIV/AIDS;  and  a  number  of grants  and  technical  assistance  projects \nfocusing on malaria15 financed from ADB\u2019s Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease \nThreats Trust Fund under the Health Financing Partnership Facility.16  \n \n12.   Lessons  learned  from  previous  and  current  interventions  include  the  following:              \n(i) district hospitals are better positioned than provincial hospitals to conduct CDC activities;    \n(ii) strengthening the health system is more important than focusing on a single disease; (iii) the \nprovision of laboratory equipment must be accompanied by measures improving quality and \naccuracy of diagnostics; (iv) IPC in the district hospitals is essential for effective and prompt \ncontrol of outbreaks; and (v) the support for regional cooperation has to be aligned with existing \nregional frameworks such as the APSED  \n \n13.   Other development partners that play an important role in CDC include the United States \nAgency for International Development, which is rolling out the Global Health Security Agenda; \nthe  Global  Fund  to  Fight  HIV/AIDS,  Tuberculosis,  and  Malaria;  the  Three  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal Fund in Myanmar; WHO for CDC technical support; the Global Alliance for \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2014.

The project will complement these \nexisting interventions by (i) addressing gaps in laboratory diagnostic capacity in hospital IPC in \nremote area, (ii) strengthening the health system generally rather than concentrating on disease \nspecific  interventions,  and  (iii)  fostering  regional  cooperation  for  public  goods.  Further,  as \nCLMV\u2019s national income per capita increases, future financing by the Global Fund to Fight \nHIV/AIDS,  Tuberculosis,  and  Malaria,  and  bilateral  development  partners  is  uncertain  and \nADB\u2019s support seeks to fill this impending gap.  \n \nB.   Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact will be GMS public health security strengthened. The outcome will be GMS \nhealth system performance with regard to health security improved. The project locations are \nselected provinces along borders and economic corridors. In these locations, health facilities \ntypically serve the local population as well as mobile and migrant populations. The selection \ncriteria for project provinces, states, and regions are (i) high poverty incidence; (ii) high burden \nof communicable disease; (iii) high regional risk of disease outbreaks; and (v) limited support \nfrom other development partners. The project will cover 13 provinces in Cambodia, 12 provinces \nin the Lao PDR, five states and regions in Myanmar, and 36 provinces in Viet Nam.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The project will have three outputs:  \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Regional  cooperation  and  communicable  disease  control  in \nborder areas improved. This output will strengthen APSED focus areas 1, 3, \nand 4 (para. 10). Under this output, the project will strengthen (i) regional, cross-\nborder, and intersectoral information sharing and coordination of outbreak control \namong  GMS  countries;  (ii)  regional  capacity  for  evidence-based  CDC;  (iii) \ndevelopment of better disease control strategies for MEVs in border areas; and \n(iv) improved CDC services for MEVs in hotspots along economic corridors in \ntargeted border areas. The project will provide technical expertise and funding, to \nimprove information exchange between CLMV countries and foster intersectoral \ncollaboration. The project will finance cross-border activities (including simulation \nexercises, and joint outbreak investigation and control), and outreach activities \ntargeting MEVs. The regional coordination unit, hosted by the MOH of the Lao \nPDR and financed under a regional technical assistance project, will provide \ntechnical support to CLMV for information exchange, disease control strategies \nfor MEVs, and organization of regional events.18 \n \n                                                \n17 Project provinces in Cambodia: Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampot, Kandal, Kratie, Mondulkiri, Pailin, Preah \nVihear, Prey Veng, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Svay Rieng, and Tbong Khmum.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The MOHs in CLMV will be the executing agencies in each country. The executing \nagency has overall responsibility for in-country project implementation and coordination among \ncountries.  Each  executing  agency  has  a  senior  official  as  a  project  director  for  project \nmanagement and liaison with ADB. The GMS Health Security Regional Steering Committee will \nguide project implementation, policy dialogue, building of regional capacity and cooperation for \nCDC. It will be chaired by the minister or vice-minister of the host country and will consist of \nrepresentatives  from  the  MOHs,  ADB,  and  WHO.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  Technical  challenges  at  the  regional  level  include  (i)  ensuring  leadership  for \nstrengthening  regional  and  cross-border  cooperation,  (ii)  implementing  costly  and  complex \nstrategies to improve health service access for MEVs in border areas, and (iii) implementing \nappropriate  strategies  for  quality  improvement  of  laboratory  services  and  improvement  of \ninfection control in hospitals. The project provides for capacity building and support in these \nareas. WHO will provide technical support and training for disease control strategies, quality \ncontrol of laboratories, and improvement of IPC in hospitals. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic rationale for investing in the project lies in the nature of health security \nbeing a regional public good. CDC interventions including public education, epidemiological \nsurveillance,  cross-border  vector  control,  and  regional  cooperation  positively  impact  labor \nproductivity and directly reduce the burden of disease for individuals and households. The \neconomic internal rate of return on the project investment is estimated to be 21.8% over a 10-\nyear benefit stream for CLMV combined. The economic benefits accrue from (i) a narrowing of \nthe health status and disease incidence gaps between target areas and the rest of country, (ii) \naversion  or  mitigation  of  epidemic  outbreaks  as  a  percentage  of  national  gross  domestic \nproduct, and (iii) effective lab testing and subsequent treatment of particular communicable \ndiseases (e.g., dengue). Recurrent costs are assumed not to decline in the 5 years following \nproject implementation but represent less than 0.27% of projected annual government health \nexpenditure in CLMV. Given this small percentage and the headroom for expanding government \nhealth  expenditure,  the  project  is  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable  in  all  four \ncountries. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Fiduciary risk in the health sector of the four countries has been assessed as high in \nMyanmar,  substantial  in  Cambodia,  and  moderate  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam.  The \nprocurement risk assessment is considered high in the Lao PDR and Myanmar, and moderate \nin Viet Nam and Cambodia. The MOHs in CLMV lack the necessary human resources for \nprocurement and financial management. However the MOHs of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam have gained substantial experience in implementing ADB-assisted projects over the \nyears and have staff trained in ADB procedures. Myanmar MOH has limited experience in ADB \nstandards for financial management and procurement, so the staff will receive training in ADB \nprocedures. The CLMV governments have given assurances that capable government staff will \nbe appointed in a timely manner. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare in the project administration manual (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.   Neglected  communicable  diseases,  along  with  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis,  and  malaria \ncontribute as a group to the top ten factors of burden of disease.21 The poor especially suffer \n                                                \n21 World Health Organization. 2010.

The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction primarily by preventing the spread of communicable diseases and major epidemics, \nand improving access to diagnostics and treatment, thus reducing medical expenses, morbidity, \nmortality, and related household impact. \n \n27.   Multiple factors limit women\u2019s access to and affordability of health services, including \ncultural  perceptions,  travel  distance,  potential  safety  risks,  and  financial  resources.  Health \nservices do not sufficiently consider the specific needs of women. The current surveillance \nsystem does not include the reporting of sex-disaggregated data. The project is categorized as \neffective gender mainstreaming as it will directly improve women\u2019s access to health services. To \nensure the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming and gender-related outcomes in the project, \nMOHs in CLMV will implement the gender action plan.22 The gender mainstreaming actions \ninclude (i) strengthening national sex-disaggregated surveillance systems; (ii) conducting CDC \noutreach activities targeting women and girls with gender-sensitive materials; and (iii) ensuring \nparticipation of female health staff in training, and in regional workshops.. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  The project is classified as category B for indigenous peoples. Ethnic minorities in the \nproject areas will be positively affected as they will have better access to improved health \nservices. An indigenous peoples development plan has been prepared for each country, and \nincludes measures to ensure ethnic minority groups benefit from the project. The project is \nclassified as category C for involuntary resettlement. There will be no construction of new health \nfacilities or extension of existing health facilities, and no land acquisition is required. Screening \nduring the selection of health facilities to be refurbished will rule out proposed sites, which \nrequire land acquisition and have resettlement impacts. The project is classified as category B \nfor environment, as the project has components dealing with laboratory biohazards and hospital \nsolid and liquid waste management. Mitigation measures are included in the environmental \nmanagement plan to address minor environmental risks. An initial environmental examination \nand an environmental assessment and review framework have been prepared. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The risk for the project is assessed as medium in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam, and high in Myanmar. Major risks include (i) insufficient administrative capacity for project-\nrelated financial management and procurement; (ii) complexity of financial management linked \nto the large number of implementing agencies; and (iii) limited health human resources for \nlaboratory improvements and IPC activities. Mitigation measures include (i) involving provinces, \nregions, and states in the preparation of annual operation plans; (ii) hiring consultants for initial \ntechnical  and  administrative  assistance  and  producing  financial  management  manuals;  (iii) \ntraining project staff; and (iv) conducting all procurement activities at the central government \nlevel. In addition, the MOH of Myanmar will be assisted with up-front financial management and \nprocurement  consultants  and  training  by  ADB.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the risks of the project. Major risks and mitigating measures are described \nin detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 23  \n \n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n   \n30.  The governments and the MOHs of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam \nhave assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB \npolicies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, \nconsulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual and loan documents.
