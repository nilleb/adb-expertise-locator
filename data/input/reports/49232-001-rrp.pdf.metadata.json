The program will \n(i) reduce emissions from major air pollution sources, (ii) strengthen environment policy and the \ninstitutional  framework  for  implementation,  and  (iii)  enhance  employment  support  for  inclusive \nindustrial  transformation.  The  program  will  provide  HPG  with  a  solid  basis  to  introduce \nincremental reforms under the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, while enabling HPG to \nconsolidate and accelerate necessary actions during 2015\u20132016. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  constraints. In 2013, the BTH region, with a population of 109.2 million, \ngenerated a gross domestic product (GDP) of CNY6.2 trillion, accounting for 10% of the national \ntotal. While the region is an engine of socioeconomic development for the PRC, poor air quality \njeopardizes  its  sustainable  growth.2 The  concentrations  of  sulfur  and  nitrogen  oxides,  ozone, \nand inhalable particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) reached levels \nthat  may  cause  significant  public  health  impacts. 3  In  2014,  the  annual  average  PM2.5 \nconcentration  was  93.0  micrograms/cubic  meter,  several  times  higher  than  in  cities  of \ndeveloped  countries. 4  In  the  BTH  region,  PM2.5  is  locally  generated  and  formed  in  the \natmosphere  by  emissions  from  (i)  industries,  (ii)  continuous  coal  burning  for  electricity \ngeneration and heating boilers in urban and rural areas, (iii) increasing motor vehicle emissions, \nand  (iv)  the  burning  of  agricultural  biomass  waste.  The  topographical  and  meteorological \ncharacteristics of the region are also conducive to the buildup of air pollution. While air pollution \nhas been a common environmental problem for many developed countries as their economies \ndeveloped over spans of 40\u201350 years, the situation for the BTH region is unique. As part of a \nfast-developing upper middle-income country, the region is undergoing unprecedented rates of \ngrowth  that  make  the  area  simultaneously  experience  various  types  of  air  pollution  resulting \nfrom industrialization, urbanization, and motorization.5  \n\n                                                \n1  The concept paper was circulated to the Board of Directors on 4 September 2015. ADB. 2015. Proposed Policy-\nBased  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China:  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Air  Quality Improvement  Program.  Manila. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n2   Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. 2014. Better Growth Better Climate. Washington, DC. In 2010, \noutdoor  air  pollution  in  the  PRC  was  estimated  to  cause  1.3  million  premature  deaths  per  year,  and  economic \nlosses of 9.7%\u201313.2% of national GDP. \n\n3   Among  the  pollutants,  PM2.5  has  the  most  severe  impact  on  public  health.  The  World  Health  Organization \nconcludes  that  no  amount  of  PM2.5  is  safe.  An  epidemiological  study  by  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Sciences  in \nBeijing showed the correlation between levels of ambient particulate matter and mortality from cardiovascular and \nrespiratory diseases. The results confirm research findings from the United States and Europe. \n\n4   The  new  air  quality  standard  for  PM2.5  in  the  PRC  (GB  3095-2012)  is  still  35  micrograms/cubic  meter  (\u00b5g/m3), \n\ncompared with 15 \u00b5g/m3 for the United States and Japan, and 10 \u00b5g/m3 for the World Health Organization. \n\n5   Ambient  air  pollution  follows  the  typical  pattern  of  socioeconomic  development,  from  industrialization-related \nprimary  pollutants  (e.g.,  sulfur  oxides and  particulate matter)  to  urbanization-  and motorization-related  secondary \npollutants  (e.g.,  nitrogen  oxides  and  photochemical  oxidants).  In  the  BTH  region,  air  emissions  from  all  sources \ncoexist and escalate public health impacts. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAn  imbalanced  socioeconomic  structure  in  the  BTH  region  has  made  Hebei  the  main \n4. \nsource  of  air  pollution  and  a  clear  bottleneck  for  air  pollution  control.  Despite  the  geographic \nadvantage  of  encompassing  Beijing  and  Tianjin,  Hebei\u2019s  vast  peri-urban  and  rural  area \nsubstantially lags in socioeconomic development. In 2014, Hebei\u2019s GDP per capita was $6,509, \nmore than 14% below the national average of $7,592, and only 40% of Beijing\u2019s GDP and 38% \nof  Tianjin\u2019s  GDP.  About  88%  of  the  3.1  million  poor  in the  region  live  in  Hebei.  While  Hebei\u2019s \nabundant land resources and inexpensive laborers firmly support the overall development of the \nBTH  region,  Hebei\u2019s  economy  relies  heavily  on  polluting  secondary  industries\u2014coal-fired \nenergy  generation,  iron,  steel,  coking,  and  cement.  Their  contribution  to  the  provincial  GDP \nincreased  from  50.3%  in  2000  to  52.2%  in  2013.  During  the  same  period,  Beijing  and  Tianjin \ngradually transformed their industrial structure to tertiary service industries. In 2014, 7 of the 10 \ncities with the worst air quality in the PRC were in Hebei.  Hebei emits more than 80% of total \nprimary PM2.5 in the BTH region, and three times more nitrogen oxides\u2014one of the precursors \nof secondary PM2.5\u2014than the total of Beijing and Tianjin. To improve the region\u2019s air quality, the \nfirst  priority  is  to  address  Hebei\u2019s  problems,  while  improving  coordination  of  air  quality \nimprovement efforts in the region. \n \n5. \nGovernment  efforts  and  challenges. As a national priority, the central government is \nscaling up its efforts to address this environmental challenge together with climate change.6 The \nnational  air  quality  standards  were  updated  in  2012  to  be  equivalent  with  those  in  most \ndeveloped  countries.  The  new  environmental  protection  law  came  into  force  in  2015.  In  2013, \nthe  State  Council  issued  the  Action  Plan  on  Prevention  and  Control  of  Air  Pollution,  2013\u2013\n2017.7 In 2013\u20132014, the central government budgeted CNY15 billion to improve the air quality \nin  six  northeastern  provinces,  including  the  BTH  region.  The  governments  of  Beijing,  Tianjin, \nand Hebei formulated their own plans for air pollution prevention and control for 2013\u20132017. In \nthe five-year Hebei Clean Air Action Plan (HCAAP), HPG commits to reduce by 2017 (i) PM2.5 \nconcentration  by  25%  from  the  2012  level,  (ii)  steel-making  production  capacity  by  60  million \ntons, (iii) cement production capacity by 60 million tons, (iv) coal consumption by 40 million tons, \nand  (v)  glass  production  capacity  by  38  million  weight  boxes.8 By  the  end  of  2014,  Hebei  had \nreduced steel-making capacity by 15 million tons, cement production by 39.2 million tons, and \ncoal consumption by 15 million tons. \n \nThe  introduction  of  the  HCAAP  and  urgent  air  pollution  mitigation  requirements  led  to \n6. \nHebei\u2019s  fragmented  policy  framework.  Pollution  reduction  efforts  during  2013\u20132014  only \nresulted  in  several  short-term  \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d  policy  actions  and  the  strengthening  of  legal \nenforcement  against  polluting  industries  to  reduce  production  capacity  and  the  number  of  old \nvehicles.9 In  2014,  Hebei  was  the  PRC\u2019s  second-largest  coal  consumer  with  90%  of  energy \n\n                                                \n6   The PRC government recognizes that  actions for air pollution control will  reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). The \nSeptember 2015 joint presidential statement of the United States and the PRC on climate change, and the PRC \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change indicate the PRC's commitment to lower its 2015 carbon dioxide emissions per unit \nof GDP by 60%\u201365% by 2030. This will be achieved through various measures, including power generation with \nhigher efficiency and lower GHG emissions, low-carbon city development, promotion of public transportation, and \nfuel-efficiency standards on heavy-duty vehicles. \n\n7  Government of the PRC. 2013. Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, 2013\u20132017. Beijing. \n8   The action plan identifies more than 50 measures. The direct measures for air pollution control include (i) industrial \npollution control; (ii) point and area source emission control; (iii) vehicle and mobile source pollution prevention and \ncontrol; (iv) fuel switch and upgrade and/or phase out of coal-fired boilers; (v) adjustment of energy structure and \npromotion of clean energy; and (iv) air quality and pollution monitoring, capacity building, and training. The indirect \nmeasures include (i) optimizing industrial layout, and (ii) supporting technology transformation and innovation. \n\n9   \u201cEnd-of-pipe\u201d  policy  actions  address  the  end  of  the  process  stream,  such  as  the  installation  of  pollution  control \n\ndevices. They can be effective for quick outcomes but do not address the fundamental issues. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nsupplied  by  coal,  much  higher  than  the  national  average  of  about  70%.  During  2013\u20132014, \ntransport policies did not target the key issue of the increasing number of motor vehicles. Both \nurban and rural areas depend on old and inefficient infrastructure for cooking and heating. The \nexisting policies offered few alternatives to the seasonal burning of agricultural biomass waste. \nTo remove constraints and enhance long-term development prospects, Hebei needs (i) a basic \nand  comprehensive  policy  framework,  (ii)  well-coordinated  actions  to  gradually  enhance \npolicies, (iii) investments to better manage air pollution reduction efforts, and (iv) private sector \nparticipation in financing necessary investments for industrial modernization.  \n \n7. \nA weak environmental institutional framework for policy enforcement and an incomplete \nset of regulations constrain comprehensive control of air pollution in Hebei. Unlike in Beijing and \nTianjin,  Hebei  does not regulate  volatile organic compounds (VOCs),  a key  pollutant for  PM2.5 \nand ozone. The vast coverage area and lack of systematic information collection and analytical \ncapacity make the formulation of policies and actions that effectively target key pollution sources \ndifficult. Hebei has issued a series of policies and environmental standards to control industrial \nair pollution, but inadequate institutional capacity to enforce regulatory compliance is a barrier to \na fair and transparent approach to control air pollution. \n \n8. \nWhile reducing the capacity of polluting industries is an effective measure to mitigate air \npollution,  policy  reform  must  be  considered  in  the  context  of  medium-  to  long-term  industrial \ntransformation and inclusive socioeconomic development. Industries in Hebei provide a number \nof job opportunities to local skilled and unskilled laborers. Air pollution control measures need to \nconsider  social  aspects  as  its  integral  part  because  industrial  transformation  may  not  be \nsuccessful  without  an  adequate  and  inclusive  social  protection  system  and  employment \nopportunities to support affected laborers during the socioeconomic transition. \n \n9. \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s policy dialogue. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen a main development partner of Hebei since 1998.10 Through technical assistance in 2002\u2013\n2005, ADB supported the development of Hebei\u2019s provincial development strategy to accelerate \nits  economic  integration  with  Beijing  and  Tianjin.  The  strategy  emphasizes  the  need  for \nstructural  reforms  to  promote  (i)  ecological  and  environmental  sustainability  of  BTH  regional \ndevelopment, (ii) greater economic cooperation with Beijing and Tianjin, (iii) pro-poor economic \ndevelopment, and (iv) an enabling investment environment for the private sector. Two ongoing \nloan projects\u2014Hebei Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector Project, and \nHebei  Energy  Efficiency  Improvement  and  Emission  Reduction  Project\u2014are  financing  needed \ninfrastructure, and contributing to air quality improvement by reducing coal usage by inefficient \nheating boilers in cities and improving energy efficiency in key industries. \n  \n10. \nIn 2014, poor air quality in the BTH region indicated that the 2013\u20132014 pollution control \nmeasures  were  insufficient.  Since  mid-2014,  policy  dialogue  has  intensified  and  identified \nmissing  links  to  build  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  to  promote  coordinated  actions  and \ninvestments for air pollution reduction. Importantly, it emphasized the need to address not only \nshort-term  air  pollution  control,  but  develop  a  solid  basis  to  continue  with  incremental  policy \nreforms  under  the  PRC\u2019s  13th  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  and  support  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  over  the  medium-  to  long-term.  This  will  enable  Hebei  to  move  from  being  a \n\n                                                \n10  ADB. 2002.

ADB  collaborates  with  other  international \ndevelopment  partners to  leverage  the  impact  of policy  advisory  and financial  support. German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  KfW became a cofinancier  of  the  program. The World  Bank \nproposes to support HCAAP implementation through a $500 million program-for-results lending \nmodality in parallel with the ADB program.12 In addition to past technical assistance and ongoing \nloan  projects,  Hebei  requires  a  comprehensive  assistance  package  during  the  remaining \nHCAAP implementation period of 2015\u20132017 with increased financing. This will enable HPG to \n(i)  strengthen  the  framework  for  incremental  policy  and  investment  actions  to  meet  short-, \nmedium-, and long-term development objectives; and (ii) scale up air pollution control in 2015\u2013\n2017. This is systematically addressed by closely coordinated ADB\u2013KfW\u2013World Bank financial \nassistance:  a  PBL  loan  provided  by  ADB\u2013KfW  in  2015\u20132016  and  a  program-for-results  loan \nprovided by the World Bank in 2016\u20132017. ADB will be responsible for up-front policy reforms \nby  building  on  its  comparable  advantage  as  the  only  international  financial  partner  that  has \nworked  on  Hebei\u2019s  provincial  development  strategy.  The  single-tranche  PBL  will  immediately \nand effectively respond to Hebei\u2019s urgent policy reform and financial needs in 2015\u20132016, while \nthe World  Bank  loan  will  support  HPG\u2019s  achievements  of  key  results  in  2016\u20132017.  The  ADB \nand the World Bank programs are designed to fully complement each other.13 \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  includes  (i)  providing  technical  advice  on \npolicy  actions  to  bridge  policy  gaps,  achieve  higher  targets,  and  accelerate  reforms;  \n(ii)  developing  stronger  institutional  coordination  in  HPG  through  a  socially  inclusive  industrial \ntransformation process as a part of important air pollution control efforts; (iii) gaining co-benefits \nfrom  air  pollution  reduction  and  climate  change  mitigation;  and  (iv)  coordinating  multi-  and \nbilateral development partners to scale up effectiveness of policy advice on air pollution control. \n \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategy. The program supports the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan, \n13. \n2011\u20132015  on  environmental  improvement;  this  is  expected  to  continue  during  the  13th  Five-\nYear  Plan. 14  The  program  is  (i)  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  current  and  draft  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2016\u20132020  for  the  PRC;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  paper  on  a  new  partnership  with  upper  middle-\nincome countries; and (iii) ADB\u2019s operational directions for investing in environmental goods and \nservices for future economic growth.15  \n \n\n                                                \n11 In parallel with an overall shift from secondary to tertiary industry, HPG aims to develop a less-polluting secondary \nindustry  including  new  energy  industry  (e.g.,  photovoltaic  power  generation),  electric  vehicle,  information \ntechnology, and environmental equipment manufacturing.  \n\n12 The World Bank\u2019s program-for-results lending is similar to ADB\u2019s results-based lending, providing financial support \n\nbased on the achievement of pre-agreed results or key development indicators. \n\n13 The World  Bank\u2019s  program  design  includes  indicators  on  (i)  pollution  control  technologies  in  selected  industries,  \n(ii) the phaseout of old polluting vehicles, (iii) deployment of an energy-efficient clean biomass stove in rural areas, \nand (iv) enhancement of the air pollution monitoring network and its analytical protocol. The end-of-pipe measures \nto  cut  industrial  air  pollution  are  better  supported  by  the  program-for-results  loan,  while  the  program  enables \nappropriate  means  to  achieve  such  results  through  issuing  new  policies  and  action  plans,  and  exploring  better \nincentive schemes to accelerate the reform agenda. \n\n14 In 2014, ADB provided the National Development and Reform Commission with a set of recommendations on eight \n\nkey development challenges to be addressed under the 13th Five-Year Plan. \n\n15 ADB.  2012.

Lessons from sector experience in the PRC include (i) the need for continuous \n14. \npolicy  dialogue  for  medium-  and  long-term  development  objectives,  and  (ii)  consideration  of \nappropriate  incentives  and  measures  to  ensure  financial  viability  and  consumer  affordability. \nPBLs  in  other  developing  member  countries  provide  valuable  lessons,  including  (i)  ensuring \nidentifying \nimpacts  of  policy  reforms  by \nappropriate interventions to operationalize policy reforms in the field, and (iii) focusing on policy \nactions  on  which  ADB  has  strong  sector  expertise  and  experience.  These  lessons  were \nincorporated  to  the  program  design.  Performance  indicators  to  measure  effectiveness  of  the \npolicy  reform  are  included  in  the  policy  matrix.  Proposed  technical  assistance  projects  will  be \nintegrated to support implementation of the agreed policy actions, and monitor and evaluate the \nperformance, while strengthening air pollution control coordination in the BTH region.16 \n \nB. \n\nidentifying  performance-based  measures,  (ii) \n\nImpacts and Outcome  \n\nOutputs \n\nThe impacts will be reduced air pollution and improved public health in the BTH region. \n15. \nThe outcome will be a strengthened framework for incremental policy and investment actions in \nHebei  to  improve air quality  in  the  BTH  region. The  17  policy  actions  were  agreed  and  will  be \ncompleted by March 2016. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nOutput 1: Policies and actions to reduce air pollution from key sectors issued and \napproved. Policy actions will guide future investments to transform Hebei\u2019s economic structure \nto  be  more  environment-friendly.  Policies  will  include  (i) adjusting  the  energy  structure  by \nreducing coal consumption and promoting clean energy, (ii) promoting public transport in urban \nareas, and (iii) reducing seasonal biomass burning and promoting clean energy in rural areas.  \n \n17. \nThe policy reform to switch from coal to cleaner energy adopts an integrated approach to \naddress  aspects  of  supply  and  demand.  For  the  supply  side,  policy  dialogue  identified  the \nimportance of  early  deployment  of  natural gas  as  a key  to trigger fuel  switch. The  natural gas \ndevelopment plan will be issued with appropriate financial support to accelerate deployment of \ncleaner energy in Hebei. Another policy will increase the amount of recovery, quality standard, \nand financial viability of synthetic gas recycled from coke oven flue gas to be used for heating \ngeneration  and  a  cleaner  energy  source\u2014important  as  Hebei  is  the  second  largest  coke \nproducer in the PRC. For the demand side, HPG will improve the monitoring and supervision of \nmunicipal coal reduction by imposing annual quantitative targets for all municipal governments \nduring 2015\u20132017. Key emission sources of coal-based boilers and their heating service (main \nsource  of  pollution  in  winter)  will  be  addressed  by  phasing  out  and  replacing  small,  obsolete, \nand  energy-inefficient  coal-fired  boilers  with  centralized  heating  systems  and  boilers  using \ncleaner  energy.  The  policy  will  be  accompanied  by  a  comprehensive  study  of  appropriate \nfinancial and market-based mechanisms to support the deployment. This will ensure that Hebei \nresidents, including the poor, can enjoy affordable and cleaner heating service during the winter. \n \n18. \nPromotion  of  public  transport  in  urban  areas  is  an  important  medium-  to  long-term \nobjective  to  develop  an  environment-friendly  city  and  to  improve  quality  of  life.  Although  less \npronounced, emissions from mobile sources are becoming more evident in Hebei, following the \nsame paths of Beijing and Tianjin. The 2013\u20132014 provincial program successfully phased out \nold vehicles that do not meet the emission standard. However, policy reform is needed to trigger \n\n                                                \n16 The  proposed  technical  assistance  projects  are  the  Study  on  the  Coordinated  Development  of  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\n\nHebei and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Regional Air Pollution Control. \n\n \n\n\fa fundamental shift from private to public transport in cities.  Reduced motor vehicle emissions \nwill  significantly  reduce  black  carbon,  one  component  of  PM2.5 and  an  agent  that  significantly \ncontributes to climate change. The new policy will apply a uniform standard to assess, evaluate, \nand  compare the  status of  public transport  in  cities,  thereby  raising  the awareness of  decision \nmakers on the importance of urban public transport in their cities. \n\n \n19. \nPolicy  reform  is  also  needed  to  reduce  seasonal  biomass  burning  and  promote  clean \nenergy  in  rural  areas.  In  Hebei,  86.5%  of  biomass  stalk  is  collected,  but  only  10.0%  of  that  is \nused  to  recover  energy.  Policy  dialogue  confirms  that  after  optimizing  the  use  of  biomass \nresources, a higher energy recovery target is feasible, and should be supported by an effective \nincentive  scheme,  especially  to  make  the  biomass  briquette  a  preferable  choice  of  energy \nsource  in  rural  areas.  The  agreed  policy  actions  represent  an  integrated  approach  to  (i)  ban \nbiomass burning for air pollution reduction, (ii) promote the beneficial use of biomass resources \nto replace coal, (iii) commit to a higher energy recovery target and set clear objectives, and (iv) \nprovide appropriate financial support for policy implementation. \n \nOutput  2:  Environmental  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  implementation \n20. \nstrengthened. Policy actions will assist Hebei in (i) enhancing the legal and policy framework, \n(ii)  developing  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  analytical  system,  and  (iii)  strengthening \nregulatory enforcement capacity in the field of environment. The HCAAP specifies measures to \ncomply with national targets. More than 50 policy documents have resulted from action plans to \nupgrade Hebei\u2019s regulatory framework to reduce air pollution. Despite the effort to align Hebei\u2019s \nstandards with those enacted in Beijing and Tianjin, gaps  remain concerning complex sources \nof  air  pollution,  such  as  VOCs  from  industrial  and  domestic  point  sources,  and  high  diesel \nvehicle emissions from mobile sources. The first VOC emission standard, with limits comparable \nto  those  in  Beijing  and  Tianjin,  will  be  issued  for  key  industry  sectors.  A  study  will  be \ncommissioned on diesel vehicle emission control, one of the untouched but key mobile emission \nsources  of  particulate  matter.  Regulations  on  air  pollution  prevention  and  control  will  be \nimproved, focusing on (i) plans and targets for VOC emission control, (ii) regional mechanisms \nfor unified prevention and control in the BTH region, and (iii) legal responsibilities of county and \nmore senior government departments and bureaus for air pollution prevention and control. \n \nHPG established the Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center and the Environmental \n21. \nEmergency and Early Warning Center to monitor and analyze ambient air quality and prevent, \nforecast, and respond to heavy pollution episodes. However, the monitoring is still not adequate \nto properly understand and analyze local and regional pollution dispersion patterns. The system \ncoverage  and  capacity  must  be  enhanced  for  almost  all  aspects  of  monitoring,  modeling,  and \nforecasting technologies and their operation. HPG has committed to upgrade its air quality audit, \nincluding  the  monitoring  of  ammonia,  VOCs,  heavy  metals,  and  elemental  and/or  organic \ncarbon.  The  industry  regulatory  compliance  monitoring  system  needs  to  be  strengthened  by \ninstalling continuous emission monitoring devices in an additional 1,000 key polluting sources. \n \n22. \nDespite  government  efforts  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Environmental  Protection \nDepartment  (EPD),  its  regulatory  enforcement  must  be  improved.  The  dialogue  identified  an \neffective  approach  to  address  the  challenge.  The  government  will  issue  a  policy  to  (i)  raise \nawareness  and  strengthen  environmental  accountability  among  key  government  decision \nmakers  in  Hebei;  and  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  local  EPDs,  the  Provincial  Environmental \nMonitoring Center, and the Environmental Emergency and Early Warning Center on the use of \nmonitoring  equipment  and  interpretation  of  data  for  improved  analytical  work  and  regulatory \nenforcement for counties and townships. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nOutput 3: Employment promotion for inclusive industrial transformation enhanced. \n23. \nThe policy action will ensure that workers will be supported during the industrial transformation \nprocess.  HPG  has  issued  policies  to  strengthen the  social  security  programs  and  the financial \nbasis  of  these  policies,  including  enhanced  unemployment  insurance  and  support  for \nenterprises  to  retain  their  employees.  During  PBL  processing,  dialogue  confirmed  the \nimportance of training, particularly the provision and quality of training that provides employment \noptions to worker. The scope of such policy reform must be holistic and align with the objectives \nof  industrial  transformation.  The  training  must  be  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  current  and \nfuture labor market, and to the demands of emerging industries. The quality of trainers is critical \nfor effective training. A newly issued policy in 2015 (i) improves the quality of training institutions, \ntrainers,  and  training  programs  for  workers  to  be  redeployed  and  reemployed;  and  (ii) \nstrengthens the foundation of human resource development in Hebei. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n24. \nHebei is having difficulty mobilizing the financing to implement the HCAAP. The budget \nfor its implementation is estimated at CNY176.3 billion, of which CNY79.4 billion ($12.4 billion) \nis for direct measures to control air pollution during 2013\u20132017. The required funds equal 78% \nof Hebei\u2019s annual fiscal revenue and are nine times more than Hebei\u2019s regular fiscal expenditure \non  environmental  protection  in  2014.  In  2013\u20132014,  a  total  of  CNY19.1  billion  was  made \navailable, but the central, provincial, and municipal governments are required to scale up their \nfinancial contributions. Out of the $12.4 billion, $4.8 billion is expected to be spent during 2015\u2013\n2016  (Table  1).  The  actual  financial  inputs  by  the  governments  during  2013\u20132014  and \nestimated  fund  allocations  during  2015\u20132017  will  amount  to  about  $9.2  billion,  leaving  a \nfinancing  gap  of  about  $3.2  billion.  The  ADB,  KfW,  and  World  Bank  financial  assistance  will \nincrease  the  total  available  resources  to  $10.2  billion,  covering  more  than  80%  of  the  $12.4 \nbillion, with an additional $2.2 billion to be mobilized for 2017 expenditure. The estimated cost of \nthe agreed policy actions is $1.1 billion during 2015\u20132016, approximately 2.4 times more than \nthe  ADB\u2013KfW  PBL  loan  proceeds.  A  larger  investment  is  expected  in  2017,  the  final  year  of \nHCAAP.17 \n \n\nTable 1: HCAAP Program Expenditure (2013\u20132017) \n\nExpenditure Categories for Direct Air Pollution Control \nIndustrial pollution control \nUrban dust and agriculture point and area source pollution control \nVehicle and mobile source pollution prevention and control \nUpgrade or phase out of coal-fired boilers and switch to cleaner energy sources \nFuel switch from coal to natural gas and other cleaner energy sources \nAir quality and pollution monitoring, capacity building, and training \n \n\nTotal \n\n2013\u20132017  \nEstimated \nHCAAP Cost  \n($ million) \n1,388.9  \n4,676.1  \n2,221.9  \n879.5  \n2,933.0  \n330.8  \n12,430.2  \n\n2015\u20132016 \nEstimated \nExpenditure \n($ million) \n434.5  \n1,841.9  \n845.0  \n305.1  \n1,290.4  \n81.3  \n4,798.2  \n\nHCAAP = Hebei Clean Air Action Plan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe Government of the PRC has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n25. \ncapital resources and a promotional loan of \u20ac150 million equivalent in US dollar from KfW. The \nADB  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  annuity  repayment \nmethod based on a 15% discount factor; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  and  a  commitment  charge  of \n\n                                                \n17  Justification of Policy-Based Loan Amount (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n0.15% per year.

The  agreed  policy  actions  would  contribute  to  reducing  Hebei\u2019s \nannual coal consumption by approximately 12.4 million tons of standard coal, representing 4% \nof  Hebei\u2019s  total  consumption  of  287  million  tons  in  2012.19 Estimated  annual  reductions  of  air \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions against 2012 baselines will be 18 million tons of carbon \ndioxide,  170,000  tons  of  primary  PM2.5  (19%  reduction),  546,000 tons  of  sulfur  dioxide  (33%), \n289,000 tons of nitrogen oxide (14%), and 71,000 tons of VOCs (5%).20 Policy actions focusing \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n19 The  figures  for  reductions  in  standard  coal  consumption  and  air  emissions  are  based  on  the  best  available \ninformation  with  assumptions.  The  unit  for  standard  coal\u2014ton  coal  equivalent\u2014represents  the  energy  generated \nby burning 1 ton of standard coal, i.e., 29.4 gigajoules or 8.1 megawatt-hours. \n\n20 A measure of Hebei\u2019s GHG emission in 2012 is not available. The reduction of annual coal consumption is equal to \n2% of total coal production in the United States in 2012; the PM2.5 emission reduction is twice the total emission of \nthe United Kingdom; the carbon dioxide emission reduction is equal to Mongolia\u2019s national emission. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\non  upgrading  air  quality  monitoring  systems  may  further  reduce  emissions  by  improving \nregulatory enforcement and environmental supervision, but their actual contribution is difficult to \nquantify and thus not included in the estimates. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nAir pollution is the largest contributor to the burden of disease from the environment. The \nprogram  will  significantly  cut  pollution  emissions  in  the  BTH  region.  Its  economic  benefits \ninclude  (i)  reduced  public  health-related  costs  due  to  avoided  mortality  and  morbidity,  \n(ii) improved economic activities due to increased labor productivity, (iii) avoided ecosystem and \nbiodiversity losses, and (iv) reduced maintenance cost of buildings and other infrastructure. The \nestimation  of  economic  benefits  from  the  program  is  difficult  due  to  several  complex \nassumptions  involved  with  the  analysis,  including  (i)  emission  reductions  due  to  the  program \nand translation of the reduced pollutions to outdoor air quality in Hebei and the BTH region, and  \n(ii)  identification  of  the  number  and  geographical  distribution  of  affected  people  and  extent  of \ntheir  exposure  to  the  improved  air  quality.  However,  the  economic  benefit  of  the  program  is \njustified  by  the  evidence  that  in  2010  PRC  outdoor  air  pollution  was  estimated  to  cause  \n1.3 million premature deaths and economic losses of 9.7%\u201313.2% of national GDP.21 \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  country  assessment  concludes  that  the  PRC  has  strong  financial  management \nlegislation,  structures,  and  systems  in  place,  which  have  been  reinforced  in  recent  years  and \naligned with international standards. For Hebei, the assessment demonstrates that the Finance \nDepartment  has  good  capacity  based  on  the  well-established  and  operating  financial \nmanagement  system. 22 Risks  of  public  financial  management  in  the  PRC  and  the  program \nremain moderate as subprovincial performance lags the implementation of reforms in some core \nfunctional  areas  of  accounting,  reporting,  internal  audit,  and  internal  control.  The  country \nassessment  concludes  that  regulatory  frameworks  have  been  significantly  enhanced  in  the \nareas  of  procurement  and  anticorruption  in  the  PRC.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and HPG. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nBetter air quality will benefit the whole population of the BTH region, particularly children \nand  the  elderly,  who  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  diseases. 23 \nUnder  the  program,  the  phaseout  of  small  coal-fired  boilers  in  urban  and  rural  areas  may \nnegatively  affect  the  facilities\u2019  current  employees.  The  agreed  policy  reform  under  the  social \nsector  will  provide  improved  employment  support  and  social  protection  for  these  workers,  as \nwell  as  those  who  may  be  affected  by  activities  not  related  to  the  program  during  HCAAP \nimplementation  (e.g.,  industrial  production  capacity  adjustment).  In  the  long-term,  the  agreed \npolicy  reforms  are  expected  to  bring  several  potential  indirect  benefits,  including  (i)  better \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n21 In 2010, the PRC\u2019s GDP was CNY40.2 trillion ($6.1 trillion). The estimated cost of the PRC\u2019s outdoor air pollution \nincrease  is  due to accumulated  evidence  and  improved  analytical  techniques:  $76  billion in  2003  (3.8%  of  GDP, \ncurrent price) by the World Bank; $145 billion in 2005 (5.9% of GDP) by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; \nand  $635  billion  in  2010  (9.7%\u201313.2%  of  GDP)  by  the  Global  Commission  on  the  Economy  and  Climate.

The  policy  reform \nincludes  designing  an  appropriate  and  affordable  heating  tariff  structure  for  clean  energy \nheating service for poor households. The policy reform for appropriate incentive mechanisms to \npromote  clean  energy  utilization  in  rural  areas  will  also  ensure  it  is  affordable  for  rural \nhouseholds, as this is a key aspect in promoting cleaner energy in rural areas. \n \nE. \n \nDue  diligence  during  preparation  concluded  that  the  program's  policy  actions  do  not \n31. \nentail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  or  the \nenvironment.24 The program is categorized C for  involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, \nand environment. \n \nF. \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan. 25  The  program  is  categorized  as  medium  risk  mainly  due  to  weak \nsubprovincial performance of the public financial management and slow fund disbursement. The \nmitigation  measures  were  agreed  to  closely  monitor  fund  allocation  and  outputs  of  clean  air \nactions.
