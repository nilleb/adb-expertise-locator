Weak\ngovernance  has  resulted  in  inefficient  utility  operations,  power\ntheft,  illegal  power  supply,  reduced  billing  and  collection,  and\nnonpayment of arrears. These problems have had an adverse\nimpact  on  the  financial  performance  of  the  utilities  and  have\nhindered  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  power\nsector.    This  situation  has  affected  the  poor  segment  of  the\npopulation  more  than  the  affluent  and  contributed  to  the  build\nup  of  the  financial  crisis  in  the  sector,  which  has  negatively\naffected \nframework.\nAppropriate  reforms  and  necessary  adjustment  measures,\nincluding introduction of a market-driven system, are needed to\nrestore  financial  and  operational  viability  in  the  sector  and  to\nmake \nit  self-sustaining.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nsupport of the Government\u2019s initiatives for structural reforms in\nthe energy sector is considered essential given the urgent need\nto  introduce  competition  as  the  driving  force  for  improvements\nand  private  sector  participation  as  a  vehicle  for  creating  a\ncompetitive environment. Ensuring a stable supply of electricity\nis  essential  for  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  recovery  and  thus  job\ncreation for the poor. The Program provides a sound basis for\nthe  Government  to  reform  and  restructure  the  energy  sector.\nThe  development  of  a  competitive  energy  market  under  the\nreform  Program  will  result  in  efficiency  gains  that  will  have  a\npositive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  The  ESRP  is  an  integral\nelement  of \nthe\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in Pakistan.\n\nthe  structural  adjustment  program  of \n\nThe  long-term  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  intervention  is  to  ensure  a  self-\nsustaining,  efficient,  and  competitive  energy  sector  that  can\nprovide the required quantity and quality of energy supply at the\nleast  cost  to  consumers.  The  competitive  industry  structure\nmust  be  enhanced  and  market  regulation  strengthened  to\nensure  investor  confidence  and  consumer  protection.  The\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n\fiii\n\nProgram identifies the following areas of reforms necessary to\nachieve  its  objectives:  (i)  enhancement  of  governance  in  the\nsector, (ii) enhancement of the legal and regulatory  framework\nand  strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  the  sector  regulator,  (iii)\nfinancial  restructuring  and  privatization  of  Karachi  Electric\nSupply  Corporation  (KESC),  (iv)  restructuring  of  Water  and\nPower  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  and  privatization  of\ncorporatized  entities,  (v)  creation  of  an  enabling  environment\nfor  a  competitive  electricity  market,  (vi)  resolution  of  the  IPP\nissue  and  finalization  of  the  Hub  River  Power  Plant  Company\n(HUBCO)  and  the  Kot  Addu  Power  Plant  Company  (KAPCO)\ncases, and (vii) enhancement of reform in the natural gas and\npetroleum  subsector.  The  reform  program  will  be  jointly\nsupported  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  IMF,  with  the  World\nBank (WB) providing parallel financing.\n\nCategory C: Environmental implications were reviewed and no\nsignificant adverse impacts were identified.\n\nresources \n\n(i) A program loan of $300 million will be provided, from ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital \nto  be\ndetermined in accordance with the pool-based variable lending\nrate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  with  a  term  of  15  years,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and\nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.\n\n(OCR),  with \n\ninterest \n\nloan \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\n(ii)  A  program \nto\nSDR39,083,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  for  a\nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with\ninterest of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period, and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nloan, \n\nin  various  currencies,  equivalent \n\n(iii)  A  TA \nto\nSDR3,908,000  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  of  the  ADB\nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and\nwith an interest rate of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nThe  Program  period  will  be  January  2000  to  December  2003.\nThe  Government  will  be  able  to  withdraw  funds  from  the  loan\naccount up to 31 December 2003 (a period of three years from\nloan  effectiveness).  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  three\ntranches.  The  first  tranche,  equivalent  to  $150  million,  will  be\nmade available on loan effectiveness, of which, $100 million will\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEnvironment\n\nAssessment\n\nThe Loans\n\nAmounts and Terms\n\nProgram Period\n\nand Tranching\n\n\fiv\n\nbe  from  OCR,  and  SDR39,083,000  from  Special  Funds\nresources.  An  incentive  tranche  of  $50  million,  from  OCR,  will\nbe  made  available  after  three  months  and  upon  satisfactory\ncompliance with the stipulated conditions. The second and third\ntranches,  each  amounting  to  $75  million,  will  be  released  in\nDecember  2001  and  December  2002.  Specific  conditionalities\nare  set  for  the  release  of  the  second  and  third  tranches;\nhowever,  if  all  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  are  met,\nexcept  the  privatization  of  the  two  WAPDA  entities  (one\ndistribution company and one generation company), and if the\nthird  tranche  condition  in  respect  of  the  privatization  of  KESC\nhas  been  met,  then  the  two  privatization  conditions  will  be\ntransposed,  and  all  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  second\ntranche will be considered to be met.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.\nMOF  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the\nESRP, and administer the utilization of the loan proceeds. MOF\nwill be supported by (i) the Ministry of Water and Power in the\nimplementation  of  the  sector  reforms,  (ii)  the  National  Electric\nPower  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  to  ensure  proper  sector\nregulation, and (iii) the Privatization Commission to support the\nprivatization  of  KESC  and  other  corporatized  WAPDA  entities.\nA federal steering committee and a KESC privatization cell will\nensure the timely implementation of the reform Program.\n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full\nforeign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of\ngoods  and  services  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\nmember countries (other than items specified in the prohibited\nlist  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral\nsources).\n\nThe counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the\nprogram loan will be used to finance the adjustment costs such\nas  financial  relief  to  the  utilities  and  certain  programs  and\nactivities consistent with the ESRP.\n\nThe TA loan for capacity enhancement in the energy sector will\nbe  used  to  undertake  (i)  a  poverty  impact  assessment  to\nmonitor  and  evaluate  impacts  on  residential  and  commercial\nconsumers,  with  special  attention  to  the  poorest  segment  of\nconsumers;  and  (ii)  a  labor  impact  assessment  and  mitigation\nmeasures  to  reduce  vulnerability  of  redundant  workers.    A\nportion  of  the  TA  funds  may  be  used  to  prepare  a  plan  to\nreduce  vulnerability  of  redundant  workers  in  consultation  with\nall stakeholders.\n\nExecuting Agency\nImplementation\n\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nTA Loan\n\n\fSafeguards and Risks\n\nv\n\nKESC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA  loan,  and  will\nprovide  the  necessary  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  local\ntransportation, and other services to the consultants.\n\nAll  procurement  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  consultants  will  be\nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to\nthe ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nThe  most  important  safeguard  is  that  the  reform  Program  is\ncomprehensive  and  was  formulated  by  the  Government.  The\nplans  for  its  implementation  have  been  worked  out  by  the\nto  political  realities  and\nGovernment  with  due  attention \nimplementation capacity. A second factor is the sequencing of\nactions that are already in place, including the establishment of\nNEPRA,  an  independent  sector  regulator;  enactment  of  the\nprivatization law, which protects the rights of the investors and\nconsumers;  announcement  of  the  draft  labor  policy;  resolution\nof  the  IPP  issue  and  the  finalization  of  the  HUBCO  case;\namendment of the WAPDA Act to split WAPDA for privatization;\nderegulation  of  furnace  oil  prices;  adjustment  of  fuel  prices\nlinked to the international price fluctuations; and privatization of\nliquefied  petroleum  gas  operations.  A  third  mitigating  factor  is\nthe ADB\u2019s close monitoring of the implementation of the reform\nProgram,  with  the  World  Bank  and  IMF.  Finally,  adequate\nprovisions  have  been  made  to  mitigate  risks  relating  to  social\naspects.  Since \nreform  program  challenges  existing\neconomic interests, a major risk is weakened political resolve to\nimplement the Program at the required pace and sequencing of\nmacroeconomic  and  energy  sector  structural  reforms.  Political\ncommitment  to  reforms  could  waiver  in  the  face  of  strong\nopposition from interested groups. Another risk is that of social\ndiscontent  arising  from  the  difficult  economic  situation  and\nadjustment measures needed to weed out corruption and theft\nin the power sector. The economic and the political costs of the\n\u201cno-reform\u201d  scenario  in  the  energy  sector  are  grave  and  the\nresulting  consequences  are  unacceptable  to  the  Government.\nWhile the risks involved in supporting a strong reform program\nin the energy sector are significant, they are less than the risks\nof not supporting such a program.\n\nthe \n\n\fI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  for  the  proposed\nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Energy Sector Restructuring Program (ESRP)\ncomprising  (i)  two  program  loans,  one  for  $300  million  and  the  other  for  SDR39,083,000  to\nsupport  policy  reforms  under  the  ESRP,  and  (ii)  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  of\nSDR3,908,000 for capacity enhancement in the energy sector.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn  April  1998,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) to provide a quick-disbursing policy-based loan facility to rectify the financial crisis in the\npower sector and meet part of the sector shortfalls and restructuring costs. In response, an ADB\nmission visited Pakistan during March-April 1998 to identify key issues, and to discuss with the\nGovernment  the  possible  ADB  assistance  and  develop  the  objective  and  scope  of  the  ESRP.\nThe mission advised the Government that the further processing of the ESRP would depend on\nthe  Government\u2019s  implementation  of  policy  reforms;  formulation  of  a  realistic,  credible,  and\nfeasible  financial  package  for  the  restructuring  of  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority\n(WAPDA)  and  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC);  unbundling,  restructuring  as\ncorporations  (corporatization),  and  commercialization  of  unbundled  WAPDA  entities;  steps\nleading  to  the  privatization  of  KESC  and  the  corporatized  WAPDA  entities;  operational\nindependence  of  the  sector  regulator;  electricity  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  including  a\nreduction  in  cross-subsidies;  and  resolution  of  the  issue  of  the  independent  power  producers\n(IPPs).\n\n3.\nA  fact-finding  mission  visited  Pakistan  from  21  April  to  6  May  1998  to  firm  up\nunderstanding  of  the  program  loan.    However,  the  processing  of  the  ESRP  was  suspended\nfollowing the nuclear testing in May 1998, the subsequent bilateral sanctions, and suspension of\nassistance  from  international  financial  institutions.    Nonetheless,  ADB  effectively  made  use  of\nthis  period  by  fielding  a  number  of  follow-up  missions  to  continue  policy  dialogue  with  the\nGovernment to resolve all pending issues and sought agreement on time-bound implementation\nof  the  reform  measures.  Since  the  ESRP  is  an  integral  element  of  the  structural  adjustment\nprogram  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  its  processing  recommenced  after  the\nresumption  of  Enhanced  Structural  Adjustment  Facility  (ESAF)/Extended  Fund  Facility  (EFF)\nprogram  in  January  1999.  The  Appraisal  Mission1  visited  Pakistan  from  26  July  to  17  August\n2000  to  finalize  the  agreement  with  the  Government.    The  final  agreements  reached  are\nreflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  Policy  Matrix\n(Appendix 1).  The program framework is provided in Appendix 2.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans\n\n4.\nSince taking power in October 1999, the new Government has accelerated the pace of\neconomic  reforms.  A  comprehensive  structural  reform  program  in  line  with  the  economic\n\n                                                \n1  The  Mission  comprised  Sadiq  H.  Zaidi,  Senior  Project  Engineer/Mission  Leader;  Rune  Stroem,  Senior  Financial\nSpecialist; Rita O\u2019Sullivan, Counsel; S.B. Koh, Economist; Tomoyuki Kimura, Energy Sector Specialist; and Carol\nLitwin,  Poverty  Specialist.    K.  Rahman,  Manager,  and  M.  Zijsvelt,  Resident  Representative,  Pakistan  Resident\nMission, provided support to the Mission and attended key meetings with the Government of Pakistan.\n\n\f2\n\nroadmap  was  announced  by  the  new  Government  in  December  1999,  and  a  broad-based\npoverty reduction strategy is being prepared.\n\n5.\nThe  Government\u2019s  formulation  of  a  poverty  reduction  strategy  takes  into  account  the\ninterrelation of economic, social, and governance dimensions. A four-track approach has been\nidentified by the Government: (i) broadly based economic growth that provides efficient income\ngenerating opportunities for the poor and a pattern of growth that is relatively labor intensive; (ii)\nachievement  of  the  highest  possible  growth  path  that  is  consistent  with  the  available  financial\nand  human  capital  under  a  governance  architecture  that  is  both  humane  and  efficient;  (iii)\nimproved  access  to  education,  skills  training,  primary  health  care,  nutrition,  and  other  social\nservices  that  help  the  poor  become  productive  employees  or  capable  of  starting  small-scale\nbusiness ventures; and (iv) provision of safety nets for the vulnerable groups.\n\n6.\nThe main focus of the Government\u2019s fiscal reforms is to improve revenue performance\nthrough  broadening  the  tax  base  and  strengthening  tax  administration.  In  the  recent  past,  the\nGovernment has introduced a number of tax measures, including (i) an on-the-spot assessment\nscheme  in  13  cities  to  increase  tax  compliance,  registration,  and  documentation;  (ii)  periodic\nadjustments of petroleum prices in line with international price developments and elimination of\nthe subsidy on furnace oil; (iii) increased registration under the goods and services tax (GST),\nwhich will be extended to cover the services sector; and (iv) reorganization and downsizing of\nthe Central Board of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  A  number  of  additional  fiscal\ninitiatives  are  also  under  consideration,  including  an  agricultural  income  tax,  and  a  more\nintegrated, client-based, and functional tax administration system will be introduced.\n\nIn the financial sector, detailed privatization plans have been drafted and disposal of the\n7.\nremaining  shares  of  national  commercial  banks  and  other  state-owned  financial  institutions  is\nproceeding.  New  managers  from  the  private  sector  have  been  appointed  in  all  but  one  of  the\ndevelopment  financial  institutes.  A  program  has  also  been  designed  to  enhance  the  minimum\ncapital requirements together with necessary amendments in banking laws for this purpose.  In\naddition, the State Bank of Pakistan will be restructured to focus on its core operations such as\nmonetary  policy,  banking  supervision  and  foreign  exchange  management.  The  new  insurance\nlaw passed in June 2000 will increase financial soundness and help further growth in the sector.\nUnder  assistance  mainly  from  ADB,2  the  Government  has  introduced  major  capital  market\nchanges, including establishing a national clearing and settlement system, automating of stock\nexchange transactions, and setting up credit rating agencies to strengthen information flows and\nmarket efficiency.\n\n8.\nPrivatization, which is urgently required to prevent further losses, has been accelerated\nrecently.  Initial  measures  have  included  (i)  a  privatization  law  (to  enhance  transparency,\naccountability,  and  efficiency  in  the  privatization  process)  has  been  approved;  (ii)  two  national\ncommercial banks and a partially privatized bank will soon be listed on the stock exchange; (iii)\nbidding  for  the  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  business  of  three  companies  and  the  meter\nmanufacturing unit of a gas company is to be held by the end of 2000; and (iv) in the industrial\nsector,  six  units  are  to  be  liquidated  or  sold  through  the  stock  market  before  the  end  of  June\n2001 and a large number of state-owned enterprise will be privatized in the next two years. The\nproposed  ESRP  loan  will  support  privatization  of  KESC  and  two  corporatized  entities  of\nWAPDA.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Loan  1576,  the  National  Investment  Trust  and  Mutual  Funds  of\nInvestment Corporation of Pakistan are to be privatized by the end of 2000.\n\n                                                \n2  Loan 1576-PAK: Capital Markets Development Program Loan, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.\n\n\f3\n\nB. \n\nRecent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects\n\n1. \n\nRecent Macroeconomic Performance\n\nThe  past  two  years  have  been  difficult  for  Pakistan\u2019s  economy.    Following  the  nuclear\n9.\ntests in late May 1998, economic sanctions magnified Pakistan\u2019s long standing socioeconomic\ndifficulties. IMF also suspended its ESAF-EFF package. The economy declined sharply due to\nthe  erosion  of  investor  confidence,  the  virtual  cessation  of  private  capital  inflows,  and  the\nsuspension  of  new  official  development  assistance.  Consequently,  Pakistan  faced  a  severe\nforeign exchange crisis as reserves fell to $415 million or the equivalent of less than two weeks\nof  imports  in  November  1998.  To  prevent  the  total  collapse  of  the  balance  of  payments,  the\nGovernment adopted short-term measures including freezing foreign currency accounts held in\ndomestic  banks,  adopting  a  dual  exchange  rate  system,  and  delaying  the  servicing  of  foreign\ndebt.\n\n10.\nIMF  revived  the  ESAF-EFF  in  January  1999  after  the  partial  waiving  of  sanctions  in\nDecember  1998.  Multilateral  funding  resumed  at  the  same  time.  In  late  January  1999,  the\nGovernment and bilateral creditors negotiated an agreement to reschedule official debt. In early\nJuly 1999, Pakistan concluded an agreement for rescheduling commercial loans valued at $877\nmillion.   In late September 2000, IMF and the Government reached a preliminary agreement for\na  standby  program,  which  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  IMF  Board  in  November  2000.\nInitially, the program will be for one year.  But the agreement could be subsumed into a Poverty\nReduction Growth Facility (PRGF) by mid-2001.  In addition, Pakistan would be accorded a one-\nyear  debt  rescheduling,  since  the  present  debt  rescheduling  agreements  will  expire  on  31\nDecember 2000.\n\n11.\nPakistan\u2019s economic performance during FY2000 showed some improvement. The new\nGovernment introduced a number of measures to stabilize the economy. Positive signs included\na modest recovery in economic growth, a fall in inflation rate, increased exports, and a relatively\nstable foreign exchange level.\n\n12.\nReal GDP grew by 4.8 percent in FY2000 as against 3.1 percent of the previous year.\nOne  of  the main reasons for  this recovery was a significant improvement in agriculture, which\ngrew by 7.2 percent. A sharp recovery in bumper cotton and wheat crops and a good rice crop\nsupported  high  agriculture  sector  growth.  The  performance  of  manufacturing  in  general  and\nlarge-scale  manufacturing  in  particular  appeared  weak,  as  they  grew  by  only  1.1  percent  and\n-0.7  percent,  respectively.  This  weak  performance  was  mainly  due  to  a  decline  in  sugar\nproduction. The service sector grew by 4.5 percent during the period. The increase rate of the\nconsumer price index (CPI) declined to 3.6 percent during FY2000 as against 5.7 percent of the\nprevious year.\n\n13.\nAlongside these positive developments are several areas of concern that require serious\nGovernment  attention  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  First,  fiscal  deficit  emerged  as  a  major\nsource of macroeconomic imbalance. Although Pakistan succeeded in reducing its fiscal deficit\nfrom 7.7 percent of GDP in FY1998 to 6.5 percent in FY2000, the current size of the deficit itself\nis  unsustainable.  Future  fiscal  adjustment  is  essential  for  restoring  macroeconomic  stability.\nSecond, continued weaknesses in the tax revenue effort and substantial debt service payments\nconstrain  policy  choices,  particularly  by  limiting  much  needed  outlays  for  infrastructure  and\nsocial  sectors.  In  this  context,  the  main  focus  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  reform  is  to  improve\nrevenue  performance  through  broadening  the  tax  base  and  strengthening  tax  administration.\nAccording to the federal budget for FY2001 approved in June 2000, the fiscal deficit is projected\n\n\f4\n\nto decline to 4.5 percent in the current year, but it was subsequently revised to 5.0 percent after\ndiscussion with IMF.\n\n14.\nThe fragile balance-of-payments situation remains one of the principal areas of concern.\nThe trade deficit reached $1.7 billion, doubled the Government\u2019s $800 million target for FY2000.\nAlthough  exports  expanded  by  8.7  percent  during  the  year,  imports  increased  by  8.0  percent,\ndue largely to higher prices of petroleum and related products. The widened trade gap, coupled\nwith a negative resource transfer from funding agencies, have exerted pressure on the balance\nof  payments.  Foreign  exchange  reserves  as  of  June  2000  totaled  $1.39  billion,  which  is  less\nthan two months of imports.\n\n15.\nAnother  area  that  requires  immediate  attention  is  arresting  the  increasing  poverty.\nDeclining  economic  growth,  severe  macroeconomic  imbalances,  lack  of  social  safety  net,  and\npoor  governance  in  the  1990s  have  had  adverse  effects  on  the  country\u2019s  poor  and  most\nvulnerable. The incidence of calorie-based poverty has increased from 17.3 percent in FY1988\nto 22.4 percent in FY1993 and further to 35.2 percent in FY1999.3\n\n16.\nThe  short-to-medium-term  prospects  for  the  Pakistan  economy  will  depend  on  political\nstability  and  the  pace  of  economic  reforms.  Above  all,  improving  the  quality  of  governance  is\nessential for the success of reforms and a sustainable development program. Assuming that the\nGovernment  will  implement  major  structural  reforms  in  a  timely  manner  and  maintain\nmacroeconomic stability, GDP is projected to grow by 5.0 percent in FY2001. The inflation rate\nis expected to be around 4.5 percent on the assumption that monetary expansion will be around\n9.0  percent.  The  trade  sector  is  expected  to  improve  in  FY2001,  with  11.0  percent  growth  in\nexports  and  3.6  percent  increase  in  imports  owing  to  sustained  increase  in  agriculture\nproduction, revival of manufacturing sector, and stable prices of oil and its products. The trade\naccount  is  projected  to  be  in  deficit  by  $1.3  billion  in  FY2001,  and  thus  the  current  account\ndeficit is expected to decline to 2.0 percent of GDP in FY2001 from 2.4 percent in FY2000.\n\n2. \n\nImpact of Energy Sector Restructuring on the Economy\n\n17.\nThe  electricity  and  gas  sector  accounts  for  over  4.0  percent  of  GDP.    It  is  the  third\nlargest  commodity  sector  in  the  economy  following  agriculture  and  manufacturing.  In  FY2000\nthe energy sector grew by 7.8 percent, substantially higher than the overall GDP growth rate of\n4.8 percent. Given the importance of the energy sector, the restructuring program is expected to\nhave  a  significant  impact  on  economic  growth  through  a  reduction  of  the  budget  deficit,  a\nreduction of the current account deficit, increased efficiency in the energy sector, and improved\noverall resource allocation in the economy.\n\n18.\nThe  restructuring  program  is  expected  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the  energy  sector\nthrough  the  introduction  of  competitive  market  forces  and  the  subsequent  reduction  in\ntransmission and distribution losses. This will help reduce production costs across all industries,\nincluding agriculture and manufacturing, in the medium to long term, which will contribute to a\nlower  inflation  rate  and  higher  economic  growth.  Reduction  in  transmission  and  distribution\nlosses will also reduce corruption and waste of public resources.\n\n19.\nThe effect of the restructuring program on the overall resource allocation in the economy\nis also expected to be significant. Allocation of Government funds to the energy sector diverts\npublic  funds  away  from  social  sectors  and  activities  which  are  more  conducive  for  poverty\n\n                                                \n3 Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the Government of Pakistan, September 2000.\n\n\f5\n\nreduction and fostering economic growth. For instance, the operating loss in FY2000 of KESC\nalone was PRs12.9 billion, i.e., over 70.0 percent of the total Government expenditure on social\nservices, 144.0 percent of the expenditure on education and 250.0 percent of the expenditure\non health. Although these funds are not fully fungible, it is evident that continuous allocation of\npublic  resources  to  the  energy  sector  crowds  out  public  investments  to  other  sectors  of  the\neconomy. Thus restructuring of the energy sector will lead to a more efficient allocation of public\nfunds, which will contribute to enhancing sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\nThe  inefficiencies  in  the  energy  sector  are  imposing  an  increasing  burden  on  the\n20.\nGovernment budget. Given the unsustainable fiscal deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in FY2000, the\nGovernment does not have the resources to continuously inject funds into the energy sector. In\nFY2000,  KESC  had  net  loss  of  PRs12.9  billion,  and    net  liabilities  PRs20.4  billion.  Although\nWAPDA did not have net loss, in FY2000 the Government was forced to convert PRs36.3 billion\nof  debt  into  equity  and  WAPDA  had  contingent  liabilities  to  HUBCO  and  KAPCO  of  PRs31\nbillion. An idea of the size of these liabilities and losses can be had from the fact that the total\ntax  revenue  in  FY2000  was  PRs346  billion,  and  the  development  expenditure  was  only\nPRs100.6  billion.  The  Government  is  committed  to  reducing  its  fiscal  deficit  to  5.0  percent  of\nGDP  in  FY2001,  and  3.5  percent  of  the  GDP  by  FY2003.  The  restructuring  program,  by\nreducing losses and facilitating privatization of KESC, will play a critical role in the achievement\nof these targets.\n\n21.\nThe  energy  sector  is  highly  import  intensive  in  its  input  usage,  particularly  petroleum\nproducts.  In  FY2000,  petroleum  products  and  crude  oil  imports  amounted  to  $2.8  billion,  i.e.,\n27.2  percent  of  the  Pakistan\u2019s  total  imports.  If  the  transmission  and  distribution  losses  of\nWAPDA and KESC were reduced by 50.0 percent, Pakistan would have needed to import 13.0\npercent  less  of  petroleum  products  at  a  saving  of  over  $350  million.  The  energy  sector\nrestructuring  program,  besides  helping  to  reduce  the  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  will\nalso  support  the  replacement  of  imported  petroleum  products  with  domestically  produced\nnatural gas. The substitution is projected to generate $3.0 billion in foreign exchange savings for\nthe government over the next 10 years, or $300 million a year. Thus the combined impact of the\nrestructuring program in reducing the current account deficit would be significant.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE ENERGY SECTOR\n\nA.\n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nPower Subsector\n\n22.\nPakistan  has  two  public  sector  power  utilities:  KESC,  a  predominantly  Government-\ncontrolled  public  limited  liability  company,  and  WAPDA,  a  Government-owned  statutory  body.\nThe  installed  generation  capacity  of  Pakistan\u2019s  public  sector  power  system  is  about  11,890\nmegawatts (MW) of which WAPDA\u2019s capacity is 9,950 MW (84.0 percent), KESC\u2019s at 1,800 MW\n(15.0  percent),  and  Karachi  Nuclear  Power  Plant  at  140  MW  (1.0  percent).  Of  WAPDA\u2019s  total\ncapacity of 9,950 MW, about 4,825 MW is from hydropower and 5,125 MW from thermal power.\nKESC\u2019s  generation  capacity  is  entirely  thermal.  Thus,  of  Pakistan\u2019s  total  generation  capacity,\nabout 58.0 percent is thermal, 41.0 percent hydropower, and 1.0 percent nuclear.\n\n23.\nKESC was established in 1913 as a private corporation under the Indian Companies Act\nof  1882.  The  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MWP)  now  controls  its\nmanagement.  Presently,  KESC  is  majority  owned  by  the  Government,  which  holds  a  93.0\npercent equity stake, controlled directly and indirectly through public sector organizations. The\n\n\f6\n\nremaining  7.0  percent  of  shares  are  privately  held.  KESC  ranks  among  the  top  15  Pakistani\ncompanies in terms of market capitalization and is listed on the Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore\nstock exchanges. KESC is a vertically integrated electric utility and supplies power to Karachi,\nPakistan\u2019s largest city and the country\u2019s commercial and financial capital. KESC\u2019s transmission\nand  distribution  lines  span  over  15,500  kilometers  (km).  Its  extensive  and  relatively  affluent\nfranchise area caters to 1.7 million customers and covers an estimated 6,000 square kilometer\n(km2),  including  nearby  industrial  areas  in  Sindh  and  Balochistan  provinces.  Of  KESC\u2019s  total\ninstalled  capacity,  its  available  capacity  has  recently  been  as  low  as  900  MW  due  to\nobsolescence of some of the plants and lack of reserve capacity to enable the units to be taken\nout  of  service  for  maintenance.  However,  since  the  last  unit  was  installed  in  1997,  and  with\nKESC  now  having  access  to  capacity  from  two  recently  completed  independent  power\nproducers (IPPs), the backlog of maintenance has been tackled and the available capacity now\namounts  to  about  1,400  MW.    This  meets  less  than  70.0  percent  of  the  energy  demand.  The\nbalance  is  met  by  purchasing  electricity  from  WAPDA  and  small  generation  plants  of  other\nindustrial complexes in Karachi.\n\n24. WAPDA  was  created  by  an  Act  in  1958,  as  an  autonomous  body  for  the  development\nand  use  of  the  water  and  power  resources  of  the  then  West  Pakistan  on  a  unified  and\nmultipurpose  basis.  WAPDA\u2019s  responsibility  covered  the  development  and  use  of  water\nresources and included activities related to irrigation, water supply and drainage, flood control,\nprevention  of  water  logging,  and  salinity  control.  WAPDA\u2019s  Power  Wing  functions  as  an\nintegrated  electric  power  utility  for  the  entire  country,  except  Metropolitan  Karachi,  which  is\nserviced  by  KESC.  WAPDA  has  about  110,000  employees,  most  of  whom  work  in  the  Power\nWing. WAPDA has 11 thermal power generation stations with a total capacity of 5,125 MW. The\nhydropower  projects,  such  as  Ghazi  Barotha  (under  construction),  Mangla,  and  Tarbela  are\nmanaged by the Water Wing, since they are primarily operated to meet irrigation demands, with\nelectricity  as  a  secondary  output.  WAPDA\u2019s  installed  hydropower  capacity  of  4,825  MW\nrepresented 41.0 percent of its current total generation capacity. The power distribution function\nof  WAPDA  is  carried  out  by  eight  area  electricity  boards,  namely:  Faisalabad,  Gujranwala,\nHyderabad,  Islamabad,  Lahore,  Multan,  Peshawar,  and  Quetta.  At  present,  the  lines  for  the\ntransmission  of  power  and  the  grid  system  for  the  entire  country  are  owned,  managed,  and\noperated  by  WAPDA  through  its  transmission  and  grid  department.  WAPDA  provides  electric\npower utility service to about 11.6 million customers.\n\n25.\nAdditional  Generation  Capacity.  Power  consumption  in  Pakistan  grew  rapidly  during\nthe  1970s  and  1980s,  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  over  9.0  percent,  although  it  slowed\nsomewhat over the past 3-4 years as Pakistan has encountered economic difficulties. The most\nsignificant  increase  was  in  the  domestic  sector,  the  share  of  which  tripled  during  that  period.\nWhile  the  growth  in  electricity  consumption  has  been  strong,  Pakistan\u2019s  per  capita  electricity\nconsumption  per  year  remains  low  at  320  kilowatt-hours  (kWh),  less  than  one  quarter  of  the\naverage for the region as a whole. Also, close to half of the population remains without access\nto  electricity  services.  An  overview  of  key  sector  indicators  is  presented  in  Supplementary\nAppendix  A.  Since  the  1980s,  power  supply  lagged  behind  demand,  resulting  in  major  load\nshedding of up to 30 percent of peak demand. In the early 1990s, it was clear that, with demand\ngrowing  at  about  9.0  percent  per  year,  WAPDA  and  KESC  did  not  have  the  resources  to\nincrease  generation  capacity  at  the  rate  required  to  eliminate  load  shedding  and  undertake\nessential  routine  maintenance  on  all  plants  in  the  system.  Faced  with  the  chronic  power\nshortages, the Government in 1994 initiated a study of Pakistan\u2019s future energy needs up to the\nyear  2020.  The  report  highlighted  that  additional  generation  capacity  of  about  9,800  MW  was\nurgently  needed  by  the  year  2002.  Of  this  recommended  additional  capacity,  4,600  MW  was\nalready under construction or in the early stage of planning and the balance of 5,200 MW was\n\n\f7\n\nrecommended  to  be  implemented  by  the  private  sector.  Under  a  low  demand  scenario,  the\n5,200 MW additional capacity was projected to be reduced to 3,200 MW but increased to 7,200\nMW under a high demand scenario.\n\nIntroduction of IPPs and Private Investment.  The Government formulated the 1994\n26.\npower  policy  and  invited,  for  the  first  time,  the  IPPs  to  invest  in  the  power  sector  in  Pakistan.\nThe World Bank assisted the Government in formulating the framework of IPPs\u2019 involvement in\nthe power sector. The policy allowed full flexibility to the IPPs to bring capacity on line as quickly\nas  possible  at  predetermined  power  purchase  prices.  The  Government  guaranteed\nimplementation,  fuel  supply  and  power  purchase.  To  attract  the  first  private  investment  of  the\nIPPs into the power sector and to cover the risks perceived by the investors, the Government\noffered generous tariffs. In 1993, construction started on Hub Power Plant Company (HUBCO),\nwith a capacity of 1,292 MW and a negotiated tariff based essentially on a \u201ccost plus\u201d approach.\n\n27.\nPower  Rates  for  IPPs.  The  Government  agreed  to  an  average  purchase  price  of\nelectricity from the IPPs for the first 10 years at $0.060/kWh which was subsequently increased\nto $0.065/kWh. However, high front-end loading of the tariffs to meet the developer\u2019s cash flow\nrequirements  resulted  in  tariffs  in  the  initial  years  being  as  high  as  $0.083/kWh.  An  additional\npremium  of  $0.0025/kWh  for  the  first  10  years  was  also  offered  for  projects  commissioned  by\n1997.  Furthermore,  a  mechanism  was  provided  for  indexation  of  certain  tariff  components\nbased on the rupee\u2019s exchange rate against the US dollar, fuel price variation, and inflation. In\naddition  to  the  generous  private  power  purchase  rates  of  the  IPPs,  the  agreements  stipulated\nthat  if  the  Government  bought  less  or  no  power  due  to  lower  demand,  the  Government  (or\nWAPDA) would still pay the IPPs for 60.0 percent of their plant capacity. With these attractive\nGovernment  incentives,  19  IPP  projects  arose  and  brought  over  $3.0  billion  to  install  about\n3,500 MW capacity.  This does not include funds for HUBCO, which included financing from the\nWorld  Bank  and  WAPDA\u2019s  Kot  Addu  plant,  which  later  was  privatized  and  became  Kot  Addu\nPower Company (KAPCO).\n\n28. \nAdvantages  and  Disadvantages  of  the  1994  Power  Policy.    The  advantages  of  the\npolicy  included  quick  implementation,  and  access  to  global  capital  and  technology  resources.\nThe  drawbacks  related  to  the  absence  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,\nunstaggered timing of the plants\u2019 commissioning, poor planning of the location of power plants,\nand the inappropriate choice of imported furnace oil fuel for the IPPs power plants. The policy\nhas been successful in rapidly bringing foreign capital for new power generation capacity, it also\nprovided guaranteed high energy prices to IPPs. The IPPs\u2019 new generation power plants were\nbased  on  imported  fuel  oil,  and  were  licensed  to  be  located  far  from  the  load  centers  in  the\ncentral  and  northern  areas  of  Pakistan,  thus  putting  severe  strain  on  the  country\u2019s  physical\ninfrastructure,  including  the  electricity  transmission  system.  With  the  commissioning  of  some\nIPP  power  plants  in  1997,  WAPDA  and  KESC  purchased  electricity  from  these  IPPs.  From\n1998, Pakistan has had excess capacity with the utilities contracted to purchase expensive IPP\nelectricity while their own plants are underutilized.\n\n29.\nGovernment Payments for Private Power Purchase.  The Government paid PRs35.6\nbillion ($0.7 billion) in FY1997 and PRs57.3 billion ($1.10 billion) in FY1998, to purchase power\nfrom the IPPs. Most of the payments went to two private sector power operators\u2013HUBCO and\nKAPCO, which together have a combined capacity of about 2,900 MW.  Since then, nine IPPs\nwith  a  total  combined  capacity  of  about  1,940  MW  have  started  operating.  The  Government\nclaims that it is buying power from HUBCO at $0.118/kWh because of the \u201ccost plus\u201d provision\nof  the  tariffs  and  because  HUBCO\u2019s  operations  are  curtailed  to  about  45.0  percent  of  its\ncapacity, since WAPDA is not in a position to purchase much of HUBCO\u2019s output. When all the\n\n\f8\n\nIPPs  are  commissioned,  the  Government  (or  WAPDA)  will  have  to  pay  them  about  PRs300\nbillion ($5.8 billion) over the next three years (up to FY2003) for electricity, all of which may not\nbe  used.  The  payment  to  the  IPPs  has  adversely  affected  the  Government  financing  of  other\npublic enterprises in the power sector. The Government contends that the $0.065/kWh rate of\nthe  IPPs,  as  per  their  agreement  with  the  previous  Government,  is  unaffordable  for  a  country\nlike Pakistan. As a result of the large payments to IPPs during FY1996 and FY1997, WAPDA\nand KESC have faced serious liquidity problems.  KESC has defaulted on its fuel payments to\nthe Pakistan State Oil Company (PSOC), Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), and\nthe  oil  refineries.    WAPDA  was  the  root  cause  of  the  National  Refinery  defaulting  on  its  loan\npayment to the Islamic Development Bank. The previous Government pressured the IPPs into\nlowering the tariffs and to coerce a confession of corrupt practices in securing approvals of their\nprojects.  A  summary  of  the  IPP  controversy  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The\nfunding  agencies,  including  ADB,  advised  the  Government  that  it  should  delink  the  corruption\nissue  from  the  tariff  structure  and  resolve  the  IPP  issue  in  an  amicable  and  business-like\nenvironment, and within the framework of contractual agreements.\n\nPower  Subsector  Performance.    The  power  sector  in  Pakistan  has  a  relatively  poor\n30.\noperational  performance  and  retail  tariffs  averaging  below  the  long-run  marginal  cost,  due  to\nsubsidization of power to most residential and agricultural consumers. Notwithstanding this, the\nsector has consistently recorded profits in the past. This is largely due to the low book value of\nthe operating assets resulting in low depreciation expenses, and the Government\u2019s financing of\nthe  sector  on  terms  well  below  market  rates.    In  FY1996,  WAPDA\u2019s  profits  represented  36.0\npercent of operating revenues. The situation, however, changed dramatically in FY1997 with the\ncommissioning  of  IPPs  whose  power  cost  almost  twice  as  much  as  WAPDA\u2019s  thermal\ngeneration or four times WAPDA\u2019s average hydro-thermal generation. This was compounded by\ndeterioration in operating efficiencies, particularly for KESC, and a two-fold increase in domestic\ncost  of  fuel.  As  a  result,  the  sector  recorded  losses  in  FY1997,  with  WAPDA\u2019s  losses\nrepresenting  2.0  percent  of  revenues  and  KESC\u2019s  losses  at  34.0  percent  of  revenues.  The\nsector\u2019s total liabilities amounted to PRs233.0 billion ($4.5 billion) as of 30 June 1997. Also, the\nconstruction by WAPDA of the Ghazi Barotha and Chashma hydropower projects slowed to a\nvirtual  halt  due  to  lack  of  counterpart  funds.  The  status  of  the  Ghazi  Barotha  and  Chasma\nhydropower  projects  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The  sector\u2019s  persistent\noperational inefficiencies, high cost of operations, and retail tariffs that do not cover the cost of\noperations,  have  eroded  the  operating  margins,  profitability,  and  cash  flows.  These  have\nresulted  in  the  sector\u2019s  weak  self-financing,  debt  service,  and  liquidity  capabilities  and  its\ncorresponding noncompliance with financial health covenants with ADB.\n\n31.\nKESC\u2019s  performance  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  recent  years.  Its  equity  has\nbecome negative due to accumulated losses since FY1998. KESC\u2019s long-term debt in FY2000\nrepresented  103.9  percent  of  total  fixed  assets  and  its  current  ratio  is  at  an  alarming  level  of\n0.53  times.  KESC  has  been  unable  to  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  meet  its  capital\nexpenditure requirement, debt service obligations and a part of operational expenses. KESC\u2019s\nworsening financial health is threatening its operations, adversely impacting the viability of the\nenergy  sector,  and  causing  cash  flow  problems  to  its  fuel  suppliers,  which  is  affecting  their\nprivatization. Supplementary Appendix D summarizes KESC\u2019s financial performance.\n\n32.\nThe main factors driving KESC\u2019s net losses and weak cash flows are excessive levels of\ntransmission  and  distribution  losses,  the  high  cost  of  fuel  (which  has  not  been  matched  by\nadequate adjustments in tariff levels), the increased purchase and high cost of electricity from\nIPPs, and poor revenue collection and high levels of uncollected receivables. Transmission and\ndistribution losses have been on the rise and in FY2000 were estimated at about 60.0 percent.\n\n\f9\n\nThis  high  level  of  losses,  although  partly  attributed  to  technical  constraints,  is  primarily  due  to\ntheft. KESC\u2019s full dependence on thermal generation makes it sensitive to increases in the cost\nof fuel.  Fuel expenses accounted for an increasing share of operating revenues. In addition, the\nprice  of  furnace  oil,  which  is  KESC\u2019s  main  fuel,  has  more  than  doubled  since  FY1996.  This\nsignificantly eroded KESC\u2019s operating margins and profitability over time.  The current plans of\nthe  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  to  introduce  automatic  adjustments\nin  tariff  structure  for  passthrough  items,  are  expected  to  help  alleviate  KESC\u2019s  sensitivity  to\nadverse movements in fuel prices and to achieve a better congruence between KESC\u2019s revenue\nbase and cost structure.\n\n33.\nKESC currently buys power from GUL AHMED, Karachi Nuclear Power Plant, Pakistan\nSteel  Mills  Corporation,  and  TAPAL  Energy.  While  power  from  Independent  Power  Producers\n(IPPs)  only  accounted  for  10.4  percent  of  operating  revenues  in  FY1996,  it  was  about  46.4\npercent  of  operating  revenues  in  FY2000.  Furthermore,  KESC\u2019s  average  IPP  costs  have\nincreased  from  PRs128.26/kWh  in  FY1996  to  PRs329.78/kWh  in  FY2000.  This  substantial\nincrease  in  IPP  costs,  was  much  higher  than  the  yearly  increases  in  average  revenues,  also\ncontributed  to  reductions  in  KESC\u2019s  operating  profits  and  profitability.  KESC\u2019s  poor  revenue\ncollection  is  reflected  in  its  large  receivables  in  FY2000  of  PRs11.7  billion.  KESC  is  required\nunder ADB\u2019s proposed Program loan to improve its liquidity position by reducing receivables to\n3.0 months of energy sales by the end of FY2003.\n\n34. WAPDA\u2019s financial performance started to deteriorate in FY1997, and has been unable\nto meet its financial covenants. Supplementary Appendix E outlines the status of WAPDA and\nKESC\u2019s  performance  target  compliance.  The  primary  factors  driving  WAPDA\u2019s  declining\nliquidity, cash flow, and profitability relate to its poor bill collection and high level of receivables\nfrom federal and provincial governments due to their inability to pay, increasing purchase from\nIPPs  at  price  levels  much  higher  than  average  tariffs,  high  levels  of  system  losses,  large\nincreases  in  fuel  costs,  inadequate  tariff  increases,  and  decreased  growth  in  power  demand.\nHowever,  in  FY1999,  WAPDA  recovered  net  income  with  substantial  improvements  of  key\nfinancial ratios.\n\n35.\nAs  of  30  June  2000,  the  cumulative  stock  of  federal  and  provincial  government\nreceivables (including all arrears) grew to PRs29 billion from PRs19 billion on 30 June 1998. To\naddress WAPDA\u2019s liquidity crunch, the Government converted WAPDA\u2019s pending debt service\nliability of PRs36.3 billion into equity in FY2000. Since then, WAPDA has been current on all its\npayment obligations.  WAPDA\u2019s cost of power from IPPs represented 48.5 percent of revenues\nin FY1998. In FY1998 for example, the unit cost of IPP-generated power was at least 4.2 times\nWAPDA\u2019s average unit generation cost (thermal and hydro) and about 2.1 times WAPDA\u2019s unit\nthermal generation cost (Supplementary Appendix A). Since FY1999, due to a dispute about the\npower purchase agreements (PPAs) with HUBCO and KAPCO, WAPDA has paid reduced rates\nto  these  two  power  suppliers  under  court  orders.  Consequently,  WAPDA  carries  a  contingent\nliability  of  about  PRs26  billion  as  of  30  June  2000.  WAPDA\u2019s  fuel  costs  for  its  thermal  power\nplants have steadily increased. Its fuel oil cost per unit of thermal power generated doubled from\nPRs84.1/kWh  in  FY1996  to  PRs161.06/kWh  in  FY1998,  and  rose  to  PRs181.03/kWh  in\nFY2000.  Increase  in  fuel  cost  also  contributed  to  higher  power  purchase  cost  from  the  IPPs,\nwhich  were  all  thermal-fired.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  summarizes  WAPDA\u2019s  financial\nperformance.\n\nBecause public and private consumers are not paying their bills to WAPDA and KESC,\n36.\nthey  have  been  unable  to  service  obligations  to  fuel  suppliers  and  loan  creditors.  As  of  June\n2000, the total arrears of the government and private customers owing to WAPDA amounted to\n\n\f10\n\n$562  million  and  $483  million,  respectively.  This  forced  WAPDA  to  default  on  its  debt  service\nliability to the Government, and its loan arrears amounting to approximately $700 million were\nconverted  into  equity  in  FY2000.  Although  WAPDA  is  current  on  all  fuel  and  debt  service\nobligations,  its  substantial  arrears  from  the  public  sector  are  a  formidable  obstacle  for\nrestoration  of  financial  soundness.  Having  been  strongly  urged  by  the  ADB  and  the  WB  to\nresolve this issue, the GOP settled all the public sector arrears developed from January 1999 to\nJune  2000.  It  was  also  decided  by  the  GOP  that  the  arrears  prior  to  January  1999  should  be\nwritten  off  except  for  the  arrears  from  the  Government  of  Sindh.  To  KESC,  receivable  arrears\nfrom  private  consumers  amounting  to  $299  million  have  been  a  major  cause  for  its  liquidity\nproblem.  KESC  has  been  unable  to  service  its  payment  obligations  to  fuel  suppliers,  the\nGovernment,  and  WAPDA  even  after  a  comprehensive  debt  restructuring  in  FY1998.  As  a\nresult,  KESC\u2019s  payable  arrears  as  of  June  2000  amount  to  $379  million  comprising  fuel  and\npower purchase arrears of $308 million and loan arrears of $71 million. The major elements of\nthe sector\u2019s debt as of June 2000 are shown in Appendix 3.\n\n2.  Natural Gas and Petroleum\n\n37.\nThe  natural  gas  and  petroleum  in  Pakistan  have  traditionally  been  controlled  by  the\nGovernment, which acts as owner, regulator, and policy maker.  The Ministry of Petroleum and\nNatural  Resources  (MOPNR)  is  the  administrative  arm  of  the  Government,  and  is  responsible\nfor all aspects relating to natural gas and oil.  Pakistan has indigenous reserves of natural gas,\noil, and coal, which provide 61.0 percent (24.7 million tons of oil equivalent [toe]) of the total net\nprimary  energy  supplies  of  40.4  million  toe.  The  primary  energy  supply  mix  of  Pakistan  in\nFY1998 consisted of oil (43.9 percent including petroleum products), natural gas (37.3 percent),\nhydroelectricity (13.0 percent), coal (5.1 percent), and other sources such as LPG and nuclear\nelectricity (0.7 percent). A number of public and private firms are involved in exploring for and\nproducing  oil  and  gas  in  Pakistan,  and  a  number  of  international  firms  are  involved  in  a  large\nnumber  of  joint-venture  partnership  operations  with  Government  entities.  The  refining  and\nmarketing of oil products are dominated by international and domestic stakeholders with public\nand  private  ownership  interest.  The  two  state-owned  enterprises,  Sui  Southern  Gas  Company\n(SSGC)  and  Sui  Northern  Gas  Pipeline  Company  (SNGPL),  undertake  the  purification,\ntransmission,  and  distribution  of  natural  gas  in  the  country.    Pakistan  has  imported  4.0  million\ntons of oil and 11 million tons of petroleum products during the FY2000, at a cost of $2.2 billion,\nto meet its energy needs.  The amount of imported fuel oils will increase due to the increased\ndemand  for  fuel  by  the  power  generation  plants.    This  trend  can  only  be  prevented  if  a\ncomprehensive  plan  is  instituted  to  convert  the  power  plants  using  the  high-cost  fuel  oil  to\nindigenous  sources  of  energy  such  as  natural  gas.    The  natural  gas  is  being  transmitted  and\ndistributed  by  SSGC  in  the  southern  part  of  Pakistan,  and  by  SNGPL  for  the  middle  and\nnorthern  part  of  the  country.    The  combined  transmission  network  is  about  7,600  km  of  high\npressure and about 50,000 km of distribution mains.  The total customer bases for SSGC and\nSNGPL are 1.2 million and 1.5 million, respectively.  A number of new natural gas fields have\nbeen discovered in Pakistan, and are expected to increase the reserves by 20.0 to 25.0 percent.\nThe  gas  sales  agreements  have  been  signed  for  the  supply  of  an  additional  600  million  cubic\nfeet  per  day  (mmcfd)  by  December  2002,  from  the  new  gas  fields.    In  addition,  a  number  of\npotentially rich areas have yet to be explored for further discoveries of gas fields. The additional\ngas  supply  must  be  effectively  and  economically  used  to  facilitate  the  country\u2019s  economic\nrecovery.  The  private  sector  is  negotiating  with  the  Government  for  capital  investment  in  the\ntransmission networks system of the country.\n\n38. While the natural gas and petroleum subsector has great potential to expand and meet\nPakistan\u2019s growing demand, the recent performance of the sector has been less than optimal.\n\n\f11\n\nThe pace of development and private sector investment in the subsector have been lower than\nanticipated due to the inappropriate policy framework, government interference, and inefficient\nutility  operations.    The  situation  is  aggravated  by  Pakistan\u2019s  prevailing  political  and  economic\nsituation.  The resulting increased dependency on imported furnace oil and petroleum products\nhas caused the country\u2019s current account deficit to expand to unmanageable proportions.  The\nsituation is projected to worsen as the lack of available commercial energy is likely to become a\nserious  constraint  on  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  recovery,  and  the  quantity  of  imported  energy  will\ncontinue to increase unless domestic natural gas and oil resources are discovered and brought\ninto production quickly. Because of large capital requirements in the subsector, the Government\nhas formulated an attractive package of incentives to encourage the private sector to invest in\nthe  further  development  of  oil  and  gas  fields,  and  to  undertake  exploration,  which  involves\ncapital risk.  These measures are succeeding.\n\nB. \n\nIssues and Constraints\n\n39.\nGovernance.  Governance has emerged as an increasingly important issue in the power\nsector in Pakistan. In recent years, worsening problems in this area have had a major impact on\nmacroeconomic  performance  and  have  hindered  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the\npower sector. Specifically, weak governance has resulted in inefficient utility operations, power\ntheft,  illegal  power  supply,  reduced  billing  and  tariff  collections,  and  nonpayment  of  arrears.\nThese  corrupt  practices  opened  the  way  for  massive  waste  and  contributed  to  the  build  up  of\nthe financial insolvency of the public utilities. While it is difficult to calculate the exact amount of\nelectricity theft, the electricity stolen (used but not paid for) in WAPDA and KESC during 1999\namounted  to  about  $400-600  million  and  $200-250  million,  respectively.  A  theft  of  this\nmagnitude  could  be  possible  only  through  corruption  and  malpractice  at  all  levels  of  the\norganizational hierarchy, the government, politicians, labor, and the society in general.\n\n40.\nInstitutional  Weaknesses.    The  Pakistan  power  sector  has  been  affected  by\ninstitutional and organizational weaknesses that have led to decisions on investments, electricity\ntariff  determination,  and  appointment  of  senior  management  and  staff  becoming  increasingly\npoliticized.  The  organizations  of  WAPDA  and  KESC  have  degenerated  into  unwieldy,\novercentralized,  and  multi-layered  bureaucracies,  dominated  by  political  expediency,  where\nto  decline.  WAPDA\u2019s  scope  has  become\nefficiency  and  quality  of  service  continue \noverextended,  as  it  has  responsibilities  for  water  and  irrigation,  developing  the  private  power\nprogram,  and  planning  and  operating  the  power  system.  Even  with  110,000  employees  in\nWAPDA and about 12,200 in KESC, responsiveness to customers leaves much to be desired.\nOver  time,  lack  of  financial  and  commercial  skills  have  become  major  obstacles  to  the\naccountability,  quick  decision-making,  and  commercial  orientation  needed  to  deal  with  IPPs.\nInstitutional  malaise  was  most  obvious  in  the  recent  abrupt  decline  in  financial  performance,\nblackouts, and high levels of losses and stolen electricity (often the result of collusion between\nWAPDA  and  KESC  staff  and  consumers).  Consequently,  WAPDA  and  KESC  lost  the\nconfidence of their customers, financiers, and the Government.\n\n41.\nTariff Structure and Subsidy.  Until 1998, the Government controlled the tariff setting.\nThe  successive  governments  in  Pakistan  provided  electricity  at  low  cost  to  consumers,\nparticularly the domestic consumers and agriculture.\n\n42.\nOne of the major issues affecting the power sector was the tariff structure, which was not\nbased on a regional and consumer-specific long-run marginal cost (LRMC) but was used as an\ninstrument  to  achieve  political  and  socioeconomic  objectives.  This  resulted  in  a  uniform  tariff\nstructure for WAPDA and KESC, although KESC depended on all thermal generation, which is\n\n\f12\n\ninherently costlier than WAPDA\u2019s hydro-thermal generation. Thus, increases in fuel costs affect\nKESC much more than WAPDA. Furthermore, over the last several years, the Government did\nnot  adjust  the  level  and  structure  of  tariffs  to  the  new  cost  structure  of  the  public  utilities.\nFollowing a decline in real electricity tariffs and a severe financial crisis in the power sector, the\nGovernment announced in March 1998 a weighted average tariff increase of 21.0 percent. Then\nin  March  1999,  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  approved  a  further\ntariff  increase  of  9.4  percent.    The  lifeline  tariff  of  50  kWh  consumption  per  month  is\nPRs1.40/kWh  ($0.0270/kWh)  and  the  average  tariffs  for  residential,  commercial,  and  public\n($0.1393)/kWh,  and  PRs5.88\n($0.0753)/kWh,  PRs7.20 \nlighting  sectors  are  PRs3.89 \n($0.1137)/kWh,  respectively.    The  tariff  for  the  industrial  sector  is  PRs3.55-4.82  ($0.0686-\n0.0932)/kWh.  For agriculture, there are flat rate tariffs and metered rate tariffs, but the recovery\nis  very  low.  The  large  cross-subsidy  between  agriculture  consumers  is  provided  by  the  sector\nitself, and not by the Government. The tariff structure after the March 1999 increase is shown in\nAppendix  4.    NEPRA,  the  sector  regulator,  is  addressing  these  issues  to  rectify  the  situation.\nUnder  the  directive  of  NEPRA,  the  tariff  applications  submitted  to  NEPRA  by  KESC  and\nWAPDA  address  the  issue  of  cross-subsidy  by  targeting  average  domestic  and  agricultural\ntariffs to rise more than commercial and industrial tariffs. In addition, WAPDA continues to install\nmeters  on  the  agriculture  tubewells  and  charge  tariffs  as  per  the  meter  reading  instead  of  the\nflat rate currently in practice.\n\nSimilarly, the tariff structure in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors are not the true\n43.\ncost of exploration, production, transmission, and distribution.  While the gas producers\u2019 prices\nunder the 1994 and 1997 petroleum policy are linked to the international price of crude and fuel\noil, the retail gas prices set by the Government for SSGC and SNGPL have been without any\nadjustments for a few years.  As a result, about 40.0 percent of the natural gas is sold by SSGC\nand SNGPL to consumers below the cost of supply.  This shortfall is funded by the Government\ngas  development  surcharge.    These  two  companies  recover  a  portion  of  the  losses  through  a\nfixed  rate  of  return  on  equity  formula,  and  the  balance  of  the  shortfalls  is  provided  by  the\nGovernment.    To  remove  these  distortions,    the  Government  is  in  the  process  of  deregulating\nthe prices in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors.  The sector regulator is also required to\naddress the issue of sector cross subsidy.\n\nC.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n44.\nThe  Government  became  aware  of  the  shortcomings  of  the  1994  policy  and  with  the\nassistance from ADB4 drafted a new policy that was approved by the cabinet on 1 April 1998.\nUnder this policy, all future power plants will be developed by the private sector on the basis of\ncompetitive  tendering.  The  policy  will  promote  the  use  of  indigenous  energy  sources  (initially\nhydropower  and  coal)  by  inviting  proposals  for  projects  for  development  in  accordance  with  a\nleast-cost generation expansion plan. Unsolicited bids for projects, i.e., those not the subject of\ninvitations,  will  be  entertained,  but  under  strict  quality  control  and  subject  to  competition.  The\nnew  policy  also  attempts  to  simplify  the  bidding,  evaluation  and  licensing  process  under  the\nPrivate Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB). The Government, under the new policy, decided to\nrestructure the power sector and approved the strategic plan that envisaged that KESC will be\nprivatized,  and  WAPDA  separated  into  independent  corporate  entities  responsible  for  thermal\nand  hydropower  generation,  transmission,  dispatch,  and  distribution.    These  corporate  entities\nare to be privatized.\n\n                                                \n4 SSTA No. 2809-PAK: Private Hydropower Policy Study, Final Report issued in February 1998.\n\n\f13\n\nThe Government recognizes that domestic oil and natural gas supply must be expanded\n45.\nto reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported oil.  Priority is being given to the exploration,\ndevelopment, and exploitation of oil and natural gas reserves, and the installation of additional\noil refinery, gas treatment, transmission, and distribution facilities.  Accordingly, the Government\nstrategy  calls  for  (i)  the  process  of  exploration  and  development  of  oil  and  gas  fields  to  be\naccelerated,  and  increased  foreign  investment  in  this  sector  to  be  encouraged;  (ii)  the\ndevelopment  of  recently  discovered,  large  reservoirs  of  gas  to  be  expedited;  (iii)  regulatory\nauthority  to  be  established  for  the  orderly  operations  and  development  of  the  natural  gas  and\npetroleum subsectors; (iv) conversion of power plants from furnace oil to gas to be encouraged;\n(v)  upstream  infrastructure  including  pipelines  to  be  developed  for  efficient  transportation  of\nimports  of  hydrocarbons  and  the  discovered  resources;  (vi)  the  petroleum  sector  to  be\nderegulated  and  the  privatization  process  expedited  for  greater  efficiency,  for  private  sector\ninvestment,  and  for  retirement  of  public  debt;  (vii)  margins  of  oil  marketing  companies  to  be\nrationalized so that they can invest in storage and other infrastructure for oil; and (viii)  the price\nof LPG to be deregulated and the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to be encouraged. The\nGovernment  is  establishing  a  Petroleum  Regulatory  Board  (PRB),  an  independent  sector\nregulator, which is a prerequisite for petroleum sector reforms.\n\nD.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nDuring  FY1984  to  FY1997,  multilateral  and  bilateral  assistance  to  the  power  sector  in\n46.\nPakistan amounted to about $7.5 billion. The major sources were ADB, Japan, and World Bank,\nwhich together provided more than half of the official external assistance. The assistance from\nADB  was  to  both  KESC  and  WAPDA,  while  the  World  Bank  mainly  provided  assistance  to\nWAPDA.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  presents  donor  assistance  to  the  sector.  A  key  policy\nthrust  pursued  through  coordination  of  aid  agencies  has  been  to  evolve  a  strategy  for  the\nprivatization  of  the  power  sector.    The  policy  matrix  prepared  for  the  reform  program  in  the\nsector has been a joint effort of the ADB, World Bank, and Government, with clear delineation of\nthe division of labor between the two multilateral institutions.\n\n1. \n\nFunding Agency Coordination\n\nADB  has  carried  out  policy  dialogue  in  the  sector  in  close  coordination  with  other\n47.\nagencies,  particularly  World  Bank  and  IMF,  on  many  common  policy  covenants.  Main  areas\ncovered  under  the  policy  dialogue  include  restructuring  of  the  sector  and  its  institutions,\nenhanced  private  sector  role, \nintegrated  operations  of  WAPDA  and  KESC  systems,\nrationalization  and  enhancement  of  tariffs,  energy  efficiency  and  demand-side  management,\nreduction of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, and reduction of accounts receivables.\nWhile ADB can claim significant policy and institution-building assistance to the sector, progress\nhas  significantly  slowed  down  in  recent  years  due  to  political  instability,  frequent  changes  in\ngovernment,  and  the  recent  economic  crisis.  The  political  and  law  and  order  problems  in\nKarachi have also affected the progress on KESC\u2019s restructuring and privatization.  The World\nBank is currently formulating a structural adjustment loan (SAL) for Pakistan with multisectoral\nfocus, to be approved in the near future, subject to a Government-IMF agreement on the PRGF\nor similar activity.  The energy sector (power and natural gas) will be a major component of the\nSAL.\n\n2. \n\nCofinancing\n\n48.\nADB  has  vigorously  followed  the  cofinancing  opportunities  in  the  energy  sector  with\ngood  results.  About  $204  million  of  private  cofinancing  (by  Citibank,  and  Export-Import  Bank)\n\n\f14\n\nhas been mobilized for the public sector program and $45 million in private mobilized in 1996 for\ncofinancing ADB\u2019s private sector Fauji Kabirwala Power Co. Ltd. Project, one of the IPPs.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nADB Operations\n\n49.\nSince  the  start  of  the  ADB  operations  in  Pakistan  in  1968,  total  lending  to  the  energy\nsector  in  Pakistan  amounts  to  about  $2.7  billion,  of  which  $2.1  billion  to  the  power  subsector\nand $0.6 billion to the natural gas and petroleum subsectors.  The lending to the energy sector\naccount for about 28.0 percent of total lending to the country.  Three-fourths of the assistance to\nthe power subsector ($1,575 million for 13 loans) has been provided to WAPDA and the rest to\nKESC.  The  ADB  has  been  the  major  source  of  external  assistance  to  the  energy  sector  in\nPakistan, having provided about one-third of total external resources to the sector. The ADB is\nalso by far the main source of external assistance to KESC. In power generation, the ADB has\nsignificantly  contributed  to  major  multi-donor  undertakings  such  as  the  Tarbela  and  Ghazi\nBarotha  Hydropower  schemes.  While  lending  to  the  sector  has  been  significant,  non-lending\nactivities also has been important with a total of $7.92 million provided for 27 TAs. Main areas\ncovered included tariff rationalization and integration, management information systems, power\ngeneration  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance,  institutional  strengthening  and\nrestructuring, and privatization.\n\n2. \n\nADB Strategy\n\nDue  to  its  significance  to  Pakistan\u2019s  overall  economic  recovery,  the  energy  sector  is\n50.\nrecognized  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  as  a  primary  area  for  policy  intervention.\nADB\u2019s sector strategy recommend high selectivity in new public sector investments, with priority\ngiven  to  creating  a  favorable  environment  for  privatization  and  private  sector  involvement.\nPriority  areas  include  (i)  increased  energy  efficiency,  on  both  supply  and  demand  sides;  (ii)\noptimization of the share of hydropower in the generation mix and support to the development of\npublic-private  sector  partnerships  in  hydropower  generation;  (iii)  balanced  energy  generation,\ntransmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv)  continued  interventions  for  sector  restructuring,\nrationalization  of  tariffs,  and  enhanced  private  sector  participation.  The  country  operational\nframework  places  additional  emphasis  on  aspects  of  weak  governance  and  portfolio\nperformance. Both of these issues are important in the energy sector. The plan for Pakistan\u2019s\nenergy  sector  up  to  the  year  2003  is  presented  in  Appendix  5.  It  shows  the  intermediate\nmeasures taken, the achievements up to 2000, and the targets for 2003.\n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nTen  power  projects  approved  up  to  1983  have  been  postevaluated.  All  of  the  projects\n51.\nwere  classified  as  generally  successful.  The  postevaluation  findings  show  an  average\nimplementation delay of 2.4 years (78.0 percent). Five of the projects experienced an average\ncost  overrun  of  about  82.0  percent,  and  the  other  five  an  underrun  of  28.0  percent.  The\npostevaluations draw attention to the need for in-depth analysis of all technical issues before a\nproject is formulated, and the need to comprehensively review cost estimates at appraisal. ADB-\nfinanced  projects  approved  after  1983  reflect  improved  performance.    However,  KESC  and\nWAPDA have been unable to meet the system loss targets, and the financial covenants due to\ninadequate  tariff  adjustments.    The  tariff  adjustments  based  on  social  equity  and  affordability\nconsiderations  have  led  to  a  lack  of  commercial  focus  and  affected  the  capacity  of  these  two\nutilities  to  produce  sufficient  funding  from  internally  generated  sources  to  meet  all  expansion,\n\n\f15\n\nrehabilitation, and reinforcement requirements.  The utilities also lacked focused leadership and\nmanagement  practices  as  well  transparency  in  operational  and  financial  matters.  Most  of  the\nADB-financed  projects  use  the  sector-loan  approach,  which  allows  considerable  flexibility  in\nselection of subprojects, and the use of consultants for formulating the subprojects. As a result,\ncost  overruns  have  been  greatly  reduced.  However,  slow  project  implementation  remains  a\nproblem.  Other  causes  for  implementation  delays  are  slow  appointment  of  consultants,\nbureaucratic procedures, organizational and institutional weaknesses, changes in project scope,\nand shortages of qualified staff.\n\n52.\nThree  main  lessons  can  be  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  power  sector  in\nPakistan.  First,  continued  weak  governance  was  mainly  due  to  the  absence  of  a  sector\nregulator.  The  funding  agencies,  after  the  initial  period  of  financial  assistance  to  the  energy\nsector, should have insisted upon the creation of independent sector regulators. The prevailing\nfinancial and operational crisis in the energy sector could have been averted if the sector was\nregulated by independent regulators. Second, a collective effort of the funding agencies should\nhave  been  exerted  to  enable  private  sector  participation  after  the  initial  years  of  official\nassistance  to  the  Government  for  the  energy  sector.  This  would  have  introduced  competition\nand  resulted  in  the  efficiency  gains.  Third,  the  funding  agencies,  including  ADB,  should  have\ninvolved  civil  society  to  make  them  aware  of  the  overall  operation  of  the  energy  sector  and\npromote the consumer advocacy groups. These issues are the fundamental components of the\nProgram.\n\nV. \n\nTHE ENERGY SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n53.\nPakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  is  facing  a  financial  crisis  which  basically  stem  from  weak\ngovernance,  political  interference  in  decision-making,  poor  staff  morale,  and  disregard  of\nprudent  business  practices.  The  worsening  problems  in  these  areas  have  had  a  major  impact\non  the  financial  performance  of  the  utilities  and  have  hindered  the  effectiveness  and\nsustainability of the energy sector. Weak governance has resulted in inefficient utility operations,\npower  theft,  reduced  billing  and  collection,  and  nonpayment  of  arrears.  These  practices  have\naffected  the  poor  segment  of  the  population  more  than  the  affluent  and  contributed  to  the\nfinancial crisis in the sector. The absence of an immediate policy response for the energy sector\nwould have serious economic repercussions. Therefore, radical reforms and tough adjustment\nmeasures, including market-driven systems, are needed to restore viability in the sector and to\nmake it self-sustaining. ADB support of the Government\u2019s initiatives for structural reforms in the\nenergy  sector  is  considered  essential  given  the  urgent  need  to  introduce  competition  as  the\ndriving  force  for  improvement  and  private  sector  participation  as  a  vehicle  for  creating  a\ncompetitive  environment.  Ensuring  a  stable  supply  of  energy  is  essential  for  the  country\u2019s\neconomic recovery, which will result in additional job-generating activities for the poor as well.\nThe Program provides a sound basis for the Government to carry out reforms and to restructure\nthe  energy  sector.  The  development  of  a  competitive  electricity  market  under  the  reform\nprogram will result in efficiency gains that will have a positive impact on poverty reduction.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n54.\nThe ADB Program for energy sector restructuring seeks to bring together the measures\nto reform the energy sector in Pakistan, speed-up the actions needed for its sustainable growth,\nincrease  efficiency  in  the  use  of  resources  and  improve  customer  focus  in  the  delivery  of\nservices. The ultimate goal is sector economic efficiency and consumer satisfaction. The reform\n\n\f16\n\nstrategy  is  to  restructure  the  power  sector  by  breaking  up  the  sector\u2019s  monolithic  vertically\nintegrated power utilities; facilitating implementation of larger number of private power projects,\ntransmission, and distribution facilities; and introducing market-based reforms into the sector. To\nachieve these objectives, the sector is to be \u201cunbundled,\u201d the state-owned assets in generation,\ndistribution,  and  transmission  to  be  sold  as  separate  business  entities  to  the  private  sector  to\nminimize the cost of electricity by matching supply and demand under market-based conditions.\n\n55.\nThe  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  shared  plan  is  to  move  the  power  sector  from  an\ninefficient state-controlled monopoly to a competitive, market-driven system in order to produce\nthe highest level of customer satisfaction. The strategy is to include integration of WAPDA and\nKESC  into  the  restructured  power  sector.  The  Program  envisions  that  the  Government\u2019s\nfinancial support to the energy sector, including guarantees, would be phased out except as a\nlast resort, e.g., for large, risky projects, or to meet social and environmental objectives such as\nsupplying  energy  to  rural  communities.  Thus,  a  fully  competitive  power  sector  as  envisaged\nunder  the  restructuring  program  will  consist  of  (i)  competitive  generation  with  independent\nsystem operator(s) and a bulk power market; (ii) unbundled, open and nondiscriminating access\nto transmission and distribution services; and (iii) an independent regulatory body for effective\nmarket governance, setting sector standards, ensuring competition in the sector, setting tariffs\nincluding eliminating cross subsidy, and licensing approvals. This will enable the Government to\nachieve  the  longer  term  perspective  of  economic  efficiency  and  consumer  satisfaction.  To\nachieve these improvements, consumers must be aware of the operations of the power sector,\nand the consumer advocacy group needs to be strengthened to increase consumer awareness.\nThese activities will result in better dialogue and enhance the role of the regulatory body. The\nProgram  includes  the  engagement  of  a  public  relations  firm  to  implement  an  educational  and\npublicity campaign to explain to the public in general and to WAPDA and KESC employees the\nGovernment\u2019s  restructuring  and  privatization  program  and  the  resulting  benefits  from  such\nactivities.\n\nThe long-term goal of the ADB\u2019s intervention is to ensure a self-sustaining, efficient and\n56.\ncompetitive power sector able to provide required quantities of quality power at least cost to the\nconsumer. In order to achieve this, the Program will focus on the seven key areas of reforms: (i)\nenhancing governance; (ii) enhancing the legal and regulatory framework and strengthening of\nthe capacity of the power sector regulator; (iii) financial restructuring and privatization of KESC;\n(iv) restructuring of WAPDA and privatization of corporatized entities; (v) enabling a competitive\nelectricity  market;  (vi)  resolving  the  IPP  issues  and  HUBCO  and  KAPCO  cases;  and  (vii)\nenhancing reform in the natural gas and petroleum subsector. Appendix 1 outlines the Program\nand its timetable.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n1. \n\nEnhancing Governance\n\n57.\nBecause weak governance is one of the major causes of the financial crisis in the power\nsector, the Government has taken action to strengthen and expedite the accountability process.\nKey elements of the Government\u2019s action plan, using the military services, include (i) ensuring\neffective  law  and  order  in  KESC  and  WAPDA  franchise  areas;  (ii)  dismantling  illegal\nconnections and prosecuting offenders in civil courts; and (iii) disconnecting power supplies to\nall consumers with notices of legal action to those who do not pay their bills, including the elite\nand  the  politicians.  These  Government  actions  have  provided  encouraging  financial  results,\nespecially  to  WAPDA,  and  have  reduced  WAPDA\u2019s  peak  demand  by  about  1,000  MW.    The\nactions  are  expected  to  reduce  the  same  demand  by  another  2,000  MW  by  June  2001.  In\n\n\f17\n\naddition, KESC and WAPDA have instituted measures to reduce theft and improve the overall\noperational and financial performance (Appendix 6).\n\n58.\nThe results through army intervention may not be sustainable when the army withdraws.\nThe  improvement  will  last  only  when  the  public  utilities  are  privatized.    Thus,  appropriate\nreforms  and  necessary  adjustment  measures,  including  privatization  of  the  utilities,  are\nexpected to help weed out corrupt practices and political interference. The expanded role of the\nsector regulator under the Program will also ensure good governance and efficient performance.\nThese measures will result in efficiency gains and will minimize the need for frequent excessive\ntariff adjustment, thereby providing a positive impact on poverty reduction.\n\n2.\n\nEnhancing the Legal and Regulatory Framework and Strengthening NEPRA\n\n59.\nThrough  the  reform  Program,  NEPRA  was  established  as  an  independent  sector\nregulator  under  the  Act  of  the  Parliament.    A  four-member  board  was  appointed  and  the\nchairperson is expected to be appointed in January 2001.  NEPRA has taken important steps to\ncomplete the regulatory framework.  It has established a tariff regime, prescribed standards and\nprocedures  to  determine  and  revise  tariffs,  issued  application  and  modification  procedure\nregulations,  and  issued  procedures  for  the  application  of  service  licenses.    NEPRA  is\nresponsible  for  issuing  licenses,  franchising  monopoly  business,  setting  and  enforcing\nperformance  standards  and  codes  of  practices,  enforcing  competitive  policies,  and  setting\ncharges  for  the  monopoly  parts  of  the  industry.    It  will  also  impose  special  levies  and  license\nfees, in line with the prevailing regulations.  NEPRA, under the Act, is mandated to protect the\nconsumers  against  monopolistic  prices,  encourage  efficiency  in  licensee  operations  through\nfinancial  incentives,  encourage  economic  efficiency  by  promoting  competition,  and  eliminate\ncross-subsidies between regions and consumer groups.  The Act includes the legal framework\nfor establishing of a competitive electricity market, where generation companies can negotiate\nthe  price  of  electricity  with  willing  customers.  The  Act  also  includes  the  establishment  of  a\nsystem operator and a power exchange with the responsibility to maintain a secure and reliable\nbulk power supply. ADB provided TA5 to assist NEPRA in strengthening its capabilities.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Restructuring and Privatization of KESC\n\n60.\nRestructuring.    In  November  1998,  the  Government  approved  a  financial  package  of\nabout  PRs33.00  billion  ($638  million)  to  cover  KESC\u2019s  cumulative  cash  shortfalls  for  FY1996  to\nFY1998.    This  amount  was  included  in  the  IMF\u2019s  ESAF.    KESC\u2019s  financial  restructuring  plan\naimed to restore its positive net worth, which eroded over time with sustained losses, and improve\nits liquidity position. The comprehensive restructuring package allowed KESC to wipe out all the\ncumulative cash shortfalls up to June 1998.  However, KESC failed to achieve the targeted level\nof  account  receivables  and  T&D  losses,  and  theft  continued  to  increase  at  an  alarming  rate.\nCoupled  with  the  adverse  impact  of  the  fuel  price  surge,  KESC  has  continued  to  incur  cash\nshortfalls since June 1999, and its negative net worth is growing.   KESC\u2019s financial condition is\nextremely  serious.    KESC  will  continue  to  incur  cash  shortfalls  during  the  coming  years.    The\ncumulative  KESC  funding  shortfall,  under  the  base  scenario,  for  June  2000  to  June  2003  is\nprojected  at  PRs61.9  billion  ($1.2  billion,  excluding  financing  charges).  The  Government  has\nguaranteed the provision of KESC\u2019s cumulative cash shortfalls of PRs61.9 billion, to keep it afloat,\nat  least  until  it  is  privatized,  which  is  expected  by  December  2002,  with  financial  close  in  June\n2003.  Details  are  in  Appendix  7.  To  keep  KESC  solvent  until  it  is  privatized,  additional  financial\n\n                                                \n5 TA 3409-PAK: Capacity Building of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, for $1,000,000, approved on\n\n3 June 2000.\n\n\f18\n\nrestructuring,  as  recommended  by  the  privatization  adviser,    will  be  necessary  and  will  have  to\ninclude conversion of KESC\u2019s debt service liability to the Government into equity and refinancing\nthe term finance certificates by bonds with longer maturity.\n\nPrivatization. The Government has been involved, since February 1996,  in privatizing\n61.\nKESC by selling 51.0 percent of KESC\u2019s share capital and turning management control over to\na  strategic  private  investor.    To  oversee  the  process,  the  Government  constituted  a  panel\ncomprising the representatives of the Privatization Commission, ministries of finance, water, and\npower;  and  KESC.    The  Government  used  the  services  of  two  financial  advisers  for  KESC\nprivatization.    The  work  done  by  the  first  financial  adviser  broadly  covered  privatization  and\nsales  strategy;  business  and  operational  issues  of  KESC;  and  recommendations  for  the\nrestructuring and related action plans.  These activities were taken over by a second financial\nadviser who was appointed to complete the process of KESC privatization by December 1998.\nHowever,  the  country  faced  an  unprecedented  financial  and  economic  crisis,  and  the\nprivatization  was  further  delayed.  Consequently,  the  agreement  with  the  second  financial\nadviser was terminated in December 1999.  As a result, a new privatization adviser is required\nto privatize KESC.\n\n62.\nThe decision to privatize KESC has been postponed since 1996, due to frequent change\nof  governments  and  the  vested  interest  of  the  people  in  power,  and  the  IPP  controversy.  The\ncommitment  of  the  present  Government  to  privatize  KESC  is  considered  by  the  funding\nagencies  to  be  irreversible  due  to  several  factors.    The  most  important  factor,  is  that  the\nGovernment  recognizes  that  it  cannot  afford  to  continue  to  support  KESC  (para.  60)  as  such\nsupport  has  destroyed  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  framework  and  threatens  it\u2019s  financial\nsolvency.  Thus, the Government decided that KESC must be privatized quickly.  Based on this\ndecision,  the  Privatization  Commission  provided  ADB  with  the  Government\u2019s  time  frame  for\nsteps leading to the privatization of KESC.  The ADB Program will support the privatization of\nKESC,  and  help  ensure  that  the  process  of  bidding,  evaluating,  and  selecting  a  strategic\ninvestor is transparent and undertaken on a competitive basis.  The Government is committed\nto comply with these ADB requirements.\n\n63.\nIn  support  of  its  privatization  program  in  August  2000,  the  GOP  approved  the\nprivatization  law  to  give  legal  cover  to  the  privatization  process.    The  law  mandates  that  90.0\npercent  of  the  sale  proceeds  are  to  be  used  for  debt  retirement  and  10.0  percent  for  poverty\nalleviation.   The privatization  law  covers the process of transactions and protects the rights of\nthe buyers and consumers.  To secure the interest and confidence of the private investors, the\nlaw  stipulates  that  a  Government  agency  may  not  investigate  any  transactions  one  year  after\nthe completion of the transaction.  Furthermore, the Government has formulated the draft labor\npolicy  guidelines  in  consultation  with  employees  and  employers,  organizations,  and  the\nprovincial governments.  These guidelines are being used to develop a new labor policy, which\nwill protect the rights of workers and employers.  Furthermore, the Government has announced\na  detailed  list  of  public  sector  enterprises,  including  KESC,    that  must  be  privatized.    The\ndecision to privatize the public assets is also in response to requirements of IMF\u2019s SAL, and the\nPRGF,  which  mandates  the  Government  to  retire  the  country\u2019s  debt  out  of  the  sale  proceeds.\nTo create a favorable environment and to rebuild the confidence of the private sector to invest in\nthe power sector, the Government has resolved the IPP issue by signing an orderly framework\nsatisfactory  to  all  concerned,  and  is  finalizing  the  outstanding  cases  against  HUBCO  and\nKAPCO. To build further confidence among strategic investors, the Government has established\nNEPRA, an independent sector regulator, to ensure that the interests of the consumers and the\ninvestors are protected, and that the sector moves toward a competitive environment.\n\n\f19\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  provided  a  TA  for  the  privatization  of  KESC.6\n64.\nThe  TA  will  engage  the  services  of  an  internationally  renowned  and  experienced  privatization\nadviser to complete the process of KESC privatization. The privatization adviser will be required\nto  engage  and  mobilize  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  experts  (consortium)  from  its  own\norganization  or  from  outside  sources  as  necessary,  with  skills  and  experience  in  restructuring\nand privatizing utilities, financial restructuring, electric utility operations and management, labor\nissues and human resource planning, legal review and analysis, and technical and financial due\ndiligence.    The  privatization  adviser  will  formulate  a  labor  restructuring  plan  in  preparation  for\nprivatizing  KESC  and  will  provide  an  analysis  of  options  and  costs  for  the  labor  strategy  for\ndiscussion and finalization by the Government and ADB\u2019s review.  A federal steering committee\nat Islamabad and a KESC privatization cell at Karachi have been established to coordinate and\nexpedite  the  process  of  KESC  privatization.    To  accelerate  the  process,  the  Government  has\nprovided $1.0 million cash to match ADB\u2019s budget allocation of $1.0 million for the TA costs, and\nagreed  that  its  share  of  $1.0  million  could  be  disbursed  first  for  payments  of  the  privatization\nadviser\u2019s services.\n\nADB is encouraging the Government to consider proposals to sell further equity stakes\n65.\nfrom its remaining 42.0 percent share in KESC, since sales will help build up the market\u2019s and\nthe strategic investor\u2019s confidence and facilitate the overall privatization process in Pakistan.\n\n4.\n\nRestructuring of WAPDA and Privatization of Corporatized Entities\n\n66.\nFinancial Restructuring.  To help improve WAPDA\u2019s liquidity, the Program requires (i)\nthe Government, provincial governments, and private consumers to reconcile all billing disputes\nwith  WAPDA,  and  pay  in  cash  the  amounts  past  due  to  WAPDA;  (ii)  WAPDA  to  implement\nmeasures  to  ensure  timely  payment  of  bills  from  government  departments  and  agencies;  and\n(iii)  WAPDA  to  reduce  its  payables  to  normal  commercial  levels.  WAPDA\u2019s  theft  and  loss\nreduction  program  is  outlined  in  Appendix  6.    To  restore  WAPDA\u2019s  financial  viability,    the\nGovernment  converted  into  equity  WAPDA\u2019s  pending  debt  service  liability,  amounting  to\nPRs36.3 billion in FY2000.\n\n67.\nUnbundling  of  WAPDA.  Under  the  restructuring  program,  WAPDA  has  already  been\nunbundled,  i.e.,  the  Power  Wing  and  all  its  operational  departments  has  been  detached  from\nWAPDA. Thus, WAPDA is left with the Water Wing for water resources management, including\nhydro  generation.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  shows  the  organizational  structure  of  the\nunbundled  WAPDA.  The  WAPDA  Act  was  amended  in  December  1998,  which  allowed  the\nestablishment of the Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) for unbundling of WAPDA into\n(i)  8  distribution  companies  (DISCOs),  formed  from  existing  area  electricity  boards,  and  3\nthermal  generation  companies  (GENCOs),  of  WAPDA\u2019s  11  thermal  generation  plants;  and  (ii)\nthe National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), out of the National Grid Company\nwhich will operate the transmission system and control dispatch.  Under the amended act, the\nunbundled  entities,  including  the  National  Grid  Company,  have  been  corporatized;  consumer\ncontracts have been transferred from WAPDA to the corporatized distribution companies; staff\nof  the  Power  Wing  have  been  transferred  to  the  corporatized  entities,  and  WAPDA  shares  in\ncorporatized  entities  have  been  transferred  to  the  President  of  Pakistan.    The  restructuring  of\nthe  Power  Wing  of  WAPDA  into  separate  corporations  is  essential  and  advantageous  since  it\nwill establish distinct asset blocks to be operated autonomously, and enable a shift to business\norientation  with  the  introduction  of  commercial  practices.  The  primary  focus  of  each  corporate\n\n                                                \n6  TA  3502-PAK:  Support for Privatization of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation  for  $1,000,000,  approved  on\n\n22 September 2000.\n\n\f20\n\nentity will be customer satisfaction and profit. Under the competitive set-up of the restructured\npower  sector  through  the  Program,  there  will  be  no  room  for  the  social  subsidies  that  are\ncurrently  a  part  of,  and  are  hidden  in,  the  unified  accounts  of  WAPDA.  The  subsidies  being\nprovided by the Government through the revenues of WAPDA will be identified, quantified, and\ntransparent,  for  the  Government  to  pay  for  the  services  rendered  by  the  independent\ncorporatized entities.\n\n68.\nThus, the unbundled Power Wing will lead to a structure with several private GENCOs\noperating  under  free  market  conditions,  several  private  regulated  DISCOs  providing  reliable\nelectricity to consumers at a price fixed by NEPRA, and a regulated NTDC.\n\n69.\nCorporatization  and  Commercialization  Program.    As  a  first  step,  eight  DISCOs,\nthree GENCOs, and the NTDC have been registered. To complete the corporatization process,\nthe following are being completed: (i) transfer of assets and liabilities, (ii) transfer of personnel,\n(iii)  financial  restructuring  and  provision  of  working  capital,  and  (iv)  execution  of  all  legal  and\ncontractual agreements.  These actions will allow the new companies to begin to function and\ncarry  out  autonomously  the  business  activities  with  independent  board  of  directors,  financial\nstatements,  legal  and  regulatory  legitimization.  Thus,  the  financial  modeling  and  restructuring,\nasset  allocation  and  evaluation,  transfer  pricing,  and  execution  of  all  legal  documents  and\ncontracts will be effected simultaneously. These activities are under way, and their finalization\nand  consistency  with  the  overall  restructuring  program  will  be  closely  monitored.  The  new\ncompanies  are  designing  and  implementing  the  manpower  transition  program,  management\ninformation systems, and change management initiatives.  A group of management consultants\nis assisting them with all activities related to the restructuring of WAPDA\u2019s unbundled entities.\n\n70.\nPrivatization of WAPDA\u2019s Corporatized Entities. PEPCO is also mandated to sell the\ncorporatized  units.  Under  the  reform  Program,  at  least  one  DISCO  and  one  GENCO  will  be\nprivatized under the ADB program of assistance.  To facilitate the timely sale of the two entities,\nthe  Government  has  amended  the  WAPDA  Act  to  allow  the  transfer  of  WAPDA  shares  in  the\ncorporatized  entities  to  the  President  of  Pakistan,  and  authorized  the  voting  rights    in  the\ncorporatized entities to the Chairman of PEPCO.  The amended Act authorized the transfer of\nconsumer  contracts  from  WAPDA  to  the  distribution  companies.    In  addition,  the  World  Bank\nalso stipulates a number of DISCOs to be taken to the market for sale.  After the completion of\nthe sales, PEPCO will be dismantled and will cease to exist.\n\n5.\n\nEnabling a Competitive Electricity Market\n\n71.\nThe transformation of the power sector into a privatized electricity market in Pakistan will\nbe  an  evolutionary  process  that  may  take  many  years.  The  precise  form  and  timing  of  the\nevolution  cannot  be  predicted  at  this  stage  because  it  will  depend  on  many  intervening  policy\ndecisions and external factors. The power sector will go through a period of transition which will\nlead to a competitive market. The transition period will involve unbundling, corporatization, and\ncommercialization of 12 entities; privatization of KESC; and the sale of at least one DISCO and\none GENCO. The transition period will set the groundwork for future actions; its implementation\nwill be the most critical element of the Program as it will set the foundation for the market-based\nprinciples. During this period, appropriate action will be taken to resolve major issues covering\ntariff  subsidies,  and  a  mechanism  determined  to  establish  transfer  prices  from  generation  to\ntransmission and from transmission to distribution.\n\n72.\nDuring  the  transition  period,  NEPRA  will  regulate  aspects  of  the  electric  power  sector\nthat  remain  a  natural  monopoly,  will  foster  the  competitive  structure,  and  will  ensure  the\n\n\f21\n\nreliability  and  adequate  supply  of  electric  power.  NEPRA  will  ensure  that  the  interests  of  the\ninvestor  and  the  customer  are  balanced  through  judicious  decisions  based  on  transparent\ncommercial principles and prudent investments so that the sector moves toward a competitive\nenvironment.  NEPRA  will  minimize  the  burdens  of  regulation,  in  terms  of  both  the  scope  of\nregulatory  activity  and  interference  with  the  management  of  the  regulated  entities.  As  the\nindustry becomes fully competitive, the need for regulation will diminish.\n\n73.\nAt  present,  a  nationally  uniform  tariff  structure  is  applied  by  WAPDA  and  KESC  with  a\nlarge  degree  of  cross-subsidization.    The  cross-subsidies  will  be  phased  out  during  the\ntransition  period.  The  Government  will  fund  socially  desired  services  directly  under  a\ntransparent  system,  whereas  the  lifeline  tariff  for  poor  households  will  be  cross-subsidized  by\nthe  sector  itself.  With  the  phased  removal  of  most  of  the  tariff  subsidies,  rate  differentials  will\nemerge across the country reflecting the variable cost in providing the power services. One of\nthe  most  critical  issues  during  the  transitional  phase  relates  to  the  human  resources\nrationalization  plan.  While  a  part  of  the  labor  force  will  be  retained  in  the  restructured  power\nsector,  a  large  complement  may  be  retrenched.  The  retrenchment  will  be  subject  to  existing\nrules and regulations and compensation under a transparent system.\n\n74.\nIt  is  envisaged  that  the  restructured  power  sector  may  go  through  two  distinct  phases\nduring  transition  to  a  competitive  electricity  market.    As  the  restructured  sector  matures  and\nproducers,  distributors,  and  regulators  gain  experience,  the  system  should  shift  to  a  fully\ncompetitive  model  by  removing  the  bulk  supply  tariff,  and  allowing  multiple  buyer  and  seller\nagreements.  As  the  market  develops  further,  retail  companies  may  enter  the  market  to  trade\nand provide services to customers.  The two phases leading to a competitive electricity market\nare outlined below.\n\n75.\nPhase 1.  In Phase 1, the system will be the \u201csingle buyer\u201d type, i.e., all energy will be\nbought by NTDC from GENCOs, WAPDA (Water Wing), and IPPs and sold to the DISCOs. The\nconsumers  will  have  no  choice  of  DISCOs  as  the  DISCOs  will  be  restricted  to  supply  power\nwithin their respective franchise areas. During this phase, transfer pricing from the GENCOs to\nNTDC, from NTDC to the DISCOs and the retail price to consumers, will be set by NEPRA. It is\nexpected  that  annual  transfer  prices  and  tariffs  will  be  adjusted  over  time,  according  to  a  pre-\ndetermined formulae, to promote efficiency in each corporation.\n\n76.\nUntil generation and distribution have become fully competitive, the NTDC will stay as a\npublic  sector  company.    The  NTDC  will  not  own  any  generation  or  distribution  assets.    The\nNTDC, being a natural monopoly, will be closely regulated by NEPRA, and will operate as the\n\"single  buyer\"  of  power  from  all  GENCOs.    It  will  ensure  economic  dispatch;  the  integrated,\nstable  and  safe  operation  of  the  electric  power  system\u2019s  future  load  and  system  planning  and\nforecasting;  and  the  wholesale  electricity  market.    It  will  be  responsible  for  forecasting\ngeneration  requirements  by  utilizing  information  provided  by  the  distribution  companies,  the\ngovernment  planners  and  NEPRA.    The  NTDC  will  also  ensure  that  the  requisite  investments\nare made in the transmission network to meet the national needs.  Although under PEPCO, the\nNTDC  will  have  full  financial,  administrative,  and  operational  autonomy  to  ensure  that  its\ndecisions do not discriminate between players in the market and are based on purely economic\nand  commercial  principles  under  the  regulatory  oversight  of  NEPRA.    The  Phase  1  model  is\nlikely to be in place in 5-7 years.\n\nPhase 2.  In Phase 2, the system will be of a \u201cmultiple buyer and seller\u201d type, i.e., the\n77.\nDISCOs  will  have  a  choice  to  buy  electricity  from  any  GENCO  and  use  the  services  of  the\nNTDC for a fee (wheeling charge) to carry the electricity to their respective franchise areas. The\n\n\f22\n\nDISCOs could also buy electricity from the wholesale market provided by the NTDC. The new\nIPPs  will  have  no  PPA  with  the  GOP,  instead  they  will  enter  into  contracts  either  with  the\nDISCOs  or  the  NTDC  or  both.  The  larger  industrial  consumers  of  over  1  MW  will  be  able  to\nchoose  from  which  DISCOs  to  purchase  electricity.  They  will  also  be  able  to  contract  directly\nwith the GENCOs.\n\n78.\nDuring  this  phase,  a  new  market,  known  as  the  pool,  will  be  established  for  trading\nelectricity between generators and suppliers. The pool will not itself buy or sell electricity, but it\nwill  be  constituted  by  agreements  between  those  participating  in  it.  Sales  and  purchases  of\nelectricity  in  this  market  will  be  made  between  the  participating  generators  and  suppliers\naccording to a set of pool rules which will govern the market\u2019s operation and the calculation of\npayments  due  to  and  from  each  of  them.  Because  pool  prices  will  fluctuate,  generators  and\nsuppliers  may  enter  into  bilateral  agreements  known  as  Contracts  for  Differences  (CFDs)  to\nprovide a degree of protection against such fluctuations. CFDs will be used to fix the prices that\nthe supplier pays and the generator receives for electricity traded through the pool. The Phase 2\nmodel should be in place for at least 5-7 years.  Thereafter, the supply brokers may enter into\nthe electricity market who will buy electricity, package it and sell it to the consumers, using the\ngrid of the NTDC and the distribution network of the DISCOs. The DISCOs will no longer have a\nmonopoly  of  the  supply  of  electricity  to  their  respective  franchise  areas.  The  consumers,\nincluding the individual households, will be given a choice of which supplier they will buy from.\nHowever,  the  DISCOs  will  retain  the  ownership  of  their  respective  distribution  networks.  It  is\nenvisaged that most of the DISCOs\u2019 profits will be from rental of their distribution networks to the\nsuppliers.\n\n79.\n\nThe role of NEPRA will be drastically reduced as the competitive structure is in place.\n\n6.\n\nResolving the IPP, HUBCO and KAPCO Issues\n\nThe Government has implemented an orderly framework for resolving the IPP issue. Of\n80.\nthe 19 IPPs, memoranda of understanding entailing revision in tariffs have been concluded with\n13  IPPs,  3  IPPs  are  operating  under  the  original  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs),  1  IPP\nwas cancelled, and 2 others have opted out. The settlement processes for HUBCO and KAPCO\nare  in  progress,  and  the  Government  is  committed  for  adequate  implementation  of  an  orderly\nprocess to resolve the commercial dispute with HUBCO and address the dispute with KAPCO.\nThe resolution of the IPP issue has built some confidence in the market and generated interest\nfrom a few strategic investors for the purchase of KESC and WAPDA\u2019s two corporate entities.\n\n7.\n\nEnhancing Reform in Natural Gas and Petroleum\n\n81.\nThe  Government  policy  is  to  deregulate  the  subsector  and  introduce  market-based\npolicies  and  pricing  mechanisms.    The  Government  plans  to  reduce/eliminate  its  ownership\nholdings in the petroleum subsector, establish a petroleum regulatory authority, and restructure\nthe  natural  gas  subsector.    These  reforms  are  expected  to  build  investor  confidence  and\naccelerate private sector capital flow in the subsectors.  The Government\u2019s role will be limited to\naddressing  the  issues  and  formulating  appropriate  policy  framework.    The  Government  policy\naims at bringing the country\u2019s dependence on energy imports within manageable proportions by\nmobilizing,  to  the  greatest  possible  extent,  all  domestic  energy  resources;  increasing  fuel\nsubstitutions  in  the  industrial  sector;  increasing  efficiency  in  energy  use;  and  implementing\nenergy conservation programs.\n\n\f23\n\nThe Government has formulated a strategic plan for the restructuring and privatizing the\n82.\nnatural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors.    Under  this  policy  initiative,  SSGC  and  SNGPL  will  be\nunbundled, corporatized, and eventually privatized.  In addition, the Government plans to divest\nits ownership in companies involved in the upstream oil and gas activities, the downstream oil\nmarketing firms such as Pakistan State Oil, and other shareholdings in the petroleum sector.  In\nthis regard, the Government extended greater autonomy to the state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\nin    the  petroleum  sector  to  prepare  the  entities  for  their  privatization.  The  SOEs  have  been\nencouraged  to  seek  private  sector  investment  along  with  management  expertise,  including\nnomination  of  private  sector  representations  on  the  boards  of  the  entities.    These  efforts  will\nimprove  the  overall  performance  of  the  SOEs  and  increase  their  market  value  prior  to  the\nplanned  privatization.    The  Government  will  announce  a  new  policy  outlining  the  activities,\nincluding its economic and social objectives in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors.\n\n83.\nTo  provide  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  reform  program  in  the  natural  gas\nand petroleum subsectors, the Government established the Petroleum Regulatory Board for the\noversight  of  the  subsectors.    Furthermore,  the  Government  has  deregulated  the  prices  of\nfurnace oil and introduced quarterly price adjustments that are linked to the international price\nfluctuations.  In addition, the Government will deregulate the impact of diesel phase-out during\nthe  program  period.    To  enhance  the  reform  Program  in  the  subsectors,  the  Government  has\nrationalized the freight pool arrangements for furnace oil and will establish, during the program\nperiod, a phase-out program for the diesel freight pool.\n\n84.\nThe reform Program in the energy sector will be supported jointly by ADB, World Bank,\nand IMF, but with well-defined and specific program elements for each institution to ensure that\nsectorwide  issues  are  addressed  and  the  leverage  of  the  institutions  is  mutually  reinforced.\nBecause of the long association with the two utilities, ADB\u2019s assistance under the ESRP covers\nboth KESC and WAPDA, whereas the World Bank will assist only WAPDA. The policy matrix of\nthe  reform  Program  is  a  joint  effort  with  clear  delineation  of  the  division  of  labor.  ADB,  World\nBank, and IMF will monitor implementation of the reform program.\n\nD.\n\n \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n1.\n\nSocial Issues\n\n85.\nThe ESRP will result in a reduction of the burden on the fiscal deficit and in considerable\noverall efficiency  gains for the economy. As a result it will have positive impacts on economic\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  benefit  the  population  in  Pakistan  as  a  whole.\nAnticipated short-term transitional adverse impacts include labor retrenchment and the effects of\ntariff  increases  on  nonpoor  residential  and  commercial  consumers.  The  direct  and  indirect\nimpacts  on  poor  households  are  expected  to  be  positive.    In  the  long  run,  the  competitive\nelectricity market will result in efficiency gains, lower cost of bulk power, and greater reliability of\nsupply,  which  will  be  captured  by  consumers  at  large.  In  the  short  term,  tariff  increases,\nreflecting cost recovery, may be considered to restore financial health. However, in the longer\nterm,  as  a  result  of  efficiency  gains  from  competition,  increases  will  be  smaller  than  would  be\nnecessary  without  the  restructuring  Program.  The  expected  impacts  of  the  Program  are\nsummarized in Appendix 8 table A8.2.\n\nImpact on Labor.  The program will support the Government\u2019s labor policy \u201cto prevent\n86.\ndistress  from  short-term  interruptions  in  income  streams.\u201d  The  privatization  adviser  to  be\nengaged  under  the  ADB  TA  grant,  will  determine  the  extent  of  labor  restructuring  for  KESC\nbased on a financial evaluation. The impact on retrenched labor will be addressed and mitigated\n\n\f24\n\nby  a  number  of  initiatives  under  the  labor  impact  assessment  (LIA).  Various  options  will  be\nconsidered in consultation with all stakeholders. These may include (i) phasing out excess labor\nthrough  natural  attrition,  (ii)  retraining  for  redeployment  within  KESC  transmission  and\ndistribution departments, (iii) voluntary lay-offs with compensation, (iii) retraining for small-scale\nbusiness  and  other  sectors  of  the  labor  market,  and  (iv)  early  retirement  with  full  benefits.  As\nlabor  costs  represent  a  small  component  of  the  utility\u2019s  total  costs,  and  rather  than  risk  a\npossible  conflict  with  labor  representatives,  phasing  out  by  natural  attrition  and  retraining  are\nlikely  options.    For  each  new  corporate  entity  of  WAPDA,  PEPCO  is  preparing  a  human\nresources  transition  program.    The  program  is  designed  to  absorb  as  many  staff  as  possible\nwith  training  and  through  redeployment  in  the  expanded  transmission  and  distribution  network\nsystem.  Labor retrenchment will be identified together with appropriate compensation packages\nfor implementation when each corporation is privatized.  The Government has agreed that the\ncosts  of  the  human  resources  transition  programs  will  be  estimated  and  sufficient  funds\nallocated for their implementation.\n\n2.  Environmental Issues\n\n87.\nThe  ESRP  will  have  no  direct  environmental  impacts,  but  in  the  longer  term  indirect\nimpacts  should  be  beneficial  due  to  lower  losses  and  demand-side  measures  adopted.  The\neffect of changes in the tariff structure, which will reduce subsidies to agricultural and domestic\ncustomers, will send the correct signals about the real cost of energy to consumers and lead to\na reduction in wastage of energy. This will restrain load growth with consequent environmental\nbenefits.\n\nE.\n\nCost of Adjustment of the Restructuring Program\n\n88. While  it  is  not  possible  to  precisely  determine  the  cost  of  the  comprehensive  ESRP,  it\ncan be broadly estimated at $1.705 billion (Table).\n\nTable.

An  important  part  of  the\nprogram\u2019s restructuring cost includes the cost to help address the circular debt problem in the\npower  sector,  which  is  threatening  to  bankrupt  the  utilities  and  their  fuel  suppliers  and\ncontractors, and endangering Pakistan\u2019s financial solvency. Appendix 7 shows the restructuring\ncost and the financing plan.\n\n90.\nThe remaining $300 million of the restructuring cost relates to the adjustment cost of the\nnatural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors,  of  which  the  Government  has  already  financed  about\n$100 million. In light of the difficult external environment and social and economic problems the\ncountry is facing,  the Government, under the ADB reform Program, has already instituted policy\nreforms  in  the  natural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors,  and  is  committed  to  implement  further\nmeasures  during  the  program  period.  The  Government\u2019s  reforms  in  the  natural  gas  and  the\npetroleum  subsectors  are  already  creating  a  favorable  climate  for  the  private  sector\ninvestments, which are expected to increase the availability of natural gas for use in the power\nplants  currently  using  imported  furnace  oil.    As  a  result  of  the  reforms,  the  new  private  sector\ninvestments  are  expected  to  make  an  additional  600  million  cubic  feet  per  day  of  natural  gas\navailable  in  Pakistan  during  the  next  30  months,  for  use  in  the  power  plants.    The  use  of  the\nnatural gas as a fuel for thermal power generation by the IPPs and other private sector investors\nwill save Pakistan about $3.0 billion in foreign exchange over the next 10 years, or about $300\nmillion annually ($120 million from KESC\u2019s operations alone), thereby reducing substantially the\ncurrent account deficit.\n\n2. \n\nOperating Costs and Other Related Costs of Reform\n\n91.\nAssociated costs of the ESRP, and of setting up NEPRA,  consumer advocacy groups,\nand the privatization commission that are required under the ESRP; the cost of the restructuring\nplans  for  WAPDA,  KESC,  and  the  natural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors;  and  the  expected\ncosts  of  privatization  of  energy  sector  utilities  are  estimated  at  about  $39.5  million.    The\nGovernment has already financed about $23.7 million (about 60.0 percent) of these costs.\n\n3. \n\nLabor Restructuring\n\n92.\nThe  power  sector  currently  employs  about  122,300  people.    While  the  level  of\noverstaffing is currently being reviewed (by the privatization advisers for KESC and PEPCO for\nWAPDA), the overstaffing is assumed to be about 50.0 percent. Initially, about 12,000 workers\nmay  be  retrenched  from  KESC  and  WAPDA  during  the  program  period.    Using  the  historic\naverage  cost  of  retrenchment  compensation  paid  in  Pakistan  of  $4,650  per  worker,  plus  a\nstandard gratuity of $2,350 representing 0.5 months per year of service, the estimated cost of\nlabor retrenchment, including a 10 .0 contingency, is about $98 million.  Such costs will have to\nbe borne by the Government, either as outright payments to retrenched employees or reflected\nas part of the effective sale price to private buyers.\n\n93.\nThe Government has agreed to make additional funds available for extra cash payments\nabove  the  statutory  minimums  for  various  groups  of  laid-off  workers,  to  prevent  them  and  their\ndependents from becoming impoverished.  The Government is undertaking an actuarial study to\n\n\f26\n\ndetermine its pension liabilities to the employees of WAPDA, who will be retained in the privatized\nentities, to ensure that the funds are available to meet all its future obligations.\n\n4. \n\nSkills Development Program\n\n94.\nThe  Government  will  engage  consultants  to  advise  the  retrenched  workers  and  their\nfamilies  on  how  to  manage  the  cash  compensation  received  under  the  retrenchment  plan,\nincluding the setting up of small businesses.  This may also require provision of financial services\nand  other  professional  advice  on  entrepreneur  development  and  training.    The  Government  will\nalso  team  experienced  in  developing  and  implementing  redeployment  packages,  including\ncounseling  services,  consultation  with  stakeholders,  retraining  programs,  outplacement,  and\nformulation  of  special  measures  to  vulnerable  groups.    The  retrenchment  plan  will  include\nassistance  for  implementing  the  program  through  the  provision  of  trainers  and  advisers  and  to\nmonitor the effectiveness of the plan.  The cost of the skills development program is estimated at\n$12.5 million.\n\nA.\n\nAmount of Loans and Source of Funds\n\nVI.     THE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nLoans  totaling  $350  million,  comprising  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\n95.\nresources (OCR) and $50 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be used to support\nthe Government\u2019s reform program for the ESRP. The Government will use the counterpart funds\nfrom  the  Special  Funds  resources  loan  to  meet  the  labor  retrenchment  costs  for  KESC  and\nWAPDA, and the skills development program under the ESRP (paras. 92-94)  The loan size for\nthe ESRP has been determined on the basis of immediate financing requirements, the costs of\nimplementing the ESRP\u2019s structural reforms, including the social costs, strategic significance of\nthe  power  sector,  and  current  financial  position  of  the  Government.  The  cost  of  the  ESRP  is\nestimated at $1.705 billion.\n\n96.\nParallel  financing  by  the  World  Bank  of  $300  million  is  expected,  for  banking,  energy,\nand  public  sector  reform  programs,  under  their  SAL,  which  is  in  line  with  immediate  sector\nadjustment requirements and the external financing gap of Pakistan. Assistance to the energy\nsector under SAL covers7  WAPDA\u2019s unbundling into twelve units, corporatization of unbundled\nunits,  and  privatization  of  a  few  of  these  units.    ADB\u2019s  ESRP  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  SAL  are\nintegral  elements  of  the  IMF\u2019s  current  standby  adjustment  loan  and  the  subsequent  Poverty\nReduction Growth Facility (PRGF) in Pakistan.\n\nB.\n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan.    The  OCR  loan  will  carry  an\n97.\ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate\nsystem for US dollar loans with a maturity of 15 years, including a 3 year grace period, a front-\nend  fee  of  1.0  percent,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum.    The  Special\nFunds resources loan will be provided in various currencies for a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The loans will be utilized over a three-year period\nfrom the date of loan effectiveness.\n\n                                                \n7 In addition to SAL, the World Bank is in the process of formulating a Power Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL).\n\n\f27\n\nThe  loans  will  be  linked  to  timely  implementation  of  the  actions  identified  in  the  policy\n98.\nmatrix and will be released in three tranches.  The Government has already incurred about $786\nmillion in adjustment costs relating to the reforms in place.  The first tranche of $150 million will\nbe made available in December 2000, following compliance with the conditions identified in the\npolicy matrix and upon loan effectiveness.  The first tranche represents only about 25.0 percent\nof the cost already incurred by the Government.  The balance of the adjustment cost, amounting\nto  about  $919  million,  will  be  spent  by  the  Government  during  the  remaining  period  of  the\nProgram.    An  incentive  tranche  of  $50  million,  from  OCR,  will  be  made  available  after  three\nmonths and upon satisfactory compliance with the stipulated conditions.  The second tranche of\n$75  million  is  expected  to  be  released  in  December  2001,  but  this  will  be  depend  on  the\nprivatization  of  WAPDA\u2019s  two  units.    The  third  tranche,  also  $75  million,  will  be  disbursed  in\nDecember  2002,  when  the  condition  relating  to  the  privatization  of  KESC  is  met.    Specific\nconditionalities  are  set  for  the  release  of  the  second  and  the  third  tranches;  however,  if  all\nconditions for the second tranche are met, except the privatization of the two WAPDA entities\n(one DISCO and one GENCO), and the third tranche condition for the privatization of KESC has\nbeen  met,  then  the  two  privatization  conditions  will  be  transposed,  and  all  conditions  for  the\nrelease of the second tranche will be considered to be met.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  It  will  coordinate  and\n99.\nmonitor  the  overall  implementation  of  the  ESRP  loan,  and  administer  the  use  of  the  loan\nproceeds.  MOF  will  be  supported  by  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MWP)  in  the\nimplementation of the sector reforms, including operational improvements of the power utilities\nand the corporatization of WAPDA\u2019s power generation, transmission and distribution activities to\nbe  managed  by  PEPCO,  and  restructuring  of  KESC  and  WAPDA;  (ii)  NEPRA  on  regulatory\nrequirements and tariff issues; and (iii) Privatization Commission on privatization of KESC and\ncorporatized WAPDA entities.\n\n100. A federal steering committee has been established to oversee the implementation of the\nESRP loan.  The committee, chaired by the secretary general (finance) and the chairperson of\nWAPDA and KESC; federal secretaries of MWP, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources,\nPrivatization Commission, and finance; managing directors of KESC; Privatization Adviser; and\nthe  ADB\u2019s  Resident  Representative,  Pakistan  Resident  Mission,  will  meet  at  least  quarterly.\nThe  committee  will  ensure  that  the  reforms  are  undertaken  in  line  with  the  agreed  timetable.\nSimilarly, a KESC privatization cell at Karachi has been established to ensure the completion of\nKESC privatization at the agreed upon time.\n\nD.\n\nProcurement and Disbursements\n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  items\n101.\nproduced in and from ADB member countries other than items specified in the prohibited items\nlist  (Appendix  9),  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The\nGovernment  will  certify  that,  during  each  year  in  which  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  are\nexpected to be disbursed, the value of imports minus imports from ADB nonmember countries,\nineligible  items,  and  disbursements  made  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is\ngreater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year.\n\n102. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy\nof  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  Disbursements  under  the  ESRP  loans  will  incorporate\n\n\f28\n\nsimplified  disbursement  procedures  and  audit  requirements.8  Withdrawals  will  be  allowed\nagainst eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred within 180 days prior to the loan\neffective date. Retroactive financing is justified to ensure timely release of counterpart funds to\nthe Government, which has already incurred a significant part of structural adjustment cost.\n\n103. All  procurement  under  the  ESRP  loans  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial\npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration given to economy and efficiency.\n\nE. \n\nCounterpart Funding\n\n104.\nThe  counterpart  funds  generated  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the\ncost  of  structural  adjustment  and  programs  and  activities  consistent  with  the  ESRP.  ADB  will\nmonitor the use of counterpart funds during program implementation.\n\nF.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n105. All  20  items  listed  in  the  policy  matrix,  as  conditions  for  loan  negotiations  have  been\ncompleted. Similarly, 5 items listed for the release of the first tranche have also been completed.\nWhile the policy matrix also outlines a detailed list of operational monitorable milestones to be\ncompleted prior to the release of the second and third tranches, only four conditions stipulated\nwill  be  for  the  second  tranche  release  and  four  for  the  third.  ADB  will  continue  to  monitor  the\ncompletion status through the progress reports of the federal steering committee, and the KESC\nprivatization cell.  If all conditions for the second tranche are met, except the privatization of the\ntwo WAPDA entities (one DISCO and one GENCO), and the third tranche condition in respect\nof  the  privatization  of  KESC  has  been  met,  then  the  two  privatization  conditions  will  be\ntransposed,  and  all  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  will  be  considered  to  be\nmet.\n\n106.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the  implementation  and  impact  of  the\nESRP loan. The Government will provide at least three reports (May 2002, November 2003, and\nMay  2004)  to  detail  compliance  with  ESRP  loan  conditions  and  facilitate  a  final  review  of\ncompliance with the third tranche conditions of the ESRP loan. ADB will send review missions to\nexamine  compliance  with  the  conditions  of  the  third  tranche  and  advise  on  corrective  action\nrequired to keep the ESRP implementation on course. The review missions will also review the\nproposed TA loan.\n\nVII.     THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\n\n107.\nTo support the energy sector reforms, the Government requested a TA loan for capacity\nenhancement in the energy sector to support the implementation of ESRP.  The TA loan funds\nwill also be used to establish a plan to mitigate the social impact of the ESRP.  ADB will assist\nKESC  with  a  full  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  (PIA)  during  the  program  implementation  to\nmonitor  the  effects  of  restructuring  of  KESC  on  poor  consumers.  The  PIA  will  provide  KESC\nwith tools for reducing theft and corruption, and enhancing consumer services.  The broad terms\nof reference are outlined in Appendix 10.\n\n108. During the Program period, ADB will assist with a full labor impact assessment (LIA) to\ndetermine,  in  advance  of  any  layoffs,  that  adequate  provisions  are  in  place  to  safeguard  the\n\n                                                \n8 R5-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements of Program Loans, 23 March 1998.\n\n\f29\n\nlivelihoods of redundant workers and their families. The terms of reference for the consultants,\nwhich  were  formulated  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders,  are  presented  in  Appendix  10.    If\ninvoluntary layoffs are required, the Government may use a portion of the TA loan funds of $5.0\nmillion  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  a  plan  to  reduce  vulnerability  of  redundant  workers  in\nconsultation with all stakeholders. Such a plan will include cash payments above the statutory\nminimum for laid-off workers, provisions for retraining, and for training on the establishment and\nmanagement  of  small  businesses.  A  team  will  be  engaged  with  experience  in  developing  and\nimplementing  redeployment  packages  in  a  participatory  framework.  The  mitigation  measures\nwill  include  counseling  services,  pension/gratuity  benefits,  and  retraining  programs,  specially\ndesigned  to  meet  requirements  of  the  labor  market.  If  required,  TA  loan  funds  will  be  made\navailable to assist in the implementation and monitoring of the effectiveness of the retrenchment\nplan.  ADB  has  agreed  that  the  Government  may  use  the  proceeds  of  the  ESRP  loan  to  meet\nretrenchment costs for KESC and the privatized entities of WAPDA.\n\nVIII.     PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nA.\n\n \n\n1.\n\nDirect Impacts on the Poor\n\n109. About 75.0 percent of the Karachi population (about 120,000 connections) has electricity\nthrough  legal  connection.  The  estimated  number  of  illegal  connections  is  400,000,  consisting\nmainly  of  poor  residential  consumers.    Appendix  8  table  A8.1  presents  a  dismal  picture  of\nunderbilling of wealthy consumers as being the main cause of KESC\u2019s poor financial state. The\naverage units billed for KESC consumers is well below the national average, although non-poor\nresidential  and  commercial  consumer  amount  to  nearly  80.0  percent  of  the  KESC  consumer\nbase.\n\n110. Given  the  lack  of  empirical  data  for  electricity  expenditure,  the  Mission  conducted  a\nhousehold  survey  in  low-income  areas  of  Karachi  to  assess  the  impacts  on  the  poor.  The\nfindings clearly show that corrupt practices and unreliable electricity supply has disproportionally\naffected  poor  consumers.  Although  non-poor  residential  and  commercial  consumers  are\naffected by power cuts resulting from deteriorating maintenance, these are more frequent and\npersist for longer time periods in low-income areas of Karachi. In addition, non-poor consumers\noften  have  generators  to  overcome  the  inconvenience  of  power  cuts.  Due  to  the  high  initial\ncapital  costs,  generators  are  not  available  for  poor  consumers.  About  36.0  percent  of  the\nhouseholds interviewed lose a significant amount of income as a result of power cuts, and suffer\nadverse impacts on general household welfare, including lack of sleep, mosquito bites, security\nproblems, and loss of studying time.\n\n111. Poor consumers are especially susceptible to corrupt practices in collection, billing, and\nconnection fees. Poor residential consumers spend about 10.0 percent of income on electricity,\nwith large variations between consumers. This is well above international comparisons. For poor\nhouseholds,  with  a  large  share  of  expenditure  on  food,  the  corrupt  practices  have  sometimes\nforced  them  to  sell  their  assets  and  decrease  expenditure  on  food.  The  vulnerability  of  poor\nconsumers  is  exacerbated  because  they  (i)  face  difficulties  monitoring  their  own  electricity\nconsumption  due  to  the  irregularity  of  billing,  lack  of  meter  readings  by  KESC  officials,  and\ngeneral  neglect  in  consumer  services;  and  (ii)  may  be  illiterate  and  unable  to  read  their  own\nmeter.    In  addition,  connection  fees  in  low-income  areas  often  had  a  17.0  percent  \u201cunofficial\u201d\nextra payment.\n\n\f30\n\n112. Corrupt  practices  have  taken  KESC  resources  away  from  the  provision  of  legal\nconnections.  Although  connection  fees  are  a  difficult  hurdle  for  poor  households  to  overcome,\nlegal connections are a high priority for poor households in squatter areas because they reduce\nvulnerability  to  extortion  associated  with  the  illegal  connections,  and  a  legal  connection  is\nperceived to strengthen property rights. Improvements in the billing system, meter readings, and\nconnection services are important tools for reducing vulnerability of poor consumers. However,\nto  address  the  inefficiencies  in  the  billing  and  distribution  departments,  initial  capital  costs  are\nrequired.  KESC  is  trapped  in  a  vicious  circle  of  low  revenue  collection  and  not  being  able  to\ninvest  in  measures  that  would  improve  revenue  collection.  KESC  as  a  public  utility  has  not,\ndespite significant resources and efforts, been able to provide poor consumers with a fair share\nof benefits of the electricity sector.\n\nThe key to addressing the vulnerability of poor consumers is to provide restore long-run\n113.\nfinancial  viability  of  the  electricity  sector  through  restructuring  and  privatization,  laying  the\nfoundation for a competitive and (thus) cost effective electricity market. Although KESC\u2019s acute\nfinancial situation will not primarily be solved by raising tariffs, but rather by reducing theft, tariff\nincreases  reflecting  cost  recovery  may  be  expected  in  the  short  run.  With  the  elimination  of\ncorrupt  practices,  strengthening  of  consumer  groups,  and  lifeline  tariffs,  the  expenditure  on\nelectricity will have significant benefits for poor consumers.\n\n2.\n\nIndirect and Macroeconomic Impacts on the Poor\n\n114.\nThe  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  ESRP  have  wider  implications  for  poverty  than  the\ndirect  effects  on  the  consumers.  Although  the  key  to  reducing  income  poverty  in  Pakistan  is\neconomic opportunities for the poor, it is not sufficient to reduce vulnerability and poverty in the\nlong  run.  Reliable  electricity  supply  is  crucial  for  industrial  and  commercial  development  to\nsecure \nincome-generating  activities.  A  stable  macroeconomic  environment  and  good\ngovernance are key variables for reducing risks and encouraging productive investments. Public\ninvestment  in  KESC  nourish  corruption  and  is  a  significant  source  of  inefficient  allocation  of\nresources  in  the  economy.  It  diverts  public  funds  away  from  sectors  more  productive  for\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. For instance, the cash required to keep KESC afloat for\nFY2000 is nearly proportional to Government expenditure on social services and is more than\n1.7 times the expenditure on education or 5.0 times the expenditure on health. Although these\nfunds may not be fully fungible, the public allocation of funds to KESC is a costly and inefficient\nway to provide electricity and has implications for the budget deficit limiting the options available\nfor the Government. The KESC cash short-fall for FY2000 amounts to 5.2 percent of the fiscal\ndeficit and is projected to increase to 7.2 percent for FY2001. Given the overall fiscal deficit for\nPakistan (6.5 percent of GDP) the Government has limited resources to keep KESC afloat. The\nfiscal  deficit  can  primarily  be  financed  through  increasing  money  supply  or  by  domestic  and\ninternational  borrowing.  Printing  money  causes  inflation  that  acts  as  a  tax,  and  the  burden  of\ninflation  falls  disproportionally  on  the  poor.  Borrowing  crowds  out  private  (and  other  public)\ninvestment, crucial for economic growth and employment generation. Privatization of KESC and\nrestoring financial health in the energy sector will reduce the burden on the Government deficit\nand induce a more efficient allocation of resources for the economy as a whole. Privatization of\nKESC  is  also  strongly  a  governance  issue  that  will  act  to  reduce  political  and  socioeconomic\nrisks.\n\nB.\n\nProgram Benefits\n\n115.\nThe ESRP\u2019s benefits are two-tiered. First, the ESRP is designed to reduce the role of the\nGovernment  in  the  management,  development,  and  operation  of  the  energy  sector.  The\n\n\f31\n\nprivatization of KESC, unbundling of WAPDA, and the creation of smaller corporate entities with\na view to privatizing them, will create an enabling environment for a competitive bulk electricity\nmarket. The electricity price will be based on commercial principles and consumers will benefit\nthrough improved service and reduced prices. Regulatory focus will shift from determining tariff\nlevels  to  ensuring  that  the  competitive  environment  is  maintained,  and  interventions  will\ngradually be limited to social and environmental areas. The Government will continue providing\npolicy directions for the sector in areas such as the use of domestic fuel, rural electrification, and\nsubsidies for poor consumers. Second, the macroeconomic position of Pakistan will improve as\na result of the restored financial viability of the power sector.\n\n116. Socioeconomic growth is also dependent on a swift improvement of the macroeconomic\nframework.  Economic  growth  is  crucial  to  ensure  job  opportunities  for  a  rapidly  growing\npopulation  and  to  generate  the  financial  resources  for  sustained  investment  in  human  and\nphysical  capital  in  the  private  and  public  sectors.  Once  the  financial  health  of  the  utilities  has\nbeen restored, less Government subsidies will flow into the sector and a higher portion of capital\nexpenditures  for  system  expansion  can  be  generated  by  the  utilities,  also  reducing  the\nrequirement  for  Government  support.  This  in  turn  will  allow  the  Government  to  increase  the\nallocation  of  its  scarce  resources  to  priority  programs  for  poverty  reduction  and  human\ndevelopment.\n\nC.\n\nProgram Risks\n\n117. A continuous drainage from the fiscal budget to KESC will be a significant burden for the\neconomy.  It will deepen the budget deficit and divert public funds from more productive sectors\nin the economy with subsequent adverse impacts on poverty.  Continuous public investment in\nKESC nourishes corruption, adversely affecting the most vulnerable groups of consumers.  As a\nresult  only  two  options  are  available  for  the  Government:  (i)  provide  no  or  limited  electricity\nsupply  in  Karachi,  or  (ii)  restructure  and  privatize  KESC.    Given  the  industrial  base  in  Karachi\nand the importance of electricity for industrial growth, the former option has severe implications\nfor  investments,  economic  activity,  and  employment  generation  with  subsequent  effects  for\neconomic  growth  and  social  unrest.    The  effects  of  social  unrest  are  publicly  severe.    It  will\ndestabilize an already fragile government, which in turn will delay the return to democracy.  A\nlack  of  light  on  the  streets  of  Karachi  would  have  severe  effects  on  security  and  safety,\nespecially  for  women,  and  would  disproportionally  affect  the  low-income  areas  of  Karachi,\nwhere  substitution  possibilities  are  limited.    With  dwindling  investments  in  all  sectors  of  the\neconomy, the prospects for economic recovery and poverty reduction would be dismal.\n\n118. While the risks involved in supporting a strong reform program in the power sector are\nsignificant, they are less than the risks of not supporting such a program. And, several factors\nmitigate  the  risks.  Perhaps  most  important,  the  reform  program  is  both  comprehensive  and\nGovernment  formulated,  and  the  plans  for  its  implementation  have  been  worked  out  by  the\nGovernment  with  due  attention  to  political  realities  and  implementation  capacity.  A  second\nmitigating  factor  is  the  sequencing  of  actions  that  are  already  in  place,  i.e.,  privatization  of\nKESC;  unbundling  of  WAPDA;  and  corporatization,  commercialization,  and  completion  of  the\nprocess of the privatization of at least 4 out of 12 corporatized entities. A third mitigating factor is\nADB\u2019s intense monitoring of the implementation of the reform program along with World  Bank\nand  IMF.  Finally,  adequate  provisions  have  been  made  to  mitigate  risks  relating  to  social\naspects.\n\n119.\nThe risks of not supporting the reform Program are greater than the risk of failure. The\nbenefits  of  the  reforms  to  be  implemented  and  the  financial  crisis  that  might  eventuate  in  the\n\n\f32\n\nIX.     ASSURANCES\n\nabsence of support for the bold actions already commenced by the Government strongly justify\nADB\u2019s involvement in and support for restructuring of the power sector.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following\n\n120.\nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as\ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  will  continue  in\neffect for the duration of the Program Period.\n\nMeasures are being introduced to decrease the levels of theft and T&D losses at\nKESC and WAPDA.  These will be monitored frequently to ensure that losses are\nreduced and the financial status of the two utilities improved.\n\nKESC and WAPDA\u2019s corporatized units will be privatized in a fair, transparent, and\ncompetitive manner and in the time frame agreed upon.\n\nLabor retrenchment, as required, will be carried out in accordance with the laws of\nPakistan  and  the  Government  will  make  the  necessary  funds  available,  as\nrequired, for a voluntary retirement scheme in a timely manner.\n\nPublic  awareness  campaigns  will  be  developed  under  the  TA  loan  and\nimplemented to gain broad-based public support for the reform program.\n\nThe Government will support  consumer advocacy groups through NEPRA and the\nTA loan, to make civil society aware of the operations of the energy sector.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  maintain  its  policy  to  ensure  a  nonuniform  tariff  structure  in\nthe country.\n\nX.

Sector Debt Situation\n\nThe  major  elements  of  the  debt  situation  as  of  June  2000  in  the  sector  are  shown  in\n1.\nFigure  A3.    Because  both  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  and  Karachi\nElectric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)  finance  their  capital  investments  mostly  by  a  substantial\namount of loan credit from the Government, the net total debt of the sector to the governments\n(provincial and federal) amounts to about $2.425 billion (including $304 million of debt to state-\nowned  fuel  suppliers).  This  exceeds  the  Government\u2019s  proposed  national  development\nexpenditure budget for FY2000 of $1.940 billion, i.e., the debt of the sector is 1.25 times of the\nGovernment\u2019s  development  budget.  The  net  indebtedness  of  WAPDA  amounts  to  $1.4  billion\nincluding a contingent liability of $501 million owed to Hub Power Company (HUBCO) and Kot\nAddu Power Company (KAPCO). KESC carries $631 million of net debt. As WAPDA is almost\nsix times KESC in asset size, KESC is financially more burdened than WAPDA. Some debts are\ndisputed, particularly the arrears from the governments to WAPDA and KESC, because the two\nutilities  in  the  past  distributed  inflated  bills  in  order  to  enhance  its  cash  flow.  The  amount\ninvolved, the circular nature of the debt, and the lack of trust between the parties have proved to\nbe  formidable  obstacles  to  resolution  of  the  sector\u2019s  financial  difficulties.  The  Energy  Sector\nRestructuring Program Loan, together with other lending to the sector, is designed to reconcile\nand restructure the various debts to provide a foundation for organizational restructuring.\n\nB.      Receivable Position of KESC and WAPDA\n\nTo  KESC,  the  government  of  Sindh  and  its  local  bodies  owe  almost  PRs2  billion  of\n2.\narrears, whereas the Federal Government paid out its arrears during FY2000 and is current on\nits payment. The Government has committed to have all public sector receivables outstanding\nas of 30 September 2000 paid before the incentive tranche release of the proposed loan. The\nPrivate  sector  accounts  for  83.0  percent  of  KESC\u2019s  arrears,  and  are  a  serious  problem.\nAlthough  KESC  has  recently  improved  its  current  bill  collection  ratio  from  64.0  percent  in\nFY1998  to  75.0  percent  in  FY2000  with  assistance  from  the  army,  collection  from  private\nconsumers  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  KESC  has  committed  to  reduce  net  receivable  (net  of\nprovision  for  bad  debts)  from  5.5  months  of  sales  on  June  2000  to  4.5  months  by  November\n2000  and  3  months  by  June  2003  through  remedial  measures,  including  additional  army\nassistance, rationalization of the billing process, outsourcing to Citibank the work of reconciling\nstatements, improved metering, and strict enforcement of disconnection policy.\n\n3.\nBy  contrast,  for  WAPDA,  public  sector  arrears  have  reached  a  critical  level  while\ncollection  from  private  customers  continues  to  be  good.  The  major  public  sector  defaulters\ninclude AJ&K and the Government of Sindh, which owe 70.0 percent of WAPDA\u2019s public sector\narrears.    On  29  June  2000,  the  Government  decided  that  arrears  from  federal  and  provincial\ngovernments,  FATA,  and  agricultural  tubewell  consumers  of  Balochistan  developed  from  1\nJanuary  1999  to  30  June  2000  should  be  paid  immediately  while  the  arrears  of  Federal\nGovernment,  FATA,  and  agricultural  tubewell  consumers  developed  prior  to  1  January  1999\nshould  be  written  off.  All  the  payments  regarding  this  decision  have  been  made.  However,  a\nsettlement plan of arrears from the Government of Sindh developed prior to January 1999 is still\nbeing  discussed.

While WAPDA is current on its\nfuel  bills,  KESC  has  not  paid  about  PRs7  billion  to  its  gas  and  oil  suppliers,  which  are  public\ncorporations such as  Pakistan  State  Oil and National Refinery Limited. KESC has not paid its\npower  purchase  cost  from  WAPDA  since  March  1999.    KESC  has  also  defaulted  on  its  debt\nservice  obligations  to  the  Government  amounting  to  PRs3.6  billion.  Out  of  WAPDA\u2019s  PRs29.4\nbillion payable to independent power producers, PRs26 billion represents deferred payment to\nHUBCO  and  KAPCO  under  court  order.  WAPDA\u2019s  arrears  to  the  federal  Government  were\nreduced  substantially  in  FY2000  because  PRs36.3  billion  of  its  debt  service  liability  to  the\nGovernment was converted into equity.\n\nTable A3.2: Outstanding Balance of Accounts Payable\n(in PRs million)\nKESC\n\nWAPDA\n\n1999\n\n1999\n\nPayable\nTo\nOil & Gas\nPower Purchase\nFederal Government\nWAPDA\nOthers\n     Total\nKESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority.\na Provisional\nSource: KESC, WAPDA.\n\n2000a\n       6,910       11,447\n       1,147       12,696\n       3,650       37,015\n         0\n       7,960\n       4,124\n 0\n10,823       19,667       65,282\n\n2000a\n       8,879\n     29,433\n       3,349\n0\n       4,095\n     45,756\n\n6,966\n545\n770\n2,542\n0\n\n\fFigure A3: Sector Debt Situation\n(as of June 2000, in $ million)\n\n2,060\n\nFederal Government\n\n680a\n\n204\n\n357\n\nProvincial Government\n\n20\n\n38\n\nWAPDA\n\n153\n\nKESC\n\n171\n\n567b\n\n483\n\nState-Owned Fuel Suppliers\n\nIndependent and other Power\nSuppliers\n\nPrivate Customer\n\n133\n\n22\n\n299\n\nTotal Debt Burden: About $5.2 Billion\n\na  Include foreign loans through the Government\nb  Includes contingent liability of $501 million to HUBCO and KAPCO\n\n5\n5\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n3\n\n \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 4\n\nTARIFF STRUCTURE AFTER MARCH 1999\n\nThe categories and the tariff structure after the adjustments in March 1999, are shown in\n\nCategory\n\nStructure\n\nPRs/kWh\n\nUS Cents/kWh\n\nTable A4: Tariff Categories and Structure\n\n1.\nthe table.\n\nLifeline (2 percent)\nResidential (36 percent)\nIndustrial (38 percent)\n\nBulk Supply (12 percent)\n\nPublic Lighting (3 percent)\nCommercial (9 percent)\n\nAgricultural\n\nSource: KESC and WAPDA.\n\nConsumption up to 50kWh/month\nAverage Residential\n66/132 kV\n(in a 400-volt line)\n11 kV\n(in a 400-volt line)\n400 volts\n11 kV\nAverage\nAverage\n\na.

Higher rates apply\n2.\nto  households  using  more  than  50  kWh  per  month  and  range  from  PRs1.718/kWh  to\nPRs6.811/kWh  with  the  average  tariff  at  PRs3.89/kWh.    The  residential  customers  consume\nabout  38  percent  of  the  total  consumption.  In  the  commercial  sector,  the  average  tariff  is\nPRs7.20/kWh.  The  commercial  consumption  accounts  for  about  9.0  percent  of  the  total\nconsumption. Industry tariffs are divided into four categories (Table A4). Industries consume about\n38.0  percent  of  the  total.  The  tariffs  for  the  bulk  supply  range  between  PRs4.57/kWh\u2013\nPRs4.82/kWh  and  represent  12.0  percent  of  the  total  consumption.  Electricity  used  for  street\nlighting (3.0 percent) is charged at PRs5.88/kWh.\n\n3.\nThe  electricity  tariffs  are  comprised  of  four  parts:  (i)  base  tariffs,  (ii)  fuel  adjustment\ncharges,  (iii)  surcharges,  and  (iv)  additional  surcharges.  The  base  tariff  is  calculated  on  the\nrecovery of the fixed investment costs in generation, transmission, and distribution, in the form of\ndepreciation  and  interest  plus  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  including  a  portion  of  fuel  cost\nand administrative overheads. Base tariffs are applicable to the fixed capacity charge and energy\nuse  charge  in  industrial  and  bulk  supply  consumers,  whereas  only  the  energy  use  charge  is\napplicable  to  residential,  commercial,  and  small  industrial  consumers.  The  fuel  adjustment\ncharges (FAC) were introduced in 1970 to recover the fuel cost in excess of PRs2.24 per million\nBritish thermal unit (BTU). However, after the introduction of a surcharge in January 1992, the fuel\nsubsidy  was  eliminated  and  the  utilities  were  allowed  to  adjust  the  shortfall  in  fuel  cost  against\nrecovery  of  the  same.  The  surcharge  concept  in  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority\n(WAPDA) was introduced for payment of royalties to the provincial government at the rate of 2.5\npercent from 1 January 1992, and gradually increased to the level of 10.4 percent in 1997. The\nobjective  of  the  additional  surcharge  was  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  meet  the  financial\ncovenants.\n\n\fLONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING\n(Pakistan Energy Sector Reforms)\n\nIntermediate Measures\n\nAchievements (1992-1998)\n\nEnergy Sector Reform Targets (2003)\n\nLoans\n\nInvestments\n\nTechnical\nAssistance\n\nEconomic and\nSector Work\n\nPolicies\n\nInstitutions\n\nGood Governance\n\nPrivate Sector\n\nRegional\nCooperation\n\nTransition to\nMarket Economy\n\nADB\nOther Agencies\nPrivate Investment\n\n     $2.1 bn\n     $7.4 bn\n     $3.2 bn\n\nDemand Side Management Study\nSupport for the Government sector\nRestructuring\n\nPower and Water Institutional Study\nManagement Information System Study\nKESC Organization and Restructuring Study\nSplit of WAPDA Water and Power Wings\n\nPrivate Hydro Policy Study\nEnactment of New Private Independent\nPower Policy\nInvestment in 6,500 MW of IPPs\n\nCreation of National Sector Regulator\n(NEPRA)\nUnbundling of WAPDA Power Wing\n\nFacilitation of Pakistan \u2013 India Power Trading\n\nKESC restructuring and privatization study\nPreparation for privatization of KESC\nEstablishment of PEPCO\n\nHuman Resources\n\nGeneration and Coordination Training\n\n1)   Mobilization of ADB resources              $700 m\nMobilization of WB resources                $700 m\n\n2)  No load shedding\n\n3)  No application for new connection pending for more\n\nthan 2 months\n\n4)  Collection to be at least 98% of billing\n\n5) \n\nElimination of tariff cross-subsidy\n\n6)  Work force optimized\n\n7)  Workers compensation package improved\n\n8)  Network to increase peak load handling from\n\n10,000 MW to 15,000 MW\n\n9) \n\nLosses reduced from 25% of input to the grid to\nless than 15%\n\n10)  Average thermal station fuel efficiency to be\n\nincreased to 35%\n\n11)  Commissioning of Ghazi Barotha and Chasma\n\nHydropower projects\n\n12) \n\nImplementation of new private independent power\npolicy\n\n13)  Average reliability increased to at least 95% at MV\n\nlevel\n\n5\n7\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n5\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IPP = Independent Power Producer, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, MV  = megavolt, MW = megawatt, NEPRA = National Electric\nPower Regulatory Authority, PEPCO = Pakistan Electric Power Company, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority, WB = World Bank.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nTHEFT AND LOSS REDUCTION PROGRAM OF KESC AND WAPDA\n\n1.\nA  summary  of  measures  instituted  by  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)  and\nWater  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  to  reduce  theft  and  improve  the  overall\noperational and financial performance are outlined below.\n\nA. \n\nKESC\n\n2.\n\nKESC has introduced the following measures:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi) \n\nInstallation  of  ATMs.    KESC  has  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Citibank  to\ninstall on 1 October 2000 about 30 automated teller machines (ATMs), near KESC\npayment  stations.    The  ATMs  have  been  installed  and  eliminate  some  cash\npayments personnel, who often did not credit payments to the customer\u2019s account.\nThe ATM will increase the integrity of transactions, reduce fraud, provide cash to\nKESC, and decrease customers\u2019 complaints.  For its services, Citibank will receive\nfrom KESC PRs10 per transaction.\n\nCitibank as KESC Collection Agency. Citibank entered into an agreement with\nKESC  to  become  its  collection  agent.    The  Citibank  will  accept  payments  from\nKESC  customers  at  its  branches.    The  arrangement  will  increase  the  integrity  of\nKESC\u2019s collection system, assist customers in the immediate accreditation of the\nbills  paid,  and  reduce  the  customers\u2019  burden  of  record  reconciliation.    The\narrangement has been in effect since 1 October 2000.\n\nCitibank  Data  Management  System.    Another  Citibank  agreement  with  KESC\ninvolves  managing  KESC\u2019s  billing  and  payment  system.  Citibank  will  completely\nreconcile the amount billed by KESC\u2019s billing department and payments received\nat  KESC\u2019s  payment  stations.    The  outsourcing  of  this  function  is  a  major  step  in\navoiding  problems  relating \nthe  collection  of  cash.  The  Citibank  data\nmanagement  control  management  system  has  been  operational  since  1  October\n2000, and will provide credibility to KESC\u2019s billing and collection system. Citibank\nwill receive from KESC PRs2.50 per reconciled payment stub.\n\nto \n\nSubstation  Metering.    KESC  will  install  meters  at  its  substations  to  indicate  the\nexact electricity usage in various areas of its franchise.  The meter reading will be\na  cross  check  to  the  actual  amount  billed  to  the  customers  in  each  area,  will\nprovide  an  accurate  monitoring  system,  and  will  help  ensure  that  the  electricity\nconsumed from a particular substation is accurately billed and the correct amount\ncollected.    Initially,  the  meters  will  be  installed  in  areas  with  high  electricity\nconsumption.\n\nAverage  Billing.  The  current  billing  system  uses  an  average  billing  method  to\nassess the monthly amount to be paid by the customers.  This practice has been\nan  opportunity  source  of  corruption.  Effective  1  October  2000,  KESC  stopped  its\ncurrent widespread practice of average billing.\n\nArmy Involvement.  KESC has recently employed 44 army personnel, mostly for\nintelligence gathering and for management positions.  In addition, 400 soldiers will\nbe  deployed  for  operational  activities  and  to  interact  with  KESC  customers.\nFurthermore,  an  additional  70  army  personnel  could  be  recruited  as  permanent\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nKESC staff at supervisory and management levels, to handle the operational and\nadministrative  functions  of  KESC.    The  involvement  of  the  army  is  well  planned\nand  coordinated,  and  indicates  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  restore  the\noperational and financial viability of KESC.\n\n(vii) \n\nExtension of 11kV  Lines into Interior of Residential and Commercial Areas.\nThis  will  delay  the  errant  consumers  the  opportunity  to  install  hooks  on  to  lines\ndirectly.  Secondly, small capacity transformers and insulated low tension lines will\nbe  used  to  run  the  system  at  rated  capacity  and  reduce  the  possibility  of  illegal\nusage.\n\n(viii)  Metering  Distribution  Transformers.    KESC  has  initiated  a  program  to  install\n\nmeters on all distribution transformers.\n\n(ix) \n\nInstallation  of  Meters  Outside  the  Premises.    Under  this  program,  KESC  has\nstarted to relocate the meters from inside the premises to outside to ensure proper\nconnection of service cable and meters.\n\n(x) \n\nUse of Insulated Cables.  Using insulated 4-core bundled cables to avoid illegal\nconnections.\n\nB. \n\nWAPDA\n\n3.\nSince mid-January 1999, WAPDA has been implementing, with the support of the armed\nforces, an intensive campaign to reduce electricity theft and losses, improve billing and collection,\nand  improve  its  operational  and  financial  performance.  These  efforts  can  be  grouped  in  three\nbroad  areas\u2013theft  and  loss  reduction,  improvements  in  operating  systems  and  procedures,  and\nbilling and collection (including the collection of arrears).\n\n4.\nThe  theft  and  loss  reduction  campaign  is  primarily  focused  on  detection  and  removal  of\nillegal  electricity  connections,  and  checking  of  consumer  meters,  and  is  implemented  by  the\ndistribution companies (DISCOs). On average 4,000-4,500 armed forces personnel are assigned\nto  each  DISCO,  to  support  WAPDA  personnel  (organized  into  15-20  teams  of  inspectors)  in\ninspecting consumer premises, removing illegal connections, and lodging reports with the judicial\nauthorities  in  case  there  is  evidence  of  electricity  theft.  In  addition,  a  chief  executive  officer  for\neach DISCO has been appointed from the army, for a period of two years.\n\n5.\nWAPDA  reported  that  influential  people  (including  ruling  party  politicians  and  other  key\nofficials)  are  being  caught,  and  the  operation  appears  to  be  proceeding  without  political\ninterference.  Since  mid-January  1999,  peak  load  has  declined  by  700-800  MW  in  the  WAPDA\nsystem.  The  normal  (daytime)  load  remained  roughly  constant,  at  about  4,400  MW.  WAPDA\nofficials view this as an early indicator of the success of the theft reduction campaign, as illegal\nconnections are being removed by WAPDA and by consumers, in anticipation of the inspections.\n\nThe  results  of  this  campaign  are  being  documented  and  a  comprehensive  database  on\n6.\nconsumers  and  load  of  each  DISCO  is  being  prepared.    This  will  enable  WAPDA  to  more\nintensively monitor operational performance of each subdivision. Reports on  electricity supplied,\nunits  billed,  and  revenues  collected  for  each  subdivision  are  being  submitted  to  WAPDA\nheadquarters, and are reviewed by senior WAPDA management on a weekly basis. Similarly, a\nsituation report is prepared daily on the activities being undertaken and is submitted to the chief\nexecutive officer of each DISCO.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\n7.\nThe backlog of pending applications is being cleared quickly, and the process for providing\nnew connections has been streamlined. Since one of the main complaints regarding the provision\nof  new  connections  related  to  the  storage  of  meters  available  to  the  DISCOs,  WAPDA  has\nnegotiated  fixed  prices  for  meters  with  a  number  of  local  suppliers,  and  the  customer  can\npurchase the meter directly from those suppliers.\n\n8.\nThe  main  focus  of  the  campaign  to  detect  illegal  connections  and  theft  is  on  domestic,\nindustrial,  and  commercial  consumers.  Checking  the  metering  installations  of  these  consumers\nrequires more technical knowledge and capital investment. While the detections are being made\nand consumer arrears calculated, it is not possible to verify whether the billing records (updated\nmeter reading, new meter number, etc.) are simultaneously being permanently updated. DISCOs\nare  required  to  carefully  check  on  this  aspect,  and  ensure  that  the  billing  records  are  updated\nsimultaneously.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 7, page1\n\n CASH SHORTFALL FINANCING PLAN AND RESTRUCTURING COST\n\nA.\n\nKESC Cash Shortfall Projection\n\n1.\nThe  financial  projections  are  driven  by  efficiency  improvement  measures  committed  by\nthe  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)/the  Government  including:  (i)  change  from\nfurnace  oil  to  gas  fuel, (ii) restoration of generation capacity (iii) reduction in transmission and\ndistribution (T&D) losses, and (iv) improvement in bill collection. No tariff increase is assumed in\nthe projection because further tariff increase can not be justified as the present KESC tariff level\nis  considerably  higher  than  the  international  level.  However,  if  the  National  Electric  Power\nRegulatory Authority (NEPRA) introduces a tariff setting mechanism to automatically reflect cost\nitems such as fuel increases, KESC\u2019s average tariff is likely to be raised.\n\n2.\nChange  from  Furnace  Oil  to  Gas  Fuel.    To  take  advantage  of  the  lower  cost  of\ndomestic gas compared to imported furnace oil, KESC is converting Bin Qasim Thermal Power\nStation to a gas-fired Plant. The technical conversion of its four units has been completed, and\nthe remaining two units will be converted by January 2001. 176 million cubic feet/day of gas is\nrequired to operate all six units. However, due to the limited availability of gas, a full supply of\ngas  is  expected  to  start  on  January  2003.  Until  then,  one  unit  will  be  operated  under  gas  by\nJune 2001 and two units will be operative thereafter.\n\n3.\nRestoration  of  Generation  Capacity.    An  integrated  phased  program  is  in  place  to\nenhance  KESC\u2019s  generating  capacity  from  1,204  MW  to  1,532  MW  by  May  2001.  As  KESC\u2019s\nown  generation  will  increase,  the  resulting  lower  purchase  of  power,  which  is  normally  more\nexpensive than KESC\u2019s own generation, is expected to reduce overall generation cost.\n\n4.\nReduction  in  T&D  Losses.    Based  on  the  present  consumption  data,  KESC\u2019s  T&D\nlosses are documented at 40.8 percent in FY2000. Determination of actual T&D losses is very\ndifficult  because  the  power  theft  has  been  hidden  by  excess  billing.  However,  with  additional\ncollection  by  the  army  and  other  measures  to  reduce  power  theft,  KESC  has  committed  to\nreduce  T&D  losses  by  6.0  percent  in  FY2001,  7.0  percent  in  FY2002  and  6.0  percent    in\nFY2003.\n\n5.\nImprovement  in  Bill  Collection.    KESC\u2019s  Accounts  receivables  as  of  30  June  2000\nwere  PRs18.5  billion,  which  is  equivalent  to  5.5  months  of  its  energy  sales.  Currently,  major\ndefaulters  are  the  provincial  governments  and  private  sector.  Arrears  from  the  government  of\nSindh and its local bodies to KESC were approximately PRs2 billion. As one of the conditions\nfor the first tranche and the incentive tranche release, net receivables have been reduced to 4.5\nmonth  of  sales  by  21  November  2000  and  public  sector  arrears  are  to  be  fully  recovered    31\nJanuary  2001  and.  KESC  has  also  committed  to  further  reduce  its  accounts  receivable  to  4.0\nmonths  of  sales  by  30  June  2001,  3.5  months  by  30  June  2002,  and  3.0  months  by  30  June\n2003.\n\nFinancial Projections.  Based on the above assumptions, the Asian Development Bank\n6.\n(ADB)  prepared  financial  projections  up  to  30  June  2003,  which  were  agreed  to  by  the\nGovernment. A detailed description of KESC\u2019s projected financial performance and the resulting\ncash  shortfall  up  to  privatization  is  provided  in  Table  A7.3.  The  summary  of  the  cash  shortfall\nprojection is given in Table A7.1.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 7, page2\n\nTable A7.1: Cashflow Projection for KESC\n(PRs billion)\n\nItem\n\nCash Collection\nFuel and Power Purchase\nOther Operating Expense\nCapital Expenditure\nDebt Service\nGross Cash Shortfall\nMitigation Measures\nNet Cash Shortfall\n     Cumulative Cash Shortfall\nSource: KESC, ADB.\n\n1998-99\nActual\n22.2\n20.7\n3.3\n1.2\n5.2\n(11.4)\n1.1\n(10.3)\n(10.3)\n\n1999-00\nProvisional\n25.5\n25.9\n2.9\n2.0\n7.8\n(10.1)\n0.4\n(9.6)\n(19.9)\n\n2000-01\nBudget\n32.4\n34.7\n3.5\n3.0\n9.0\n(17.2)\n0\n(17.2)\n(37.1)\n\n2001-02\nProjected\n35.7\n32.0\n3.7\n3.3\n10.6\n(14.1)\n0\n(14.1)\n(51.2)\n\n2002-03\nProjected\n40.9\n34.5\n4.1\n3.1\n10.2\n(10.7)\n0\n(10.7)\n(61.9)\n\n7.\nContinued  efforts  to  recover  arrears  and  reduce  power  theft  are  expected  to  increase\ncash  revenue  by  17.0  percent  per  annum  during  FY2000  to  FY2003,  while  energy  demand  is\nprojected  to  grow  at  5.0  percent  annually  and  no  tariff  increase  is  assumed  in  FY2002  and\nFY2003.  Percentage  of  fuel  and  power  purchase  cost  in  cash  revenue  is  expected  to  further\nincrease  in  FY2001  as  a  result  of  the  recent  hike  of  international  oil  prices.  However,  due  to\nconversion from fuel oil to gas, the fuel and power purchase cost is projected to represent 84.0\npercent of cash revenue in FY2003, while it slightly exceeded cash revenue in FY2000.\n\n8.\nDespite an improvement of the overall cash flow position, KESC\u2019s operational cash flow\nwill  not  cover  its  minimum  capital  investment  requirement  and  debt  service  obligations.  The\ncumulative cash shortfall up to 30 June 2003 is estimated to be PRs61.9 billion. To keep KESC\nsolvent until privatization, this cash shortfall needs to be fully financed.\n\n9.\nIn  ADB\u2019s  base  case,  no  tariff  increase  is  assumed  after  the  most  recent  raise  by  13\npaisa/kWh on 1 November 2000. However, ADB, through the policy matrix, encourages NEPRA\nto introduce a mechanism to automatically adjust in the tariff structure the cost for items such as\nfuel and taxes. If such a tariff setting mechanism is established, the average tariff of KESC will\nlikely be raised by 15.0 percent in FY2001, 8.0 percent in FY2002, and 8.0 percent in FY2003.\nSuch  tariff  increases  would  reduce  KESC\u2019s  cumulative  cash  shortfall  from  PRs61.9  billion  to\nPRs40.3 billion by 30 June 2003.\n\nB. \n\nCash Shortfall Financing Plan\n\nThe  cash  shortfall  of  PRs128.2  billion,  comprising  PRs91.8  billion  for  KESC  and\n10.\nPRs36.4  billion  for  WAPDA,  needs  to  be  financed  to  make  the  power  sector  current  on  its\npayment  obligations  and  to  keep  KESC  and  WAPDA  solvent  until  privatization.  The  cash\nshortfall for WAPDA was fully financed in FY2000 by converting PRs36.4 billion debt-servicing\nliabilities to the Government into equity. KESC\u2019s cumulative cash shortfall of PRs29.9 billion up\nto FY1998 was financed by the Government\u2019s financial restructuring package, approved by the\nCabinet in November 1998.\n\nThe  Government  has  fully  committed  to  finance  KESC\u2019s  cash  shortfall  up  to  30  June\n11.\n2003. The cumulative cash shortfall of PRs37.1 billion up to 30 June 2001 will be financed by (i)\nconversion of unpaid principal and interest to the Government outstanding as of 30 June 2000\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 7, page3\n\ninto equity (PRs8.4 billion); (ii) conversion of overdue liabilities of fuel/power purchase into long-\nterm loan (PRs15.0 billion); (iii) on-lending of the first tranche of the proposed ADB loan (PRs9.0\nbillion);  (iv)  bridge  financing  from  commercial  banks,  guaranteed  by  the  Government  (PRs4.7\nbillion).  The  Government  will  finance  the  cumulative  cash  shortfall  for  1  July  2001  to  30  June\n2003,  by  the  combination  of  budgetary  allocation,  debt-equity  swap,  on-lending  of  the  second\ntranche of the proposed ADB loan, and refinancing of the existing term finance certificate (TFC).\nThe financing plan is detailed in Table A7.2.\n\nTable A7.2: Cash Shortfall Financing Plan\n(PRs billion)\n\nFY98\n\nFY99\n\nFY00\n\nFY01\n\nFY02\n\nFY03\n\nTotal\n\nItem\nCash Shortfall for the Year\n  KESC\n  WAPDA\n          Total\nCash Shortfall Financing\n  Conversion of Government Loan to Equity\n  Conversion of Government Loan to Subdebt\n  Rollover of Government-Guaranteed Loan\n  Netting of Circular Debt\n  New Government-Guaranteed Loan/ ADB Loan\n  TFC, Budgetary Allocation, etc.\n           Total\n\n29.9\n0\n29.9\n\n0\n9.6\n7.4\n1.4\n0\n11.5\n29.9\n\n10.3\n0\n10.3\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n9.6\n36.4\n46.0\n\n36.4b\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n36.4\n\n17.2\n0\n17.2\n\n8.4b\n0\n0\n0\n13.7\n15.0\n37.1\n\n14.1\n0\n14.1\n\n3.8b\n0\n0\n0\n (0.4)c\n10.7\n14.1\n\n10.7\n0\n10.7\n\n3.7b\n0\n0\n0\n0\n7.0\n10.7\n\n0\n\n10.3\n\nNet Cumulative Cash Shortfall\nOther Financial Restructuring of KESCa\n  Conversion of Government  loan to Equity\n  Conversion of Government Subdebt to Equity\nADB = Asian Development Bank,  KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development\nAuthority.\na  No impact on cash flow.\nb  Restructuring cost incurred or to be incurred by the Government.\nc  Including repayment of the GOP guaranteed commercial loan.\nSource: KESC, ADB.\n\n3.0b\n0\n\n0\n9.6b\n\n19.9\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n91.8\n36.4\n128.2\n\n52.3\n9.6\n7.4\n1.4\n13.3\n44.2\n128.2\n\n30.2\n\n3.0\n9.6\n\nC. \n\nRestructuring Cost of the Power Sector\n\nAs  Table  A7.2  shows,  the  Government  has  converted  its  loans  to  KESC  and  WAPDA\n12.\namounting  to  PRs39.4  billion  ($762  million)  into  equity  up  to  FY2000.  Unlike  other  financial\nassistance by the Government, which is primarily in the form of guarantee, this debt write-off is\nconsidered a restructuring cost of the power sector. KESC\u2019s debt obligation of PRs25.5 billion\n($493  million),  which  the  Government  has  committed  to  convert  into  equity  from  FY2001  to\nFY2003,  will  be  an  additional  restructuring  cost  to  be  incurred  by  the  Government.  The\nrestructuring  cost  may  increase  if  further  Government  loans  or  Government-guaranteed  loans\nare written off in the process of privatizing KESC and WAPDA although the cost can be partly\nrecouped by sale proceeds.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\nTable A7.3: KESC Financial Projection (ADB Base Case)\n(PRs million)\n\nItem\n\nOperational Assumptions\nDemand Growth\nT&D Losses\nTariff Increase\nFuel Oil Price Change\n\nIncome Statement Items\nTotal Sales (GWh)\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nNet Income\n\nCash Flow Statement Items\nCash Collection\nRevenue Expenditure\nCapital Expenditure\nWorking Capital Change\nDebt Servicing (Net)\nCash Surplus(Shortfall)\n\nBalance Sheet Items\nAccount Receivable (Net)\nNet Fixed Assets\nTotal Assets\nLong-term Debt\nEquity\n\nFY99\n\nFY00\nActual Provisional\n\nFY01\n\nFY03\nBudget Projected Projected\n\nFY02\n\n3.0%\n38.6%\n9.7%\n-11.5%\n\n7.5%\n40.0%\n4.5%\n51.1%\n\n5.1%\n33.4%\n3.0%\n-9.1%\n\n5.0%\n26.4%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n\n5.0%\n20.4%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n\n       \n     \n      \n      \n\n6,131\n23,781\n(4,323)\n(7,483)\n\n          \n        \n         \n       \n\n6,443\n26,145\n(7,141)\n(12,896)\n\n      \n    \n   \n   \n\n7,534\n31,402\n(11,201)\n(17,244)\n\n       \n     \n      \n      \n\n8,755\n36,421\n(4,059)\n(9,461)\n\n       \n     \n      \n      \n\n9,952\n41,345\n(2,236)\n(6,942)\n\n     \n     \n       \n       \n       \n    \n\n22,246\n24,058\n1,209\n3,145\n5,211\n(11,377)\n\n        \n        \n          \n         \n          \n       \n\n25,521\n28,883\n1,980\n(3,400)\n7,802\n(10,065)\n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n   \n\n32,441\n38,308\n2,970\n(824)\n9,045\n(17,186)\n\n     \n     \n       \n         \n     \n    \n\n35,706\n35,874\n3,296\n(179)\n10,641\n(14,080)\n\n     \n     \n       \n         \n     \n    \n\n40,968\n38,671\n3,109\n(507)\n10,205\n(10,689)\n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n      \n\n11,899\n49,751\n69,610\n53,188\n(8,605)\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n       \n\n11,738\n49,298\n65,837\n51,217\n(21,497)\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n\n10,263\n50,442\n65,415\n47,135\n(38,738)\n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n    \n\n10,435\n50,553\n65,310\n41,672\n(48,194)\n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n    \n\n10,167\n50,331\n64,950\n34,006\n(55,131)\n\nFinancial Ratios\nDebt Service Ratio\nSelf Financing Ratio\nCurrent Ratio\nLong-term Debt as Percentage of\n     Long-term Debt + Equity\nNet Receivables (month)\n\n-0.74\n-281.6%\n0.98\n119.3%\n\n-0.68\n\n-0.55\n\n0.29\n-257.3% -439.9% -310.2% -242.2%\n0.18\n172.3% 561.3% -638.9% -161.0%\n\n-0.01\n\n0.53\n\n0.29\n\n0.22\n\n6.1\n\n5.5\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, T&D = transmission and distribution.\nSource: KESC, ADB.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 8, page 1\n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\nThe entire Karachi area is directly affected by the Government\u2019s restructuring program.\n1.\nThe  current  financial  situation  of  the  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)  leaves  the\nGovernment with only two options: let KESC go bankrupt with no, or limited power supply in the\nKarachi  area;  or  restructure  and  privatize  KESC.  Given  the  industrial  base  in  Karachi  and  the\nimportance  of  the  electricity  supply  for  industrial  growth  and  household  welfare,  the  former\noption  is  not  acceptable.  The  current  corrupt  practices,  and  a  possible  decision  of  the\nGovernment  to  let  KESC  go  bankrupt  would  impact  the  poor  severely.  Keeping  KESC,  as  a\npublic  utility,  afloat  with  Government  resources  is  not  a  sustainable  solution  as  it  nourishes\ncorruption  and  limits  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  invest  in  social  and  more  growth  enhancing\nsectors.\n\n2.\nThis  appendix  is  organized  into  three  sections.  The  overview  of  the  consumer  base  of\nKESC,  presented  in  section  A,  gives  a  picture  of  the  distributional  implications  of  the  current\nsituation. Section B provides an assessment of the direct and indirect impacts on the poor and\nmost  vulnerable  of  the  restructuring  program.  The  overall  macroeconomic  implications  for\npoverty  reduction  of  the  program  is  discussed  in  section  C.  A  summary  table  of  the  expected\nimpacts is provided at the end of this appendix.\n\nA. \n\nOverview\n\nThe  official  electrification  ratio  in  Karachi  is  74.4  percent.  The  remaining  25.6  percent\n3.\ncomprises illegal connections (about 400,000) mainly by poor residential consumers. Table A8.1\npresents a dismal picture of significant underbilling of non-poor and commercial consumers, the\nmain cause of the deficit and cash short-fall for KESC.\n\n4.\nAbout  24.0  percent  of  the  official  consumer  base  of  KESC  are  poor  or  low-income\nhouseholds1. These consumers are billed for nearly 21.0 percent of the total billed units with an\naverage consumption of 170 kWh per month. About 60.0 percent consume less than 100 kWh\nper month. Considering that the average consumption of electricity in Pakistan is 333 kWh per\nmonth,  the  corresponding  figures  for  non-poor  residential  consumers  in  Karachi  seem  low,\nespecially since average consumption is normally higher in urban areas. More than 73.0 percent\nof  commercial  consumers  are  billed  for  less  than  100  kWh  per  month;  although  commercial\nconsumers represent 19.5 percent of the consumer base, they only receive 15.0 percent of the\ntotal billed units.\n\nTable A8.1: Estimated Distribution of KESC Consumer Base\n\nConsumer Category\n\nResidential\n\nCommercial\n\nAll\n\nConnections (%)\nBilled Amounts (%)\nAverage Units Billed (kWh)\nConsumer  Share  Billed  less\n\nthan 100 kWh (%)\n\n Source: KESC.\n\nNon-poor Total\n80.5\n56.6\n84.8\n64.2\n209\n225\n\nPoor\n\n23.9\n20.6\n170\n\n59.7\n\n19.5\n15.2\n154\n\n100.0\n100.0\n198\n\n37.5\n\n45.8\n\n73.4\n\n51.2\n\n                                                          \n1  Estimates of the distribution of the residential consumer base are based on geographical location of households.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment of the Program\n\nGiven  the  lack  of  empirical  data  for  electricity  expenditure  ADB\u2019s  Mission  conducted  a\n5.\nhousehold survey in low-income areas of Karachi to assess the preliminary direct and indirect\nimpacts on the poor.2 In addition, the Mission conducted in-depth discussions with small-scale\nbusinesses  to  assess  consequences  for  economic  activity  directly  affecting  income-earning\nopportunities for the poor. The interviews focused on assessing the effects on the poor in terms\nof  quality  of  supply,  consumer  services,  expenditure  on  electricity,  vulnerability  to  corrupt\npractices, economic activity, and general welfare of households. Based on the outcome of the\nsurvey a technical assistance for a poverty impact assessment was formulated with components\nfor  continued  monitoring  of  the  effects  on  the  poor  during  the  program  implementation  period\nand  capacity  building  to  consumer  participation  in  the  competitive  electricity  market.  The\ncapacity building was formulated with particular relevance to reducing the vulnerability of poor\nconsumers.\n\n6.\nThe  corrupt  practices  and  KESC\u2019s  consequent  cash  short-fall  for  KESC  has  affected\npoor  consumers  more  than  other  consumer  groups.  Whereas  non-poor  residential  and\ncommercial  consumers  area  affected  by  power  cuts  resulting  from  deteriorating  maintenance,\nthese are more frequent and persist for longer time periods in low-income areas of Karachi. In\naddition, non-poor consumers have often invested in generators to overcome the inconvenience\nof  power  cuts.  Due  to  high  initial  capital  costs  this  option  is  not  available  for  poor  consumers.\nThe initial assessment shows that 36.0 percent of the households interviewed suffered from loss\nof income as a result of power cuts. In addition, adverse impacts on general household welfare\nwere  significant,  including  lack  of  sleep,  mosquito  bites,  security  problems,  loss  of  study  time,\nand general inconvenience, especially for children. Poor consumers are especially susceptible\nto  corrupt  practices  in  collection,  billing  and  connection  fees.  The  vulnerability  of  the  poor  is\nreinforced  by  the  fact  that  these  consumers  face  difficulties  in  monitoring  their  own  electricity\nconsumption  due  to  the  irregularity  of  billing,  lack  of  meter  readings  by  KESC  officials,  and\nneglect  in  consumer  services.  The  poor\u2019s  vulnerability  to  extortion  is  exacerbated  by  illiteracy\nand  inability  to  read  their  own  meters.  Corrupt  practices  have  displaced  resources  in  KESC\naway  from  provision  of  legal  connections.  Although  connection  fees  are  difficult  for  poor\nhouseholds  to  pay,  they  prefer  legal  connections  because  they  are  perceived  to  strengthen\nproperty rights. Improvements in the billing system, meter readings, and connection services are\nimportant  tools  for  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  poor  consumers.  However,  to  address  the\ninefficiencies in the billing and distribution departments, initial capital costs are required. KESC\nis trapped in a vicious cycle of low revenue collection and not being able to invest in measures\nthat would improve revenue collection. KESC has not, despite significant resources and efforts,\nbeen able to provide poor consumers with a fair share of benefits of the electricity sector.\n\n7.\nThe key to addressing the vulnerability of poor consumers is to restore long-run financial\nviability of the electricity sector through restructuring and privatization, laying the foundation for\na  competitive  and  (thus),  cost  effective  electricity  market.  Although  KESC\u2019s  acute  financial\nsituation will primarily be solved by reducing theft, some tariff increases reflecting cost recovery\nmay be expected in the short run. However, in the longer run increased competition will lead to\nefficiency  gains  and  ultimately  result  in  lower  tariffs.  The  current  average  expenditure  on\nelectricity among poor residential consumers is about 10.0 percent of cash income, well above\n\n                                                          \n2  In these areas, KESC had recently replaced illegal connections with legal ones.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\ninternational  comparisons.3  To  eliminate  the  adverse  impact  of  tariff  increases  on  poor\nconsumers, the lifeline tariff will be maintained.\n\nC. \n\nMacroeconomic Impacts of the Program\n\n8.\nThe macroeconomic impact of the program is pro-poor and has significant implications\nfor government spending on social sectors and public allocation of investments and the resulting\neffect on overall economic growth. KESC\u2019s current financial situation has diverted public funds\naway  from  social  expenditures  and  other  sectors  that  enhance  economic  growth  that  would\nbenefit the poor. For instance, the cash short-fall in KESC for the fiscal year (FY) 2000 is nearly\nequal  to  Government  expenditure  on  social  services:  more  than  1.7  times  the  expenditure  on\neducation  or  5.0  times  the  expenditure  on  health.  Although  these  funds  may  not  be  fully\nfungible,  allocation  of  funds  to  KESC  has  implications  for  the  budget  deficit  and  the  options\navailable for the Government. The KESC cash short-fall for FY2000 amounts to 5.2 percent of\nthe fiscal deficit and is projected to increase to 7.2 percent for FY2001. Given Pakistan\u2019s overall\nfiscal  deficit  (5.8  percent  of  gross  domestic  product)  the  Government  has  limited  resources  to\nkeep KESC afloat. The fiscal deficit can primarily be financed through increasing money supply\nor by domestic and international borrowing. Printing money causes inflation, the burden of which\nfalls disproportionally on the poor. Borrowing crowds out private (and other public) investment,\ncrucial  for  economic  growth  and  employment  generation.  Privatization  of  KESC  and  restoring\nfinancial  health  in  the  energy  sector  will  reduce  the  burden  on  the  Government  deficit  and\ninduce a more efficient allocation of resources for the economy as a whole.\n\n                                                          \n3  Electricity expenditure for low-income groups is usually 3.0-6.0 percent of income. The unusually high figures for\n\nKarachi is most likely due to over-billing of poor consumers.\n\n\fTable A8.2: Summary of Expected Impacts of the Energy Sector\nRestructuring Program\nIndirect\n\nDirect\n\nChannel\nLabor\n\nPrices\n\n\u2022  Short run: higher prices\n\nfor all consumer\ncategories except the\npoorest, who will gain\nfrom elimination of\nover-billing\n\n\u2022  Medium-long run: lower\nprices as a result of\nefficiency gains\n\nAccess to\nelectricity\n\nTransfers\n\n\u2022 \n\nIncreased\n\n\u2022  Lifeline tariffs\n\n68\n\nAppendix 8, page 4\n\n\u2022  Increased\neconomic\nopportunities and\nincreased\nproductivity\n\nMacro\n\u2022  Increased\n\neconomic activity,\njob opportunities,\nand productivity\n\n\u2022  Small indirect\nimpact of tariff\nincreases on goods\nand services\n\n\u2022  Increased costs\n\nto industry due to\nappropriate billing\npractices\n\nNon-poor\n\u2022  Short-term contraction\nof unskilled and semi-\nskilled labor in KESC\nbut increased long run\nemployment\ngeneration\n\n\u2022  Increased expenditure\ndue to appropriate\nbilling practices\n\n\u2022  Small indirect\n\nimpact of lower\ninput costs\n\n\u2022  More efficient\nallocation of\ninputs due to\ncorrection of\nrelative prices\n\n\u2022  Maintained\n\n\u2022  Reduced drain of\nGovernment\nresources\n\n\u2022  Reduced budget\n\ndeficit\n\n\u2022  Reduced inflation\n\npressure of\ngovernment\ndeficit financing\n\n\u2022  Reduced\n\ncrowding out\neffects on\ninvestments\n\nNet impact\n\nAssumptions\n\nNarrative\n\nSource: KESC.\n\nDirect pro-poor: better access, reduced expenditure on electricity, reduced vulnerability, and increased\nincome earning opportunities\nIndirect pro-poor: Reduction of government deficit may allow increased allocations to social sectors\n\nDirect impacts:\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nimproved billing and collection practices to eliminate corrupt practices\nimproved meter readings\nfinancial health to improve maintenance and ability to extend services\nelimination of theft is efficiently targeted\nlifeline tariffs maintained and well targeted\ncapacity building of consumer groups to represent poor consumers\ncompetition is introduced for efficiency gains\n\nIndirect and macro impacts:\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nlifeline tariffs not to be financed through government budget\nbudget savings from the program are largely fungible, with increased allocations to social and other\nsectors crucial for growth and poverty reduction and/or reduced deficit\n\nFor  low-income  households  consuming  more  than  50  kWh,  the  expected  impact  of  a  tariff  increase  is\nneutral.
