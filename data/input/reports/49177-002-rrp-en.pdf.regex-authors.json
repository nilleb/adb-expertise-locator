THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Power Distribution Modernization Project. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building of Electricidade \nde Timor-Leste in Distribution Network Operation and Maintenance, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will (i) modernize the power distribution system in rural and urban areas in 12 \nmunicipalities  across  Timor-Leste,  and  (ii)  provide  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding to Electricidade de Timor-Leste (EDTL).1 The project will contribute to the sustainability, \nresilience, and reliability of the electricity system by (i) installing electricity metering infrastructure, \n(ii)  rehabilitating  degraded  sections  of  the  distribution  network,  (iii)  installing  a  distribution \nautomation  system  (DAS)  and  a  distribution  management  information  system  (DMIS),  and            \n(iv) building institutional capacity of EDTL. The attached TA will support the implementation of the \nproject, strengthen the corporatization process of EDTL, and provide policy and technical advice \nto EDTL. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic  context\u2014declining  economic  output.  Developing  a  sustainable \neconomy not heavily dependent on petroleum remains a key challenge for Timor-Leste.2 The \neconomy contracted by 7.9% in 2020, due to the state-of-emergency measures to contain the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the 8-month delay in approval of the state budget. This is Timor-Leste\u2019s \nthird annual contraction since 2017\u2014to its lowest point since 2009, after a modest expansion of \n1.8% in 2019.3 Growth is expected to return at 3.4% in 2021 with the government\u2019s ambitious set \nof economic policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic.4 \n \n4.  Energy as a driver of inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. If the country \nis to diversify its revenue base beyond oil, continued investment in electricity system is crucial to \nsupport the growth of industry, trade, and tourism, as well as rural and urban social development. \nTo make electricity supply more reliable, the government aims to update and improve the \nelectricity distribution system. \n \n5.  High cost of electricity burdening fiscal resources. EDTL, a state-owned electric utility, \nhas primary responsibility for providing electricity to more than 200,000 households across Timor-\nLeste. Two power plants\u2014the 119.5-megawatt (MW) Hera Diesel Power Plant and the 136.6 MW \n \n1  Timor-Leste comprises 13 municipalities. The project will cover 12 (Aileu, Ainaro, Baucau, Bobonaro, Covalima, Dili, \nErmera, Lautem, Liquica, Manatuto, Manufahi, and Viqueque) but not Oecusse. \n2  Timor-Leste\u2019s economy depends heavily on oil and gas. According to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative \n2018 Report, oil and gas provided more than 90% of the country\u2019s revenue. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2021.

Dili. \nThe economic recovery plan includes measures to increase the use of renewable, sustainable, and alternative \nenergy. \n \n ", "2 \nBetano Diesel Power Plant\u2014supply all of the country\u2019s electricity.5 Even though consumer tariffs \nare higher than those of its regional peers, electricity supply has been a significant burden on \npublic resources since the formation of the independent country in 1999 due to a combination of \nfactors: (i) heavy dependence on diesel generation using expensive imported fuel, costing $68.8 \nmillion in 2019, with the 2020 diesel import bill budgeted at $109.0 million;6 (ii) high technical \nlosses because of an aging network and outdated technology in the main load center of Dili; (iii) \nwasteful use of energy by residential consumers because of a lack of metering; and (iv) a low \ntariff collection rate for delivered electricity. \n \n6.  Poor quality of distribution. Grid electricity access increased from 21% of the population \nin 2003 to about 80% in 2020. However, the distribution network is in poor condition, suffering \nexcessive voltage drops and persistent service outages. A lack of automated fault isolation and \ninadequate protection measures for medium-voltage distribution can cause extended blackouts \nacross the entire network, which affect large numbers of customers and threaten public safety. \n \n7.  Power  services  need to  be  managed  by  an  autonomous  public  entity.  As the \ngovernment subsidizes about 85% of electricity operating expenses, costing it more than $100 \nmillion annually, improving the financial sustainability of EDTL is critical.7 To reduce the fiscal \nburden on the government at a time when its balance sheet is under pressure to finance economic \nstimulus in response to COVID-19, EDTL needs to reduce generation and supply costs, improve \nrevenue collection, and strengthen its institutional capacity.8 The government has initiated energy \nsector institutional reform, aiming to achieve self-sustainability and improve governance and \ntransparency. The project supports the government\u2019s sector reform agenda by strengthening the \ntransition of EDTL into an autonomous state-owned enterprise (SOE).9 Project outputs and the \nattached TA will help EDTL develop new governance and operational arrangements and improve \nits financial sustainability, as well as provide policy advice to strengthen institutional reform. The \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is consistent with the government\u2019s efforts to make \nSOEs sustainable, transparent, and accountable. \n \n8.  Relevance of the project amid a pandemic and a disaster. While the electricity \ndistribution system always needed strengthening, such need became acute in 2020 because of \nthe  economic  shocks  induced  by  COVID-19. Moreover,  in  April  2021,  amid the  pandemic \nlockdown in Dili, Timor-Leste was hit by torrential rains from Tropical Cyclone Seroja, and flooding \nleft more than 10,000 people homeless, roads impassable, and electricity blackouts widespread.10 \nReliable electricity supply will be critical to support essential services such as health care, food \nproduction and supply, and the construction industry as the country rebuilds, as well as to enable \nwork-from-home and online schooling. Modernizing the power distribution system will (i) reduce \ndistribution losses, thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas \nemissions and pollutants; (ii) improve EDTL\u2019s long-term financial sustainability by making revenue \ncollection more efficient; (iii) improve the reliability and quality of electricity provision for about \n200,000 customers in the country; (iv) minimize the collection and use of fuel for food preparation, \nthereby curtailing household drudgery; (v) enhance economic productivity to support private \nsector development; and (vi) contribute to developing a livable and disaster-resilient city. Access \n \n5  Timor-Leste\u2019s peak load was 85 MW in March 2020. \n6  ADB calculations based on government data and EDTL revenue data from November 2020. ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership is in advanced discussions with the government to act as a transaction advisor for a competitive \ntender to construct a solar photovoltaic power plant of up to 100 MW.  \n7 The annual budget support to EDTL represents about 6% of Timor-Leste 2020 GDP. \n8  World Bank. 2020.

Under enabling conditions, women, \nparticularly heads of vulnerable households, can use energy to boost their livelihoods and living \nstandards. \n \n9.  ADB cross-sector experience and lessons learned. ADB has provided nearly $450 \nmillion in loans, grants, and TA to infrastructure development in Timor-Leste, mostly concentrated \nin the transport sector. The key lessons and experience incorporated in the proposed project from \nthe transport sector in Timor-Leste and ADB\u2019s energy operations in Nusa Tenggara which is \ncontiguous to the proposed project area, include (i) the development of a flexible and adaptive \nproject  design,  accounting  for  the  country\u2019s  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situation  status,                    \n(ii) additional support for the advance procurement of project components to mitigate potential \nimplementation delays, (iii) project implementation support to proactively identify and address \npotential issues due to weak institutional capacity, and (iv) targeted assistance to develop \neffective operation and maintenance (O&M) programs to ensure the long term sustainability of \nthe expected project benefits. \n \n10.  Alignment  with  ADB  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  will  help  achieve  five \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).11 The project supports the following \npriorities under ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Timor-Leste, 2016\u20132020 and the proposed \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Timor-Leste,  2023-2027:12  (i)  improving  the  coverage  and \nreliability of electricity services, (ii) reducing net subsidies for infrastructure O&M, (iii) climate \nproofing new and existing infrastructure, and (iv) mainstreaming gender equality. The project is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Timor-Leste, 2021\u2013202313 and aligns with \nthe promotion of capacity building under ADB\u2019s Energy Policy 2009.14 The project is consistent \nwith the recommendation of the recent ADB sector-wide evaluation of the ADB Energy Policy and \nProgram with respect to improving assistance to the power distribution sector with policy reforms \nand innovations.15 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Project Contributions \nAccelerating progress in gender equality  Women\u2019s access to infrastructure and services will be \nimproved, empowering women economically and \nelevating gender equality in decision-making and \nleadership. \nTackling climate change, building climate  Reducing distribution technical losses will lower harmful \nand disaster resilience, and encouraging  carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution.

The project is aligned with the following impact: access to reliable electricity supply \nenhanced.16 The project will have the following outcome: power supply reliability and financial \nperformance of EDTL improved.17 \n \n12.  Output 1: Service delivery to end users strengthened. To reduce the pervasive \nproblem of high commercial losses and make revenue collection more efficient, the project will   \n(i) upgrade and install 140,000 smart meters, of which at least 10% will be in households headed \nby women, required to better manage electricity consumption and monitor household electricity \nexpenditure;18 (ii) distribute 138,800 smart cards to recharge prepaid meters, providing access to \nat least 416,400 female household members;19 and (iii) install 15 vending kiosks for smart card \nrecharging, of which at least 50% will be owned by women.20 \n \n13.  To improve distribution network operation and reliability and reduce technical losses, the \nproject  will  (i)  install  a  DAS  and  upgrade  distribution  automation  equipment,  (ii)  install  25 \ndistribution transformers to reduce overloading, (iii) install 60 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 20-\nkilovolt (kV) interconnection lines, (iv) construct a distribution control center building and install \ncontrol center equipment, and (v) rehabilitate the main distribution warehouse in Dili. \n \n14.  The DMIS will improve EDTL\u2019s asset management and maintenance programs to support \nthe sustainable operation of the distribution network. The project will (i) procure and install a \ngeographic information system, customer information system, and facility management system, \nall integrated with the DAS; and (ii) collect network and disaggregated consumer data with \nlocation and mapping of the entire distribution network: 20 kV lines, distribution transformers, \nswitchgear, 0.4 kV lines, and consumers. \n \n \n16 Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

It is likely that saving money by decreasing monthly expenditure on electricity and ensuring the \nsafe use of electricity will reduce financial burdens on women. The vending kiosks will be located in the regional \noffices and Dili. \n \n ", "5 \n15.  Output 2: Distribution network upgraded and regional offices constructed and/or \nrehabilitated to green standards. Under this output, the project will (i) install and upgrade 175 \ncct-km  of  20  kV  distribution  lines;  (ii)  install  10  distribution  transformers  with  low-voltage \nswitchgear; (iii) upgrade 75 low-voltage switchgears in distribution transformers; (iv) install and \nupgrade 230 cct-km of low-voltage 0.4 kV distribution lines; (v) replace 34,500 outdated service \nconnections; and (vi) construct or rehabilitate 12 regional EDTL offices to green building standard \nand with gender-sensitive design features. The project will promote women\u2019s participation in \nnontraditional trades by ensuring that at least 20% of skilled and unskilled laborers hired are \nwomen. \n \n16.  Output 3: Institutional and community capacity for electrical safety and operations \nstrengthened. Since the project management unit (PMU) is new, the tasks of the project \nsupervision consultant (PSC) will include a high proportion of capacity building and training for \nEDTL staff, with at least 30% participation by women, in distribution loss reduction, DAS, DMIS \nprocurement, engineering design, project implementation, safeguard management, and power \nsystem planning. The PSC will help EDTL develop guidelines and O&M manuals for the DAS and \nthe DMIS and update power transmission and distribution grid codes. EDTL, with support from \nthe PSC, will provide training sessions to community participants on the safe and productive uses \nof electricity, ensuring that at least 50% of participants are women. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  The Government of Timor-Leste initiated a number of ambitious institutional electricity \nsector reforms in 2020 to (i) expand and modernize the national power system; (ii) improve the \npublic service provision of electricity; (iii) increase the standards of quality and the level of \nreliability at accessible prices; and (iv) improve the viability, governance, and sustainability of the \nsector.  The  project  will  be  Timor-Leste\u2019s  first  energy  project  financed  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners. ADB is providing TA to support institutional reforms in the electricity sector \nby providing capacity building to strengthen the corporatization transition of EDTL.21 The Republic \nof Korea is providing TA to EDTL through a knowledge-sharing program to build capacity in              \n(i) distribution loss reduction, (ii) engineering design of distribution networks, (iii) distribution \nsystem management, and (iv) technical guidelines. The project will support these reforms and \nadd considerable value by (i) establishing the first dedicated energy sector PMU to build capacity \nfor ADB and other development partner energy projects; (ii) helping EDTL develop environmental, \nsocial, and gender management systems applicable to all its operations, as well as providing \nsafeguard training and support to strengthen EDTL\u2019s implementation, supervision, and monitoring \ncapacity; (iii) improving the financial sustainability and management of the electricity sector \nthrough a financial management action plan and a corporatization and financial sustainability plan; \nand (iv) improving the sustainable management of O&M programs by establishing appropriate \nsystems. Essential infrastructure is a prerequisite to develop Timor-Leste\u2019s growth sectors of \nagriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The project will complement ADB\u2019s assistance in the \ntransport and water sectors to improve essential infrastructure and connectivity, create jobs, and \nsupport the government\u2019s COVID-19 economic recovery plan (footnote 4). \n \nD.

The PMU will oversee project \nmonitoring and reporting, safeguard compliance, and project management, and will assist the \nNational Procurement Commission (NPC) in preparing bidding documents for the rehabilitation of \nthe distribution network and regional offices.24 Procurement will be undertaken following the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 4 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 22).  \n \n23.  The impact of COVID-19 is evolving, and the project will be responsive and flexible to \nmeet emerging needs and abide by new guidance. The project will strictly follow government \nguidance on working safely under COVID-19 conditions, adhering to medical and scientific advice. \nContractors will be required to incorporate emerging international construction best practice on \nsocial distancing where possible for works of this nature, implementation methodologies, the \neffective use of forced air ventilation systems, and personal protective equipment. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2021\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Council for Administration of the Infrastructure Fund \n  Minister of Planning and Territory (chair) \n  Minister of Public Works (member) \n  Minister of Finance (member) \n  Minister of Transport and Communications (member) \n(ii)  Implementing agency  Ministry of Public Works \n(iii) Implementing unit  Electricidade de Timor-Leste \nProcurementa  OCB (internationally  4 contracts  $26.76 million \nadvertised) \nConsulting services  QCBS, FTP  110 person-months  $2.77 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting has been identified for project supervision \nconsultant and smart metering packages. \nDisbursement  Disbursement of the loan proceeds will follow ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed between the government and \nADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FTP = full technical proposal, OCB = open competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection. \na  The details are in the Procurement Plan in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n24.  The  attached  TA,  Capacity  Building  of  Electricidade  de  Timor-Leste  in  Distribution \nNetwork Operation and Maintenance, will support three outputs: (i) implementation of the project; \n(ii)  strengthening  of  EDTL\u2019s  corporatization  process;  and  (iii)  building  EDTL  capacity  for \nregulation, maintenance planning, network operation, safeguards, and financial management.25 \n \n24 The NPC manages procurement for contracts worth at least $1 million for civil works, $250,000 for goods and related \nservices, and $200,000 for consulting services. \n25 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nThe TA is estimated to cost $775,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of data acquisition, counterpart staff, office space and communication facilities, \nand other in-kind contributions.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The project was assessed as technically viable with low technical risk. Best-in-class off-\nthe-shelf technology will be deployed for smart metering and rehabilitation of the distribution \nnetwork, including the installation of network protection, construction of a dispatch center for \ndistribution, and installation of a DAS and a DMIS. EDTL has more than a decade of experience \nmanaging the distribution system. Several international manufacturers are capable of supplying \nmetering infrastructure, DAS, and DMIS of the required quality and reliability. The sections of the \ndistribution  network  for  rehabilitation,  location  of  the  automation  switchgear,  and  20  kV \ninterconnection lines will be selected based on additional site surveys and technical studies, which \nwill be completed when international consultants are mobilized. Vendors and the PSC will provide \ntraining and guidance on the DAS and the DMIS. Manuals and processes will be developed by \nthe PSC to support sustainable O&M of project facilities. Climate change risk to the project is \nassessed to be medium as the project area experiences monsoons, rising sea levels, landslides, \nand flooding (footnote 10). Detailed project design has incorporated elements to mitigate these \nrisks, including sectionalization and protection of the distribution system. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.26 A with- and without-project framework was \nadopted, and the economic internal rate of return was measured against an assumed hurdle rate \nof 9.0%. The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 11.8%. \nEconomic benefits are derived from reduced electricity consumption through loss reduction and \nless  frequent  outages.  Sensitivity  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  expected  economic \nperformance is robust. \n \n27.  The project is financially viable, with a financial internal rate of return of 28.7%, which is \nconsiderably higher than the 4.7% weighted average real cost of capital. Sensitivity analysis was \nconducted to account for potential variation in financial viability. The financial viability of the project \nis robust, as the financial internal rate of return exceeded the weighted average cost of capital \nunder all scenarios.27 \n \n   \n \n26 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n27 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  EDTL will face several financial and operational sustainability challenges as it transitions \nfrom an MPW department into an efficient, commercial public utility corporation. To support the \ntransition, ADB will provide an attached TA (para. 24) and the PSC will strengthen the financial \nmanagement capacity of EDTL to improve its long-term financial sustainability. The project is \nassessed as financially viable and is expected to generate strong positive cash flows to support \nongoing capital investment, service project debt, and finance O&M expenditure. The project will, \ntherefore,  strengthen  EDTL\u2019s  long-term  financial  sustainability.  Project  design  incorporates \nadaptation measures to lessen the identified climate vulnerability and will mitigate climate change \nover the life of the assets created under the project (footnote 22). \n \nD.  Governance \n   \n29.  The financial management risk before mitigation is assessed as high because of the \nuncertainties created during EDTL\u2019s transition into an SOE from an MPW department and the \nneed to establish new financial management systems and controls. EDTL is establishing new \nbusiness processes, with support from an ongoing ADB TA (footnote 21), which will strengthen \nEDTL\u2019s procurement, governance framework, financial management, internal audit function, and \ncontract management capacity. EDTL will benefit from support provided by the PSC during project \nimplementation. The attached TA will help the government improve the performance of the energy \nsector through technical support, policy advice, and capacity development. ADB will closely \nmonitor EDTL\u2019s corporatization road map and the quarterly reports from EDTL on business plan \nprogress. \n \n30.  The NPC is responsible for procuring works worth at least $1 million, goods at least \n$250,000, and consultancy services at least $200,000 in accordance with Decree Law No. \n14/2011. The MPW and EDTL will undertake procurement below these thresholds. The NPC has \nexperience  procuring  for  projects  financed  by  ADB,  other  development  partners,  and  the \ngovernment but has limited experience in energy projects. ADB carried out strategic procurement \nplanning to ensure that procurement approaches fit for purpose are developed to maximize value \nfor money, given capacity constraints of the NPC, MPW, EDTL, and the government. Project \nconsultants will assist the MPW, EDTL, and NPC in pre-procurement and procurement activities. \nContracts are packaged to consider market competitiveness and supplier and/or contractor \ninterest, especially for technology procurement, notably smart meters and the DAS. \n \n31.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence on EDTL and the members of its  executive \ncommittee and board of directors.28 They do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially \nsignificant integrity risk. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that EDTL was not established, \nand is not being used, for money laundering or terrorism financing. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, Ministry of Finance, MPW, and EDTL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Poverty and social.

More reliable electric power is expected to support increased economic \nactivity to benefit large industries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and community facilities \nsuch as clinics and schools, with possible indirect benefit from jobs created for local people. \nUpgrading  the  distribution  system  expedites  rural  electrification,  which  improves  the  rural \neconomy. \n \n34.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project will \nincrease women\u2019s access to, participation in, and benefit from improved electricity delivery by \n(i) upgrading electricity meters to better manage electricity consumption and monitor electricity \nexpenditure of at least 14,000 households headed by women; (ii) providing about 416,400 \nfemales with access to smart cards (footnote 19); (iii) establishing 15 new prepaid rechargeable \ncard vending kiosks, of which at least 50% will be owned by women; (iv) ensuring that project \nconstruction provides at least 20% of its jobs to women and gender-sensitive design features that \nmeet the needs of women on-the-job; (v) delivering technical training to female EDTL staff; and \n(vi) strengthening community knowledge and understanding of good energy practices, including \nat least 50% participation by women in each village in community training sessions on electrical \nsafety and productive uses of electricity. The project will be supported by a gender action plan. 29 \nThe PMU and PSC will hire a social and gender specialist and commit at least 25% of PMU staff \npositions to women. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The project will not cause significant negative environmental \nimpacts, and any potential negative environmental impacts are small scale and localized and can \nbe mitigated through appropriate measures. Based on a screening of project components and \nactivities, the project is classified as category B for the environment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). No components will traverse environmentally or culturally \nsensitive areas. Climate risk screening identified that the project is at risk of flooding, sea-level \nrise, and landslides. Appropriate adaptation measures will be incorporated into the detailed \nengineering design of the distribution lines, the distribution control center building and warehouse, \nand regional offices. An initial environmental examination and an environmental management \nplan  prepared  for  the  project  detail  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  activities,  reporting \nrequirements, and institutional responsibilities on environment safeguards.31 The environmental \nmanagement plan will be included in bid documents and contract requirements. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  Resettlement  due  diligence  found  no  land \nacquisition required by the project. The resettlement due diligence report will be updated following \ndetailed engineering design of the rehabilitation of the distribution network. If land must be \nacquired from private individuals and/or households for any construction and/or rehabilitation \nwork, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and submitted to the government and ADB for review and approval.
