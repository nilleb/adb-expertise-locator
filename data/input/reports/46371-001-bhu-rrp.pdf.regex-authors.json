I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  and  grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Strengthening  Economic \nManagement Program.1 \n \n2.   The program will pursue policy reforms through budget support for the Government of \nBhutan, which currently faces weakening growth prospects and challenges in macroeconomic \nmanagement.  The  program  will  strengthen  macro-financial  management  in  the  country  to \nensure adequate and sound development financing that is balanced and without distortions. \nThis is necessary to sustain robust growth in the medium-term and facilitate Bhutan\u2019s transition \nto a middle-income country. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. Bhutan has successfully pursued investment-led growth that builds on its \ncomparative  advantage  and  improves  socioeconomic  development.  Despite  the  impressive \ngrowth in income per capita and progress toward Millennium Development Goals over the past \nyears, there has been increasing evidence of an overheating economy. This has been reflected \nin the buildup of domestic and external imbalances and resulting in the recent rupee liquidity \nshortage.2  \n \n4.  The  program  targets  corrective  policy  measures  to  address  these  imbalances  and \nimprove macroeconomic management. The program will assist in transitioning the economy on \nto a sustainable growth track over the medium-term to avoid what could otherwise be a hard \nlanding.  \n \n5.  The next 3\u20135 years will be critical as 10 ongoing and forthcoming hydropower projects \nundergo construction (para. 29). The critical challenge for the government is to ensure the \ntimely completion of such projects in order to develop a sufficiently large generation of export \nearnings that will sustain the financing through the budget of an increasing demand for public \nservices. Strong macroeconomic management will be imperative to sustain the large investment \ndrive required to complete these projects and attract additional private investment.  \n \n6.  Driver of growth. Bhutan\u2019s economy performed well during FY2001\u20132011, with gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth averaging 8% per annum. Accordingly, per capita income, \nmeasured in 2,000 constant dollars, has trebled to $2,428 in 2011 from $778.30 in 2001. These \nadvances were driven mainly by the hydropower sector, which is the  engine of  economic \ngrowth.3 Hydropower contributes a quarter of Bhutan\u2019s GDP and is the main source of public \nrevenue.  \n \n7.  To sustain Bhutan\u2019s high economic growth trajectory and to meet its Vision 2020 goals, \nthree elements are deemed critical: (i) sound macroeconomic management; (ii) efficient, reliable, \nand  expanding  physical  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  a  strong  domestic  revenue  base.  The \ngovernment has therefore prioritized, in addition to constructing hydropower projects, improving \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In this report, \u201crupee\u201d refers to Indian rupees. \n3  As part of Vision 2020, the government plans to add 10,000 megawatts of power generating capacity by 2020. To \nthis end, the government entered into a bilateral agreement with  the Government of India during the first \nEmpowered Joint Group Meeting held in Delhi in March 2009 to develop 10 hydropower projects.   \n ", "2  \nand  expanding  hard  and  soft  infrastructure,  including  through  investment  in  health  and \neducation under the Tenth Five-Year Development Plan.4  \n \n8.  Financing of growth. This ambitious buildup of public capital expenditure, especially on \nhydropower projects, has been financed largely by external development assistance. Following \non the introduction of the banking system in Bhutan in the 1970s, despite increasing income per \ncapita, the household savings and overall savings in the national economy remained relatively \nlow. In addition, the banking system has largely been shielded from competition, and savings \nproducts  in  the  financial  system  are  largely  undeveloped,  further  inhibiting  savings  in  the \neconomy. \n \n9.  India has been Bhutan\u2019s single largest bilateral and trading partner, providing 75% of its \nimports and absorbing 90% of its exports. Recently, India\u2019s share of development expenditure in \nBhutan has declined. More generally, with the rise in Bhutan\u2019s income per capita and overall \ndevelopment,  concessional  terms  of  assistance  from  other  development  partners  have \nhardened.  \n \n10.  The transition from an agrarian to a modern economy has increased demands on the \ngovernment, particularly regarding service delivery and social sector expenditures. This has \nrapidly expanded public spending in the budget, which has intensified fiscal pressures and built \nup national debt. While there has been a steady growth of tax revenue, the additional revenue \ngenerated from hydropower exports  has not fully met rising demand for services provided \nthrough the budget and debt servicing obligations.  \n \n11.  Economic imbalances. Higher household income has also contributed to robust growth \nin private consumption, which, together with large public spending has led to an increase in \nimports and widening of the trade deficit with India. On the financial side, the added pressure on \nconsumption has more recently led to the rapid expansion in growth of financial sector credit in \nthe economy which has been outpacing nominal GDP growth rate.5 While inflation has been \nrecently increasing, the resulting pressure has been most clearly manifested in a rupee liquidity \ncrunch in the local economy. \n \n12.  Consequently, in FY2012, a fiscal deficit of 4.7% of GDP erased a fiscal surplus of 1.6% \nin FY2011 and the current account deficit widened to 20.6% of GDP from 10% in FY2011. While \nthe balance of payments remains in surplus, the net rupee balance in the Royal Monetary \nAuthority (RMA), the central bank, has been steadily declining over the past few years, standing \nat  \u2013Rs9.6  billion  ($173.6  million)  as  of  early  June  2012.  Widening  domestic  and  external \nimbalances,  coupled  with  rising  inflation  and  the  rupee  liquidity  squeeze,  pose  complex \nmacroeconomic  management  challenges  for  the  government  and  are  clear  symptoms  of \nstructural challenges in the economy that need to be addressed. \n \n13.   Government reform. Recognizing the seriousness of the issue, the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) and the RMA have worked together to address the rupee liquidity crunch and depleted \nrupee reserves toward improving macro-financial stability.6 The government has adopted three \ncritical  measures to  strengthen  stewardship  of  the  economy.  First, the  RMA  has  correctly \nclarified that the rupee anchors the nominal value of the ngultrum but that there should be no \npresumption  of  unlimited  convertibility.  The  dissemination  of  this  important  fact  should  be \ncontinued.  Second,  RMA  made  it  mandatory  to  use  banking  channels  to  settle  rupee \n                                                \n4  The Tenth Five-Year Development Plan period covers FY2009\u2013FY2013. \n5  The nominal GDP growth rate was 17.2% in FY2007 and 18.0% in FY2012, while finance sector credit grew at 28.2% \nin FY2007 and 30.1% in FY2012. \n6  The government has established a task force to review the balance of payments with India. \n ", "3 \ntransactions, especially for cross border purchases between India and Bhutan. This measure \nshould have important spillovers in terms of promoting the development of the banking system, \ngreater disclosure, and strengthening the government\u2019s revenue efforts. Third, the RMA has \nsought to improve liquidity management through the introduction of the base and policy rates \nwith  the  goal  of  keeping  short-term  interest  rates  within  respective  policy  corridors  and \ncontaining growth of monetary aggregates to desired trajectories. This should be complemented \nby  a  more  robust  growth  of  macro-prudential  regulation  system  to  complement  monetary \nmanagement.7  \n \n14.   Structural considerations. The current rupee liquidity crunch was caused by structural \nand cyclical factors that reflect weak economic management. On the structural side, Bhutan \ncontinues to rely heavily on hydroelectricity exports to India supported by bilateral agreements. \nUnder these agreements, the Government of India provides rupee financing\u201430% grants and \n70% loans\u2014to construct hydropower plants, and the Government of Bhutan earns rupees from \nexports of electricity to India. The ngultrum\u2019s peg at par with the rupee is a natural foreign \nexchange  hedge.8 The  large  and  lumpy  nature  of  imports  of  construction  equipment  and \nmaterials for building power plants, and the long gestation between construction and operations, \ncan push the trade balance sharply into deficit. Over time, as construction is completed and \nplants  go  onstream,  exports  increase,  the  trade  balance  gradually  improves,  and  export \nearnings meet loan servicing requirements. In the meantime, sizable positive capital inflows \nfrom capital grants and development assistance keeps Bhutan\u2019s balance of payments in surplus.  \n \n15.  A  more  recent  phenomenon  derives  from  rising  household  incomes.  As  most \nconsumable goods are imported from India, rapidly expanding income per capita in Bhutan has \nput further pressure on the trade deficit. Growing imports of vehicles and construction materials, \nincluding those for the housing boom, have contributed to the large import bill from India. \nFurther, limited ability to contain public spending and fiscal deficits widened trade deficits and \nput  pressure  on  the  balance  of  payments  with  India.  On  the  monetary  front,  the  limited \neffectiveness of monetary and liquidity management instruments to stabilize inflation and avoid \nasset price buildup, and the limited success in effectively applying macro-prudential regulations \nto address intensifying macro-financial risks in the economy, contributed to the problem. \n \n16.  Cyclical considerations. On the cyclical side, there has been a combination of timing \nconsiderations that has adversely affected the BOP position in Bhutan. First, from a debt \nmanagement perspective, on the demand for rupees, loan payments have spiked with a few \nlumpy payments having come due in early part of the year (every 1 January in the case of Tala \nPower Project), which has led to further demand for rupees. In December 2011, when the \nexternal imbalance with India became significantly large, the RMA and the government had to \nsell $200 million from gross international reserves to settle the rupee bills from India. Second, \nfrom a fiscal management perspective, this heavy dependence on the timing of hydropower \nprojects coming on stream over the medium-term and on uncertain donor support (grants) amid \nthe global financial crisis has increased the fiscal uncertainty and resource constraints. In \naddition,  with  Bhutan  reaching  middle  income  status,  its  share  of  concessional  lending  is \nexpected  to  decline.  More recently,  it  has  had  to  incur  in  relatively  costly  borrowing from \ndesignated commercial financial institutions in India to provide for rupees, as required under the \nexisting ngultrum\u2013rupee currency peg arrangement. The cyclical nature of electricity exports \nreflecting the run-of-river hydropower plants results in a relative easing of the tight cash flow and \n                                                \n7  ADB  technical  assistance  will  support  measures  to  strengthen  liquidity  management  and  introduce  macro-\nprudential reforms. ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Supporting Financial Stability in Bhutan and the Maldives. \nManila (TA 8284-REG). \n8  Though the rupee is not legal tender in Bhutan, it was used widely as if it were, as there were no regulations \nlimiting convertibility until recently.  \n ", "4  \nrupee liquidity positions during the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the \nyear. \n \n17.  Strategic considerations. The key challenge for Bhutan is how to maintain high, stable, \nand sustainable growth over the coming years, coinciding with the concentration of construction \nof hydropower projects, while avoiding widening domestic and external economic imbalances. \nBhutan's  weak  economic  management  is  attributed  primarily  to  three factors: (i) the  rapid \nbuildup in public spending,9 (ii) ineffective liquidity management, and (iii) the lack of savings \ninstruments to mobilize  higher  domestic  savings.10 All  these factors  caused  high  domestic \nabsorption  not  supported  by  adequate  domestic  savings,  either  public  or  private.  The \nconsequent investment\u2013savings gap generated a high current account deficit. If the critical \nfactors  are  not  properly  addressed, the  economy  may  be  headed for  a  hard  landing  with \npotentially large economic losses reversing recent gains in socioeconomic development.  \n \n18.  Political  transformation.  In  2008,  Bhutan  successfully  completed  its  political \ntransformation from  absolute  monarchy  to  constitutional monarchy  through  a  peaceful  and \nstable process of democratization. The country\u2019s first general election for the National Assembly \nwas held in March 2008. A new election is scheduled in June 2013 and a smooth election \nprocess is expected. \n \n19.  ADB country partnership strategy. The Bhutan interim country partnership strategy, \n2012\u20132013 acknowledges that \u201cthe tight overall balance with India has recently placed great \npressure on rupee liquidity\u201d and that \u201cthere is limited scope to sell additional reserves\u201d because \nthe constitution requires foreign exchange reserves to be maintained to cover 12 months of \nessential imports (i.e., $448.9 million).11 The interim strategy also acknowledges that to maintain \na  high  and  sustainable  growth  trajectory,  more  needs  to  be  done  to  improve  economic \nmanagement including strengthening of fiscal management. Improved monetary management\u2014\nincluding measures for better foreign exchange reserves management\u2014is another priority area \nfor creating an environment conducive for high growth in a sustained manner.  \n \n20.  Lessons. The  current program  draws  lessons from  past  ADB  experience  of  public \nresource management programs in South Asia12 and policy-based loans in the small economies \nsuch as the Economic Recovery Program in Maldives and the Financial Sector Development \nProgram in Bhutan.13 Two important lessons are that (i) government commitment is the most \nimportant prerequisite for a successful program; and (ii) sustained engagement with government \nofficials, including capacity development, is required to support timely program implementation. \n \n21.   Building on the strategic considerations, the program adopts a two-pronged approach to \nconfront the challenges of weak economic management in Bhutan. First, it will improve fiscal \nmanagement to help the government allocate scarce resources more effectively and efficiently. \nMoreover, better debt management and Treasury operations will improve cash management, \nwhich  will  make  flow  of  funds  more  predictable  and  avoid  destabilizing  spikes  in  debt \n                                                \n9  While Bhutan largely pursued prudent fiscal policy, spending since 2010 widened fiscal deficits. \n10  Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Article 14, Section 7 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan, 2008. As of March 2012, Bhutan\u2019s gross \ninternational reserves stood at $769.1 million, of which $196 million was pledged against the overdraft facility \nextended from State Bank of India, $448.9 million was set aside as reserve to cover 12 months of essential imports, \nand $120 million backed ngultrum in circulation.  \n12 ADB. 2007.

Second, it will improve monetary management to ensure that interest rate policy \nbetter  matches  the  demand  and  supply  of  loanable  funds,  thereby  improving  liquidity \nmanagement. This will help create a stable economic environment to instill investor confidence \nand encourage private investment to sustain growth.14 This approach will be reinforced by \nstrengthening internal and external audit systems to improve the monitoring of public resources \nand strengthen administrative and financial efficiency and accountability including at the sub-\nnational level of government. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n22.  The  impact  will  be  sustainably  strengthened  macro-financial  management  by  the \ngovernment. The outcome will be more effective use of the country\u2019s own financial resources in \na predictable manner. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n23.  The program is structured around reform and policy actions agreed between ADB and \nthe Government of Bhutan as summarized in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). Four outputs \nachieved during the program period will better enable the government to address economic \nrisks and lay the foundations of sustainable growth.  \n \n24.  Output 1: Improved budget and debt management systems. First, the program aims \nto  improve  allocative  efficiency  of  scarce  public  resources,  whereby,  initiatives  under  this \nprogram component will include expenditure allocations based on medium-term expenditure \nframeworks  in  selected  municipalities.  Second,  the  program  will  also  strengthen  the  debt \nmanagement system in Bhutan to smoothen out debt servicing payments and avoid potentially \ndestabilizing  future  debt  servicing  spikes,  and  enhance  debt  management  capacity.  The \nprogram will facilitate in developing a debt management strategy over the medium-term and a \ndebt  management  action  plan  including  the  plan  for  strengthening  the  debt  management \ndivision. The action plan will also address the issues and challenges pertaining to (i) narrow \ninvestor base, (ii) lack of auction calendar, (iii) promoting price competition in auctioning of \ngovernment securities, and (iv) functional integration of Treasury Management Division and \nDebt Management Division for improved cash management. \n \n25.  Output 2: Improved revenue effort and revenue management system. The program \nwill help the government improve its revenue collection by introducing a revenue administration \nmanagement information system.  \n \n26.  Output 3: Improved macro-prudential management framework. Improving macro-\nprudential  management  framework  will  be  a  key  component  under  the  program  for \nstrengthening economic management.  Policy actions will be initiated to (i) improve macro-\nprudential framework, (ii) develop the capital markets, (iii) develop the mutual funds and fund \nmanagement industry, and (iv) develop regulatory and supervisory structure of the domestic \ncredit rating agency. Under improving macro-prudential framework, RMA will develop policies \nand rules to deal with, among others (i) loan to value ratio, (ii) debt to equity ratio for project \nfinancing, (iii) risk weighted capital requirements, (iv) dynamic capital provisioning, and (v) \nimprove retail to wholesale deposit ratio. The RMA will coordinate with the Royal Securities \nExchange of Bhutan to complete a capital markets master plan. Finally, the RMA will take the \nsteps necessary, including approving the regulatory system, to develop the fund management \nindustry in Bhutan. \n                                                \n14 Private investment will be critical to diversifying Bhutan\u2019s exports to other sectors such as tourism and agro-based \nlight manufacturing.  \n ", "6  \n27.  Output 4: Improved external and internal audit operations. Improving audit systems \nis a prerequisite to better economic management. The Royal Audit Authority will phase in an \naudit resource management system over the program period. All the major departments will \ntrain staff to carry out internal audits. \n \n28.   In the absence of reform measures\u2014with inflation, fiscal deficit, and current account \ndeficit increasing and already at relatively high levels\u2014the economy may run the risk of a hard \nlanding and even recession.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n29.   Bhutan\u2019s Vision 2020 fully committed the country to developing 10 hydropower projects \nthrough bilateral agreements with India. As of the end of October 2012, three hydropower \nprojects namely Chukha, Kurichu, and Tala, were developed and operating. Construction is \nunder way for four hydropower projects: Punatsangchhu I and II, Dagachhu, and Mandechhu.15 \nThe government is also planning to embark on the construction of six new hydropower projects \nduring FY2014. Therefore, the increase in the external debt stock on account of hydropower \nprojects alone for the period ending FY2013 is estimated at Nu16.68 billion ($313 million or 16.2% \nof GDP) and is projected to grow by Nu34.13 billion ($609 million) and Nu43.62 billion ($763 \nmillion) in FY2014 and FY2015, respectively. \n \n30.  Given low domestic savings and limited scope for significantly increasing public revenue, \nBhutan has a policy of allocating external concessional loans and grants on capital expenditures \nand using domestic revenue for current expenditure. Any financing of infrastructure is thus \nconstrained by the limits of external development financing assistance and, more generally, by \nthe fiscal and debt targets under the medium-term fiscal framework. The fiscal deficit during \nFY2012\u2013FY2015  is  estimated  at  Nu9.62  billion,  the  bulk  of  it  dependent  on  external \ndevelopment financing (Table 1). The development resource gap is estimated at $158.25 million \nduring the same period.16 An average ratio of capital expenditure to total expenditure of 47% \nprojects an estimated development resource gap for capital expenditure of $74.26 million.

It indicates the additional resources required beyond expected new \nborrowings.  \n17 On a parallel basis, ADB is advising the Government of Bhutan on raising rupee resources through market \nborrowings. Options include (i) an offshore sovereign rupee bond issue with a partial credit guarantee from ADB, \n(ii) an offshore rupee bond issue by state-owned enterprises with a partial credit guarantee from ADB, which is \ncovered by the sovereign counter guarantee, and (iii) a rupee or dollar syndication loan with a partial credit \nguarantee from ADB. \n18  Fiscal Projections (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n31.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR9,224,000 \n($14.19 million) and a grant not exceeding $20.81 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears,  an  interest  rate of 1.0% per  annum  during the grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing agreement.  \n \n32.  Development coordination. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nand ADB are the key development partners supporting the government\u2019s undertaking public \nmanagement  reforms.  World  Bank  support  under  its  Second  Development  Policy  Credit \nProgram will strengthen rules and regulations including audit and accounting standards, the \nAnti-corruption Act 2006, rules on occupational health, the Road Act 2004, and a disaster \nmanagement bill.19  The IMF does not have a program in Bhutan but will field its Article IV \nreview mission in late 2013, as Bhutan is on a 24-month cycle and had Article IV consultation in \n2011.20 Discussions have been held with both the IMF and the World Bank on the program, and \ncoordination has been very effective.21  \n \nE.  Program Implementation Arrangements \n \n33.  Management, tranches, and review. The Department of Public Accounts (DPA) in the \nMOF will be the executing agency and will oversee and coordinate the timely implementation of \nagreed policy actions. The implementing agencies will be the DPA, Department of Revenue and \nCustoms, Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, Royal Audit Authority, and RMA. Each will \nbe responsible for undertaking the policy actions or program activities under its responsibilities \ndescribed in the policy matrix. Ongoing technical assistance will help the government fulfill \nprogram conditions (footnote 23). The DPA will be responsible for program administration, \ndisbursements, and maintaining all program records. A program steering committee will be set \nup and chaired by the secretary and/or joint secretary of the MOF. The committee will have \nrepresentatives of other departments and authorities concerned, including the Department of \nRevenue and Customs, Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, Royal Audit Authority, and \nRMA. The committee will meet once in every quarter and monitor the progress of the program. \nThe loan of SDR9,224,000 and grant of $20.81 million will be provided in two tranches and \ndisbursed upon satisfaction of loan and grant effectiveness conditions\u2014that is, fulfillment of all \nactions in the program policy matrix. The first tranche will be the grant and the second tranche \nthe loan. The first tranche is expected to be disbursed in March 2013. The government shall \nundertake periodic reviews during implementation to evaluate program scope, implementation \narrangements,  progress,  and  achievement  of objectives.  In  addition  to  periodic  reviews,  a \nmidterm review will take place during the fourth quarter of 2013. \n \n34.  Procurement, disbursement, and counterpart funds. Loan and grant proceeds will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for policy-based loans and grants.22 ADB will have the right to audit the use of the \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. Local currency generated \nfrom the loan and grant will be deposited into the government\u2019s budget fund account with the \nBank of Bhutan toward providing supplementary financing for the 2013 budget. \n \n35.  Policy actions and dialogue. The government will ensure that all policies adopted and \nactions taken under the program, as set forth in the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and \nthe policy matrix (Appendix 4), continue to be in effect for the duration of the program. \n                                                \n19  World Bank. 2012.

The  DPA  will  establish  a \nperformance  evaluation  system  for  the  program  within  3  months  from  grant  and  loan \neffectiveness and maintain it. Using this system, the DPA will monitor the program and report to \nADB on the implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with \nthe program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. \n  \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n37.  Although the proposed program does not have a piggybacked technical assistance (TA), \nit will be supported by five TAs.23   \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n38.  Several  outputs  of  the  program  have  technical  components  at  their  core.  The \nintroduction of revenue administration and property valuation systems is expected to strengthen \ntax administration and improve compliance. The rollout of an audit information management \nsystem  is  expected  to  improve  external  and  internal  audit  operations  and  compliance  of \ngovernance.  \n \nB.  Economic  \n \n39.   Despite the current rupee liquidity crunch, the government projects that the economy \nwill grow at an average of 9.8% during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018 and about 15% \nby FY2020, the year stipulated in Vision 2020. The hydropower sector will be the main driver, \ncontributing 56% of growth. To finance projected economic growth, external debt service as a \npercentage of GDP is estimated at 6.81% in FY2014 and 3.92% in FY2015.24  \n \n40.  The current account deficit with India is projected to reach 15.9% of GDP in FY2013 and \nto  have  increased  to  28.4%  by  FY2015,  mainly  reflecting  expanded  imports  to  construct \nhydropower projects. To manage the anticipated rupee shortage, the RMA has introduced a \nnew policy that requires demand for rupees to be justified to better manage the rupee liquidity \nposition and is accessing the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation currency swap \nfacility launched in May 2012.25 In addition, the Government of India has recently increased to \nRs10 billion its line of credit to the Government of Bhutan for addressing the rupee shortfall. \n \n41.  Though the aggregate current account is projected to be in deficit equal to 23.2% of \nGDP in FY2013 and is expected to deteriorate further to 34.6% of GDP in FY2015, the overall \nbalance of payment is projected to be in surplus equal to 2.8% of GDP in FY2013 and improve \n                                                \n23 Implementation of the program will be complemented by ADB\u2019s (i) two ongoing capacity development technical \nassistance namely (a) ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Public \nManagement. Manila (TA 7724-BHU) and (b) ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nStrengthening Audit Resource Management. Manila (TA 7723-BHU); and (ii) three recently approved TAs namely, \n(a) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Capital Market Development. Manila (TA 8280-\nBHU), (b) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Supporting Financial Stability in Bhutan and the Maldives. Manila \n(TA 8284-REG), and (c) ADB. 2012. Strengthening Royal Monetary Authority's Regulatory Capacity for Nonbank \nFinancial Institutions. Manila (TA 8076-BHU). All will reinforce good practices in revenue and audit in line with the \nneeds of a maturing and more complex economy.   \n24  The IMF considers the debt to be sustainable as it is predominantly for building hydropower projects through \nproject finance with high financial rates of return. \n25 The$2.0 billion facility was set up by the Reserve Bank of India in May 2012 and is available in both foreign \ncurrency and Indian rupees against the domestic currency of member central banks including the RMA. It is short \nterm in nature and targets sudden shortfalls caused by capital outflows resulting from shocks. \n ", "9 \nto 6.2% in FY2015, mainly from inflows of external grants and concessional loans. The country\u2019s \ntotal reserves are projected to grow from $806 million in FY2013 to $1.1 billion by FY2015, \nenabling  Bhutan  to  comply  with  the  constitutional  requirement  of  covering  12  months  of \nessential merchandise imports or the guided minimum reserve requirement of $500 million.26  \n \n42.   The current account deficit, rupee liquidity crunch, and credit and fiscal expansions are \nplacing upward pressure on inflation, forecasted by ADB to reach 10.1% in FY2013 and 10.5% \nin FY2014. Accordingly, ADB has recently revised its GDP growth forecast for Bhutan down \nslightly from 8.0% to 7.9% in FY2013 and from 8.5% to 8.4% in FY2014. However, the general \nconsensus is that the rupee liquidity crunch will subside over the longer term once hydropower \nplants are fully built and generating export revenue. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n43.  Program preparation included a governance risk assessment conducted along the lines \nprescribed by the implementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan.27 This assessment was complemented by a review of areas of possible risk and \nvulnerability in state financial management. The assessment found some vulnerability that could \naffect the proposed program related to (i) political support for the Government of Bhutan and its \nownership of the program and (ii) such institutional dimensions as weak capacity. Despite \ncapacity constraints, public resources are managed reasonably well in Bhutan. Some areas that \nrequire  rectification  are  (i)  inadequate  cash  management  including  revenue  projections, \n(ii) weak debt management capacity including institutional arrangements, and (iii) weak audit \nsystems and procedures. While no major risk of resource mismanagement at the executing \nlevel can be discerned, issues raised in the assessments are addressed in the program. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n44.  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  performed  well  during  FY2001\u20132011,  achieving  an  average  8% \neconomic growth rate. As a result, the country has made remarkable progress in reducing \npoverty incidence, which declined from 32% in 2003 to 23% in 2007. However, if the ongoing \nIndian rupee liquidity issue persists, it can cause a hard landing, and have a direct impact on \npoverty. The program will help the government avoid the risks of a contraction or significant \nslowdown in GDP growth and make further progress in reducing poverty and achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals.28 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n45.  The program\u2019s primary aim is to improve government economic management through \nbudget support. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n26 Essential imports are loosely defined to include (i) food, household, and medical items; (ii) raw materials; and (iii) \nreplacement and spares for capital equipment.  \n27 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, the implementation of the program will adhere to ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy. \n28 For Millennium Development Goals for Bhutan, please refer to Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness \nCommission. 2011.
