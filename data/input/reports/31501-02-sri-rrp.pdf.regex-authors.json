Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and \nAssessment  environmental management plans (EMPs) have been undertaken \nfor  each  of  the  four  project  towns.  The  revised  and  updated \nsummary IEE (SIEE) is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n   \nProject Description  The supplementary loans for the Secondary Towns and Rural \nCommunity-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project support \nthe  objectives  and  scope  of  the  original  project.  As  such,  the \nsupplementary loans aim to contribute to poverty reduction efforts \nby increasing access to safe water and sanitation of the poor, \nthereby  improving  their  living  conditions,  especially  those  of \nwomen. Within this framework, the following challenges continue \nto  be  addressed  in  the  Project:  (i)  contributing  to  the \nreconstruction  efforts  by  providing  piped  water  to  major  urban \ncenters  in  the  northeast  of  the  country;  (ii)  supporting  the \ndevolution of rural water supply and sanitation to the provincial \ncouncils and Pradeshiya Sabhas (PSs); and (iii) supporting the \nsector  reforms  identified  in  previous  interventions,  including \nachievement of cost recovery (operation and maintenance, debt \nservice  and  depreciation),  independent  regulation  of  the  water \nsector,  and  increased  community-based  participation  in  the \nsector. The Project will provide water in two major urban areas in \nthe North-East Province (Batticaloa and Muttur), one urban area \nin the North Central Province (Polonnaruwa), and one urban area \nin  the  Southern  Province  (Hambantota).  The  Project  is  also \nimplementing a rural water supply program in the North Central \nand North-East Province through community-based organizations \n(CBOs),  local  government,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and supports the National Water Supply and Drainage \nBoard  (NWSDB)  to  advance  and  adapt  to  the  ongoing  sector \nreforms  by  improving  its  operational  efficiency  and  financial \nmanagement.   \n   \nRationale  Provision  of  safe  drinking  water  through  construction  of  new \nschemes and augmentation of existing ones represents a major \nmilestone in the Government\u2019s New Development Strategy, and \ntherefore a priority for the Government of Sri Lanka. The Project \ncontinues  to  be  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in \n(i) promoting regionally balanced development, (ii) rehabilitating ", "ii   \nand reconstructing the conflict-affected areas, and (iii) reducing \npoverty and ensuring equitable development. The supplementary \nloans  will  assist  the  Government  in  delivering  the  originally \ndefined  objectives.  People  in  project  areas  are  vulnerable \nresulting from  years of conflict and impacts resulting from the \n2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.     \n \nThe  Project  has  suffered  a  cost  overrun  because  of  price \nescalation factors, initial undercosting and detailed engineering \ndesign modifications. Rationale for supplementary loans includes: \n(i) alignment with the priorities of the Government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); (ii) physical changes within the original \nscope, have been assessed along with their impacts in the context \nof  current  ADB  policies;  (iii)  the  revised  Project  is  technically \nfeasible, institutionally sound, economically viable, and financially \nsustainable;  (iv)  ongoing  activities  (including  construction \npackages) and those modified have been reviewed for safeguards \ncompliance and shown to be sound; and (v) all steps in the matrix \nof due diligence have been observed (including technical, capacity \nand  institutional  assessments,  and  economic  and  financial \nanalyses of the revised Project). \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The overall goal of the Project continues to be contributing to \npoverty reduction efforts and promoting human development by \nimproving  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  for  poor \npopulations,  thereby  decreasing  waterborne  diseases  and \nreducing the amount of resources spent in these activities. The \nProject objectives are to: (i) provide safe water to 946,000 people \nand sanitation to 171,500 in four urban areas, and in rural areas of \nthe North Central and North-East provinces; and (ii) increase the \ncapacity  of  the  Government  to  provide  safe  water  by \nstrengthening the water sector institutions. \n \nThe revised project components are: (i) provision of urban water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  drainage  in  the  towns  of  Batticaloa, \nHambantota, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa; (ii) provision of rural water \nsupply  and  sanitation  in  the  districts  of  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa in the North Central Province, and Batticaloa in the \nNorth-East Province; and (iii) institutional strengthening focusing \non  training,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  improvement  of \noperational and financial management of the NWSDB. Marginal \ndifferences  with  the  original  scope  include  an  additional  rural \nwater  supply  subcomponent  in  Batticaloa  and  eliminating  the \nconstruction of Matara\u2019s salinity barrier. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The revised total cost of the Project is estimated at $175.2 million \nequivalent, including taxes, duties, interest charges on the ADB \nloans, and physical and price contingencies. The supplementary \nloans are proposed to amount to $60 million equivalent.  \n \n ", "  iii\nThe project cost increase is $80.8 million, whereas the financing \ngap is estimated to be $88.8 million or approximately 100% of the \noriginal project cost. Factors and reasons leading to cost overrun \nin the Project include: (i) price increases (about 36% of the cost \noverrun), (ii) cost underestimation at appraisal (about 24% of the \ncost overrun), (iii) physical changes during detailed engineering \ndesign (about 21% of the cost overrun), and (iv) underestimation \nand  increases  in  government  taxes  and  duties  for  goods  and \nservices (about 19% of the cost overrun).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $60.3 million equivalent was originally allocated from \nADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF). In addition, supplementary \nloans amounting to $46.5 million equivalent will be provided from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF) and $13.5 million will be \nprovided from ordinary capital resources (OCR). ADF resources \nfor supplementary loans will be provided from a variety of sources \nwhich include: (i) the reallocation of the equivalent of $18.5 million \nin ADF resources from unutilized loan proceeds of closed loans to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka, and (ii) a new ADF allocation of \n$28.0 million equivalent. The Government will provide a total of \n$51.8  million  equivalent  and  the  community  $3.0  million \nequivalent. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \nThe OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility, \nconversion  options  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. It is proposed that new loan and project agreements \nbe prepared for (i) ADF loan, and (ii) the OCR loan. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will make loan proceeds available to NWSDB \nTerms  through new subsidiary financing agreements acceptable to ADB. \nThe ratio of grant and loan is expected to be determined based on \nthe urban and rural population ratio in the project areas. Based on \nthe subsidiary financing agreement signed between NWSDB and \nthe Government for the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-\nBased Water Supply and Sanitation Project, (i) 85% of funding for \nwater supply schemes in PSs will be made available to NWSDB \nas a grant and 15% as a loan; (ii) for urban councils and municipal \ncouncils, 50% of funding will be provided as a grant and 50% as a \nloan;  and  (iii)  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems \nimplemented by communities, 100% of funding will be provided as \na grant. The subsidiary loan from the Government to NWSDB will \nhave an interest rate of 10% with a 24-year term, including a 5-\nyear grace period. \n   \n ", "iv   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2010 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  It is proposed that, as for the original project, NWSDB, under the \nMinistry of Urban Development and Water Supply (MUDWS), be \nthe Executing Agency for the supplementary loans.  \n   \nImplementation  Implementation  structures  under  the  original  project  will  be \nArrangements  charged with the implementation of supplementary loans. These \nconsist of (i) a project management unit (PMU), established in \nColombo  under  NWSDB,  (ii)  five  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs),  (iii)  eight  (and  in  future  six  additional  units  to  support \nbatch 2) PS implementation units (PSIUs), and (iv) four technical \nsupport units (TSUs). Policy and strategic decisions and PMU \nguidance  will  be  provided  by  the  existing  national  steering \ncommittee chaired by the secretary of MUDWS, and coordination \nfor  the  rural  PSIUs  continue  to  be  provided  by  the  project \nprovincial coordinating committee established in the North Central \nand North-East provincial councils. Where necessary, additional \ncomplementary  project  coordinating  committees  will  be \nestablished at the district, divisional, and village levels. Despite \nincreasing concerns over the deterioration of the security situation \nin the north and east of the country, implementation is, in general, \nprogressing  effectively  and  largely  undisrupted,  as  most \nconstruction activities are in government cleared areas. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by ADB supplementary loans will \ncontinue to be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines, as amended from time to time. Urban water supply \nschemes will be built according to procurement packages agreed \nby  the  Inception  Mission  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural \nCommunity-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,  which \ninclude design-and-build contracts and supply-and-lay packages \nfor  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  and  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB). As for the original project, civil work \ncontracts  valued  over  $2.5  million  equivalent  and  equipment \ncontracts  valued  over  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  undertaken \nthrough  ICB  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $2.5 \nmillion  equivalent  or  less  will  be  carried  out  under  NCB \nprocedures. Equipment packages valued at $500,000 equivalent \nor  less  will  be  procured  following  NCB  procedures.  All \nconstruction works for the rural component are still expected to be \nvalued  at  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  and  therefore  to  be \nprocured through NCB, or, in the case of contracts valued at less \nthan SLRs5 million (approximately $50,000 equivalent), by CBOs \nthrough procedures for community participation in procurement \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  In addition to consulting services provided under the Secondary \nTowns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation ", "  v\nProject, it is envisaged that an additional 1,500 person-months of \nlocal  supervisory  staff  inputs  will  be  required  to  supervise  the \ncontractors'  work  sites  simultaneously.  The  additional \nrequirements  are  based  on  organizational  needs  for  adequate \nsupervision  of  all  contracts,  including  4  design-and-build  type \ncontracts and the 12 bill-of-quantity type contracts. The proposed \nadditional consultant inputs will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006), through the \nsingle source selection method with the firm already selected for \npackage B of the Project, as proposed tasks represent a natural \ncontinuation  of  previous  work.  The  firm  will  be  requested  to \nprovide a biodata technical proposal for review and negotiation by \nNWSDB  and  ADB.  Terms  of  reference  and  qualification \nrequirements for consultants will follow the original contract. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  number  of  direct  project  beneficiaries  remains  largely \nBeneficiaries  unchanged, at around 946,000 people, who will profit from a rise \nin standard of living based on the provision of basic needs. Of \nthese, 575,500 people in urban areas will gain access to piped \nwater supplies and 370,500 people in rural areas will gain access \nto  improved  safe  sources  of  water.  As  envisaged  under  the \noriginal project design, after project completion, 171,500 people \nwill have access to improved sanitation and better understanding \nof  hygiene  in  four  urban  areas  and  three  rural  districts.  The \nproposed sanitation and sewerage improvements will significantly \nreduce  pollution  in  the  project  towns  and  their  immediate \nsurroundings,  and  will  provide  a  proven  mechanism  for  easy \nreplication. \n \nThe  main  benefits  of  the  Project  remain  (i)  improved  health; \n(ii) less resources (time and cash) spent by households in water \nprovision, especially by women and young girls; and (iii) support \nto environmentally sustainable economic and population growth, \nespecially in the urban centers. By reducing child mortality and \nmalnutrition  caused  by  waterborne  diseases,  and  increasing \nenvironmental sustainability through a reduction of groundwater \noverextraction and unsafe sanitation practices, the Project directly \naddresses ADB\u2019s goal of poverty reduction and contributes to the \nachievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Poor \nhouseholds are encouraged to participate as project beneficiaries. \n \nThe Project will translate into visible improvements to the living \nconditions of the civilian population, which has suffered decades \nof civil unrest. It will also continue to support the reconciliation \nprocess. Commitment and cooperation for project implementation \nby both sides in the conflict in the North-East Province support the \nframework and platform to sustain peace building.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project continues to assume (i) a stable political environment \nand  positive  economic  growth  in  Sri  Lanka;  (ii)  continuing \ngovernment  support  to  the  Project,  in  the  form  of  timely \nprocurement  and  availability  of  funds,  and  support  to  the \n ", "vi   \ndecentralization process; and (iii) independent regulation of the \nwater  sector  and  the  improved  efficiency  of  water  service \nprovision. Especially, it is assumed that tariff setting will be driven \nby  financial  considerations  and  that  it  will  be  independent  of \npolitical  influence,  to  achieve  adequate  levels  of  project  cost \nrecovery and proper asset management. In addition, the Project \nassumes  that  contractor  collusion  will  be  prevented  and \ncompetition encouraged. \n \nReduced political support for sector reforms would impede the \nimplementation of the strategies to improve the operational and \nfinancial efficiency of NWSDB and other service providers. Data \nmonitoring under Component 3 during project reviews will provide \nthe  necessary  diagnosis  for  continued  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment. \n \nWhile commitment to providing safe water and sanitation remains \na priority to all parties, there is a risk that deterioration of the \nsecurity situation may delay project implementation in Batticaloa \nand  Muttur.  Safety  and  effectiveness  will  remain  ADB\u2019s  main \nconcern  during  the  remainder  of  project  implementation.  ADB, \ninformed  by  (i)  internal  security  and  United  Nations  security \nbriefings, and (ii) PMU weekly updates, will closely monitor the \nsecurity situation and carefully guide implementation accordingly. \nDialogue will be continued with partners and project beneficiaries, \nwhich will enable a prognosis in project areas and guide decision \nmaking.     \n   \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nsupplementary loans, both to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, for the Secondary \nTowns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  The Context \n2.  In February 2002 a ceasefire agreement was signed in Sri Lanka, beginning the long \nprocess of negotiating a permanent end to a conflict which had affected the country for over 20 \nyears. Processed against this background, the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project1 presented a balanced investment proposal whereby much \nneeded water infrastructure (a key element for convergence) was to be provided to deprived \ntowns in both the east and south of the country. Furthermore, in December 2004, the Indian \nOcean tsunami impacted coastal areas of the Southern and North-East provinces, significantly \naffecting towns supported under the Project. Despite varying levels of dialogue experienced \nsince the approval of the Project and a decline in the security situation over the past few \nmonths,  the  provision  of  safe  drinking  water  and  adequate  sanitation  systems  to  poor \nhouseholds remains one of the highest priorities for all stakeholders. \n \nB.  Project Rationale \n3.  Notwithstanding a significant increase in the population percentage with access to safe \nwater sources, from 68% in 1994 to 77% in 2000,2 only about 30% has a household connection \nto a piped system while 10% of the population is covered by hand pump tube wells.3 Similarly, \nurban population with access to improved sanitation increased from 89% to 98% from 1990 to \n2002 while rural coverage rose from 64% to 89%. Overall, 80% of the population has access to \non-site  sanitation  facilities  but  wastewater  collection  and  disposal  systems  are  not  widely \navailable.4 Although groundwater quality in most parts of the country is of reasonable quality, \nbiological contamination, high levels of fluoride and salinity intrusion in wells and water intakes \nare  common  problems.  Urban  growth  has  increased  pressure  on  scarce  water  resources, \nstressing the need to expedite provision of piped water supply. Towns such as Batticaloa, \nHambantota, and Muttur are located in water scarce areas where water quantity is limited and \nquality frequently does not meet required standards. At the time of appraisal (September 2002), \nmore than 40% of households had incomes below the poverty line in Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, \nand Muttur; in Hambantota, approximately 25% of households were poor. Poverty and lack of \naccess to services were found to be highly correlated among sample populations in all project \ntowns. In Hambantota, 45% of households had access to piped water, but this figure was as low \nas 19% for Polonnaruwa, 4% for Batticaloa, and 0% for Muttur. The incidence of water and \nsanitation  related  diseases  were  found  to  be  highest  among  populations  where  a  higher \npercentage of households lacked private sanitation facilities. The incidence of water-related \ndiseases was found to be highest in Muttur, affecting almost 40% of surveyed households.5 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Colombo.  \n4  Only a fraction of Colombo currently has sewerage facilities while Hikadduwa and Kandy are in the process of \nintroducing related services. Regional disparities are also significant. \n5  Although present socioeconomic baselines will only be completed by the end 2006, the tsunami is believed to have \nsignificantly worsened reported conditions in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, and Muttur.  \n ", "2   \n4.  The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), responsible to the Ministry of \nUrban Development and Water Supply (MUDWS), is the primary agency responsible for water \nsupply  (covering  75%  of  over  500  piped  water  supply  systems).  Local  authorities  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  operate  and  maintain  the  remainder.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been a partner in Sri Lanka\u2019s water supply and sanitation sector, \nassisting the Government for 20 years in the design and implementation of four successive \nloans, and recently embarked on a project to support delivery of basic urban infrastructure and \nservices for local authorities.6 ADB has consistently assisted the Government in improving \nsector policies, operational efficiency, and sustainability. 7  \n \nC.  Objectives and Scope \n5.  In  March  2002,  the  Government  and  ADB  signed  a  poverty  reduction  partnership \nagreement,  highlighting  the  importance  of  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  in \nreducing poverty in Sri Lanka. On 16 January 2003, ADB approved a loan equivalent to $60.3 \nmillion from ADB's Special Funds resources for the Secondary Towns and Rural Community \nBased Water Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 1). The loan was declared effective on 21 \nNovember 2003 and the project completion date set to be 30 September 2009. The goal of this \nProject is to reduce poverty and promote human development by reducing the incidence of \nwaterborne  diseases  and  by  reducing  the  time  and  resources  that  households  spend  in \nacquiring water. Its objective is to provide safe drinking water and safe sanitation to people in \nproject areas. The Project will increase the capacity of water sector institutions to operate, \nmaintain, augment existing water schemes and invest in new water schemes in rural and urban \nareas.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy,8 as  it  fosters  the  necessary \nimprovement and expansion of delivery services in Sri Lanka, promotes conservation of water, \nimproved operational and financial efficiency and governance. The Project aims to provide 24-\nhour supply in all four urban areas, and supports the Government\u2019s efforts in providing access \nto improved sanitation facilities for all through its urban and rural sanitation components. \n \n6.  Outcome and Outputs. The Project was designed to improve the standard of living in \nrural areas of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts in the North Central Province; and in the \ntowns of Batticaloa and Muttur in the North-East Province, Hambantota and Matara in the \nSouthern  Province,  and  Polonnaruwa  in  the  North  Central  Province.  The  Project  is  also \ndesigned to increase the financial and institutional sustainability of NWSDB and the institutional \ncapacity  of  provincial  councils,  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  (PSs),  and  CBOs  participating  in  the \nProject.  The  project  design,  as  originally  defined,  anticipates  accomplishment  of  three \ncomponents, related outputs and activities. \n \n7.  Component 1 (urban component) anticipates: (i) provision of new piped water supply \nsystems and improved drainage in the towns of Batticaloa and Muttur, (ii) expansion of existing \nwater supply systems in the towns of Polonnaruwa and Hambantota, (iii) construction of a \nsalinity  barrier  at  the  intake  in  Matara  to  prevent  saline  intrusion  during  dry  periods, \n(iv)  provision of wastewater collection and treatment for Batticaloa Hospital, (v) improvement of \ndrainage  schemes  in  the  most  densely  populated  areas  of  Batticaloa  and  Muttur,  and \n(vi) provision of a low-cost latrine program.  \n \n8.  Component 2 (rural component) is expected to provide: (i) organization of beneficiaries \ninto CBOs; (ii) CBO capacity development to implement, operate, and maintain water supply \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

Component 3 (institutional strengthening) will: (i) deliver a national public awareness and \neducation campaign; (ii) support the implementation of NWSDB\u2019s corporate strategy to improve \nfinancial planning and resource allocation; (iii) support the implementation of the strategy and \naction plan to address audit, accounting, and financial management issues; (iv) support the \nimplementation of NWSDB\u2019s action plan to improve operational performance; (v) provide an \nasset registry for regional water supply schemes with more than 10,000 connections; and (vi) \ntrain NWSDB, project staff, CBOs, and communities for improved operation and maintenance \n(O&M) and scheme management. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n10.  The total cost of the Project\u2014including physical and price contingencies, taxes, and \nduties\u2014was originally estimated at $86.3 million equivalent. Tables 2 and 3 of the original report \nand recommendation of the President (RRP) for the project (footnote 1) summarize the original \ncost details and financing plan. ADB provided a loan of $60.3 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources with a maturity term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. It was \nestimated  that  the  ADB  loan  would  cover  approximately  70%  of  total  project  costs.  The \nGovernment was to provide $22.5 million equivalent (26.5% of total costs) and the community \nwas to provide $3.1 million equivalent (3.5% of total costs). The community contribution for the \nrural component was proposed to be 20% of the capital cost for each technical option. However, \nthe  initial  project  allocation  has  been  found  to  be  insufficient  to  achieve  the  proposed \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n11.  The Government, through a subsidiary financing agreement acceptable to ADB, made \nthe proceeds of the proposed loan available to NWSDB. The terms of this agreement were \ndefined as follows: (i) 85% of funding for water supply schemes in PSs is made available to \nNWSDB as a grant and 15% as a loan; (ii) for urban and municipal councils, 50% of funding is \nprovided as a grant and 50% as a loan; and (iii) for rural communities, 100% of funding is \nprovided as a grant. In each case, loan financing was made available at the rate of 10% per \nannum with a repayment period of 24 years and a grace period of 5 years. \n \nE.  Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n12.  Project implementation has been satisfactory to date. Despite some delays stemming \nfrom initial start-up and the tsunami, significant advancement has been achieved since loan \neffectiveness. This section reviews (i) component-based progress in project implementation, (ii) \nsafeguards  compliance,  and  (iii)  early  performance  in  achieving  benefits  and  impacts.  A \nsummary of subproject implementation for all three components is in Appendix 2. Compliance \nwith loan covenants is also adequate (Appendix 3). \n \n1.  Project Implementation \n13.  Urban Component. Topographical, geotechnical, and inundation surveys have been \ncompleted in all four towns. Construction of offices and staff quarters has been completed in \nHambantota,  Polonnaruwa,  and  Batticaloa.  Contracts  have  been  awarded  and  are  under \nconstruction for (i) strengthening and raising the bund for Unnichchai tank; (ii) supply and laying \nof the treated water transmission main from Ambalantota to Mirijjawila; (iii) Batticaloa Hospital \nsewerage  and  sewage  treatment;  and  (iv) Hambantota  headworks,  treatment  plant,  and \ntransmission pipeline. Major design-and-build contract packages have been tendered and are \ncurrently being evaluated for headworks, raw water mains, and a water treatment plant for \n ", "4   \nBatticaloa  and  Muttur.  Civil  works  contract  packages  for  elevated  towers  and  distribution \nsystems are under tendering or evaluation and are due to be awarded soon. Implementation is \ngenerally progressing effectively and undisrupted as most construction activities are in cleared \nareas. Safety aspects have been carefully considered throughout the entire cycle of detailed \ndesign,  construction  and  commissioning  and  project  management  structures  maintain  a \ncontinuous dialogue with Government agencies, key stakeholders and contractors. Construction \nof Matara\u2019s salinity barrier has been halted as a result of farmers\u2019 objection to inundation. \nCompensation  to  be  paid  is  3\u20134  times  the  cost  of  the  structure  itself,  making  this  option \nfinancially unviable.9  \n \n14.  Rural  Component.  Batch  1  subprojects  of  the  rural  component  have  completed \nplanning and more than 80% of all design activities. Construction of rural water supply and \nsanitation schemes was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005 and is expected to be completed \nin mid 2007. Approximately 40% of all contracts in 140 Grama Nilathari Divisions (GNDs) in \nAnuradhapura  and  Polonnaruwa  (batch  1  serves  four  PSs  in  Anuradhapura  and  three  in \nPolonnaruwa)10 have been awarded. Batch 1 for Batticaloa\u2019s rural component is at an advanced \nstage in the mobilization and planning process. Hygiene and sanitation campaigns have been \ndelivered for PSs under the first batch of activities. Design and implementation information on \nparticipatory  mechanisms  in  the  community  driven  rural  water  supply  component  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.11   \n \n15.  Institutional Strengthening. Targets for in-country training of project staff have been \nparticularly successful (270% participant attendance) but overseas project staff training only \nachieved 50% of its targets because of NWSDB restrictions on training of contractual staff. \nNational  public  awareness  and  education  campaign  activities  are  also  being  implemented \ngradually, with varying media coverage, tools under utilization, and targeted audience. Although \napproximately 9 months behind schedule implementation of the proposed NWSDB corporate \nstrategy-support component is progressing well. NWSDB program approval was obtained in \nJune  2005  and  NWSDB  is  monitoring  its  implementation  quarterly.  Financial  management \nstrengthening outputs are to be achieved through: (i) implementation of a resource allocation \nstrategy  with  performance-based  incentives,  and  (ii)  financial  management  improvement \nstrategies.  The  operational  efficiency  plan  is  to  reduce  O&M  costs  through:  (i)  a  training \ncomponent;  (ii)  enhancing  collection  performance  and  customer  satisfaction  by  upgrading \ncomputer  hardware  and  introduction  of  computer-assisted  bill  receiving  cashier  points; \n(iii) reducing  power  consumption  through  improved  plant  efficiency,  introduction  of  energy \nsaving measures, and systems to reduce energy losses; and (iv) improving institutional capacity \nfor repairs and maintenance. While the program for reduction of power consumption has been \nsuccessful, further efforts and resource allocation is needed for reducing non-revenue water.  \n \n2.  Safeguards Compliance Review \n16.  Environment. A review of environmental safeguards compliance is in Supplementary \nAppendix B. The assessment indicates that mitigation measures proposed in the original initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), as presented at appraisal, have been incorporated in design \nand initial construction activities. Bidding documents address environmental requirements, and \n                                                 \n9  NWSDB has proposed to appoint a special committee to study low-cost options for Matara for future implementation \nunder other projects. The Project has suspended all activities regarding this component. \n10  Batch 1 water supply activities in Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts are expected to benefit 26,400 \nhouseholds (HHs) while rural sanitation will improved the well-being of around 12,600 HHs in the same areas. \nBatch 2 is expected to support water supply activities of 35,400 HHs and sanitation for 13,200 HHs in six PSs.  \n11  Foundations  for  successful  implementation  of  the  rural  component  are  based  on  ADB.  1997.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila.  ", "  5\ndesign of packages has been conducted to minimize and/or prevent any impacts. Environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs) have been formulated for the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, \nMuttur,  and  Polonnaruwa.  Environmental  clearances  have  been  obtained  from  the  Central \nEnvironmental Authority (CEA) for all project activities except the Matara salinity barrier, which \nis  no  longer  needed.  Site  selection  in  Polonnaruwa  has  been  modified  to  ensure  that: \n(i) construction is situated at a safe distance from the archaeological zone; and (ii) the water \ntreatment plant site is in elevated land, preventing exposure and damage from flooding. A \nreview of project activities indicates that care has been taken in introducing and implementing \nrequired  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans.  Extensions  for  all  CEA \nenvironmental clearances, Wildlife Department clearance and water rights from the Mahaweli \nAuthority for Polonnaruwa\u2019s scheme have been obtained and NWSDB has recruited project-\nbased environmental officers to oversee environmental implementation during construction.  \n \n17.  Resettlement.  A  review  of  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nprocesses under the Project has revealed that activities for transferring government land are at \nan advanced stage. Of 21 parcels to be transferred, consent to construct has been received and \ninitial lease has been paid for 5 parcels, while consent to construct has been received for 11 \nparcels.  Project  infrastructure  can  also  be  constructed  in  the  3  NSWDB  parcels.  Land \nacquisition  procedures  have  also  been  initiated  for  private  land.  Because  of  project \nmodifications, private land to be acquired has increased from 1.40 hectares (ha), at appraisal, to \n1.94 ha. In accordance with the Government\u2019s National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement,12 NWSDB must ensure payment at replacement \ncosts  for  all  land  acquired\u2014even  for  a  transaction  completed  in  Muttur  not  meeting  this \nrequirement.  To  date,  through  its  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  in  Batticaloa,  NWSDB  has  initiated  the  implementation  of  the \ncompensation plan, and a preliminary list of affected persons (APs) has been drawn up. The \ndraft compensation plan for Unnichchai tank was prepared by NWSDB in June 2002, and was \nrevised13 and discussed at a meeting held on 11 October 2005 among 15 government-agency \nstakeholders and 4 representatives of the farmer\u2019s organization. However, as prescribed in the \ncompensation plan, finalization of the compensation plan requires extensive inputs from the \ncommittees (which should include all APs) with an independent and knowledgeable facilitator \nand this should be addressed in a timely manner.14  \n \n3.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n18.  Gender. The gender action plan for the Project promotes equal representation of women \nin  staff  and  project  and  partner  organizations,  and  ensures  the  involvement  of  women \nthroughout project development activities in all phases. Numerical targets set for the Project \nhave been met or exceeded.15 The target of 50% representation in CBOs has not yet been met \nbut is progressively increasing (25% in Anuradhapura and 40% in Polonnaruwa), including a \ngrowing number of women\u2019s organizations (62 in Anuradhapura and 75 in Polonnaruwa). To \nfacilitate  gender  and  development,  the  Project  has  initiated  activities  such  as:  (i)  initial \nparticipatory social assessments to understand women\u2019s roles; (ii) formation of groups and \norganizations for women, and ensuring women\u2019s representation in other groups; (iii) women \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1995.

Community  Participation.  The  rural  component  is  based  on  a  demand-driven \nparticipatory  approach  facilitated  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  where  the \nbeneficiaries organize in CBOs and collectively take responsibility for subproject implementation \nand O&M of water systems. Implementation of the first rural batch is at an advanced stage and \nits  approach  is  reported  to  be  highly  supported  and  well  accepted  by  CBOs.  Supporting \ndocuments have been prepared for selecting partner organizations, social mobilization and \ncommunity participatory planning process, conducting socioeconomic surveys, environmental \nconservation plans and hygiene and sanitation, participatory rural appraisals, and cost sharing. \nCommunity commitment and participation has been reflected not only through cash contribution \ntowards the overall provision of the schemes (20%) but also through active participation in \ndesign and site identification, provision of unskilled labor, and commitment to provide skilled \nlabor, wherever the Project can offer training opportunities.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOANS \nA.  Revised Cost Estimates \n20.  The revised total cost of the Project is estimated at $175.2 million equivalent, including \ntaxes, duties, interest charges on the ADB loans, and physical and price contingencies.

", "  7\nB.  The Cost Overrun \n21.  Price escalation factors and modifications in project design have resulted in an overall \ncost overrun. The project cost increase is $80.8 million, whereas the financing gap is estimated \nto be $88.8 million or approximately 100% of the original project cost.16 Factors and reasons \nleading to cost overrun in the Project include: (i) price increases, (ii) physical changes during \ndetailed  engineering  design,  (iii)  cost  underestimation  at  appraisal,  and  (iv)  increases  in \ngovernment  taxes  and  duties  for  goods  and  services.  Cost  comparisons  are  discussed  in \nAppendix 5 while detailed data are presented in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Overrun Evaluationa \n \nComponent  Cost Increase ($ million) \nPrice  Physical  Under- Taxes and  Total  % \nEscalation  Change  costing  Duties \nUrban Component  23.5  16.5  18.7  12.8  71.5  89 \nRural Component  4.3  0.0  0.0  1.2  5.5  7 \nInstitutional Strengthening  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0 \nProject Management  1.2  0.0  1.0  1.0  3.2  4 \n       Total  29.0  16.5  19.7   15.0  80.2  100 \n               %  36  21  24  19  100   \na Cost overrun is calculated from base cost and taxes, and excludes contingencies and interest. Marginal deviations     \n   from data reported elsewhere may arise from rounding up figures and slight differences in exchange rate (<1%). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  Cost  Increases  per  Component.  As  indicated  in  the  comparative  assessment \n(Table 1), the urban component has increased by 140% (and represents 89% of the cost \noverrun), but the rural component has only increased by 39% (7% of the cost overrun) and the \nproject management component has risen by just 28% (4% of the cost overrun). Most significant \ncost increases have been registered for the urban component, whereas the rural component \nwas less significantly affected. As shown in Table 2, the urban component has been affected by \na combination of price escalation, undercosting at appraisal, and physical changes.  \n \n23.  The  rural  component  is  a  sector-like  component.  As  such,  precise  design  was  not \nconducted  at  feasibility;  instead,  sample  subprojects  were  utilized  to  conduct  projections. \nDespite general increases in commodities (which correlate adequately with the overall increase \nin the component), the cost has largely been contained as a result of (i) communities being \nresponsible for undertaking civil works during construction, and (ii) partial activity redesigning to \nminimize capital expenditure while optimizing O&M costs.  \n \n24.  Increases in project management have resulted from requirements for (i) additional \nperson-months of supervision consultants, and (ii) PMU and PIU salaries and running costs. \nThe number of supervision consultants was minimized in the original project and later found to \nbe insufficient to properly implement the Project in a timely manner in four towns in different \ngeographical locations at the same time.17 Project management requirements are estimated to \nhave  caused  4%  of  the  cost  overrun.  Government  incremental  costs  have  resulted  from \nsubstantial increases in salary over the past 3 years.18  \n                                                 \n16  Given the advanced state of design and tendering, physical contingencies have been minimized. Based on recent \nhistorical data, allowance for price contingencies has been retained to accommodate contract price adjustments. \n17  While it was suggested that the supervision person-months deficit could be fulfilled with NWSDB staff, this has not \nproven possible because of (i) multiple commitments in the aftermath of the tsunami reconstruction process; \n(ii) NWSDB recruitment minimization; and (iii) operation in \u201cdifficult\u201d areas attracting a smaller number of skilled \nstaff, often at additional premium rates. \n18  NWSDB has reviewed its human resources strategy and conducted a salary review and realignment.   \n ", "8   \n25.  Cost Overrun per Category. Further evaluation of the cost overrun has shown that civil \nworks are the largest base cost category, increasing by $38.5 million or 100% increase over the \noriginal civil works allocation (these still represent 58% of the base cost and 58% of the total \ncost overrun). Goods and equipment follows, increasing by $25 million or 175% increase over \nthe original equipment allocation (representing 38% of the total cost overrun and a category \nincrease in base cost from 23% to 30%); consulting services, increasing by $1 million or 2% of \nthe total cost overrun; and incremental staff and recurring costs, increasing by $1.2 million or \n2% of the total cost overrun. Taxes and duties, increasing by 15 million or 19% of the total cost \noverrun, will be covered by counterpart contributions. \n \n26.  Price Escalation. Price factors contributing to cost escalation have two main sources: \n(i) a notable rise in international market rates for construction materials, and (ii) price escalation \nresulting from the post-tsunami construction boom. Price escalation data related to construction \nmaterials is in Appendix 5. A review of NWSDB national book rates and rates of the Sri Lanka \nInstitute of Construction, Training and Development indicates a significant cost increase in basic \nconstruction material. The price of goods sourced from international markets (such as oil, steel, \niron, and copper) rose almost continuously for the entire 2002\u20132006 period. Prices were further \naffected by increases in locally available resources such as sand and labor.19 Pre-tsunami price \nincreases (2001\u20132004) averaged 10-30% per year, depending on international markets. The \ntsunami  disaster  exacerbated  the  situation  by  distorting  local  market  conditions  through \nincreased reconstruction activity, shortage of supplies, and demand for services. In addition to \nhigh  demand  for  materials  and  labor  for  the  reconstruction  process,  the  tsunami  delayed \nsurveying activities and other essential studies that marginally impacted the readiness of the \ndesign. 20 The overall compounded cost overrun caused by price escalation is estimated around \n36%.21 While price contingencies were provided under the original design (11.5% of base cost), \nthese are insufficient to accommodate foreign and local cost increases.22 \n \n27.  Cost Underestimation at Appraisal. Project costing at appraisal was conducted on the \nbasis of the 2001 NWSDB book rates, which are prepared based on recent and/or previous year \ncontract awards and market rates for ongoing projects. During this period (2001-2002), NWSDB \nbook rates did not incorporate contract experience in water supply and sanitation projects in the \nNorth-East Province, as no such projects were under implementation. Consequently, the rates \nused at appraisal were found to be insufficient. Based on contract-award experience for 2003\u2013\n2006, underestimation resulting from failure to consider risk factors at appraisal (2002) has been \nevaluated  to  have  caused  around  10-15%  of  the  total  cost  overrun. 23  In  addition, \nunderestimation at appraisal has been associated with the use of NWSDB rates, which have \nbeen found to be generally insufficient (15\u201320% below market rates, depending on the item). \nUndercosting of the original project is estimated to be the cause of 24% of the cost overrun.  \n \n28.  Increases in Taxes and Duties. Taxes and duties for goods and services, including \nvalue  added  tax  and  custom  duties,  were  underestimated  at  appraisal  (by  $10  million  in \n                                                 \n19  Sample price increases during 2002\u20132006 include: (i) steel (120%), (ii) pipes (around 40% for PVC pipes and 60\u2013\n90% for ductile iron pipes), (iii) electromechanical equipment (100%), (iv) sand (about 200%), and (v) cement \n(45%). High oil prices, which increased by about 60\u201390%, also led to increased manufacturing, shipping, and \ntransportation costs. Labor costs are reported to have increased significantly; NWSDB rates suggest an average \nincrease of 50\u201360% for unskilled and skilled labor. \n20 Given time requirements to complete detailed engineering design, contracts could not have been awarded before \nthe tsunami.  \n21  This figure is consistent with general compounded inflation levels of around 46% over 2001\u20132005. The slightly \nlower value correlates directly with currency devaluation (approximately 8% since original appraisal). \n22  Price contingencies were estimated at appraisal at an annual factor of 2.4% for both foreign and local costs.   \n23  Factors having been quoted to be at the origin of increasing costs include, remoteness, difficulty of access and \nincreased insurance costs associated with security matters.  ", "  9\nabsolute value). In addition, an increase in project cost has led to a rise in taxes and duties (by \n$5 million in absolute value). The total value represents an increase of 215% from the originally \nagreed value and 19% equivalent of the cost overrun. Financing for additional taxes and duties \nwill remain part of the Government\u2019s counterpart contribution under the supplementary loans.   \n \n29.  Cost Increase caused by Changes in Project Design. The overall cumulative cost \noverrun  caused  by  changes  during  detailed  engineering  design  is  estimated  around  21%. \nPhysical contingencies provided under the original design (amounting to approximately 10% of \nthe base cost) are insufficient to accommodate costs increases for these changes. Design \nmodifications were introduced following completion of hydrological, water quality, topographical, \ngeotechnical, inundation, and environmental surveys and have been discussed in paras. 30\u201331. \n \nC.  Proposed Physical Changes within Existing Project Scope \n30.  Depending  on  the  project  town,  surveys  indicated  the  need  to:  (i) resize  intake \nstructures,  (ii)  revise  electromechanical  arrangements  and  piping  material,  (iii) provide  full \nconventional water treatment, and (iv) provide adequate foundations to overcome potential land \nsubsidence. Such changes were introduced to ensure that: (i) required drinking water quality \nlevels are achieved in accordance with national and World Health Organization standards; (ii) \nwater quantity in project towns is sufficient and extracted at sustainable rates; and (iii) full \ncompliance with safety requirements, environment, and social safeguards is secured. Since \nthree of the four project towns were significantly impacted by the tsunami, the design was \nadapted, incorporating modifications and marginal scope changes for (i) buffer zoning, and (ii) \nwater supply to tsunami settlements. Physical changes and modifications in design are detailed \nin Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n31.  The most significant cost increases were incurred in Polonnaruwa (52% scheme cost \nincrease caused by design changes) following a forced change in intake location from the \nproposed Parakarama Samudra source to the Mahaweli.24 The revised design for the water \nsupply scheme required (i) a new intake (instead of augmenting the existing one); (ii) increased \npumping requirements, length and size of transmission lines; and (ii) new and more complex \nwater treatment facilities. In Hamabantota, cost increases caused by design changes have \nresulted from an increase in intake size, revisions to design to accommodate and optimize the \nsimultaneous operation of three water treatment plants, and revisions on piping material to \nwithstand internal and external pressures. In Muttur, changes introduced will compensate poor \nsubsoil conditions and ensure the safety of the public, workers, and equipment. In Batticaloa, \ndesign modifications include treatment against blue-green algae toxicants, and revisions to \nelectromechanical works to minimize O&M costs. In Matara, inundation surveys revealed that \nthe  construction  of  its  single  subcomponent,  a  salinity  barrier,  would  require  significant \ncompensation\u2014amounting to approximately $12 million\u2014so the subproject is no longer viable. \nPhysical changes in design often arose from factors that could not have been addressed at the \nfeasibility stage, especially as surveys conducted during this period were restricted by local \nsecurity conditions in the North-East Province. Despite the above changes, the number of \nbeneficiaries is estimated to remain largely unchanged. \n \nD.  Impact on the Project \n32.  In the absence of supplementary loans, the Project will be unable to meet its original \nobjectives.  In  particular,  the  urban  component  could  not  be  accomplished,  depriving  an \n                                                 \n24  The preliminary design recommended and agreed with the North Central provincial irrigation department for full \nwater extraction was to be sourced from the Parakrama Samudra tank (signed memorandum of understanding in \n2002). However, the irrigation department later contested the agreement, leading to the suspension of this option. \n ", "10  \nestimated population of up to 250,000 (out of 575,000) of water. 25 The cost overrun would \nprevent at least one of the four towns (and up to three, depending on the final scope) from \nreceiving a water supply scheme. Similarly, the rural component may have to be revised and the \nnumber  of  beneficiaries  may  have  to  be  reduced  by  about  100,000.  The  institutional \nstrengthening component, operating under the original budget, is expected to be able to meet its \nobjectives with current resource allocations.   \n \n33.  Because of the reasons outlined above, cost overruns have been generally reported in \nconstruction operations, including the water supply and sanitation sector. NWSDB remains \nengaged in the design and implementation of urban and rural water supply and sanitation, \nespecially since the importance of this sector was renewed and emphasized after the tsunami \nneeds assessment. NWSDB is responsible for the implementation of an increasing number of \nforeign-assisted  projects.  However,  its  capacity,  in  terms  of  resources  and  counterpart \nallocations, remains adequate. The PMU and PIUs are operating satisfactorily and executing \nand implementing agencies are operating within their mandate. An outline capacity assessment \nof the executing agency (EA) is summarized in Appendix 7. The revised design is considered to \nbe the best possible option for all four towns, and physical changes and modifications within the \noriginal scope are expected to optimize operation while reducing maintenance costs. Design \nmodifications have also catered for improved safety measures, accessibility, and environmental \nprotection. Although the objectives of the overall Project remain generally aligned to those \nreported  in  the  original  project  RRP  (footnote  1),  a  revised  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 8. \n \nE.  Rationale for Supplementary Loans \n34.  Alignment with Government and ADB Priorities. Provision of safe drinking water \nthrough construction of new schemes and augmentation of existing ones represents a major \nmilestone in the Government\u2019s New Development Strategy and is therefore a  government \npriority.  The  Project  continues  to  be  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote \nregionally  balanced  development,  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  conflict-affected  areas, \nreducing poverty and providing equitable development. The supplementary loans will assist the \nGovernment in delivering the originally defined development objectives and, in addition, support \nthe tsunami rehabilitation process in three major secondary towns in Sri Lanka. The Project is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2004\u20132008)26 and its updates.  \n \n35.  Alignment with Government and ADB Policies. Physical changes within the original \nscope have been assessed, along with their impacts in the context of current ADB policies.27 \nNew and revised policies, approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors since appraisal of the original \nproject, have been considered. Technical, capacity and institutional assessments and economic \nand financial analyses of the revised Project have been conducted. All steps in the matrix of due \ndiligence have been observed. The revised Project is technically feasible, institutionally sound, \neconomically viable, and financially sustainable (subject to tariff revisions).  \n \n36.  Compliance with Safeguards Requirements. Ongoing  and modified activities have \nbeen reviewed for compliance with safeguards and shown to be sound with regard to ADB\u2019s \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 policies.  \n \n                                                 \n25 Despite  dialogue  with  various  funding  agencies,  bilateral  aid  partners  are  unable  to  commit  the  required \nsupplementary funds to this Project. The Government has also informed ADB that it is unable meet the entire \nproject funding gap.  \n26  ADB. 2003. Sri Lanka: Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008). Manila \n27  ADB. 2005. A Review of the Policy on Supplementary Financing: Addressing Challenges and Broader Needs. Manila. ", " 11\n37.  Timing.  Despite  delays  associated  with  the  tsunami,  progress  to  date  has  been \nsatisfactory. Processing of supplementary loans should not be delayed because: (i) detailed \nengineering design is almost complete and figures are expected to remain largely unchanged; \n(ii) processing and loan effectiveness require several months, despite streamlining procedures \nintroduced with revisions to the supplementary financing policy; (iii) the Project\u2019s cost overrun \nhas been weighed against contracts awarded under this and other NWSDB projects over the \npast 6 months, indicating no expected \u201csavings\u201d; and (iv) if supplementary loans were not \nprovided, the project would have insufficient funds to award contracts by the end of 2006.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n38.  Involuntary Resettlement. A short resettlement plan (SRP) was prepared by the EA \n(NWSDB) during project appraisal, in accordance with the Government\u2019s National Involuntary \nResettlement Policy28 and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (footnote 12). The SRP \nhad two parts: (i) addressing temporary loss of livelihood for farmers, laborers, and fishers \naffected by lowering water levels in the Unnichchai tank during tank strengthening and level \naugmentation; and (ii) addressing resettlement impacts resulting from permanent acquisition of \n10.0 ha of land, of which NWSDB owns 1.1 ha, other government agencies own 7.5 ha, and \nprivate individuals own 1.4 ha. The current project design will have the same impacts on the \ntemporary  loss  of  livelihood  for  farmers,  laborers,  and  fishers  affected  by  lowering  water \ndischarge levels in the Unnichchai tank, as civil works are conducted. Since there will be no \nchanges in the resettlement impact for raising the Unnichchai tank, the existing compensation \nplan will be followed to address the temporary loss of livelihood. However, while physical \nchanges in project design have been conceptualized to avoid involuntary resettlement and \nminimize impacts, a revised SRP is required to: (i) ensure the replacement of housing structures \nfor NWSDB staff; (ii) compensate for structures, such as wells and trees, with commercial value; \n(iii) ensure that vulnerable persons are identified and provided with additional compensation, \nand (iv) address temporary impacts. The revised SRP is in Supplementary Appendix G and its \nsummary is in Appendix 9. \n \n39.  Environment.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy,29 the  Project  is  classified  as \nenvironmental category B. As part of due diligence, proposed physical changes within the \noriginal design have been screened for safeguard significance and found to be within the \noriginal project categorization. IEEs incorporating detailed engineering design changes have \nbeen formulated for Batticaloa and Polonnaruwa; original IEEs for Hambantota and Muttur have \nbeen found to adequately address potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures. \nThe Project has renewed all environmental clearances from the CEA. A revised and updated \nsummary  IEE  (SIEE)  has  been  formulated  to  encapsulate  the  findings  and  requirements \noutlined  in  original  and  revised  environmental  documents  prepared  during  project \nimplementation. The new SIEE (Supplementary Appendix H) shows that none of the proposed \ncomponents  will  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Anticipated  minor \nenvironmental impacts not included in the original design include dust generation caused by \nexcavation activities, increased vibrations resulting from rock drilling, land subsidence because \nof poor soil conditions, and minor disturbance of the lagoon bed in Batticaloa during pipe-laying \noperations. Environmental impacts have been minimized through appropriate design and site \nlocation,  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  to  prevent  or  minimize \nimpacts resulting from construction and operation.  \n \n40.  Indigenous Peoples. The Project was classified as category C for indigenous peoples \nsafeguards  under  the  original  loan.  Although  the  Project  incorporates  a  mixture  of  Tamil, \n                                                 \n28  Ministry of Land Development. 2001. National Involuntary Resettlement Policy.

Consequently, the revised detailed \nengineering design is expected to benefit all groups equally.  \n \nG.  Revised Financing Plan \n41.  A loan of $60.3 million equivalent was originally allocated from ADB\u2019s Special Fund \nresources. In addition, supplementary loans for $46.5 million equivalent will be provided from \nADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF) and $13.5 million equivalent will be provided from ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) to finance the Project. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, conversion options in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere  the  Government\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. Table 3 summarizes the revised financing plan. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million)  \nSource  Total  Percentage\nAsian Development Bank  120.3  69a \n  ADF \u2013 original allocation  60.3   \n  ADF \u2013 supplementary allocation  46.5   \n  OCR \u2013 supplementary allocation  13.5   \nGovernment  51.8  30 \n  Government contribution (for ADF loan)\u2013 original allocation  18.6   \n  Government contribution (for ADF loan)\u2013 supplementary allocation  24.7   \n  Government contribution (for OCR loan) \u2013 supplementary allocation  8.5   \nCommunity  3.1  1 \n          Total  175.2  100 \nADF = ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources; OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na This is below the current cost sharing limit for Sri Lanka of 75%.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n42.  ADF and OCR loans will cover 69% of the total project cost.30 It is proposed that the \nOCR  loan  will  finance  the  water  scheme  in  Polonnaruwa.  Interest  during  the  project \nimplementation period will be capitalized. The Government will provide a total of $51.8 million \nequivalent  (30%  of  the  total  project  cost)  to  finance  taxes  and  duties,  resettlement,  land \nacquisition, and part of civil works and equipment. Communities will provide about $3.1 million \nequivalent for civil works as equity contribution to rural water supply and sanitation schemes. \nADF resources for supplementary loans will be provided from a variety of sources, including: (i) \nthe reallocation of $18.5 million equivalent in ADF resources from unutilized loan proceeds of \nclosed loans to the Government, and (ii) a new $28.0 million equivalent ADF allocation. New \n                                                 \n30  For each of the three loans, ADB will finance eligible expenditures in accordance with ratios specified for each cost \ncategory in Appendix 4, Table A4.2. Financing of ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Towns \nand Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila is as per the original loan agreement. The \nnew ADF loan will finance 67% of total expenditure in civil works, 76% for equipment and materials (exclusive of \ntaxes and duties), and 100% of the interest charge; the OCR loan will finance 62% of total expenditure in civil works, \n70% for equipment and materials (exclusive of taxes and duties),  and 100% of the interest and commitment charges.   ", " 13\nloan and project agreements will be prepared for both ADF and OCR loans. Repayments of \nsupplementary loans will be synchronized with those of the original loan. The Government will \ncontinue to make available counterpart financing in a timely manner, including the additional \n$33.2 million equivalent in counterpart resources required for the supplementary loans.  \n \n43.  Subsidiary Loan Agreements. The Government will make loan proceeds available to \nNWSDB as a grant and a loan through new subsidiary financing agreements acceptable to \nADB. The ratio of grant and loan is expected to be determined based on urban and rural \npopulation ratios in project areas. Based on the subsidiary financing agreement of the original \nproject signed between NWSDB and the Government: (i) 85% of funding for water supply \nschemes in PSs will be made available to NWSDB as a grant and 15% as a loan; (ii) for \nschemes in urban and municipal councils, 50% of funding will be provided as a grant and 50% \nas a loan; and (iii) for rural water supply and sanitation systems implemented by communities, \n100% of funding will be provided as a grant. The subsidiary loan from the Government to \nNWSDB will have an interest rate of 10% with a 24-year term, including a 5-year grace period.   \n \nH.  Loan Savings and Utilization of Surplus Loan Proceeds \n44.  As  part  of  its  loan  portfolio  review  in  2006,  ADB  and  the  Government  identified \n$37.6 million  in  surplus  loan  savings  from  seven  ongoing  projects  in  the  country.31 Given \nexisting  constraints  on  ADF  resources,  and  in  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  revised  policy  on \nsupplementary financing (footnote 27), the Government has requested the reallocation of loan \nsavings  from  four  loans32 where  activities  are  completed  or  loan  proceeds  are  no  longer \nnecessary for completion of the projects (Appendix 10). Since project completion dates for all \nfour captioned loans are foregone, changes in scope or implementation arrangements are not \nrequired. As indicated in para. 42, it is proposed that surplus loan proceeds be utilized to \nfinance part of the ADF supplementary loan for this Project and that reallocation be conducted \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions (PAIs).33 If the Board approves the proposed \nuse of surplus loan proceeds, then the director general, acting under the authority provided in \nthe PAIs,34 will be deemed to have approved the cancellation of surplus loan proceeds from the \nfour loans. The captioned loans will be closed, savings reallocated and cancelled on the same \ndate, which will coincide with the new ADF loan effectiveness date. \n \nI.  Remedial Steps35 \n45.  Reliable Costing. To minimize errors resulting from inadequate estimates, latest costs \n(i)  have  been  conducted  using  2006  market  rates,  which  accommodate  post-tsunami \nconstruction boom price increases and incorporate experience from ongoing contract packages \n                                                 \n31  Memorandum of Understanding: Review of ADB Lending Portfolio in Sri Lanka, August 2006 (Supplementary \nAppendix I). \n32  Proposed loan savings amount to SDR12.56 million (about $18.56 million equivalent) and include: (i) ADB. 1997. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Upper Watershed Management Project. Manila (Loan 1545-SRI, savings of \nSDR2.62 million); (ii) ADB. 1997.

Price  Contingencies.  Price  contingencies  have  been  maintained  to  accommodate \nvariable price contracts. ADB guidelines for estimating price contingencies have been applied \nand factors conform to ADB\u2019s recommendations for Sri Lanka to account for inflation and \ncurrency depreciation factors.   \n  \n47.  Timely Implementation. To prevent further cost overruns, it is essential for the Project \nto minimize any delays in implementation and construction activities. For this purpose, the PMU \nwill  continue  to  update  the  existing  critical  path  method  diagrams  as  part  of  the  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS), and recruit required staff and consultancy services in a \ntimely manner. Project activities are expected to be completed no later than 6\u20139 months after \nthe originally approved closing date.  \n \nJ.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n48.  It is proposed that NWSDB, under MUDWS, will be the EA for supplementary loans (as \nfor the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project). \nThe PMU, established in Colombo under NWSDB to support the original project, will be the \nPMU  for  the  supplementary  loans.  Existing  PIUs,  PS  implementation  units  (PSIUs),  and \ntechnical  support  units  under  the  original  project  will  support  implementation  under  the \nsupplementary loans. Policy and strategic decisions and PMU guidance (as for the original \nproject) will be provided by the existing national steering committee chaired by the secretary of \nMUDWS, and coordination for the rural PSIUs will be provided by the coordinating committee \nestablished in the North Central provincial council. Where necessary, additional complementary \nproject coordinating committees will be established at the district, divisional, and village levels. \nThe rural water supply section of NWSDB will continue to act as the technical advisory unit for \nthe rural component, providing support to the technical support units and PSIUs, whilst the \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Division in MUD&WS will provide policy guidance to PMU, \nprovincial project coordinating committee, project support units, and PSIUs, and monitor policy \nimplementation  of  this  component.  For  maximum  resource  efficiency,  TSUs  and  PIUs  in \nPolonnaruwa and Batticaloa share facilities and, wherever relevant and necessary, knowledge \nand expertise. Based on implementation and capacity development progress, and the financial \nmanagement systems assessment (Appendix 7), financial management arrangements for the \nsupplementary loans are regarded as satisfactory. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n49.  The  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nProject is to be implemented over 6 years and the expected completion date is March 2009. \nSince few delays have been incurred because of delayed loan effectiveness and the tsunami, \nthe proposed supplementary loans are expected to be implemented in parallel with the main \nproject activities, with a revised completion date no later than 31 December 2009 (Appendix 11). \n  \n3.  Procurement \n50.  Goods and services financed by the ADB loans have been and will be procured in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines, as amended from time to time. Urban water \nsupply schemes are to be built according to procurement packages agreed by the Inception \nMission for the original project, which include design-and-build contracts and supply-and-lay ", " 15\npackages for international competitive bidding (ICB) 36 and national competitive bidding (NCB). \nBefore any new procurement activity begins under NCB, ADB and the Borrower will review the \nBorrower\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines 37  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2006).  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  will  be  reflected  in  the \nprocurement plan. Civil works contracts valued over $2.5 million equivalent and equipment \ncontracts valued above $500,000 equivalent will be undertaken through ICB procedures. Civil \nworks  contracts  valued  at  $2.5  million  equivalent  or  less  will  be  carried  out  under  NCB \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Equipment packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less will \nbe procured following NCB. All construction works for the rural component remain valued at less \nthan $1 million equivalent, so they will be procured through NCB or, in the case of contracts \nvalued at less than SLRs5 million (approximately $50,000 equivalent), they will be procured by \nCBOs following procedures for community participation in procurement acceptable to ADB. The \ncurrent  status  and  proposed  amendments  to  the  procurement  packages  for  the  urban \ncomponent are in Appendix 12 and a procurement plan is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n51.  In addition to consulting services provided under the original project, it is envisaged that \nan  additional  1,500  person-months  of  national  supervisory  staff  inputs  will  be  required  to \nsupervise  the  contractors'  simultaneous  work  sites  under  the  Project.  The  additional \nrequirements are based on organizational needs for adequate supervision of all contracts, \nincluding four design-and-build and 12 bills-of-quantity type contracts; and design of the salinity \nbarrier at Hambantota intake under the Project. A detailed assessment of the nature and time \ninputs of required additional consultants is in Appendix 13.  \n \n52.  Two  firms  were  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2002) to support the original Project and included (ii) package A, for management \nsupport  for  the  PMU,  and  (ii)  package  B,  for  design  and  construction  supervision  of  the \nengineering works. The consulting firms were engaged by NWSDB using the quality and cost \nbased selection method. The proposed additional consultant inputs for design and supervision \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006), as \namended  from  time  to  time,  through  the  single  source  selection  method  with  the  firm  for \npackage B. Single source selection is considered the most appropriate and advantageous \nmethod of selection for the Government and the Project, as proposed tasks represent a natural \ncontinuation of previous work. Extending the services of the firm already engaged for package B \nis expected to result in time savings, minimum disruption of ongoing activities, and the use of \nthe most competitive rates already agreed with the firm which won the contract through the \nquality and cost based selection process. The firm will be requested to provide a biodata \ntechnical proposal for review and negotiation by NWSDB and ADB. The terms of reference and \nqualification  requirements  for  consultants  will  follow  the  original  contract.  No  additional \nconsulting staff will be provided for package A under supplementary loans. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n53.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998), as amended from time to time, was explained to and \ndiscussed with MUDWS and NWSDB. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \n                                                 \n36  Since this is an ongoing Project, contracts for goods and services have been tendered and/or awarded following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2004), consequently domestic preference has been and should continue to be \napplied  for  consistency  purposes.  From  1  April  2006,  all  procurement  is  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006), as amended from time to time. Appendix 12 contains details. \n37  National Procurement Agency. 2006. Procurement Guidelines (Goods and Works). Colombo  \n ", "16  \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Measures to Enhance Governance and Prevent Corruption  \n54.  The Project will introduce additional38 specific measures to enhance governance and \nprevent corruption. The measures include: (i) continued consultant support to PMU staff on \nprocurement, training, and financial management; (ii) continued use of information technology to \nincrease transparency, accountability, and efficiency; and (iii) ensuring that all representation \nletters are shared with ADB and attended to within 3 weeks of receipt (for this purpose, NWSDB \nwill develop relevant standard operating procedures). It is also recommended for audit systems \nto be strengthened (internally through the audit committee and externally through the Auditor \nGeneral). Adherence to codes of conduct by management and employees will be sought.  \n \n55.  Specific  measures  adopted  to  enhance  transparency  under  the  Project  include: \n(i) random and independent spot checks by ADB review missions on procurement and accounts \nof the Project; (ii) public disclosure through the NWSDB or project website of information on \n(a) bidding procedures, bidders, and contract awards for the Project; and (b) use of the funds \ndisbursed under the Project; (iii) involvement of beneficiaries in monitoring and evaluation of \nproject implementation; and (iv) the process of selection and approval of rural PSs will be made \nin a transparent manner, allowing the community in project areas to access such information. \nProposed measures to enhance managerial and procurement capacity include: (i) in the case of \ncontractor  prequalification,  the  PMU  will  undertake  a  process  of  verification  to  meet  the \nspecified qualification criteria, making the results available on the website; (ii) tender capacity \nwill be mandatory criteria for award of contracts; and (iii) strict review of implementation and \nevaluation of the institutional strengthening component under the Project to determine the level \nof operational performance and financial management improvement within NWSDB.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n56.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds, collecting supporting documents, and preparing \nwithdrawal applications and sending them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook39 as amended from time to time. To facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and \ncounterpart funds and to expedite project implementation, the Government will, immediately \nafter loans are effective, open and maintain separate and new project imprest accounts, one for \nthe ADF supplementary loan and another for the OCR supplementary loan, with the Central \nBank of Sri Lanka for NWSDB, to be managed by the PMU. The initial advances to the imprest \naccounts will not at any time exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures to be paid from \nthe imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The \nPMU will be responsible for ensuring that all imprest accounts are established, managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and with \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures \n(SOE) procedures will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The maximum \n                                                 \n38  Corruption prevention structures in Sri Lanka include (i) the Bribery Commission, (ii) the Consultative Committee of \nthe Parliament, and (iii) the institution of the Auditor General (indirectly). In addition, procurement systems \nincorporate anticorruption and transparency elements as reflected in the (i) Guidelines on Government Tender \nProcedures, and (ii) Procurement Support Bureau, which nominates tender evaluation committees. \n39  ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila ", " 17\npayments permitted under the SOE for both first generation imprest accounts is $100,000 per \npayment. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n57.  The Government will continue to provide ADB with monthly notes and quarterly progress \nreports on project implementation which follow ADB standard procedures. Accounts, SOEs, and \nrevenues related to the supplementary loans will be audited annually and separately by auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The annual audit, regularly complied with under the original project, will \ninclude the audit of the imprest accounts and SOEs procedure. A separate audit opinion on the \nuse of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure will be included in the annual audit report. As \nto date, audited project accounts and financial statements, together with the reports of the \nauditor,  will  continue  to  be  submitted  through  the  PMU  in  a  timely  manner.  However,  in \nagreement with ADB\u2019s latest policies, these will be submitted within 6 months after the end of \neach  financial  year.  The  PMU  will  also  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  the  physical \ncompletion of the Project, a project completion report following standard ADB procedures. \n \n9.  Project Review and Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n58.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  project  reviews  to  assess \nprogress, and a comprehensive midterm review in the fourth quarter of 2006. The project review \nwill follow standard ADB procedures. The Government will ensure that the midterm reviewers \nare informed of any policy or implementation changes affecting local government and the urban \ninfrastructure  sector.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  finalize  implementation  arrangements;  (ii) \nassess  implementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iii)  review  and  establish \ncompliance with loan covenants; and (iv) identify problems and constraints and, if necessary, \nrecommend changes to ensure the expeditious implementation of the Project. As for the original \nloan, benefit monitoring and evaluation will be assessed through (i) targets established by the \noperation  plan  for  the  next  fiscal  year  to  be  prepared  by  the  Government  and  the  local \ngovernments by 31 December of the previous year and (ii) the PPMS procedures. As part of the \nPPMS, the use and reporting of the critical path method will be continued and reported during \nsemiannual review missions (see Supplementary Appendix K).   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n59.  Benefits, impacts, and risks identified for the original project continue to be relevant.40 A \nsummary of these and additional risks associated with supplementary loans follows. \n \nA.  Expected Project Benefits and Impacts \n60.  Poverty Reduction and Improved Quality of Life. Lack of basic infrastructure and \nsocial  services  exacerbates  income  and  non-income  poverty,  particularly  in  project  towns \naffected by the tsunami. The Project is expected to impact on public health, reducing the high \nincidence of intestinal parasite and waterborne diseases caused by poor sanitation and lack of \nsafe water. This benefit will accrue especially to infants and children, who are more vulnerable. \nThe Project will reduce the time women spend fetching water and taking care of children \nsuffering from waterborne diseases, and the burden of carrying heavy loads. The Project will \ncontinue to pursue the gender action plan\u2019s specific targets, enhancing women\u2019s role and \nparticipation in the sector. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14.  \n \n                                                 \n40  The number of beneficiaries and expected benefits remains largely unchanged. Based on revised projections for \nproject areas, the number of beneficiaries, initially estimated at around 969,000 people, is expected to be 946,000. \n ", "18  \n61.  Supporting the Peace Process. The Project supports peace building. Water represents \nan essential good and provides a common purpose for interaction among communities. The \nProject will continue to assist reconstruction and development in areas affected by decades of \nconflict, and includes specific aspects aimed to address the needs of conflict-affected poor. \n \n62.  Social Participation. The Project\u2019s rural component provides a unique opportunity for \nsupporting inclusive social development and strengthening local government. Communities will \nbe  engaged  throughout  the  entire  cycle\u2014including  planning,  design,  construction,  and \nmanagement stages\u2014leading to enhanced ownership and accountability among beneficiaries. \nThe Project will continue to provide beneficiaries with training opportunities and experience in \nproject and financial management, and communities will gain skills to initiate other activities. \n \n63.  Environmental  Sustainable  Development. Towns supported under the Project are \nlocated in Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cdry zone\u201d. The Project will support water extraction from sustainable \nsources, limiting pressures on groundwater resources; and incorporate measures to prevent \nsalinity intrusion and protect ecosystems. The Project will also provide improved sanitation and, \nin the case of Batticaloa, sewage treatment facilities preventing indiscriminate discharge of raw \nsewage into adjacent lagoons. Lagoon and river protection is expected to yield direct benefits \non downstream ecosystems and, since primary fishing activities engage a significant part of the \nlabor force, protecting fisheries is a central activity for proposed poverty strategies.  \n \n64.  Economic Benefits and Financial Sustainability. Economic and financial analyses \nwere carried out for each water supply scheme in four towns (Supplementary Appendixes L, M, \nand N). Economic benefits for water supply were quantified and the economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  was  found  to  be  highest  in  Batticaloa  (12.1%),  followed  by  Muttur  (8.8%), \nPolonnaruwa (7.9%), and Hambantota (6.2%) in order of economic viability. For the four water \nsupply  schemes  combined,  the  overall  EIRR  is  estimated  at  9.8%.  As  agreed  with  the \nGovernment, financial sustainability of the urban schemes constructed under the Project will be \nsecured through the revision of tariffs to cover full O&M throughout the life of the schemes41 \n(para.69).  This  is  consistent  with  NWSDB\u2019s  recent  policy  commitments  to  establish  tariffs \ncapable  of  recovering:  (i)  O&M,  debt  service,  and  depreciation  for  all  schemes  within  the \ncountry; and (ii) scheme-specific O&M. Sustainability of the rural schemes has been secured \nthrough: (i) CBO signed agreements to operate and maintain all schemes; and (ii) extensive \nCBO capacity development activities, which include O&M,  management, and financial and \naccounting training during construction and operation phases. \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n65.  Political Stability. The success of the Project in meeting its goal continues to assume a \nstable political environment. Disruption of the peace process may delay project implementation \nin Batticaloa and Muttur. ADB will continue to monitor the security situation, ensuring that the \nhighest levels of safety, as determined by the United Nations, are applied. The PMU  will \ncontinue  to  monthly  brief  ADB  on  the  progress  of  each  of  the  packages,  immediately \nhighlighting any disruption associated to security matters. The Project will continue to implement \nspecific  mitigation  measures  proven  effective  to  date,  including:  (i)  careful  monitoring,  (ii) \npreferred recruitment of district-based qualified PIU/TSU staff, (iii) continued dialogue with all \nstakeholders and aid partners, (iv) fully participatory and transparent implementation including \ndisclosure of financial information, (v) mobilizing strong community support and trust in the \nproject staff, and (vi) encouraging local employment under Project contracts. \n \n                                                 \n41  A 48% tariff nominal increase would be required to achieve this objective by 2007. Alternatively, nominal tariff \nincreases of 20% in 2007, 15% in 2008, and 15% in 2009 would allow NWSDB to have a positive balance sheet by \n2010, when project schemes will be completed. ", " 19\n66.  Economic Growth and Financial Viability. The Project assumes that the country\u2019s \neconomy will continue to develop. The financial viability of each water supply scheme continues \nto hinge on tariff revision over the construction and design period. To ensure the financial \nviability of each water supply scheme, a real increase in tariff is required for average and two \nlowest consumer slabs. The financial viability of the Project assumes revisions to the national \nwater supply tariff by NWSDB to cover O&M of the project schemes, and, in agreement with \nnational policy, debt service and depreciation for all schemes in the country. \n \n67.  Reduced  Competition. Given accessibility conditions, few contractors may express \ninterest in proposed packages, potentially resulting in collusion among these. Ensuring that \ntenders are widely advertised in Sri Lanka and overseas may be partially offset this risk. \n \n68.  Personnel  Turnover.  As  a  result  of  the  tsunami  reconstruction  boom,  the  project \nmanagement structure has seen fast turnover of personnel. NWSDB\u2019s new salary increase \npolicy and gradually reducing reconstruction activity is likely to lead to more stable conditions. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances and assurances set forth in the Loan Agreement \n(Special Operations) of 18 August 2003 between the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \nand ADB, and the Project Agreement of even date between NWSDB and ADB, both for the \nSecondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,  the \nGovernment and NWSDB have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the \nlegal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that during each year of the project implementation, \nadequate budgetary allocations of required counterpart funds will be made and \nreleased  by  the  relevant  authorities  on  a  timely  and  regular  basis  by  31 \nDecember. \n(ii)   The Government and NWSDB will ensure (and NWSDB will obtain Government \nassurance from the Land Acquisition Section) that all land, land rights, rights-of \nway, and other land-related rights, and all water and water-related rights for the \nProject are acquired and the payment of replacement costs for land acquired is \nmade  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  Government\u2019s  National  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (2001); (b) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995); \n(c) the short resettlement plans for the Project; and (d) the agreed compensation \nplan  for  the  Project.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  compliance  with  this \nparagraph  is  covered  in  quarterly  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  by  the \nGovernment to ADB. \n(iii)  The Government and NWSDB will ensure that (a) the Project is carried out in \naccordance with the existing environmental laws and regulations of Sri Lanka \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); (b) all monitoring and mitigation measures \nindicated  in  the  IEEs  and  the  CEA  environmental  approval  documents,  and \nprovided for under the EMPs are undertaken for the Project; and (c) project \nimplementation will include consultation with local communities on environmental \nissues. \n(iv)  The Government and NWSDB will ensure that rural PSIUs select subprojects \nthat meet selection criteria satisfactory to ADB, including the entry by CBOs and \nPSs  into  agreements  relating  to  management,  regulation,  and  distribution  of \nwater. \n ", "20  \n(v)  The Government and local governments will prepare by 31 December of each \nyear an operation plan of the next fiscal year and within 2 months thereafter \nsubmit a copy to ADB. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that NWSDB submits to ADB before 28 February of \neach year (a) end of year income statement for the previous year (inclusive of \nO&M, debt service, and depreciation) and (b) annual projections (inclusive of \nO&M, debt service, and depreciation) for the year of concern. In the event that \n(b) were a negative value, the Government will ensure that NWSDB implements, \nwithin 6 months of the above date, the necessary water and sewerage tariff \nrevisions required to secure a positive net income in each of these sectors. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that NWSDB (a) has introduced a sewerage charge \nand revised it to accommodate O&M cost recovery for the year of concern, and \n(b) has revised water tariffs in accordance with assurance (vi) and to ensure \ncoverage of O&M of the schemes developed under the Project.  \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  NWSDB  implements  the  financial  and \noperational performance indicators set forth in its Corporate Strategy 2002, as \nimproved from time to time. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n70.  New subsidiary financing agreements for ADF and OCR loans, respectively, in a form \nand substance acceptable to ADB, will have been duly authorized and executed on behalf of the \nGovernment and NWSDB, and are legally binding upon them in accordance with its terms. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loans would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the  supplementary  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights  31,481,000  comprising  (a)  an  amount  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights 18,916,577 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; and (b) an amount \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 12,564,423 from proposed utilization of \nsurplus  loan  proceeds  as  described  in  paragraph  44  of  this  report,  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Towns and Rural \nCommunity-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board; and  \n(ii)  the supplementary loan of $13,500,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of \nSri Lanka for the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply \nand Sanitation Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n2 November 2006 \n ", "    Appendix 1  21 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR \n \nProject Name                                    Year           Source            Amount \n                                 Approved                                     (million) \n \nA.

However, following farmers\u2019 objection in 2003, ID \nreverted the joint agreement and alternative sources had to be identified. The only sustainable source identified is the \nMahaweli River. At the request of NWSDB, new groundwater investigations were being undertaken to ascertain or reject the \nviability of this option. Full groundwater assessment (including full long-term sustainability of this option) completed by \nNWSDB\u2019s Groundwater Section in June 2006 and submitted to ADB for review. Tests demonstrate that the required yield \ncan be obtained but sustainability cannot be secured (i) over extended abstraction periods, and (ii) under the most extreme \nseasonal conditions (including the end of the dry season). The Project will proceed to re-tendering the design-and-build \ncontract with direct water abstraction from the Mahaweli in December 2006.

Approval of the financial and operational improvement support program was obtained in June 2005 and \nImprovement  NWSDB is monitoring its implementation quarterly. Loan funds to support the financial management and operational \nSupport  improvement program have been specifically allocated to a selected number of activities, including the following. \n(i)  A financial management program: (a) introduction of corrective measures to reduce accounting errors and \ndeficiencies (to be completed in October 2006), (b) introduction of an integrated computer management system \nallowing tracking of debtors and stocks (to be completed in December 2006), and (c) valuation of asset registry \n(to be completed by 4 quarter 2006). \n(ii)  An operational efficiency plan to reduce O&M costs is under implementation, including: (a) an ongoing training \ncomponent; (b) enhancing collection performance and customer satisfaction through upgrading of computer \nhardware  and  the  introduction  of  computer-assisted  bill  receiving  cashier  points;  (c)  reducing  power \nconsumption  through  improved  plant  efficiency,  introduction  of  energy  saving  measures,  and  supply  and \ninstallation of equipment to reduce energy losses; and (d) improving institutional (technical) capacity for repairs \nand maintenance. \n(iii)  A small non-revenue water component is under implementation but activities are generally limited to the \nreplacement of defective piping. While other ongoing projects may be providing support to non-revenue water \ndevelopment, it is essential that preventive programs and the use of diagnosis tools be institutionalized. \n(iv)  The program for reduction of power consumption has been particularly successful despite the limited allocation \nof funds, including training engineers in all regional support centers and continuous support from NWSDB offices \n \nin Colombo. ADB\u2019s project funds (SLRs15 million) are to be allocated to proposed scheme improvements in \nAnuradhapura.

The difference arises from the following: (i) the \nnature of the components proposed under the original design; (ii) the change in unit price in \ninternational markets, as is the case of Muttur, where the original design proposed a relatively \nlarge number of pumps and other electromechanical equipment, and (iii) change in demand for \nspecific services, equipment and materials.  \n                                                 \n1  At appraisal (November 2002), the currency exchange was $1 = SLRs96.5; at present, $1 = SLRs103.5.  \n ", "                                                                                                                                                 Appendix 5     33\n \n \nTable A5.2: Cost Overrun Caused by Price Escalation \n \nPart A \u2013 in Absolute SLRs  Original Design \nUrban Component  % Difference  NWSDB (2001) Rates  NWSDB (2006) Rates \n(NWSDB price)  (SLRs)  (SLRs) \nMuttur Water Supply  73  467,884,000  811,044,728 \nHambantota Water Supply  57  941,874,440  1,475,500,441 \nPolonaruwa Water Supply  70  470,931,500  800,910,600 \nBatticaloa Water Supply  67  2,133,761,500  3,559,961,280 \n              Total  66  4,014,451,440  6,647,417,049 \n \nPart B \u2013 Adjusted for  Original Design \nCurrency Devaluation \nUrban Component  % Difference   NWSDB (2001) Rates  NWSDB (2006) Rates \n(NWSDB price)  ($)  ($) \nMuttur Water Supply  64  4,861,132  7,951,419 \nHambantota Water Supply  48  9,785,708  14,465,691 \nPolonaruwa Water Supply  60  4,892,795  7,852,065 \nBatticaloa Water Supply  57  22,168,951  34,901,581 \n  Total  56  41,708,586  65,170,756 \nNWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board  \nNote: Values are for base cost, excluding taxes and contingencies. \nAll prices estimated in SLRs.

Price factors contributing to cost escalation (Table A5.3) have two sources: (i) a notable \nrise  in  international  market  rates  for  equipment  and  construction  materials,  and  (ii)  price \nescalation resulting from the post-tsunami construction boom.2 In addition, cost underestimation \nat appraisal significantly affected the Project.    \n \n \n                                                 \n2  While price escalation seems to have affected a number of projects in South Asia and elsewhere (of particular \nrelevance are ongoing projects in roads and urban sectors in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), the water supply and \nsanitation sector in Sri Lanka appears to be most significantly affected.

Table A5.4 shows that the original packages estimated using NWSDB rates are about \n35% lower than existing market rates. This is consistent with data presented in Table A5.3 and \nmay be partly because NWSDB rates are established annually based on packages awarded \nduring the previous year. This would not normally be significant, but recent years have seen \nunusually high increases that have substantially affected estimates. The assessment conducted \non the revised design\u2014comparing the use of NWSDB (2006) versus market (2006) rates3\u2014is \nless conclusive in terms of components. However, overall, NWSDB (2006) rates are about 23% \nbelow market rates.  \n \n6.  Cost  Overrun  due  to  Physical  Changes.  Design  modifications  were  introduced \nfollowing completion of hydrological, water quality, topographical, geotechnical, inundation, and \nenvironmental surveys. Depending on the subproject town, the surveys indicated the need to \n(i) resize intake structures; (ii) revise electromechanical arrangements and, consequently, piping \nmaterial; (iii) provide full conventional water treatment; and (iv) provide adequate foundations to \novercome potential land subsidence, in the case of Muttur. Such changes were introduced to \nensure that: (i) required drinking water quality levels are achieved in accordance with national \nand World Health Organization standards; (ii) water quantity under the Project is sufficient and \nextracted at sustainable rates (and associated changes in intake); and (iii) full compliance is \nsecured with safety requirements, and environment and social safeguards. The cost overrun, \nbased on NWSDB (2006) rates, caused by physical changes in each town, is summarized in \nTable A5.5. \n \n7.  Table A.5.5 shows that the compound percentage difference in design (defined as the \npercentage change incurred by incorporating physical changes in the project) is 25%, based on \n2006 rates. The cost overrun, compared with cost deviations from the original appraisal, is \naround 20% of the base cost. Detailed tables are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n                                                 \n3  Based on information provided by the project management unit (PMU) during fact-finding (NWSDB 2006 rates) and \nappraisal (market rates) missions. \n   ", "36     Appendix 5 \n \nTable A5.5: Cost Overrun Caused by Physical Changes \n \n  Original Design       Revised Design \nUrban Component  NWSDB (2006) Rates  Market (2006) Rates  % Change \n(US$)  (US$)  (design) \nMuttur Water Supply  7,836,181  8,281,872  6 \nHambantota Water Supply  14,256,043  21,256,625  49 \nPolonaruwa Water Supply  7,738,267  11,743,881  52 \nBatticaloa Water Supply  34,395,761  39,191,565  14 \n  Total  64,226,252  80,472,943  25 \nNWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Rural Component \n \n8.  This  component  is  a  sector-like  component.  Precise  design  was  not  conducted  at \nfeasibility; instead sample subprojects were utilized to conduct projections. New estimates for \nthis component are based on ongoing subprojects for batch 1 and associated projections for \nbatch 2.  The  increase  in  costs  has  been  partially  offset  by  the  following  facts:  (i)  original \nestimates (September 2002) for this component were above estimates computed using NWSDB \nrates for 2001 ($10 million instead of $7.5 million), making it a more expensive proposal at that \ntime; and (ii) activities have been redesigned for cost-efficiency, minimizing capital expenditure \nwhile optimizing operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The resulting cost overrun has been \ncontained  at  38%,  which  correlates  with  price  escalation  and  inflation.  Labor  rates  have \nsignificantly increased as a result of high demand in the post-tsunami reconstruction process. \nHowever,  the  overrun  for  this  component  has  also  been  largely  contained  as  a  result  of \ncommunities being responsible for providing unskilled labor for civil works. \n \nC.  Project Management \n \n9.  Project management will require additional resources for: (i) supplementary person-\nmonths  of  supervision  consultants,  and  (ii)  project  management  unit  (PMU)/project \nimplementation unit (PIU) salaries and running costs. \n \n10.  Supervision Consultancy. With regard to design and supervision consultants, at the \nfeasibility stage, supervision staff was analyzed on a subproject basis as the exact work and \npackaging  under  the  contracts  was  uncertain.  The  number  of  supervision  engineers  and \nassistant  supervision  engineers  was  minimized,  and  has  been  found  to  be  insufficient  to \nimplement the Project in a timely manner in four geographically dispersed project towns at the \nsame time. It was suggested/expected that the supervision person-months deficit could be \nfulfilled with Executing Agency staff, but this has not proven possible given: (i) multiple NWSDB \ncommitments  in  the  post-tsunami  reconstruction  process;  (ii)  an  NWSDB  \u201cfreeze\u201d  (or \nminimization) on recruitment; and (iii) operation in \u201cdifficult\u201d areas attracting a smaller number of \nskilled staff, often at additional premium rates. Additional supervision consulting requirements \nare estimated at about 1,500 person-months of national consultants. The expected cost overrun \ncaused by additional consulting requirements is the source of 2% of the cost overrun. \n \n11.  Government Incremental Costs. The PMU informed the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) that the reasons for the 50% increase in cost estimate from $2.4 million to $3.6 million \nincluded an increase of 40% in NWSDB staff salaries during 2003/04 and a further 10% in 2004. \nFew additional staff resources (compensation officer in Batticaloa, two environment officers) \nhave been recruited for smooth implementation. In addition, transportation costs (for accessing \nsites and ensuring that the PMU and its staff adequately support the PIUs and ongoing works) \n ", "                                                                                                                                        Appendix 5            3   7                               \nhave increased by 40\u201350% because of high oil prices.

Taxes and Duties \n \n12.  Based on recent computations (Supplementary Appendix E) for feasibility and current \ndesigns, duties calculated at appraisal for the original project may have been miscalculated and \nunderestimated at appraisal. Total taxes and duties calculated at appraisal were estimated at \n$7.6 million. However, taxes and duties at feasibility (exclusively for the urban component) \nshould have been $17.3 million instead and may have resulted from the accidental omission of \nGovernment and Service Tax/Value Added Tax. For the original design, the total value for taxes \nand duties would have remained largely unchanged over the 2001-2006. Moreover, the change \nin design would have left taxes and duties contributions largely unchanged, but updating for \nmarket prices would have resulted in an overall 11% increase. Financing for additional taxes \nand duties will remain part of the Government\u2019s counterpart contribution under the proposed \nsupplementary loans. The financing gap for taxes and duties is estimated at $15 million for the \nentire of the Project, or 200% increase from original calculations ($7.6 million). Overall, it must \nbe however noted that taxes would appear to have decreased (as a percentage of the total \namount) over the period of implementation.      \n \nE.  Summary \n \n13.  Table A5.7 summarizes cost escalation by component and cause. The main component \nsubject to cost overrun is the urban water supply and sanitation component. Major causes for \nthe cost overrun include: (i) price escalation (36%), (ii) undercosting at appraisal (24%), and (iii) \nphysical changes (21%).   \n \nTable A5.7: Summary Cost Overrun Evaluation \n \n  Cost Increase ($ million) \n  Price  Physical  Under- Taxes and  Total  % \nComponent  Escalation  Change  costing  Duties \nUrban Component  23.5  16.5  18.7  12.8  71.5  89 \nRural Component  4.3  0.0  0.0  1.2  5.5  7 \nInstitutional Strengthening  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nProject Management  1.2  n/a  1.0  1.0  3.2  4 \n  Total  29.0  16.5  19.7   15.0  80.2  100 \n              %  36  21  24  19  100   \nNote: Cost overrun is calculated from base cost + taxes.

Electromechanical works and \nreservoirs are to be constructed to serve all 3 plants. A Single (600 mm diameter) raw water main has been replaced by 2 x \n300 mm water mains for the Government of Austria-financed and existing water treatment plants, and a 500 mm diameter \nDI for the new plant. Given land restrictions within the site, a mechanical sludge dewatering system is required instead of \nlagoons/sludge drying beds.  \n \nWater Distribution. As a result of an increase in the diameter of transmission mains, and to withstand internal pressure, \npiping material has been changed from PVC to DI in various sections. A 500 mm DI treated water transmission main from \nAmbalantota to Mirijjawila has been separated from the main package. Extension to the distribution system required \naccommodation/modification of service areas after the tsunami and the introduction of a coastal protection buffer zone. \nBatticaloa Water  Source (Unnichchai tank) sustainability and security of supply was checked during feasibility, and confirmed during detailed \nSupply Scheme  design. Detailed engineering design demonstrated that expansion of the tank\u2019s capacity only required raising the dam wall \nby 5.0 feet instead of 7.5 feet, as initially indicated at feasibility; consequent size reduction of the water intake would result \nfrom change in design capacity and concept using submersible pumps. The access bridge from the intake well to the \nabutment of the tank was newly accommodated for pump maintenance.  \n \nWater Treatment. Following a monthly monitoring program, which included testing for algae (and potentially toxic strains of \nblue-green algae), the water treatment plant design had to be modified to include treatment against the potential seasonal \npresence of cyanobacteria. The water treatment plant will now include dissolved air floatation activated carbon adsorption \n(PAC) and chlorination. In addition, sludge lagoons had to be incorporated into the design of the plant. The capacity of the \nwater treatment plant reduced from 54,000 cum/day to 40,000 cum/day after reassessment of non-revenue water.  \n \nTransmission Mains. Following geotechnical investigations, which indicated the presence of hard rock near the road \nsurface, partial rock excavation for casing of the raw water transmission mains will be required in several selected sections. \nTreated water transmission mains will be encased in cement structures and laid across the lagoons instead of anchored on \nexisting bridges, given their precarious conditions and their location in security sensitive areas.  \n \nDistribution Network. The viability of electromechanical works was reviewed and modified, resulting in requirements of \none  additional  pumping  station  and  one  additional  groundwater  reservoir.  Distribution  systems  were  reviewed  to \naccommodate tsunami resettlement area demands. The number of distribution pumps increased from (2+1 stand by) to \n(4+2 standby). The total number of elevated towers remains the same, but capacity has been increased by 50%. The total \nsize of the distribution network was reevaluated since feasibility, requiring 40% additional length (from 183 km to 261 km).  \n   ", " \nSubproject  Technical Assessment and Changes since Appraisal \nBatticaloa Hospital  No significant changes. Package treatment plant for hospital and prison proposed at appraisal. Sewerage system designed \nand Prison  to include extended aeration activated sludge process package wastewater treatment plant (3,500 people) with effluent \nSewerage  discharge to lagoon, and waste sludge to CEA approved land disposal area.    \nBatticaloa  No details for the drainage scheme were presented at the feasibility stage. Priority areas are in the process of being \nDrainage  identified and defined. Drainage works proposed along 25 streets (21 km); additional drainage for Arayampathy (10 km) \n  and Kattankudy (21 streets, 10 km) is under consideration.  \nMuttur Water  Source. Required reestablishment of intake 1.5 km downstream. Since the location is in the flood plain, and flood-free \nSupply Scheme  access is to be provided, intake was modified after incorporating the following in the design: (i) silt and sand removal \nfeatures in the intake channel, (ii) fencing and protection from and for surrounding wildlife, (iii) access bridge, (iv) bank \nprotection against erosion, and (v) site elevation against flooding and drainage. The civil structure was designed for ultimate \nflow of 40,000 cum/day. \n \nWater Plant treatment capacity reduced by 20% and treated water storage capacity of 3000 cum provided. Sludge drying \nbeds adopted as land for lagoons not available. Based on findings reported in geotechnical investigations, highlighting poor \nsubsoil condition, elevated towers design was modified to incorporate pile foundations, while the water treatment plant is to \nbe constructed on piles. Number of elevated towers reduced from three to two.  \nMuttur Drainage  Priority areas are in the process of being identified and defined. Drainage works are proposed along 15 streets (16 km).  \nPolonnaruwa  Source. Investigations conducted during project preparation proposed a combination of: (i) augmented extraction for \nWater Supply  drinking water supply purposes from Parakrama Samudra irrigation tank, and (ii) extraction from Mahaweli Ganga (river) \nScheme  Alluvium (through boreholes). Although the preliminary design\u2014recommended and agreed with the Irrigation Department \n(through an MOU)\u2014proposed water extraction to be sourced from the Parakrama Samudra tank, the agreement was later \ncontested because of farmers\u2019 objections after severe drought conditions in 2003. A revised option for extraction from the \nMahaweli requires an increase in the size of the intake to accommodate an extractive capacity of 30,500 cum/day, including \nsilt removal features and additional pumping from this location 5\u20137 km away. \n \nTreatment and Transmission. Raw water transmission mains required an increase in size from 200 mm to 500 mm \ndiameter. Consequently, materials had to be modified from PVC to ductile iron, while the length increased from 3.0 km to \n4.1 km. Given the change in the quality of water at source, the water treatment process changed from chlorination to full \ntreatment. Two treated water transmission lines to feed into two elevated towers. No changes in the number of towers or \ndistribution coverage.   \nMatara Salinity  A solution to farmers\u2019 opposition following appraisal has not been found. Estimated compensation for the scheme would be \n \nBarrier  three times the cost of the subproject, making it economically and financially unviable.    \nA\nComponent 2: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation  p\np\ne\nWater Supply  In view of the extreme poverty conditions affecting the area surrounding Unnichchai tank in Batticaloa District, it was agreed  n\nd\nSchemes  that PSs in the area benefit from this component.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project \nwas approved on 16 January 2003. Since loan effectiveness, the Project has established 1 \nproject  management  unit  (PMU),  5  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  and  9  Pradeshiya \nShaba  (PS)  implementation  units  (PSIUs)  which  are  supported  by  technical  support  units \n(TSUs). Given geographical considerations, the PMU was established in Colombo, providing \nsupport countrywide. Four of the PIUs are located in each of the project towns (Batticaloa, \nHambantota, Polonnaruwa, and Muttur). They provide support to all activities undertaken in their \nrespective  districts  but  mainly  focus  on  construction  and  implementation  of  the  urban \ncomponent. The fifth PIU, of specific technical nature, is housed in the Irrigation Department for \nthe purpose of designing, coordinating, and implementing the Unnichchai tank augmentation \nworks. To date, PSIUs have been created in each of the 8 PSs (4 in Anuradhapura, 3 in \nPolonnaruwa, and 1 in Batticaloa) selected for implementation of activities under batch 1 of the \nrural component. Further, 6 PSIUs are envisaged to be created in support of activities to be \nimplemented under batch 2. While fulfilling different roles, PIUs and TSUs are housed within the \nsame offices in Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa, providing efficient complementary support. \n \nB.   Organizational Structure \n \n2.  The organization of the Project is well laid out, and functions and responsibilities of the \nPMU staff are clearly defined in the job descriptions prepared for the Project. The PMU is \nstaffed by a mix of National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) positions (project \ndirector, deputy project director, project accountant, an engineer, and supporting staff). This is \nsupported by specific project staff (3 engineers, sociologist, assistant engineer, and supporting \nstaff), a project management consultant team, and a design and supervision consultant team. \nThe consulting teams provide support to PIUs and PSIUs, and their location can be in any of the \nunits, depending on support needs and other requirements. Similarly, each of the PIUs/TSUs is \nstaffed with a combination of NWSDB and project-specific staff (including project managers, \naccountants, engineers, engineer assistants, sociologists, and support staff). PSIUs, in assisting \ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs) implement the rural component, consist of engineers \nand community development specialists. The total current technical staff amounts to 52 for the \nentire Project and 39 support staff. \n \nC.   Executing Agency\u2019s Mandate  \n \n3.  NWSDB  retains  its  mandate,  as  defined  in  the  1974  National  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage Board Act, under the recently created Ministry of Urban Development and Water \nSupply (MUDWS). NWSDB has a mandate: (i) to develop, operate, and control an efficient, \ncoordinated water supply and to distribute water for public, domestic, and industrial purposes; \n(ii) to establish, develop, operate, and control an efficient, coordinated sewerage system; (iii) to \ntake  over  and  carry  on  any  water  supply  or  sewerage  undertaking  of  any  local  authority \ntransferred to NWSDB either by a voluntary transfer order or by a compulsory transfer order; \nand (iv) to provide a supply of water and distribute or sell water in bulk or otherwise to any local \nauthority, any government department, any other institution or organization, or any individual. \n \nD.  Implementation Capacity  \n \n4.  NWSDB has implemented numerous projects assisted by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), World Bank, and other bilateral aid partners. At present, ongoing projects for NWSDB \n ", "                                                                                                                                 Appendix 7  41\n   \nalone are valued at SLRs67,956 million ($672.83 million), of which 70% are foreign-funded, \nincluding two ADB-funded projects. In addition to this Project, NWSDB has implemented three \nprevious ADB projects, two of which have been completed, evaluated, and rated generally \nsuccessful in the project completion report. Despite the increasing number of projects being \nimplemented, NWSDB\u2019s implementation capacity remains adequate. Moreover, in an effort to \nimprove its operational performance and efficiency, NWSDB has introduced a human resources \nincentive  program  and  a  strategy  with  targets  to  reduce  staff-to-connection  ratios. \nConsequently, recruitment of permanent staff is carefully monitored, and often combined with a \nprogram of recruitment of contractual staff, supporting several of its ongoing projects.  \n \n5.  However, consistent with ADB\u2019s evaluation,1 the balanced combination of NWSDB long-\nterm staff and recruitment of contractual staff has yielded a generally efficient arrangement of \nPMU and PIUs, with individual focused tasks and deliverables. The use of external staff has \nbrought the Project a new influx of external influences, based on varying experiences outside \nthe Executing Agency (EA). It is also important to indicate that this Project will provide water \nsupply schemes in two towns and augment water supplies in two further towns. Water supply \nand sanitation available staff in all four towns is currently scarce. Although interaction with \nexisting staff is active, the project strategy envisages the conversion of temporary staff in the \nPIUs into permanent staff to be trained by the contractor in operation and maintenance.  \n \n6.  The  Project  provides  an  important  component  aimed  at  improving  and  developing \ncapacity at all levels (NWSDB, Project, and CBOs). This component is at an advanced stage of \nimplementation and, combined with the public awareness exercise being conducted under the \nProject, is expected to allow the Project to achieve capacity development targets at individual, \norganizational,  and  sector  level.  Early  benefits  have  been  reported  by  NWSDB  as  having \nsupported the delivery of proposed targets for improved operational and financial performance \nunder the NWSDB corporate strategy.2 An assessment of NWSDB\u2019s financial management \ncapacity is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nE.   PMU Financial Management Capacity \u2013 Financial Management Systems \n \n7.  Staffing. The main concern of the Project is on fast turnover of personnel. The Project \ncontinues  to  lose  local  staff,  particularly  in  the  PIUs,  to  tsunami-related  projects.  Many \ncommunity development workers have left to work in emergency projects that offered higher \nsalaries than the Project. This has given rise to other problems such as delays in project \nidentification and social preparation because of the lack of local community staff.  The Project\u2019s \nfinance unit also lost several staff and is currently recruiting six more personnel to be fielded in \nthe PMU and the PIUs. The recruitment process is long and slow, since even clerical positions \nneed the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The appointments of project staff, except for the \nkey positions, are on a contractual basis and are renewed annually. \n \n8.  Financial  Reports  and  Audited  Arrangements.  Financial  reports  prepared  by  the \nProject consist of a balance sheet and related statement of expenditures. Reports are prepared \non time and the audited reports for 2005 were submitted in April 2006, ahead of schedule \n(September 30 of each fiscal year). Except for some minor findings and recommendations that \nare included to enhance further the financial management of the Project, the overall audit report \non the project is satisfactory. The project accounts are audited annually by the Auditor General\u2019s \n(government body) office during February and March. NWSDB also conducts periodic audits of \nthe project accounts through its Internal Audit Unit.    \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Special Evaluation Study.

The Project uses a computerized financial accounting system, \nMSL accounting package, which was procured locally in Sri Lanka. The same system was used \nin the ADB-financed Third Water Supply Project.3 Based on demonstration runs requested \nduring the field audit, it was observed that the existing system works efficiently and effectively; it \nis able to generate financial reports with ease and facility.  \n \n10.  Project  Cost  Accounting  System.  The  financial  accounting  and  reporting  system \nneeds some revision to enable cost accounting of projects by scheme. Although the entity has \nan appropriate system that allows recording by sources of funds and disbursement categories, \nthe project costs are not systematically recorded by components. When a project is completed, \nit is difficult to classify the construction work in progress into specific property, plant, and \nequipment accounts. This was one of the findings in the 31 December 2005 audit report. In its \nresponse of 14 June 2006, the PMU, through NWSDB, has committed to improve on this finding \nimmediately where it indicated that it has begun efforts to amend the MSL accounting package. \n \n11.  Disbursements  and  Funds  Flow  System.  The  Project\u2019s  disbursement  system \ncomplies  strictly  with  ADB  disbursement  guidelines.  It  maintains  a  first  generation  imprest \naccount with the Central Bank and second generation imprest accounts with the provincial \nbranches of the People\u2019s Bank in Annuradhapura, Polonaruwa, Katubedda, and Baticaloa to \nmake payments in the PIUs. The disbursement and fund flow systems are well defined and \nappropriate, and allow for the timely disbursement of project funds. There is sufficient control \nover disbursements. Levels of authority for approval of payments and signatories to check \nvouchers  are  clearly  defined  at  PIUs  and  the  PMU.  The  majority  of  disbursements  are \nprocessed in the PMU; only minor disbursements are allowed for payments to the PIUs. A minor \nconcern over the disbursement system relates to the manual processing of payment vouchers. \nSubstantial  work  on  processing  of  disbursements  could  be  reduced  if  the  vouchers  were \ngenerated with the MSL accounting package.      \n \nF.   Capacity to Undertake Procurement  \n \n12  NWSDB\u2019s capacity to undertake the procurement envisaged under the Project has been \nproven satisfactory based on previous experience and ongoing project activities. Under the \ncurrent  arrangements,  the  PMU  is  tasked  with  the  preparation  of  the  majority  of  detailed \nengineering designs and bidding documents. The project director and deputy project director \nhave long-standing experience in performing and review of documents, and are supported by \nPMU engineers and a procurement specialist. The documents are then submitted to the Cabinet \nAppointed Tender Committee (CATB) or Ministry Tender Board and ADB for review, while bid \nevaluation is conducted by a CATB-appointed Tender Evaluation Committee. The PMU, through \nreports prepared semiannually coinciding with the project joint review missions, updates the \nexisting procurement plan, containing all milestone dates, and discusses any variations or \ndeviations from it. The latest version (September 2006) is in Supplementary Appendix J. While \nthe procurement capacity of NWSDB and the PMU are satisfactory, bid evaluation reports often \ndo not meet requirements outlined in ADB\u2019s Guide on Bid Evaluation on first submission.4 To \novercome this problem, the PMU organized a series of training seminars in May 2006 on bid \nevaluation for members of the Tender Evaluation Committee. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project, approved on 16 January 2003, is designed to provide urban water supply \nand sanitation in five urban centers (urban component), rural water supply and sanitation in two \ndistricts of the North Central Province (rural component), and institutional strengthening and \npublic awareness campaigns (institutional strengthening component). A short resettlement plan \n(RP) was prepared by the Executing Agency (EA)\u2014the National Water Supply and Drainage \nBoard  (NWSDB)\u2014in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  National  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy,  2001,  and  the Policy on  Involuntary Resettlement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).1 The RP had two parts: (i) addressing temporary loss of livelihood for farmers, laborers, \nand fishers affected by lowering water levels in the Unnichchai tank during tank augmentation; \nand (ii) addressing resettlement impacts caused by the permanent acquisition of 10.0 hectares \n(ha)  of  land,  of  which  NWSDB  owns  1.1  ha,  the  Government  owns  7.5  ha,  and  private \nindividuals own 1.4 ha. \n \n2.  Supplementary financing has been requested by the Government because of significant \ncost  overruns.  The  causes  of  the  overruns  include:  (i)  price  increases  or  inflation, \n(ii) underestimation  of  costs  in  conflict-affected  areas,  (iii)  changes  in  project  design,  and \n(iv) partial delays in project implementation resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The \ncurrent  project  design will  have  the  same  impacts  on  the  temporary  loss  of  livelihood  for \nfarmers, laborers, and fishers affected by lowering water levels in the Unnichchai tank during \ntank augmentation. The compensation plan is available on the ADB website, and the summary \nprovided  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  G.  There  are  no  changes  in  the  resettlement  impact  for  lowering  levels  in  the \nUnnichchai tank, so the existing compensation plan will be followed to address the temporary \nloss of livelihood. Modifications in project design will result in physical changes which alter \npermanent  land  acquisition  for  the  Project.  The  revised  RP  below  addresses  the  physical \nchanges in the project design. 2 \n \nB.   Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n3.  The Project avoids involuntary resettlement and minimizes impacts where unavoidable\u2014\nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the  Government\u2019s  national \ninvoluntary  resettlement  policy.  Rehabilitation  will  be  undertaken  within  existing  facilities. \nGovernment land will be used for new construction to the extent possible, and requirements for \nnew  construction  will  avoid  permanent  houses  or  structures  and  impacts  on  land.  Where \ngovernment  land  is  not  available  because  of  constraints  on  locating  treatment  plants  and \ndistribution towers (such as elevation and proximity to water sources), the acquisition of private \nland is required. The Project ensures the acquisition of private land which will not require \ndislocation or loss of significant productive assets. Water transmission and distribution mains \nwill be located in road rights-of-way (ROW). ROWs can accommodate construction activities \nand are not likely to affect people. Prior notice will be provided to all affected persons (APs) and \ntraffic  mitigation  measures  are  provided  in  the  Project\u2019s  initial  environmental  examination. \nLaying of water pipelines are proposed within ROWs and temporary land acquisition is not \nrequired.  Minor  impacts,  which  will  be  addressed  by  contractors,  are  anticipated  during \nconstruction. The Project requires the permanent acquisition of 11.70 ha of land, of which \nNWSDB owns 0.60 ha, the Government owns 9.20 ha, and private individuals own 1.94 ha.

Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n4.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Program are based on national law: \n(i) The Land Acquisition Act No. 9 of 1950 (LAA); (ii) the National Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy, 2001 (NIRP); and (iii) ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. An entitlement matrix for \nthe Project, based on the above policies and the anticipated impacts, is in Table A9.3. \n \nD.  Information Dissemination, Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n5.  The original RP was disclosed to all APs to give them an opportunity to discuss with \nNWSDB concerns regarding the Project, and was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Local language \nversions of this summary RP will be provided by the project implementation units (PIUs) and \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue \nthroughout project implementation. Grievances of APs will first be brought to the attention of the \nPIU and relevant NWSDB resident engineer. Grievances not redressed will be brought to the \nresettlement specialist (RS) in the project management unit (PMU); if not addressed by the RS, \nthe PMU will request the stakeholder\u2019s committee to act as grievance redress committee (GRC). \nIn consideration of the small number of APs affected by permanent land acquisition, the GRC is \nnot expected to hold regular meetings to act on grievances, but will meet only when a grievance \nis not resolved by the PMU. It will be given notice of the meeting, meet to determine the merit of \nthe grievance, and resolve the grievance within a month of receiving the notice for the meeting. \nFurther grievances will be referred by APs to appropriate courts of law.  \n \nE.  Compensation \n \n6.  All losses will be compensated based on replacement values2 consistent with NIRP and \nADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. The entitlement matrix further defines entitlements to \nvulnerable households. Vulnerable households will be provided additional assistance in the form \nof land-for-land replacement options with the replacement land having facilities from the Project \n(e.g.,  under  the  coverage  of  the  piped  water  system  and/or  sewerage),  preference  for \n                                                 \n2  Consistent with the original RP: \u201c(i) When the title to the land is clear, a government evaluation will be prepared and \nthe negotiations with the owner will start. Negotiations will be conducted by NWSDB. (ii) The government \nevaluation will be based in replacement value as defined in ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Titleholders will \nbe compensated for all permanent land losses at full replacement cost. (iii) NWSDB will approve the earlier \nagreement  reached  between  the  owner  and  NWSDB.  NWSDB\u2019s  legal  officer  will  execute  the  deed,  and \ncompensation will be disbursed by the PMU to the owner within one month of reaching the agreement. (iv) If \nagreement is not reached, NWSDB will resort to compulsory acquisition, in which the minister responsible for lands \nwill issue an order under section 2 of Lands Acquisition. In such an event, NWSDB will comply with the National \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy and ADB policies and ensure that replacement value is paid for the required land.\u201d \n   ", "                                                                                                            Appendix 9  49  \nemployment in subproject activities, and short-term allowances. The entitlement matrix clarifies \nvaluation of compensation. \n \nF.  Institutional Framework, Resettlement Costs, and Implementation Schedule \n \n7.  NWSDB under the Ministry of Urban Development and Water Supply (MUDWS) is the \nEA responsible for implementing the Project. A PMU in NWSDB supports the Project. PIUs in all \nsecondary towns are responsible for day-to-day project implementation. The PMU, through a \nresettlement specialist, is responsible for the overall implementation and monitoring of the RP, \nand consequently for the preparation of monitoring reports. PIUs will be responsible for the day-\nto-day implementation and monitoring of the RP. The Project has allocated a budget under \ncounterpart funding to finance the land acquisition. The PMU will be responsible for disbursing \ncompensation within 1 month of reaching a written agreement with APs. All land acquisition, \nincluding payment of compensation, will be completed before civil works contracts can be \nawarded (Table A9.2). \n \nTable A9.2: Implementation Schedule \n \nActivity  Month \nM1  M2  M3  M4  M5  M6  M7 \ni.

RP implementation will be closely monitored to provide the EA with an effective basis for \nassessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying  potential  difficulties and  problems.  Internal \nmonitoring will be undertaken by the PMU to track indicators such as the number of persons \naffected,  assistance  extended,  community  resources  affected,  restoration  undertaken,  and \nfinancial aspects such as compensation paid. Monthly targets will be provided by the RS. \nMonthly progress reports will be prepared by the PMU, reporting actual achievements against \nthe targets and reasons for shortfalls, if any. The PMU will be responsible for managing and \nmaintaining AP databases, documenting results of the AP census, and verifying asset and \nsocioeconomic survey data which will be used as the baseline for assessing RP implementation \nimpacts.  NWSDB  will  submit  reports  on  resettlement  progress  to  ADB  for  review.\n ", "5\n  0\n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\nTable A9.3: Entitlement Matrix   pe\nn\n  Type of Loss  Application  Definition of  Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues  Responsible Agency  d\nix\nEntitled   9\nPerson     \nA.

Upper Watershed Management Project1 \n1.  A loan amounting to $16.6 million equivalent (SDR12,237,000) was approved by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) on 24 September 1997 to: (i) rehabilitate and sustainably \nmanage and protect critical wetlands, (ii) improve incomes of project beneficiaries, and (iii) \nfacilitate the establishment of a medium and long-term watershed management policy. The \nMinistry of Forestry and Environment, as the Executing Agency (EA), had overall responsibility \nfor project implementation. Implementing agencies included the Forest Department and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and support from the Wildlife Department. The project\u2019s closing date \nwas 31 December 2005 with loan savings of about SDR 2,621,449 (or about $3.87 million). \n \nB.  Second Perennial Crops Development Project2 \n2.  A  loan  for $20.0  million  equivalent  (SDR14,743,000)  was  approved  by  ADB  on  25 \nSeptember 1997 to: (i) support further perennial crops development, and (ii) institute measures \nto ensure sustainability of credit facilities and extension services of perennial crops. The Ministry \nof Agriculture and Lands and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were the EAs. The project was \ncompleted  on  30  June  2006  with  loan  savings  amounting  to  SDR1,085,912  (about \n$1.60 million). \n \nC.  Tea Development Project3 \n3.  A  loan  for  the  Tea  Development  Project  amounting  to  $35  million  equivalent \n(SDR26,326,000) was approved by ADB on 10 November 1998. The project aimed to increase \nthe income of tea smallholders and private states on a sustainable basis and to improve \nenvironment at the same time. For this purpose the project was to: (i) undertake institutional \nreforms to improve the effectiveness of tea-related institutions and rationalize the rebate to \nbenefit  the  smaller  holdings,  (ii)  provide  credit  financing  for  replanting  and  infilling  on \nsmallholdings  and  private  states,  and  (iii)  improve  social  infrastructure.  The  project  was \ncompleted on 31 December 2005 with loan savings totaling SDR659,172 (about $0.97 million). \n \nD.  Water Resources Management Project4 \n4.  On  19  September  2000,  ADB  approved  a  loan  for  SDR14,923,000  ($19.7  million \nequivalent)  for  the  Water  Resources  Management  Project  to  strengthen  the  Government's \ncapacity to manage its water resources in a sustainable, participatory, and transparent way. The \nproject was designed in two parts: (i) capacity building to assist in establishing the National \nWater Resources Authority and strengthening existing agencies in the water sector, and (ii) \nconstruction of urgently needed infrastructure for control and measurement of water resources. \nIn October 2004, ADB suspended part A of the loan, because of delayed legal establishment of \nthe National Water Resources Authority. The project\u2019s closing date was 30 June 2006 with loan \nsavings of about SDR 8,197,888 (or about $12.11 million). \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

The  feasibility  study  for  the  Project  envisaged  a  total  of  3,666  person-months  of \nconsultants for local supervisory support under the Project. During preparation and appraisal of \nthe Project, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed that the consulting \nservices package could be reduced from the feasibility study estimates. It was also envisaged \nthat most of the contracts would follow design-and-build contracts where need for supervision is \nlimited. Furthermore, subprojects were sequenced so that the consultants could be moved from \none  location  to  another  within  the  project  implementation  period.  However,  given  tsunami \ndelays,  a  reassessment  of  the  two  consulting  packages  under  Project  has  indicated  that \nadditional  local  supervisory  staff  is  required  for  package  B\u2014to  timely  supervise  on  going \nsimultaneous contracts in each town, which will allow meeting the projected Project completion \ndate.  \n \n2.  Other  reasons  for  the  additional  person-months  include  the  following:  (i)  resident \nengineers, assistant resident engineers, and engineering assistant requirements are based on \norganizational needs for adequate supervision of all contracts, including three design-and-build, \nand 12 bill-of-quantity (BOQ) type contracts; (ii) BOQ type contracts are of diverse nature, \nincluding raw and treated water transmission, distribution mains and elevated towers, sewerage \nand  drainage  contracts;  (iii)  additional  quality  control  measures  are  recommended  during \nconstruction; (iv) for Hambantota and Batticaloa, additional assistant resident engineers and \nexecuting agency inputs are critical, considering the large geographic area of these contracts; \n(v)  person-month  estimates  are  based  on  the  individual  contract  durations  agreed  by  the \nProject; (vi) person-month estimates are based on 15 contracts in four project urban areas; (vii) \nBatticaloa and Muttur include supervision/support staff for drainage and sewerage.  Analysis of \nthe additional requirement is in Table A13. There will be no additional person-months allocated \nto package A under Project.   \n \nTable A13: Additional Consultants Requirement for Design and Supervision \n \nConsultants \nConsultant \nFeasibility  RRP  Current  under \nStaff  Requirement \nStudy Report  (Consultant)  Contract  Supplementary \nDesignation  for Full Scope \nLoans \nUnits  PM  Units  PM  Units  PM  Units  PM  Units  PM \nResident \n5  300  5  150  5  150  6  159  1  9 \nEngineer \nAssistant \nResident  7  330  5  126  5  132  10  300  5  168 \nEngineer \nEngineer \n(Electrical and  3  60  4  30  4  30  4  54  0  24 \nMechanical) \nQuantity \n8  228  4  114  5  114  6  162  1  48 \nSurveyor \nEngineering \n11  384  8  204  10  264  22  627  12  363 \nAssistant \nOffice Manager  4  240  0  0  0  0  4  105  4  105 \nAdministrative \n0  0  4  120  4  120  5  135  1  15 \nAssistant \n ", "  Appendix 13  57            \n \nConsultants \nConsultant \nFeasibility  RRP  Current  under \nStaff  Requirement \nStudy Report  (Consultant)  Contract  Supplementary \nDesignation  for Full Scope \nLoans \nUnits  PM  Units  PM  Units  PM  Units  PM  Units  PM \nDraftsman \n7  192  1  18  1  18  5  132  4  114 \n(CAD) \nCommunity \nDevelopment  6  312  3  51  3  51  0  0  (3)  (51) \nAssistant \nClerk/ \nComputer  7  420  0  0  0  0  22  586  22  586 \noperator \nOffice Aid  8  480  1  36  1  36  11  288  10  252 \nDriver  12  720  4  120  4  120  1  24  (3)  (96) \n  Total \n78  3,666  39  969  42  1,035  97  2,572  54  1,537 \nCAD = computer-aided design, RRP = report and recommendation of the President, PM = person-months.    \nNotes:  \n1.

No          \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka:  \n \nSri Lanka ranked 84th among 174 countries in the 2000 United Nations human development index. The percentage of \npoor households fell from 18.2% to 13.4% in urban areas from 1992 to 1996. In the same period, the percentage of poor \nhouseholds declined in rural areas. Despite impressive achievements, poverty levels in Sri Lanka remain high. Poverty is \nmultifaceted and is manifested in the ability to afford basic consumption goods, and lack of access to basic needs such as \nsafe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health care, and education. In recent years, water-related diseases and child \nmalnutrition have worsened. Twenty-eight percent of the population does not have access to safe drinking water and 24% \ndoes not have access to safe sanitation. There are regional variations in dimensions of poverty, with poverty levels in the \nnortheast among the highest in the nation. In some districts, including Muttur, over half of the rural population does not \nhave access to safe drinking water supplies. Inadequate sanitation infrastructure and access to safe drinking water in \nurban and rural areas are the leading causes of public health problems in poor communities. \n \nThe Government\u2019s 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy states that \u201cthe provision of safe drinking water, and adequate \nsewage and sanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, highest social service priority by poor households.\u201d The \nstrategy includes provision of water to 85% of the population by 2010. In April 2002, the Government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) signed a poverty partnership agreement that recognizes water supply and sanitation as a main \nstrategy for poverty reduction. \n \nThe proposed Project will provide safe drinking water to approximately 969,000 people and sanitation facilities to 171,500 \npeople, specifically to poor and low-income households in rural areas of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts of the \nNorth Central Province and in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa. The Project aims \nto  improve  the  living  conditions  and  health  status  of  people  in  the  project  area\u2014specifically,  for  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged. The table below summarizes how investment in the Project will contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nPoverty As  Direct Contribution  Indirect Contribution \n   \nAccess to  Investment in water infrastructure is a catalyst for  Improved health for better quality water \nincome  local and regional development  increases productive capacities \nAccess to  None  Improved school attendance from improved \nprimary  health and reduced water-carrying burdens, \neducation  especially for girls \n \nGender equality  None  Community-based organizations (CBOs) for \n  water management will improve social \ncapital of women \n \nWomen reduced time and health burdens \nfrom improved water services will lead to \nmore balanced gender roles \nHealth  Improved quantities and quality of domestic water  Improved health and reduced labor \n  and sanitation reduce main morbidity and mortality  burdens from water portage reduce \nfactor for young children  mortality risks for women \n   \nImproved health reduces susceptibility to anemia \nand other conditions that affect maternal mortality \nAccess to safe  Access to safe sanitation reduces  Minimizing groundwater extraction \nenvironments  defecation on open areas and  decreases risk of salinization and changes \ndomestic pollution \n \n \n \n \n ", "          Appendix 14  59\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                     Proposed Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty consultations carried out in Sri Lanka by the Poverty Impact Monitoring Unit on behalf of ADB indicate that the \npoor unanimously identify basic infrastructure, including water supply and sanitation, as a priority need. \n \nThe project area includes both urban and rural areas from east, south, and north central regions of the country. There has \nbeen a significant deterioration in the general economic, social, and physical conditions in the northeast region over the \npast two decades because of ethnic conflict and war; and poverty is quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in \nother parts of the country. Although no official statistics are available for this region because the security situation is \nunfavorable, the project socioeconomic surveys show that in Batticaloa and Muttur in the Northeast Province, poverty is \nhigher than in the rest of the country, there is a high concentration of ethnic minorities, health indicators are lower, and the \nsituation is more acute in Muttur. Therefore, 74% of the capital investment of the Project will concentrate in the northeast, \nwhere investments in basic infrastructure have been suspended for the last 20 years and poverty is greater. In \nPolonnaruwa and Anurapurah districts, the poverty incidence is 8% higher than the national figurea and is the third \npoorest province based on the higher poverty line. Within the districts, poverty is higher in rural areas, which are targeted \nin the rural component. The Project will prioritize rural investments based on demand-driven and need criteria. \n \nFour of the five project districts are in the northeast and north central regions. In these four districts, 40\u201345% of the \npeople live below poverty line. Hambantota in the south has a high incidence of drought and limited groundwater. \nAlthough income levels are similar to the national average, the population has to spend more than in other parts of the \ncountry to have access to drinking water. Lack of income, employment, and water are the main concerns among the poor \nin Hambantota district. In low-density areas of Hambantota, the Project will use a community-based approach (currently \nimplemented by the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project) to reach communities. During implementation, \nspecial  attention  will  be  given  to  community  participation  to  overcome  the  lack  of  trust  in  the  Government  and \nnongovernment organization (NGO) efforts.b \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                           Yes     No \n \nDuring project preparation, the project components were discussed with the stakeholders at various levels. The rural \ncomponent  of  the  Project  requires  active  participation  of  communities.  CBOs  will  be  formed  before  subproject \nimplementation and will take responsibility for the selection of proper water system and technology, procurement of \ngoods,  monitoring  of  construction,  and  contribution  to  the  capital  investment  (20%  in  kind  and/or  labor).  After \nimplementation, the CBOs will take ownership of the assets and be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the \nsystems. Local NGOs will facilitate community participation with the CBOs, supported by the Pradeshiya Sabhas. In the \nurban components, a mechanism will be developed for community members in project areas to bring their concerns \nand/or feedback regarding project implementation to the project coordination committee at the central level. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                       Yes                No \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project recognizes that women\u2019s participation in decision making is important, as they are providers, users, and \nmanagers of water at the household level. Women are the best people in a village household to ask about the quantity, \nquality, and reliability of water used by her family. The Project also recognizes that communication and interaction with \nwomen  is  more  effective  when  done  by  other  women;  consequently,  it  is  important  to  include  women  in  the \nimplementation team. Therefore, the Project will actively encourage the participation of women as beneficiaries and \nimplementers. \n \nDuring social mobilization at selected villages, the importance of women\u2019s participation will be explained to beneficiary \ncommunities in village meetings, hygiene education, and all other project activities. The following targets will be achieved \nin the implementation of the rural component: \n  (i)  Project facilitators will emphasize the need to have active participation of all at community meetings, including \n  50% participation by women. \n  (ii) Women will account for 50% participation in small group activities. \n  (iii) The executive committee of the CBOs will be at least 50% women. \n ", "60           Appendix 14 \n \n \n  (iv) Separate discussions with women\u2019s groups will take place regarding technologies and service level of the \n  water supply facilities built by the Project. If major differences occur between women\u2019s groups and mixed or \n  men\u2019s groups, the project facilitators will take an active role to prevent women's decisions being overshadowed. \n \nThe Executing Agency will actively recruit qualified women in all levels of the project implementation structure, especially \nin the rural component. The institutional strengthening component activities related to training will specify how women\u2019s \nparticipation will be encouraged. The following targets shall be achieved in the project implementation and the institutional \nstrengthening component: \n  (i) 25% of professional and technical level staff working in the Project, project monitoring unit (PMU), project \n  implementation unit (PIU), Pradeshiya Sabhas, and counterpart NGOs, will be women. \n  (ii) In the institutional strengthening component, at least 20% of National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n  (NWSDB) professionals who participate in the training subcomponent, will be women. \n  (iii) In designing awareness campaigns about water supply and sanitation, the role of women in the household \n  for most of the provision and use of water will be taken into account. \n \nNWSDB and the PMU will be responsible for developing and implementing the appropriate strategies and action plans to \nachieve these targets. NWSDB and the PMU will monitor these targets through the project progress reports and project \nbenefit monitoring. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
