THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $40,000,000 in Northstar Equity Partners V Limited. \n \n2.  Northstar Equity Partners V Limited (NEP V, the fund) is a private equity fund established \nas a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability, with an expected size of $500 \nmillion. Northstar Capital Group V Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited \nliability, is the managing director of NEP V. The investment manager of the managing director, \nNorthstar Advisors Pte. Ltd., is a Singapore limited liability company. The managing director and \nits affiliates comprise the Northstar Group (Northstar), which was established in 2003 by co-\nfounders and managing partners Patrick Walujo and Glenn Sugita. Northstar launched its first \nprivate equity fund in 2006 and has raised about $2.3 billion of committed capital and invested \nmore than $3.8 billion (including co-investments) in 45 companies in Indonesia and Southeast \nAsia as of 30 June 2021. \n \n3.  NEP V aims to provide growth capital to 8\u201310 midsized Indonesian companies operating \nprimarily in consumer (including education, health care, and agribusiness), financial services, and \ndigital economy ([This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure \nin ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]) sectors.1 The fund may invest up to [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to \nInformation Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] of the aggregate commitments in other countries in Southeast \nAsia.2 The fund may also invest up to [This information has been removed as it falls under the \nexception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] of aggregate \ncommitments in 6\u20138 early-stage opportunities.3 \n \n4.  The  fund  will  contribute  to  Indonesia\u2019s  job  growth  by  backing  established,  growing \ncompanies in the finance sector, and possibly also companies active in health care, education, \nand agribusiness. Through investments in the finance sector, NEP V may help address the under-\npenetration of financial services in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and improve availability of \ncapital for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By investing in promising technology-\nbased  businesses  (including  those  related  to  finance,  education,  and  agriculture;  and  e-\ncommerce) NEP V will help these companies scale, operate more efficiently and cost-effectively, \nand acquire new customers. Northstar\u2019s developmental investments include (i) BTPN Syariah \n(Indonesia), a Shariah microfinance institution that targets the niche but sizable and underserved \nproductive poor segment;4 (ii) e-Fishery (Indonesia), an agriculture technology company that \n \n1  Indonesian companies are headquartered or have existing significant operations in Indonesia, or that the managing \ndirector reasonably believes will (within a 5-year period), either (i) derive at least 50% of their revenue, profit, or \nmarket value from Indonesia; or (ii) expand significantly into or source significant business from Indonesia. \n2  Southeast Asian companies are headquartered or have existing significant operations in Southeast Asia, or that the \nmanaging director reasonably believes will (within a 5-year period), either (i) derive at least 50% of their revenue, \nprofit, or market value from Southeast Asia, or (ii) expand significantly into or source significant business from \nSoutheast Asia. Southeast Asia includes Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will only participate in any investments by the fund in portfolio companies operating in \nCambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, \nand/or Viet Nam. Specifically, ADB will have excusal rights in relation to investments in Brunei Darussalam and \nSingapore (being graduated ADB developing member countries) and Myanmar. Based on discussions with Northstar, \nADB considers that the likelihood of the fund investing in Myanmar is very low. \n3  Early-stage opportunities include any investment opportunity in a portfolio company where the aggregate amount \ninvested by the fund is $15 million or less. \n4  BTPN Syariah provides financing and services such as digital banking to remote communities, and also focuses on \nproviding extensive nonfinancial services such as training in e-commerce and business skills. \n \nPUBLIC.

", "2 \nprovides an affordable, mobile-enabled fish-feeding device to help fish farmers optimize feeding \ncosts; and (iii) Zenius (Indonesia), an education technology company that provides innovative and \naffordable learning programs to address the learning gaps of Indonesian students. \n \n5.  The value addition of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment in NEP V includes \nhelping Northstar develop an environmental and social management system (ESMS) acceptable \nto ADB. Currently, Northstar maintains a basic environmental social policy, and ADB has reviewed \nand recommended actions to address numerous gaps in the policy. ADB will also require \nNorthstar to appoint a technically qualified and experienced environmental and social (E&S) \npersonnel to oversee the ESMS implementation and ensure capacity building within Northstar\u2019s \nteam and prospective investee companies. In addition, ADB will assist Northstar to promote \ngender equality across NEP V\u2019s operations by introducing and implementing a gender-lens \ninvesting approach and enhancing gender-inclusive workplace practices. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n6.  Description. Northstar is the largest private equity firm focused on Indonesia, and has the \nlongest history. It was established in 2003, and has 27 professionals based in Jakarta and \nSingapore;  including  6  investment  review  committee  (IRC)  members;  12  investment \nprofessionals; 6 legal, finance and/or investor relations professionals; and 3 dedicated in-house \noperations executives. It will maintain its focus on significant minority and control investments in \nmature  growth  companies  (with  a  small  allocation  for  investment  in  select  early-stage \nopportunities) in the areas it believes to be key drivers of growth across Indonesia and Southeast \nAsia, specifically: (i) consumers (including in education, health care, and agribusiness); (ii) \nfinancial services; and (iii) the digital economy. \n \n7.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n8.  Northstar\u2019s consumer and retail, financial services, and digital economy investments have \ngenerated strong early returns and realizations [This information has been removed as it falls \nunder the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. As a \nresult, Northstar Group has repositioned its investment strategy to focus on these three core \nsectors and included a small, opportunistic allocation to early-stage investments. This refocused \ninvestment strategy is currently being tested in NEP IV and is showing early signs of success. \n \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n9.  Investment identification. ADB first encountered Northstar in February 2015 as part of \nits private equity market-mapping due diligence and, over the next 5 years, continued to track the \nprogress of the platform through regular interactions with the Northstar team. NEP V was \nlaunched during the third quarter of 2019, and ADB\u2019s benchmarking analysis confirmed that \nNorthstar  is  the  leading  and  most  experienced  Indonesia-focused  private  equity  platform. \nIndonesia-focused peers Falcon House, Capsquare, and Saratoga are smaller and/or more \nrecently established platforms, and lack the depth of experience and network that Northstar has \nattained over its prior four fund vintages and multiple economic cycles. Regional peers Creador \nand Exacta are already part of ADB's private equity portfolio. \n \n ", "3 \n10.  Portfolio fit. The investment is well-aligned with ADB\u2019s private equity funds strategy, \nwhich seeks to support country-dedicated funds in Southeast Asia such as Northstar V in \nIndonesia, Lombard V in Thailand, Navegar II in the Philippines, and Mekong IV in Viet Nam. \nThese  countries  share  a  number  of  qualities:  favorable  demographics;  strong  growth, \nnotwithstanding the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19); and rapid growth of their \ndigital economies. Their markets also exhibit unique local needs, characteristics, and sectoral \ntrends, which locally established fund managers such as Northstar are best placed to identify and \naddress. This is particularly critical to enable early identification of promising startups, given the \nfund\u2019s focus on the digital economy within its early-stage allocation. In this context, Northstar\u2019s \nmanaging  partners  have  a  deep  network  within  Indonesia\u2019s  startup  ecosystem,  and  have \ndemonstrated their ability in NEP IV to participate in early funding rounds of promising technology \nbusinesses such as Gojek, and Bank Jago. Sourcing control transactions also requires building \nlong-term relationships with promoters and waiting for the right opportunity to be able to acquire \na business, and provides a competitive edge to local, established managers such as Northstar. \n \n11.  Market opportunity. Given its primary focus on Indonesia, the medium- to long-term \nmarket outlook for NEP V is compelling. Indonesia\u2014which has a nominal gross domestic product \n(GDP) that exceeds $1.0 trillion, and a population of around 270 million with a median age of 31 \nyears\u2014continues to be one of the largest markets in Asia and a growing and attractive market in \nSoutheast Asia.5 While the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Indonesia\u2019s first recession since \n1999, ADB expects Indonesia\u2019s economy to experience a V-shaped recovery with a forecast of \n3.5% GDP growth for 2021, and 4.8% GDP growth in 2022.6 Several recent developments \nsupport Indonesia\u2019s long-term growth prospects, including (i) the Government of Indonesia\u2019s $98 \nbillion fiscal stimulus package, the fifth-largest in Asia and the Pacific; (ii) an ambitious COVID-19 \nvaccination program that began in February 2021 and targets 181 million inoculations by early \n2022; (iii) passage of key labor market and financial reforms (collectively, the Omnibus Laws), \nwhich are expected to improve the business-enabling environment, generate jobs, and boost \ninvestor confidence; (iv) establishment of a $20 billion sovereign wealth fund to attract foreign \ninvestment to finance large infrastructure projects; and (v) a rapidly growing digital economy, with \nconsumers increasingly relying on online platforms for food delivery, groceries, education, health \nadvice, and entertainment.7 \n \n12.  Gender-lens investing. Very few firms in Southeast Asia apply a gender lens to their \ninvestments but gender-lens financing is increasing in the region.8 In Indonesia, gender-lens \ninvesting is increasingly having a significant development impact, especially in financial services, \nagriculture, and workforce development. Typically, investors understand gender-lens investing as \ndirectly financing businesses owned or led by women, and many investors report difficulty in \nfinding investable enterprises that are owned or led by women. Similarly, the most common \nstrategies  used  by  gender-lens  investors  in  Indonesia  include  providing  critical  goods  and \nservices to women and supporting businesses led and owned by women.9 As such, Northstar has \nnot previously applied a specific gender lens to its investments, apart from including gender \ndiversity among standard environment, social, and governance factors. \n \nB.

Through  equity  and  equity-linked  investments,  NEP  V  will  primarily  seek  significant \nminority and control positions in profitable and growing Indonesian companies (footnote 1) \nfocusing primarily on consumers, financial services, and the digital economy (para. 3). The fund \nexpects to construct a portfolio of 8\u201310 growth investments ($40 million\u2013$100 million each), and \n6\u20138  early-stage  investments  (generally  $2  million\u2013$15  million  each)  for  a  total  of  14\u201318 \ncompanies.

Northstar introduced the digital economy as a new focus \nsegment starting with NEP IV (a 2014 vintage), with a small allocation made towards early-stage \ninvestments to access promising start-ups.10 The flexibility to pursue early-stage deals will allow \nthe fund to access emerging companies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia that are introducing \ntechnology to transform existing or develop new business models in financial services, education, \nagribusiness, and health care.

The Assistance \n \n21.  ADB intends to make an equity investment of up to $40 million in NEP V, representing \nabout 8% of the expected fund size. ADB\u2019s investment will not exceed 25% of NEP V\u2019s total \ncommitted capital and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in NEP V. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n22.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  Exit strategy. NEP V has a 10-year term from its final closing date subject to two \nconsecutive 1-year extensions with consent of the special committee15. The exit strategies for \nNEP V\u2019s investments include public offerings on local or global stock exchanges, trade sales of \nportfolio companies to strategic buyers, and secondary sales to other private equity funds. \n \n24.  Reporting arrangements. The managing director will be required to provide ADB with \nunaudited quarterly reports, audited annual reports with financial statements, a fund overview, \nannual development effectiveness monitoring reports, and an overview of the portfolio. ADB will \nreview this information and follow up with the managing director if more information or clarification \nis needed. If the information received from the managing director raises issues that could impair  \nthe value of ADB\u2019s investment in NEP V, ADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more \nfrequent and detailed reviews. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Setting  standards.  As  Northstar\u2019s  first  multilateral  bank  or  development  financial \ninstitution investor, ADB will obligate Northstar to adopt and operate an ESMS acceptable to ADB. \nAs part of the ESMS, Northstar will be required to hire a technically qualified and experienced \nE&S personnel to oversee ESMS implementation and build E&S capacity within the Northstar \nteam and in NEP V investee companies. Northstar will also be required to identify ESMS training \nneeds and develop a training plan for its E&S personnel, and the investments and portfolio \noperations teams. ADB will, at Northstar\u2019s request, provide advice on E&S matters, as required \nduring appraisal of target investee companies. \n \n26.  Gender mainstreaming. Northstar has committed to engaging internally and with portfolio \ncompanies on gender issues with the objective of promoting greater gender equality across its \noperations. ADB is working with Northstar to design a gender action plan that the fund has agreed \nto implement, including adopting a gender-lens tool for the fund\u2019s investment process and a \n \n15 Details regarding the special committee are in Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \nPUBLIC.

ADB is providing a $40 million commitment, which is critical if the \nfund is to achieve its targeted size of $500 million. ADB\u2019s participation may also mobilize financing \nfrom other institutional and private financiers to help bridge any gaps in the fund\u2019s capital raise. \nFurther, ADB will seek a seat on the fund\u2019s special committee, which will enable ADB to help \nimprove the fund\u2019s corporate governance. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n35.  Impact. Access to growth capital for SMEs and middle-market companies in Indonesia \nand Southeast Asia (footnotes 1 and 2) improved at a time when capital availability for new \ninvestments is constrained and when financial institutions and investors are increasingly risk \naverse given uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n36.  Outcome.  Availability  of  financing  for  enterprises  focusing  on  consumer,  financial \nservices, or the digital economy businesses improved. \n \n37.  Outputs. (i) The NEP V fund is successfully established; (ii) greater gender equality at \ninvestee level is supported by NEP V; and (iii) gender equality of NEP V\u2019s operations is enhanced. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n38.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The investment in NEP V aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n16 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n2030 (i) operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities), which \nmandates ADB to undertake efforts to facilitate job creation, particularly by supporting SMEs, and \nimprove education and training outcomes; and (ii) operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in \ngender equality), which calls for scaling up support for gender equality and promoting women\u2019s \nempowerment through increasing financial inclusion, supporting women\u2019s entrepreneurship, and \naccess to job skills.17 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s efforts to address gender gaps in \naccess to financial products, notably supporting the government\u2019s recently launched first National \nWomen\u2019s Financial Inclusion Strategy (in 2020),18 which aims to accelerate access to finance for \nSMEs led by women and notably to enhance women\u2019s financial inclusion network. \n \n39.  Consistency with country strategies. The investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024, which calls for ADB to use its nonsovereign \nfinancing modalities to help catalyze private sector investments.19 \n40.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The investment in \nNEP V is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations 2019\u20132024, which \nsupports  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department\u2019s  continued  efforts  to  leverage  equity \ninvestments to support businesses serving the emerging middle class.20 \n \n41.  Lessons from previous operations. A corporate evaluation of ADB\u2019s private sector \nequity  investments  concluded  that  ADB  should  refine  its  approach  to  private  equity  fund \ninvestments to ensure their financial sustainability and to appropriately prioritize value addition \nand  development  impact.21 ADB  has  conducted extensive  due  diligence  sessions  with  the \nNorthstar team to gain comfort with the investment team\u2019s experience, the fund\u2019s investment \nstrategy, and the quality of the fund\u2019s deal pipeline to ensure that the developmental merits of the \ninvestment are compelling and achievable. Further, through interviews with the management \nteams of Northstar\u2019s portfolio companies, ADB confirmed that the Northstar investment team \nundertakes a comprehensive multistage underwriting process to ensure that an investment meets \nthe criteria for financial sustainability. These discussions also confirmed that Northstar has been \nable to tangibly add value to improve the growth prospects of the underlying businesses, which \ncan be further bolstered through adoption of the fund\u2019s ESMS. ADB conducted reference calls \nwith past and present investors of Northstar to validate the findings detailed above. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n42.
