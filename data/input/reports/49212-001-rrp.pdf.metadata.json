I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of up to $150 million (or its Indian rupee equivalent) to PNB Housing Finance \nLimited (PNBHF) in India, the proceeds of which will be exclusively used to finance prospective \nowners of individual low-cost affordable housing (LCAH) units.1  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Economy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of \n7.8% from FY2005 to FY2014, helping the country reduce poverty from 37.2% in FY2005 to \n21.9% in FY2012.2 Although India weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, growth \nslackened during FY2012\u2013FY2014 as a result of tighter monetary policy to counter persistently \nhigh inflation, lack of consensus on some policy and regulatory issues, and the adverse effects \nof a decrease in global demand.3 During FY2015, growth has rebounded, helped by increased \npolitical  certainty,  several  policy  actions,  lower  commodity  (oil  and  non-oil)  import  prices, \nimproved business and consumer confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. GDP growth \nwas 7.3% for FY2015. According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates, India\u2019s GDP \ngrowth is expected to edge up further to 8.2% in FY2016, benefiting from lower inflation, the \nresult  of  supportive  monetary  policy,  and  increased  capital  expenditure.4 The  return  to \nsustainable high growth rates, however, will be predicated on continuing to address supply-side \nbottlenecks and structural challenges through legislative changes and policy implementation.  \n \n3.  Urbanization has been an engine of growth for the Indian economy. During 2001\u20132011, \nthe  urban  population  of  India  grew  at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  2.8%, \nincreasing the level of urbanization from 27.8% to 31.2%. According to the 2011 census, India \nhad a population of 1.2 billion, out of which 377.1 million lived in urban areas.5 By 2030, 590 \nmillion people are projected to live in urban areas.6 Rapid urbanization has, however, led to land \nshortages, housing shortfalls, traffic congestion, and stress on other basic infrastructure such as \nwater and electricity in towns and cities. \n \n4.  Housing sector overview. As a result of these rapidly changing demographics, India \nsuffers from an acute shortage of adequate housing. According to the Ministry of Housing and \nUrban Poverty Alleviation, the estimated housing shortage in India was close to 60.0 million in \n2012, of which 18.8 million were in urban areas. Housing shortages are heavily skewed toward \npoor socioeconomic groups, with economically weaker sections, i.e., households with annual \nincomes of Rs100,000 or less, accounting for 56.2% of the housing shortage, while low-income \ngroups (those with annual incomes of  Rs100,000\u2013Rs200,000) accounted for 39.4% of the \nshortage.7 Limited housing supply and poor affordability have led to many lower-income people \n                                                \n1  Housing units with floor area of up to 60 square meters and cost of up to Rs3 million, and maximum loan amount of \nRs2.5 million, under Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. \n2  World Bank. 2014.

A large \nnumber are forced to occupy marginal lands with poor housing stock without sanitation facilities \nor  live  in  urban  slums.  Interest  in  constructing  housing  for  lower-  and  moderate-income \ncustomers has increased in recent years. The previous slowdown of the Indian economy and \nthe  dampened  demand  for  upscale  real  estate  development  forced  developers  to  focus \nincreasingly on affordable housing. According to Deloitte, at least 30,500 units below Rs1 million \nwere launched in 132 projects across 22 cities from June 2011 to January 2013. The potential \nfor affordable housing is compelling because of rapid urbanization, rising disposable income, \nand a preference for home ownership (for those who can afford it) in India.   \n \n5.  Financial sector overview. The Indian financial sector remains underdeveloped, with \nbanks  playing  the  dominant  role.  As  of  the  end  of  FY2014,  total  assets  of  all  scheduled \ncommercial banks stood at Rs109.6 trillion and total equity was Rs8.1 trillion, implying a system-\nwide leverage ratio of 7.4%. Public sector banks, which account for 72.7% of the banking sector \nassets, face tighter capital constraints with an average leverage ratio of 5.8%. Notwithstanding \nthe size of the banking sector, access to finance in India remains a key issue with 47.0% of \npeople  being  unbanked.8 Access  to  credit  is  even  more  limited,  with  less  than  14.0%  of \nborrowers accessing credit through formal channels.9  \n \n6.  Housing finance. Similar to the broader financial sector, India\u2019s housing finance market \nis also underdeveloped, particularly with respect to the large demand and need for housing \nfinance. Despite the doubling of total housing credit in the last 5 years to over Rs10.6 trillion, the \nmortgage penetration rate in India is very low, at 8.4% as of the end of FY2015, compared with \n20.0% in the People\u2019s Republic of China and 81.0% in the United States (US).10 While some \ncommercial banks have become active in mortgage lending, overall they have tended to play a \nmuch  smaller  role  in  the  housing  finance  market  than  their  foreign  counterparts.  Housing \nfinance companies (HFCs) also have an important role in addressing the financing gap in India. \n   \n7.  Since FY2005, the number of HFCs, their geographic coverage, and loan portfolios have \nshown considerable growth. As of  the end of FY2015, 64 HFCs were registered with the \nNational Housing Bank (NHB), the industry regulator, up from 52 in 2011. The growth in HFCs is \nlargely attributable to their focused approach, targeting of special customer segments (often \noutside urban areas) including affordable housing and the self-employed, and superior customer \nservice. 11 HFCs have increased their market share in the provision of housing finance from \n30.0% in FY2010 to 37.0% as of the end of FY2015 and this trend is expected to continue, \nalthough  commercial  banks  are  becoming  more  competitive  in  the  sector  following  recent \nregulatory changes.12 The largest five HFCs are HDFC Bank, LIC Housing Finance Limited, \n                                                \n8  World Bank.

The level of \nunbanked people in India has declined from 65% in 2011 following the launch by the government of the important \ninitiative, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme (Prime Minister's People Money Scheme), which aims to \nopen up hundreds of millions of bank accounts for poor families.  \n9 World  Bank.

Indian Mortgage Finance Market Quarter 1, 2014\u20132015. Delhi. \n11 HFCs have tended to focus their lending approach on lower value and higher volume (typically outside of major \nurban areas), leading to higher operating costs, particularly when lending to individuals in the informal sector who \ndo not have formal documentation.  \n12 The RBI issued guidelines in July 2014 providing commercial banks with incentives to issue long-term bonds for \nfinancing affordable housing. \n ", "  3 \nDewan Housing Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance, and PNB Housing Finance. As of the end \nof FY2015, the aggregate outstanding housing loan portfolio for all HFCs stood at Rs3.9 trillion \n(CAGR of 23.1% from FY2011).13  \n \n8.  Rationale. Traditionally, the private sector real estate market has focused on serving \nhigher income segments of urban India. Housing finance was also mainly geared toward higher \nincome groups, except for a few HFCs focusing on affordable housing finance. Consequently, \nreal estate owners have largely been from the middle- and high-income population, with a \nmonthly household income of at least Rs25,000, which accounts for about 8.0% of the urban \npopulation. Almost 40%\u201345% of the urban population lives in rented accommodation and would \nlike to buy their own houses. An additional 15%\u201320% of non-renting households would also like \nto buy housing to upgrade their living conditions.14 Given the urgent need for housing, the \ngovernment has placed high priority on developing this sector and has increasingly recognized \nthe role the private sector can play in addressing the housing needs of moderate to lower-\nincome customers. To encourage such participation, the government has sought to address \ncertain market constraints, such as the limited availability of long-term funding to HFCs in the \nlocal market. In 2014, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed external commercial borrowings \n(ECB) of up to $1 billion for LCAH, and a similar amount has been allocated for 2015. \n \n9.  To meet the large potential demand for affordable housing for moderate and lower \nincome households, it is important to support housing development for these segments and to \nalleviate the constraints on access to housing finance. 15 One effective way to improve access to \nhousing finance is to support strong HFCs capable of successfully reaching moderate and lower \nincome customers. ADB partnered with Dewan Housing Finance Limited, the third largest HFC, \nin 2014 to assist in the provision of LCAH. ADB identified PNBHF, the fifth largest HFC, as \nanother suitable candidate given its strong underwriting, solid asset quality, and expressed \ndesire to grow its affordable housing loan portfolio, including in several underdeveloped states.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy  \n \n10.  Overview. Founded in 1988, PNBHF is a deposit-taking HFC registered with the NHB. \nPNBHF  provides  housing  loans  to  individuals  for  the  construction,  purchase,  repair,  and \nupgrade of homes, as well as loans against property, loans for commercial property, and loans \nfor  the  purchase  of  residential  plots.  PNBHF  also  provides  non-housing  loans,  such  as \nconstruction finance loans, to developers. Among the fastest growing HFCs, PNBHF is the fifth \nlargest HFC in India in terms of assets under management, with Rs172.9 billion at the end of \nFY2015. Organized structurally into a hub and spoke model, PNBHF\u2019s network consists of 16 \nunderwriting  hubs  and  38  branches  spread  throughout  the  country.  The  company  has  its \nstrongest presence in northern India, but as part of its business strategy, it is continuing its \nexpansion into western and southern markets, specifically into tier II and tier III cities.  \n \n                                                \n13 Asset  quality  for  housing  loans  among  all  HFCs  has  improved  since  FY2011,  with  a  system-wide  gross \nnonperforming assets (NPA) ratio of 0.6% as of the end of FY2015.13 Median capital adequacy for all HFCs was \nstrong at 18.4%. The return on assets for HFCs was 2.2% while return on equity stood at 20.3% for FY2015. \n14 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India. 2013. State of the Low-Income Housing Market.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Investment for the \nShapoorji Affordable Housing Project in India. Manila. The Private Sector Operations Department received Board \napproval for this project in July 2015, which will support housing construction for low-income families. \n ", "4 \n \n11.  PNBHF\u2019s loan portfolio has more than doubled during FY2013\u2013FY2015, in line with its \nadoption of a growth-oriented business model and strategic efforts to strengthen its competitive \nposition. In FY2015, total loans increased by 58.8% to Rs168.2 billion. Housing loans comprised \nthe largest portion of the total loan portfolio at 61.6% as of the end of FY2015, of which LCAH \nloans represented 18.0% (10.6% of the total loan portfolio). PNBHF sees this as a growth \nopportunity and seeks to increase LCAH loans as a percentage of housing loans to 30.0% \nduring the next few years. Non-housing loans, including construction finance, accounted for the \nremaining 38.4% of the total loan portfolio.  \n \n12.  Business  strategy.  Following  its  strategic  partnership  in  2009  with  Destimoney \nEnterprises Private Limited (Destimoney), the Indian arm of Destimoney Enterprises, a new \nmanagement team  was  brought  into  PNBHF. In  2011, the management  team  launched  a \ncomprehensive  business  process  transformation  and  reengineering  exercise,  branded  as \nProject Kshitij, to strengthen PNBHF\u2019s business and financial risk profiles by establishing a \nrobust,  growth-oriented  business  model.  Under  this  initiative,  the  company\u2019s  business \nprocesses, organizational structure, and policies were revamped and a new business plan was \nformulated to enhance PNBHF\u2019s competitive positioning and scale of operations. As part of the \nnew strategy, PNBHF\u2019s customer focus has been refined\u2014now targeting the emerging middle \nclass\u2014servicing  self-employed  professionals  and  nonprofessionals  as  well  as  salaried \nemployees for its housing loans. Affordable housing loans are considered a subcategory within \nthis general customer focus.  \n \n13.  PNBHF has set a long-term target to become one of the top three HFCs. It expects the \nhousing finance market to grow significantly over the coming years because of a number of \nmacro  factors  and  demographic  trends,  including  government  efforts  to  increase  home \nownership, projected softening of interest rates, and increasing demand for housing loans. \nPNBHF\u2019s new hub and spoke organizational structure is scalable and positions the company to \nbenefit from sector growth. PNBHF intends to deepen its reach in existing regions as well as \nexpanding to new regions\u2014opening eight new branches in FY2015 with another eight planned \nin FY2016. Further expansion of its distribution network will quicken in subsequent years as it \nenlarges its market footprint.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n14.  Ownership. Prior to 2009, PNBHF was solely owned by Punjab National Bank (PNB), \nthe fourth largest state-owned bank in India (in terms of total assets). In December 2009, PNB \nentered into a strategic partnership with Destimoney, which acquired a 49.0% shareholding in \nPNBHF.16 In February 2015, Destimoney was purchased by The Carlyle Group (TCG), 17 a US-\nbased global alternative asset manager, 18 and assumed the shareholding in PNBHF.19 As of 30 \nJune 2015, PNB had a majority 51.0% stake in PNBHF, with TCG holding the remaining 49.0% \ninterest.    \n                                                \n16 Destimoney Enterprises is a financial services company in India, established in 2006 by New Silk Route\u2014a leading \nAsia-focused  growth  capital  firm  also  founded  in  2006,  with  $1.5  billion  under  management.  Destimoney \nEnterprises Private Limited was a subsidiary of Destimoney Enterprises before being sold to The Carlyle Group.  \n17 Founded in 1987 in Washington, DC, TCG is one of the world\u2019s largest and most successful investment firms, with \nmore than $194 billion of assets under management across 128 funds and 142 fund vehicles. \n18 Several issues relating to TCG and its investments have been identified and flagged in the checklists. However, \nbecause of the remoteness of the issues from PNBHF and the lack of corroboratory information, these pose little \nintegrity risk to ADB. \n19 Acquisition of Destimoney by TCG was undertaken by a wholly owned TCG subsidiary, Quality Investment \nHoldings, a Mauritius-based entity. \n ", "  5 \n15.  Management  and  governance  structure.  PNBHF is controlled by a  nine member \nboard of directors, all with considerable professional expertise in banking, finance, and/or the \nmortgage industry. Three of the nine members are independent. Of the remaining six members, \nthree are nominees of PNB, two are nominees of TCG, and one is an executive director\u2014the \nmanaging director of PNBHF. The board is responsible for strategic direction, policy setting, and \nsupervising  PNBHF\u2019s  performance,  as  well  as  ensuring  its  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations. The board is supported by a system of appointed committees and subcommittees. \nIn keeping with the private partnership model adopted in 2009, following the investment by \nDestimoney, PNBHF is managed by an independent team of experienced professionals with \nyears of involvement in the housing finance sector.  \n \n16.  Risk management. Under the hub and spoke model, branches focus on origination, \ncollection, and customer service, while credit underwriting, administration, and monitoring is \ncentralized and carried out at the regional hubs. As part of PNBHF\u2019s enhancement to its credit \nrisk management system, specialized vertical functional units, such as the Technical Service \nGroup,  Legal  Appraisal  Unit,  Fraud  Control  Unit,  and Wholesale  Finance  Unit,  have  been \nestablished. 20 In addition, a specialized Recoveries Unit was created to steer the monitoring \nand  workout  of  problem  loans.  The  board\u2019s  Credit  Committee  oversees  the  credit  risk \nmanagement function. Operational risk management is carried out through a comprehensive \nsystem of internal controls, separation of duties between key functions, and detailed standard \noperating procedures. PNBHF has just updated its information technology platform (enterprise \ncore  business  suite),  which  automates  all  operations  into  a  centralized  system  for  timely \nmanagement information system and reporting. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n17.  Capital  adequacy.  As  of  the  end  of  FY2015,  PNBHF  had  total  net  worth  of \nRs15.8 billion and adequate capitalization, with a tier 1 capital ratio of 10.4% and a capital \nadequacy ratio of 13.8%, higher than the NHB requirements of 12.0% and an increase from the \n13.0% recorded in FY2014. PNBHF\u2019s capital position was strengthened during FY2015 as a \nresult of a Rs7.0 billion rights issue from existing shareholders as a means to support loan \nportfolio growth. An additional Rs3.0 billion from this rights issue is expected to be infused \nduring FY2016. The shareholders plan to undertake another rights issue in FY2016 to raise a \nfurther Rs5.0 billion. In addition to increasing share capital, PNBHF also has room to raise tier II \ncapital to shore up its capital adequacy.  \n \n18.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. PNBHF\u2019s loan portfolio has grown rapidly during the \npast 3 years (CAGR of 59.4% for FY2013\u2013FY2015), increasing by 58.8% in FY2015 alone to \nRs168.2 billion. Housing loans (inclusive of LCAH loans), the largest portion of the total loan \nportfolio at 61.6%, showed the strongest growth, rising by 60.3% in FY2015. Non-housing loans \n(including construction finance), which comprised the remaining 38.4%, rose by 55.1%. Despite \nrapid loan growth, PNBHF\u2019s asset quality has steadily improved since FY2011 as the company \noverhauled its credit risk management framework and intensified collection efforts and the focus \non recoveries in the older portion of the portfolio.  \n \n                                                \n20 The Technical Services Group oversees property valuations, approvals for developers\u2019 projects, and monitoring of \napproved projects. The Legal Appraisal Unit consists of legal experts that work to establish clear title to the \nproperty being financed. The Fraud Control Unit conducts fraud reviews all loan applications. The Wholesale \nFinance Unit oversees the underwriting of wholesale construction finance. \n ", "6 \n \n19.  Liquidity  and  funding  gap.  PNBHF  has  a fairly  diversified funding  profile, raising \nmoney from  a  mix  of retail  deposits,  bank  borrowings, refinancing from  NHB,  and  market \nborrowings. PNBHF\u2019s liquidity profile has been stable, with the liquid assets\u2013short-term liability \nratio being fairly steady at 32.0%.  \n \n20.  Earnings performance. PNBHF has seen a steady rise in profitability during FY2013\u2013\nFY2015, in line with its high growth business model, as operating revenues have paralleled \nexpansion of the loan portfolio and been bolstered by a higher than the industry average (3.0%) \nnet interest margin of 3.2% in both FY2014 and FY2015. Net income increased by 39.2% in \nFY2014 to Rs1.3 billion and by a further 53.9% to Rs1.9 billion as of the end of FY2015. Despite \nthis sizable increase, PNBHF\u2019s overall profitability has been offset by the higher operating \nexpenses  associated  with  the  implementation  of  Project  Kshitij,  including  substantial \ninvestments in information technology systems, infrastructure, and human capital, as well as the \nexpansion of its distribution network. The return on assets fell slightly to 1.28% as of the end of \nFY2015 from 1.31% as of the end of FY2014, as asset growth outpaced the increase in net \nincome. Similarly, the return on equity declined from 16.39% in FY2014 to 15.59% at the end of \nFY2015 as a result of the rise in total equity outstripping that of net income.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n21.  ADB will provide a senior secured term loan to PNBHF of up to $150 million (or its Indian \nrupee equivalent). 21 The tenor of the loan will be up to 7 years from the date of the first \ndisbursement of the loan. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance purchases by \nprospective  owners  of  LCAH  units  in  India.  In  accordance  with  applicable  NHB  and  RBI \nregulations, LCAH is defined as housing units with a maximum floor area of 60 square meters \nand a maximum cost of Rs3 million. LCAH loans to individual sub-borrowers are subject to a \ncap of Rs2.5 million. Upwards of 40% of the proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance \nsub-borrowers in some of India\u2019s least-developed states, including Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, \nJharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Odisha,  Rajasthan,  Uttarakhand,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West \nBengal. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Use of proceeds. The use of proceeds will follow the RBI regulation on ECB. PNBHF \nwill use the proceeds of the ADB loan exclusively to finance LCAH unit owners\u2019 mortgage loans. \n \n23.  Monitoring.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  carry  out  project \nmonitoring. PNBHF will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand as requested. These will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, \n(ii) audited financial statements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates for financial \ncovenants on a quarterly basis, (iv) reporting on the mortgage portfolio on a semiannual basis, \nand (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n                                                \n21 The loan will be secured by PNBHF\u2019s a portfolio of mortgage receivables.  \n ", "  7 \n24.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly and at \nleast  annually.22 The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Providing  long-term  financing  for  low-cost  affordable  housing. The project will \nprovide  needed  long-term  funding  to  support  the  scaling  up  of  PNBHF\u2019s  operations  in \nunderserved  market  segments.  India\u2019s  capital  markets  are  still  in  the  early  stages  of \ndevelopment and access to long-term funding is a challenge for HFCs.23 The funding bottleneck \nhampers the HFCs\u2019 growth and the affordability of mortgage loans\u2014particularly in their LCAH \nfinance business because of the lower profit margins. The government has recognized this \nmarket constraint and, given that this is a priority sector, the RBI provided a $1 billion ECB \nquota for LCAH in 2014 and another $1 billion in 2015. International commercial banks are not \nwilling to lend for longer tenors and the appetite for longer tenor bonds among private sector \ninvestors decreases drastically as the tenor of bonds increase. 24 ADB is thus filling this market \ngap.  \n \n26.  Supporting the housing sector. This project will support housing sector development, \nwhich  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  by  generating  employment, \nimproving housing, and raising standards of living. Housing finance also helps develop the \nfinancial sector by improving its overall depth, diversity, buoyancy, and resilience.  \n \nRisks (Deleted) \n \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n27.  Development  impact.  Developing  the  housing  finance  market  and  increasing  the \nprovision of and private sector investments in low-cost affordable housing are aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017, which highlights the impact of housing sector \ndevelopment  in  promoting  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  through  employment \ngeneration,  improved  housing,  and  higher  standards  of  living.25 Housing  is  also  a  strong \ncontributor to GDP growth.26   \n \n28.  Outcome. The expected outcome of the project will be that PNBHF\u2019s lending activities \nfor low-cost affordable housing in India will be demonstrated to be sustainable. \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2013.

PNBHF can mobilize deposits, but these tend to be short-term.  \n24 Data accessed in September 2015 from Prime Database shows that only 35% of the bonds issued with maturities \nbetween 3-7 years were from private financial institutions, while at 7 years and longer, the number of financial \ninstitutions able to access the capital markets falls to just 10%. \n25 Government of India.

The expected output of the project will be to increase financing for LCAHs \nthrough PNBHF as evidenced by (i) PNBHF\u2019s number of low-cost affordable housing loans \nincreasing from 21,830 in FY2015 to 30,400 in FY2022, (ii) PNBHF\u2019s portfolio of LCAH loans \nincreasing from Rs23,241 million to Rs32,733 million by FY2022, and (iii) at least 30.0% of the \nnew low-cost affordable housing allocated to women named on the title as owner or joint owner. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n30.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the financial sector \nby  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.  The \nproposed project contributes to financial sector development by supporting the growth of HFCs, \nan important component of the nonbank financial sector in India. Strategy 2020 also seeks to \npromote inclusive growth.27 Without access to formal financial services, lower income people or \nunderserved segments will be excluded from the growth process and its benefits. Under the \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020, cities also constitute a key focus in terms of promoting livable \ncities  that  are  competitive  and  environmentally  attractive.  According  to  the  India  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue to support the \ninfrastructure and financial sectors by undertaking selective projects for physical and social \ninfrastructure and financial infrastructure.28 The proposed project will support the development \nof  housing  finance  in  India,  one  of  the  financial  infrastructures  identified  in  the  country \npartnership strategy and a high priority for the government with growing emphasis on including \nprivate sector financing. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  The project is classified category FI (treated as C) for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The project is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. PNBHF \nwill not finance real estate development or mass housing construction. It will use ADB\u2019s loan to \nfund mortgage loans to individuals, primarily in urban and semiurban areas. No land acquisition \nor physical or economic displacements are expected from the activities of the borrower, since \nthe housing loans will be provided to individuals who have purchased the property with  a \nmortgage or are voluntarily making improvements to their dwellings. The project is not expected \nto have impacts on indigenous peoples. The investment\u2019s potential environment and social \nimpacts, the risks associated with the borrower\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management, have been assessed. \nPNBHF will enhance its staff capacity to carry out the assessment and oversight of the progress \nof the  environmental  (including  climate  change)  and  social  risks  screening and  monitoring \neffectively.  PNBHF  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list29 and  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with applicable national laws and regulations and with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Social Protection Strategy.30 Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2014.

The borrower will comply with national labor laws and internationally recognized core \nlabor standards. PNBHF is an equal opportunity employer and has a gender-equal human \nresource policy. The transaction is classified as some gender elements under ADB\u2019s guidelines. \nAt least 30% of the new home loans funded by the project will be to women borrowers who have \neither single or joint (with husband) ownership and title of property.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  PNBHF was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \nIndia is a jurisdiction in which no strategic deficiencies have been identified by the Financial \nAction Task Force and no integrity red flag has been identified. \n \nC.

Assurances \n \n35.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),31 the Government of India will be requested to establish the no objection of India to the \nproposed assistance to PNBHF. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$150,000,000 (or in Indian rupee equivalent) to PNB Housing Finance Limited for the Low-Cost \nAffordable Housing Finance in India, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may \nbe reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n16 November 2015 \n \n                                                \n31 ADB. 1966.
