Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of \n7.8%  from  FY2005  to  FY2014,  helping  the  country  reduce  poverty  from  37.2%  in  FY2005  to \n21.9%  in  FY2012.2 Although  India  weathered  the  global  financial  crisis  relatively  well,  growth \nslackened during FY2012\u2013FY2014 as a result of tighter monetary policy to counter persistently \nhigh inflation, lack of consensus on some policy and regulatory issues, and the adverse effects \nof a decrease in global demand.3 During FY2015, growth has rebounded, helped by increased \npolitical  certainty,  several  policy  actions,  lower  commodity  (oil  and  non-oil)  import  prices, \nimproved business and consumer confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. GDP growth \nwas  7.3%  for  FY2015.  According  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates,  India\u2019s  GDP \ngrowth  is  expected  to  edge  up  further  to  8.2%  in  FY2016,  benefiting  from  lower  inflation,  the \nresult  of  supportive  monetary  policy,  and  increased  capital  expenditure. 4  The  return  to \nsustainable high growth rates, however, will be predicated on continuing to address supply-side \nbottlenecks and structural challenges through legislative changes and policy implementation.  \n \n3. \nUrbanization has been an engine of growth for the Indian economy. During 2001\u20132011, \nthe  urban  population  of  India  grew  at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  2.8%, \nincreasing the level of urbanization from 27.8% to 31.2%. According to the 2011 census, India \nhad  a  population  of  1.2  billion,  out  of  which  377.1  million  lived  in  urban  areas.5 By  2030,  590 \nmillion people are projected to live in urban areas.6 Rapid urbanization has, however, led to land \nshortages, housing shortfalls, traffic congestion, and stress on other basic infrastructure such as \nwater and electricity in towns and cities. \n \n4. \nHousing  sector  overview.  As  a  result  of  these  rapidly  changing  demographics,  India \nsuffers from an acute shortage of adequate housing. According to the  Ministry of Housing and \nUrban Poverty Alleviation, the estimated housing shortage in India was close to 60.0 million in \n2012, of which 18.8 million were in urban areas. Housing shortages are heavily skewed toward \npoor  socioeconomic  groups,  with  economically  weaker  sections,  i.e.,  households  with  annual \nincomes of Rs100,000 or less, accounting for 56.2% of the housing shortage, while low-income \ngroups  (those  with  annual  incomes  of  Rs100,000\u2013Rs200,000)  accounted  for  39.4%  of  the \nshortage.7 Limited housing supply and poor affordability have led to many lower-income people \n                                                \n1  Housing units with floor area of up to 60 square meters and cost of up to Rs3 million, and maximum loan amount of \n\nRs2.5 million, under Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. \n\n2  World Bank. 2014.

A  large \nnumber are forced to occupy marginal lands with poor housing stock without sanitation facilities \nor  live  in  urban  slums.  Interest  in  constructing  housing  for  lower-  and  moderate-income \ncustomers  has  increased  in  recent  years.  The  previous  slowdown  of  the  Indian  economy  and \nthe  dampened  demand  for  upscale  real  estate  development  forced  developers  to  focus \nincreasingly on affordable housing. According to Deloitte, at least 30,500 units below Rs1 million \nwere launched in 132 projects across 22 cities from June 2011 to January 2013. The potential \nfor  affordable  housing  is  compelling  because  of  rapid  urbanization,  rising  disposable  income, \nand a preference for home ownership (for those who can afford it) in India.   \n \n5. \nFinancial  sector  overview.  The  Indian  financial  sector  remains  underdeveloped,  with \nbanks  playing  the  dominant  role.  As  of  the  end  of  FY2014,  total  assets  of  all  scheduled \ncommercial banks stood at Rs109.6 trillion and total equity was Rs8.1 trillion, implying a system-\nwide leverage ratio of 7.4%. Public sector banks, which account for 72.7% of the banking sector \nassets, face tighter capital constraints with an average leverage ratio of 5.8%. Notwithstanding \nthe  size  of  the  banking  sector,  access  to  finance  in  India  remains  a  key  issue  with  47.0%  of \npeople  being  unbanked. 8  Access  to  credit  is  even  more  limited,  with  less  than  14.0%  of \nborrowers accessing credit through formal channels.9  \n \nHousing finance. Similar to the broader financial sector, India\u2019s housing finance market \n6. \nis  also  underdeveloped,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  large  demand  and  need  for  housing \nfinance. Despite the doubling of total housing credit in the last 5 years to over Rs10.6 trillion, the \nmortgage penetration rate in India is very low, at 8.4% as of the end of FY2015, compared with \n20.0%  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  81.0%  in  the  United  States  (US).10 While  some \ncommercial banks have become active in mortgage lending, overall they have tended to play a \nmuch  smaller  role  in  the  housing  finance  market  than  their  foreign  counterparts.  Housing \nfinance companies (HFCs) also have an important role in addressing the financing gap in India. \n   \n7. \nSince FY2005, the number of HFCs, their geographic coverage, and loan portfolios have \nshown  considerable  growth.  As  of  the  end  of  FY2015,  64  HFCs  were  registered  with  the \nNational Housing Bank (NHB), the industry regulator, up from 52 in 2011. The growth in HFCs is \nlargely  attributable  to  their  focused  approach,  targeting  of  special  customer  segments  (often \noutside urban areas) including affordable housing and the self-employed, and superior customer \nservice. 11 HFCs  have  increased  their  market  share  in  the  provision  of  housing  finance  from \n30.0%  in  FY2010  to  37.0%  as  of  the  end  of  FY2015  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  continue, \nalthough  commercial  banks  are  becoming  more  competitive  in  the  sector  following  recent \nregulatory  changes.12 The  largest  five  HFCs  are  HDFC  Bank,  LIC  Housing  Finance  Limited, \n\n                                                \n8  World Bank.

The level of \nunbanked people in India has declined from 65% in 2011 following the launch by the government of the important \ninitiative,  the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme (Prime Minister's People  Money Scheme), which aims to \nopen up hundreds of millions of bank accounts for poor families.  \n\n9  World  Bank.

Indian Mortgage Finance Market Quarter 1, 2014\u20132015. Delhi. \n11 HFCs  have  tended  to  focus  their  lending  approach  on  lower  value  and higher  volume  (typically  outside  of major \nurban areas), leading to higher operating costs, particularly when lending to individuals in the informal sector who \ndo not have formal documentation.  \n\n12 The  RBI  issued  guidelines  in  July  2014 providing  commercial  banks  with  incentives  to  issue  long-term  bonds  for \n\nfinancing affordable housing. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nDewan Housing Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance, and PNB Housing Finance. As of the end \nof FY2015, the aggregate outstanding housing loan portfolio for all HFCs stood at Rs3.9 trillion \n(CAGR of 23.1% from FY2011).13  \n \nRationale.  Traditionally,  the  private  sector  real  estate  market  has  focused  on  serving \n8. \nhigher income segments of urban India. Housing finance was also mainly geared toward higher \nincome groups,  except for  a few  HFCs focusing  on  affordable  housing finance.  Consequently, \nreal  estate  owners  have  largely  been  from  the  middle-  and  high-income  population,  with  a \nmonthly  household  income  of  at  least  Rs25,000,  which  accounts  for  about  8.0%  of  the  urban \npopulation. Almost 40%\u201345% of the urban population lives in rented accommodation and would \nlike to buy their own houses. An additional 15%\u201320% of non-renting households would also like \nto  buy  housing  to  upgrade  their  living  conditions. 14 Given  the  urgent  need  for  housing,  the \ngovernment has placed high priority on developing this sector and has increasingly recognized \nthe  role  the  private  sector  can  play  in  addressing  the  housing  needs  of  moderate  to  lower-\nincome  customers.  To  encourage  such  participation,  the  government  has  sought  to  address \ncertain market  constraints,  such  as  the  limited  availability  of  long-term  funding  to  HFCs  in  the \nlocal market. In 2014, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed external commercial borrowings \n(ECB) of up to $1 billion for LCAH, and a similar amount has been allocated for 2015. \n \n9. \nTo  meet  the  large  potential  demand  for  affordable  housing  for  moderate  and  lower \nincome households, it is important to support housing development for these segments and to \nalleviate the constraints on access to housing finance. 15 One effective way to improve access to \nhousing finance is to support strong HFCs capable of successfully reaching moderate and lower \nincome customers. ADB partnered with Dewan Housing Finance Limited, the third largest HFC, \nin  2014  to  assist  in  the  provision  of  LCAH.  ADB  identified  PNBHF,  the  fifth  largest  HFC,  as \nanother  suitable  candidate  given  its  strong  underwriting,  solid  asset  quality,  and  expressed \ndesire to grow its affordable housing loan portfolio, including in several underdeveloped states.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nOverview.  Founded in 1988, PNBHF is a deposit-taking HFC registered with the NHB. \nPNBHF  provides  housing  loans  to  individuals  for  the  construction,  purchase,  repair,  and \nupgrade of homes, as well as loans against property, loans for commercial property, and loans \nfor  the  purchase  of  residential  plots.  PNBHF  also  provides  non-housing  loans,  such  as \nconstruction finance loans, to developers. Among the fastest growing HFCs, PNBHF is the fifth \nlargest  HFC  in India in terms  of  assets  under management,  with  Rs172.9 billion  at  the  end  of \nFY2015.  Organized  structurally  into  a  hub  and  spoke  model,  PNBHF\u2019s  network  consists  of  16 \nunderwriting  hubs  and  38  branches  spread  throughout  the  country.  The  company  has  its \nstrongest  presence  in  northern  India,  but  as  part  of  its  business  strategy,  it  is  continuing  its \nexpansion into western and southern markets, specifically into tier II and tier III cities.  \n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy  \n\n                                                \n13  Asset  quality  for  housing  loans  among  all  HFCs  has  improved  since  FY2011,  with  a  system-wide  gross \nnonperforming assets (NPA) ratio of 0.6% as of the end of FY2015.13 Median capital adequacy for all HFCs was \nstrong at 18.4%. The return on assets for HFCs was 2.2% while return on equity stood at 20.3% for FY2015. \n\n14 Deloitte  Touche  Tohmatsu  India.  2013.  State  of  the  Low-Income  Housing  Market.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Investment for the \nShapoorji Affordable Housing Project in India.  Manila. The Private Sector Operations Department received Board \napproval for this project in July 2015, which will support housing construction for low-income families. \n\n \n\n\fPNBHF\u2019s  loan  portfolio  has  more  than  doubled  during  FY2013\u2013FY2015,  in  line  with  its \n11. \nadoption of a growth-oriented business model and strategic efforts to strengthen its competitive \nposition. In FY2015, total loans increased by 58.8% to Rs168.2 billion. Housing loans comprised \nthe largest portion of the total loan portfolio at 61.6% as of the end of FY2015, of which LCAH \nloans  represented  18.0%  (10.6%  of  the  total  loan  portfolio).  PNBHF  sees  this  as  a  growth \nopportunity  and  seeks  to  increase  LCAH  loans  as  a  percentage  of  housing  loans  to  30.0% \nduring the next few years. Non-housing loans, including construction finance, accounted for the \nremaining 38.4% of the total loan portfolio.  \n \n12. \nBusiness  strategy.  Following  its  strategic  partnership  in  2009  with  Destimoney \nEnterprises  Private  Limited  (Destimoney),  the  Indian  arm  of  Destimoney  Enterprises,  a  new \nmanagement  team  was  brought  into  PNBHF.  In  2011,  the  management  team  launched  a \ncomprehensive  business  process  transformation  and  reengineering  exercise,  branded  as \nProject  Kshitij,  to  strengthen  PNBHF\u2019s  business  and  financial  risk  profiles  by  establishing  a \nrobust,  growth-oriented  business  model.  Under  this  initiative,  the  company\u2019s  business \nprocesses, organizational structure, and policies were revamped and a new business plan was \nformulated to enhance PNBHF\u2019s competitive positioning and scale of operations. As part of the \nnew  strategy,  PNBHF\u2019s customer focus  has  been  refined\u2014now  targeting  the  emerging middle \nclass\u2014servicing  self-employed  professionals  and  nonprofessionals  as  well  as  salaried \nemployees for its housing loans. Affordable housing loans are considered a subcategory within \nthis general customer focus.  \n \n13. \nPNBHF has set a long-term target to become one of the top three HFCs. It expects the \nhousing  finance  market  to  grow  significantly  over  the  coming  years  because  of  a  number  of \nmacro  factors  and  demographic  trends,  including  government  efforts  to  increase  home \nownership,  projected  softening  of  interest  rates,  and  increasing  demand  for  housing  loans. \nPNBHF\u2019s new hub and spoke organizational structure is scalable and positions the company to \nbenefit  from  sector  growth.  PNBHF  intends  to  deepen  its  reach  in  existing  regions  as  well  as \nexpanding to new regions\u2014opening eight new branches in FY2015 with another eight planned \nin FY2016.  Further  expansion  of  its  distribution  network  will  quicken  in subsequent  years  as  it \nenlarges its market footprint.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOwnership.  Prior  to  2009,  PNBHF  was  solely  owned  by  Punjab  National  Bank  (PNB), \nthe fourth largest state-owned bank in India (in terms of total assets). In December 2009, PNB \nentered  into  a  strategic  partnership  with  Destimoney,  which  acquired  a  49.0%  shareholding  in \nPNBHF.16 In February 2015, Destimoney was purchased by The Carlyle Group (TCG), 17 a US-\nbased global alternative asset manager, 18 and assumed the shareholding in PNBHF.19 As of 30 \nJune 2015, PNB had a majority 51.0% stake in PNBHF, with TCG holding the remaining 49.0% \ninterest.    \n                                                \n16 Destimoney Enterprises is a financial services company in India, established in 2006 by New Silk Route\u2014a leading \nAsia-focused  growth  capital  firm  also  founded  in  2006,  with  $1.5  billion  under  management.  Destimoney \nEnterprises Private Limited was a subsidiary of Destimoney Enterprises before being sold to The Carlyle Group.  \n17 Founded in 1987 in Washington, DC, TCG is one of the world\u2019s largest and most successful investment firms, with \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nmore than $194 billion of assets under management across 128 funds and 142 fund vehicles. \n\n18 Several  issues  relating to  TCG  and  its  investments have  been  identified  and  flagged  in  the  checklists.  However, \nbecause of the remoteness of the issues from PNBHF and the lack of corroboratory information, these pose little \nintegrity risk to ADB. \n\n19  Acquisition  of  Destimoney  by  TCG  was  undertaken  by  a  wholly  owned  TCG  subsidiary,  Quality  Investment \n\nHoldings, a Mauritius-based entity. \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n15.  Management  and  governance  structure.  PNBHF  is  controlled  by  a  nine  member \nboard  of  directors,  all  with  considerable  professional  expertise  in  banking,  finance,  and/or  the \nmortgage industry. Three of the nine members are independent. Of the remaining six members, \nthree  are  nominees  of  PNB,  two are  nominees  of TCG,  and  one  is  an  executive  director\u2014the \nmanaging director of PNBHF. The board is responsible for strategic direction, policy setting, and \nsupervising  PNBHF\u2019s  performance,  as  well  as  ensuring  its  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations. The board is supported by a system of appointed committees and subcommittees. \nIn  keeping  with  the  private  partnership  model  adopted  in  2009,  following  the  investment  by \nDestimoney,  PNBHF  is  managed  by  an  independent  team  of  experienced  professionals  with \nyears of involvement in the housing finance sector.  \n \n16. \nRisk  management.  Under  the  hub  and  spoke  model,  branches  focus  on  origination, \ncollection,  and  customer  service,  while  credit  underwriting,  administration,  and  monitoring  is \ncentralized and carried out at the regional hubs. As part of PNBHF\u2019s enhancement to its credit \nrisk  management  system,  specialized  vertical  functional  units,  such  as  the  Technical  Service \nGroup,  Legal  Appraisal  Unit,  Fraud  Control  Unit,  and  Wholesale  Finance  Unit,  have  been \nestablished. 20 In  addition,  a  specialized  Recoveries  Unit  was  created  to  steer  the  monitoring \nand  workout  of  problem  loans.  The  board\u2019s  Credit  Committee  oversees  the  credit  risk \nmanagement  function.  Operational  risk  management  is  carried  out  through  a  comprehensive \nsystem  of  internal  controls,  separation  of  duties  between key  functions,  and  detailed  standard \noperating  procedures.  PNBHF has just  updated its  information technology  platform (enterprise \ncore  business  suite),  which  automates  all  operations  into  a  centralized  system  for  timely \nmanagement information system and reporting. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nCapital  adequacy.  As  of  the  end  of  FY2015,  PNBHF  had  total  net  worth  of \nRs15.8 billion  and  adequate  capitalization,  with  a  tier  1  capital  ratio  of  10.4%  and  a  capital \nadequacy ratio of 13.8%, higher than the NHB requirements of 12.0% and an increase from the \n13.0%  recorded  in  FY2014.  PNBHF\u2019s  capital  position  was  strengthened  during  FY2015  as  a \nresult  of  a  Rs7.0  billion  rights  issue  from  existing  shareholders  as  a  means  to  support  loan \nportfolio  growth.  An  additional  Rs3.0  billion  from  this  rights  issue  is  expected  to  be  infused \nduring  FY2016. The  shareholders  plan to undertake another  rights  issue  in FY2016  to raise a \nfurther Rs5.0 billion. In addition to increasing share capital, PNBHF also has room to raise tier II \ncapital to shore up its capital adequacy.  \n \nLoan portfolio and asset quality. PNBHF\u2019s loan portfolio has grown rapidly during the \n18. \npast  3  years  (CAGR  of 59.4%  for  FY2013\u2013FY2015),  increasing  by  58.8%  in  FY2015  alone  to \nRs168.2  billion.  Housing  loans  (inclusive  of  LCAH  loans),  the  largest  portion  of  the  total  loan \nportfolio at 61.6%, showed the strongest growth, rising by 60.3% in FY2015. Non-housing loans \n(including construction finance), which comprised the remaining 38.4%, rose by 55.1%. Despite \nrapid loan growth, PNBHF\u2019s asset quality has steadily improved since FY2011 as the company \noverhauled its credit risk management framework and intensified collection efforts and the focus \non recoveries in the older portion of the portfolio.  \n \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n                                                \n20 The Technical Services Group oversees property valuations, approvals for developers\u2019 projects, and monitoring of \napproved  projects.  The  Legal  Appraisal  Unit  consists  of  legal  experts  that  work  to  establish  clear  title  to  the \nproperty  being  financed.  The  Fraud  Control  Unit  conducts  fraud  reviews  all  loan  applications.  The  Wholesale \nFinance Unit oversees the underwriting of wholesale construction finance. \n\n \n\n\fLiquidity  and  funding  gap.  PNBHF  has  a  fairly  diversified  funding  profile,  raising \n19. \nmoney  from  a  mix  of  retail  deposits,  bank  borrowings,  refinancing  from  NHB,  and  market \nborrowings. PNBHF\u2019s liquidity profile has been stable, with the liquid assets\u2013short-term liability \nratio being fairly steady at 32.0%.  \n \n20. \nEarnings  performance. PNBHF has seen a steady rise in profitability during FY2013\u2013\nFY2015,  in  line  with  its  high  growth  business  model,  as  operating  revenues  have  paralleled \nexpansion of the loan portfolio and been bolstered by a higher than the industry average (3.0%) \nnet  interest  margin  of  3.2%  in  both  FY2014  and  FY2015.  Net  income  increased  by  39.2%  in \nFY2014 to Rs1.3 billion and by a further 53.9% to Rs1.9 billion as of the end of FY2015. Despite \nthis  sizable  increase,  PNBHF\u2019s  overall  profitability  has  been  offset  by  the  higher  operating \nexpenses  associated  with \nincluding  substantial \ninvestments in information technology systems, infrastructure, and human capital, as well as the \nexpansion of its distribution network. The return on assets fell slightly to 1.28% as of the end of \nFY2015  from  1.31%  as  of  the  end  of  FY2014,  as  asset  growth  outpaced  the  increase  in  net \nincome. Similarly, the return on equity declined from 16.39% in FY2014 to 15.59% at the end of \nFY2015 as a result of the rise in total equity outstripping that of net income.  \n \n\nimplementation  of  Project  Kshitij, \n\nthe \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nADB will provide a senior secured term loan to PNBHF of up to $150 million (or its Indian \nrupee  equivalent).  21 The  tenor  of  the  loan  will  be  up  to  7  years  from  the  date  of  the  first \ndisbursement of the loan. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance purchases by \nprospective  owners  of  LCAH  units  in  India.  In  accordance  with  applicable  NHB  and  RBI \nregulations, LCAH is defined as housing units with a maximum floor area of 60 square meters \nand  a  maximum  cost  of  Rs3  million.  LCAH  loans  to  individual  sub-borrowers  are  subject  to  a \ncap of Rs2.5 million. Upwards of 40% of the proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance \nsub-borrowers in some of India\u2019s least-developed states, including Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, \nJharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Odisha,  Rajasthan,  Uttarakhand,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West \nBengal. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nUse  of  proceeds. The use of proceeds will follow the RBI regulation on ECB.  PNBHF \nwill use the proceeds of the ADB loan exclusively to finance LCAH unit owners\u2019 mortgage loans. \n \n23.  Monitoring.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  carry  out  project \nmonitoring.  PNBHF  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals \nand  as  requested.  These  will  include  (i)  unaudited  financial  statements  on  a  quarterly  basis, \n(ii) audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial \ncovenants on a quarterly basis, (iv) reporting on the mortgage portfolio on a semiannual basis, \nand (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n21 The loan will be secured by PNBHF\u2019s a portfolio of mortgage receivables.  \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nEvaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly and at \n24. \nleast  annually. 22  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nProviding  long-term  financing  for  low-cost  affordable  housing.  The  project  will \nprovide  needed  long-term  funding  to  support  the  scaling  up  of  PNBHF\u2019s  operations  in \nunderserved  market  segments.  India\u2019s  capital  markets  are  still  in  the  early  stages  of \ndevelopment and access to long-term funding is a challenge for HFCs.23 The funding bottleneck \nhampers  the  HFCs\u2019  growth  and  the  affordability  of  mortgage  loans\u2014particularly  in  their  LCAH \nfinance  business  because  of  the  lower  profit  margins.  The  government  has  recognized  this \nmarket  constraint  and,  given  that  this  is  a  priority  sector,  the  RBI  provided  a  $1  billion  ECB \nquota for LCAH in 2014 and another $1 billion in 2015. International commercial banks are not \nwilling  to  lend  for  longer  tenors  and  the  appetite  for  longer  tenor  bonds  among  private  sector \ninvestors decreases drastically as the tenor of bonds increase. 24 ADB is thus filling this market \ngap.  \n \n26. \nSupporting the housing sector. This project will support housing sector development, \nwhich  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  by  generating  employment, \nimproving  housing,  and  raising  standards  of  living.  Housing  finance  also  helps  develop  the \nfinancial sector by improving its overall depth, diversity, buoyancy, and resilience.  \n\n \nRisks (Deleted) \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nDevelopment  impact.  Developing  the  housing  finance  market  and  increasing  the \nprovision of and private sector investments in  low-cost affordable housing are aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017, which highlights the impact of housing sector \ndevelopment  in  promoting  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  through  employment \ngeneration,  improved  housing,  and  higher  standards  of  living. 25  Housing  is  also  a  strong \ncontributor to GDP growth.26   \n \n28. \nfor low-cost affordable housing in India will be demonstrated to be sustainable. \n\nOutcome. The  expected  outcome  of the  project will  be  that  PNBHF\u2019s  lending  activities \n\n                                                \n22 ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations.

PNBHF can mobilize deposits, but these tend to be short-term.  \n\n24 Data accessed in September 2015 from Prime Database shows that only 35% of the bonds issued with maturities \nbetween  3-7  years  were  from  private  financial  institutions,  while  at  7  years  and  longer,  the  number  of  financial \ninstitutions able to access the capital markets falls to just 10%. \n\n25 Government of India.

The  expected  output  of  the  project  will  be  to  increase  financing  for  LCAHs \nthrough  PNBHF  as  evidenced  by  (i)  PNBHF\u2019s  number  of  low-cost  affordable  housing  loans \nincreasing  from  21,830  in  FY2015  to  30,400  in  FY2022,  (ii)  PNBHF\u2019s  portfolio  of  LCAH  loans \nincreasing from Rs23,241 million to Rs32,733 million by FY2022, and (iii) at least 30.0% of the \nnew low-cost affordable housing allocated to women named on the title as owner or joint owner. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the financial sector \nby  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.  The \nproposed project contributes to financial sector development by supporting the growth of HFCs, \nan  important  component  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector  in India.  Strategy  2020  also  seeks  to \npromote inclusive growth.27 Without access to formal financial services, lower income people or \nunderserved  segments  will  be  excluded  from  the  growth  process  and  its  benefits.  Under  the \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020, cities also constitute a key focus in terms of promoting livable \ncities  that  are  competitive  and  environmentally  attractive.  According  to  the  India  country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017,  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  will  continue  to  support  the \ninfrastructure  and  financial  sectors  by  undertaking  selective  projects  for  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure  and  financial  infrastructure.28 The  proposed  project  will  support  the  development \nof  housing  finance  in  India,  one  of  the  financial  infrastructures  identified  in  the  country \npartnership strategy and a high priority for the government with growing emphasis on including \nprivate sector financing. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  category  FI  (treated  as  C)  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \n31. \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The project is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. PNBHF \nwill not finance real estate development or mass housing construction. It will use ADB\u2019s loan to \nfund mortgage loans to individuals, primarily in urban and semiurban areas. No land acquisition \nor  physical  or  economic  displacements  are  expected  from  the  activities of  the  borrower,  since \nthe  housing  loans  will  be  provided  to  individuals  who  have  purchased  the  property  with  a \nmortgage or are voluntarily making improvements to their dwellings. The project is not expected \nto  have  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  The  investment\u2019s  potential  environment  and  social \nimpacts,  the  risks  associated  with  the  borrower\u2019s  existing  and/or  likely  future  portfolio,  and  its \ncommitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social  management,  have  been  assessed. \nPNBHF will enhance its staff capacity to carry out the assessment and oversight of the progress \nof  the  environmental  (including  climate  change)  and  social  risks  screening  and  monitoring \neffectively.  PNBHF  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list 29  and  ensure  that \ninvestments  using  ADB  funds  comply  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Social Protection Strategy.30 Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n\n                                                \n27 ADB. 2014.
