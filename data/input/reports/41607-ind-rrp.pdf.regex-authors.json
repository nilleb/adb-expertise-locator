The environmental implications were reviewed; no adverse \nAssessment  impact was identified. \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \n \nNo involuntary resettlement or adverse impact on indigenous people is \nexpected from program implementation. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nProgram  The program seeks to help the state government of Mizoram (SGM) to \nDescription  create fiscal space by (i) enhancing tax and nontax revenue measures \nand rationalizing expenditures; (ii) bringing about service improvements \nin two key sectors (health and education) in a cost-effective manner;  \n(iii) ensuring better debt management; (iv) reforming the state pension \nsystem;  and  (v)  restructuring  public  sector  enterprises,  including \nthrough closure, as needed. \n   \nRationale  The rationale for the program is based on two underlying factors: (i) the \npolitical commitment of SGM to bring about necessary fiscal reforms to \nset the fiscal situation on a trajectory that is balanced, sustainable, and \ngeared to meeting the long-term needs of the population of the state; \nand (ii) the need of the state economy for a program that takes a holistic \nview of fiscal reforms ranging from a focus on macro and, for example, \nmedium-term expenditure frameworks to a focus on micro reforms such \nas ensuring that sector reforms contribute to improved service delivery \nand enhanced fiscal space. The program directly addresses key issues \nfacing SGM as it tries to direct the economy on a more sustainable \ndevelopment path. \n   \nImpact and  The  impact  of  the  program  will  be  evident  in  SGM  increasing \nOutcome  investments  of  public  funds  to  improve  inclusive  human  and  social \ndevelopment in the state. The program seeks an outcome of greater \nfiscal  space  in,  and  financial  flexibility  of,  the  government  budget \nresulting from: (i) increased tax and nontax revenues; (ii) rationalized \nexpenditures in areas such as pensions and public sector enterprises, \nand through the adoption of medium-term expenditure frameworks in ", "ii   \nhealth and education; (iii) debt restructuring; and (iv) improved services \nin two key sectors (health and education) in a cost-effective manner. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $94,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided to India under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, \na commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nThe loan will be released in three tranches: (i) $47,000,000 for the first \ntranche, (ii) $40,000,000 for the second tranche, and (iii) $7,000,000 for \nthe third tranche. The first tranche will be released upon fulfillment of all \nagreed conditions for the first tranche and following effectiveness of the \nloan.  The  second  tranche  will  be  disbursed  16  months  after  loan \neffectiveness upon satisfactory fulfillment of the corresponding tranche \nrelease conditions (or earlier than 16 months if the conditions have \nbeen met). The third tranche will be disbursed 14 months after the \nsecond tranche, subject to satisfactory fulfillment of the corresponding \ntranche release conditions (or earlier than 14 months if the conditions \nhave been met).  \n   \nAllocation and  The Government of India (Government) will relend 10% of the loan \nRelending Terms  proceeds  in  local  currency  to  SGM.  The  relending  terms  will  be  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external \nassistance to SGM and it will be treated as additional to Government \ntransfers. The remaining 90% of the loan proceeds will be provided as \ngrants. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The program period will be from August 2009 (or loan effectiveness) to \n  July 2012 (or 36 months after loan effectiveness). \n   \nEstimated Program  July 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  SGM, acting through its Department of Finance (DOF) \n   \nImplementation  A program steering committee will be responsible for overall direction, \nArrangements  guidance, and monitoring; and will provide oversight of the Program. \nThe principal secretary, DOF, SGM, will chair the committee, which will \ninclude the principal secretaries or secretaries of the Department of \nPlanning  and  Program  Implementation  and  each  of  the  program \nimplementing  agencies,  including  their  heads  of  departments.  The \ncommittee will report to the chief minister through the chief secretary. \nThe committee will meet as and when necessary but at least once every \nquarter. \n \nThe  fiscal  management  unit  (FMU)  in  the  DOF  (as  the  program \nmanagement unit) will facilitate the various reforms, and be responsible \nfor  daily  implementation  of  the  program  under  the  guidance  of  the \n ", "  iii \nprogram steering committee. The FMU will coordinate with, and help to \nthe extent necessary, the program implementing units in the various \nimplementing  agencies  that  will  support  attainment  of  program \noutcomes. The program implementing agencies include Directorate of \nAccounts  and Treasuries  at  the  DOF,  and  departments  of  taxation, \npublic health engineering, transport, health and family welfare, school \neducation, and land revenue and settlement. For monitoring purposes, \nthe  program  implementing  units  must  provide  quarterly  reports  on \nprogram implementation. \n   \nProcurement and  The proceeds of the program loan will be used to finance the foreign \nDisbursement  exchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced in, \nand procured from, ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items \nand  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998), the \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Borrower.  \n   \nProgram Benefits   The benefits of the program are expected to be evident in the following: \n(i)  availability  of  more  resources  to  invest  in  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure; (ii) more efficient allocation of budget resources to social \nsectors given the application of medium-term expenditure frameworks; \n(iii) ability of SGM, in the long term, to place its fiscal affairs on a \nsounder  footing  that  can  sustain  investments  for  more  rapid  and \ninclusive growth; and (iv) greater access to, and quality of, services in \nthe education and health sectors to the population of Mizoram.  \n   \nRisks and  Program  success  depends  on  the  continued  strong  commitment  of \nAssumptions  SGM  to  fiscal  reforms  and  to  the  broader  governance  issues  of \ntransparency in fiscal matters. However, the possibility remains that \ncurrent measures and reform efforts, including insufficient capacity in \nspecific implementing government agencies to carry out the reforms, \nmay not be sustained. These risks will be mitigated by (i) continued \npolicy  dialogue  with  SGM  as  well  as  with  the  Government,  and  \n(ii) specific technical assistance (TA) and capacity development support \nfor  the  weak  implementing  agencies.  For  its  part,  SGM  has  fully \ncommitted to this reform agenda, as demonstrated in its ability to meet \nall the first tranche conditions of the program. \n \nThe  key  assumptions  inherent  in  the  program  are  that  (i)  SGM \ncommitment to reforms across the various sectors (including reform of \npublic  sector  enterprises)  will  continue,  (ii)  the  Thirteenth  Finance \nCommission does not alter the existing trend of fiscal devolution to the \nstates, (iii) capacity development plans are in place and are funded and \nused, (iv) SGM is able to implement the voluntary retirement scheme for \nschool teachers in an impartial and transparent manner, (v) the greater \nfiscal space will result in reorientation of expenditure into social and \nA\np\neconomic infrastructure, and (vi) any developments that take place in  p\ne\nthe short to medium term will not adversely affect the program in any  n\nd\nsubstantive manner.   ix 3\n   \niii \n ", "iv   \nThe Technical Assistance (TA) Loan \n \nImpact and  The primary outcome of the TA is  strong SGM institutions that are \nOutcome  responsible for reform programs across various activities so that they \n  can improve fiscal management performance. A key objective of the TA \nis also to support SGM to comply with all policy conditions under the \nprogram loan. \n   \nFinancing Plan   A loan of $6,000,000 from the ADB\u2019s OCR will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nThe Government  will  relend  10%  of  the  loan,  and  provide  90%  as \ngrants,  to  SGM  to  support  (i)  revenue  administration,  (ii)  project \nappraisal and monitoring, (iii) preparation of medium-term expenditure \nframeworks, (iv) treasury automation, and (v) debt management. This is \nexpected to help mitigate the risks associated with insufficient capacity \nin government agencies. The estimated cost of the TA program is $7.68 \nmillion. SGM will provide counterpart funds equivalent to $1.36 million in \nin-kind  support,  and  the  Government  will  finance  interest  and \ncommitment  charges  of  $0.32  million.  Consultants  will  be  recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \nThe TA loan will have terms similar to the program loan but will be \nreleased  to  the  Government,  and  subsequently  SGM,  on  a  direct \npayment and reimbursement basis using the statement of expenditure \nprocedure. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n ", " \n  I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to India for the Mizoram Public Resource Management Program, and (ii) a proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  for  supporting  the  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework for the Program is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \nA.  Recent Economic Performance of India \n \n2.  India\u2019s  economy  has  shown  impressive  growth  in  recent  years  with  strong \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals  and  averaging  close  to  9%  over  the  5-year  period  ending \n2007/08. However, recent turmoil in the global economy has raised concerns about sustaining \nthe impressive growth performance. Overall, growth is now expected to be around 6.7% for \n2008/09.  \n \n3.  With  respect  to  fiscal  management,  the  gross  tax\u2013gross  domestic  product  ratio \nincreased from 9.2% in 2003/04 to 12.6% in 2007/08. The Government of India (Government) \ncontinued with progress in terms of reducing the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, and increasing \noutlays  for  several  social  sector  and  infrastructure  development  programs.  However,  the \nprocess of fiscal consolidation being followed by the Government since 2004/05 has been \ndisrupted by the current financial and economic crisis and related uncertainties. The central \nGovernment has justified temporarily postponing compliance with the targets set under the \nFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in the context of the economic \nslowdown. The central government's fiscal deficit has risen to 6% of gross domestic product \ncompared  with  2.5%  targeted  for  2008/09.  Both  revenue  shortfall  and  higher  expenditure \ncontributed to the rise in the fiscal deficit. In the central budget for 2009/10, the Government has \nestimated a fiscal deficit of 6.8% for 2009/10 although it has also reiterated its commitment to \nreduce the fiscal deficit to a sustainable amount.   \n \nB.  Recent Economic Performance of Mizoram \n \n4.  Regarded  as  a  small  state  (with  a  population  of  approximately  1  million  people), \neconomic trends in Mizoram have not mirrored those of India as a whole. From 1999 to 2008, \nMizoram\u2019s growth rate of 6.2% was below the all-India average of 7.1%. While the gross state \ndomestic product (GSDP) at factor cost in 2005/06 grew by 2.4% over the previous year, this \nincreased to 5.5% in 2007/08 (advance estimates) due to robust performance in key service \nsectors such as finance, insurance, real estate, and business services.1 \n \n5.  The state could experience some external shocks in the months to come, primarily \nbecause of the general slowing of the Indian economy (which could impact intergovernment \nfiscal transfers) and adverse impacts of pay revisions. Preliminary estimates suggest that the \nstate government of Mizoram (SGM) requires an additional Rs3 billion annually to implement \nhigher  salaries  of  government  employees.  This  brings  to  the  forefront  the  importance  of \nrenewed attention to fiscal reform. The quality of public expenditure and usefulness of several \npublic  programs  need  to  be  reviewed,  while  preventing  cutoffs  of  ongoing  infrastructure \nspending. Better targeting of food subsidies and improved tax efforts have become imperative \nfor achieving a sustainable fiscal deficit and public debt. \n                                                \n1  Government of Mizoram. 2008. Economic Survey\u2013Mizoram, 2007\u20132008. Aizawl. Sectors showing low growth rates \nare agriculture; forestry and fisheries; mining and quarrying; and trade, transport, and communication. ", "2     \n2\n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  A\np\np\n  e\nn\n6.  Mizoram has made considerable progress, particularly in social sector development,  d\nix\ne.g., it ranks second only to Kerala in terms of literacy, has exceptionally good performance in  1 \n0\nterms of low infant mortality and death rates, and has seen a decline in the decadal rate of   \npopulation growth. Mizoram also embodies a number of sharp diversities and contradictions. \nWhile half of the population are dependent on agriculture (with shifting cultivation the dominant \nmode of organizing production), the remainder are largely associated with construction activities \nand the services sector, of which government is a predominant component. However, fiscal \ncorrection  initiatives  in  recent  times  have  limited  the  scope  for  employment  expansion  in \ngovernment. The economic performance of Mizoram is constrained mainly by its geography - it \nhas significant hilly terrain that results in high transportation costs and low population density \n(particularly outside of Aizawl, the capital city), both leading to high costs of service delivery. \nAppendix 2 provides a more detailed sector analysis2 and Supplementary Appendixes B\u2013G \nprovide relevant information on various aspects of sectors affected by the program. \n \n1.  Fiscal Performance \n \n7.  If the fiscal health of a government is to be summarized in terms of a single indicator, it \nwould be the gross fiscal deficit, i.e., the requirement of debts to implement spending decisions \nrelated to capital and current expenditures. High ratios portend high debt in the future along with \nincreasing debt service liability that, in turn, limits resources available for development spending \n(Table 1 provides broad fiscal aggregates for the state). \n \n8.  The state has succeeded in substantially increasing its own revenues (both tax and \nnontax) since 2001/02, particularly from 2005/06. It has also managed to contain the growth of \nexpenditures so that the revenue surplus has been sustained since 2003/04.  \n \n9.  In Mizoram, the gross fiscal deficit fluctuated from 21.6% in 2000/01 to 6.4% in 2006/07. \nA redeeming feature is that revenue balances (indicating the state\u2019s ability to finance its current \nexpenditures from its current resources) have come down from a deficit of 11.1% in 2000/01 to \na surplus of 6.5% of GSDP in 2008/09 (revised estimate). However, this achievement appeared \nto  be  inadequate  to  contain  the  fiscal  deficit  at  a  manageable  level  during  2007/08  and \n2008/09. 3 This  brings  to  the  forefront  the  need  for  expenditure  rationalization  through \nprioritization and evaluation of government programs. \n \n2.  Revenues \n \n10.  Central Transfers. Mizoram's public finances are heavily dependent on transfers from \nthe Government. This has two major impacts: (i) the part of available non-debt resources that \ncan be spent in a way decided wholly by the state itself is somewhat circumscribed; these \ncomprise its own tax and nontax revenues, shared taxes, and general purpose grants; and (ii) \nthe fact that plan transfers are available to the state as 90% grant and 10% loan creates a \n                                                \n2  The term \u2015sector\u2016 as used here does not reflect the usual meaning of a sphere of definable economic activity (such \nas transport, power, agriculture) but refers more to the general macroeconomic components and variables of \nrevenue, expenditures, debts, pensions, public sector enterprise activities, etc. This is relevant for a program of this \nnature because it helps give the proper context to the outcome of fiscal space in the state economy.  \n3  The fiscal deficit was 4.8% of GSDP in 2007-08. The difference between this figure and that reported in Table 1 is \nthe result of the Comptroller and Auditor General not acknowledging the receipt of Rs2.3 billion of grants although \nSGM received them. The amount is expected to be brought forward in 2008/09 resulting in a decrease in the fiscal \ndeficit to GSDP ratio to 3.8%.  \n ", "  3 \nsense of complacency regarding debt buildup over a long period of time; this is reflected in the \npersistently high fiscal deficit. Thus, the state has limited flexibility in influencing the composition \nof its own expenditure. \n \nTable 1: Mizoram\u2013Broad Fiscal Aggregates \n(Rs million) \nItem  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08  2008/09 (RE) \nA.

Trends in central transfers clearly show that Mizoram continues to rely substantially on \nthe center for its revenues. Central transfers, as percent of revenue receipts, have consistently \nhovered around 90%\u201392%.  \n \n12.  Own Receipts. During 2001/02 to 2007/08, revenue receipts increased by an average \nof more than 18% per annum. Central transfers (shared taxes and grants), constituting the \nlarger share of total revenue receipts, grew at about the same rate; while the relatively small \ncomponent of own receipts grew at about 23% annually on average. In terms of the 2007/08 \nfigures, the state\u2019s own receipts constituted only a little more than 10% of total revenue receipts. \nAdding the share of central taxes, this percentage rises to about 28% of total revenue. Given \nthat central grants have increasingly been allocated to specific purposes, the untied resources \nof the state are estimated at about 50% at best, with utilization of the other half predetermined. \nThis is an important consideration when assessing the finances of the state. \n \nA\n3.  Expenditures  p\np\ne\n  n\nd\n13.  Overall  Expenditure  Profile.  The  state's  public  expenditure-led  growth  strategy  is  ix\n 3\nmanifested  in  the  high  government  expenditure  in  Mizoram.  As  a  ratio  to  GSDP,  total   \nexpenditure  increased  from  68%  to  almost  80%  from  2001/02  to  2007/08.  Revenue \nexpenditures have been hovering at 57%\u201359% of GSDP in recent years. This is exceptionally  3\n \n ", "4     \n4\n \nhigh by the average standard in India. The main contributor to the increase in total expenditure \nhas been the increase in capital expenditure, especially the increase in capital outlay. Within \nrevenue expenditures, general services show modest average annual growth of about 8%, with  A\np\np\ninterest payments showing an even lower rate (of a little more than 6%). Expenditures on social  e\nn\nservices increased by about 14% and economic services by about 12%. The relative growth  d\nix\nrates  are  significant  because  general  services  have  claimed  a  lower  share  of  revenue  1 \n0\nexpenditures than social services, but higher than economic services. Given that social and   \neconomic  services  broadly  constitute  development  expenditures,  both  components  should \nideally be higher than general services. This is not so at present, but given the trends general \nservices are very likely to become the smallest of the three components in the near future. \nCapital outlays managed an increasing trend from 2004/05 to 2007/08.  \n \n14.  Debt Profile and Debt Servicing. The ratio of public debt to GSDP remained above \n80% during 2002\u20132008 and maintained a rising trend, reaching 94% on 31 March 2007. The \ndebt ratios are clearly substantially above the limit of 28% suggested by the Twelfth Finance \nCommission. However, the interest payment to revenue receipts ratio was below the limit of \n15% suggested by the commission because the effective interest rate during the period was \nless than 8%. The effective interest rate is expected to be around 6% in 2008/09. Thus, if the \nstate could target retirement of remaining high-cost loans, the interest burden could be further \nreduced, and the debt ratios favorably impacted. \n \n15.  Guarantees. As of 31 March 2007 (for the latest data available), SGM had backed loans \ntaken by statutory corporations and other government institutions totaling Rs2.49 billion. Also as \nof that date, the total principal and interest payment outstanding for these loans was close to \nRs1.5 billion. SGM has not specified an indicative limit upto which guarantees can be issued. \nThe DOF continues to examine and issue guarantees on a case-by-case basis. \n \n16.  Pensions. SGM has in place a defined benefit scheme of pensions for its employees. \nThe revisions of pay and pensions by decennial pay commissions and the rapid increase in \nemployment  in  the  state  have  had  an  impact  on  substantially  increasing  SGM\u2019s  pension \nexpenditures. In addition, the current pension policy has a few costly features that increase the \ncost of servicing pensions. Utilizing broad aggregates of retirement expenditures as available \nfrom  the  accountant  general\u2019s  Annual  Finance  and  Accounts,4 expenditures  because  of \nretirement benefits as a percent of GSDP peaked at 3.6% in 2004/05 before decelerating to \n2.9% in 2008/09. The peaks are due to substantial additions to the pension system as a result \nof SGM\u2019s voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for a particular section of transport department \nemployees. \n \n  4.  Social Sectors \n \n17.  Health Sector. Expenditure on health and family welfare as a percent of expenditure on \nall social services declined from 16.4% in 2003/04 to 11.8% in 2006/07. During the same period, \nthe ratio of total health expenditure to the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic \nservices declined from 0.05% to 0.04%. This trend of declining spending on health could be a \ncause for concern. One such area of spending is the Mizoram Health Insurance Scheme that \nwas in operation during 2008/09. Under this scheme, a patient received treatment either in a \ngovernment hospital or facility, or a private empanelled hospital. The Department of Health and \nFamily Welfare decided on the rates for various treatments in consultation with private hospitals. \nThese rates were common to both private and government facilities and the insurance provider \nmade payments on the basis of these rates. This scheme was supposed to generate additional \n                                                \n4  Currently, no database accurately provides information on the total number of pensioners in the pension system \nand the number of pensioners transiting into, or exiting from, the system. \n ", "  5 \nrevenue for government hospitals as the rates that were charged were much higher than those \ncharged  before.  SGM  is  now  changing  the  implementation  arrangements  for  the  original \nscheme to make it self-financing.5 If the proposed scheme is successful, government hospitals \nwill be able to set the user charges appropriately and finance a larger percentage of their \nexpenditures from their own revenues. In due course, SGM could reduce funding support to \nthese hospitals and thus reduce the burden on its finances.  \n \n18.  Education  Sector.  Expenditure  on  all  levels  of  education  (elementary,  secondary, \nhigher and technical, adult education, and language development) has been around 40% of \nexpenditures on all social services in the past few years. The ratio of total education expenditure \nto the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic services (within the capital and \nrevenue heads) has been more or less stable at 0.14%. Within education expenditure, from \n2003/04 to 2006/07, the share of elementary education was stable at around 48%, while that of \nsecondary education fluctuated in the range of 20%\u201322%. The greater emphasis on elementary \neducation is a result of the Government\u2019s flagship program for elementary education, i.e., the \nSarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  (or  \"education for  all campaign\").  A  similar  program  is  now  being \nlaunched to extend the gains seen in enrolment and retention to secondary education (called \nSUCCESS). The high dropout rates for secondary education underline the need for increasing \nexpenditure in an effective manner with improved targeting.  \n \n  5.  Fiscal Impact of Public Sector Enterprises \n \n19.  The performance of state public sector enterprises (PSEs) has also affected the state \nbudget. Currently, all of the five small PSEs in Mizoram are loss-making.6 In addition, there are \ntwo  departmental  undertakings:  Mizoram  State  Transport,  and  Power  and  Electricity \nDepartment. As of 31 March 2007, the total investment in PSEs was Rs892 million (equity of \nRs463 million, long-term loans of Rs335 million, and share application money of Rs94 million). \nThe PSEs are in financial distress requiring huge amounts of budgetary support to sustain them. \n \n20.  Budgetary outlays on PSEs are summarized in Table 2. In spite of a periodic infusion of \nequity capital and grants, the companies continue to report losses. The liability of SGM on these \nenterprises is also on account of the guarantees provided on borrowings by them. Accumulated \nlosses of the two departmental undertakings as of 31 March 2008 were Rs737 million.  \n \nTable 2: Budgetary Outlays on Public Sector Enterprises \n(Rs million) \nItem  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07 \nEquity Capital  16.7  61.6  21.0 \nGrants and Subsidies  11.2  11.2  22.2 \nTotal  27.9  72.8  43.2 \nNote: The budgetary outlays refer to support provided in the form of equity, loans, grants, and \nsubsidy from the state government. \nSource: Government of Mizoram, Comptroller and Accountant General Report (various issues). \n \n \n     \n                                                 A\np\n5  Under the proposed scheme, Mizoram Health Care Society will bypass an insurance provider and manage the  p\ne\nscheme with the help of a third party administrator. The proposed scheme has many advantages including lower  n\nd\ncost of operations and efficient claims processing.   ix\n6  These are (i) Zoram Industrial Development Corporation Limited (Zidco), (ii) Zoram Electronics Development    3\nCorporation Limited (Zenics), (iii) Mizoram Food & Allied Industries Corporation Limited (Mifco), (iv) Mizoram \nAgriculture Marketing Corporation Limited (Mamco), and (v) Mizoram Handloom and Handicraft Development \nCorporation Limited (Zohanco).  5\n \n ", "6     \n6\n \n6.  Fiscal Discipline through FRBM Legislation \n \n21.  SGM enacted the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in 2006  A\np\np\n(and its relevant rules in 2007); the objectives included eliminating the revenue deficit and  e\nn\nreducing the fiscal deficit to 3% of GSDP by 2008/09. Consequently, SGM has taken the  d\nix\nfollowing steps to implement fiscal reforms: (i) set up a public expenditure review committee; (ii)  1 \n0\nconducted the finance minister\u2019s half-yearly review; (iii) prepared the medium-term fiscal policy   \nstatement, the fiscal policy strategy statement, and the macroeconomic framework statement; \n(iv) established the Debt Consolidation and Relief Facility, and the Consolidated Sinking Fund; \n(v) made arrangements for management of public debt, and (vi) initiated reforms in the areas of \ntax, expenditure, and service delivery. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n22.  Effective  management  of  public  resources  in  Mizoram  involves  addressing  several \nchallenges,  including:  (i)  low  revenue  and  high  expenditures,  (ii)  debt  overhang  and \nmanagement, (iii) continued reliance on Government transfers, and (iv) sector-specific issues in \nthe health and education sectors. Superseding these is the inherent geographic constraints \nfaced by the state. Given the difficulties due to terrain, service delivery costs are high, if indeed \nthey  are  provided  at  all  in  remote  areas.7 This  is  a  binding  constraint  in  this  program \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n1.  Issues \n \n23.  Low Own-Source Revenue and High Expenditures. A primary issue dominating state \nfinances for some time is the growing gap between own-source revenues and expenditures.8 \nWhile heavy reliance needs to be placed on central transfers (Table 1), the inability of the state \nto raise substantially its own-source revenues is worrisome. Tax and nontax sources of revenue \nin the state are fragmented, and resource constraints continue to be a key feature of the state \neconomy.  Mizoram  has  a  limited  resource  base  with  committed  expenditures  that  include \nincreasing salaries and wages, pensions, and interest payments. The state is  also having \ndifficulty meeting the demands for funds from government agencies, particularly for service \nsector departments like health and education where the salary component of the plan allocation \nis  very  high.9 Finally,  the  narrow  base  of the state  economy  means that  despite  revenue \nenhancement measures (such as introduction of value-added tax on several new items and \nincreased tax rates on some others), the only viable option for balancing the state budget is to \nrationalize expenditure growth. \n \n24.  On the other hand, sources of expenditures have risen substantially over the years.10 \nThis is evident in the following line items, for example:  \n \n                                                \n7  An issue that SGM currently faces, as a once in half century occurrence, is a phenomenon known as bamboo \nflowering. From past experience, this phenomenon is followed by severe  famine (called mautam) due to a \nproliferation of rats the previous year given the availability of ample food as a result of the seeding of the bamboos.  \n8  Own-source revenue remains at 6%\u20137% of total expenditure. \n9  For example, salary constituted 79% of total expenditure on education in 2007/08 (up from 75% a year prior). \nSalary components of other development departments have already increased sharply because of implementation \nof the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. This will increase once SGM implements recommendations \nof  the  Sixth  Pay  Commission.  SGM  will  need  to  consider,  in  parallel,  implementation  of  other  efficiency-\nenhancement recommendations of the Commission. \n10  This issue will continue to vex SGM as long as the development paradigm of public expenditure-led growth is \nfollowed. With few vibrant and efficient private sector firms to play a meaningful role in development, SGM relies on \nthe public sector to deliver services; these are normally not at least cost, however. The state continues to look to \nthe Government to build the capacity of the state government to deliver on economic promises. \n ", "  7 \n(i)  Pensions. On average, the total retirement expenditure for SGM for 2002-2007 \nwas about 4% of total expenditure and 5% of total revenue expenditure of the \nstate.  Moreover,  pension  expenditure  was  always  larger  than  the  own-tax \nrevenues of the state during 2002-2007. The state budget will be faced with \nunmanageable and unfunded pension liabilities if no systemic change is made in \nretirement benefit costs for new government employees. This will undermine the \nsustainability of state finances in the long term. \n(ii)  Lack of proper long-term expenditure planning. This is a particularly vexing \nissue given that SGM has no medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs). \nWithout such tools, resource allocations for the long term to attain government \noutcomes will not be properly aligned to actual resource requirements, or to \nSGM\u2019s stated preferences. \n \n25.  Debt Overhang and Management. Two substantive issues relate to the size of the debt \noverhang for SGM: \n \n(i)  The amount of debt that the state has incurred, and on which it has to pay \ninterest, has become unsustainable. The state asked for assistance from the \nGovernment, which reduced the threshold of what can be considered high-cost \ndebt (debt with interest rates of 9% or higher), and permitted SGM to prematurely \nretire the high-cost debt using program funds that it receives. Currently, SGM has \nRs2.82 billion (excluding Government loans) of high-cost debt.  \n(ii)  Within SGM, the responsibility of government borrowing, debt recording, debt \nservicing,  accounting  for  debt  transactions,  and  overall  debt  management, \nincluding  government  onlending  and  guarantees,  is  scattered  across  several \ngovernment agencies. This makes timely and systematic analysis of government \ndebt and associated risks difficult. The DOF does not have adequate skills for \nefficient debt management. This becomes critical for an efficient public financial \nmanagement system, a key ingredient for sustained fiscal consolidation. Thus, \nbuilding capacity for debt management must be a high priority for SGM. \n \n26.  Reliance on the Center. SGM has always relied extensively on the central Government \nto fund social, economic, and physical infrastructure in the state (for a long time, $9 of every $10 \nof revenue receipts of the state have come from the Government). This is set to continue, \nparticularly given the likely costs of dealing with the adverse economic effects resulting from the \nflowering of the bamboo (footnote 7), and the need for SGM to put in place the economic and \nsocial bases for stronger growth.  \n \n27.  Sector-Specific Issues. A key issue in public resource management has to do with \nsector reforms, particularly in the social sectors, which tend to present the largest burden on the \nbudget. Good practice in public resource management programming indicates that it pays to \nconcentrate on improving services in key sectors of the state economy. This is done for two \nprimary reasons: (i) efficient and effective service delivery in the long run is cost-effective and \nminimizes the burden on the state treasury; and (ii) improved service delivery to the population \nhas a virtuous effect where greater access to, and usage of, services not only meets the needs \nof the population but also engenders greater public trust in government. In the program, service \nimprovements in two key sectors in Mizoram are targeted (i.e., health and education) for which \nA\np\nSGM allocates almost 40% of its budget. Thus, any improvements in these sectors will have  p\ne\ngreat potential for a positive impact on the state budget and economy.   n\nd\n  ix 3\n   \n7\n \n ", "8     \n8\n \n(i)  Health sector. The primary issue in this sector is how to rationalize expenditures \nwhile  at  the  same  time  effectively  provide  the  necessary  level  and  type  of \nservices such that SGM's commitment to \"health for all\" outcomes is suitably  A\np\naddressed.11 In particular, given that SGM wishes to ensure the sustainability of  pe\nn\nthe Mizoram Health Care Scheme (MHC Scheme), the issue is how to pay for  d\nix\nthe scheme on a continuing basis without burdening the budget, while at the  1 \n0\nsame time making service improvements to ensure that the high level of basic   \nhealth care in the state remains accessible to the people. \n(ii)  Education sector. The primary issue in this sector is how to improve the quality \nof education in schools so that the state can sustain the high level of basic \neducation that it has already achieved. One of the measures SGM employs to \nmeasure  the  quality  of  education  is  the  number  of  students  that  pass  their \nexaminations with scores above a specified threshold (the effective participation \nrate  [EPR]).12 Education  sector  outcomes  include  the  provision  of  quality \neducation at schools through skilled teachers such that problems of a low EPR \ncan be better addressed. Both these areas (i.e., low skills of teachers13 and low \nEPR in schools) are areas of concern for SGM. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n28.  Despite  the  pressing  issues  facing  the  economy,  the  opportunities  for  sustained \neconomic growth for Mizoram in the long term are immense. Opportunities for the state to \nsubstantially reform its economy are evident along numerous fronts. \n \n29.  High Basic Literacy Rates. Mizoram ranks only behind Kerala in basic literacy rates; \nthis means that if suitable employment opportunities can be presented, the state could readily \nhave a skilled workforce without incurring high costs. The high level of basic education also \nimplies that the application of information technology is more possible in educational institutions.  \n \n30.  Very Strong Political Commitment. SGM has been uniquely at the forefront of the \neconomic  reform  agenda,  demonstrating  significant  political  commitment  to  bring  about \neconomic reforms.14 A large part of this has to do with the social agenda that successive \ngovernments have pursued.15 This political commitment is evident, for example, in the state\u2019s \ndecision to aggressively pursue core macroeconomic reforms, including putting in place a VRS \nfor underqualified teachers, and substantially reforming the PSEs. \n                                                \n11  In stakeholder consultations carried out in 2006 as part of the work to prepare the E-Governance Road Map, \nPricewaterhouseCoopers reported that the respondents identified quality, modern, accessible, and affordable \nhealth care for all as a primary need. The consultations also showed that they want \"contemporary and skill-centric \n(education) with strong linkages to changing demands of the regional and global economies.\" \n12  The EPR is a common tool used to measure the quality of the education system by measuring the percentage of \nstudents passing their examination with 60% marks or above. Statistics for 2006/07 indicate that in Mizoram the \noverall pass rate for primary schools was 93.39%, but the EPR was only 21.69%; for middle school, the overall \npass rate was 91.60%, with an EPR of only 13.19%. Source: Department of School Education. \n13  Currently, at primary schools, where the minimum qualification for teachers is a secondary school certificate, a full \n69.2% of teachers do not have the minimum qualification. At middle schools, where the minimum qualification for \nteachers is college graduation, 45.5% of teachers do not have the minimum qualification. This clearly portends a \nlower quality of instruction in the school system in Mizoram. \n14  For example, the former chief minister presented a reform-minded budget speech to the State Assembly in mid-\nMarch 2008, making various references to the proposed program in support of reform initiatives. In December 2008, \nstate elections brought the Congress Party to power; it has reaffirmed its commitment to reforms along the lines \nsought in the program. \n15  The Mizo National Front, which until December 2008 had formed the government in Mizoram, had won successive \nelections in the state, and always aggressively pursued a proactive social and economic strategy for economic \ndevelopment. The current government is equally committed to pursue targeted reforms to ensure pro-poor growth \nin the state. \n ", "  9 \n \n31.  Strong Central Support. The national Government has always been very supportive of \nstate efforts to bring about economic development. This has manifested in two key ways: \n \n(i)  The  Government  has  allowed  SGM  to  recalibrate  the  composition  of  what \nconstitutes high-cost debts and has given guidance on their premature retirement \n(the threshold of high-cost debt has been lowered to 9% for Mizoram whereas it \ncontinues to stand at 10% for other states). \n(ii)  The Government has also given positive consideration to state-specific issues \nrelated to trade and sector growth.16 \n \n32.  Introduction  of  Merit in  the  School  System.  The state education system has an \nopportunity to replace underqualified teachers in primary and secondary schools with qualified \nteachers,  using  demonstrable  merit  criteria.  This  presents  an  opportunity  to  substantially \nimprove services in the sector, and in the long-term have a positive impact on the quality of the \nskilled labor force entering the workforce. \n \n33.  Bases  for  Economic  Growth.  Mizoram  is  considered  to  have  a  good  investment \nenvironment, widespread primary education, and a stable law and order situation. These are \npowerful opportunities that the state can exploit to entice investment. This also presents an \nopportunity to take a fundamental look at the performance of the PSEs and recommend how the \nfive loss-making PSEs can be restructured or closed. The state has incurred huge contingent \nliabilities on these PSEs (both in terms of unpaid repayments and unpaid interest liabilities), and \nis politically committed to fundamentally change the situation.  \n \n3.  Government of Mizoram Strategy \n \n34.  SGM is keen to ensure that rapid economic growth in the state leads to a reduction in \nincome-based, as well as human and social-based, poverty. It recognizes that ensuring rapid \ngrowth is a function of several variables, not the least of which is a strong state fiscal position \n(Appendix 3 provides SGM's reform agenda in this sector, and the policy matrix highlighting \nspecific reforms SGM has committed to undertake during the program period). Its strategy to \ncreate this position is centered on (i) enhancing revenue measures that are own-source based; \n(ii)  limiting  unproductive  expenditures  in  relevant  sectors;  (iii)  ensuring  proper  economic \nmanagement, such as of debts; (iv) reorienting PSEs so that they are not a financial drain on \nthe state treasury; and (v) building capacity of relevant parts of the state government so that \neconomic management is more efficient and effective.   \n \n4.  ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n35.  Since 2003, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for India and its relevant updates and \ncountry operations business plans have focused largely on poverty reduction as the overarching \ngoal of its support to the country.17 The most important challenge facing the achievement of high \ngrowth is that of a major fiscal turnaround. ADB has so far provided assistance for fiscal \nconsolidation in India to the following states: Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. \n \nA\np\np\ne\n                                                 n\nd\n16 This includes (i) extending financial and technical support to assist the state in exporting its unique agricultural  ix\nproduce, such as anthurium flowers, mandarin oranges, and passion fruit;  and (ii) liberalizing the airfreight    3\nassistance scheme for perishable product exports. \n17 ADB. 2003.

ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India for 2009, which is closely aligned with   \nthe priorities of the 11th Five Year Plan of India (from 2007/08 to 2011/12) will support the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to promote broad-based and inclusive growth, catalyze investment, and  A\np\np\nimprove the effectiveness of development interventions (including through greater reliance on  e\nn\npublic\u2013private  partnerships).  The  Government\u2019s  focus  will  continue  to  be  on  infrastructure  d\nix\ninvestment, social development, and agriculture and rural development to make the growth  1 \n0\nprocess  more  inclusive.  It  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  generate  productive  employment   \nopportunities, improve public service delivery, and balance the environment\u2013growth trade-off. \nFocus on public resource management and governance remains one of the key areas of ADB \nstrategy to support the Government.18 Finally, ADB\u2019s India country operations business plan \ntargets poor states to address inclusive growth.  \n \n5.  Lessons  \n \n37.  Given that ADB has designed similar assistance programs in some states of India and in \nother countries of the region (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), the program draws on \nmany valuable lessons. Program design also reflects lessons from the recommendations of the \nADB Independent Evaluation Department in various special evaluation studies as well as recent \nassessments of ADB\u2019s public resource management reform programs.19 Lessons include: \n \n(i)  effective and viable political economy analysis is required to improve reform \ndesign and risk-mitigation measures; \n(ii)  development  of  policy  programs  on  public  resource  management  requires \nfocusing  on  supporting  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  legislation,  using  MTEFs, \nstrengthening  systems  through  automation,  and  avoiding  special-purpose \nprogram implementation arrangements; \n(iii)  reform options have to be based on feasible governance risk assessments; and \n(iv)  sufficient provision of TA support has to be made to implement the program. \n \n38.  The program also places emphasis on proper sequencing of reforms, and complements \nthat with a focus on the application of design tools\u2014such as the policy matrix, and the design \nand monitoring framework\u2014to achieve development results. It pays attention to specifying a \nrealistic development outcome and outputs, and ensuring better monitoring and evaluation. \nFinally, the TA components of the program are designed to help government officials be better \nequipped  with  needed competencies  as  well  as  provide  technical knowledge  upgrading  in \nspecific fiscal management issues. \n \n6.  External Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n39.  While external involvement in fiscal management reforms in the state of Mizoram has \nbeen minimal, development partners are active in India in the area of fiscal governance reforms. \nBroad areas of support include (i) assistance to make delivery institutions more accountable; (ii) \npublic  financial  management,  including  budget  reforms  in  state  finance  departments;  (iii) \nintroduction of medium-term fiscal framework in state governments; (iv) support for outcome-\nbased budgeting; (v) tax administration reforms; (vi) computerization of treasuries and other \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2005.

The rationale for the program is based on three underlying factors of why a program of \nthis nature is relevant and important for a state such as Mizoram. \n \n(i)  First, it builds on the political commitment of SGM to bring about necessary fiscal \nreforms in the state so that it can set the fiscal situation on a trajectory that is \nbalanced,  sustainable,  and  geared  to  meeting  the  long-term  needs  of  its \npopulation. \n(ii)  Second, the economy currently requires a program that takes a holistic view of \nfiscal reforms ranging from a focus on the macro (for example, MTEFs) to a \nfocus on more micro reforms (such as ensuring that sector reforms contribute to \nimproved service delivery and enhanced fiscal space). \n(iii)  Third, the desire of SGM to address the nonfiscal constraints currently evident in \nthe core social services (i.e., education and health) is strong. The merit criterion \nis currently being undermined in the education sector through the continued \nengagement of underqualified teachers. This needs to change if Mizoram is to \nmake gains in education. SGM is keen to ensure that its population has easy \naccess to basic health care services, and recognizes that accessibility of such \nservices will ensure that the population can participate fully in development. \n \n42.  The program thus directly addresses key issues facing SGM as it tries to move the \neconomy to a more sustainable path of reforms. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n43.  The broad fiscal reforms envisaged in this program are designed to put state finances on \na positive path of increased revenue, rationalized expenditure, debt restructuring leading to \noptimal debt servicing costs, improved services in two key sectors that will have a positive long-\nterm impact on state finances, and limited fiscal drain on state finances of PSEs and pensions. \nThe program comprises a program loan and a TA loan. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n44.  The impact of the program will be evident in SGM increasing investments of public funds \nfor improved social and gender-inclusive human development in the state. This will be a result \nof improved financial flexibility of the state due to better fiscal management and improved \naccess to, and quality of, services in the key sectors of health and education in a cost-effective \nA\np\nmanner. This is expected to contribute to economic growth through greater investments in social  p\ne\nand economic infrastructure leading to employment opportunities and ultimately better living  n\nd\nstandards for the people of the state. The program is aligned with SGM's own stated outcomes  ix 3\non good fiscal management in its FRBM Act.   \n   \n1\n1\n   ", "12    \n1\n2\n45.  The program's outcome is the creation of greater fiscal space in, and financial flexibility   \nof, the state government budget. This greater fiscal space will be a result of (i) increased tax \nand nontax revenues; (ii) rationalized expenditures by adopting MTEFs and initiating reforms in  A\np\np\nareas such as pensions and PSEs; (iii) debt restructuring; and (iv) improved services in two key  e\nn\nsectors (health and education) in a social, gender-inclusive, and cost-effective manner.  d\nix\n  1 \n0\nB.  Policy Framework and Actions    \n \n46.  To achieve this outcome, SGM exhibits significant political commitment to undertake \nfiscal reforms, including carrying out hard decisions on social policies that relate to the health \nand education sectors, and to PSE reform. The program will support SGM to achieve relevant \nresults  including  the  following  major  outputs:20 (i)  successful  implementation  of  revenue \n(including tax and nontax) reforms; (ii) effective restructuring and management of government \ndebts; (iii) rationalization of government expenditures, including through MTEFs; (iv) increased \naccessibility to, and improvements in, services in the health and education sectors; (v) reform of \nthe government pension scheme; and (vi) restructuring and/or closure of loss-making PSEs. \n \n  1.  Tax and Nontax Revenue Reforms \n \n47.  Fiscal consolidation requires that state finances be augmented to the extent possible by \nown-source revenues derived from tax and nontax revenue sources. Reforming the revenue \nstreams is critical to augmenting own-source revenues. The Program primarily focuses on \nimproving revenue administration. Similar initiatives elsewhere suggest that strengthening tax \nadministration leads to higher revenue collection through (i) reduced administrative costs of \ncollecting taxes (e.g., collection costs for sales tax in Mizoram was 7.02% of revenue in 2006/07 \ncompared with the all-India average of 0.91%); (ii) reduced compliance costs for taxpayers; and \n(iii) improved voluntary compliance.21 Accordingly, the program will help SGM to: \n \n(i)  finalize and implement a road map for restructuring the various tax departments \nto facilitate implementation of a series of key tax reforms, including relevant \ncapacity development plans;22 \n(ii)  prepare an audit manual to introduce risk-based audits;23 \n                                                \n20  Appendix 1, the design and monitoring framework, provides a description of the program outputs and performance \ntargets. Tangible products from the program include capacity development plans for restructured tax organizations \nand others, audit manual for risk-based audits, debt management database and manual, guarantee redemption \nfund, long-term sector strategies and MTEFs for health and education sectors, project appraisal and performance \nevaluation system, a health care scheme corpus and an investment plan for it, education information system, \ndefined contributory pension scheme, and a detailed plan for PSE reforms. \n21 For example, empirical estimates suggest that Indonesia's tax administration reforms since 2002 had a strong \npositive impact on the tax yield. Non-oil and gas revenue to gross domestic product ratio increased from 9.9% in \n2002 to 11.6% in 2005 without many changes in tax policies. The result was particularly striking in the case of \nvalue-added tax. Some of the important reforms include (i) setting up a unit for large taxpayers, (ii) improving tax \naudit, and (iii) improving human resource management. (Source: Brondolo, J. et al. 2008. Tax Administration \nReform and Fiscal Adjustment: The Case of Indonesia. IMF Working Paper No. WP-08-129. Washington, DC).  \n22  These reforms include (i) increasing the availability of stamps required for registration of financial transactions;  \n(ii) rationalizing certain rates for entertainment tax to ensure better compliance as well as increasing the rates of \nprofessional tax within allowable ceilings as per the Constitution of India; (iii) aligning the classification of vehicles \nfor applicability of road tax as per the standard terminology used in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Central \nMotor Vehicle Rules, 1989; (iv) introducing a lump sum payment of road tax for a given period in place of annual \npayments; and (v) upward revision of the tax rates on land, buildings, houses, shops, and stalls. In addition, \nMizoram has to implement comprehensive GST reform by April 2010. The Government is spearheading this \nreform, announcing it in last year's federal budget. It has been repeatedly discussed with the Department of \nTaxation (SGM) that relevant organizational restructuring should be done keeping in view this development. \n23  Accordingly, SGM will complete scrutiny of at least the top three most serious cases identified by the risk-based \naudit for the relevant assessment year. This will ensure not only that the right message goes out about SGM's \nseriousness in containing risks, but also that relevant opportunities for augmenting state finances are enhanced. \n ", "  13 \n(iii)  prepare and help implement a plan for collection of tax arrears; \n(iv)  develop the methodology and pilot the objective valuation method for properties \nin at least one district of the state; \n(v)  finalize  a  quality-  and  cost-based  methodology  to  revise  water  charges \nperiodically, and revise the charges accordingly; \n(vi)  complete computerization of land revenue offices; \n(vii)  finalize a road map for land records digitization; and \n(viii)  prepare efficient implementation of goods and services tax. \n \n  2.  Debt Management \n \n48.  To suitably address the debt management issues in the state (para. 25), SGM\u2014in \nconsultation with and concurrence of the Government\u2014has decided to prematurely retire its \nhigh-cost debts (amounting to Rs2.82 billion). While this will considerably free up fiscal space \nfor SGM, it alone will not enable the state government to better manage its debt. What is also \nrequired is a strong and sustainable system of such debt management. This is critical in an \nefficient public financial management system, which is a key ingredient for sustained fiscal \nconsolidation. It is thus a high priority area for SGM to consider building capacity for debt \nmanagement. Debt management initiatives will comprise: \n \n(i)  premature retirement of high-cost debt;24 \n(ii)  implementation of an up-to-date management information system for SGM loans \n(including  guarantees)  with  the  help  of  the  Commonwealth  Secretariat  Debt \nRecording Management System;25 \n(iii)  finalization  of  a  debt  management  manual  that  includes  provisions  for  an \ninstitutional  arrangement  for  improved  management  of  debt  stock  and  new \nborrowings; \n(iv)  placement of a cap on SGM new guarantees to minimize exposure to contingent \nliabilities;26 and \n(v)  setting  up,  and  regular  augmentation,  of  the  Guarantee  Redemption  Fund \nincorporating the provision for guarantee fees as well as a medium-term plan for \nfund augmentation from its own resources. \n \n3.  Public Expenditure Management \n \n49.  Strong public expenditure management is facilitated by well-designed rolling MTEFs for \nefficient  expenditure  targeting  and  management.  The  proposal  for  public  expenditure \nmanagement also essentially aims to improve allocation of scarce public resources across \ngovernment  projects  based  on  project  appraisal  and  evaluation.  Selection  of  new  projects \nshould be based on detailed project appraisal, and allocation of funds across the ongoing \nprojects should depend on their performance in terms of delivering the desired outputs within a \nreasonable time. Finally, treasury computerization will enable SGM to better manage public \nexpenditures. Initiatives under this program component include: (i) establishing and building \ncapacity of the finance commission and project monitoring cell in the DOF to help streamline \npublic expenditures; (ii) piloting treasury computerization in South Aizawl (the largest treasury in \n                                                \n24  These are debts of SGM that carry an interest rate of 9% or more per annum. At present, these debts amount to  A\np\nRs2.82 billion. SGM owes this amount to Reserve Bank of India for market loans and Rural Electricity Corporation;  p\ne\nit owes the market loans to financial institutions, mostly banks. Since the total support for debt restructuring is  n\nd\ngreater than the loan component (10% of $94 million), SGM will use the grant component to prepay debt.  ix\n25  This will include: (i) a debt database with all relevant information (cost of funds, maturity profile), which is readily    3\naccessible by the Department of Finance and others, as necessary; and (ii) an operations plan (including staffing \nrequirements, training) for proper management of the database. \n26 This will include finalizing a risk assessment of all past guarantees provided by SGM.  1\n3\n   ", "14    \n1\n4\nthe state) and, based upon the lessons of this, computerizing the remaining eight treasuries by   \nthe end of the program period; (iii) preparing long-term sector strategies for the health and \neducation sectors, along with a road map for achievement of goals; (iv) instituting a system of  A\np\np\nproject appraisal reports for all new projects and project performance evaluation for existing  e\nn\nones, and institutionalizing a system linking them with fund allocation; and (v) preparing rolling  d\nix\nMTEFs for the health and education departments, to use as the basis for the allocation of  1 \n0\nannual department budgets.   \n \n4.  Service Improvements in the Health and Education Sectors \n \n50.  In the health sector, particular assistance is programmed for developing the Mizoram \nHealth Care Scheme (MHC Scheme) on a sustainable basis to minimize the expenditure burden \non SGM. SGM paid Rs289 million as gross premium for the first year of coverage (from 9 April \n2008 to 8 April 2009). However, detailed analysis shows that the MHC Scheme could be \nmanaged more efficiently at a lower annual cost if the Mizoram Health Care Society took over \nits implementation with the help of a third party administrator.27 The MHC Scheme was reviewed \nagainst other state insurance schemes and the conclusion reached was that a corpus would \nensure  payment  of  future  premiums  for  the  Scheme  without  burdening  the  state.  Specific \nactivities included in the program are: (i) detailed design of the revised MHC Scheme; (ii) \nestablishment  of  a  corpus  to  fund  future  health  care  payments,  and  preparation  of  an \ninvestment plan such that corpus resources are invested judiciously; (iii) capacity building plans \nfor the Mizoram Health Care Society so that it can better manage the MHC Scheme; and (iv) \nannual departmental administrative reports that provide information on the Department of Health \nand Family Welfare as well as any parastatal organization linked to it. Appendix 5 provides \nspecific assumptions on the operations of the corpus, and the conclusion that the state will be \nrequired to augment the corpus to make the MHC Scheme sustainable in the near future. \n \n51.  In the education sector, the program will support SGM\u2019s initiative to improve the quality \nof education in schools by replacing underqualified teachers with qualified ones.28 Funds will be \nprovided under the program to be utilized to make VRS payments to underqualified teachers.29 \nThe assistance is expected to help SGM improve the percentage of students passing primary or \nmiddle school examinations with 60% or more marks. Complementary to the assistance for the \nVRS, the program will focus on strengthening vocational training such that skilled individuals will \nbe  better  able to  access  employment  opportunities.  Specific reform areas  in  this  program \nsubcomponent  include  (i)  finalization  of  a  well-prepared  VRS  for  teachers  in  the  state;  \n(ii) finalization and implementation of a recruitment plan to bring in new qualified teachers to \nreplace those who will accept the VRS; (iii) determination of demand\u2014both from prospective \nstudents  and  potential employers\u2014and revision  of  the  curriculum for  vocational  education;  \n(iv) design of an education information system and distance learning system for teacher training \non a regular basis; and (v) annual department administrative reports that provide information on \nthe Department of School Education as well as any parastatals linked to it. \n \n                                                \n27  SGM has already selected the third party administrator based on transparent technical and cost criteria. \n28  The state has approximately 888 teachers that are considered to be underqualified for the teaching they are \ncurrently  involved  in.  SGM  now  states  its  position  to  \"weed  out  teachers  who  have  very  low educational \nqualifications when compared with the curriculum context of the present day text-books\u2026\" (resolution of the \nExecutive Committee of the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan [\"education for all\"] Mission in March 2007). Given this, SGM is \nconsidering a voluntary retirement scheme for teachers. \n29  In preparing the VRS package, discussions with the relevant unions have been undertaken to ensure that their \nviews are taken into account and that this package meets with their approval. This engagement will continue even \nduring VRS implementation. There is keen eagerness among unionized teachers (both in the primary and middle \nschools) for the VRS. Also, the existing labor pool for teachers in the state is deep enough that an adequate \nnumber of qualified individuals is available to replace teachers that accept the VRS (Supplementary Appendix F). \n ", "  15 \n  5.  Pension Reforms \n \n52.  SGM currently has a defined benefits scheme in place that places considerable pressure \non the state treasury. The program proposes the adoption of the defined contribution system of \npensions for new government employees joining on or after a cutoff date. However, in the short \nterm, the defined contributory pension system puts additional pressure on state finances as \nSGM must pay the pension liabilities of its employees under the old defined benefit system as \nwell as make contributions under the defined contribution system for new employees. The \nprogram thus focuses on a modality of putting employees\u2019 deduction and SGM\u2019s contribution \nsystem in place, as well as initiating the agreement between the pension fund manager and \nSGM. It also envisages providing financial support to meet SGM\u2019s contributions for the defined \ncontributory  pension  scheme  for  new  employees  (such  a  scheme  for  central  Government \nemployees has been in place since 1 April 2004; many states have also implemented the new \npension scheme). \n \n  6.  Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Reforms \n \n53.  The state\u2019s PSEs have historically been a fiscal drag on public finances. The five loss-\nmaking  PSEs  all  urgently  need  comprehensive  reforms,  including  downsizing  or  closure. \nMoreover, the PSEs have not been keeping up-to-date audited accounts. Given this situation, \nthe program supports SGM efforts to initiate an effective PSE reform program including closure \nor privatization where desirable. The program targets: (i) an options analysis on restructuring \nand/or consolidating the PSEs, including privatization or closure (as well as labor rehabilitation \nplans, as needed); (ii) specific public awareness campaigns that are a part of the PSE reform \nexercise; and (iii) notification of closure of all PSEs that are recommended for closure.30 \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n54.  The  following  features  of  the  program  are  noteworthy:  (i)  it  builds  on  the  political \ncommitment of SGM to bring about necessary fiscal reforms in the state; (ii) it takes a holistic \nview of fiscal reforms ranging from a focus on the macro to more micro reforms such as \nensuring that sector reforms contribute to improved service delivery and enhance fiscal space; \n(iii) its design draws on the experiences of similar programs not only within the states of India \n(Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh) but also other countries in the region (such as \nPakistan and Sri Lanka); and finally (iv) the program directly addresses key issues facing SGM \nas it tries to direct the economy to a more sustainable path of reforms. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n55.  Policy reform adjustment costs for the program are based on medium-term adjustment \nscenarios and are assumed to amount to $126.96 million. ADB support will cover approximately \n74% of these costs, and SGM will finance the remaining 26%. Appendix 5 provides the program \nadjustment costs.  \n \n \n \n \nA\np\n                                                 p\ne\n30  For the program duration, only the specific PSEs to be closed or privatized are expected to be notified. The actual  n\nd\nclosure or privatization will be done in a successive phase of program support. This is because a successful  ix\nclosure or privatization effort is assumed to take time particularly since each PSE to be so closed or privatized will    3\nneed a detailed audit of its books, which can take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to complete. Also, in the process \nof considering PSE restructuring, any specific action taken will incorporate the feedback of relevant unions, and a \nlabor specialist will be recruited to ensure that all labor issues are taken into account (Supplementary Appendix L).  1\n5\n   ", "16    \n1\n6\nTable 3: Financing Plan    \n($ million) \nSource  Total  %  A\np\np\nAsian Development Bank   94.00  74  e\nn\nState Government of Mizoram  32.96  26  d\nix\nTotal  126.96  100  1 \n0\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n56.  The Government of India has requested a loan of $94,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. India will \nbe the borrower. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n57.  The Government will relend in local currency 10% of the loan proceeds to SGM, which \nwill be in accordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external assistance to \nSGM. In this respect, (i) the loan funds will be treated as additional to Government transfers \nallocated annually to SGM, and (ii) the Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. The \nremaining 90% of the loan proceeds will be provided to SGM as grants and will be in addition to \nnormal grants provided by the Government. The program loan proceeds are expected to be \nutilized within 3 years from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n58.  A program steering committee (PSC) will be responsible for overall direction, guidance, \nand monitoring; and provide an oversight role under the program. The principal secretary of \nSGM's DOF will chair the committee, which will include the principal secretaries or secretaries of \nthe  Department  of  Planning  and  Program  Implementation  and  each  of  the  program \nimplementing agencies, including their heads of departments. The committee will report to the \nchief minister through the chief secretary. It will meet as and when necessary but at least once \nevery quarter. \n \n59.  A fiscal management unit (FMU), already established in the DOF, will serve as the \nprogram  management  unit,  facilitate  various  reforms,  and  be  responsible  for  daily \nimplementation of the program under the guidance of the PSC. The FMU will: (i) coordinate with, \nand help to the extent necessary, the various program implementing units (PIUs) established in \nrelevant  government  departments31 to  carry  out  their  functions  in  support  of  the  reforms; \n(ii) be responsible for daily implementation of the program under the guidance of the PSC; and \n(iii) coordinate with ADB and various stakeholders, and solicit feedback from experts from within \nand outside the government on a regular basis. The PIUs will liaise closely with the PSC \nthrough the help of, and in coordination with, the FMU. The PIUs, chaired by the head of the \nrelevant  department,  will  report  directly  to  the  principal  secretary  or  secretary  of  the \n                                                \n31  The participating departments, or implementing agencies, include Directorate of Accounts and Treasuries at the \nDepartment of Finance, and departments of taxation, public health engineering, transport, health and family \nwelfare, school education, and land revenue and settlement. \n ", "  17 \nimplementing agency. Details on the program implementation arrangements are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \n2.  Program Period and Tranching \n \n60.  The reforms supported under the Program are expected to be completed in 3 years, \nfrom August 2009 to July 2012. The program loan is to be released in three tranches to meet \nthe expected occurrence of associated costs of policy reforms: (i) first tranche of $47 million on \nloan effectiveness or shortly thereafter; (ii) second tranche of $40 million within 16 months of the \nfirst tranche and upon satisfactory compliance with all second tranche policy conditions (or \nearlier than 16 months if the conditions have been met); and (iii) third tranche of $7 million within \n14 months of the second tranche, subject to compliance with the conditions for their release (or \nearlier than 14 months if the conditions have been met). \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n61.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced, and procured, in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources (Appendix 6). \nThe Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Government in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures.32 \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n \n62.  The local currency generated from the loan proceeds will be used to finance adjustment \ncosts under the program, including (i) the VRS for teachers, (ii) the MHC Scheme corpus, and \n(iii) the premature retirement of high-cost debts. SGM will provide funding equivalent to $32.96 \nmillion to meet the remaining costs of the policy reforms. Expense items to be covered by SGM \nmatching funds under the TA loan are discussed in para. 78. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Risks \n \n63.  The  Government  and  SGM  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) and the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.33 Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, implementation of \nthe program will adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB reserves the right to review and \nexamine, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the program. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, \nwould be requested by ADB to be undertaken by SGM. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the program will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the program. \n \n64.  ADB affirms that corrupt behavior is a serious hindrance to the development process. It \nA\np\nrejects the argument that beneficial effects of corruption outweigh its negative consequences, or  p\ne\nthat it is inappropriate for international financial institutions to address such issues. ADB notes  n\nd\nthat  worldwide  experience  demonstrates  that  significant  progress  can  be  made  against  ix 3\n \n                                                \n32 ADB. 1998.

ADB welcomes the   \ngrowing focus upon anticorruption issues as part of its broader effort to advance the principles \nof transparency, predictability, accountability, and participation under its governance policy. At  A\np\np\nthe broadest level, ADB\u2019s stance on anticorruption issues is intended to reduce the burden that  e\nn\nwidespread, systemic corruption exacts upon the economies of the region and the development  d\nix\nof  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries.  In  keeping  with  Article  36(2)  of  the  Agreement  1 \n0\nEstablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,34 ADB  initiatives  regarding  corruption  will  be   \ngrounded  solely  upon  economic  considerations  and  concerns  of  sound  development \nmanagement. They will not involve interference in the political affairs of a developing member \ncountry or be influenced by its political character. \n \n65.  As part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines prescribed by implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan \n(Supplementary Appendix J). This assessment was complemented by a review of areas of \npossible  risks  and  vulnerability  in  state  financial  management. 35  The  governance  risk \nassessment identifies a number of vulnerabilities that could impact the program, including risks \nrelated  to:  (i)  institutional  dimensions  of  the  program  (e.g.,  weak  capacity  in  the  relevant \ninstitutions); (ii) government business processes (e.g., related to procurement processes); (iii) \naccountability and transparency (e.g., opaqueness in the usage of program resources); (iv) \nspecific program-related risks (e.g., unrealistic capacity development plans); and (v) exogenous \nrisks (e.g., secondary impacts of the current global economic slowdown). Issues raised by the \nfinancial assessment focus on five key areas of concern: (i) large variance in forecasting and \nbudget execution, (ii) lack of appraisal of investment projects and integration of capital and \ncurrent budgets, (iii) strong tendency toward spending a disproportionate share of funds in the \nlast quarter of the year or a \"last quarter rush\u2016, (iv) weak monitoring protocols, (v) lack of \nalignment  between  strategic  decisions  and  resource  allocations,  and  (vi)  absence  of  a \nperformance-based budget. While no significant risks of mismanagement of resources by the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  can  be  identified,  relevant  issues  identified  in  the \nassessments  are  targeted  in  the  TA  for  the  program,  for  which  substantial  resources  are \nprovided to build relevant capacities of SGM (paras. 71\u201376). SGM has publicly reinforced its \ncommitment to the program, and the new state government has fully accepted the reforms \ninherent in its design. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n66.  The Government and SGM will maintain separate records of accounts for the program. \nTo ensure proper fund management, ADB retains the right to audit the use of program loan \nproceeds. The FMU will prepare a quarterly consolidated progress report on implementation of \npolicy and institutional reforms, and will forward it to ADB at the time of submission to the PSC. \nThe reports will describe progress made in the program and any changes to the implementation \nschedule, and identify any problems encountered and remedial actions taken. Not later than 3 \nmonths after the program closing date, SGM will provide ADB with a program completion report, \nincluding an assessment of overall program performance. Appendix 1 provides a description of \nthe reporting schedule. \n \n7.  Program Monitoring \n \n67.  Program monitoring, in the first instance, will be done by the PSC, complemented by \nperiodic  ADB  review  missions  (along  with  that  of  the  Government,  as  necessary).  These \nmissions will: (i) confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release; (ii) confirm release of \n                                                \n34  ADB. 1966.

Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n68.  To facilitate proper program performance monitoring and evaluation, the FMU will, within \n6 months after the loan is effective, finalize a methodology and plan for monitoring program \nperformance using the targets, indicators, assumptions, and risks in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1), and in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). SGM and ADB will carry out \nperiodic reviews of the program, which will include tracking the fiscal indicators under the \nMTEFs, as well as progress in implementing relevant labor restructuring plans as part of PSE \nrestructuring or closure, as needed. Proper monitoring of attainment of targets and indicators \n(as well as incidence of risks) will facilitate dialogue with SGM in the event of subsequent \nfunding requests for continuation of policy reforms. \n \n9.  Program Review \n \n69.  Program reviews will be undertaken on a continuing basis. The PSC will meet as and \nwhen necessary, but at least once every quarter to review program progress, which will be \ncomplemented by yearly review missions of ADB and the Government. Program reviews will \nalso take place prior to the scheduled release of tranche 2 and 3 funds. These reviews will, \namong  others:  (i)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program  conditions  and \ncovenants, and (ii) identify relevant problems and constraints. If the reviews determine that \nchanges are required in program implementation, SGM and ADB will agree on measures, \nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that program obligations are met.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n70.  The primary outcome of the TA is strong SGM institutions that are responsible for reform \nprograms across various activities so that they can improve fiscal management performance.36 \nA key objective of the TA is also to support SGM to comply with all policy conditions under the \nprogram loan. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n71.  Revenue  Administration.  The  TA  will  support  computerization  of  land  revenue \nprocesses and offices, as well as capacity building in the area of revenue administration. The \nmain areas of focus are: (i) a functional requirement study based on the tax reform road map \nprepared by SGM, (ii) preparation of bidding documents for procurement of services of vendors \nfor  developing  the  tax  information  management  system,  (iii)  bid  process  management,  \n(iv) strengthening of audit processes, (v) program management support for implementation of \nthe information system, and (vi) training for revenue department officials. \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n                                                  3\n \n36  The project preparatory TA and work during program design has shown several areas where capacity gaps are \nsignificant, including in the areas of revenue administration, project appraisal and monitoring, preparation of \nMTEFs, treasury automation, and debt management.    1\n9\n   ", "20    \n2\n0\n72.  Project Appraisal and Monitoring. The TA will provide: (i) support to establish the   \nfinance commission and project monitoring cell in the DOF to ensure rigorous appraisal of \ngovernment projects, and (ii) expert advice to the cell on relevant processes.  A\np\np\n  e\nn\n73.  Preparation of MTEFs. The TA will provide support to the departments of health and  d\nix\nfamily welfare, of school education, and of finance to prepare and implement MTEFs; this will  1 \n0\ninclude expert advice and training.   \n \n74.  Treasury Automation. Support to the DOF to automate the nine treasuries in the state \nwill begin with a pilot of the largest treasury (South Aizawl) and, based on its success, the other \neight will be computerized during the program period. The TA will provide equipment and \ntechnology, and training support for management of the new systems. \n \n75.  Debt Management. Given the weaknesses identified with debt management in the state \n(para.  25),  the  TA  will  provide  support  to  enhance  capacity  in  various  areas  of  debt \nmanagement, including coordinating public debt information, analyzing total public debt, and \ndeveloping debt policies and strategies. In particular, the focus will be on: \n \n(i)  setting up debt recording and management systems, including automating the \ndebt management process and information base;37 \n(ii)  collating and processing relevant data on SGM guarantees and linking them with \ncontingent liabilities; \n(iii)  assessing risks in the debt portfolio as the state begins to rely more on market \nborrowings; \n(iv)  accessing various loans and financial instruments; \n(v)  accounting for debt transactions; \n(vi)  preparing a debt manual; and \n(vii)  operating a debt management cell. \n \n76.  Support  to  Program  Management.  The  TA  will  provide  support  to  program \nmanagement  and  coordination,  and  work  on  options  analysis  for  restructuring  PSEs  and \npension reforms. For all these areas of TA, various avenues to build capacity (such as on-the-\njob training, use of external training institutions, i.e., those outside Mizoram preferably in states \nwith similar programs, \u2015training the trainers\u2016 wherein the first batch of trainees will then provide \ntraining  to  the  staff  of  the  various  implementing  agencies)  will  be  explored.  All  program \nmanagement  work  related  to  information  technology  will  be  undertaken  by  a  government \ncounterpart staff that is an experienced professional and will ensure proper liaison with the firm \nproviding information technology services. Support to program management will include efforts \nto: (i) build the capacity of relevant sector ministries (i.e., education and health) to collect \ngender-disaggregated  information  on  a  systematic  basis,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  gender \nconsiderations are strongly taken into account in the implementation of the program, particularly \nthe subcomponent of the program that focuses on service improvements in the health sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n77.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $7.68  million  equivalent,  including  taxes,  interest, \ncommitment  charges,  and  contingencies.  The  costs  include  an  estimated  $0.30  million \nequivalent for taxes to be included in the TA loan. The amount equivalent to $0.32 million for \ninterest and commitment charges will be borne by the Government. The detailed cost estimates \n                                                \n37  For this, the industry good practice is to use the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording Management System \n(CS-DRMS), which is used by governments in more than 61 countries, including the Government of India (for \nexternal debt). The CS-DRMS is cost-free, although the annual maintenance charge is approximately $2,500. \n ", "  21 \nand a financing plan for the TA loan are in Appendix 7 (the terms of reference for consulting \nservices and other details are provided in Supplementary Appendix H).  \n \nTable 4: Financing Plan for Technical Assistance \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  6.00  78 \nState Government of Mizoram  1.36  18 \nGovernment of India  0.32  4 \n Total  7.68  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n78.  The Government has requested a loan of $6,000,000 from ADB's OCR to help finance \nthe TA project. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nSGM will finance $1.36 million equivalent, or 18% of the TA project cost to finance items such \nas  training  overhead,  remuneration  for  counterpart  staff,  and  administrative  costs.  The \nGovernment will finance interest and commitment charges of $0.32 million (Table 4). \n \n79.  The borrower will be India; the Government will relend the loan proceeds to SGM, which \nwill be in accordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external assistance to \nthe state government. It will relend 10% of the loan proceeds to SGM and provide 90% of the \nloan  proceeds  as grants. The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with: (i) the  reasons for  its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n80.  The DOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The implementing agencies include \nthe Directorate of Accounts and Treasuries at the DOF, and departments of taxation, public \nhealth engineering, land revenue and settlement, transport, health and family welfare, and \nschool education. The TA loan is intended to facilitate  program reforms and is, therefore, \nintegrated with program loan implementation. The implementation period of the TA will be from \nAugust 2009 (or loan effectiveness) to July 2012. \n \n81.  The program steering committee (PSC) under the program shall also be the PSC for the \nTA. The PSC shall be responsible for overall direction, guidance, monitoring, and providing an \noversight role under the TA. The PSC will be chaired by the principal secretary of the DOF, and \nwill include all principal secretaries or secretaries of each of the implementing agencies. The \nPSC will report to the chief minister through the chief secretary. The PSC will meet as and when \nnecessary but at least once every quarter. \n \n82.  The FMU will serve as the TA project management unit as well and will facilitate the \nvarious activities in the TA. The FMU will be responsible for daily implementation of the TA \nunder the guidance of the PSC. Toward this end, FMU will: (i) coordinate with, and help to the  A\np\nextent necessary, the various project implementing units (PIUs) established in each of the  p\ne\nimplementing agencies to carry out their functions in support of the TA, and (ii) coordinate with  n\nd\nADB and various stakeholders, and solicit feedback from experts from within and outside the  ix 3\ngovernment on a regular basis. The PIUs will liaise closely with the PSC through the FMU. Each   \n2\n1\n   ", "22    \n2\n2\nof the PIUs will be chaired by the head of the relevant department and will report directly to the   \nprincipal secretary or secretary of the respective implementing agency. \n  A\np\np\n83.  Disbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the TA loan will be made in  e\nn\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time)  d\nix\nand arrangements agreed between the Government and ADB. SGM may withdraw the loan  1 \n0\nproceeds through direct payment procedure for individual payments above $100,000 equivalent,   \nin which case the individual claims will be submitted through the Aid Accounts and Audit \nDivision of the Department of Economic Affairs. ADB will directly pay contractors, suppliers, and \nconsultants. Statement-of-expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nfor individual payments not exceeding $100,000. SGM may incur the expenditure from its own \nresources and submit a reimbursement claim through the Aid Accounts and Audit Division, in \nwhich case ADB will reimburse the division, and the funds will be transferred to SGM. \n \n84.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  Government  and  SGM  will  maintain \nseparate records of account for the TA loan. To ensure proper fund management, ADB retains \nthe right to audit the use of TA loan proceeds. The FMU will prepare quarterly consolidated \nprogress reports on specific actions taken in the TA and will forward them to ADB at the time of \nsubmission to the PSC. The reports will describe progress made in the TA and any changes to \nthe implementation schedule and procurement plan. It will identify any problems encountered \nand remedial actions taken. Not later than 3 months after the TA closing date, SGM will provide \nADB with a TA completion report, including an assessment of overall TA performance. Appendix \n1 provides a description of the reporting schedule for the TA. \n \n85.  The PSC and ADB will monitor the TA as an integral part of the program performance \nmanagement  system.  The  TA  inputs,  process,  and  output  indicators  will  be  monitored  to \ndetermine  how  they  affect  impact.  Capacity  building  requirements  will  be  continuously \nmonitored and reassessed so that capacity building can be tracked as an ongoing process. ADB \nwill combine TA reviews with program reviews (para. 69). Special attention will be paid to the \ncapacity of the FMU as it will be the center of program and TA implementation. \n \n86.  Procurement  and  Consultant  Selection.  Procurement  of  goods  and  works  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The methods of procurement for goods and \nconsulting services will include (i) for goods, national competitive bidding (between $100,000 \nand  $500,000)  and  shopping  (below  $100,000);  and  (ii)  for  consulting  services,  individual \nselection (using the curriculum vitae method\u2014for contracts below $10,000 per month) and \nquality- and cost-based selection for firms for contracts of $100,000 or higher. The procurement \nplan for the TA is in Appendix 8.  \n \n87.  A total of 207 person-months of national consulting services are expected to be required \nfor  the  TA.  All  necessary  consulting  services  will  be  delivered  intermittently  during  TA \nimplementation.  National  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  individual  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime); consulting contracts will be between the Executing Agency and the consultants. ADB will \nfinalize terms of reference and other related issues in consultation with SGM (outline terms of \nreferences are included in Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  23 \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n88.  The expected benefits of the program will be evident at the macro level in the creation of \ngreater fiscal space for SGM, which will enable it to make greater investments in social and \neconomic  development  activities.  The  program  loan  will  help  improve  SGM\u2019s  revenue \nadministration, and strengthen expenditure management and debt management; it will also put \nstate economic reforms on a sustainable path. \n \n89.  The program benefits are expected to be evident in: (i) the availability of more resources \nto invest in social and economic infrastructure in the state, which should ultimately assist in \nenhancing the welfare of the poor in rural areas; (ii) more efficient allocation of budget resources \nbased on outcomes sought rather than in an incremental and ad hoc manner; and (iii) the ability \nof SGM, in the long term, to place its fiscal affairs on a sounder footing that can sustain \ninvestments for more rapid and inclusive growth. The program will help SGM to gain specific \nbenefits in the following: \n \n(i)  greater consideration of outcomes and medium-term considerations in resource \nallocations (largely through reliance on the MTEFs); \n(ii)  better  pension  management  for  SGM  employees  (by  moving  to  a  defined \ncontribution scheme from one of defined benefits); \n(iii)  more streamlined tax administration; \n(iv)  more objective valuation of fixed public assets, such as properties; \n(v)  better handling of risk-based audits; \n(vi)  more effective treasuries given their computerization; \n(vii)  better knowledge of the contingent liabilities of the state, and better management \nof the debt overhang; \n(viii)  improved services in the education sector through the recruitment of qualified \nteachers to replace underqualified ones;38 and \n(ix)  ability to put the MHC Scheme on a sustainable footing given the establishment \nof the corpus to ensure continued availability of funds to meet the annual costs of \nscheme management. \n \n90.  In the long-term, as the program seeks to strengthen SGM\u2019s fiscal affairs, the economic \ngrowth rate should respond positively. If indeed the state is to catch up to the all-India average \ngross domestic product growth rate, then creation of greater fiscal space and improvements of \nservices in key sectors are the only viable options in the short and medium term. A higher \ngrowth rate and GSDP will mean that the entire public will eventually benefit from the program. \nThe impact of the Program should also be felt in the medium term by the poor in rural areas; this \nis expected to be direct in cases of health and education, and indirect in other cases of fiscal \nreforms in the state economy. The program should create opportunities for SGM to invest in \nmuch-needed infrastructure that will allow the broader state economy to be better integrated. A \nsummary poverty reduction analysis is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n \nA\np\n                                                 p\ne\n38  In the process of retiring unqualified teachers (and recruiting more qualified ones), engagement with the relevant  n\nd\nteachers' unions has been initiated. The unions have accepted the VRS package, and SGM is committed to  ix\nensuring that an open process of communication is put in place and adhered to. As for PSE restructuring or    3\nclosure, a similar process of public awareness will be put in place once specific assessments are completed and \nthe recommended course of action is made public. This will be captured in a labor restructuring plan; funds to \nprocure relevant expertise in this area are dedicated in the TA loan.    2\n3\n   ", "24    \n2\n4\nB.  Assumptions, Risks, and Safeguards   \n \n1.  Assumptions and Risks  A\np\np\n  e\nn\n91.  The  program\u2019s  success  depends  on  SGM\u2019s  continuing  strong  commitment  to  fiscal  d\nix\nreforms. This is already clearly evident. As a result of the state elections of December 2008, the  1 \n0\nCongress Party formed the new government, and it has fully accepted the program proposals.39   \nOther primary assumptions made in the program include: (i) existing central policies that are \nfavorable to the state will continue to be in place in the medium to long term; (ii) the greater \nfiscal space will result in the reorientation of expenditure to social and economic infrastructure; \n(iii) SGM will set aside adequate resources to match the TA funds for capacity building, and the \ncapacity building plans are realistic; (iv) the VRS in the education sector is backed by capacity \nbuilding  opportunities;  and  (v)  the  Thirteenth  Finance  Commission  will  make  favorable \nrecommendations to the state in the matter of intergovernmental fiscal transfers. \n \n92.  The main risks that are likely to arise and impact the program are: (i) weaknesses in the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  relevant  government  agencies;  (ii)  weak  government  business \nprocesses, (iii) fiduciary risks relating to the use of loan proceeds; and (iv) external risks (e.g., \nslower growth constricting the flow of funds to the state from the center). Of these, the program \nconsiders institutional weaknesses to be a type 1 risk (i.e., one that needs urgent attention for \nthe program outcome to be fully realized). \n \n93.  Mitigation measures for these risks include: \n \n(i)  specific TA such that institutional weaknesses are effectively targeted; \n(ii)  support for realignment and review of relevant government business processes, \nsuch as procurement; \n(iii)  preparation of the sector road maps and MTEFs, and engagement with SGM to \nensure that recruitment of replacement teachers is in accordance  with merit \ncriteria; \n(iv)  requirement of periodic reports from SGM to ensure that fund flows are tracked \nas per program requirements; \n(v)  regular and dedicated monitoring of program activities such that sustainability of \npolicy reforms is effectively tracked; \n(vi)  conducting relevant due diligence for all program and TA components that impact \nfund draw-downs;  \n(vii)  assurance  that  the  VRS  for  teachers  is  rigorously  designed  and  effectively \nimplemented; \n(viii)  ring-fencing for specific program investments, such as the health corpus and the \nVRS for teachers; and \n(ix)  detailed review of the relevance of all capacity development initiatives that relate \nto the program. \n \n2.  Safeguards \n \n94.  The program was evaluated for its impact on various relevant ADB and Government \nsafeguards, and no impact was judged to be evident on the environment, resettlement, or \nindigenous populations as a result of program policy interventions. For all three instances, the \nprogram is rated a category C. \n \n                                                \n39  The new state government reviewed the aide memoire of the November 2008 Fact-Finding Mission and confirmed \nit without making any changes in program content, design, scope, or methodology. \n ", "  25 \nVII.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n95.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the Government  and  SGM  have  given  the \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n96.  Program Loan.

SGM will use these counterpart funds to support the adjustment costs for \nthe policies adopted and actions taken for program implementation, and ensure \nthat sufficient budgetary allocations are made in a timely manner for the efficient \nand timely implementation of the program. \n(iii)  SGM will provide matching funds for: (a) complete disbursement of the VRS and \nrelated compensation for school teachers, as necessary; (b) augmentation of the \nhealth corpus to ensure its sustainability; and (c) augmentation of the Guarantee \nRedemption Fund to ensure compliance with the relevant tranche conditions. \n(iv)  The Government and SGM will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for \nimplementation of the program, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government and SGM will take \ninto account ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \n(v)  SGM will endeavor that: (a) critical program staff will remain in their position on a \nfull-time basis for a reasonable duration to ensure continuity in implementation of \nthe program; and (b) all implementing agencies will be adequately staffed and \nprovided with the necessary financial, technical, and other resources to perform \ntheir functions under the program. \n(vi)  SGM will ensure that any communication relating to the implementation of VRS \ncompensation for teachers is made available to all teachers uniformly. \n(vii)  SGM will approve a time-bound action plan on staffing, computerization, and \nreporting arrangements for the finance commission and project monitoring cell, \nas well as the FMU. \n(viii)  SGM will ensure that all relevant baseline data related to the program and its \ncomponents will be regularly monitored and continually updated. Within 6 months \nafter the loan is effective, SGM will finalize a methodology or plan for monitoring \nthe performance of the program in line with the design and monitoring framework \nand the policy matrix. \n(ix)  SGM will establish a fund flow tracking system to track the use of the counterpart \nfunds generated by the loan on a quarterly basis, particularly on ring-fenced \nprogram investments (such as high-cost debt prepayment, the health corpus, and \nA\np\nthe VRS for teachers).  p\ne\n(x)  SGM will ensure that (a) consultation plans will be prepared for, and applied to,  n\nd\nteachers affected by reforms; (b) men and women will be given equal access to,  ix 3\nand use of, relevant services, resources, assets, and opportunities in the MHC   \nScheme  and  VRS;  (c)  the  implementing  agencies  will  receive  support  in \n2\n5\n   ", "26    \n2\n6\nupgrading  their  information  gathering  capabilities;  (d)  specific  health  care   \nproducts for women will be made available in the MHC Scheme; and (e) a labor \nrestructuring plan will be prepared once it is determined the PSEs that are to be  A\np\np\nrestructured.  e\nn\n  d\nix\n97.  TA Loan. Specific assurances include the following:  1 \n0\n   \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the TA loan proceeds will be transferred to \nSGM under the normal arrangements for transferring external assistance to SGM. \nFurther, the Government will ensure that such transfer will be additional to the \ntransfer allocated annually to SGM.  \n(ii)  SGM will provide matching funds for TA implementation on time. Each of the \nimplementing  agencies  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation  requests  and  SGM  will  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of TA implementation.  \n(iii)  SGM will ensure that the TA loan proceeds and the matching funds will be \nprovided  to  each  of  the  implementing  agencies  promptly  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the TA. \n(iv)  SGM  will  ensure  that  the  capacity  development  plans  of  each  of  the \nimplementing agencies will be updated annually. \n(v)  SGM will ensure that equal opportunity will be given to men and women staff \nfrom each of the executing and implementing agencies to receive the various \ntraining provided under the TA. SGM will include a list of the training participants, \nin the quarterly report, to show the number of women staff who participated in the \nvarious training programs.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n98.  The following actions will be required before the program and TA loans can be declared \neffective: \n \n(i)  the Program Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on \nbehalf of the Government and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other \nthan  conditions  requiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  TA  Loan  Agreement,  the \nProgram Agreement, and the Project Agreement) will have been fulfilled; \n(ii)  the TA Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of \nthe Government and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than \nconditions requiring the effectiveness of the Program Loan Agreement, Program \nAgreement, and the Project Agreement) will have been fulfilled; \n(iii)  the Program Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of \nthe state and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than conditions \nrequiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  Program  Agreement,  the  Program  Loan \nAgreement, and the Project Agreement) will have been fulfilled; and \n(iv)  the Project Agreement will have been executed and delivered on behalf of the \nstate  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness  (other  than  conditions \nrequiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  Project  Agreement,  the  Program  Loan \nAgreement, and the Program Agreement) will have been fulfilled. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  27 \nVIII.

Analysis of the deficit ratios to gross state domestic product (GSDP) shows an overall \nimprovement in the revenue deficit situation in Mizoram since 2003/04. The revenue account, \nwith a gross state domestic product (GSDP) deficit of 11% in 2000/01, has seen a complete \nturnaround and is expected to have a surplus of almost 6.5% in 2008/09 (Table A2.1). While the \nsignificant contribution from central transfers cannot be ignored, improved performance by the \nstate in raising own revenues is also a factor. The fiscal deficit, however, remained high during \nthe analysis period. Rising revenue surpluses helped the state to augment capital outlays, while \npreventing the fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio to rise further. The difference between fiscal and \nprimary deficits has been quite high, implying that any attempt to reduce interest payments \nshould have a significant favorable impact on the state economy.  \n \nTable A2.1: Overall Fiscal Performance: Deficit Ratios in Mizoram \n(% of GSDP) \nItem  2000/01  2001/02  2002/03  2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08  2008/09 \nRevenue Deficit   11.1  13.4  5.0  \u20133.6  \u20134.3  \u20132.4  \u20138.4  \u20134.0  \u20136.5 \nFiscal Deficit  21.6  21.7  14.6  13.1  9.6  14.7  6.4  11.9  10.1 \nPrimary Deficit   15.8  14.2  8.4  6.0  2.2  7.9  \u20131.6  5.6  3.9 \n\u2013 = surplus. \nSources (basic data): Budget documents, government of Mizoram. \n \n2.  Results of Reliance on the Central Government \n \n2.  The public finances of Mizoram are heavily dependent on transfers from the Government \nof India (the Government). This has two aspects: (i) the part of available nondebt resources that \ncan be spent in a way decided wholly by the state is somewhat circumscribed; these comprise \nits small own-tax and nontax revenues; and (ii) the fact that plan transfers are available to the \nstate as 90% grants and 10% loans has created a sense of complacency regarding debt buildup \nover a long period, until very recently reflected in the persistently high fiscal deficit. Thus, the \ncomposition of expenditures is not largely the state\u2018s own making, implying its correspondingly \nweak control over it. \n \nB.  Trends in Receipts and Expenditures \n \n1.  State Government Resources \n \n3.  Total revenues increased from 48% of GSDP in 2000/01 to 62% in 2007/08. All revenue \ncomponents contributed to this increase. For example, own revenues increased from 4.3% to \n6.3% of GSDP, while transfers from the central Government increased from 44.5% to almost \n55% of GSDP (the share of central taxes more than doubled from 5% of GSDP to 11% of \nGSDP). However, in terms of 2007/08 figures, the state\u2018s own receipts constituted only a little \n                                                \n1  The term \u2015\u2017sector\u2016\u2018 as used here does not reflect the usual meaning of a sphere of definable economic activity \n(such as transport, power, agriculture) but refers more to the general macroeconomic components and variables of \nrevenue, expenditures, debts, pensions, public sector enterprise activities, for example. This is relevant for a \nprogram of this nature because it helps give the proper context to the outcome of fiscal space in the state \neconomy. \n ", "36   Appendix 2 \nover 10% of total revenue receipts. Adding the share of central taxes, this percentage rises to \nabout 28%. Given that central grants have been increasingly allocated to specific purposes, the \nuntied resources of the state are estimated at about 50% at best, with the utilization of the other \nhalf predetermined\u2014an important factor when assessing the finances of a state like Mizoram.2 \n \n4.  During 2001/02 to 2007/08, revenue receipts exhibited average annual growth of more \nthan 18%. Central transfers, constituting the larger share of total revenue receipts grew at about \nthe same rate as the total, while the relatively small component of own receipts grew at about \n23% annually on average.  \n \n5.  Of the important sources of own-tax revenue, sales tax and taxes on vehicles have been \nperforming well. Sales taxes have been the subject of a number of reform initiatives including \nminimum floor rates of tax for several commodities, some of which were not previously taxed in \nthe state. This regime shift has raised tax collections significantly. A changeover to value-added \ntax (VAT) contributed to enhancing the rate of growth of collections. However, excise collections \nhave been low in the state as a result of the introduction of prohibition. \n \n6.  The introduction of the VAT has meant new challenges for tax administration. The pre-\nVAT sales tax regime had only 660 registered dealers; now, 4,013 VAT dealers are registered in \nthe state. In addition, the goods and service tax, which is likely to be introduced in all states on  \n1 April 2010, will require tax officials to have renewed skills, dynamism, and sophistication. \nTherefore, suitable restructuring of the Taxation Department is needed soon. Moreover, a risk-\nbased module should be developed for audit where selection is not influenced by human \nintervention (in most cases) but determined by automated risk assessments. This will improve \nthe efficiency of tax administration. \n \n2.  Public Expenditures \n \n7.  The  public  expenditure-led  growth  strategy  is  manifested  in  high  government \nexpenditure in Mizoram. As a ratio to GSDP, total expenditure increased from 68% to almost \n79% between 2001/02 and 2007/08. Revenue expenditures have been 57% to 59% of GSDP in \nrecent years. This is exceptionally high by the average standard in India. The main contributor \nto the increase in total expenditure has been the increase in capital expenditure, especially the \nincrease in capital outlay. Within revenue expenditures, general services show modest average \nannual growth of about 8%, with interest payments at an even lower rate (of a little more than \n6%). Expenditures on social services grew at about 14% and economic services at 12%. The \nrelative growth rates are significant  as general services have claimed a share of revenue \nexpenditures lower than social services but higher than economic services. Given that the latter \ntwo broadly constitute development expenditures, both components should ideally be higher \nthan general services. This is not so at present, but given the trends general services could \nbecome the smallest part of the three components in the near future. Capital outlays managed \nan increasing trend from 2004/05 to 2007/08.  \n \n8.  The ratio of interest payments to GSDP has remained steady at around 7%, before \nincreasing to 8% in 2006/07 and then dropping to 6.3% in 2007/08. \n \n                                                \n2  An element of uncertainty surrounds tax devolution to the states because it depends on gross tax collection at the \ncentral Government (the share of states in the net proceeds of shareable central taxes is 30.5%). The implications \nof this are more acute in a state where the share of own revenue in total revenue is very small. As a result, the \nshare of own revenue in total expenditure is also very small. With tax reforms proposed under the program, the \nsituation is expected to improve noticeably. \n ", "Appendix 2  37 \nTable A2.2: Overall Expenditure Profile in Mizoram \n(% of GSDP) \nItem  2001/02  2002/03  2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \nExpenditures  68.37  64.84  78.49  74.04  80.48  76.61  78.75 \nRevenue Expenditures  57.93  52.19  55.36  56.83  58.84  57.33  57.74 \nof which: Interest Payments  7.50  6.10  7.20  7.39  6.84  8.00  6.30 \n                Pensions  2.50  2.20  2.80  3.60  3.3  2.60  3.00 \nGross Capital Expenditure  10.44  12.65  23.13  17.21  21.65  19.28  21.01 \nof which: Capital Outlay  7.12  8.68  15.99  13.43  16.73  15.57  16.47 \nGSDP = gross state domestic product. \nSource: Government of Mizoram\u2013figures have been rounded off. \n \n9.  Among  development  expenditure,  that  on  education  at  all  levels\u2014elementary, \nsecondary, higher, technical, adult education, and language development\u2014has been around \n40% of expenditure on all social services in the past few years. The ratio of total education \nexpenditure to the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic services on capital and \nrevenue has been more or less stable at 0.14%. Within education expenditure, the share of \nelementary education has been more or less stable at 48%, while that of secondary education \nhas fluctuated in the range of 20%\u201322% from 2003/04 to 2007/08. The greater emphasis on \nelementary  education  is  a  result  of  the  Government\u2018s  flagship  program  for  elementary \neducation\u2014the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.  \n \n10.  Expenditure on health and family welfare as a percent of expenditure on all social \nservices  declined  from  16.4%  in  2003/04  to  11.8%  in  2007/08.  The  ratio  of  total  health \nexpenditure to the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic services also declined \nfrom 0.05% in 2003/04 to 0.04% in 2007/08. This trend of declining spending on health relative \nto total spending may be a cause for concern. \n \n11.  Pensions  remain  one  of  the  major  components  of  unfunded  liabilities.  The  state \ngovernment of Mizoram (SGM) has a defined benefit scheme of pensions for its employees. \nThe  revisions  of  pay  and  pensions  by  decennial  pay  commissions  and  the  increase  in \nemployment when Mizoram acquired statehood in 1987 seem to have had an impact on surging \npension expenditures. Utilizing broad aggregates of retirement expenditure as available from \nthe Accountant General\u2018s Annual Finance and Accounts for SGM, it is seen that expenditure on \naccount of retirement benefits as a percent of GSDP peaked at 3.6% (in 2004/05) before \ndecelerating to 3.0% in 2007/08. The peaks were explained to be due to the substantial addition \nto the pension system as a result of the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) of SGM for a \nparticular section of transport department employees. \n \nC.  State Indebtedness \n \n12.  The ratio of public debt to GSDP remained above 80% during 2002\u20132008. The debt \nratios  are  clearly  substantially  above  the  limit  of  28%  suggested  by  the  Twelfth  Finance \nCommission. The total direct debt outstanding at the close of 2007/08 was Rs19.201 billion; 239 \nloans were outstanding on that date.

The data on SGM guarantees is available only until 31 March 2007. It shows that SGM \nbacked loans totaling Rs2.49 billion taken by statutory corporations and other government \ninstitutions. As of 31 March 2007, the total principal and interest payment outstanding on these \nloans  was  close  to  Rs1.5  billion.  SGM  has  not  specified  an  indicative  limit  up  to  which \nguarantees can be issued. The Department of Finance is examining and issuing guarantees on \na case-by-case basis. \n \n14.  The large and increasing fiscal imbalance in the state during the late 1990s and the early \npart of this decade became a matter of serious policy concern. The uncontrolled fiscal deficit \nand increased resort to borrowings have made the task of bringing about macroeconomic \nstabilization much more difficult and complex. High debt stock, in turn, led to further escalation \nof current expenditure due to higher interest payments. Thus, the state is trapped in a vicious \ncycle of debt-deficit dynamics, and one of the fundamental reasons for initiating fiscal reforms is \nto reduce the Mizoram debt stock to a sustainable amount.  \n \n15.  Debt Sustainability. Determination of this sustainable amount of debt stock can be \nanalyzed in terms of annual borrowings (see Supplementary Appendix C). For example, a 28% \ndebt stock to GSDP ratio and 12% nominal growth rate will imply that total borrowing should not \nexceed  3%  of  GSDP  to  maintain  the  debt  sustainability  condition.  Some  counterfactual \nscenarios can be presented to highlight the sustainable level of public debt in Mizoram if the \nfiscal deficit target of 3%\u20135% is achieved. Mizoram current debt stock is Rs30.625 billion as of \n31 March 2008, which is 93% of GSDP.3   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n3 Government of Mizoram. 2008.

Thus, the debt stock to GSDP ratio must be reduced if the state is required to maintain \nthe fiscal deficit at 3%\u20134% of GSDP. This cannot be achieved over a short span of time. A \ncombination  of  debt  restructuring  and  strong  fiscal  corrections  is  needed  to  arrive  at  a \nsustainable level of public debt over the medium term. \n \nD.  Fiscal Impact of Public Sector Enterprises \n \n17.  Poor performance of state public sector enterprises (PSEs) has adversely affected the \nstate budget. They include five small PSEs4 and two departmental undertakings (Mizoram State \nTransport, and Power and Electricity Department). The activities of the PSEs are concentrated \nin industrial development and finance, handloom and handicrafts, food processing, electronic \ndevelopment, agriculture, and marketing. As of 31 March 2007, the total investment in PSEs \nwas  Rs892  million  (equity  of  Rs463  million,  long-term  loans  of  Rs335  million,  and  share \napplication money of Rs94 million). The PSEs are largely in extreme financial difficulty requiring \nhuge amounts of support.  \n \n18.  In terms of the budgetary outflow to government companies, despite periodic infusion of \nequity  capital  and  grants,  they  continue  to  report  losses.  The  liability  of  SGM  for  these \nenterprises  also  reflects  guarantees  provided  for  their  borrowing.  The  losses  of  the \ndepartmental undertakings are also increasing (Table A2.5). In 2000/01, losses for these two \nundertakings  totaled  Rs311  million,  which  increased  in  only  5  years  to  Rs952  million;  in \n2007/08, this had subsided to Rs737 million. \n \nTable A2.5: Losses of Departmental Undertakings \n(Rs million) \nCompany  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \nMizoram State Transport  120.68  107.62  104.65  126.11 \nPower and Electricity Department  707.51  721.75  847.73  610.94 \nTotal  828.19  829.37  952.38  737.05 \nSource: Government of Mizoram. \n \nE.  Recent Policy Decisions for Fiscal Corrections \n \n19.  To  regulate  the  imbalance  between  receipt  and  expenditure,  the  Twelfth  Finance \nCommission recommended the drawing up of a monitorable fiscal reforms program by state \ngovernments to increase their revenue income and reduce nonplan expenditure. Accordingly, \n                                                \n4 These are (i) Zoram Industrial Development Corporation Ltd., (ii) Mizoram Handloom and Handicrafts Development \nCorporation Ltd., (iii) Mizoram Food and Allied Industries Corporation Ltd., (iv) Zoram Electronics Development \nCorporation Ltd., and (v) Mizoram Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation Ltd. \n ", "40   Appendix 2 \nSGM drew up a program and took up various steps to achieve the stipulated fiscal parameters \n(Table A2.6). It enacted the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in \nDecember 2006, including objectives to eliminate the revenue deficit and reduce the fiscal \ndeficit to 3% of GSDP by 2008/09. SGM brought out the FRBM Rules in 2007, introducing \nvarious measures for additional resource mobilization (such as enhancement of various tax \nrates, and widening of the tax base). It also undertook various austerity measures to reduce \nexpenditures  with  special  emphasis  on  nonplan  revenue  expenditure.  SGM  efforts  have \ngenerated  a  revenue  surplus.  However,  the  reform  efforts  need  to  be  consolidated  and \nincreased to reduce the fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio to a manageable level.  \n \n20.  In recent years, SGM has undertaken various reform measures, fiscal, institutional, or \nsectoral. Among them, the fiscal measures have direct bearing on the fiscal performance of the \nstate. These measures include: (i) assessment of water charges based on meter reading; (ii) \nimposition of tolls on roads and bridges; (iii) collection of water cess in selected areas on minor \nirrigation;  (iv)  implementation  of  VAT  on  1  April  2005;  (v)  measures  to  augment  revenue \ncollection by both enhancing existing rates of taxes, fees, and tariffs as well as by introduction of \nnew measures; (vi) economy measures such as non-filling up of vacant posts; (vii) moratorium \non  fresh  recruitment,  etc.;  and  (viii)  preparation  of  medium-term  fiscal  reforms  plan.  The \ntransition  to  a  VAT  has  been  very  revenue-productive  for  the  state\u2014in  the  first  year  of \nintroduction of the tax, the state recorded 47% increase in receipts.  \n \nTable A2.6: Fiscal Parameters \n(as % of GSDP) \nItem  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08  2008/09 (RE) \nA.

Assessing the efficacy of the budgetary forecasts in Mizoram is difficult. Table A2.7 \nshows  clearly  that  both  receipts  and  expenditures  are  rather  underestimated  in  the  base \nestimate, going up substantially in the revised estimates. The change from revised estimates to \n ", "Appendix 2  41 \nactual is not normally significant since the revised estimate figures are now usually based on \nrealized amounts for 10 months out of 12. In Mizoram, however, the revised estimate figures are \nbased on realized amounts for 9 months. The forecasting error from revised estimates to actual \nmay, therefore, be expected to be a little larger than in most other states of India. Thus, broadly \nspeaking, the base estimate figures appear to underestimate the actual. \n \nTable A2.7: Fiscal Marksmanship \n(Rs million) \n  2006/07  2007/08 \nItem  BE  RE  Actual  BE  RE \nRevenue Expenditure  15,600  20,508  17,173  17,735  19,738 \nRevenue Receipts  16,950  18,934  19,690  19,364  23,624 \nCapital Disbursements  4,070  6,036  5,776  4,792  7,308 \nOf which, Capital Outlay  2,413  4,825  4,664  2,886  5,414 \nBE = base estimate, RE = revised estimates. \nSources: Government of Mizoram budget documents. \n \n22.  But the underestimation caused by forecasting errors is mixed with another factor, which \nmakes assessing the quality of forecasting difficult. Because the state\u2018s public finances are so \nheavily dependent on central transfers (of which a large part is difficult to forecast with any \nconfidence because of their irregular nature), the base estimates are deliberately conservative \nin deference to financial prudence. If and when SGM is certain that additional transfers may be \nforthcoming, it completes a midcourse adjustment by introducing a supplementary budget. If the \ncentral transfers are not so large in a particular year, this procedure ensures that expenditures \ndo not rise too much relative to receipts. Thus, the regular use of supplementary budgets (that is \nusually frowned upon as an indication of weak expenditure control) is, in fact, a tool of cautious \nbudgetary  policy  in  Mizoram.  Given  this  tendency,  the  comparison  of  actual  budgetary \noutcomes with base estimates shows not only a forecasting error but also an element of \ndeliberate underestimation\u2014disentangling the two elements is difficult. This is complicated by \nthe possibility that the difference could also be partly ascribed to inadequate budget execution, \nwhich could have actually gone either way\u2014judging its direction is impossible. \n ", " 42  Appendix 3 \n 4\n2\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX   \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 2\n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  43 \nA\np\np\ne\nn\n  d\nix\n 3\n \n4\n3\n   ", " 44  Appendix 3 \n 4\n4\n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 2\n \n ", " \nTable A3.1: Mizoram Public Resource Management Program\u2014Policy Matrix \n \n  Second Tranche  Third Tranche \nFirst Tranche  (16 months after loan effectiveness)  (14 months after release of second tranche) \nA.

Poverty Analysis and Strategy \n \n1.  Link  to  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  and  Country  Partnership \nStrategy \n \n1.  The  Government  of  India\u2018s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  focuses  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment, social development, and agriculture and rural development for more inclusive \ngrowth. The approach paper to the 11th Five Year Plan also reaffirms the importance of strong \nstate government fiscal management. ADB country partnership strategy and country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  India1  emphasize  these  objectives  through  public\u2013private  partnerships, \nagribusiness  infrastructure,  rural  finance,  irrigation,  and  improved  water  resources \nmanagement.  \n \n2.  Poverty Analysis \n \n2.  Key  Issues.  Two  key  issues  dominate  the  poverty  aspects  of  fiscal  management \nreforms: (i) Human poverty as distinct from income poverty: poverty has to be seen not only in \nterms of income but also in terms of, for example, accessibility to affordable services. The \nProgram  argues  that  necessary  fiscal  reforms  have  to  be  translated  into  measurable \nimprovements in services in social sectors. (ii) Capacity building: reducing poverty through \nmacroeconomic and fiscal reforms is only possible when the policy reform agenda is backed by \nstrong capacity of government departments to deliver on the reform agenda. \n \n3.  Main findings from the poverty and social assessment also reveal that while the program \ndoes not directly impact poverty reduction in the state, three specific  issues are relevant:  \n(i) more streamlined tax and nontax revenue reforms mean a fair system with no bias against \nlow-income groups; (ii) proper debt management and rationalization of expenditures mean the \nfiscal space for greater social spending directly impacts poor people; and (iii) the impacts of \nsocial investments in health and education are more directly visible on the poor. \n \n4.  Design Features. Important features of the program are: (i) support for SGM to continue \nits focus on economic  and social development; (ii) help for  SGM to better align resource \nallocation to desired long-term outcomes in two sectors; (iii) help for SGM to carry forward its \nreform agenda in the social sectors; and (iv) alignment with the outcomes and new initiatives of \nSGM in the area of fiscal reforms and management (this includes the reform agenda that the \nnew government is pursuing). \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2005.

All these will ultimately, albeit in an indirect manner, have a positive impact on the poor.

Key issues in the program include (i) how to enhance effectiveness of and efficiencies in \nsector services to socially vulnerable populations;21(ii) how to ensure greater access to, and \naffordability for, the services for these groups; and (iii) how to minimize costs in the long term so \nthat poor people do not disproportionately suffer for having to pay for ineffective services.32 \n \n2.

Both in the health and the education sectors, the gender roles and gender \nimpacts are substantially different. Greater accessibility to basic health care options will mean \ngreater coverage for women and children. Health care products designed to benefit women \nmore are also likely to be made available, which will enhance the impact of the program on \ngender. In the education sector, no substantial differences are anticipated in the services to be \nmade more accessible and available across gender lines.  \n \n11.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote equality between men\u2018s and \nwomen\u2018s access to, and use of, relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities: \n \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n                                                \n21For the purpose of this program, \u2016vulnerable\u2016 and \u2016disadvantaged\u2016 are defined to include the poor, as well as those \nwho face discrimination and/or abuse as a result of their gender, race, ethnic identity, or other personal attributes. \nPoverty and discrimination of this kind undercut disadvantaged groups\u2018 ability to access basic social services. \n32A related issue is that poorer households borrow from money lenders at an abnormally high cost to meet health \nexpenses; this has a profound impact on income poverty. \n43 These consultations took place in the project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2008.

A\n54The analysis here is based on the results of the consultations that have taken place to date. During program  pp\ne\nimplementation, ADB will work with SGM to ensure that a detailed consultation plan on the VRS scheme and on  n\nd\nthe PSE restructuring is prepared. This is more difficult for the latter exercise since work on preparing the  ix\nrecommendations for PSE restructuring has not yet commenced. The labor restructuring plan (Supplementary  9  \nAppendix L) will incorporate the results of the consultations as well. \n6\n7\n   ", " 68   Appendix 9 \n \n6\n8\n   \n12.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  program  will  encourage  SGM  to  develop,  and  make \navailable, specific health care products for women.
