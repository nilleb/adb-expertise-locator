The interventions will focus on the Ferghana Valley in the southwest \nof the country and the Chui River Basin in the north, which are vulnerable to flooding, landslides \n(including mudflows), and drought risks that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nContext  of  vulnerability.  With  steep  mountain  geography  and  variable  weather \nconditions,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  highly  disaster-prone.  Disasters  triggered  by  climatic  and \ngeophysical natural hazards are frequent and estimated to cost the country equivalent to 1.0%\u2013\n1.5%  of gross  domestic product  annually.2  Much  of  the  population  is  vulnerable and exposed, \nwith limited resources to  mitigate and  recover from  disaster  impacts.  A primary  avenue  of this \nvulnerability  is  through  the  water  resources  sector,  including  irrigated  agriculture.  Irrigation  is \ncritical for sustained agricultural production in the Kyrgyz Republic, which engages about 30% of \nthe population (including about 45% of the lower-income rural population) and contributes about \n15% of gross domestic product.3 \n \nNotable  water-related  disaster  events  include  severe  droughts  (2009  and  2014)  in  the \n4. \nnorthern  districts,  and  landslides  (2003  and  2004)  and  flooding  (2007  and  2012)  in  the \nsouthwestern districts.4 Future climatic change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude \nof such events. Drought and associated water stress may occur more often as temperatures rise. \nPrecipitation  and  snowmelt  patterns  are  expected  to  change  adversely,  with  water  availability \ndeclining in the face of growing competing demands.5 Landslides and floods are likely to become \nmore frequent as a result of melting permafrost and more intense precipitation events.6 \n \nSector  institutional  context.  The  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  (MOES)  and  the \n5. \nDepartment of Water Resources and Melioration (DWR) under the Ministry of Agriculture, Food \nIndustry, and Melioration are the primary agencies for DRM in the water resources sector. The \nMOES is the national institution for cross-sector civil protection, including disaster prevention and \nrehabilitation, along the main water courses. The Agency for Hydrometeorology under the MOES, \n                                                \n1  The project was prepared under Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

Manila (TA 8119-REG). \n \n\n\f2 \n\nor  KyrgyzHydromet,  is the  national  institution for  hydrometeorological  monitoring and  analysis, \nincluding forecasting and warning of extreme weather-related events. The DWR constructs and \nmaintains  the  main  canals  of  the  irrigation  systems,  including  associated  flood  management \ninfrastructure.  Irrigation  infrastructure  management  is  coordinated  with  the  local  water  users \nassociations  (WUAs),  which  construct  and  maintain  the  lower-level  (on-farm  and  inter-farm) \ncanals. \n \n6. \nWater resources management and DRM are afforded high government priority. However, \nfollowing  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Kyrgyz  water  resources  infrastructure  has  become \ndilapidated  and  inefficient,  offering  insufficient  protection  and  resilience  to  natural  hazards.7 \nIrrigation infrastructure design and management is often suboptimal, with inadequate investment \nand maintenance by the DWR and WUAs. As a result, systems often do not have enough water \nfor  the  cropped  area  and  have  sustainable  but  low-productivity  operations  with  significant \nopportunity  for  improvement.  The  capacity  of  WUAs  is  highly  variable,  and  WUAs  often  have \ninsufficient and inequitable stakeholder representation, particularly of women, in decision-making \nprocesses.  Female  farmers  contribute  significantly  to  cultivating  activities  but  are  at  a \ndisadvantage when accessing financial markets and agricultural value chains because of social \nand  knowledge  barriers.  Community  consultation  has  identified  strong  demand  and  need  for \ninvestments in lower-level canal infrastructure, and improved integration with modernized primary \nand secondary canals. The MOES has insufficient equipment to fully undertake its planned annual \ndisaster prevention and rehabilitation (including recovery) works, and lack of recent investment \nmeans  the  equipment  is  used  beyond  its  economic  lifetime,  thereby  reducing  efficiency. \nKyrgyzHydromet  is  hampered  by  a  sparse  monitoring  network  and  insufficient  forecasting \ncapacity. This overall situation is likely to be aggravated by growing and competing water demand \nfrom  population  and  economic  growth  and  increased  demands  from  agriculture,  households, \nindustry, and the energy sector. \n \n7. \nGovernment sector strategy. The project is a priority climate adaptation project in the \nKyrgyz Climate Investment Programme.8 Strengthening resilience to climate change and extreme \nweather  events  in  water  resources  management  is  underpinned  by  the  country\u2019s  Water  Code \n(2005) and the government\u2019s national development, climate change, and sector strategies. The \nWater  Code is  the  primary  water-related  legal  act  and  is  based  on  the principles of  integrated \nwater resources management, organization of water resources management by river basin, and \nuser participation in decision making. The national development program for 2018\u20132022 includes \nproactive management of disaster and climate change risks, and prioritizes the construction and \nrehabilitation  of  irrigation  infrastructure  with  improved  water  efficiency.9  The  Strategy  for  the \nComprehensive  Protection  of  the  Population  and  the  Territory  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  from \nEmergency  Situations  for  2018\u20132030  seeks  to  reduce  disaster  losses  through,  among  other \nmeasures, improved monitoring, forecasting, and construction of protective structures that require \nabout Som9.8 billion in funding for 2018\u20132022.10 The State Programme on the Development of \nIrrigation of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2017\u20132026 seeks more productive use of water resources \nthrough  the  construction  and  modernization  of  infrastructure  and  the  introduction  of  improved \ntechnologies, which require about Som59 billion in funding.11 \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

The project was initially identified and elaborated \nunder  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  regional  technical  assistance  through  stakeholder \nconsultations  on  investment  needs  for  climate  change  and  disaster  resilience  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic (footnote 6). To mitigate future climate change and disaster impacts on the livelihoods \nof  vulnerable  communities,  these  consultations  identified  that  (i)  water  access  and  availability \nshould  be  made  more  resilient  to  future  disruptions,  variability,  and  change;  (ii)  resilience  to \nextreme weather events should be improved; and (iii) institutional capacity for climate and disaster \nrisk  management  and  response  should  be  strengthened.  An  earlier  ADB  regional  technical \nassistance undertook a detailed assessment of the agricultural and water resources sector in the \ncountry and identified priority investment needs for irrigation infrastructure.12 The ADB Agricultural \nArea  Development  Project,  completed  in  2009  and  rated  successful,  improved  agricultural \nmanagement,  rehabilitated  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  supported  business  development.13 \nLessons from ADB activities in the country and region call for (i) incorporating climate change and \ndisaster risk assessment into infrastructure design; (ii) optimizing water resources use through a \nmore  inclusive  and  gender-sensitive  participatory  planning  and  management  process;  and (iii) \nsupporting  infrastructure  investment  with  improved  capacity  for  water  resources  monitoring, \nforecasting, and warning of extreme events. \n \n9. \nDevelopment  partners  support  climate  resilience  and  DRM  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nincluding  the  water  resources  sector,  through  investment  projects  and  technical  assistance.14 \nDuring project preparation, ADB worked closely with development partners, including through the \nKyrgyz Republic Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Climate Investment Funds, \nto ensure appropriate coordination on project activities, avoid overlap of investments and target \nareas,  and  incorporate  lessons  from  earlier  and  ongoing  projects.  The  World  Bank  supports \n(i) capacity building and equipment modernization of KyrgyzHydromet for improved weather data \ncollection  and \nthe  Central  Asian  Hydromet  Modernization  Project, \n(ii) strengthening  of  WUAs  and  water  resources  data  management  under  the  National  Water \nResources  Management  Project  (Phase  1),  and  (iii)  on-farm  irrigation  infrastructure  and \nmanagement  under  the  Agriculture  Productivity  and  Nutrition  Improvement  Project.  United \nNations agencies and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe support climate \nresilience  and  transboundary  water  resources  management  in  the  Chu-Talas  Basin  through \nseveral projects. The United Nations Development Programme is preparing in parallel a mudflow \nprotection and forecasting project. However, the country has large investment needs, particularly \nfor irrigation infrastructure and equipment for sustainable and effective DRM capacity. \n \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project draws from the ADB Irrigation Subsector \n10. \nGuidance  Note  (2017)  to  emphasize  irrigation  modernization  over  simple  rehabilitation  and \ntargets optimized and resilient agricultural production as well as improved water productivity.15 To \nensure more productive and sustainable long-term outcomes, the project will take an inclusive \nparticipatory approach to irrigation subproject implementation with government and community \nstakeholders  jointly  engaged  in  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  subsequent  system \nmanagement. The project will incorporate elements of high-level technologies by pilot testing a \nnew hydrological monitoring and forecasting system for the Kyrgyz Republic using satellite data. \nThe  sector  lending  modality  is  appropriate  for  this  project  to  support  the  government\u2019s  sector \ndevelopment  plans;16  the  government  has  adequate  capacity  to  implement  the  plans,  but  the \n\nforecasting  under \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2013.

The  project  will  (i)  design  and  build  climate  change  and  disaster-resilient  irrigation \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  strengthen  irrigation  management  arrangements,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M), between the WUAs and the local DWR offices; (iii) enhance and strengthen \nWUAs and WUA subgroups; and (iv) build executing agencies\u2019 capacity on procurement, financial \nmanagement, and environmental and social safeguards. The project establishes a template for \nclimate change and disaster-resilient investment that may be scaled up and replicated. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  losses  in  the  agriculture  and  water \nresources  sectors  from  extreme  weather  events  reduced.17  The  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome: climate change and disaster resilience of infrastructure and water security improved.18 \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Irrigation infrastructure protected and modernized. The project will protect \n12. \nand  modernize  irrigation  systems  to  improve  the  productivity  and  disaster  resilience  of  about \n20,000  hectares  of  irrigated  land.  It  will  upgrade  and  construct  main  (primary  and  secondary) \ncanals;  lower-level  (inter-farm  and  on-farm)  canals;  and  associated  infrastructure  such  as \nprotective  mudflow  crossing  structures,  cross-regulators,  and  offtakes.19  Infrastructure  design \nspecifications will incorporate disaster risk mitigation measures for future climate conditions. The \nproject will mobilize a participatory planning and design process involving the DWR, WUAs, WUA \nsubgroups,  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  ensure  equitable  and  sustainable  outcomes.  One \nrepresentative subproject has been selected and developed during project preparation and two \nor  three  additional  subprojects  will  be  identified  for  investment  during  implementation.20 \nCommunity-based  contracting  will  be  pilot  tested  for  lower-level  canal  modernization  in  the \nrepresentative subproject and will be expanded to further subprojects if shown to be successful. \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Irrigation system and agricultural land management enhanced. The project \nwill strengthen management and O&M of target irrigation systems, including practical drought and \nclimate risk management, to ensure the sustainability of the investment benefits. In conjunction \nwith  output  1,  under  the  participatory  planning  process,  the  project  will  (i)  reorganize  and \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of WUAs and WUA subgroups for more effective organization; \nand (ii) build the capacity of the DWR representatives, WUA and WUA subgroup representatives, \nand farmers on effective and resilient irrigation system management, water use, and agronomy. \nThe project will develop  and implement joint DWR\u2013WUA irrigation system management plans, \nincluding  water  delivery  scheduling  and  O&M  financing  and  planning.  WUA  on-farm  water \nmanagement  and  agricultural  management  plans  with  gender  elements  will  be  developed, \nincluding  irrigation  scheduling,  cropping  patterns,  and  cultural  methods,  and  will  be  supported \nwith  capacity  building  for  farmers  and  community  members  (including  women),  such  as \ncomparative field trials and farmer field days. \n \n\n                                                \n17 Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  2015.

A feasibility study has been undertaken for \na  representative  subproject  that  considered  future  water  availability  and  flood  risks,  which \nprovides  the  basis  for  the  additional  subprojects.  The  participatory  planning,  design,  and \nmanagement  process  under  outputs  1  and  2  will  facilitate  a  more  engaged  decision-making \nprocess among stakeholders for optimal use of water resources. Sustainable management plans \nfor infrastructure and equipment will be developed under outputs 2 and 3 to ensure best practice \nasset management and O&M of project investments. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  be  economically  viable  and  sustainable.  The  representative \nsubproject is estimated to have an economic internal rate of return of 16%. The monetized benefit \nis improved farmer income from optimal agricultural production that is more resilient to climate \nchange and disaster risk. The nonquantifiable benefits include protection of the wider population \nfrom avoided impacts of flood damage through the improved and expanded preventive works and \nenhanced flood forecasting. The risks to the sustainability of the investments, particularly irrigation \nschemes, are mitigated through the development and implementation under outputs 2 and 3 of \nsustainable O&M plans, including institutional arrangements, financing, and cost sharing. To be \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\neligible  to  participate  in the  project  and  benefit  from  investments, WUAs  and WUA  subgroups \nmust demonstrate financial sustainability and undergo financial management training. ADB has \nsecured government assurance that adequate finance will be provided to meet its share of O&M \ncosts to implement these plans. Within the framework of the project, ADB will engage in broader \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  government  and  other  development  partners  on  ensuring  adequate \nfinancing of irrigation and DRM assets. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nThe  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial  because  the  executing \nagencies  (i)  have  limited  experience  in  ADB  policies  and  requirements  for  project  financial \nmanagement and (ii) generally do not apply international standards for accounting and internal \nand external audit. The risks will be mitigated through the (i) establishment of a PIU with a qualified \nchief  accountant  and  a  financial  specialist;  (ii)  establishment  of  a  PIU  financial  management \nsystem, including the use of commercial accounting software by the PIU; (iii) provision of on-the-\njob  support  and  training  to  the  PIU  by  a  project  implementation  consultant;  and  (iv)  annual \nmanagement audits of the PIU by an external firm on procurement processes, payment processes \nand systems (including bank reconciliation), and fixed-asset management. \n \n23. \nThe pre-mitigation procurement risk is substantial because the executing agencies have \n(i) limited experience in ADB procurement policies and requirements and (ii) insufficient internal \nsystems  in  place  for  governance  on  procurement.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  the \n(i) establishment  of  a  PIU  with  qualified  procurement  specialists,  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nprocurement management system in the PIU, (iii) provision of on-the-job support and training to \nthe PIU by a project implementation consultant, (iv) annual PIU management audits, and (v) use \nof prior review procedures. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  DWR,  and  the  MOES.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  vulnerability  of  the  lower-income  population  engaged  in  agriculture  is  a  result  of \nseveral  factors,  including  small  farm  lots,  limited  access  to  finance,  inefficient  practices  and \ntechnologies,  and  dilapidated  infrastructure.  The  project  is  expected  to  help  alleviate  these \nchallenges by providing climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure, improving institutional DRM, and \nimproving agricultural and water management. These will mitigate the negative effects of extreme \nweather events on properties and livelihoods. \n \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming as it addresses the gender issues \n26. \nrelevant  to  the  project,  such  as  (i)  women\u2019s  participation  in  WUAs  and  WUA  subgroups,  (ii) \ngender-sensitive  plans  for  improved  irrigation  and  agricultural  management,  and  (iii)  women\u2019s \nparticipation in training.27 \n \nE. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows.28 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB.

A draft initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), has been prepared by the executing agencies for the \nrepresentative subproject and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Additional subprojects will be selected \nduring project implementation and an environmental assessment and review framework has been \nprepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The executing agencies will rule out civil works and \nsubprojects with significant environmental impacts (only category B and C will be eligible), and an \nIEE  will  be  performed  for  each  subproject.  An  EMP  will  provide  appropriate  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures  and  a  capacity  building  plan  for  each  subproject;  contractors  will  be \nresponsible for  implementing the mitigation  measures.  Project  impacts  during  construction are \nexpected  to  be  site-specific  and  temporary  and  related  to  the  construction  of  the  subproject \ncomponents. Potential impacts during the operation phase are related to limited local capacity to \nmaintain  the  functionality  of  the  components,  with  expected  positive  impacts  from  the \nrehabilitation works. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement (category  B).  A  draft  land acquisition  and  resettlement  plan \n(LARP)  has  been  prepared  by  the  executing  agencies  for  the  representative  subproject  and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Additional subprojects will be selected during project implementation \nand a land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. The executing agencies will rule out category A civil works and subprojects, avoid land \nacquisition, and minimize resettlement impacts. Appropriate social safeguard documents will be \nprepared,  approved,  and  fully  implemented  before  any  works  commence.29  Surveys  and \nconsultation carried out during preparation for the representative subproject identified two affected \nhouseholds  with  12  household  members.30  No  land  acquisition  is  required,  and  resettlement \ncompensation  for  the  affected  assets  was  calculated  and  budgeted  as  part  of  the  draft  LARP \npreparation. No household will experience severe impacts or belongs to vulnerable groups. \n \n30. \nThe PIU will recruit a full-time safeguards specialist who will receive on-the-job training \nand  support  from  the  project  implementation  consultant  on  monitoring  the  EMP  and  LARP \nimplementation during construction. A grievance redress mechanism will be established by the \nPIU  following  the  LARP,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework,  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework, and the IEE and EMP to assist affected persons in resolving \ngrievances and complaints.
