All road, coastal, and water supply \nsubprojects  will  require  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE);  all \nother  subprojects  will  be  required \nto  complete  and  satisfy  an \nenvironmental  checklist  during  formulation.  Category  A  subprojects  will \nnot be financed. \n \n\nthe \n\ntsunami \n\nfollowing \n\n \nProject Description  Two  projects  are  presented  together  for  Board  consideration.  The \nTsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  contributes  to  the \nin \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  rebuilding  efforts \nDecember 2004. Post-tsunami efforts will focus on rebuilding roads and \nother  coastal-belt  community \ninfrastructure  and  shelter,  restoring \nlivelihoods, providing coastline protection damaged by the tsunami; and \nfacilitating law and governance measures and safeguards.  \n \nThe  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  II \n(NECORD-II),  programmed  for  2005,  continues  the  Government\u2019s \nrehabilitation program for the conflict-affected areas of the Northern and \nEastern provinces. Post-conflict rehabilitation will address basic needs in \nthe  conflict-affected  areas \nirrigation, \nagriculture,  community  development,  institutional  infrastructure,  and \nincome-generation subprojects.  \n \nOn 26 December 2004, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Sumatra sent \nseveral  tsunami  waves  that  struck  over  two  thirds  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \ncoastline and caused catastrophic destruction; more than 31,000 people \nin Sri Lanka died and thousands more are still missing. Another 440,000 \npeople are displaced, with the tsunami-affected population estimated at \nbetween 1 and 2 million, out of a total population of about 19 million.  \n \n\nthrough  health,  education, \n\n \nRationale \n\n\fNearly 100,000 houses were destroyed during the tsunami and another \n46,000 were damaged. Infrastructure and fishing industry assets such as \nboats were damaged or lost. About 60% of the damage occurred on the \neast and northeast coasts.  \n \nA joint tsunami needs assessment, in cooperation with the Government \nand the Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation, was undertaken by ADB, \nthe  World  Bank,  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  in \nconcert  with  United  Nations  agencies.  Tsunami-related  financing  needs \nfor rebuilding are estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion. In the short \nterm, the majority of resources are required for housing, transportation, \ninstitutional  and  community  infrastructure,  livelihood  restoration  for \nfishermen  and  small-scale  farmers,  and  small  and  micro-enterprise \nassistance.  \n \nThe  coastal  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  have  only \nrecently begun to emerge from the devastating effects of nearly 20 years \nof civil conflict when the tsunami hit. The conflict left over 65,000 dead, \nseveral  times  as  many  people  disabled,  and  nearly  800,000  people \ndisplaced  from  their  homes.  A  large  percentage  of  people  directly \naffected by the conflict still suffer from a lack of basic infrastructure and \nsocial services. A cease-fire agreement signed by the Government and \nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 3 years before the tsunami hit had \nenabled  a  period  of  reconciliation  and  restoration  in  the  North  East. \nHowever, many villages and much of the coastal infrastructure that had \nbeen  rebuilt  after  the  cease-fire  were  destroyed  by  the  tsunami.  Many \nother assets that had withstood the conflict were lost in the tsunami.  \n \nAfter  the  cease-fire,  a  comprehensive  conflict  needs  assessment  was \npresented \nthe  Sri  Lanka \nReconstruction  and  Development  Conference  held  in  Tokyo  in  June \n2003.  The  needs  assessment  estimated  that  about  $3 billion  would  be \nrequired  for  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction.  Of  this  $2  billion, \nabout  $780  million  was  identified  for  immediate  needs,  and  about  $1.2 \nbillion  was  identified  for  medium-term  needs.  To  date,  the  international \ncommunity  has  committed  about  $700 million\u2013\u2013to  address  both \nimmediate  and  medium-term  needs.  This  leaves  at  least  $80  million  of \nthe immediate needs unmet.  \n \n\ninternational  community  at \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nTAARP  \nObjectives and \nScope \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  pre-tsunami  conditions  and  the  situation  in  the  North  East  make  it \ndifficult to demarcate tsunami- and conflict-related rebuilding efforts. The \ntsunami  needs  assessment  emphasized  the  importance  of  key  guiding \nprinciples\u2014such  as  conflict  sensitivity,  subsidiarity,  community \nrisk  management,  and \ntransparency,  multi-hazard \nempowerment, \ncoordination  between  stakeholders\u2014during \nthe  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  recovery  strategy.  The  international  community  has \nresponded  generously  with  pledges  of  tsunami  assistance.  However, \nprovision  of  significant  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  people  may \nproduce  tensions  if  it  is  perceived  that  different  parts  of  the  country  or \nethnic  groups  are  receiving  more  than  their  fair  share  of  reconstruction \nfunds, or if other people who are in poverty, or internally displaced from \nthe conflict, feel they are being forgotten. By providing assistance at the \nsame  time  and  with  a  similar  delivery  framework  and  policies  to  both \ntsunami- and conflict-affected areas, the risk of creating a perception of \nunequal  treatment  of  people  affected  by  either  calamity  will  be \nminimized.  \n \nRecognizing the urgent needs and the social services and infrastructure \nlost  as  a  result  of  the  tsunami  and  the  20-year  conflict,  both  projects \nhave been processed under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy.  TAARP  will  complement  and  augment  other  projects  in  the \ntsunami-affected  areas,  benefiting \nthe  current  extensive \ncoordination  mechanisms  established  among  external  parties. \nNECORD-II also coordinates well with other projects planned or ongoing \nin the North East and will reinforce the perception that the international \ncommunity remains involved with and supports the peace process.  The \nProject  will  also  confirm  ADB\u2019s  leading  role  in  rehabilitation  and  peace \nbuilding  operations  in  the  North  East,  the  country\u2019s  most  impoverished \nand vulnerable region, which was also hit particularly hard by the effects \nof the tsunami.  \n \nThe  objective  of  TAARP  is  to  rapidly  improve  the  living  conditions  and \nwell-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  the  tsunami-affected \nareas  by  restoring  basic  social  infrastructure,  community  and  public \nservices,  and  livelihoods.  TAARP  will  address  the  needs  of  tsunami-\naffected  people  through  numerous  subprojects  in  a  variety  of  sectors \nselected  and  formulated  in  response  to  requests  from  tsunami-affected \npeople and the Government. Other subprojects will be designed as part \nof  the  restoration  and  expansion  of  ongoing  ADB  interventions  in  order \nfurther  environmental \nto  address \nprotection. Governance, anti-corruption and legal empowerment are also \naddressed.  \n \n\ntsunami  damage  and  provide \n\nfrom \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nTAARP  \nCost Estimates \n \nTAARP  \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nNECORD-II  \nObjectives and \nScope \n\n \nNECORD-II  \nCost Estimates \n\ncoastal \n\nrehabilitation,  North  East \n\nTAARP  focuses  on  the  highest  priority  sectors  in  the  tsunami-affected \nareas  for  which  ADB  assistance  is  most  appropriate,  based  on  the \ntsunami  needs  assessments  and  reflecting  consultations  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  stakeholders.  TAARP  components  include  road \ncommunity \nrebuilding  and \ndevelopment, \nlivelihood  restoration,  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nSouthern  Province  reconstruction,  coastal  resources  protection,  and \nNorth East community restoration and development. A legal assistance, \ngovernance,  and  anticorruption  component  will  help  the  Government \nand  tsunami-affected  people  to  resolve  legal  and  documentary  issues, \nsuch  as  replacing  lost  identification  cards,  titles,  and  certificates.  This \ncomponent  will  also  help  the  Government  to  confront  the  risk  of  an \nincrease  in  corruption  that  may  follow  the  influx  of  foreign  assistance \nfollowing  the  tsunami  and  will  support  decentralized  dispute  resolution \nfor tsunami victims.  \n \nThe estimated total cost is $249.3 million equivalent, inclusive of taxes, \nduties, and interest during implementation.  \n \n\n \nSource \n\nAsian Tsunami Fund Grant \nAsian Development Fund Loan \u2013  \n         Portfolio Reallocation  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n0.3 \n\n \n\n6.7 \n\n($ million) \n\n \nTotal a \n150.0 \n\n \n% \n\n60.2 \n\n7.0 \n\n2.8 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Sri Lanka \nEuropean Commission \n\n157.0 \n39.1 \n53.2 \n249.3 \na  Grant  financing  does  not  distinguish  between  foreign  exchange  and  local \n\n \n40.9 \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n0.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n63.0 \n15.7 \n21.3 \n100.0 \n\ncurrency.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nThe  main  objective  of  NECORD-II  is  rapidly  to  improve  the  living \nconditions  and  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  the \nconflict-affected  areas  of  the  North  East  by  restoring  basic  social \nlivelihoods. \ninfrastructure,  community  and  public  services,  and \nNECORD-II will also support and augment Sri Lanka\u2019s rehabilitation and \nrelief efforts underway in the conflict-affected areas.  \n \ncommunity \nNECORD-II \ndevelopment, \ninstitutional \ninfrastructure and restore basic infrastructure.

The  loans  will  have  a  40-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% \nper  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  a  year \nthereafter. The terms and conditions of the grants will be as set forth in \nthe Financing and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 for both projects \n \n \nBoth  projects  will  be  implemented  through  project  management  units \n(PMUs)  already  established  under  other  ongoing  loans  in  the  portfolio, \nexcept  for  the  governance  component.  Each  PMU  will  address  a  need \naccording  to  its  present  strength  and  area  of  coverage.  The  PMUs  will \ngenerally  be  responsible  to  different  executing  agencies,  according  to \nthe existing arrangements of their parent loan projects.  \n \nA  National  Project  Coordination  Committee  chaired  by  the  Secretary, \nMinistry of Finance and Planning, will be established to provide oversight \nand coordination. Members will come from the Task Force for Rebuilding \nthe  Nation,  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Judicial  Affairs,  the  Ministry  of \nDefense,  other  ministries,  departments,  and  agencies  responsible  for \ntsunami--related  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  ADB; \nthe  chief \nsecretaries  of  the  Southern  and  North  East  Provincial  Councils;  ADB \nproject directors; and others as appropriate. The committee will meet at \nleast  quarterly  and  oversee  overall  project  coordination  and \nimplementation at the national level.  \n \nTo  ensure  beneficiary  participation  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation,  sector  subprojects  will  generally  be  prepared  for  and \napproved by a provincial project coordination committee. The North East \nProvincial  Council  currently  performs  this  function  very  effectively  for \nADB  projects  in  the  North  East.  Consultants  funded  by  technical \nassistance  will  help  to  adopt  this  system  in  the  Southern  Provincial \nCouncil.  \n \n\n\fin  accounting, \n\nThe  increased  demand  for  tsunami  rebuilding  requires  that  each  PMU \nbe  strengthened \nto \nif  necessary,  particularly \naccommodate the additional workload. Where a considerable amount of \ninfrastructure work is needed, engineers will be added.  \n \nProcurement  under  both  projects  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. For civil works contracts with estimated \nvalues  greater  than  $5 million,  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  with \nestimated  values  of  $5 million  and  below,  procurement  will  be  in \naccordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB,  using  single-stage,  two-envelope  procedures  where  relevant,  and \nbidding  periods  of  at  least  21  days.  For  tsunami-related  procurement, \nlocal competitive bidding periods can be reduced to 15 days.  \n \ninternational \nEquipment  and  materials  will  be  procured \ncompetitive  bidding  when  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent,  through  international  shopping  when  the  estimated  cost  is \nbetween  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and \nlocal \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB when the estimated cost is \n$300,000  equivalent  or \nthan  $100,000 \nequivalent may be directly purchased.  \n \nMost  of  the  investments  to  be  supported  by  TAARP  are  expected  to \ncome  from  within  Sri  Lanka  or  to  involve  some  procurement  from  ADB \nmember  countries.  However,  to  facilitate  the  European  Commission\u2019s \ncofinance  of  \u20ac40  million  proposed  under  the  road  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction component, Board approval is now being sought to allow \nprocurement  in,  and  procurement  of  eligible  goods  and  services  from, \nmember  countries  of  the  European  Union,  including  ADB  non-member \ncountries.  This  would  facilitate  maximum  and  expeditious  development \nand  catalyze  additional  resources  from  development  partners  in  the \ncurrent post-tsunami emergency circumstance.  \n \n \n\nItems  costing \n\nthrough \n\nthrough \n\nless. \n\nless \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fConsulting \nServices \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nfor \n\nfor \n\nto  ADB \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  that  consultants  for  tsunami-related \nservices be engaged by ADB, in consultation with the Government, and \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nthe  engagement  of \nother  arrangements  satisfactory \nthe  road \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.  Consultants \nrehabilitation  and  rebuilding  component  will  be  selected  from  existing \nconsultant design firms already engaged in ongoing road sector projects \nin  Sri  Lanka,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance,  based  on  bio-data \nproposals  and  using  the  quality  and  cost  based  method  of  selection. \nConsulting  design  services  required  for  all  remaining  tsunami-related \ncomponents  will  be  engaged  through  direct  selection,  typically  through \nan extension of an existing contract. The consultants for NECORD who \nare  currently  providing  procurement  and  contract  management  support \nand  training  of  domestic  agencies  will  extend  their  services  through \ndirect  selection  to  cover  the  additional  requirements  of  the  NECORD-\nTsunami  and  NECORD-II  components.  Consultants  to  be  placed  within \nPMUs will be hired as individuals. TAARP will require approximately 115 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  881  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  NECORD-II  will  require \napproximately 200 person-months of domestic consulting services.  \n \n \n31 December 2008 for both projects \n\n \nThe  vast  majority  of  those  directly  affected  by  the  tsunami  were  at  the \nlower  end  of  the  economic  scale,  partly  because  the  districts  affected \ntended  to  have  high  levels  of  poverty  at  the  time  of  the  disaster  and \npartly because people who lived in substandard housing were less able \nto resist the onslaught of the waves.  \n \nIn  the  conflict-affected  North  East,  poverty  levels  are  estimated  to  be \n60%\u201390%,  much  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  although  there \nare gaps in government surveys for much of the area.  \n \nTogether,  the  two  projects  will  address  urgent  needs  of  approximately \n3 million people, among whom the physically disabled, single heads-of-\nhouseholds,  and  children  feature  significantly.  By  restoring  sectors  that \nform  the  backbone  of  the  economy  in  affected  areas,  the  projects  will \nhelp to rebuild communities and stabilize the economic base of the local \npopulations,  helping  them  to  move  from  dependency  on  government \nsupport towards sustainable livelihoods.  \n \nProactive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs \nin  NECORD-II  will  be \nundertaken  in  the  rapidly-expanding  construction  industry  in  the  North \nEast.  Programs  in  NECORD-II  will  also  support  gender  enterprise \ninitiatives  in  the  North  East  to  address  the  needs  of  the  many  conflict \nwidows,  reduce  their  dependency  on  government  support,  and  secure \nsustainable livelihoods for them.  \n \n\n\fviii \n\nAssumptions, \nRisks and \nMitigants \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe  designs  of  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  incorporate  safeguards  to \nimprove and strengthen governance and the institutional capacity of the \nexecuting agencies, the implementing agencies, and the PMUs.  \n \nA  possible  increase  in  social  tensions  and  conflict  among  the  major \nethnic groups in the tsunami- and conflict-affected areas is a major risk. \nSuch an increase in tensions and violence could come about as a result \nimplementation  of \nof  unbalanced \ntargeting,  and  undermining \nto \nreconstruction.  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  have  been  designed \nminimize  this  risk  and  will  be  implemented  so  that  balances  among \nethnic  groups  and  regions  within  all  the  affected  areas  are  carefully \nmonitored  and  managed.  There  will  be  transparency  and  community \nownership  of  project  activities.  Both  projects  can  potentially  make  a \npositive  contribution  to  rebuilding  key  infrastructure  and  make  existing \ninfrastructure more effective in strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of \nthe tsunami- and conflict-affected areas.  \n \nIn responding to the tsunami, Sri Lanka\u2019s financial and human capacities \nare  being  strained.  The  volume  and  scale  of  tsunami-related  foreign \nassistance  being  provided  to  Sri  Lanka  could  lead  to  governance  and \ncorruption  problems  and  weaknesses  in  the  administration  of  justice. \nThe size of public and private contributions to Sri Lanka may exceed the \ncurrent  capacity  of  the  Government\u2019s  public  administration  to  manage \nthe \nfor \nprocurement,  financial  management,  environmental  assessment,  and \nresettlement, supervision and monitoring has been assessed and will be \nfurther  enhanced  through  TAARP.  Other  factors  designed  to  mitigate \ngovernance  and  corruption  risks  include:  legal  assistance,  detailed \nsubproject selection criteria, transparent implementation and monitoring \nmechanisms, specific financial controls, and regular and random audits. \nADB\u2019s  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission  is  also  strengthening  its  capacity  to \nsupervise  and  provide  guidance  and  training  to  PMUs.  A  decentralized \nsystem of dispute resolution and grievance review will be established or \nstrengthened  under  TAARP  to  investigate  and  resolve  any  private \ndisputes  or  claims  of  impropriety  against  public  officials  relating  to \ntsunami  assistance.  The  public  will  be  provided  with  information  to \nensure that tsunami-assistance funds are used for intended beneficiaries \nand  purposes  by  publishing  such  information  on  a  web-site  and  in \nSinhala, Tamil and English in government newspapers. \n \nFinally,  reflecting  the  links  between  assistance  in  the  North  East  and \nprogress in the peace process, there is a risk that, if the peace process \nfalters,  NECORD-II\u2019s  scope  and  schedule  may  need  to  be  reviewed. \nDespite \nthe \ncommitment to peace remains robust, the peace process remains intact, \nand the cease-fire agreed to in 2002 continues to be observed\u2014this risk \nis therefore assessed to be small.  \n\nrecent  political  and  other  uncertainties,  however, \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  capacity \n\nfunds.

A  design  and  monitoring \nframework is presented in Appendix 1a and 1b, respectively, for each proposed project.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nTsunami Impact and Needs Assessment \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn the morning of Sunday 26 December 2004, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off Sumatra \nsent  several  tsunami  waves  radiating  out  into  the  Bay  of  Bengal,  the  Andaman  Sea,  and  the \nIndian  Ocean.  These  waves  struck  over  two  thirds  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  coastline1  and  caused \ncatastrophic destruction and considerable loss of life (see map).  \n \nAs of February 2005, official figures indicated that over 31,000 people in Sri Lanka lost \n3. \ntheir  lives  in  the  tsunami,  thousands  more  remain  missing,  and  over  440,000  were  displaced. \nThe tsunami-affected population is between 1 and 2 million people, out of a total population of \nabout 19 million.  \n \n4. \nIn the wake of the disaster, the Government, as part of its reconstruction plan to address \ntsunami  damage,  launched  a  needs  assessment  and,  within  days,  prepared  an  inventory  of \ndamage and losses. Three task forces were assembled to address the disaster, with the Task \nForce  for  Rebuilding  the  Nation  (TAFREN),  assigned  to  address  reconstruction  needs.  At  a \nmeeting  in  late  December  2004,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC), in coordination with the United Nations (UN), assisted the Government to \ndevelop  a  coastal  area  reconstruction  needs  assessment  to  serve  as  a  platform  for  all \ndevelopment partners interested in contributing to this effort.  \n \n5. \nThe  first  phase  of  the  needs  assessment,  conducted  with  technical  assistance  from \nADB,2  began  in  early  January  2005.  The  damage  caused  by  the  tsunami  was  surveyed  and \nestimates  of  the  financing  requirements  for  post-tsunami  construction  were  refined.  Weekly \nmeetings  were  held  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  UN  organizations,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and civil society. A preliminary report was presented on 28 January 2005 \n(Appendix 2 contains a summary of the needs assessment findings).  \n \n6. \nTsunami-related  financing  needs  for  national  rebuilding  are  estimated  to  be  over \n$1.5 billion,  in  addition  to  the  $200  million-$300 million  that  the  Government  estimates  it  has \nalready spent, and excluding further relief expenditures. The fiscal impact of the tsunami will be \nmore  long  term,  given  that  estimated  rebuilding  costs  will  be  the  equivalent  of  almost  7%  of \nannual gross domestic product.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Colombo  and  the  10  districts  of  Kalutara,  Galle,  Matara,  Hambantota,  Ampara,  Batticaloa,  Trincomalee, \n\nKilinochchi, Mullaittivu, and Jaffna were most significantly affected by the tsunami.  \n\n2   ADB.  2005.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n \n\nThe  Government  estimates  that  nearly  100,000 houses  were  destroyed  during  the \n7. \ntsunami and another 46,000 were damaged. Nearly 170 public schools, 4 universities, and 18 \nvocational and training centers were affected. The health sector suffered not only from damage \nto health-related infrastructure, but also through loss of services and human resources. Coastal \ncourts  and  labor  tribunals,  prisons,  and  police  stations,  and  district  offices  that  contained \npersonal and property documents were partially or completely destroyed.  \n \n8. \nAbout 1,400 kms of the national and provincial road network, and another 1,100 kms of \nlocal  and  village  access  roads  were  damaged.  Bridges  and  culverts  were  also  destroyed  or \ndisplaced  and  embankments  were  eroded  by  the  advancing  and  retreating  tsunami.  Flooding \nbefore  and  after  the  tsunami  along  the  east  coast  further  damaged  the  road  network.  The \ntsunami  destroyed  several  sections of  coastal  railway  lines,  in  particular  on  the  Southern  Line \nbetween Colombo and Galle along the Southwest coast. Water supply schemes and distribution \nnetworks  along  the  shoreline  were  impacted,  along  with  at  least  12,000  water  wells  damaged \nmainly  by  saltwater  intrusion;  about  50,000  others  were  abandoned.  Salinity  contamination  of \nstand crops in paddy and other crop fields or home gardens will limit or inhibit crop production \nfor the next 3 to 4 years, until salinity is naturally flushed away through rain.  \n \n9. \nThe  damaged  sustained  to  coastal  livelihoods  ranges  from  destroyed  fishing  boats  to \ndamaged  informal  guesthouses,  through  the  loss  of  business  inventories  to  the  loss  of  simple \ntools  and  workshops.  About  65%  of  the  nation\u2019s  sea  fishing  boat  fleet  was  either  damaged  or \ndestroyed. About 3,500 hotel rooms out of about 14,000 rooms in medium to large-scale hotels \nare  not  in  operation.  In  the  small  guesthouses,  about  1,200  rooms  out  of  a  total  4,000  have \nbeen affected.  \n \n10. \nThe second phase of the tsunami needs assessment process started in February 2005 \nunder  the  supervision  of  a  steering  committee  made  up  of  many  stakeholders.3  The  main \nobjectives  of  phase  II  are:  (i)  to  finalize  the  damage  assessment  figures  by  consulting  with \nTAFREN  and  other  stakeholders  and  to  arrive  at  a  consensus  on  reconstruction  needs  and \nfinancing requirements; and (ii) to develop implementation strategies for responding equitably to \nthe  needs  of  the  tsunami-affected  communities  that  will  guide  all  parties  engaged  in  post-\ntsunami  reconstruction.  The  second  phase  will  involve  a  thorough  consultative  process \nconducted  in  districts  by  multisectoral  teams  drawn  from  TAFREN,  the  donor  community,  civil \nsociety, the private sector, and other stakeholders. These strategies will be completed by mid-\nApril 2005.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  coastal  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  had  only  recently  begun  to \nemerge  from  the  devastating  effects  of  the  nearly  20-year  civil  conflict  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) when the tsunami \nhit. The lengthy civil conflict left over 65,000 dead, several times as many people disabled, and \nnearly 800,000 people displaced from their homes. In February 2002, the Government and the \nLTTE  signed  a  cease-fire  agreement,  thereby  beginning  a  period  of  reconciliation,  restoration, \nand reconstruction. However, a large percentage of people directly affected by the conflict still \nlack basic infrastructure and social services.  \n \n\nConflict Impact and Needs Assessment \n\n                                                 \n3   The  Steering  Committee  includes  ADB,  JBIC,  United  Nations,  World  Bank,  and  representatives  of  bilateral  aid \nagencies,  civil  society,  and  the  private  sector.  The  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  were  consulted  on  the \nproposed initiatives, planning directions and document review.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nIn early 2003, multilateral agencies operating in Sri Lanka4 undertook a comprehensive \n12. \nassessment  of  reconstruction  needs  for  the  conflict-affected  areas,  primarily  in  the  eight \ndistricts5 that make up the North East (see map). The assessment, which was presented to the \ninternational community at the Sri Lanka Reconstruction and Development Conference held in \nTokyo  in  June  2003,6  identified  about  $2 billion  for  immediate  and  medium-term  needs,  and \n$1 billion  for  longer-term  needs.  Of  this  $2  billion,  about  $780  million  was  identified  for \nimmediate  needs,  and  about  $1.2  billion  was  identified  for  medium-term  needs.  To  date,  the \ninternational  community  has  committed  about  $700 million\u2013\u2013to  address  both  immediate  and \nmedium-term needs. This leaves at least $80 million of the immediate needs unmet.  \n \nC. \n \nThe tsunami needs assessment emphasized the importance of key guiding principles\u2014\n13. \nsuch  as  conflict  sensitivity,  subsidiarity,  community  empowerment,  transparency,  multi-hazard \nrisk  management,  and  coordination  between  stakeholders\u2014during  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  recovery  strategy.  The  guiding  principles,  which  have  been  agreed  by  all \nconcerned  parties,  are  presented  in  Appendix 3.  The  international  community  has  responded \ngenerously  with  pledges  of  tsunami  assistance.  However,  if  not  approached  and  delivered \nsensitively, the provision of this tsunami assistance could risk exacerbating preexisting tensions, \nby creating a perception of unequal treatment of people affected by the conflict.  \n \n14. \nIn addition to the problems and needs described above (paragraphs 6-9), the destruction \nwrought  by  the  tsunami  has  generated  legal  issues  for  tsunami-affected  people,  including  the \nloss of documents: titles to property; birth, death, and marriage certificates; identification cards; \ncourt  records;  and  bank  account  documents.  They  also  face  family,  custody,  adoption, \ninheritance, insurance, property rights and entitlement issues. The Department of the Registrar \nGeneral  (within  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  Law  and  Order)  is  attempting  to  reissue  birth, \ndeath and marriage certificates, and the Department of the Registration of Persons (within the \nMinistry  of  Public  Security,  Law  and  Order),  is  attempting  to  issue  identification  cards  to  all \ntsunami-affected  persons.  To  the  extent  copies  of  documents  remain,  record-keeping  and \nretrieval  in  these  departments  is  currently  manually  done,  making  it  almost  impossible  to \nrespond to some requests for replacement documents. Data collection from tsunami victims has \nlevel \nnot  been  coordinated  amongst  departments.  Additionally,  divisional  and  district \ngovernment officials (district secretaries, divisional secretaries, and grama niladhari7) will need \nto  understand  the  new  legal  requirements,  and  document  processing  procedures  and  to \nproceed  along  appropriate  channels.  They  will  need  legal  assistance  to  resolve  any  legal \nquestions that may arise. In the tsunami-affected areas, already poor and vulnerable people will \nhave  difficulty  negotiating  formal  avenues,  and  clearly  need  assistance  if  they  are  to  benefit \nfrom  the  new  laws  and  procedures.  In  addition,  the  legal  and  factual  issues  generated  by  the \ntsunami  are  likely  to  lead  to  increased  disputes  and  grievances,  both among  tsunami-affected \npeople, and possibly against government officers and departments. The volume and scale of all \ntsunami-assistance  provided  to  Sri  Lanka  could  also  lead  to  corruption.  Current  institutional \nstructures may not be sufficient.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  United Nations organizations, World Bank, and ADB.  \n5  Districts  of  Ampara,  Batticaloa,  Jaffna,  Kilinochchi,  Mannar,  Mullaittivu,  Trincomalee,  Vavuniya.  Of  these,  only \n\nMannar and Vavuniya were not significantly affected by the tsunami.  \n\n6  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  ADB,  United  Nations,  and  World  Bank.  2003.

Colombo. \n\n7 Grama Niladhari divisions or GN divisions, are the lowest level of administration within the Government. \n\n\fThe extent of debris, waste material, and rubble requiring disposal will lead to significant \n15. \ndisposal  costs.  The  dumping  of  debris  in  inappropriate  locations  must  be  addressed \nimmediately to prevent long-term problems of flood control, waterway blockages, contamination \nof the groundwater table, and pollution on beaches, for example by using debris as construction \nmaterial when possible.  \n \n16. \nBecause  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  vulnerability  to  global  warming,  climate  change,  sea  level  rise, \nand  extreme  weather  events,  the  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  are  currently  conducting  environmental  assessments  of  the  devastation \ncaused by the tsunami. Their objective is to identify follow-on projects and further studies in the \nlikelihood  of  similar  or  localized  natural  disasters  in  the  future,  including  the  role  of  natural \nresources in minimizing the effect of natural disasters. As a result of the assessment by UNEP \nand its partners, tsunami reconstruction subprojects need to identify ways to (i) respond to the \nvulnerability  of  coastal  populations  to  such  disasters;  (ii) prevent  or  reduce  the  magnitude  of \nsuch  disasters;  (iii) educate  coastal  populations  on  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation; \n(iv) improve  information  and  communication  systems;  and  (v) enhance  coastal  protection \nthrough  natural  barriers  such  as  green  zones  or  green  belts  of  forests,  coastal  vegetation,  or \nmangroves.  \n \n17. \nBoth  disasters  have  radically  transformed  gender  roles.  Women  face  the  burden  of \ncaring  and  providing  for  the  family,  while  contributing  to  community  life  in  welfare  centers  or \nrefugee  camps.  Conflict-related  disability,  often  of  males,  has  placed  additional  burdens  on \nwomen  and  other  family  members.  Family  and  household  structures  have  been  recast,  with \nmany families forming one household, households headed by one person (female and male), or \nfamilies composed of grandparents and grandchildren. The conflict left many widows who took \non the role of head of household, combining the traditional roles of breadwinner and caregiver. \nThe tsunami has reversed this trend and left a large number of households headed by men. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nADB has considerable experience in implementing emergency reconstruction through its \nongoing  projects  in  conflict-affected  areas.  These  projects  have  been  recognized  for  their \n(i) preparedness  to  respond  quickly  and  flexibly;  (ii) a  bottom-up  approach  to  subproject \nselection; (iii) balanced treatment of sectors, geographic areas, and ethnic groups; (iv) a focus \non  restoring  facilities;  (v) prompt  supervision  by  ADB  during  implementation,  as  the  projects \nplace  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  and  implementing  agency  staff;  (vi) rapid  action  by  the \nGovernment; and (vii) close donor coordination.  \n \nADB\u2019s  experience  has  yielded  the  following  lessons:  (i) participation  by  all  sections  of \n19. \naffected  communities, \nincluding  consultative  processes  and  social  mobilization,  needs \nassessments,  and  participatory  planning,  must  be  ensured  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation;  (ii) the  particular  needs  of  women,  households  headed  by  one  person,  the \nelderly,  and  the  disabled  must  be  addressed;  (iii) environmental  and  social  aspects  should  be \nconsidered  during  project  implementation,  even  though  the  need  for  rapid  response  may  not \npermit  detailed  treatment  of  these  issues  before  assistance is  approved;  (iv) arrangements  for \ndisbursements should give prompt and uncomplicated access to funds; (v) a focus on physical \ninfrastructure  alone  reduces  project  benefits,  so  broader  issues  of  assisting  communities  and \naffected  areas  to  regain  a  productive  life  must  be  addressed;  (vi) flexibility  should  be  shown \nduring  implementation;  (vii) there  should  be  simple  prioritization  in  subproject  selection  and \nshort implementation periods, but there must also be a balanced distribution of benefits among \ncommunities  and  affected  areas;  (viii) close  and  frequent  monitoring  is  needed  to  ensure \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n4 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy  \n\ntransparency  and  facilitate  implementation;  and  (ix) the  large  number  of  Government  and \nexternally-assisted rehabilitation programs in the affected areas must be properly coordinated at \nthe local level. These lessons, learned in the conflict-affected areas, will be relevant to tsunami-\naffected areas.  \n \nE. \n \nADB\u2019s  disaster  policy8  emphasizes  a  holistic  and  systematic  approach  to  disaster  and \n20. \nemergency  assistance  that  extends  beyond  mere  reconstruction  to  rehabilitation.  It  stresses \nstrengthening or rebuilding institutions, developing appropriate policies, and training. Strategies \nfor  short-term  rehabilitation  are  designed  to  lay  the  foundation  for  medium  and  long-term \ndevelopment.  The  disaster  policy  prioritizes  strengthening  of  partnerships  and  efficient  use  of \nresources.  In  light  of  the  need  for  an  expeditious  and  transparent  response,  it  also  calls  for \nextensive  participation  and  consultation,  and  measures  that  promote  transparency  and \naccountability,  such  as  increased  supervision  and  monitoring  and  special  audits.  It  advocates \nemergency  assistance  loans  to  provide  short-term  assistance  for  efforts  to  rehabilitate  priority \ninfrastructure,  revitalize social  services,  regenerate  livelihoods,  and  provide  transitional  safety-\nnet support.9  \n \n21. \nIn response to the special circumstances surrounding the developing member countries \n(DMCs)  affected  by  the  tsunami,  ADB  established  an  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  (ATF)10  to  channel \nresources from ADB and other donors to the affected DMCs. The ATF will channel emergency \ngrant financing promptly and effectively to tsunami-related reconstruction and rehabilitation and \nassociated development activities. The ATF will be used exclusively to restore services promptly \nto  affected  populations  in  the  tsunami-affected  DMCs  that  have  requested  ADB  assistance: \nIndia, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In a letter to ADB dated 17 February 2005, \nthe Government of Sri Lanka requested grant assistance to address its reconstruction needs as \na result of the tsunami disaster.  \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  update  for  Sri  Lanka,  2005\u20132006,11  supports  the \n22. \nGovernment's  efforts  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  conflict-affected  areas  through  the  North \nEast Community Restoration and Development Project II (NECORD-II). The Asian Development \nFund IX (ADF IX) replenishment includes a new grant program that, inter alia, can be used to \nassist  countries  recovering  from  conflict  as  they  make  the  transition  to  peace  and  stability. \nNECORD-II  was  programmed  to  receive  ADF  grant  funding  together  with  a  loan  for  use  in \nrehabilitation efforts in the conflict-affected North East.  \n \nThe pre-tsunami conditions in the North East make it difficult to demarcate tsunami- and \n23. \nconflict-related  rebuilding  efforts.  ADB  assistance \nfor  post-tsunami  reconstruction  and \nNECORD-II will therefore be implemented simultaneously. This has been done to (i) apply the \nsame  policies  and  standards  to  tsunami-  and  conflict-affected  people,  to  avoid  generating \nadditional tensions or perceptions of unequal treatment; (ii) coordinate reconstruction activities; \nand  (iii) link  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  needs.  The  projects  also  provide  a  systematic \napproach  to  the  conflict  in  the  North  East  and  the  tsunami  disaster  by  taking  a  decentralized \napproach  and  providing  for  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure,  as  well  as  coastal  vulnerability,  the \nrisk of corruption and weak governance, gender, and social issues.  \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n\nDonor Coordination \n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  and  to  maintain  clear  accountability,  two  separate \n24. \nfinancing agreements will be signed for the two projects, and separate accounts will be held for \nthe various activities and funding sources. With this project and accounting separation, tsunami \ngrant  funds  can  be  clearly  and  accurately  controlled  so  they  are  dedicated  solely  to  tsunami-\nrelated activities. Similarly, ADF IX grant funds will be used only for reconstruction efforts in the \nconflict-affected North East.  \n \nF. \n \n25. \nTAARP has been designed to be a part of a well-coordinated response to the disaster. \nThe tsunami needs assessment carried out in January 2005, which is consistent with the needs \nassessment prepared by the Government and other studies developed for districts in the North \nEast,12  was  used  to  determine  specific  interventions,  following  consultations  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  development  partners.  Given  the  many  expressions  of  interest  in \nsupporting reconstruction in education, health, power, temporary shelter, risk management, and \ncapacity building for future disasters, ADB has focused on roads, community infrastructure and \nshelter, restoring livelihoods, coastal protection, and governance. Within these sectors, ADB is \ncoordinating with its partners; for example, in the area of livelihood restoration, the World Bank \nis  supporting  cash  grants  and  \u201ccash  for  work\u201d  programs  in  cooperation  with  the  International \nLabour Organization, JBIC is providing a loan for the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises, and ADB has extended a microfinance and microcredit facility. In addition, as a co-\nchair of the needs assessment exercise, ADB has strongly promoted the adoption of common \nstandards  and  policies  that  all  external  development  partners  should  adopt  in  designing  their \ninterventions,  in  order  to  minimize  potential  for  conflict  and  social  tension.  The  role  of  the \nvarious partners in each sector is shown in Appendix 4.  \n \n26. \nSeparate  assistance  grants  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  are  being \nprocessed  to  provide  a  total  of  $4 million  to  Sri  Lanka  to  restore  and  create  line  drainage \nsystems along tsunami-affected roads and to provide microfinance opportunity for post-tsunami \nutility connections at newly-built or repaired houses. Outreach programs will provide information \nto affected people on microfinance opportunities. These programs will be independent from, but \ncomplementary to, the projects described in this paper; separate Board approval will be sought \nfor these assistance grants.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED TSUNAMI-AFFECTED AREAS REBUILDING PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe  objective  of  the  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  is  to  rapidly \nimprove  the  living  conditions  and  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  tsunami-\naffected  areas  by  restoring  basic  social  infrastructure,  community  and  public  services,  and \nlivelihoods in these areas.  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nTAARP will address the needs of the tsunami-affected people through subprojects in a \nvariety  of  sectors  formulated  in  response  to  requests  from  tsunami-affected  persons  and  the \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n                                                 \n12  After  the  ongoing  process  of  reconciling  the  three,  it  is  expected  that  a  commonly  agreed  national  coastal \n\nreconstruction plan will emerge.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nGovernment or as logical extensions of current ADB interventions, to address tsunami damage \nand  provide  further  environmental  protection.  All  new  construction  will  be  in  accordance  with \nGovernment  regulations  and  guidelines  for  tsunami  reconstruction.  A  detailed  breakdown  of \ncomponent  activities  and  sector  subproject  selection  criteria  is  presented  in  Appendix 5a.  An \noverview  of  the  subproject  selection  process  is  presented  in  Appendix 6.  Governance,  anti-\ncorruption and legal empowerment are also addressed. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Legal Assistance, Governance and Anticorruption  \n\n \n29. \nThe destruction wrought by the tsunami has generated legal and documentary issues for \ntsunami-affected  people  and  the  Government,  and  the  generous  contributions  of  foreign \nassistance  have  raised  potential  governance  and  corruption  issues  for  the  government.    The \nLegal Assistance, Governance and Anticorruption Component seeks to address these issues. It \nwill  provide  legal  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  victims  to  help  them  address  legal  and \ndocumentary issues arising from the tsunami. It will also establish a decentralized mechanism \nfor  tsunami  victims  for  private  dispute  resolution  and  grievance  review  against  public  officials. \nThree proposals for achieving this end are currently under discussion with the government, and \nit is most likely to involve a combination of these mechanisms. They are establishing (a) tsunami \nmediation  boards  to  address  tsunami  related  disputes  and  grievances,  based  on  existing  and \nworking  statutory  mediation  boards;  (b)  a  decentralized  office  of  tsunami  ombudsmen,  or  an \nextension of the work of the existing Ombudsmen to deal with grievances against public officials \nrelating  to  the  tsunami;  and/or  (c)  establishing  a  unit  within  the  administrative  division  of  Sri \nLanka\u2019s  Bribery  and  Corruption  Commission,  to  concentrate  on  detecting,  investigating,  and \notherwise  responding  to  corruption  in  tsunami-assistance.  In  addition,  training  and  awareness \nworkshops  will  be  conducted  for  judges,  magistrates,  district  officials,  and  the  public  on  the \npotential tsunami or disaster emergency related legal issues, disputes or cases that are likely to \narise. This will include the tsunami legislative framework that is currently under consideration for \nmaking special provision for persons and property affected by the tsunami.  \n \n30. \nThe  replacement  of  birth,  death,  and  marriage  certificates,  and  property  titles,  and \nidentification  cards  will  be  supported.  Methods  used  for  replacing  documents  will  include \nsupporting the collection and coordination of data by the relevant departments and offices, and \nthrough  modernizing  computer  collection  of  such  data;  transforming  manual  central  record \nkeeping  at  the  Registrar  General\u2019s  department  and  the  Department  of  the  Registration  of \nPersons  into  computerized  record  keeping,  and  facilitating  the  connectivity,  coordination  and \nnetworking  of  such  information.  This  will  facilitate  location  of  records  lost  by  tsunami  victims, \nand  hence  the  reissue  of  relevant  certificates  and  cards.  In  the  process  of  data  collection, \ntsunami  victim  identity  cards  will  be  provided  so  as  to  reduce  the  extent  false  claims  for \nassistance  can  be  made.  TAARP  will  also  support  transparency  of  tsunami  and  emergency \nassistance, through the Office of the President by supporting the publication in Sinhala, Tamil, \nand English, on the internet and in government newspapers, of (i) modes of tsunami assistance \nfrom  development  partners  and  NGOs,  (ii)  contract  and  procurement  details  in  relation  to \ntsunami-assistance,  (iii) any  proposed  laws,  bills,  or  policy relating  to  tsunami  assistance,  and \n(iv) Sri Lanka\u2019s assistance to tsunami-affected people.  \n \n31. Finally, the MOFP will be assisted to ensure good governance in NGO provision of tsunami \nassistance  by  supporting  the  development  of  guidelines  or  regulations  on  NGO  governance, \naccountability,  transparency,  and  registration  in  the  provision  of  tsunami  assistance.  An \nextensive description of these components is provided in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n\f2. \n\nComponent B: North East Coastal Community Development \n\n \n32. \nCoastal  communities  in  the  districts  of  Jaffna,  Mullaittivu,  Kilinochchi,  Trincomalee, \nBatticaloa  and  Ampara  that  were  affected  by  the  tsunami  will  receive  support  under  this \ncomponent.  Communities  that  have  been  affected  by  the  tsunami  in  terms  of  loss  of  life, \ndestruction of assets, and disruption of livelihoods will be identified for support. Communities\u2014\ni.e.,  Grama  Niladhari  divisions  (footnote 7)\u2014that  meet  the  criteria  will  receive  support  for: \n(i) construction  of  small-scale  community  infrastructure;  (ii) livelihood  development  activities; \nand  (iii) community  development  planning  and  coordination  at  the  local  authority  level.  In \naddition, this component will support restoration and sustainable management of natural habitat \ndamaged during the tsunami and support coastal resource planning and management at district \nand provincial levels.  \n \n33. \nInfrastructure.  Small-scale  community  infrastructure  could  include  minor  roads, \nculverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement  schemes,  community  buildings  and  market  and/or  auction  halls.  Livelihood \nsupport interventions will consist of advisory services to identify and develop suitable livelihood \noptions  (including  small  enterprises),  skills  development,  and  transfer  of  technology.  These \nadvisory  services  will  be  linked  with  microcredit  provided  under  component  G.  All  these \nactivities will need to be coordinated at the local authority level, so support for such coordination \nand planning will be provided under this component.  \n \n34. \nCoastal  Zone  Planning.  The  tsunami  highlighted  the  importance  of  coastal  zone \nplanning  in  averting  or  at  least  reducing  the  impact  of  natural  disasters.  TAARP  will  support \ncoastal  zone  planning  that  takes  into  account  existing  natural  habitats  and  land  use  patterns. \nThe  planning  process  will  be  participatory,  with  coordination  at  division,  district,  and  provincial \nlevels, and eventual integration with the National Coastal Zone Management Plan.  \n \nNatural  Resources.  Restoration  of  degraded  or  destroyed  natural  habitats  will  be \n35. \nundertaken through a community-based process. TAARP will support restoration of such areas \nand  concurrently  develop  livelihood  or  supplementary  income  generating  activities  that  will \nbenefit  adjacent  communities  and  thereby  ensure  sustainable  management  of  the  natural \nhabitat.  \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Road Rehabilitation and Reconstruction \n\n \nNational  Roads.  Subprojects  will  rehabilitate,  reconstruct,  or  improve  road  links \n36. \ndamaged by the tsunami and improve the transport network overall. Among other benefits, this \nwill improve the response to disasters. Access along tsunami-affected coastal roads has been \nrestored,  albeit  through  temporary  repairs.  However,  the  road  resurfacing  and  embankment \nrestorations  that  have  been  carried  out  are  not  anticipated  to  last  beyond  the  next  monsoon \nseason. Tsunami-affected roads will be rebuilt according to national standards for each class of \nroad. Road works will include reconstruction of previously-surfaced roads and drainage, location \nand  removal  of  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  repair  or  replacement  of  bridges  as \nnecessary, and a review of \u201cblack-spot\u201d or accident-prone areas so safety improvements can be \nincorporated  into  civil  works.  Road  works  will  be  designed  to  improve  roads  and  make  them \nmore  resistant  to  expected  coastal  weather  and  drainage  patterns.  Road  shoulders  will  be \npaved where possible to provide better access and safer conditions for cyclists and pedestrians. \nAbout 300 kilometers (km) of major coastal road links (class A and B) in tsunami-affected areas \nin the South and North East of Sri Lanka will be rebuilt.  \n \n\n8 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nSubject to Board approval, and successful conclusion of a joint cofinancing agreement, \n37. \nADB  will  administer  a  European  Commission  grant  to  rehabilitate  sections  of  the  Matara-\nBatticaloa national road under TAARP. TAARP will both rebuild the roads after the tsunami and \nimprove  connections  between  the  southern  and  eastern  road  networks.  This  will  facilitate \ndelivery of supplies and promote economic development in conflict-affected areas.  \n \n38. \nAccess Roads. The local government roads subcomponent will include rehabilitation of \naccess  road  networks  and  bridges  damaged  by  the  tsunami  in  the  Galle,  Matara  and \nHambantota  districts.  About  200 km  of  damaged  class  C,  D,  and  E  provincial  roads  in  the \nSouthern Province will be rebuilt and provided with improved drainage. Another 200 km of rural \nroads  will  be  rebuilt  in  the  coastal  belt.  Road  safety  improvements  will  be  incorporated  into \ndesigns  as  necessary.  Where  possible,  debris  will  be  recycled  for  use  as  road  sub-base \nmaterial for construction.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent D: Water Supply and Sanitation \n\n \nDrinking  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  in  Hambantota,  Batticaloa  and  Muttur \n39. \ndistricts  (which  were  affected  by  the  tsunami)  will  be  repaired  and  expanded.  Subprojects  will \nprovide  for  additional  distribution  using  temporary  intakes  and  for  community-based  water \nsupply together with individual sanitation facilities.  \n \n\n5. \n\nComponent E: Southern Province Reconstruction \n\n \n40. \nInfrastructure. Subprojects in component E will restore livelihoods by creating jobs for \nlocally-based skilled and unskilled labor and reconstructing community and urban infrastructure, \nwhich  could  include  local  government  roads,  culverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and \nsanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  management  schemes,  village  markets  (polas), \nayurvedic  (traditional  medicine)  dispensaries,  children\u2019s  parks,  playgrounds,  community \nbuildings and rest houses, market and/or auction halls. Training for new employment skills will \nbe offered. Physical infrastructure and buildings, such as public libraries, courts, police stations, \nprisons,  and  district  registry  offices  needed  to  reestablish  an  effective  law  and  public \nadministration  system  will  also  be  reconstructed.  Designs  for  reconstructed  buildings  will \nprovide disabled access. Community-level subprojects will be selected and prioritized generally \nthrough  the  subproject  selection  process  described  in  Appendix 6.  TAARP  will  also  support \ncommunity development planning and coordination at the local authority level.  \n \nShelter.  Nearly  100,000  houses  were  destroyed  by  the  tsunami.  Other  donors  have \n41. \nmade  significant  commitments  for  the  reconstruction  of  damaged  or  destroyed  housing  in \ntsunami-affected  areas.  However,  if  demands  remain  unmet,  this  component  will  construct \nshelter  for  vulnerable  tsunami-affected  families  in  the  Southern  Province.  Shelter  will  be \nprovided  in  situ\u2014only  at  preexisting  house  sites\u2014and  in  accordance  with  Government \nregulations  for  tsunami  reconstruction,  including  Government  policy  on  selection  and  total \nassistance  allowance  per  family.  If  adequate  donor  financing  is  available  for  shelter \nreconstruction,  funds  for  this  subcomponent  will  be  used  for  other  village  and  community \ninfrastructure subprojects.  \n \n\n6. \n\nComponent F: Coastal Resources Management \n\n \nSubprojects  will  repair  damage  done  to  coastal  stabilization  structures  and  harbor \n42. \nbreakwaters,  extend  such  structures,  identify  additional  sites  for  improvements,  and  provide \nsmall fishing boat anchorages and fisheries-related ancillary units, such as boat-building yards, \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \n\nnet repair sheds, or cold-storage facilities, in the Southern and Western provinces. Subprojects \nwill  also  provide  enhanced  coastal  protection  and  environmental  management  along  the \naffected coasts by reestablishing green zones or green belts through intensive forestation with \ncoastal  vegetation,  including  mangroves.  These  green  zones  or  belts  will  be  effective  barriers \nagainst  coastal  erosion  and  other  potentially  life-threatening  events  such  as  cyclones, \nhurricanes, floods, tsunamis, and higher sea levels. Where practical, tsunami debris will be used \nas core fill material for construction of breakwaters and groins.  \n \n\n7. \n\nComponent G: Rural Finance  \n\n \n43. \nImmediate support is needed so affected people can rebuild their lives and regain their \ndignity,  and  so  local  economies  can  be  revived.  This  component  will  include  (i) restoring \nlivelihoods  of  affected  poor  households  or  groups  affected  by  the  tsunami  by  providing \nimmediate  access  to  noncommercial  microcredit,  (ii) supporting  microenterprise  and  skills \ntraining, (iii) mitigating risk by insuring affected households or individuals that receive assistance \nunder this component through life and property insurance schemes, and (iv) providing support \nfor  operational  costs  and  rebuilding  of  physical  assets  of  microfinance  institutions  in  remote \nareas.  \n \n44. \nA  major  change  in  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Program13 (RFSDP) was approved by ADB Vice President (Operations Group 1) \non  23  February  2005  to  provide  microcredit  will  be  provided  to  certain  classes  of  tsunami \naffected  people.  TAARP  will  provide  microcredit  on  similar  but  broader  terms  to  the  revised \narrangements  to  the  tsunami-affected  people  who  need  them  most\u2014low-income  households, \nwhich  comprise  about  75%  of  all  affected  households.  The  interest  rate  charged  will  be \nnoncommercial  and  in  line  with  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  directive  for  loans  to  tsunami-\naffected  persons.  These  loans,  together  with  rescheduling  of  existing  debts,  will  enable  more \nmoney  to  be  spent  on  household  needs.  Loans  to  affected  households  will  be  limited  to \nRs100,000 (approximately $1,000) to ensure a focus on poor households. The grant portion of \nthis component will be used to finance items (ii) to (v) above and detailed during inception.  \n \n\n8. \n\nComponent H: NECORD\u2014Tsunami \n\n \n45. \nSome of the basic and social infrastructure works already replaced or rehabilitated in the \nNorth  East  coastal  areas  under  NECORD  were  destroyed  by  the  tsunami.  Subprojects  will \nredesign and rebuild structures in the health, education, water supply and sanitation, irrigation, \nrural roads, village and community development infrastructure, and fishing sectors. Shelter and \ninstitutional  infrastructure,  including  courts  and  district  registries,  with  improved  access  for  the \ndisabled, will be provided at preexisting sites. Designs will incorporate risk-mitigating measures \nto improve durability and avert or reduce the impact of natural disasters.  \n \nC. \n \n46. \nTAARP  will  address  urgent  basic  needs  and  social  services  lost  as  a  result  of  the \ntsunami. If life in the affected and neighboring areas is to return to normal, social services must \nbe  restored,  destroyed  infrastructure  must  be  rebuilt,  and access  to  employment  opportunities \nmust  be  made  available.  TAARP  has  therefore  been  processed  under  ADB\u2019s  disaster  policy. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program.  Loan  2041-SRI. \nManila.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nthat  vulnerable \n\nSince  interventions  will  typically  replace  preexisting  assets\u2014reconstructed  to  appropriate \ncontemporary standards\u2014economic analysis is not required.14 Investments will be made on the \nbasis  of  least-cost  restoration  of  preexisting  facilities.  The  procedures  for  project  loan \nprocessing, procurement, consultant engagement, subproject selection, and the type of works to \nbe done reflect this flexibility, without sacrificing quality, transparency, or safeguards. However, \nefforts  will  be  made  to  provide  proper  targeting,  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  and \ncommunity participation and to address area resource and capacity constraints.  \n \nADB will focus on ensuring project implementation is efficient, effective, and expedient. \n47. \nFollowing  the  disaster  policy,  additional  resources  have  been  dedicated  to  implementation, \nsupervision  and  monitoring,  including  (i)  support  for  the  National  Procurement  Agency,  (ii) \nprovision  of  resettlement  specialists  and  external  monitors  for  unanticipated  resettlement  and \nland acquisition, (iii) an environment specialist to assist environmental assessment of tsunami-\nrelated  projects  by \nthe  Government's  Central  Environmental  Authority,  (iv)  additional \naccountants, (v) private sector financial auditors, and (vi) performance auditors.  \n \nThe  volume  and  scale  of  foreign  assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  will  generate  a  risk  of \n48. \ncorruption. The Government is committed to a zero-tolerance policy against corruption, and to \nensuring \ntsunami-affected  people  are  adequately  protected.  TAARP \nincorporates  features  specifically  designed  to  address  these  risks.  It  provides  for  enhanced \nsupervision and monitoring, regular financial and random performance audits, and measures to \nincrease transparency of tsunami assistance and policy, through publication of tsunami-related \nassistance and information in all three languages, in government newspapers and the internet. \nIt  requires  participation and  consultation  with  local  government,  and  civil  society  stakeholders, \nstarting  with  the  planning  and  policy-setting  stage.  District-level  consultations  will  be  held  to \ncomplete the needs assessment that will provide the framework for reconstruction activity. It will \nalso establishes decentralized mechanism(s) for ensuring public accountability, and addressing \nprivate grievances either by tsunami ombudsmen, tsunami mediation boards, or establishing a \ntsunami  unit  within  the  administrative  division  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Bribery  and  Corruption \nCommission.  In  addition,  by  establishing  decentralized  provision  of  legal  assistance  and \nfacilitation,  TAARP  provides  a  means  of  legal  empowerment  and  allows  vulnerable  and  poor \ntsunami-affected people to access formal and informal channels of accountability and grievance \nreview.  Finally,  the  issuance  and  reissuance  of  identification  cards,  computer  automation  of \nmanual  record  keeping  systems,  and \nimproved  and  networked  coordination  amongst \ndepartments  accessing  data  will  limit  the  extent  that  persons  can  abuse  systems  for  tsunami \nassistance. These features are described in detail in Appendix 8.  \n \nD. \n \n49. \nThe  total  cost  of  TAARP  is  estimated  at  $249.3 million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties  of  $36.7 million.  Table  1  contains  a  summary  cost  estimate.  Detailed  project  costs  and \nthe financing plan are provided in Appendix 9a.  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                 \n14  Para. 103 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.  \n\n\f12 \n\nItem \n\nGrant: a \n\nTable 1: TAARP Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n1.

As a result of the \nactive  participation  between  development  partners,  including  international  organizations, \nbilateral partners, and NGOs in coordination efforts post-tsunami, several development partners \nhave  expressed  willingness  to  provide  cofinancing  for  various  interventions  to  be  made  by \nTAARP.  The  European  Commission  is  prepared  to  provide  joint  cofinancing  with  ADB  for \ncomponent C, on the condition described in paragraphs 80 and 81 below. In addition, ADB has \ngarnered the interest of development partners in providing cofinancing18 for the construction of \nrural  roads  in  the  North  and  East,  coastal  community  livelihood  assistance  in  the  East,  and \ngeneral rehabilitation in the conflict-affected areas in the North and East. Given the short time \nframe for processing the Project, and considering the approval schedules of the various donors, \nfirm  cofinancing  commitments  for  additional  expressions  of  interest,  are  expected  only  after \nimplementation  begins.  Such  resources  would  be  used  to  supplement  not  substitute  for  ADB \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.  2002.

ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  committed  to \nallocating if necessary their funds to fill gaps identified by the reconstruction plan that cannot be \naddressed by other financing sources.  \n \n56. \nADB has typically sought Board approval for the administration of the loan or grant funds \nof  new  co-financiers  only  when  firm  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  In  light  of  (i)  the \nneed for expediency and efficiency in ADB\u2019s response to the tsunami disaster and emergency, \nand (ii) the current advanced stage of discussions with a number of cofinanciers that are likely \nto  support  TAARP  subject  to  their  own  internal  approvals,  Management  requests  Board \napproval of the administration of additional cofinance funds obtained from development partners \nsubsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of such additional cofinance funds would be \nconfirmed  and  approved  by  Management,  and  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the \nusual quarterly reporting. This procedure would only be adopted to the extent that the additional \nfunds provided by cofinanciers would not materially alter or fundamentally affect the objectives, \npurposes, and scope of the existing Project.19 Any proposed cofinance that did materially alter or \nfundamentally affect the objectives, purposes, and scope of TAARP would be processed as a \nmajor  change  in  scope  and  circulated  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project \nAdministration Instructions 5.0420 and the usual practice.  \n\nJustification for Special Loan Terms and Grants  \n\n \n\nF. \n \n\n1. \n\nADB Loan  \n\n \n57. \nSri Lanka is a tsunami-affected country beginning rehabilitation and reconstruction. It is \nalso recovering from conflict and making the transition to peace and stability. The disaster policy \nmodifies the prevailing ADF lending terms approved by the ADB Board so they are appropriate \nfor  disaster,  emergency,  and  post-conflict  assistance.21  ADB  has  approved  the  use  of  such \nterms in Bangladesh for the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (January 2005), in \nSri  Lanka  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development \u2013 Extension  Project22 \nand  in  the  Maldives  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (the  Approved  Loans).  The  loan \nfrom  the  portfolio  reallocation  from  the  ADF  would  be  made  on  concessional  terms  permitted \nunder  ADB's  Disaster  Policy  and  the  same  as  those  of  the  Approved  Loans.  The  term  of  the \nloan will be 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with a repayment of principal at 2% \nper  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  a  year  thereafter,  to  be  paid \nsemiannually, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum.  \n \n\n2. \n\nATF Grant \n\nSri  Lanka  is  eligible  to  receive  tsunami  grant  funds  in  accordance  with  the  terms \n\n \n58. \napproved by the Board under the Asian Tsunami Fund.23  \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2001.

Some  of  the  improvements  that  have  been  made  by  these \nprojects sustained tsunami damage, resulting in a change in overall project quantity within the \nexisting  scope  of  the  project  or  minor  increases  to  the  existing  scope.  Road  Network \nImprovement24  (RNIP)  is  rehabilitating  national  roads  (class  A  and  B)  nationwide,  including \nbridges  as  required.  Coastal  Resources  Management25  (CRMP)  is  providing  coastal  shoreline \nprotection  measures  and  harbor  facilities  in  Southern  and  Western  provinces.  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development26 (NECORD) is rebuilding community-level basic and \nsocial infrastructure damaged or destroyed throughout the North East. Southern Province Rural \nEconomic Advancement27 (SPREAP) is rehabilitating roads and village markets in the Southern \nProvince.  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation28 \n(STWSS)  is  providing  water  supply  schemes  and  independent  sanitation  facilities  for  four \nsecondary  towns  in  the  Central,  South  and  East  provinces.  North  East  Coastal  Community \nDevelopment Project29 (NECCDP) is improving coastal community infrastructure, protecting the \ncoastal environment, and providing a credit facility for coastal dwellers in the Eastern Province. \nRural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  (footnote  13)  provides  microcredit  through  140 \nparticipating microfinance institutions nationwide.  \n \n60. \nFor  component  A,  a  project  office,  led  by  the  component  coordinator/director,  and \nsupported  adequately  to  conduct  the  component  A  activities,  would  be  established  within  the \nMOJ. For components B through H, TAARP will be implemented through these existing project \nmanagement  units  (together  with  the  project  office  for  component  A,  hereinafter  called  the \nPMUs).  Although  from  ADB's  loan  processing  perspective  this  approach  may  initially  appear \ncomplex,  from  the  Government's  perspective  and  from  the  perspective  of  ensuring  effective, \nefficient,  and  rapid  implementation  and  the  fastest  delivery  of  benefits  to  affected  people,  it  is \nthe  most  straightforward.  It  will  strengthen  existing  offices  and  institutions  that  are  already \nfunctioning well, rather than developing new ones.  \n \nBecause  of  the  large  amount  of  additional  funding  that  they  will  administer,  each PMU \n61. \nwill be strengthened to accommodate the additional workload.

With the exception of component A, each component of TAARP will be administered by \nthe relevant ADB division currently administering the parent loan project. Component A will be \nadministered  by  the  ADB  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission  in  Colombo  with  the  assistance  of  the \nOffice of the General Counsel. However, given the complexity and sensitivity of TAARP and the \nneed for close coordination with the actors in the North East\u2014the Government, LTTE, external \nassistance agencies, NGOs, and others\u2014all components under TAARP will be administered in \nclose  cooperation  with  the  Resident  Mission.  In  addition,  the  Resident  Mission  will  appoint  a \nnational officer with joint disbursement and financial management responsibilities. Among other \nthings, \nfinancial  management  specialist  will  (i) pre-screen  withdrawal  applications, \n(ii) monitor statement of expenditure (SOE) performance and assist in the SOE audit, (iii) review \nsubproject documentation to assess financial sustainability, (iv) review audit reports and attempt \nto  clear  outstanding  audit  observations,  and  (v) provide  disbursement  training  to  PMU  and \nDPMU staff during project implementation to ensure efficient disbursement.  \n \n69. \nA financial management assessment of the selected PMUs and the DPMUs was carried \nout  with  the  objective  of  reviewing  their  internal  control  frameworks,  disbursement  constraints, \nand  audit  issues.  Each  PMU  and  DPMU  follows  the  ledger-based  manual  government \naccounting system. Although it is not ideal, this system is acceptable to ADB. Staff at each PMU \nand DPMU possess sufficient accounting skills, but some PMU and DPMUs will add accounting \nstaff.  These  additional  staff  will  be  financed  by  the  ATF  grant.  No  significant  disbursement \nissues  or  constraints  were  identified  in  any  of  the  PMUs  or  DPMUs.  The  Resident  Mission\u2019s \nfinancial  management  specialist  will  closely  monitor  project  accounting  aspects  and  provide \ndisbursement training where necessary to PMUs and DPMUs during implementation. The audit \nreports of four32 PMUs were reviewed and all were found to be unqualified. In all but one case, \nreports were received before the due dates. For the remaining three projects33 the first audit is \ndue  only  in  the  latter  part  of  fiscal  year  2005.  In  addition,  an  SOE  audit  of  the  ongoing  loans \nbeing  managed  by  all  PMUs  will  be  conducted  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  of  the \nproposed  project  as  a  means  of  providing  further  assurance  on  the  internal  controls  in  each \nPMU.

Subprojects  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with \nsector-specific  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  (Appendix 5a).  In  addition, \nregardless  of  the  sector,  each  subproject  proposal  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  general \ncriteria, as set forth below.  \n \n\nThe  subproject  will  rehabilitate  or  reconstruct  tsunami-damaged  infrastructure, \nand/or directly address the requirements of tsunami-affected people. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n \n(viii) \n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n\nfor \n\nThe  subproject  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  based  on  the  tsunami  needs \nassessment \ninto  account  consultations  with \nbeneficiaries and affected people. \nThe  subproject  will  reflect  the  requirement  that  there  should  be  a  reasonable \nbalance of activities among communities and districts. \n\nthe  area  and  will \n\ntake \n\nThe  subproject  will  not  be  financed  by  ADB  if  it  is  being  financed  by  another \ndevelopment  partner,  unless  the  other  development  partner  and  ADB  are \ncofinancing it, and where practical, preference will be given to other development \npartners that express interest in financing the subproject. \n\nThe  subproject  will  be  technically  feasible,  financially  sustainable,  and  will \nrepresent the least-cost alternative, taking into account the need to provide for a \nreasonable increase in demand in the future;  \n\nThe  equipment,  materials,  and  other  resources  required  can  be  acquired  in,  or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction or delay. \n\nThe subproject can be completed within the remaining implementation period; \n\nThe subproject will not use asbestos in construction or as a construction material.  \n\nThe  subproject  will  be  in  compliance  with  the  Government's  environmental \nrequirements,  ADB's  Environment  Policy34  (2002),  and  the  Environmental \nAssessment  and  Review  Framework.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  the  IEE  will  be  included  in  the  subproject \nproposal, and government environmental clearance will have been obtained prior \nto  the  award  of  the  subproject  contract.  The  subproject  is  not  a  Category  A \nsubproject. \n\nThe  subproject  will  not,  to  the  extent  possible,  require  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  If  either  of  these  is,  in  fact,  required  in  the  course  of \nTAARP, it will be conducted in conformity with the Government\u2019s applicable law \nand policy, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy 35 (1995), and the resettlement \nframework.  \n\n                                                 \n34  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n\n\f20 \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\nThe subproject will, to the extent possible, not affect any indigenous peoples, but \nif the subproject does affect indigenous peoples, it has been or will be prepared \nand  conducted  in  accordance  with  applicable  law,  ADB\u2019s  Indigenous  People\u2019s \nPolicy, and the Indigenous People\u2019s Development Framework;  \n\nEqual  access  to  resources,  services  and  opportunities  for  women  and  men  will \nbe promoted in subproject design, planning and implementation.  \n\nThe  subproject  will  incorporate  strengthening  to  multi-hazard  standards  with \nadequate  provision \nimprovement  and  quality  control, \nconsidering cost effectiveness, and least cost alternatives. \n\ntechnological \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nAlthough  project  administration  systems \n\n \n71. \nfully \nfunctioning,  and  subproject  implementation  can  therefore  commence  quickly,  the  geographic \ndistribution  and  extent  of  damage  caused  by  the  tsunami  necessitate  that  TAARP  be \nimplemented  over  a  4-year  period.  This  will  provide  time  to  design  and  package  civil  works \ncontracts\u2014particularly  for  road  rebuilding\u2014and  for  adequate  consultation  and  development  of \nvarious  village  and  community  subprojects.  The  scheduled  completion  date  is  30  June  2009 \n(Appendix 11).  \n \n\nfor  each  component  are  already \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Environmental Measures \n\n \nTAARP  is  not  expected  to  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement;  only  vacant  state-\n72. \nowned land is expected to be used for subproject improvements. Rehabilitation and rebuilding \nwill  typically  take  place  only  at  existing  infrastructure  locations.  The  works  will  be  designed  to \nensure  that  improvements  will  be  within  existing  property  boundaries.  However,  a  summary \nresettlement  framework  (Appendix 12)  has  been  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  \nWhile  no  resettlement  is  anticipated,  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework  sets  out  the \ncompensation and other entitlements for any unanticipated land acquisition and/or resettlement. \nIn addition, the Financing Agreements contain detailed covenants that require the Government \nto  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  policy  and  legal  framework \nfor  Government  post-tsunami  assistance  is  being  developed,  with  new  guidelines  recently \nadopted,  and  new  laws  under  consideration.36  While  a  Resettlement  Framework  is  usually \nfinalized by Board approval, the agreed Resettlement Framework for TAARP may be refined by \nADB in consultation with the Government prior to any land acquisition and/or resettlement under \nTAARP,  to  improve  implementation  in  light  of  the  Governments\u2019  post-tsunami  policy  and  legal \nframework.  Such  refinements  would  be  made  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), as would be allowed under the disaster policy.37  \n \n73. \nSince  TAARP\u2019s  aim  is  to  rebuild  preexisting  infrastructure  damaged  or  destroyed  as  a \nresult of the tsunami, it is classified as environmental category B. No subprojects classified as \ncategory A by ADB will be financed under TAARP. A generic initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  has  been  prepared  to  identify  potential  impacts  that  could  result  from  TAARP,  to \nrecommend  mitigation  measures  and  to  suggest  suitable  monitoring  mechanisms.  The \n                                                 \n36  E.g.

In addition, two bills are currently under consideration. \n\n37 Para. 95 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nsummary IEE is presented in Appendix 13. While TAARP may lead to temporary and reversible \nlocalized  negative  impacts,  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  foreseen. \nSubprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment  procedures  stipulated  in  the  environmental \nassessment  framework  (Appendix 14).  The  environmental  assessment  framework  has  been \ndeveloped to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental regulations.  \n \n74. \nA  few  small  communities  of  indigenous  people  (the  Veddas)  were  affected  by  the \ntsunami and may be affected by TAARP, which is designed to ensure that all communities, on \nan equitable basis, will benefit from TAARP. In the event of their involvement in any subprojects, \nall necessary actions required under ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) will be taken. \nTAARP will address the special needs of minority communities in the context of their social and \ncultural systems. An indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) has been prepared to \naddress  potential  impacts  on  these  communities.  The  IPDF  provides  a  policy  framework  to \nscreen  impacts  of  the  subprojects  on  the  coastal  Veddas  and,  accordingly,  to  prepare  an \nappropriate  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  or  specific  actions  for  the  subprojects \naffecting the coastal Veddas. A summary IPDF is presented in Appendix 15.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n\ntwo-envelope  procedures  where \n\n \nProcurement of goods and services under TAARP will be carried out in accordance with \n75. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  disaster  policy  permits  flexible  interpretation  of  these  guidelines,  so  project \nactivities can start promptly. ADB has also been advising the National Procurement Agency on \nmeasures  the  Government  can  take  to  streamline  and  accelerate  the  procurement  process \nwithout  sacrificing  transparency  and  competition.  Consultant  support  will  be  provided  through \nTAARP to continue and formalize procedural improvements.  \n \nFor civil works contracts with estimated values greater than $5 million, procurement will \n76. \nbe  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  with \nestimated  values  of  $5 million  and  below,  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  LCB  civil  works  procurement  will \ntsunami-related \ninclude  single-stage, \nprocurement, local competitive bidding periods can be reduced from 21 to 15 days.  \n \n77. \nEquipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  by  international  shopping  where  the \nestimated  cost  is  between  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through  local  procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Items \ncosting less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n78. \nThe  standard  bidding  documents  previously  approved  by  ADB  under  RNIP,  STWSS, \nand CRMP, will be adopted for subprojects in components C, D, and F, subject to a one-time \nreview by ADB to ensure that they still comply with ADB requirements. ADB will permit after-the-\nfact approval in accordance with the Project Administration Instructions for all civil works valued \nat more than $500,000 and for supply contracts valued at more than $250,000, prior to award of \nthe  respective  contracts.  For  contracts  valued  at  less  than  these  amounts,  the  respective \nexecuting agencies (EAs) will submit copies of the signed contracts and bid evaluation reports \nfor approval after-the-fact. However, if ADB does not approve the award or terms of any such \ncontract,  the  Government  will  not  use  loan  or  grant  proceeds  to  finance  such  contract,  and  in \nthe  event  that  loan  or  grant  proceeds  are  used  to  finance  such  contract,  the  Government  will \n\nrelevant.  For \n\n\f22 \n\n \n \n\nto \n\nfacilitate \n\nrefund to ADB any such payment. An independent procurement audit, if required, is provided for \nin TAARP project costs.  \n \n79. \nContractors already engaged through competitive bidding under ongoing loans may be \ndirectly contracted for new civil works contracts for $1,000,000 or less and supply contracts for \n$500,000 or less, without resorting to new bidding and prequalification. This will be done where \npractical, or when such hiring would be a logical extension of services already underway.  \n \nAs  described  above  in  para.  55,  the  European  Commission  is  prepared  to  commit  to \n80. \nprovide joint cofinancing with ADB, allowing ADB to catalyze additional resources for the Project \nand  tsunami  assistance.  For  the  European  Commission  to  participate,  it  requires  non-\ndiscrimination  against  all  its  members  in  procurement  processes.  Thus,  while  most  of  the \ninvestments  to  be  supported  by  the  Project  are  expected  to  come  from  within  Sri  Lanka  or  to \ninvolve  some  procurement \nthe  European \nfrom  ADB  member  countries, \nCommission\u2019s  commitment  to  cofinance  \u20ac40 million  of  roads  under  Component  C,  Board \napproval is now being sought to allow procurement in, and procurement of eligible goods and \nservices from, member countries of the European Union, including ADB non-member countries. \nThis would facilitate maximum and expeditious development and catalyze additional resources \nfrom development partners in the current post-tsunami emergency circumstance.  \n \nThe  request  for  Board  approval  is  being  made  pursuant  to  Article  14(ix)  of  the  ADB \n81. \nCharter, which states that the Board may, by a vote of the Directors representing not less than \ntwo  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  approve  procurement  from  non-ADB \nmember  countries  in  appropriate  circumstances.38  The  Charter  provides  one,  non-exclusive, \nexample  of  what  may  constitute  \u201cappropriate  circumstances\u201d  for  allowing  procurement  in  non-\nADB  member  countries  or  procurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  non-ADB  member \ncountries.  It  states  that  the  Charter\u2019s  requirement  that  procurement  occur  only  in  member \ncountries may be lifted \u201cin the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of \nfinancing has been provided to the Bank.\u201d This example is similar to the current proposal. The \nEuropean  Commission  is  providing  a  grant  of  \u20ac40 million,  which  is  a  significant  amount  of \nfinancing  that  matches  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  component  C  of  TAARP.  The  European  Union, \nwhich  is  supporting  the  European  Commission\u2019s  provision  of  such  financing  includes  ADB \nmembers  and  non-members  that  are  together  providing  this  contribution  by  way  of  joint \ncofinancing  for  TAARP.  The  Board\u2019s  approval  for  lifting  the  procurement  restriction  is  being \nrequested only in support of component C of TAARP. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  procurement  of \n82. \ncivil  works,  including  inviting  and  receiving  bids  for  contracts,  for  subprojects  that  might  be \napproved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing TAARP.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n38  Article 14(ix) of the Charter, provides: \u201cThe proceeds of any loan, investment or other financing undertaken in the \nordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds established by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1(I) of Article \n19, shall be used only for procurement in member countries of goods and services produced in member countries, \nexcept  in  any  case  in which  the  Board  of  Directors  by  a  vote  of  the  Directors  representing  not less  than \ntwo-thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in a non-member \ncountry or of goods and services produced in a non-member country in special circumstances making such \nprocurement appropriate, as in the case of a nom-member country in which a significant amount of financing has \nbeen provided to the Bank.\u201d[emphasis added]  \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nfor \n\nto  ADB \n\nthe  engagement  of \n\n \n83. \nConsulting services will be required for the development of detailed designs and contract \npackages  and  for  community  development  planning  in  several  components.  Consultants  will \nalso be required to support the Government\u2019s implementing structures currently being formed at \nnational  and  regional  levels  with  project  management  and  overall  monitoring  responsibilities. \nGiven the need to expedite delivery of project benefits to affected people, the Government has \nasked  that  consultants  for  component  C  be  engaged  by  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory \ninternational  and  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \nConsultants  for  component  C,  road  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  will  be  selected \n84. \nfrom among existing consultant design firms already engaged in ongoing road sector projects in \nSri  Lanka,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance,  based  on  bio-data  proposals  using  the  quality \nand  cost-based  method  of  selection.  The  period  for  the  proposals  will  be  21  days.  A \nprocurement specialist will be provided through this contract to assist the National Procurement \nAgency  in  expediting  civil  works  and  equipment  procurement  procedures  and  refining \nguidelines. An environmental specialist will also be provided to assist the Central Environment \nAuthority review and assess environmental assessment for tsunami related subprojects.  \n \n85. \nConsulting design services required for component D and component F will be engaged \nthrough  direct  selection,  and  will  extend  existing  contracts  under  STWSS  (footnote  28)  and \nCRMP  (footnote  25),  respectively.  New  individual  consultants,  primarily  in  accounting  and \ngeneral engineering, will be selected and engaged on all components in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Individual consultants will be engaged for the governance, \nlegal  assistance  and  anticorruption  component  including  to  provide  legal  assistance,  training \nand  awareness  building;  coordination,  monitoring,  and  supervision;  computerized  data \ncollection, and related computer services including web design. Individual consultants will also \nassist  in  preparing  gender-oriented  economic  activities  and  business  cooperatives.  NGOs  will \nassist  implementation  of  village  and  community  development  subprojects.  TAARP  will  require \napproximately  115  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  881  person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  representative  consultant \nassignments are provided in Appendix 16.  \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \n86. \nconsultants,  including  preparing  and  negotiating  direct  selection  contracts  with  consultants \nalready  installed  on  other  ongoing ADB-financed  projects.  The  Government  has  been  advised \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing TAARP.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n87. \nDisbursement  arrangements  for  each  component  will  follow  the  existing  fund  flow  and \ndisbursement arrangements at each existing PMU and DPMU. Given the emergency nature of \nthe  proposed  project  and \nthe  disbursement \narrangements  at  established  PMUs  are  considered  optimal  for  financing  activities  in  a  speedy \nand  effective  manner.  Under  component  A,  component  C,  component  D  and  component  G, \nimprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL),  and  second \ngeneration imprest accounts will be established at banks agreed with ADB. Under component B, \ncomponent  E,  and  component  H,  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  CBSL,  second \n\nfinancial  management  assessment, \n\nthe \n\n\f24 \n\n \n \n\ngeneration  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  the  provincial  level,  and  third  generation \nimprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  DPMUs.  An  imprest  account  for  component  F  will  be \nestablished  at  CBSL.  Under  component  G,  separate  accounts  will  be  established  for  the  loan \nand  the  grant.  Such  accounts  will  be  established,  replenished  and  maintained  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Detailed  disbursements  arrangements  for  each \nTAARP component are in Appendix 17.  \n \n\n8. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n \n88. \nTo implement protective works and other tsunami-related activities, the Government has \nasked  for  retroactive  financing  for  immediate  imports,  rehabilitation  of  key  infrastructure  and \nfacilities, and provision of services and grants. ADB has agreed to provide retroactive financing \nof up to 30% of each component in tsunami-affected areas for eligible expenditures covering all \ndisbursement  categories  incurred  not  earlier  than  27  December  2004,  provided  that  the \nexpenditures  are  procured  in  accordance  with  agreed  procedures.  The  Government  has  been \nadvised  that  provision  of  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  any  part  of \nTAARP.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nEach EA, IA and PMU will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \n89. \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made for each TAARP component, including the \ngoods, works, and services financed by loan, grant and local funds. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Provision for financial auditing costs has \nbeen  included  in  the  cost  estimate  and  will  be  financed  through  TAARP.  Each  EA  will  submit \nannual  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of \neach  fiscal  year.  The  audit  of  imprest  accounts,  second-generation  imprest  accounts,  third-\ngeneration imprest accounts, and SOE will be carried out as part of the annual audit, with the \nauditor\u2019s opinion of each separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. Financial audits provided in 6 \nmonths  by  private  sector  auditors  may  be  provided  in  advance  of  the  Sri  Lankan  Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s  statutory  audited  accounts.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy,  ADB  and  Sri  Lanka  will \nconsult on the reasons for this and next steps to be followed.  \n \n90. \nEach  PMU  will  prepare  brief  progress  reports  each  month  for  their  respective \ncomponents  for  submission  to  ADB  and  their  EA.  In  addition,  PMUs  responsible  to  provincial \nproject coordinating committees (PPCCs) will submit quarterly reports to ADB and their PPCCs. \nSubproject  completion  reports,  which  identify  project  impact,  will  be  prepared  for  each \nsubproject. Within 3 months of the physical completion of TAARP, the Government will furnish \nto ADB an overall project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, \ncosts, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as \nmay be requested by ADB.  \n \n91. \nAs  required  by  the  ADB  disaster  policy,  provision  for  supervision  and  monitoring  of \nTAARP  has  been  enhanced  to  ensure  quality  and  effectiveness  at  a  time  when  the \nGovernment\u2019s  financial  and  human  resources  are  extended.39  Consultants  will  be  provided  to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  implementing  structures  currently  being  formed.  They  will  assist  at \nthe  national  and/or  regional \nlevels  with  project  management  and  overall  monitoring \nresponsibilities.  Procurement  specialists  will  assist  the  National  Procurement  Agency  in \n\n                                                 \n39  Para. 107 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nexpediting  civil  works  and  equipment  procurement  procedures  and  refining  guidelines.  In \naddition, independent auditors, civil society organizations (CSOs), or NGOs will be engaged to \nconduct semiannual performance audits during project implementation, to determine the degree \nto which TAARP funds have been effectively and efficiently used during implementation, and the \nextent  to  which  the  objectives,  outputs,  and  performance  indicators  have  been  achieved.  The \nfinal  performance  audit  (to  be  conducted  post  completion)  will  focus  on  governance,  financial \naccountability,  and  transparency.40  Provision  has  been  included  in  the  cost  estimates  to  cover \nperformance  auditing  throughout  implementation.  The  Government  will  be  responsible  for \ncovering the cost of the final post completion performance audit.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \nEach  PMU  has  established  performance  monitoring  indicators  and  relevant  baseline \n92. \ndata for their respective components. These existing monitoring mechanisms will be expanded, \nand  will  be  recorded  separately  for  each  component  under  TAARP.  For  activities  where \nsubprojects are formulated and designed during implementation, baseline indicators and targets \nfor each subproject, including the socioeconomic conditions of the beneficiaries, will be included \nas  part  of  the  subproject  proposal.  Baseline  data  for  road  projects  implemented  under \ncomponent  C  will  record  the  existing  \u201croughness\u201d  (based  on  a  visual  assessment)  and  traffic \nlevels.  The  management  information  system  developed  for  NECORD\u2014in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  evaluation  system\u2014will  be  updated  and  used  to \nmonitor subproject benefits and impacts for components B and H.  \n \n93. \nGender-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  during  project  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nMonitoring  systems  will  incorporate  such  data  and  processes  of  review  and  evaluation  would \ncover both quantitative and qualitative gender-based information.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n94. \nADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  (at  least  once  every  6  months)  throughout  project \nimplementation. TAARP will also be reviewed quarterly by the staff of the Resident Mission as \npart of the overall portfolio review process. Staff of the Resident Mission will also attend NPCC, \nand PPCC meetings in the South and the North East to consider and approve subprojects for \nimplementation.  Given  the  complexities  of  implementation  and  the  4-year  implementation \nperiod,  a  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  during  the  second  year  of  implementation,  about \nJune  2007,  for  which  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  detailed  progress  report  on  the \nimplementation and achievement of TAARP.  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED NORTH EAST COMMUNITY RESTORATION  \n\nAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  NECORD-II  is  rapidly  to  improve  the  living  conditions  and  well-\n95. \nbeing  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  conflict-affected  areas  by  restoring  basic  social \ninfrastructure, community and public services, and livelihoods. NECORD-II will also support and \naugment Sri Lanka\u2019s rehabilitation and relief efforts underway in the conflict-affected North East.  \n \n\n                                                 \n40  Para. 108 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. \n\n\fComponents and Outputs \n\nB. \n \n96. \nRehabilitation  subprojects  will  address  (i) community  development,  (ii) civil  works \u2013\n access/rural  roads,  (iii) institutional  infrastructure  and  institutional  strengthening,  and  (iv) civil \nworks \u2013 basic  infrastructure.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  and  prioritized  generally  through  the \nsubproject selection process described in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Development \n\n \n97. \nVillage Development. A wide range of village-level subprojects across several sectors \nwill  restore  livelihoods,  provide  opportunities  for  income  generation,  and  support  reconciliation \nand social cohesion. Livelihood opportunities will be provided in the agricultural sector through \nsubprojects that promote livestock development and market gardening, and provide facilities for \nseed  production.  District  agriculture  centers  will  be  restored  to  assist  farmers.  Skills \ndevelopment  and  training  will  be  provided  for  micro-enterprise  development  in  areas  such  as \nhorticulture, food processing, and tourism. To enable community-based organizations (CBOs) to \npromote micro-enterprises at the village level, revolving funds will be established and managed \nby  CBOs.  Gender-oriented  enterprise  programs,  initiated  as  a  pilot  program  under  the \nNECORD \u2013 Extension  Project,  will  be  expanded  to  cover  a  wider  range  of  coastal  and \nagricultural  communities.  Given  the  influx  of  construction  workers,  an  HIV/AIDS  awareness \ncampaign  will  be  carried  out  among  construction  workers  and  internally  displaced  people. \nNECORD-II  will  also  promote  the  advancement  of  women  at  women\u2019s  industrial  centers,  an \ninitiative begun under the NECORD \u2013 Extension Project.  \n \nShelter. Conflict-affected returnees will be provided shelter at their previous house sites. \n98. \nShelter  reconstruction  will  follow  Government  policy  in  the  selection  of  families  and  the  total \nassistance allowance per family.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCivil Works\u2014Access Roads  \n\n \n99. \nAccess  road  construction  will  use  labor-intensive  methods  to  provide  gravel-surfaced \nrural roads, connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, or community facilities. \nA small number of class C or D provincial roads will be rehabilitated with all-weather surfaces. \nAll  road  construction  will  be  on  existing  alignments  and  is  not  expected  to  require  land \nacquisition or resettlement.  \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Infrastructure  \n\n \n100. \nInfrastructure and Institutional Strengthening. Institutional capacity will be improved \nthrough subprojects that restore or reestablish damaged local government facilities and district \noffices, and rehabilitate courts and registrars\u2019 offices in the North East. Designs for replacement \nfacilities  will  provide  disabled  access.  NECORD-II  will  also  supply  training  to  staff  on  public \nadministration, accounts, and information management. In anticipation of the growing need for \nskilled  employees,  training  will  be  given  to  youths  in  construction,  motor  mechanics,  and \ntourism-related  trades,  and  will  encompass  construction  of  any  special  facilities  required  to \nprovide these trainings.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCivil Works\u2014Basic Infrastructure \n\n \n101.  Health.  Subprojects  will  restore  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \n\n26 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nfurniture,  construction  of  doctor\u2019s  quarters  at  hospital  compounds,  and  rehabilitation  of  village \nhealth clinics.  \n \n102.  Education.  Subprojects  will  restore  services  and  facilities  by  (i) reconstructing  and \nrehabilitating  teaching  facilities  and  school  buildings;  (ii) constructing  cluster  housing  units  for \nteachers on unencumbered lands, in areas where existing housing is limited or unavailable; and \n(iii) providing teacher training in primary education, English, science and math. Training will be \nprovided to improve the quality of the teachers, especially new recruits.  \n \n103.  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  Improvements  will  be  made  to  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities in small and medium-sized towns. These will be linked to village community \ndevelopment activities, particularly where internally displaced persons (IDPs) are returning.  \n \n104. \nIrrigation.  Existing  medium-sized  and  large  irrigation  schemes  will  be  rehabilitated \nthrough restoration of tank bunds, channel systems, access roads, and other structures, without \nchanges  to,  or  diversions  of,  natural  watercourses.  The  activity  will  be  linked  to  the  village, \nagriculture and livestock development.  \n \n105.  Land mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination of proposed subproject sites \nin  the  North  East  is  not  expected  to  be  substantial,  even  after  the  effects  of  the  tsunami. \nAlthough  there  are  a  significant  number  of  landmines  and  UXO  still  uncleared  in  the  North \nEast\u2014contaminated  areas  were  well  defined  prior  to  the  tsunami\u2014most  coastal  areas,  being \ndensely  populated,  had  already  been  priorities  for  mine  and  UXO  clearance.  In  these  areas, \nthere  were  few  mines  left.  Areas  around  military  installations  on  the  coast,  where  mines  were \nconcentrated,  may  have  been  affected  by  the  tsunami,  but  dealing  with  these  is  relatively \nstraightforward,  as  the  number  of  affected  areas  is  small.  Clearance  in  the  tsunami-affected \nareas  is  currently  being  done  by  agencies  already  involved  in  mine  clearance  (e.g.,  the  Sri \nLankan  Army  and  the  HALO  Trust)  and  has  almost  been  completed.  However,  as  a  further \nsafeguard, provisions  for  obtaining  clearance certification of  subproject  sites  in  the  North  East \nwill be incorporated into each civil works contract.  \n \nC. \n \n106.  NECORD-II has been formulated to address urgent basic needs and social services lost \nas  a  result  of  the  20-year  conflict  and  is  therefore,  like  TAARP,  being  processed  under  the \ndisaster policy. NECORD-II will be implemented expeditiously, but extra effort and time will be \ntaken  to  provide  proper  targeting  and  adequate  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  ensure \ncommunity  participation,  and  address  area  resource  capacity  constraints.  NECORD-II \ninterventions  will  generally \nto  appropriate \nreplace  preexisting  assets, \ncontemporary  standards.  Economic  analysis  is  not  required,  but  investments  will  be  made  on \nthe basis of least-cost restoration of pre-existing facilities.  \n \n107.  NECORD-II  takes  a  proactive  stance  towards  the  risks  of  increased  HIV/AIDS41 \ntransmission  by  providing  an  awareness  training  program.  Given  the  recent  increase  in \nconstruction  in  the  North  East\u2014in  particular  for  large-scale  infrastructure  projects  soon  to \nbegin\u2014and  in  cooperation  with  other  HIV/AIDS  programs  already  underway  in  Sri  Lanka,  the \nprogram will focus on workers and their families, who will be educated on the basic facts of HIV \ntransmission and how to protect themselves and their partners, and provided with opportunities \nto discuss the risk of HIV transmission.  \n\nSpecial Features \n\nreconstructed \n\n                                                 \n41  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f28 \n\n108.  NECORD-II  will  expand  the  pilot  gender  enterprise  initiative  started  under  the \nNECORD \u2013 Extension  Project  (footnote  22),  to  promote  the  advancement  of  women  through \neconomic  activities  at  women\u2019s  industrial  centers.  Consultants  will  provide  guidance  on \nestablishing  the  centers,  which  will  be  formed  by  women\u2019s  groups.  NECORD-II  will  build  on \nexisting district women's rural development societies and involve women\u2019s NGOs, which will be \nidentified at the implementation stage.  \n \n109.  NECORD-II  has  many  of  the  same  governance  features  as  TAARP  (refer  to  Appendix \n8). \n \nD. \n \n110.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $55.0 million.  Loan  financing  of  $26.0 million \nequivalent is composed of $10.6 million in foreign exchange and $15.4 million equivalent in local \ncurrency  costs.  Table  4  contains  a  summary  cost  estimate.  Appendix 9b  contains  detailed \nproject costs and the financing plan for NECORD-II.  \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable 4: NECORD-II Cost Estimatesa \n($ million)  \n\nItem \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nTotal\n\nGrant: \n1.

The Government has asked that ADB finance the cost of the activities to be undertaken \nunder the scope of NECORD\u2013II except for duties, taxes, and incremental expenditures, with a \nloan not exceeding $26 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and a grant of \n$14 million from the eighth replenishment of the ADF. The Borrower will be the Government of \nSri Lanka. These funds will be used entirely for rehabilitation and other programs proposed in \nthe conflict-affected areas of the North East. A single financing agreement will govern both the \nloan and the ADF grant for NECORD-II.  \n \n112.  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  has  expressed  its \nwillingness  to  provide  SKr40  million  on  a  grant  basis  to  finance  100%  of  the  cost,  excluding \nduties and taxes, of rehabilitating provincial and rural roads in the North East under NECORD-II. \nIf  approved  by  the  Government  of  Sweden,  the  Sida  Grant  will  be  provided  through,  and \nadministered by, ADB in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon between Sida \nand the ADB. A breakdown of the financing plan is presented in Table 5.  \n113.  The  provisions  set  forth  in  para.  56  for  accepting  cofinancing  for  TAARP  after  Board \napproval  are  also  requested  for  any  additional  cofinancing  for  NECORD-II,  and  would  be \njustified on the same basis.  \n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Fund Grant a \nAsian Development Fund Loan \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Sri Lanka \nGovernment of Sweden \n\nTable 5: NECORD-II Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n10.6 \n\n \n0 \n \n\n \n15.4 \n\n \n9.1 \n \n\n \nTotal \n\n14.0 \n26.0 \n\n40.0 \n9.1 \n5.9 \n\n55.0 \n\n \n% \n\n25.4 \n47.3 \n\n72.7 \n16.6 \n10.7 \n\n100 \n\nTotal \n\n18.2 \n\n36.8 \n\nNECORD = North East Community Restoration and Development Project.  \na  Grant financing does not distinguish between foreign exchange and local currency.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n \n\nJustification for Special Loan Terms and Grants \n\n1. \n\nADF Loan  \n\n \n114.  Sri  Lanka  is  recovering  from  conflict  and  making  the  transition  to  peace  and  stability. \nADB's disaster policy modifies the prevailing ADF lending terms approved by the ADB Board so \nthey  are  appropriate  for  disaster,  emergency,  and  post-conflict  assistance.  The  disaster  policy \ncovers  post-conflict  assistance  and  provides  that  emergency  assistance  loans  are  to  cover \nshort-term  immediate  needs  including  rehabilitation  of  priority  water,  transport,  and  other \ninfrastructure,  to  regenerate  livelihoods  and  boost  productivity,  and  revitalize  social  services, \namong  other  things  (footnote  9).  The  ADF  loan  would  be  extended  to  Sri  Lanka  to  cover  a \nportion  of  the  remaining  unfunded  immediate  term  needs  identified  in  the  2003  post-conflict \nneeds  assessment  and  still  unmet  (refer  to  paragraph  12  for  the  description  of  these  needs), \nlivelihoods,  boosting \nincluding \n\nrehabilitation  of  priority \n\nregeneration  of \n\ninfrastructure, \n\n\f30 \n\nproductivity, and revitalizing social services. It is proposed that the loan from ADF be made on \nconcessional  terms  permitted  under  ADB's  disaster  policy,  and  the  same  as  the  Approved \nLoans.  The  term  of  the  loan  will  be  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  with  a \nrepayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year \nthereafter, to be paid semiannually, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum.  \n \n\n2. \n\nADF Grant \n\n \n115.  The  Board  of  Governors  of  ADB  resolved  to  establish  a  new  grant  program  during  the \nAsian Development Fund IX Annual Meeting, under the ADF IX resolution42. Donors agreed that \nADF  grants  could  be  used  to  assist  poor  countries  make  the  transition  from  post-conflict  to \npeace and stability, as well as for HIV/AIDS prevention. Sri Lanka was identified as one of the \npost-conflict countries and eligible for ADF grants43. The post-conflict situation in the North East \nof  Sri  Lanka  qualifies  Sri  Lanka  for  such  ADF  grant  funding.  In  addition,  the  HIV/AIDS \nsubcomponent  qualifies  for  ADF  grant  financing,  although,  as  it  is  not  a  large  subcomponent, \nwill be financed through the post-conflict country allocation of the ADF grant.  \n \nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n116.  NECORD-II will be implemented using the same process approach and implementation \narrangements  as  NECORD  that  are  already  working  successfully.  NECORD\u2019s  PMU  in \nTrincomalee will be strengthened and maintained for the duration of NECORD-II. The PMU will \nbe headed by the project director, who will have direct responsibility for implementing NECORD-\nII, through the existing provincial and central government sector agencies, and for ensuring that \nthe  essential  balances  among  communities  are  monitored  and  maintained.  The  PMU  will \nmanage  and  coordinate  subprojects  through  existing  structures  and  procedures  at  provincial, \ndistrict, and division levels. The PMU will act as the secretariat for NPCC and PPCC. The PMU \nmay  engage  suitably  qualified  and  acceptable  international  and  domestic  NGOs  to  manage \nspecific NECORD-II activities in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. District project \nmanagement units (DPMUs) established in each district under NECORD will continue to closely \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  district  subprojects  and  report  to  the  PMU.  A  deputy  project \ndirector,  who  will  directly  implement  smaller-scale  subprojects  at  the  district  and  divisional \nlevels, will head each DPMU. \n \n117.  Given the complexity and sensitivity of NECORD-II and the need for close coordination \nwith the actors in the North East\u2014the Government, LTTE, external assistance agencies, NGOs, \nand others\u2014NECORD-II will be administered through the ADB Resident Mission in Colombo.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSelection and Approval of Subprojects \n\n \n118.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  to  ensure  equitable  distribution  of  rehabilitation  activities \nacross  all  the  conflict-affected  districts\u2014taking  into  account  geographic  and  sector  balances \nalong  with  the  ethnic  composition\u2014to  maximize  benefits  in  the  affected  areas  and,  equally \nimportant,  to  not  contribute  to  the  intercommunal  tensions  that  led  to  the  conflict.  NECORD-II \n\n                                                 \n42  Eighth  Replenishment  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  Third  Regularized  Replenishment  of  the  Technical \n\nAssistance Special Fund\" (ADF IX Resolution) \n\n43 Paragraph 24 of the ADF Staff Instructions Program,  November  2004. ADF grants  are  not to exceed  15%  of Sri \n\nLanka\u2019s program.  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nsubprojects  will  be  identified  and  selected  in  accordance  with  sector-specific  criteria  agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB, as presented in Appendix 5b. In addition, regardless of the \nsector, each subproject proposal will be selected on the basis of the general criteria set forth in \npara. 70, except that such criteria will be defined in terms of conflict affected people and conflict-\naffected areas, rather than in terms of the tsunami.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n119.  Like  TAARP,  NECORD-II  will  be  implemented  over  a  4-year  period.  This  period  is \nneeded  because  of  the  geographic  distribution  and  extent  of  damage  caused  by  the  20-year \nconflict,  the  time  required  to  formulate  and  package  subprojects  and  civil  works  contracts,  the \nnecessity for community consultation and mobilization, the potential need for clearance of mines \nand  unexploded  ordnance,  and  the  limitations  of  still  evolving  institutions.  Capacity  building  at \nthe  various  implementing  departments  and  the  construction  industry  in  the  North  East  has \nbegun\u2014in part through the NECORD subprojects already completed\u2014but the need for further \ncapacity building remains. Contractor capacity has been strengthened in the North East through \na series of construction and contracting seminars presented in 2004 by Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  and  ADB.  Equally  important,  the  conflict  destroyed \nmuch  of  the  human  capacity  in  the  area,  in  the  Government,  NGOs,  and  the  private  sector. \nNECORD-II will continue the essential but time- and resource-consuming task of rebuilding this \ncapacity.  The  existing  national  project  coordinating  committee  and  provincial  project \ncoordinating  committee  will  continue  to  operate  under  NECORD-II.  The  scheduled  completion \ndate is 30 June 2009, the same as for TAARP (Appendix 11).  \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Environmental Measures \n\n \n120.  Like TAARP, NECORD-II is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement; only \nvacant  state-owned  land  will  be  used  for  subproject  improvements.  Reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation will typically take place at existing locations. Works will be designed to ensure that \nimprovements  will  be  within  existing  property  boundaries.  If  constructed,  cluster-housing  units \nfor teachers will be located only at or adjacent to existing education facilities, on unencumbered \ngovernment  land.  A  summary  resettlement  framework  as  presented  in  Appendix 12,  has  been \nagreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  to  address  any  unanticipated  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement that may arise during NECORD-II. Refer to paragraph 72 above. \n \n121.  Like  TAARP  (para.  73),  NECORD-II  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of \npreexisting  infrastructure  damaged  as  a  result  of  the  conflict,  and  is  also  classified  as \nenvironmental  category  B.  No  subprojects  classified  as  category  A  by  ADB  will  be  financed \nunder  NECORD-II.  A  summary  IEE  is  presented  in  Appendix 13.  Subprojects  will  follow \nenvironmental  assessment  procedures  stipulated  in  the  environmental  assessment  framework \nattached  as  Appendix 14.  While  NECORD-II  may  lead  to  temporary  and  reversible  localized \nnegative \nforeseen.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  framework  has  been  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and the Government\u2019s environmental regulations.  \n \n122.  The  indigenous  Veddas  may  also  be  affected  by  NECORD-II.  In  the  event  of  their \ninvolvement  in  any  subprojects,  all  necessary  actions  required  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) and the IPDF will be taken, as similarly detailed for TAARP in para. \n74. A summary IPDF is presented in Appendix 15.  \n \n \n\nimpacts,  no  significant  adverse  environmental \n\nimpacts  are \n\n\f5. \n\nProcurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n\n \n123.  Procurement of goods and services under NECORD-II will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  disaster  policy  permits  flexible  interpretation  of  these  guidelines,  so  that  project \nactivities can start promptly.  \n \n124.  For civil works contracts with estimated values greater than $5 million, procurement will \nbe  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  with \nestimated  values  of  $5 million  and  below,  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Local  procurement  will  be  the \npreferred  mode  for  most  NECORD-II  activities  because  of  the  relatively  short  implementation \nperiod, the relatively small size of most contract packages, the wide geographic spread of the \nsubproject  sites,  and  the  need  for  local  awareness  of  security  and  other  frequently  changing \nmatters relevant to the North East. Contracts with estimated values less than $100,000 will be \nprocured under LCB using post-facto approval procedures, as is currently typical for NECORD. \nLCB civil works procurement will include single-stage, two-envelope procedures where relevant, \nand bidding periods of at least 21 days.  \n \n125.  Equipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  by  international  shopping  where  the \nestimated  cost  is  between  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through  local  procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n126.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  procurement  of \ncivil  works,  including  inviting  and  receiving  bids  for  contracts,  for  subprojects  that  might  be \napproved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing NECORD-II.  \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n127.  The  existing  consultants  for  NECORD,  who  are  providing  support  for  procurement, \ncontract  management,  and  training,  will  extend  their  services  through direct  selection  to  cover \nthe  additional  requirements  of  NECORD-II.  For  new  services,  primarily  for  accounting  and \ngeneral  engineering,  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Consultants  will  be  provided  individually  and  through \nfirms. Individual consultants will assist in the preparation of gender-oriented economic activities \nand  business  cooperatives.  NGOs  will  assist  during  implementation  of  village  and  community \ndevelopment  subprojects.  NECORD-II  will  require  approximately  200  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  Sample  outline  terms  of  reference  for  potential  consultant \nassignments are provided in Appendix 16.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n128.  Disbursement  arrangements  will  follow  the  existing  fund  flow  and  disbursement \narrangements  established  and  working  well  at  the  existing  NECORD  PMU  and  DPMUs. \nDetailed disbursements arrangements for NECORD-II are in Appendix 17.  \n \n \n\n32 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n33\n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n129.  The  MRRR,  NEPC,  and  the  PMU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the \nloan  and  grant  adequate  to  identify  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for \nNECORD-II,  including  goods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  loan,  grant,  and  local  funds. \nThese project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Provision  for \nfinancial  auditing  costs  has  been  included  in  the  cost  estimate  and  will  be  financed  through \nNECORD-II.  The  Government  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial \nstatements  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  audit  of  imprest \naccounts, second-generation imprest accounts, third-generation imprest accounts, and SOE will \nbe carried out as part of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s opinion of each separately set out in \nthe  auditor\u2019s  report.  Like  for  TAARP,  financial  audits  provided  in  6  months  by  private  sector \nauditors  may  be  provided  in  advance  of  the  Sri  Lankan  Auditor  General\u2019s  statutory  audited \naccounts, and if there is any discrepancy, ADB and Sri Lanka will consult on the reasons for this \nand next steps to be followed.  \n \n130.  The PMU currently prepares brief progress reports for NECORD each month. NECORD-\nII  activities  will  be  similarly  reported  in  separate  monthly  reports.  Completion  reports,  which \nidentify  the  impact  of  activities,  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject.  Within  3  months  of  the \nphysical  completion  of  NECORD-II,  the  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  an  overall  project \ncompletion  report  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  contractor  and \nconsultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as may be requested by \nADB.  \n \n131.  As required by the disaster policy, supervision and monitoring of NECORD-II has been \nenhanced  to  ensure  quality  and  effectiveness  at  a  time  when  the  Government\u2019s  financial  and \nhuman  resources  are  extended  (footnote  37).  Procurement  specialists  will  help  the  National \nProcurement  Agency  to  expedite  civil  works  and  equipment  procurement  procedures  and \nrefining guidelines. In addition, independent auditors, CSOs, or NGOs will conduct semiannual \nperformance audits during implementation, to determine the degree to which NECORD-II funds \nhave  been  effectively  and  efficiently  utilized  during  implementation,  and  whether  objectives, \noutputs,  and  performance  indicators  have  been  achieved.  The  final  performance  audit  (to  be \nconducted after completion) will focus on governance, financial accountability, and transparency \n(footnote 38). Provision has been included in the cost estimates to cover performance auditing \nthroughout implementation. The Government will be responsible for covering the cost of the final \npost completion performance audit.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n132.  For  activities  where  subprojects  are  formulated  and  designed  during  implementation, \nbaseline  indicators  and  targets  for  each  subproject,  including  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of \nthe  beneficiaries,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  subproject  proposal.  The  management \ninformation  system  developed  for  NECORD\u2014in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance \nmanagement evaluation system\u2014will be updated and used to monitor subproject benefits and \nimpacts for NECORD-II.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n133.  NECORD-II  will  be  regularly  reviewed  by  the  Resident  Mission  (at  least  once  every  6 \nmonths) throughout project implementation. There will also be quarterly reviews as part of the \n\n\f34 \n\n \n \n\noverall  portfolio  review.  Resident  Mission  staff  will  attend  NPCC  and  PPCC  meetings  in  the \nNorth East to consider and approve subprojects for implementation. Given the complexities of \nimplementation  involved  and  considering  the  4-year  implementation  period,  a  midterm  review \nwill  be  carried  out  after  2  years,  around  June  2007,  for  which  the  Government  will  submit  to \nADB a detailed progress report on the implementation and achievement of NECORD-II.  \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECTS\u2019 BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProjects\u2019 Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n134.  The  vast  majority  of  the  people  directly  affected  by  the  tsunami  disaster  were  at  the \nlower  end  of  the  economic  scale,44  partly  because  the  districts  affected  tended  to  have  high \nlevels of poverty at the time of the disaster and partly because people who lived in substandard \nhousing were less able to resist the onslaught of the waves. In the conflict-affected North East, \npoverty  levels  are  estimated  to  be  60%\u201390%,  much  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country, \nalthough  there  are  gaps  in  government  surveys  for  much  of  the  area.  For  both  tsunami-  and \nconflict-affected  people,  basic  socioeconomic  facilities  need  to  be  restored  if  affected \ncommunities  are  to  recover  and  begin  the  long  climb  back  to  normalcy.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is provided as Appendix 18.  \n \n135.  These projects together will address the urgent needs of about 3 million people, among \nwhich the physically disabled, single heads of households and children feature significantly. By \nrestoring sectors that form the backbone of the economy in the affected areas, NECORD-II will \nhelp  to  rebuild  affected  communities,  and  to  stabilize  the  economic  base  of  local  populations, \nhelping people to move from dependency on government support to sustainable livelihoods.  \n \n136.  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  focus  on  restoring  preexisting  facilities,  allowing  for  technical \nimprovements  and  future  demand,  based  on  a  least-cost  approach.  TAARP  also  aims  to \nstrengthen the coastal environment. Taking into consideration the long years of neglect, project \ninterventions focus not only on the physical rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure but also on \nthe  restoration  of  the  physical  and  institutional  arrangements  for  legal,  administrative  and \ntechnical services.  \n \n137.  Creating an environment that is conducive for vulnerable and marginalized groups in the \nconflict- and tsunami-affected areas to participate in reconstruction activities is an urgent need. \nConflict widows, wives of the \u201cdisappeared,\u201d single heads of households, and widowers have to \ndeal  with  transformations  in  social  roles  that  place  new  burdens  on  them.  Helping  them  to \nbecome  economically  independent  and  to  improve  the  well-being  of  their  families  involves \nreduce existing inequalities and discrimination. To this end, a gender action plan is presented in \nAppendix 19.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n44  Statistics on families affected have not yet been disaggregated according to income levels. This assertion is based \non impressions gathered during several ADB field trips to the affected areas and on monitoring reports by various \naid  agencies.  Poverty  levels  in  the  affected  districts  are  higher  than  the  national  average  (head  count  ratio  of \n22.7%)  with  a  head  count  ratio  of  over  35%  in  each  of  the  Southern  districts  (Galle  26%,  Matara  27%  and \nHambantota 32%). Poverty statistics are not available for the North East, but can be expected to be higher due to \nthe 20-year conflict.  \n\n\f \n\n35\n\nAssumptions, Risks, and Mitigants  \n\nthrough  grant  resources.  New  subprojects  must  satisfy \n\nB. \n \n138.  The design of TAARP and NECORD-II incorporates a number of safeguards to improve \nand strengthen governance and institutional capacity of the EAs, the IAs, and the PMUs.  \n \n139.  There  is  a  risk  that  either  or  both  projects  may  not  be  sustainable.  However,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  contribution  is  primarily  through  reallocation  of  existing  budget  provision  and \nplanned  budgetary  allocation  for  the  NECORD-II  project,  therefore  the  additional  finances \nrequired  are  limited.  Further,  given  the  situation  after  the  tsunami,  Government  financing  is \nlimited to incremental expenditures, duties and taxes; all other components of both projects are \n100% financed by other sources, so, except for the loan of $26 million for NECORD-II, there is \nno increase in the debt burden. Except for component A of TAARP, TAARP and NECORD-II are \nbeing implemented through PMUs established under existing loan agreements; additional staff \nare  being  provided \nfinancial \nsustainability  criteria,  and,  as  both  projects  involve  replacing  old,  and  in  some  cases, \ndepreciated  assets,  there  is  a  possibility  of  incremental  operations  and  maintenance  savings. \nTAARP and NECORD-II are therefore deemed to be financially sustainable.  \n \n140. \nIn  responding  to  the  tsunami,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  financial  and  human  capacities  are  being \nstrained.  The  volume  and  scale  of  tsunami-related  foreign  assistance  being  provided  to  Sri \nLanka  could  lead  to  governance,  corruption,  and  administration  of  justice  issues.  The  size  of \npublic  and  private  contributions  to  Sri  Lanka  may  exceed  the  current  capacity  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  public  administration  and  justice  systems  to  manage  the  funds,  leaving \nopportunities for individuals and public officials to take advantage of the large influx of funds and \nvulnerable people.  \n \n141.  Factors mitigating governance and corruption risks include detailed subproject selection \ncriteria, transparent implementation and monitoring mechanisms, specific financial controls and \nregular  and  random  audits.  Additional  budget  provisions  for  supervision  and  monitoring, \nparticularly  by  Resident  Mission  staff  will  also  serve  to  strengthen  governance  controls.  In \naddition,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  for  procurement,  financial  management,  supervision  and \nmonitoring has been assessed and will be further strengthened through TAARP. In addition to \nthe usual submission of annual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB, regular \nand random supervision and monitoring reviews will be undertaken. Provision has been made in \nboth  projects  for  independent  annual  financial  audits  and  regular  performance  audits.  The \nResident Mission is also strengthening its ability to supervise and provide guidance and training \nto PMUs. A decentralized system of private dispute resolution, and public grievance review, will \nbe  established  under  TAARP  to  investigate  and  resolve  any  private  disputes  or  claims  of \nimpropriety against public officials relating to tsunami assistance. Manual systems of document \nstorage  and  retrieval  for  personal  identity  documents  will  be  modernized  to  minimize  risks  of \nfalse claims and corruption. Publication of tsunami assistance, procurement, and tsunami policy \nmatters in all three languages (Sinhala, Tamil and English), in government newspapers and on \na  web-site,  will  provide  the  public  with  information  and  so  improve  transparency  and \naccountability.  Legal  assistance  will be  provided  to  tsunami-affected  people  to  enable  them  to \navail of their legal entitlements for good governance, and to minimize disputes.  \n \n142.  Provision of significant assistance to tsunami-affected people can produce tensions if it \nis perceived that different parts of the country or ethnic groups are receiving more than their fair \nshare of reconstruction funds, or if other people who are in poverty or internally displaced feel \nthey  are  being  forgotten.  As  a  result,  social  tensions  and  conflict  can  actually  increase, \nundermining implementation of reconstruction.  \n\n\f143.  The  peace  and  conflict  impact  assessment  is  available  as  Supplementary  Appendix D. \nBy fitting in the general framework of the national reconstruction plan, both projects will ensure \nthat  overall  allocation  of  funds  to  the  affected  areas  follows  reconstruction  needs  and  that  the \nsame  criteria  and  policies  are  applied  to  tsunami-  and  conflict-affected  areas.  In  addition, \nsubproject  selection  will  ensure  that  the  beneficial  outcomes  are  shared  equitably  among  the \nmajor ethnic groups and across the target area. Both projects will make a positive contribution \nto strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of the affected areas by rebuilding key infrastructure. \nEquity  and  conflict  resolution  will  be  pursued  through  (i) selection  of  communities  and \nsubprojects to ensure an ethnic balance that reasonably reflects the general ethnic composition \nof  the  affected  areas;  (ii) consultation  with  all  major  stakeholders  regarding  the  final  choice  of \nsubprojects;  and  (iii) consistent  application  of  the  principle  of  subsidiarity,  to  ensure  that \nrecovery decisions are taken as close as possible to the affected populations, with their active \ninvolvement as stakeholders in the process.  \n \n144.  The bureaucratic application of normal implementation procedures could result in delays \nin the rehabilitation and reconstruction of tsunami-affected areas. Disputes relating to property \nrights  caused  by  loss  of  title  documents,  shifting  of  shorelines,  occupation  of  private  lands  by \nsquatters,  elimination  of  property  boundaries,  and  resettlement  of  displaced  people  may  also \ncause delays.  \n \n145.  To  address  these  risks,  ADB  is  assisting  the  National  Procurement  Agency  to  simplify \nthe  emergency  procurement  guidelines  and  the  procurement  guidelines  for  Sri  Lanka.  TAARP \nwill engage consultants to support procurement and the planning and evaluation of subprojects, \nas requested by the Government. Existing PMUs will be used to implement the project, avoiding \nthe time needed to establish new ones. They will be strengthened by adding capacity to ensure \nno  delays  in  implementation  or  processing  of  payments.  Retroactive  financing  has  been \nincluded  so  urgent  activities  can  be  funded.  The  legal  assistance  and  governance  measures \nmentioned above will minimize the risk of legal and documentary related disputes.  \n \n146.  Another  risk  is  that,  once  a  period  of  time  has  passed,  the  national  Government  or \nprovincial  and  local  governments  may  not  maintain  sufficient  commitment  to  implement  both \nprojects in an efficient and timely manner.  \n \n147.  The Government has established TAFREN, involving high-caliber members from private \nand public sectors. It is preparing a bill to be submitted to parliament to transform TAFREN into \nan Authority that will coordinate reconstruction over a 3 to 5 year period. Reconstruction under \nTAARP  will  be  undertaken  within  this  national  framework,  while  special  mechanisms  and \nagreements are being developed for affected districts in the North East, to ensure participation \nand commitment by all stakeholders.  \n \n148.  Competition  among  donors  offering  assistance  and  insufficient  coordination  in  the \nprovision of assistance could lead to gaps or overlaps in sector or geographic coverage, poor \ndelivery of needed benefits to tsunami-affected people, or the application of different policies or \nstandards in different areas.  \n \n149.  A  good  climate  for  cooperation  has  been  established  through  the  tsunami  needs \nassessment.  In  the  second  phase  of  the  assessment,  which  is  focusing  on  implementation \nmechanisms  and  coordination,  the  steering  group  has  been  expanded  to  include  bilateral \ndevelopment partners, NGOs, and the private sector. While coordinating the international NGOs \nthat have raised large cash contributions will be a challenge, a good basis for cooperation has \nbeen  laid.  The  Government  is  leading  the  second  phase  of  the  needs  assessment,  and  has \n\n36 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n37\n\nindicated its intention to play a strong role in coordination, including listing all significant projects \non the TAFREN website. ADB, JBIC, and the World Bank are working closely together, taking \nturns to chair reconstruction-related meetings. ADB and the World Bank have explicitly declared \nthat they will make their reconstruction operations flexible, in order to play a \u201cgap-filling\u201d role to \ncomplement other development partners.  \n \n150.  Price  escalation  is  a  risk.  An  increase  in  the  demand  for  construction  materials  in  an \nalready  constrained  supply  environment  could  lead  to  price  escalation  and  dramatically  affect \nthe amount of reconstruction that can be carried out under either project. An adequate supply of \nconstruction  materials  (sand,  cement,  reinforcing  steel)  must  be  readily  accessible  to  the \nconstruction industry, in particular in the North East, where there is already a large construction \nprogram underway.  \n \n151.  The  possibility  of  rising  prices  has  been  raised  in  a  number  of  meetings  with  the \nGovernment,  and  mitigating  measures  are  being  designed.  Selective  import  liberalization  and \nspreading  implementation  over  a  longer  period  (up  to  4  years,  depending  on  urgency  of \ninterventions) will help to smooth out pressures on supply.  \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nSPECIFIC ASSURANCES \n\n \n152.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  relevant  to  both  TAARP  and \nNECORD-II,  in  addition  to  the  standard  assurances.  These  have  been  incorporated  into  the \nlegal documents.  \n \n\nContinuity  and  integration.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  continuity  of  the \nimplementation  of  NECORD  and  NECORD \u2013 Extension  on  the  one  hand,  and \nComponent  H  of  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  on  the  other,  and  will  ensure  the \nintegration of the implementation of NECORD-II and Component H of TAARP. \n\n \n\nGovernment administration. The project management arrangements reflect the \npresent  Government  administrative  structure \nthat  may  change  during \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  immediately  notify  ADB  of  any  proposed \nchange  in  the  administrative  structure  in  the  project  areas,  and  take  all  steps \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  the  project  management  arrangements  are  revised  in \nconsultation with ADB to reflect the new administrative structure and protect the \nviability  of  the  Project(s).  The  Government  will  take  all  steps  necessary  and \nwithin its power to ensure that any successor project management entities enter \ninto  such  project  agreements,  or  other  agreements  with  ADB,  as  ADB  may \nrequest.  \n \nPeace  building  and  community  reconciliation.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  all  conflict-related  project  interventions  contribute  to  peace  building  and \ncommunity reconciliation, and that all tsunami-related project interventions either \nfrom,  peace  building  and  community \ncontribute \nreconciliation. If any intervention has an actual or threatened negative impact on \npeace  building  and  community,  the  Government  agrees  that  ADB  shall  be \nentitled to determine whether such intervention should be continued, redesigned, \nsuspended, or cancelled.  \n \n\nto,  or  do  not  detract \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAccess. The Government will ensure that staff, consultants, materials, vehicles, \nequipment,  and  other  items  required  for  project  implementation,  will  be  given \nreasonable access to project areas.  \n \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  the \nexecuting  agencies,  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure,  that  the  facilities \nprovided  under  the  Project  are  operated  and  maintained,  and  that  adequate \nbudgetary  and  other  resources  are  provided  for  this  purpose.  The  Government \nwill also ensure that community-based organizations charged with operating and \nmaintaining  facilities  provided  under  both  projects  are  provided  with  the \nnecessary support and training to undertake such activities.  \n \nSubproject  selection.  The  Government  and  each  Implementing  Agency  will \nensure  that  all  subprojects  meet  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction,  the  agreed  selection \ncriteria  and  other  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  subprojects  are \ncontrolled and monitored to ADB\u2019s satisfaction.  \n \n\n(vii)  Governance  and  anticorruption.  The  Government  and  ADB  agree  to  adopt  a \npolicy of zero-tolerance of corruption in relation to assistance provided under the \nProject(s), and by development partners. The Government will take measures to \nquickly  sanction  private  individuals,  entities,  or  public  officials  who  actually,  or \nattempt to take advantage of donor funds, or the loss of documents, such as the \nabsence of property title documents, court records, or bank accounts.  \n \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  SOE audit. The Government agrees to ensure that ADB staff are granted access \nto key books and records in order to complete an SOE audit within 6 months of \neffectiveness.  \n \nPerformance  audits.  The  Government  will,  and  will  cause  each  Executing \nAgency or Implementing Agency to, engage private sector auditors, civil society \norganizations  (CSOs),  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  conduct \nsemiannual performance audits during Project implementation, to determine the \ndegree  to  which  Project  funds  have  been  effectively  and  efficiently  utilized  to \nimplement  the  Project,  and  achieved  its  objectives,  outputs,  and  performance \nindicators. In addition, the Government will ensure that a special post completion \nperformance  audit  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  disaster  and \nfinancial \nemergency  policy \naccountability.  \n \nADB  monitoring  and  compliance.  The  Government  will  allow  and  facilitate \nADB\u2019s  representatives  to  conduct  spot  and  random  checks  on  (a)  flow  of  funds \nthrough the imprest account, each second-generation imprest account, and each \nthird-generation imprest account, and their use for the project in accordance with \nthe financing agreement, (b) work-in-progress; and (c) project implementation. \n \nParticipation. The Government will ensure, or will cause each Executing Agency \nor  Implementing  Agency  to  ensure  that  CSOs,  NGOs,  and  beneficiaries  are \ninvolved in subproject selection, design, implementation, and monitoring.  \n\nto  consider  governance, \n\ntransparency,  and \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n \n153. \nto the standard assurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents.  \n\nIn addition, the Government has given the following assurances for TAARP, in addition \n\n38 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n39\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nBribery  and  Corruption  commission.

from  tsunami  damage  or  destruction  are \n1. \nestimated at $1.5 billion\u2013$1.6 billion. This is in addition to the $200 million\u2013$300 million that the \nGovernment  estimates  it  has  already  spent,  and  excludes  further  relief  expenditures.  In  the \nshort term, most resources are required for housing, transportation infrastructure, and livelihood \nrestoration for fishers, small farmers, small and microenterprises, and others. Recovery needs \nrun parallel to the level of damage, with some variation, depending upon the recovery strategy \nand its intent to replace damaged assets with those of equal value, as in housing and health, or \nwith  upgrades  to  services  and  infrastructure,  as  in  power,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and \ntransportation (especially railways).  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Preliminary Estimates of Losses and Financing Needs  \n($ million) \n\n \n \n\nSector \nHousing \nRoads \nWater and Sanitation \nRailways \nEducation \nHealth \nAgriculture a \nFisheries a \nTourism a \nPower \nEnvironment \nSocial Welfare b \nExcluded Items plus \nContingency c \n\nLosses \n\nAsset \nLoss \n306\u2013341 \n60 \n42 \n15 \n26 \n60 \n3 \n97 \n250 \n10 \n10 \n\u2013 \n\nOutput \nLossd \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n200 \n130 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\nShort \nTerm \n50 \n25 \n64 \n40 \n13 \n17 \n2 \n69 \n130 \n27 \n6 \n30 \n\n30 \n\nFinancing Needs \nMedium  \nTerm \n387\u2013437 \n175 \n53 \n90 \n32 \n67 \n2 \n49 \n0 \n40\u201350 \n12 \n0 \n\nTotal  \nNeeds \n437\u2013487 \n200 \n117 \n130 \n45 \n84 \n4 \n118 \n130 \n67\u201377 \n18 \n30 \n\n150 \n\n90 \n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\nTotal (Rounded) \n\n970\u20131,000 \n\n330 \n\n500 \n\n1,000\u20131,100 \n\n1,500\u20131,600 \n\nPercent of Gross Domestic \nProduct \n\u2013 = not applicable. \na  Includes  estimates  from  livelihoods  damage  assessment  of  fishermen,  small  farmers,  and  small  businesses  in \n\n7.0\u20137.3 \n\n4.4\u20134.6 \n\n1.5 \n\n \n\n \n\ntourism, totaling $140 million. \n\nb Targeted assistance to vulnerable groups. \nc Estimated at about 10% of the total. \nd Refers to 2005 and 2006. \nSource: Government of Sri Lanka and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nThe  assessment  report  emphasizes  the  need  to  take  into  account  guiding  principles\u2014\n2. \nsuch  as  conflict  sensitivity,  subsidiarity,  community  empowerment,  transparency,  hazard  risk \nmanagement,  and  coordination  between  stakeholders\u2014during \nthe  development  of  a \ncomprehensive recovery strategy.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n51\n\nDamage and Needs by Region \n\nB. \n \n3. \nFigures  A2.1  and  A2.2  provide  a  regional  breakdown  of  the  estimated  post-tsunami \nfinancing needs in Sri Lanka. This first does not include the tourism sector,1 since it is likely to \nget financing from the private banking and insurance sectors and, therefore, is not considered \ndependent  on  aid.  The  second  provides  the  full  picture  of  required  financing  from  all  sources. \nThe east is the most heavily affected area, accounting for well over 40% of the financing needs. \nThe Galle district is very heavily impacted, and close to 30% of the financing needs under either \ndefinition  are  in  the  Southern  Province.  Similarly,  the  north  has  about  20%  of  the  damage.

The  recovery  strategy  should  take  into  account  the  extent  of  progress  in  Sri \nLanka  since  the  signing  of  the  cease-fire  agreement,  after  a  long  conflict,  and  seek  to \nstrengthen  the  peace  process.  Reconstruction  interventions  should  build  confidence  between \ndifferent  actors  in  the  process.  Reconstruction  should  similarly  be  sensitive  to  the  impact  on \nneighboring but unaffected communities.  \n \n2. \nThe  strategy  should  be  based  on  the  principle  of  subsidiarity:  each  reconstruction \nactivity should be designed and implemented at the lowest competent tier of government. While \nthe  central  Government  should  lead  in  setting  standards,  policies,  and  principles,  subsidiarity \nallows  for  locally  appropriate  solutions  and  enables  a  range  of  subnational  structures  and \norganizations  to  be  directly  engaged  in  the  process.  The  recovery  plan  (which  should  be \ndisaggregated  to  district  level)  will  provide  for  capacity  building  and  strengthening  at  various \nlevels  of  governance,  but  especially  in  the  districts  and  pradeshiya  sabhas,1  as  well  as  local \ncivil-society organizations.  \n \n3. \nThe  recovery  strategy  should  focus  on  the  victims\u2019  medium-  and  long-term  needs. \nTherefore, enhanced and solid consultation with affected communities and stakeholders is \nessential, and communities should be empowered to make their own decisions during recovery \nand  participate  fully  in  reconstruction  activities.  All  interventions  need  to  respond  to  clearly \nidentified and articulated needs of communities, respecting their religion, culture, structures, and \ncustoms.  This  is  especially  important  with  respect  to  the  policies  related  to  shelter  and \nrelocation,  which  should  not  proceed  without  such  full  consultation.  Communities  should  be \nassisted  to  return  to  their  original  homes  as  swiftly  as  possible.  To  maximize  the  speed  of \nrecovery, local capacities should be harnessed as far as possible.  \n \n4. \nBetter  communication  and  transparency  are  needed  in  decision  making  and \nimplementation. Mechanisms should be strengthened to ensure access to information regarding \npolicies, entitlements, and implementation procedures, and to permit more regular feedback to \nimplementing  authorities,  as  well  as  grievance  redress.  Similarly,  mechanisms  to  ensure \ntransparency  in  resource  use  and  comprehensive  accounting  need  to  be  enhanced,  at  the \naggregate,  program,  and  beneficiary  levels,  accompanied  by  more  effective  monitoring  and \nevaluation  systems,  to  permit  a  full  accounting  to  Parliament,  development  partners,  civil \nsociety, and the affected communities of resources deployed from all sources. All parties should \nreaffirm their policy of zero tolerance for corruption in this joint effort.  \n \n5. \nReconstruction  processes  should  reduce  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards,  including \nfloods,  cyclones,  and  landslides.  A  multi-hazard  risk  approach  should  be  used  during  the \nrecovery  phase  to  ensure  that  communities  and  assets  are  less  vulnerable  to  impacts  of \ndisasters,  while  balancing  the  social  costs  of  excessive  resettlement.  It  should  be  guided  by \ninternational standards and best practices in design and asset management.  \n \n6. \nAll the above considerations suggest a number of factors that will need to be built into \nthe analysis of individual interventions. They should be analyzed for their potential impact on \nthe  cease-fire  and  the  prospects  for  peace.  For  long-term  sustainability,  such  interventions \nshould incorporate governance, gender sensitivity, environment, resettlement and land issues, \n\n                                                 \n1   Local government authority responsible for planning and maintenance at the community level.  \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n55\n\nIf  debt  relief  is  granted  to  Sri  Lanka  as  part  of  the  financing  package,  it  would  be \n\nand human rights concerns. The process should be guided by international standards and best \npractice for protection, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable groups.  \n \n7. \nespecially important to deploy the resources transparently and to carefully monitor their use.  \n \n8. \nA coordinated approach is critical to ensure that the above principles are followed and \nto prevent duplication or overlap in activities. Development partners should minimize the burden \non the overextended Government, not least by maximizing their own coordination. Coordination \nshould not just be between Government and donors but involve all stakeholders, including civil \nsociety,  the  business  community,  and  international  nongovernment  organizations,  which  have \nresources that will not pass through the Government. Local capacity would need to be created \nfor such coordination.  \n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCOORDINATION OF EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR POST-TSUNAMI RECONSTRUCTION \n\n \n1. \nDuring  the  early  days  after  the  tsunami  struck  Sri  Lanka  on  26  December,  a  large \namount of assistance was spontaneously offered by individuals, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and the private sector. This included persons supplying food to and housing neighbors; \ncorporations  taking  charge  of  organizing  and  supplying  camps  for  people  displaced  by  the \ntsunami,  and  domestic  and  international  NGOs  along  with  agencies  from  the  United  Nations \n(UN)  system  mobilizing  large  amounts  of  supplies,  food,  water,  and  other  necessities. \nCoordination  was  made  difficult  by  the  large  number  of  agencies  and  organizations  involved, \nand by size of the affected area. The UN system helped greatly in establishing the Center for \nNational Operations, which coordinates the logistics and other dimensions of the relief effort.  \n \nThe  Government  issued  on  11  January  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  casualties, \n2. \ndamage, and reconstruction needs. It requested that international financial institutions such as \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC) jointly assess these needs to verify the Government estimates. Following a \njoint  mission  from  10  to  25  April  2005,  during  which  each  agency  focused  on  a  few  sectors \n(roads,  railways,  and  livelihoods  for  ADB;  education,  health,  and  housing  for  the  World  Bank; \nand  power,  telecommunications,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  for  JBIC)  drafts  of  this \nmultidonor assessment were circulated on 28 January and 2 February 2005. Shortly after, the \nLiberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  issued  a  draft  assessment  of  damage  in  the  North  East. \nInterestingly, the three estimates were of the same order of magnitude, estimating total damage \nat $1.5 billion\u2013$1.6 billion, more of it outside the southern and western provinces.  \n \nThe  next  steps  implemented  during  February  and  March  included  (i)  a  number  of \n3. \nconsultations with all stakeholders to reconcile the different estimates on the basis of common \ntechnical criteria, so that the Government could issue a revised needs assessment acceptable \nto  all  parties;  (ii)  a  second  phase  of  district-level  consultations  carried  out  by  mixed  teams \nrepresenting the Government, external development partners, and local stakeholders, to ensure \na  consultative  process  in  designing  implementation  mechanisms  for  reconstruction;  and  (iii) \nenlargement  of  the  development  partner  group  to  include  bilateral  donors,  UN  agencies,  civil \nsociety, and the private sector. To facilitate interaction, a representative steering committee with \nabout  10  members  meets  weekly  to  closely  supervise  the  continuing  needs  assessment  and \nidentify issues that need to be urgently addressed by the Government, while a larger meeting of \nall  development  partners  takes  place  every  2  weeks.  A  lead  agency  in  the  international \ncommunity  and  a  board  member  of  the  Task  Force  for  Rebuilding  the  Nation  (TAFREN) \nconvene  sector-level  meetings  where  the  development  partners  and  relevant  government \nministries  can  discuss  policy  issues,  refine  reconstruction  needs  estimates,  and  develop \nfinancing plans.  \n \nADB  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  road  sector.  Together  with  TAFREN,  the  Ministry  of \n4. \nHighways, and the Road Development Authority, ADB has convened three meetings, attended \nby the World Bank, JBIC, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the European Commission, \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency,  during  which  the  overall  reconstruction  needs  were \nreviewed, the possible role of each agency discussed, and a tentative financing plan developed, \nto  ensure  that  reconstruction  activities  are  fully  funded.  Discussion  was  also  started  on  the \nmeasures  to  ensure  prompt  and  transparent  implementation,  the  need  to  assess  the  capacity \nand possible role of the domestic contracting industry, the availability of construction materials, \nand long-term implications in terms of maintenance funding, and appropriate sequencing of the \nreconstruction in accordance to the road sector master plan being prepared.  \n\n\fINDIAN OCEAN TSUNAMI:  TRACKING MATRIX FOR THE REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION PHASE  -  Sri Lanka\nSector Summaries\n\nSector  a/\n\nPledges\n($ million)\n\nActual\n($ million)\n\nFunding\nGap\n($ million)\n\nInvolved Agencies\n\nGovernment\n\nDonor\n\nComments\n\n1.0 Agriculture & Natural Resources\n\n93.5\n\n24.4\n\n2.0 Energy\n\n66.8\n\n45.0\n\n21.8\n\nJapan, Germany\n\n3.0 Environment\n\n14.0\n\n22.0\n\nMinistry of Environment \nand Natural Resources\n\nADB, World Bank, \nNetherlands\n\n4.0 Industry and Trade\n\n118.0\n\n12.1\n\nEIB, Japan, USA, ADB 4.

The \ndestruction  wrought  by  tsunami  has  generated  legal  and  documentary  issues  for  tsunami-\naffected  people  and  the  government.  The  generous  contributions  of  tsunami-assistance \nprovided  by  the  international  community  raise  increase  the  risk  of  corruption  and  misuse  of \nfunds. This component seeks to help the government restore or replace lost documents, and to \nhelp  tsunami  victims  begin  to  resolve  their  legal  and  documentary  problems.  It  also  seeks  to \nhelp the government confront the greater risks of corruption that may follow the high volume and \nscale of foreign assistance being contributed to Sri Lanka post-tsunami. Physical infrastructure \nand buildings for the law and administration of justice system are identified in this Appendix 7, \nand  may  be  selected  as  a  subproject,  and  financed  under  Component  E:  Southern  Province \nReconstruction, and Component H: NECORD-II.  \n \n3. \nComponent are to \n\nthe  Legal  Assistance,  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption \n\nThe  subcomponents  of \n\n \n(i) \n\nprovide legal assistance and facilitation to tsunami-affected victims for accessing \nlegal  entitlements  to  help  them  address  issues  of  legal  entitlement  arising  from \nthe tsunami; \n\n\fAppendix 5a \n\n59\n\nestablish  a  decentralized  mechanism  for  tsunami  victims  for  private  dispute \nresolution and grievance review against public officials, which may involve one or \na combination of the following mechanisms currently under consideration: \n\n(a) \n\nTsunami Mediation Boards, based on existing statutory mediation boards; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\na  decentralized  Office  of  Tsunami  Ombudsmen,  or  extension  of  the \njurisdiction of the existing Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) to \ndeal with grievances against public officials relating to the tsunami; and  \n\nestablishing  a  division  within  the  administrative  division  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \nBribery  and  Corruption  Commission,  to  concentrate  on  the  detection, \ninvestigation,  and response to  tsunami-related corruption   \n\nconduct  training  and  awareness  workshops  for  judges,  magistrates,  district \nofficials,  and  the  public  on  potential  tsunami  /disaster  emergency  related  legal \nissues,  disputes  or  cases,  including  the  tsunami  legislative  framework  that  may \nbe adopted for making special provision for persons and property affected by the \ntsunami and incidental matters to persons;  \n\nsupport  the  Registrar  General\u2019s  Department  to  issue  replacement  birth,  death, \nand marriage certificates, and property titles;  \n\nsupport the Department of the Registration of Persons to facilitate the issuance \nor reissuance of identity cards;  \n\nsupport transparency of tsunami and emergency assistance, through  the Office \nof the President by: \n \n(a) \n\nsupporting or facilitating the publication in Sinhalese, Tamil, and English, \non the internet and in government newspapers, of (1) modes of tsunami \nassistance  from  Development  Partners  and  NGOs,  (2)  contract  and \nprocurement  details  in  relation  to  tsunami-assistance,  (3)  any  proposed \nlaws,  bills,  or  policy  relating  to  tsunami  assistance  (4)  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \nassistance to tsunami affected people; and  \n\n \n(b)  \n\nsupporting  data  collection  for  tsunami  affected  people,  and  tsunami \naffected  property  and  infrastructure  by  coordinating  data  collection  from \nthe Department of the Registration of Persons, the Registrar General, and \nother  relevant  departments,  through  modernizing  computer  collection  of \ninto \nsuch  data,  and \ncomputerized \nthe  connectivity, \nfacilitating \ncoordination and networking of such information; and \n\ntransforming  manual  central  record  keeping \n\nrecord  keeping,  and \n\nsupport to the MOFP for ensuring good governance in NGO provision of tsunami \nassistance  by  supporting  the  development  of  guidelines  or  regulations  on  NGO \ngovernance,  accountability,  transparency,  and  registration  in  the  provision  of \ntsunami assistance.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 5a \n\nPhysical infrastructure and buildings, such as courts, prisons, and district registry offices \n4. \nneeded to reestablish an effective law and public administration system are not included in this \ncomponent but may be selected as subprojects under components E and H. They are described \nin Appendix 7.  \n \n5. \nA  number  of  different  line  ministries  are  involved  in  this  component,  but  it  will  be \ncoordinated  by  the  MOJ.  To  coordinate  this  component,  a  coordinating  committee  will  be \nestablished, and will meet bimonthly. It will be chaired by the Secretary, MOJ, and comprised of \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Public Security, Law and Order, the MOFP, the Ministry of \nPublic Administration and Home Affairs, the Registrar General\u2019s Department, the Department of \nthe  Registration  of  Persons,  the  Office  of  the  President,  including  representatives  from  the \nDepartment  of  Policy,  Research  and  Information  Unit  media,  the  project  coordinator/director, \nSPC and NEPC, and any other relevant persons.  \n \n6. \nFor  this  component,  a  project  office,  led  by  a  coordinator/director,  and  supported  by \nsufficient staff adequately to conduct the component A activities, would be established within the \nMOJ.  \n \n7. \nTo coordinate the provision of legal and administrative infrastructure with Component E \nand Component H, a representative from the MOJ, and the Ministry of Public Administration and \nHome  Affairs,  and  the  project  coordinator/director  of  this  component  may  attend  the  national \nproject  coordination  committee  meetings,  and  the  provincial  project  coordination  committee \nmeetings. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nSubprojects  under  component  B  will  be  fully  funded  through  the  ATF.  Activities  will \ninclude  (i) construction  of  small-scale  community  infrastructure  (ii) support  for  livelihood \ndevelopment activities, (iii) restoration and developing practices for sustainable management of \nnatural  habitat,  (iv) support  for  community  development  planning  and  coordination  at  the  local \nauthority level, and (v) support for coastal resource planning and management at the district and \nprovincial  level.  Component  B  will  expand  the  areas  of  implementation  to  tsunami-affected \ngrama  niladhari  divisions1  in  Jaffna,  Kilinochchi,  and  Mullaittivu  districts.  The  coastal  planning \nactivities will include the district of Mannar as well, thereby covering the entire North and East \ncoastal  area.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  and  prioritized  generally  through  the  subproject \nselection process described in Appendix 6.  \n \n9. \nInfrastructure.  Small-scale  community  infrastructure  could  include  minor  roads, \nculverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement schemes, community buildings, and market and auction halls. The ceiling for such \nsmall-scale infrastructure is $50,000 per grama niladhari division.  \n \n10. \nLivelihood  Support.  Interventions  will  consist  of  advisory  services  to  identify  and \ndevelop suitable livelihood options (including small enterprises), skills development and transfer \nof  appropriate  technology,  and  facilitation  of  access  to  microcredit  under  concessionary  terms \nfor  tsunami  victims.  Revolving  funds  will  be  established  within  fisher\u2019s  societies  to  enable \npurchase of boats and fishing gear.  \n \n\nComponent B: North East Coastal Community Development  \n\n                                                 \n1 Grama niladhari divisions are the lowest level of administration.  \n\n\fAppendix 5a \n\n61\n\nComponent C: Road Rebuilding and Rehabilitation  \n\nEnvironment.  Degraded  or  destroyed  natural  habitat  will  be  restored  through  a \n11. \ncommunity-based  resource  mapping  process.  The  Project  will  help  restore  such  areas  and \nconcurrently  develop  sustainable  resource  management  practices  based  on  livelihood  or \nsupplementary income-generating activities that benefit adjacent communities.  \n \n12. \nCoastal Zone Planning. The tsunami highlighted the importance of planning to avert or \nreduce  the  impact  of  natural  disasters  or,  as  more  often  encountered,  cyclonic  storms.  The \nProject  will  support  a  coastal  zone  planning  process,  taking  into  consideration  the  natural \nhabitat and the need for coastal reservation zones. The planning process will be participatory, \nwith  coordination  at  the  division,  district,  and  provincial  levels.  The  ultimate  outcome  of  this \nprocess will be a consolidation and incorporation of planning outputs with the National Coastal \nZone Management Plan.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nComponent  C  will  be  fully  funded  through  the  ATF.  Subprojects  will  rehabilitate, \nreconstruct, and improve road links damaged by the tsunami, and improve the transport network \noverall  to  improve  disaster  response.  Access  along  tsunami-affected  coastal  roads  has  been \nrestored,  albeit \nresurfacing  and \nembankment  restorations  now  in  place  are  not  anticipated  to  last  beyond  the  next  monsoon \nseason.  More  thorough  and  permanent  road  rebuilding  measures,  particularly  for  improved \ndrainage,  are  necessary  to  protect  the  roadway  network  of  main  transport  links  and  feeder \nroads along the coastal belt, particularly against frequent high rains and potential flooding. The \nrehabilitation  of  strategic  road  links  in  the  North  East  will  improve  disaster-response  capacity \nand promote economic growth and community development.  \n \n14. \nThe  component  will  rebuild  approximately  300  kilometers  (km)  of  major  coastal  road \nlinks (classes A and B) in tsunami-affected areas, in the South and the North East. About 200 \nkm of damaged class-C, -D, and -E access roads in the Southern Province will be rebuilt and \nprovided with improved drainage.  \n \n15. \nTsunami-affected roads will be rebuilt according to national standards for each class of \nroad.  Measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  designs  to  improve  performance  and  durability \nagainst  expected  coastal  weather  and  drainage  patterns. To  provide  better  access  for  cyclists \nand  pedestrians,  particularly  in  the  North  East,  shoulders  will  be  paved  where  possible.  The \nroad works will include removal of mines and unexploded ordnance, reconstruction of previously \nsurfaced roads, drainage improvements and clearing, and repair or replacement of bridges. As \nthe  works  will  be  carried  out  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  neither  land  acquisition  nor \nresettlement are expected to be required.  \n\ntemporary\u2014repairs.

The  funds  will  be  used  to  provide  additional  distribution \nusing  temporary  intakes,  and  community-based  water  supply  in  the  district.  Distribution  in  the \nproject  areas  will  follow  the  specification  set  under  the  ongoing  project2  and  will  incorporate \nadditional distribution into the permanent design. Selection of the distribution sections will follow \nstakeholder  consultations  and  prioritization  in  the  project  areas.  The  component  will  provide \nindividual sanitation facilities to families affected by tsunami in the project area. Component D \nwill be fully funded through the ATF.  \n \n17. \nSelection  of  the  distribution  sections  to  be  constructed  will  include  (i)  areas  where  the \nwells and water sources are contaminated by saltwater, (ii) new settlement scheme and camps, \n(iii)  stakeholder  consultations  and  prioritization  in  the  project  areas,  (iv)  community-based \nschemes  for  small  villages  and  new  settlements,  and  (v)  individual  toilets  damaged  by  the \ntsunami and common sanitation facilities for camps. \n \nE. \n \n18. \nComponent  E  will  reconstruct,  rehabilitate,  and  support  small  infrastructure  in  the \nSouthern  Province  through  (i)  rehabilitation  of  local  government  roads;  (ii)  rebuilding  of \ncommunity  and  urban  infrastructure,  including  local  government  buildings  and  markets;  (iii) \nrebuilding shelter for poor and vulnerable families; and (iv) legal assistance and infrastructure. \nSubprojects will be selected and prioritized through the subproject selection process described \nin  Appendix  6  and  will  be  fully  funded  through  the  ATF.  At  the  request  of  provincial \ngovernments, \nfinanced  under \ncomponent A will be coordinated and associated with component E.

The  local  government  road  subcomponent  will  include  rehabilitation  of \n19. \nlocal  government  road  networks  and  bridges  damaged  by  the  tsunami  in  Galle,  Matara,  and \nHambantota.  All  road  construction  will  be  on  existing  alignments  and  will  not  require  land \nacquisition  or  resettlement.  Roads  to  be  rehabilitated  will  be  selected  from  the  list  of  roads \nidentified by the needs assessment and prioritized during implementation.  \n \n20. \nCommunity  and  Urban  Infrastructure.  The  tsunami  destroyed  or  damaged  a \nconsiderable  amount  of  community  infrastructure  along  the  southern  coastal  belt.  Subprojects \nwill  rebuild  community  and  urban  infrastructure,  including  local  government  offices  and \nbuildings,  courthouses,  public  libraries,  ayurvedic  (traditional  medicine)  dispensaries,  children \nparks, playgrounds, and village markets.  \n \nShelter. About 28,000 houses are damaged or destroyed in the tsunami-affected areas \n21. \nof  the  Southern  Province.  While  other  donors  have  made  large  commitments  to  reconstruct \ndamaged  or  destroyed  housing,  this  component  will  build  shelter  if  demand  is  unmet.  Shelter \nreconstruction  will  follow  Government  policy  in  selection  and  total  assistance  allowance  per \nfamily.  If  adequate  donor  financing  is  available,  funds  will  be  used  for  other  community \ninfrastructure rebuilding subprojects.  \n \n22. \ndescribed in Appendix 7, could be selected as subprojects under component E.  \n \nF. \n \nComponent F will be fully funded through the ATF. Subprojects will repair damage done \n23. \nto  coastal  stabilization  structures  and  harbor  breakwaters,  and  provide  small  fishing  boat \nanchorages and fisheries-related ancillary units, such as boat-building yards, net repair sheds, \nor cold-storage facilities, in the Southern and Western provinces. Coastal stabilization measures \nfor  the  Hikkaduwa  and  Bentota-Beruwala  sites,  which  have  been  designed  by  the  Coastal \nResources  Management  Project3  (CRMP)    will  be  extended  as  result  of  tsunami  damage  and \ndegradation.  Other  areas  in  need  of  urgent  repair  include  the  Kogalle  outlet,  Talpe,  and \nBattigama.  Restoration  of  these  and  other  similar  sections  is  urgent  and  will  be  carried  out \nbefore the next monsoon. Additional site selection for improvements will be made in accordance \nwith  the  original  parent  loan  selection  criteria  and  requirements.

Component F will enhance coastal protection by \nreestablishing green zones or green belts through intensive forestation with coastal vegetation, \nincluding  mangroves  that  would  serve  as  effective  barriers  not  only  against  tsunami  but  also \nagainst  coastal  erosion,  and  other  potentially  life-threatening  phenomena  such  as  cyclones, \nhurricanes,  floods,  and  sea-level  rise.  Where  practical,  tsunami  debris  will  be  used  as  core \nmaterial  for  construction  of  breakwaters  and  groins.

The  largest  share  (over  $80  million  in  the  short  term)  would  be  in  the  form  of \nmicrofinance or grants and aid in kind to restore the income-earning capacity of the fishers, and \nother micro-entrepreneurs. In a quick response, the Central Bank offers a 3% refinance scheme \nto  state-owned  and  private  banks  as  well  as  leasing  companies  for  disbursing  credit  to \nenterprises at a concessional lending interest rate of 6%.  \n \n26. \nTo supplement these efforts, and to ensure the loans go to those who need them most\u2014\nlow-income households, which comprise about 75% of all affected households\u2014component G \nwill provide microcredit through arrangements similar to the existing for tsunami-affected people \nunder the Rural Finance Sector Development Program4 (RSFDP). Financing for this component \nwill be sourced from a reallocation of funds from other ongoing projects and the ATF. RSFDP \nhas  140  participating  microfinance  institutions,  with  a  strong  presence  in  the  South.  The  loan \nsize  to  the  borrower  will  be  limited  to  Rs100,000.  Outreach  programs  and  skills  training  will \nprovide  information  to  affected  persons  on  opportunities  for  microenterprise.  Grant  support \nmight be considered during implementation to improve skill development, and to ensure lower \ncredit costs for households for the duration of the tsunami emergency credit. The interest rate \ncharged  will  not  be  above  6%,  in  line  with  the  Central  Bank  directive  for  loans  to  tsunami-\naffected people.  \n \n27. \nA  major  change  in  implementation  arrangement  for  RFSDP  was  approved  by  the  ADB \nVice  President  (Operations  Group  1)  on  23  February  2005  to  provide  microcredit  to  tsunami \naffected households (without changing existing criteria) for the restoration of productive assets \nand development of income-generating activities.  \n \nH. \n \n28. \nSubprojects under component H will reconstruct (i) basic social infrastructure damaged \nor  destroyed  in  the  coastal  belt  by  the  tsunami  in  a  variety  of  sectors,  including  health, \n\nComponent H: NECORD-Tsunami  \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2004.

Subprojects  will \n29. \nrestore facilities damaged or destroyed by the tsunami. Infrastructure will be rebuilt according to \nGovernment policies and regulations for post-tsunami reconstruction.  \n \n30.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Improvements will provide small community-based and \nmedium-sized town schemes, along with appropriate sanitation facilities to the community. This \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  will  be  linked  to  village  community  development  activities, \nparticularly where people displaced by the tsunami are returning. The approach and procedures \nof implementation of the water supply and sanitation subcomponents will be in accordance with \nthe  National  Policy  for  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector,  particularly  in  community \nparticipation  process  approach,  including  cost-sharing  arrangements,  selection  of  technology, \nprocurement  of  small  works  by  beneficiaries,  and  participation  of  local  government  in \nimplementation.  \n \n31. \nRural Roads. Rural access roads washed out by the tsunami will be reconstructed using \nlabor-intensive methods to provide  gravel-surfaced rural roads, to connect villages to the road \nnetwork,  irrigation  schemes,  or  community  facilities.  All  road  construction  will  be  on  existing \nalignments and will not require land acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n\nVillage Development and Shelter  \n\n2. \n \n32. \nVillage and Community Infrastructure. Facilities damaged or destroyed in the tsunami \nwill  be  rebuilt,  including  markets,  community  halls,  legal-sector  infrastructure  such  as  police \nstations, courthouses, prisons, and district registries (Appendix 7). To provide a respite from the \nreminders  of  the  conflict  and  the  tsunami,  small  recreational  facilities  will  be  developed  to  aid \nchildren, youths, and the elderly recuperate from the trauma.  \n \n33. \nShelter. As in the Southern Province, donors have made large commitments to rebuild \ndamaged or destroyed housing in the North East. If demand remains unmet, this component will \nconstruct shelter for vulnerable tsunami-affected families. Shelter will be provided in situ\u2014only \nat  preexisting  house  sites\u2014and  in  accordance  with  Government  regulations  for  tsunami \nreconstruction,  including  Government  policy  on  selection  and  total  assistance  allowance  per \nfamily.  If  adequate  donor  financing  is  available  for  shelter  reconstruction,  funds  for  this \nsubcomponent will be used for other village and community infrastructure subprojects.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 5b \n\n67\n\nSECTOR SCOPE AND CRITERIA \nNORTH EAST COMMUNITY RESTORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II \n\n \n1. \nThis section outlines the scope of the sectors. The broad selection criteria are explained \nin  the  main  text  of  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President.  The  selection  criteria  will \nfollow  the  already  developed  criteria  for  the  different  sectors  under  the  ongoing  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  funded  projects  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.  During  project \ninception, the detailed selection criteria will be developed and agreed on with the stakeholders.  \n \n2. \nSubprojects  will  be  financed  through  a  grant  and  loan  funds.  The  grant  funds  will  be \nused to reconstruct (i) community development, (ii) access roads and equipment for road works, \n(iii) special programs on HIV/AIDS1 and gender programs, and (iv) training. \n \n3. \nThe loan funds will be used for basic institutional infrastructure damaged or destroyed by \nthe  conflict  in  a  variety  of  sectors,  including  health,  education,  community  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and equipment.  \n \nA. \n \n\nGrant Funds \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Development \n\n \n4. \nVillage Development. A wide range of village-level subprojects across several sectors \nwill restore livelihoods, provide opportunities to generate income, and support reconciliation and \nsocial  cohesion.  Livelihood  opportunities  will  be  provided  in  communities  through  subprojects \nthat promote livestock development and market gardening, provide facilities for seed production, \nand other sectors that the communities are engaged. Restoration of district agriculture centers \nwill  help  farmers.  Skill  development  and  service  training  will  be  provided  for  microenterprise \ndevelopment  in  areas  such  as  horticulture,  postharvest  food  processing,  and  the  tourism  and \nhotel  industry.  To  enable  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  to  promote  microenterprise \ndevelopment at the village level, revolving funds will be established and managed by the CBO. \nGender-oriented  programs  for  enterprise  development,  initiated  as  a  pilot  program  under  the \nNECORD  \u2013  Extension  Project,  will  be  expanded  to  a  wider  range  of  fishing  and  agricultural \ncommunities. Given the high influx of construction workers responding to the recent increase in \nNorth  East  construction  activity,  an  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  will  be  waged  among \nconstruction workers and internally displaced people.  \n \nShelter. Conflict-affected returnees will be provided shelter at their previous house sites. \n5. \nShelter reconstruction will follow Government policy in selection and total assistance allowance \nper family. \n \n\n2. \n\nCivil Works \u2013 Rural / Access Roads \n\n \n6. \nAccess  Roads.  Rural  access  road  construction  will  use  labor-intensive  methods  to \nprovide gravel-surfaced rural roads, connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, \nor  community  facilities.  A  small  number  of  class-C  or  -D  provincial  roads  will  be  rehabilitated \nwith all-weather surfaces. All road construction will be on existing alignments and will not require \nland acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 5b \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Infrastructure \n\n \n7. \nInstitutional Infrastructure. Institutional capacity will be improved through subprojects \nthat restore damaged local government facilities and district offices or establish new ones, and \nrehabilitate  courts,  and  registrars  offices  in  the  North  East.  Although  area  institutions  have \nmanaged recent reconstruction activities well, the recent surge in construction and coordination \nactivities that result require stronger development capacity of these institutions.  \n \n\n4. \n\nTraining \n\n \n8. \nTraining. This component will supply training to staff in public administration, accounts, \nand information management. In anticipation of the growing need for skilled employees, training \nwill be provided to youths in construction, motor mechanics, and tourism-related trades, and will \nencompass construction of any special facilities required to provide these trainings.  \n \nB. \n\nLoan Funds\u2014Civil Works (basic social infrastructure) \n \n9. \nHealth.  Subprojects  will  restore  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture,  construction  of  doctor\u2019s  quarters  at  hospital  compounds,  and  rehabilitation  of  village \nhealth  clinics.  Although  hospital  staffing  is  generally  satisfactory,  an  essential  subproject \nselection criterion will stipulate sufficient availability of qualified staff to operate the rehabilitated \nfacilities as well as other existing facilities.  \n \nEducation. Subprojects will restore services and facilities through (i) reconstruction and \n10. \nrehabilitation  of  teaching  facilities  and  school  buildings  serving  a  large  population  area;  (ii) \nconstruction  of  cluster  housing  units  for  teachers  in  areas  where  housing  is  limited  or \nunavailable; and (iii) provision of training in special subjects such as primary education, English, \nscience, and math to teachers. Schools will only be rehabilitated where teachers are or can be \nmade  available.  Cluster-housing  units  will  be  provided  where  housing  is  limited  or  has  been \ndestroyed. Specialist training will be provided to improve the quality of the teachers, especially \nnew recruits.  \n \n11.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Improvements will provide small community-based and \nmedium-sized town schemes, along with sanitation facilities. Water supply and sanitation will be \nlinked to village community development activities, particularly where internally displaced people \nare  returning.  The  approach  and  procedures  of  implementation  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation subcomponents will be in accordance with the National Policy for Rural Water Supply \nand  Sanitation  Sector,  particularly  in  the  community  participation  process  approach,  including \ncost-sharing  arrangements,  selection  of \ntechnology,  procurement  of  small  works  by \nbeneficiaries, and participation of local government in the implementation.  \n \n12. \nIrrigation.  Activities  will  include  rehabilitation  of  medium-sized  and  large  irrigation \nschemes. Works will include rehabilitation of tank bunds, channel systems, access roads, and \nother structures, without changes to, or diversions of, natural watercourses. The activity will be \nlinked to village, agriculture, and livestock development.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n69\n\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCESS \n\n \n1. \nThe  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  (NECORD)  uses  a \nsector-style  process  approach  to  develop  individual  subprojects.  This  approach,  which  works \nwell,  will  be  used  to  prepare  subprojects  under  component  B  (North  East  coastal  community \ndevelopment), component E (Southern Province reconstruction), and component H (NECORD-\nTsunami),  under  the  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  and  subprojects \nunder the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II (NECORD-II).  \n \n2. \nSubprojects  will  be  initially  conceived  by  beneficiaries,  nongovernment  organizations, \ngovernment  departments,  or  newly  formed  village  rehabilitation  committees  to  restore \ncommunity livelihoods and area infrastructure damaged or lost as a result of the tsunami or the \ndecades-long  conflict.  These  subproject  proposals  will  be  first  presented  to  the  divisional \nrehabilitation  committee  (DRC)  present  in  the  affected  districts.  The  DRC  will  review  and \nevaluate  each  proposal  against  set  subproject  criteria.  If  approved,  the  proposal  will  be \nforwarded  to  the  district  rehabilitation  coordinating  committee  (DRCC)  or  its  equivalent,  which \nwill  further  scrutinize  the  subproject.  The  district  project  management  unit  (DPMU)  will  help \nthese  agencies  prepare  subproject  proposals  in  the  standard  formats  to  be  used  for  both \nprojects.  \n \nAfter  approval  by  the  DRCC,  the  DPMU  through  the  government  agent  or  district \n3. \nsecretary will present the subproject to the respective project management units (PMUs), which \nwill  review  each  subproject  in  detail,  to  ensure  that  the  subproject  (i)  addresses  the  overall \nscope of the project, (ii) is eligible under the general and subcomponent-related criteria, (iii) will \nnot  create  any  problems  in  the  area,  (iv)  has  been  sufficiently  justified,  and  (v)  will  attain  the \ndesired outputs and benefits. The PMUs will (i) perform a detailed review of the subproject cost \nestimate  and  implementation  schedule;  (ii)  verify  beneficiary  contribution;  (iii)  determine  if \ncontractors  are  available  and  capable  of  performing  the  work;  (iv)  confirm  that  land  will  be \navailable; and (v) investigate any gender, social, or environmental concerns.  \n \n4. \nIf the PMU finds that the subproject satisfies all the evaluation criteria, the proposal will \nbe then forwarded to the provincial project coordinating committee (PPCC) and, 15 days before \na  PPCC  meeting,  circulated  to  ADB  and  the  relevant  secretaries,  ministries,  provincial,  and \ndistrict  heads  of  departments;  government  agents;  government  security  coordinators  (police, \narmy);  nongovernment  organizations;  the  United  Nations  system;  and  any  other  development \ninstitution  implementing  projects  in  the  area  (World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, etc.).  \n \n5. \nThe  PPCC,  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary,  typically  meets  every  2  months  to  present \neach  subproject  for  conditional  approval.  Attendees  at  the  PCC  include  ADB,  relevant  PMU \nstaff,  government  agents,  district  deputy  project  directors,  and  representatives  from  national \nministries.  Subprojects  not  approved  by  the  PPCC  will  be  returned  to  the  PMU  or  DPMU  for \nfurther clarification or justification. If a subproject is approved by the PPCC, the PMU will inform \nthe proponent to develop the subproject to include the designs, bill of quantities, specifications, \nand  the  bid  documents.  The  final  subproject  proposal  will  then  be  forwarded  to  ADB  for \napproval.  Subprojects  not  approved  by  ADB  will  be  returned  to  the  PMU  for  clarification  or \nmodifications  to  better  comply  with  criteria  set  forth  for  TAARP  or  NECORD-II  or  ADB \nguidelines.  \n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nOnce  ADB  gives  final  approval,  competitive  tenders  will  be  called,  bids  evaluated,  and \n6. \nawards  made  to  the  substantially  responsive  lowest  bidder.  Subprojects  will  then  be \nadministered through the PMU until completion of the contract.  \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n71\n\nFigure A6: Subproject Approval Process Diagram \n\n \n\nTypical Timeline \n\nSteps\n\nResponsibility \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nSubproject identification \n\nDeveloping conceptual project \nproposal\u2014standard document \n \n\nSubmission  for  approval  and \nentering to MIS \n\nBeneficiaries / departments / \nnongovernment organizations / \ndivisional rehabilitation committee \n(DRC), district rehabilitation \ncoordinating committee (DRCC) and \ndistrict project management units \n(DPMU)\n\nDPMU through district \nsecretaries (government \nagents)  \n\nChecking against criteria \n\nProject management unit  \n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n4\n-\n \n\n0\n3\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n3\n-\n \n\n0\n2\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n4\n-\n \n0\n3\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n \n3\n-\n2\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n7\n-\n \n0\n5\n\n \ns\nh\nt\no\nm\n \n2\n1\n-\n6\n\nj\n\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\nc\ne\ne\nR\n/\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\ni\nf\ni\nr\na\nC\n\nl\n\nSubproject submission for \nPPCC approval \n\nProject management unit \n\nDevelopment of detailed proposal \nand bidding documents\n\nDepartments or proponent \n\nFinal subproject approval\n\nADB\n\nCalling tenders \n\nBidding \n\nTender evaluation\n\nDPMU through district \nsecretaries or PMU \n(depending on the costs)\n\nDomestic contractors \n\nDistrict committee or project \ntender boards through \ndistrict secretaries \n\nAward \n\nDPMU or PMU \n\nContract approval \n\nADB \n\nImplementation and quality \nchecks \n\nDepartments/DPMU/PMU \n\nHanding over\n\nDPMU/PMU \n\nOperation and maintenance\n\nDepartments/Beneficiaries \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nLEGAL ASSISTANCE, GOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION COMPONENT \n\n \n1. \nThe  destruction  wrought  by  tsunami  has  generated  legal  and  documentary  issues  for \ntsunami-affected people and the government. The generous contributions of tsunami-assistance \nprovided  by  the  international  community  increase  the  risk  of  corruption  and  misuse  of  funds. \nThis component seeks to help the  government restore or replace lost documents, and to help \ntsunami victims begin to resolve their legal and documentary problems. It also seeks to help the \ngovernment confront the greater risks of corruption that may follow the high volume and scale of \nforeign  assistance  being  contributed  to  Sri  Lanka  post-tsunami.  Physical  infrastructure  and \nbuildings for the law and administration of justice system are identified in this Appendix 7, and \nmay  be  selected  as  a  subproject,  and  financed  under  Component  E:  Southern  Province \nReconstruction, and Component H: NECORD-II. \n \n2. \nComponent are to: \n\nthe  Legal  Assistance,  Governance  and  Anticorruption \n\nThe  subcomponents  of \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nprovide legal assistance and facilitation to tsunami-affected victims for accessing \nlegal  entitlements  to  help  them  address  issues  of  legal  entitlement  arising  from \nthe tsunami; \n\nestablish or strengthen a decentralized mechanism for tsunami victims for private \ndispute  resolution,  and  grievance  review  against  public  officials,  which  may \ninvolve  one  or  a  combination  of  the  following  mechanisms  currently  under \nconsideration: \n\n(a) \n\nTsunami Mediation Boards, based on existing statutory mediation boards; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\na  decentralized  Office  of  Tsunami  Ombudsmen,  or  extension  of  the \njurisdiction of the existing Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) to \ndeal with grievances against public officials relating to the tsunami; and  \n\nestablishing a unit within the administrative division of Sri Lanka\u2019s Bribery \nthe  detection, \nand  Corruption  Commission, \ninvestigation,  and response to  tsunami-related corruption;  \n\nto  concentrate  on \n\nconduct  training  and  awareness  workshops  for  judges,  magistrates,  district \nofficials,  and  the  public  on  potential  tsunami  /  disaster  emergency  related  legal \nissues,  disputes  or  cases,  including  the  tsunami  legislative  framework  that  may \nbe adopted for making special provision for persons and property affected by the \ntsunami;  \n\nsupport the Registrar General\u2019s Department issue replacement birth, death, and \nmarriage certificates, and property titles;  \n\nsupport the Department of the Registration of Persons facilitate the issuance or \nreissuance of identity cards;  \n\nsupport  transparency  of  tsunami  and  emergency  assistance,  through  the  Office \nof the President by: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n73\n\n(a) \n\n \n(b)  \n\nsupporting or facilitating the publication in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, on \nthe  internet  and  in  government  newspapers,  of  (1)  modes  of  tsunami \nassistance  from  development  partners  and  NGOs,  (2)  contract  and \nprocurement  details  in  relation  to  tsunami-assistance,  (3)  any  proposed \nlaws,  bills,  or  policy  relating  to  tsunami-assistance  (4)  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \nassistance to tsunami affected people; and  \n\nsupporting  data  collection  for  tsunami  affected  people,  and  tsunami \naffected  property  and  infrastructure,  by  coordinating  data  collection  from \nthe Department of the Registration of Persons, the Registrar General, and \nother relevant departments or authorities, through modernizing collection \nof  such  data,  and  transforming  manual  central  record  keeping  into \nthe \ncomputerized \nconnectivity,  coordination  and  networking  of  such  data  and  information; \nand \n\nrecord  keeping  and \n\nretrieval,  and \n\nfacilitating \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n(vii) \n\nsupport to the MOFP for ensuring good governance in NGO provision of tsunami \nassistance  by  supporting  the  development  of  guidelines  or  regulations  on  NGO \ngovernance,  accountability,  transparency,  and  registration  in  the  provision  of \ntsunami assistance.  \n\nLegal Facilitation and Assistance  \n\n1. \n\nTsunami-generated Legal and Documentary Issues  \n\nis  developing  a \n\nThe  Government \n\n \n3. \nThe  destruction  wrought  by  tsunami  has  generated  legal  and  documentary  issues  for \ntsunami-affected  people  and  the  government.  Such  legal  issues  arise  from  the  loss  of \ndocuments,  such  as  property  titles,  birth,  death,  and  marriage  certificates,  court  records,  and \nbank  account  documents.  They  also  arise  from  the  devastating  loss  of  life  caused  by  the \ntsunami, as, following these mass deaths, custody, fostering, and adoption of children, and the \ninheritance of real and personal property have all arisen as problems. Issues such as insurance \ncoverage, property disputes, and other entitlement issues are follow-on concerns.  \n \n4. \nthe  post-tsunami \nreconstruction period to enable special legal provisions for persons and property affected by the \ntsunami, and related purposes. Legislation under the framework would shorten the presumption \nof  death,  provide  for  the  custody,  fostering,  and  adoption  of  children,  and  establish  provisions \nrelated  to  property  rights.  It  would  also  double  the  penalty  for  any  crime,  if  it  is  committed  in \nrelation  to  property  or  money  intended  for  tsunami  relief.  The  legislative  framework  assumes \nknowledge  of  the  law  and  also  establishes  crimes  in  relation  to  custody  of  tsunami-affected \nchildren if certain requirements are not met.  \n \n5. \nTo translate formal legal solutions into solutions for tsunami-affected people, will require \nthem,  and  divisional  and  district  level  government  officials  (District  Secretaries,  Divisional \nSecretaries, and grama niladhari1), to understand these new legal requirements, and be able to \nproceed along appropriate channels. They will also need to have assistance to resolve any legal \nquestions that may arise. Members of the law and administration of justice system in tsunami-\naffected areas will similarly need to be made aware of the mechanisms for resolving tsunami-\nrelated legal and administrative problems.  In the tsunami-affected areas of the North and East \n\nframework \n\nlegislative \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1 Grama niladhari divisions are the lowest level of government administration.  \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nand  the  South,  already  poor  and  vulnerable  people  will  have  difficulty  negotiating  formal \navenues, and clearly need assistance to avail themselves of the new laws and procedures.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal Facilitation and Assistance  \n\n \n6. \nADB has received strong requests from Provincial Government to support the provision \nof decentralized legal facilitation and assistance for tsunami-related issues. As a subcomponent \nof  this  component,  legal  facilitation  and  assistance  for  tsunami-related  legal  and  documentary \nissues  would  be  provided  to  tsunami-affected  people.  The  provision  of  assistance  would  be \nfunctionally decentralized  in  the  tsunami-affected  areas  of  the  North  and  East,  the  South,  and \nthe  West  and  Colombo  shall  be  covered  together.  The  provision  of  legal  assistance  and \nfacilitation would be coordinated with, but separate from each Provincial Secretariat, and offices \nwould also be decentralized with a small secretariat in the  North and East (Trincomalee), and \nthe  South.  Staff  would  have  access  to  transportation  in  order  to  conduct  outreach,  by  visiting \naffected communities, and to service all relevant districts. Approximately seven legal facilitators \nwould be engaged in the North and East, nominally one for each of the seven tsunami-affected \ndistricts. However, certain districts may need more assistance than others. Approximately three \nlegal  facilitators  would  also  be  engaged  in  the  South,  nominally  one  for  each  district  in  the \nSouth. A least an additional legal facilitator will be engaged in Colombo to serve Colombo and \nKalutara  tsunami  victims,  who  would  work  together  with  TAARP  director/coordinator.  Where \ndeemed appropriate by the MOJ, and agreed with ADB, legal facilitation and assistance under \nTAARP may be channeled through and support existing offices of the Legal Aid Commission. In \nthe  North  and  East  where  existing  Legal  Aid  Commission  offices  do  not  exist,  or  for  simple \nmatters not requiring access to courts, legal facilitators would not be attached to the Legal Aid \nCommission.  \n \n7. \nThis  component  coordinator/director  would  coordinate  this  subcomponent,  facilitate \ncross learning amongst the decentralized offices and monitor the conduct of legal services. This \nsubcomponent  would  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  Legal  Aid  Commission,  its  associated \nProvincial  Bar  Associations,  the  Retired  Judges  Association,  the  United  Nations  High \nCommission  on  Refugees, \nthe  United  Nation\u2019s  Development  Program,  civil  society \norganizations (CSOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the International \nDevelopment Law Organization. and other relevant development partners.  \n \nB. \n\nPrivate  Dispute  Resolution,  Public  Grievance  Review,  and  Anticorruption \nComplaints  \n\n \n8. \nThe  legal  and  factual  issues  generated  by  the  tsunami,  are  also  likely  to  lead  to \nincreased disputes  and grievances both  among  tsunami-affected  people,  and  possibly  against \ngovernment  officers  and  departments.  The  Government  has  agreed  with  donors  on  a  set  of \nGuiding Principles to be followed on the path to recovery from the tsunami. Among other things, \nthe Guiding Principles promote transparency, participation, accountability, and a zero-tolerance \nfor  any  corruption  associated  with  tsunami  assistance.  Similarly  the  proposed  tsunami \nlegislative framework would increase penalties for tsunami related crimes and improprieties. In \nfurtherance of  the  Guiding  Principles  and  the  Government\u2019s  objectives, and  to  assist  tsunami-\naffected  people  with  disputes  and  grievances,  a  decentralized  provincial  system  of  public \ngrievance  review  and  private  dispute  resolution  would  be  established  or  supported  in  the \ntsunami-affected  areas  and  staffed  by  independent  persons  in  the  North  and  East,  the  South, \nand Colombo. The mechanisms would seek to resolve private disputes, and investigate claims \nof  impropriety  against  public  officials  relating  to  tsunami  assistance.  Three  proposals  for \nachieving  this  end  are  currently  being  considered.  A  combination  of  these  mechanisms  is \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n75\n\nviewed  as  likely  the  most  appropriate  way  to  provide  a  form  of  dispute  resolution,  public \ngrievance review, and  anti-corruption fora. The final mechanism may involve a combination of \nall or a different combination of these.  \n \n\n1. \n\nMediation Boards \n\n9. \nUnder  the  Mediation  Board  approach,  support would  be  provided  to  establish Tsunami \nMediation Boards, in conjunction with the MOJ, and the Asia Foundation. The Asia Foundation \nhas successfully worked with the Government to establish existing statutory Mediation Boards. \nUnder  the  Mediation  (Special  Categories  of  Disputes)  Act,  No.  21  of  2003,  the  Minister  of \nJustice is entitled to gazette special Mediation Boards, for special categories, special areas, and \nfor  specific  categories  of  dispute.  Currently  under  consideration,  is  the  gazetting  of  Tsunami \nMediation  Boards  as  a  special  category,  and  defining  tsunami-affected  areas,  and  tsunami \ndisputes such as property and custody disputes as specific categories.  Such special Tsunami \nMediation  Boards  would  also  have  the  power  to  consider  grievances  against  public  officials, \nhowever they may not be the most effective fora to do so as sensitive issues of administrative \nlaw  may  be  raised,  or  possibly  issues  of  corruption  or  impropriety,  that  are  not  suitable  for \nconsensus-based solutions. Various forms of support may be required to ensure that mediation \nboards  become \ntraining  and  engaging \nconsultants.  \n \n\ntsunami-affected  areas, \n\nfunctional \n\nincluding \n\nin \n\n2. \n\nTsunami  Ombudsmen  or  Extension  of  Parliamentary  Commissioner \n(Ombudsmen) to Tsunami-Affected Areas \n\n \nADB  has  received  strong  requests \n\nfrom  Provincial  Government \n\nto  support  a \n10. \ndecentralized Office of Tsunami Ombudsmen. Under this approach, TAARP would support the \nestablishment of a decentralized Office of Tsunami Ombudsmen or the extension of jurisdiction \nof the existing Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) established under Article XIX of the \nConstitution of Sri Lanka and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Act No. 17 of \n1981,  to  tsunami-affected  areas,  to  deal  with  grievances  against  public  officials  relating  to  the \ntsunami.  This  approach  adopts  lessons  learned  from  the  experience  following  the  Gujarat \nearthquake in India.  In the wake of that earthquake, which killed over 20,000 people, the Indian \nHigh Court gave orders for speedy and effective legal aid for victims. A new ombudsmen role \nwas  given  to  the  State  Legal  Services  Authority  to  look  into  complaints  against  public \nadministration. Also, with the help of the Ombudsmen, special legal cells were made functional \nto facilitate legal assistance on legal issues pertaining to inheritance, family law, and property.  \n \n11. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  Provincial  Government  proposal,  each  Office  of  Tsunami \nOmbudsmen would have a provincial coordinator, and be associated with, but separate from the \nProvincial Secretariat. Approximately four Tsunami Ombudsmen would be assigned to the North \nand  East,  and  approximately  two  Tsunami  Ombudsmen  would  be  assigned  to  the  South.  Its \nstaff would service all relevant districts by conducting outreach to tsunami-affected areas. The \nOffice  would  establish  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for  handling  such  complaints,  for \nproactively  and  constructively  responding  to  them,  and  for  providing  the  public  with  notice  of \nsuch  Office,  including  publishing  notices  in  government-owned  newspapers.  The  Office  would \nbe  closely  coordinated  with  the  provision  of  tsunami  legal  facilitation  and  assistance,  the \nParliamentary  Commissioner  (Ombudsmen),  the  Retired  Judges  Association,  the  United \nNations High Commission on Refugees, the United Nation\u2019s Development Program on access \nto  justice,  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs),  and  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs), \nincluding  the  International  Development  Law  Organization.  and  other  relevant  development \npartners.  \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nThe possibility of implementing the functions of the Tsunami Ombudsmen by extending \n12. \nthe  powers  and  function  of  the  existing  Parliamentary  Commissioner  (Ombudsmen)  has  been \nraised. If this becomes the Government\u2019s preferred approach, ADB would ensure that it serves \nthe  needs  initially  requested  by  the  Provincial  Government.  In  such  a  case,  TAARP  would \nsupport the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) to go on circuit to the tsunami-affected \nareas. \n \n13. \nThe  benefits  of  an  ombudsmen  approach  to  public  grievance  review  and  corruption \nredressal  are  clear  and  recognized  by  many  stakeholders.  However,  there  are  certain  legal \nchallenges in implementing an Office of Tsunami Ombudsmen in Sri Lanka, that would need to \nbe overcome for it able to be established quickly enough to be an effective response to public \ngrievances in the post- tsunami context. This approach remains tabled and under consideration, \nbut  the  other  two  approaches  that  work  with  existing  institutions  in  Sri  Lanka  are  currently \npreferred as more likely to be able to be used to provide a timely response.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBribery and Corruption Commission \n\nJudicial Training Workshops and Legal Awareness \n\n \n14. \nNew  Commissioners  to  the  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  and \nCorruption  (the  \u201cBribery  and  Corruption  Commission\u201d)  were  appointed  in  March  2005.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  that  the  administrative  branch  that  conducts  investigations,  and  acts \nunder the Director General in the Bribery and Corruption Commission would be strengthened by \nformation of a tsunami unit, which may also have regional offices in tsunami affected areas. The \nBribery  and  Corruption  Commission  would  thus  serve  tsunami-affected  areas.  TAARP  would \nsupport this strengthening.  \n \nC. \n \n15.  Magistrates, district court, and high court judges, in tsunami-affected areas, need to be \nfamiliarized with the property and custody legal issues likely to arise post-tsunami, and the post-\ntsunami  legislative  framework  when  enacted.  The  types  of  legal  issues  that  are  likely  to  arise \nare  anticipated,  however  the  details  of  the  sorts  of  disputes  have  not  yet  been  identified,  and \nmay be investigated as part of the data-collection process described in part F below. Based on \nmore detailed data identifying the nature of tsunami-related legal disputes likely to come up in \ncourts,  in  conjunction  with  the  MOJ  and  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  judicial  training  institute,  TAARP  would \ncoordinate  a  series  of  magistrate,  judicial  training,  officer,  and  public  legal  awareness \nworkshops in or for the tsunami-affected areas.  \n \n16. \nThe  tsunami  legislative  framework  presumes  knowledge  of  the  law  and  imposes  jail \npenalties  for  violations  such  as  holding  custody  of  an  \u201corphan\u201d  without  complying  with  certain \nprocedures.  Legal  awareness  workshops  will  be  coordinated  for  district  officials,  local  law \nenforcers, and the public, in conjunction with, or independently from the judicial workshops for  \ntsunami related issues.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  Registrar  General\u2019s  Department,  within  the  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  and \nHome Affairs, oversees the registration of births, deaths, marriages, private property titles, and \nliens on moveable property. It is responsible for replacing documents destroyed in the tsunami, \noriginal birth, death, marriage, immoveable property liens, and property title documents either in \nthe possession of tsunami victims, or at district or divisional offices of the Registrar General.  \n \n\nReplacement Documents  \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n77\n\nIn Galle alone, as of 29 March 2005, 8,000 applications had been made for replacement \n18. \ndocuments,  of  which  only  2000  have  been  provided  to  tsunami  affected  people.  A  copy  of  all \nbirth, death, and marriage records held by individuals, and held in district or divisional offices is \nretained in the Central Record Room of the Registrar General in Colombo. However, the Central \nRecord  Room  is  manually  sorted,  and  categorized  by  registration  numbers.  If  individuals  who \napply for replacement documents do not know their registration number, many records must be \nsorted  to  provide  a  replacement.  In  many  cases  it  would  appear  to  be  an  almost  impossible \ntask.  The  Central  Record  Room  has  limited  photocopiers,  and  limited  basic  filing  equipment.  \nThe essential post-tsunami reissuance of documents would appear not likely to get done, unless \nchanges are made.  \n \n19. \nTAARP  will  provide  support  to  the  Registrar  General\u2019s  Department  in  reissuing  birth, \ndeath,  marriage,  and  property  title  records  to  tsunami-affected  people,  and  issuing  death \ncertificates,  by  computerizing  their  Central  Record  Room  and  purchasing  filing  cabinets, \nphotocopiers, scanners, and similar office facilities, if required. This would be coordinated with \nthe  Office  of  the  President  (discussed  in  part  F  below)  who  are  attempting  to  centralize  data \ncollection  efforts  to  minimize  duplications  of  efforts  and  to  limit  the  extent  to  which  tsunami \naffected  people  are  approached  by  multiple  government  agencies  and  NGOs  for  similar  data \ncollection  questions.  Following  preparatory  work  on  TAARP,  the  Office  of  President\u2019s \ncoordination  now  includes  the  Department  of  Registration  of  Persons,  and  the  Registrar \nGeneral.  Computer  automation  of  the  central  record  room  will  use  software  for  efficiently \ncapturing  and  retrieving  archived  documents.  ADB  may  support  the  purchase  of \ncomputers, and will support networking and connectivity of such equipment, as well as \nthe  purchase  of  office  items.  It  would  also  support  mobile-van  services  to  tsunami-affected \ndistricts,  which  may  include  retroactive  financing.  Computer  automation  of  registration  would \nreduce the extent that individuals could falsely obtain multiple registrations.  \n \nE. \n \n20. \nThe  Department  of  the  Registration  of  Persons,  within  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security \nLaw  and  Order,  issues  identification  cards.  Identification  cards  are  used  in  Sri  Lanka  to  open \nbank  accounts,  obtain entry  to  certain  places,  to  obtain  passports,  etc.  Following  the  tsunami, \nthousands of identity cards need to be replaced, and tsunami-affected people issued with new \nidentification.  Ensuring  that  all  tsunami-affected  people  have  an  identity  card  that  they  use  to \nobtain  assistance  is  an  additional  measure  to  minimize  false  claims  for  assistance.  As  of  1 \nMarch 2005, following mobile teams sent to tsunami-affected areas in Kalutara, Galle, Matara, \nHambantota,  Trincomalee  and  Kilinochchi  Districts,  over  30,000  applications  for  identity  cards \nfor tsunami victims had been received. It is anticipated that over 100,000 applications would be \nreceived when all the mobile services are completed.  \n \n21. \nThe  processing  of  applications  including  tracing  and  perusal  of  index  cards  and  past \napplications  is  an  essential  part  of the  process.  It  is  both  time  consuming  and  labor  intensive.  \nThe  overwhelming  majority  of  applications  are  from  people  who  have  lost  their  identity  cards \nand  do  not  remember  their  identity  card  number.  This  causes  additional  work  for  the \ndepartment.  As  the  records  are  not  computerized,  the  task  of  tracing  all  records  has  to  be \nattended to manually. The records pertaining to more than 20.5 million identity cards are stored \nin  three  different  locations  in  Keppetipola,  Nugegoda  and  Barnes,  adding  to  difficulties  as  the \nnormal  work  of  the  department  has  to  be  attended  simultaneously.  However,  the  issuing  of \nidentity cards for tsunami victims cannot be delayed. Department staff are being deployed after \nworking hours and during week-ends. It is expected that the extra remuneration payable to the \n\nReplacement or Issue of Identification Cards  \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nTransparency and Tsunami Data Collection \n\nstaff  deployed  for  this  work  will  be  in  the  region  of  Rs1,000,000  at  the  rate  of  Rs10.00  per \napplication and even with additionally deployed staff there is no surety that the records will be \nlocated. The Department does not have funds to meet this expenditure, nor associated needed \noffice  facilities  services  such  as  computers  and  photocopiers.  This  subcomponent  would \nsupport  the  Department  of  the  Registration  of  Persons,  in  a  similar  way  to  that  done  for  the \nRegistrar  General.  In  addition  to  promoting  coordination,  and  joint  data  collection  efforts, \nTAARP would computerize data held by the Department of the Registration of Persons, to allow \nit to be matched with data obtained from tsunami-affected persons. To further limit the use and \nabuse  of  tsunami  assistance  funds  by  tsunami-affected  individuals,  a  temporary  identification \ncard would be issued and connected to a tsunami-affected individual\u2019s details. By doing this, the \nextent to which false claims could be reduced. In addition, mobile-van services and outreach to \ntsunami-affected districts, would be supported if necessary. \n \nF. \n \n22. \nThe Office of the President, through its Department of Policy, Research and Information \nUnit media has begun efforts to coordinate the many separate effort to collect data in relation to \ntsunami-affected infrastructure and tsunami affected people. This coordination now includes the \nDepartment of the Registration of Persons and the Registrar General.  They are attempting to \ncentralize  data  collection  efforts  to  minimize  duplications  of  efforts  and  to  limit  the  extent  to \nwhich tsunami-affected people are approached by multiple government agencies and NGOs for \nsimilar data collection questions. The Office of the President has obtained from IBM computers \na  large  number  of  lap-top  computers  and  hardware  that  could  be  used  for  personal \nidentification,  that  it  plans  to  use  in  and  distribute  to  each  tsunami-affected  district.  The \ncomputers  would  be  used  to  store  data  on  tsunami-related  needs  and  damage,  to  facilitate \ncentralization  and  coordination  of  tsunami-related  data,  to  maximize  transparency,  and  to \nimprove  governance  and  limit  the  potential  for  corruption.  However,  for  such  hardware  to  be \nused  for  its  intended  purposes,  the  Office  of  the  President  needs  to  have  the  stand-alone \nlaptops  connected  and  networked  to  ensure  transferal  and  connectivity  of  data.  In  addition, \ninformation  technology  staff  are  needed  to  collect  the  data,  and  may  need  some  training. \nTAARP  will  support  the  connectivity  and  networking  of  the  computers,  and  the  training  or \nengagement  of  staff.  Once  the  data  is  obtained  from  tsunami-affected  people,  a  temporary \ntsunami-identification  card  and  number  would  be  issued,  and  the  temporary  tsunami-\nidentification  and  number  would  be  used  to  facilitate  matching  information  to  locate  records \npreviously stored manually.  \n \nUnder the subcomponents described above in part D and E, once centrally kept data is \n23. \nautomated,  and  the  information  linked,  the  data  collected  from  tsunami-affected  people  would \nbe able to be matched with it, to provide tsunami-affected people with some of their lost records.  \n \nIn addition, the Office of the President, through its Department of Policy, Research and \n24. \nInformation Unit media, would facilitate the coordination required to ensure that information on \ntsunami  assistance,  post-tsunami  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  and  related  laws  and \npolicies, would be placed on a tsunami web-site, and published in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, \nin the government\u2019s newspapers. This would require some coordination amongst departments, \ndonors,  and  NGOs  to  obtain  the  appropriate  information.  The  information  to  be  included  may \npresent  financial  statements,  track  procurement  contract  awards,  including  its  amount,  and \nbasic information on the processes adopted, the list of goods or services purchased and their \nutilization.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n79\n\nNGO Accountability \n\nLaw, Justice, and Public Administration Infrastructure \n\nG. \n \n25. \nThe  number  of  NGOs  that  now  exist  in  Sri  Lanka  has  increased  dramatically  from  in \nrecent months post-tsunami.  NGOs commonly call for accountability from government and the \nprivate  sector  in  conducting  their  activities.  At  the  request  of  the  government,  in  order  to \nfacilitate  accountability,  transparency  and  good  governance,  from    all  NGOs  operating  in  the \npost-tsunami  context,  TAARP  will  support  a  consultant  to  work  with  the  MOFP  on  refining \nguidelines  or  regulations  on  NGO  governance,  accountability,  transparency,  and  possibly \nregistration in the provision of NGO Tsunami assistance.  \n \nH. \n \nLaw and administration of justice infrastructure will not be financed under Component A, \n26. \nbut  may  be  selected  as  community  infrastructure  subprojects  and  financed  by  TAARP  under \nComponents E and H.  \n \nCourts and labor tribunals, prisons, and police stations, were damaged and destroyed by \n27. \nthe  tsunami.  The  MOJ  has  assessed  the  damage  to  courts  and  labor  tribunals,  prisons,  and \npolice  stations,  to  amount  to  be  between  $37  million  and  $45  million\u2013\u2013a  subset  of  which  has \nbeen  identified  as  immediate  priorities.  Table  A7.1  sets  out  the  immediate  priorities  for \nreconstruction  of  courts  and  judges  quarters.  Table  A7.2  sets  out  the  identified  priorities  for \nreconstruction  of  prisons.  Ultimately,  legal  assistance,  and  quasi-judicial  grievance  review  will \nonly  work  in  the  shadow  of  the  formal  legal  system,  so  the  reconstruction  of  courts,  police \nstations, prisons is necessary as a first step to getting the formal legal system operational in the \ntsunami-affected  areas.  Under  TAARP,  courts  and  court  complexes  in  tsunami-affected  areas \ncan be restored as subprojects within Components E and H.  \n \n28. \nAs  described  above,  the  Registrar  General  registers  births,  deaths,  marriages,  private \nproperty title, and liens on moveable property. The tsunami destroyed the Matara and Mullaittivu \nLand and District Registry Offices of the Registrar General, and the damaged Civil Registration \nSection,  of  the  Divisional  Secretariats  of  the  Registrar  General  in  the  districts  of  Weligama, \nHikkaduwa,  and  Pottuvil.  These  tsunami-destroyed  buildings,  and  records,  will  need  to  be \nrestored or replaced. TAARP would permit urgent reconstruction of these offices as subprojects \nunder  Components  E  and  H.  Table  A7.3  sets  out  the  identified  priorities  for  reconstruction  of \ndivisional  and  district  offices  of  the  Registrar  General.  In  addition,  other  priorities  for \nreconstruction  of  public  administration  infrastructure  would  include  Grama  Niladhari  Office\u2019s, \nand provincial, district or divisional secretariat offices in tsunami-affected areas as identified by \nthe Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n29. \nThe  MOJ  would  be  the  executing  agency  for  this  component,  and  would  also  be  the \nimplementing  agency  for  subcomponents  (i)  to  (iii).  The  implementing  agencies  for  the \nremaining subcomponents would be as follows: \n \n\nSubcomponent (iv) - The Registrar General\u2019s Department;  \nSubcomponent (v) \u2013 the Department of the Registration of Persons;  \nSubcomponent (vi) - The Office of the President; and \nSubcomponent (vii) \u2013 MOF. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nFor  this  component,  a  project  office,  led  by  a  coordinator/director,  and  supported  by \n30. \nsufficient staff to adequately conduct the component activities, would be established within the \nMOJ.  \n \nTo  coordinate  this  component,  a  coordinating  committee  will  be  established,  and  will \n31. \nmeet bimonthly. It will be chaired by the Secretary, MOJ, and comprised of representatives from \nthe Ministry of Public Security, Law and Order, the MOFP, the Ministry of Public Administration \nand  Home  Affairs,  the  Registrar  General\u2019s  Department,  the  Department  of  the  Registration  of \nPersons,  the  Office  of  the  President,  including  representatives  from  the  Department  of  Policy, \nResearch and Information Unit media, the project coordinator/director, SPC and NEPC, and any \nother relevant persons.  \n \nTo coordinate the provision of legal and administrative infrastructure with Component E \n32. \nand Component H, a representative from the MOJ, and the Ministry of Public Administration and \nHome  Affairs,  and  the  project  coordinator/director  of  this  component  may  attend  the  national \nproject  coordination  committee  meetings,  and  the  provincial  project  coordination  committee \nmeetings.  \n \nH. \n\nGovernment and Development Partners: ADB\u2019s Approach \n\nADB\u2019s focus under this component will be to assist the government, in particular through \n33. \nthe MOJ, to provide a streamlined and coordinated approach to responding to the legal, public \nadministration, justice and governance issues arising in the wake of the tsunami.  \n \nTo  coordinate  this  Component  with  the  efforts  of  the  Government  and  development \n34. \npartners, ADB has had discussions on different aspects of this Component with the Office of the \nPresident, the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen), the Attorney General, the Secretary, \nand  Additional  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Judicial  Reforms,  the  Provincial \nGovernments of the North East and the South, the Legal Aid Commissioner, senior members of \nthe  Sri  Lankan  judiciary,  the  Asia  Foundation,  the  United  Nations  Commission  on  Human \nRights,  the  Registrar  General,  the  Commissioner  of  the  Registration  of  Persons,  and \nrepresentatives  from  professional  associations,  including  the  Retired  Judges  Association  and \nthe International Development Law Association, all of whom who have expressed their particular \nsupport for  different aspects of the work.  As the government and these development partners \nare continuing work in related areas, there will be a need to continue coordination to ensure that \ngovernment and development partner activities continue to complement each others activities.  \nAs  for  other  aspects  of  TAARP,  ADB  will  support  the  Government,  by  coordinating  with  other \ndevelopment partners, to perform a gap-financing role where Government, or tsunami-affected \npeoples\u2019  needs,  including  governance  and  anti-corruption  requirements,  would  otherwise  go \nunmet.  \n \n35. \nThe  Legal  Aid  Commission  has  a  number  of  offices  in  tsunami-affected  areas, \nparticularly  in  the  South,  the  West  and  in  Colombo.    Prior  to  the  tsunami,  the  United  Nations \nCommission on Human Rights has been coordinating with the Human Rights Commission and \nprovided  legal  assistance  in  the  North  East,  originally  in  conjunction  with  the  Legal  Aid \nCommission. ADB received a particularly strong request for post-tsunami legal assistance and \ndispute resolution support from the Provincial Government in the North and East also received \nsimilar requests in the South, and from others, in order to cope with the magnitude of tsunami \nissues. In addition, the UNDP has an Equal Access to Justice Project conducted in cooperation \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Constitutional  Affairs  and  National  Integration  in  Sri  Lanka.  It  has \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n81\n\ncommenced providing roving mobile legal assistance to obtain legal papers in certain tsunami-\naffected districts.  \n \n36. \nIn  relation  to  dispute  resolution,  the  Asia  Foundation  has  successfully  worked  with  the \nMOJ  over  a  period  of  years  to  establish  statutory  Mediation  Boards,  which  are  regarded  as  a \nsuccessful means of resolving private legal disputes. The Asia Foundation will continue to work \nwith  the  MOJ  post-tsunami,  in  responding  with  Mediation  Boards,  particularly  training  of \nmediators.  \n \n37. \nConsistent with the sector approach adopted for the entire Project, ADB\u2019s assistance will \nseek  to  support  good  governance,  anti-corruption,  and  the  legal  and  public  administrative \ninfrastructure  through  cofinance,  and  gap  filling  in  geographical  or  conceptual  areas  not  yet \ncovered,  and  in  areas where  ADB  has  a  comparative  advantage.  ADB  will  actively  coordinate \nwith  development  partners  and  the  government,  minimize  duplication,  encourage  co-financing \nand  have  a  catalytic  effect  on  the  provision  of  additional  resources.  To  provide  against  the \nduplication of efforts, the allocation of ADB funds for this component may be adjusted to ensure \ndelivery of a balanced and demand-responsive governance assistance.  \n \nI. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nImmediately  after  the  effective  date,  the  MOJ  will  establish  a  first  generation  grant \n38. \nimprest  account  at  the  Central  Bank.  This  account  will  fund  the  second-generation  imprest \naccount  to  be  established  for  the  Office  of  the  President  at  a  bank  to  be  agreed  upon  by  the \nMOJ  and  ADB.    The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  first  generation  grant  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  10%  of  the  Grant  Amount  for  Component  A,  or  the  estimated \nexpenditure for the succeeding 6 months whichever is less.  The advance to be deposited into \nthis imprest account shall not exceed $50,000, or the estimated expenditure for the succeeding \n6 months whichever is less. \n \n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nTable A7.1: Priority Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program for Courts and Judges \nQuarters in Tsunami-affected Disaster Areas \n\nLocation \n\nType of Building \n\nPublic Service \nAffected \n\nRupees \n(million) \n\nBalapitiya \n\nBalapitiya \nGalle Fort \n\nMatara  \n\nMatara  \nMatara \nMatara Fort \nMatara \n\nMagistrates Bungalow (Galle \nRoad) \nCourt Building \nGalle Court Buildings \nMagistrates Bungalow (Beach \nRoad) \nHigh Court  \nDistrict Court \nCourt Buildings \nLabor Tribunals \n\nCourt Function \n\nCourt Function \nCourt Function \n\nResidence Facility \n\nCourt Function \nCourt Function \nCourt Function \nL.T.

ADB\u2019s  interventions  in  these  projects  seek  to  comprehensively \naddress these risks and balance the need for expeditious processing of ADB\u2019s assistance, while \nensuring and maintaining the integrity of the post-tsunami and post-conflict reconstruction and \nrehabilitation programs through a number of special project design features.  \n \nA. \n \nEnsuring  good  governance  and  anticorruption  measures  are  key  features  of  ADB\u2019s \n2. \npoverty reduction strategy and are priorities in all ADB-financed projects. The volume and scale \nof foreign assistance now being contributed to Sri Lanka could lead to governance breakdown \nand weaknesses in the law and administration of justice system. The size of public donor and \nprivate  contributions  provide  opportunities  for  private  individuals  and  public  officials  to  take \nadvantage of people made vulnerable by the tsunami. The loss of documents and records, such \nas  property  titles,  birth  certificates,  death  certificates,  and  identification  cards  make  such \nopportunities  even  more  likely.  Individuals  have  already  reportedly  assumed  multiple  personal \nidentities to register for relief at more than one location. The final resolution of property disputes, \nand the award of custody of children can only be resolved in Sri Lankan courts, which is likely to \nencumber  a  legal  system  already  overburdened  with  delayed  cases,  and  may  exacerbate \ninadequacies.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nTAARP  and  NECORD-II  seek  to  confront  these  risks  with  a  series  of  measures  that \nemphasize  the  transparency,  participation,  and  accountability  required  under  the  disaster \npolicy.1 \n \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Strategies  \n\n1. \n\nAccounting and Procurement  \n\n \n4. \nAccounting  Capacity.  The  capacity  of  the  projects\u2019  project  management  units  and \ndistrict project management units to follow good accounting practices is being strengthened by \nhiring  more  accountants.  Accounting  training  will  be  provided  to  further  strengthen  capacity. \nGood financial practice supports sound management and governance.  \n \n5. \nProcurement. ADB has been advising the National Procurement Agency on measures \nto  streamline  and  accelerate  procurement  without  sacrificing  transparency  and  competition. \nConsultant  support  will  be  provided  through  TAARP  to  continue  and  formalize  procedural \nimprovements without compromising integrity.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSupervision and Monitoring  \n\n \n6. \nSupervision  and  Monitoring.  As  required  by  the  disaster  policy,  TAARP  and \nNECORD-II  provide  for  additional  supervision  and  monitoring.  Internal  regular  and  random \nsupervision  and  monitoring  are  required.  Specific  requirements  for  community  participation  in \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. Para. 108.  \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n85\n\nthe  selection,  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  subprojects  are  included.  Such \nmonitoring and community participation have been budgeted into each project\u2019s costs.  \n \n7. \nAudits. TAARP and NECORD-II provide for private sector financial auditors, in order to \nhave audited accounts provided to ADB within 6 months of the end of the financial year rather \nthan the usual 9 months. TAARP and NECORD II also provide for special and random financial \nand  performance  audits  to  ensure  that  finances  are  used  for  their  intended  purposes.  These \ninclude spot and random audits, and semiannual external performance audits, which have been \nincluded  within  the  project  costs.  As  required  by  the  disaster  policy,  TAARP  and  NECORD-II \nprovide for a special post-completion audit to address governance, financial accountability, and \ntransparency. These will be funded by the Government.  \n \n\n3. \n\nTransparency \n\nTsunami Assistance Information. The TAARP will help the Government  \n\nestablish  an  internet  website  that  describes  or  has  links  to  tsunami  assistance \nand the administration of funds under all tsunami assistance projects in order to \nprovide  the  public  with  information  and  ensure  that  funds  are  used  for  the \nintended beneficiaries and purposes; \n\npublish  such  information  in  Sinhala,  Tamil,  and  English  in  the  Government\u2019s \nLakehouse Group of newspapers;  \n\n \n8. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nprovide  information  concerning  tsunami  affected  people  and  communities  that \nwill receive assistance, and the contract details for each contract to be procured \nunder  the  TAARP,  on  the  tsunami  website,  and  in  a  readily  accessible  public \nplace  in  each  tsunami-affected  project  area,  and  in  each  PMU  office,  and  in \ngovernment newspapers.  \n\n \n9. \nIdentification Cards. TAARP will help the Government, through the Department of the \nRegistrar  of  Persons,  reissue  tsunami-affected  people  with  a  national  identification  card.  The \ndepartment  is  now  reissuing  these  cards,  but  TAARP  will  provide  computers  to  modernize \nrecords, and incidental support. If required, TAARP will also provide for mobile-van services to \nvisit  tsunami-affected  areas.  In  the  short  term,  temporary  identification  cards  for  tsunami-\naffected  people  are  planned  to  be  issued  and provided,  as  an  important  measure  to  minimize \nfalse claims for assistance, and in order to assist tracking of applications for other documents \nand assistance.  \n \n\n4. \n\nParticipation \n\n \n10. \nLocal  Stakeholders.  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  will  facilitate  an  extensive  consultative \nand participatory process in subproject selection, design, implementation, and monitoring. Local \nstakeholders are involved in subproject selection, preparation, and implementation. Civil-society \norganizations  (CSOs)  and  NGOs  will  be  represented  on  the  provincial  project  coordination \ncommittee that approves the selection of subprojects. Different CSOs and NGOs will be eligible \nto be engaged as performance monitors, and any CSO or NGO engaged in providing goods or \nservices under each project will be subject to audit.  \n \n11. \nDevelopment  Partners.  ADB  has  coordinated  closely  with  other  donors,  including  the \nWorld Bank, JBIC, and other bilateral partners, international organizations, including the United \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nNations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees,  the  Government,  and  provincial  and  local \ngovernments, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, NGOs (including the Asia Foundation), and \nother  stakeholders  to  ensure  effective  delivery  of  tsunami  assistance,  avoid  duplication  and \nobtain synergies.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAccountability \n\n \n12. \nLegal  Facilitation  and  Assistance.  TAARP  will  establish  a  centrally  coordinated, \ndecentralized  system  for  providing  legal  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  people  to  ensure  that \nthey can obtain lost documents, and are aware of the avenues for resolving family, custody, and \nproperty disputes resulting from the tsunami.  \n \nCorruption Sanctioning. Under TAARP, and NECORD II, the Government has agreed \n13. \nto  quickly  sanction  private  individuals,  entities,  or  public  officials  who  take  or  attempt  to  take \nadvantage of donor funds or the vulnerability of tsunami-affected people, in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s policy of zero tolerance for corruption specifically in tsunami-related activities.  \n \n14. \nBribery and Corruption Commission. Under TAARP, the Government has agreed to \nestablish  a  division  within  the  administrative  division  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Bribery  and  Corruption \nCommission,  to  concentrate  on  the  detection,  investigation,  and  response  to  tsunami-related \ncorruption.  \n \n15. \nParliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) / Tsunami Ombudsmen. TAARP would \nsupport  either  the  extension  of  the  existing  ombudsmen\u2019s  role  to  cover  grievances  against \npublic  officials  related  to  the  tsunami,  or  establish  a  decentralized  office  of  the  tsunami \nombudsmen to do so, if requested by the Government.  \n \n16.  Mediation Boards. TAARP would support a decentralized system of dispute resolution \nin tsunami-affected areas to deal with the anticipated increase in tsunami-related disputes. It will \nsettle private disputes and may deal with citizen grievance against governments.  \n \n17.  Modernization and Streamlining of Government Manual Record-keeping Systems. \nTAARP  supports  the  computer  automation  of  manual  systems  of  tsunami-related  information, \nthus increasing reliability and predictability of access to such information, limiting the extent to \nwhich the system can be manipulated for false claims for assistance, and increasing the extent \ntsunami affected people can claim public accountability for administration of records. \n \n\n6. \n\nPredictability \n\nin \n\nReconstruction  of  Legal \n\n \n18. \nInfrastructure.  Quasi-judicial  mechanisms  only  work \neffectively  in  the  shadow  of  the  formal  legal  system.  The  immediate  needs  for  reconstructing \ndamaged  courts \nlaw \ntsunami-affected  areas  would  be  rehabilitated, \nenforcement  structures.  TAARP  permits  certain  urgent  reconstruction  of  courthouses,  prisons, \nand police stations.  \n \n19. \nJudicial/Magistrate and Law Enforcement Officer Training Workshops. Judges and \nmagistrates  in  tsunami-affected  areas  will  need  orientation  on  any  new  tsunami  related \nlegislation,  and  on  the  likely  property  and  child-custody  cases  that  are  likely  to  arise.  TAARP \nprovides support for this.  \n \n\ntogether  with \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n87\n\nReconstruction  of  Administrative \n\nInfrastructure.  The  Registrar  General\u2019s \n20. \nDepartment,  that  registers  births,  deaths,  and  marriages,  will  be  supported  in  reconstructing \nbirth,  death,  and  marriage  records,  as  well  as  property  title  documents  by  purchasing  filing \ncabinets,  computer  technology,  and  photocopiers  for  the  Central  Records  Room  in  Colombo. \nTAARP will permit urgent reconstruction of the Matara and Mullaittivu land and district registry \noffices  of  the  Registrar  General  and  the  damaged  civil  registration  section  of  the  divisional \nsecretariats of the Registrar General in Welligama, Hikkaduwa, and Pottuvil.  \n \nPublic  Knowledge  of  the  Law.  By  facilitating  publication  in  newspapers  and  the \n21. \ninternet of tsunami-related laws passed, and a public and district official awareness campaign, \nTAARP promotes predictability.  \n \n\n\f88          Appendix 9a\n\nTSUNAMI AFFECTED AREAS REBUILDING PROJECT\nDetailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\nProject Tsunami\n\nCost\nTotal\n\nGrant\n\nADF\nReallocation\nFX\nLC\n\nGovernment\n & Beneficiaries\n\nA.\n\nB.\n\nC.\n\nD.\n\nE.\n\nF.\n\nLegal Assistance and Governance\nLegal Facilitation and Assistance\nFinancial Audit Support\nSubtotal A\n\nNorth East Coastal Community Development\nCommunity Based\nEquipment\nLivelihood Grant\nTraining (community)\nConsulting Services\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nTax and Duties\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal B\n\nRoad Rehabilitation and Reconstruction\nCivil Works\nConsulting Services\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nTax and Duties\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal C\n\nWater Supply and Sanitation\nCivil Works\nEquipment\nConsulting Services\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nTax and Duties\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal D\n\nSouthern Project Reconstruction\nCivil Works\nCommunity Based\nEquipment\nConsulting Services\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nTax and Duties\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal E\n\nCoastal Resources Management\nCivil Works\nEquipment\nEnvironmental Management\nFisheries Assistance\nConsulting Services\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nTax and Duties\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal F\n\n1.9\n0.3\n2.2\n\n17.4\n1.0\n2.7\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n2.0\n24.0\n4.0\n28.0\n\n101.3\n4.0\n0.1\n3.6\n109.0\n21.2\n130.2\n\n8.0\n1.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.8\n10.2\n2.1\n12.3\n\n15.0\n2.0\n2.0\n0.4\n0.1\n0.8\n20.3\n4.5\n24.8\n\n10.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n0.4\n0.1\n0.7\n15.2\n2.7\n17.9\n\n1.9\n0.3\n2.2\n\n17.4\n1.0\n2.7\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n1.7\n23.7\n\n23.7\n\n51.6\n2.0\n0.1\n1.5\n55.2\n\n55.2\n\n8.0\n1.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.7\n10.1\n\n10.1\n\n15.0\n2.0\n2.0\n0.4\n0.1\n0.7\n20.2\n\n20.2\n\n10.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n0.4\n0.1\n0.6\n15.1\n\n15.1\n\n49.7\n2.0\n0.0\n1.5\n53.2\n\n53.2\n\n0.3\n0.3\n4.0\n4.3\n\n0.6\n0.6\n21.2\n21.8\n\n0.1\n0.1\n2.1\n2.2\n\n0.1\n0.1\n4.5\n4.6\n\n0.1\n0.1\n2.7\n2.8\n\n\fAppendix 9a          89\n\nTSUNAMI AFFECTED AREAS REBUILDING PROJECT\nDetailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\nProject Tsunami\n\nCost\nTotal\n\nGrant\n\nADF\nReallocation\nFX\nLC\n\nGovernment\n & Beneficiaries\n\nG.\n\nH.\n\nRural Finance\nCredit\nConsulting Services\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nInterest During Implementation\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal G\n\nNECORD-Tsunami\nCivil Works\nCommunity Based\nEquipment\nConsultancy\nPerformance Audit Support\nProject Management/Incremental Exp.\n\nTaxes and Duties\n\nBase Cost\n\nSubtotal H\n\nTotal Project Costs\nFinancing Plan\nFinancing Percentage\n\n6.2\n0.1\n\n0.4\n6.7\n\n6.7\n\n0.3\n0.3\n\n11.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.5\n11.9\n0.3\n12.2\n\n5.0\n11.0\n1.1\n0.2\n0.1\n1.2\n18.6\n3.1\n21.7\n\n5.0\n0.0\n0.1\n0.0\n5.1\n\n5.1\n\n5.0\n11.0\n1.1\n0.2\n0.1\n1.0\n18.4\n\n18.4\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.2\n3.1\n3.3\n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, FX = foreign exchange, LC = local currency, NECORD = North East Community Restoration\nDevelopment Project.\n\n249.3\n\n150.0\n150.0\n60.2%\n\n0.3\n\n7.0\n2.8%\n\n6.7\n\n53.2\n53.2\n21.3%\n\n39.1\n39.1\n\n15.7%\n\n\fTable A9b.1: Detailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan -

The  recovery  and  rebuilding  process \ninvolves  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  housing,  health  facilities,  schools,  water \nsupplies,  irrigation  facilities,  roads,  coastal  structures,  fisheries  infrastructure,  government \noffices,  and  institutional  infrastructure.  Most  of  the  works  associated  with  rebuilding  the  above \nwill  occur  on  preexisting  sites.  However,  some  rebuilding  in  the  course  of  either  project  might \ntake place on government land or land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act.  \n \n3. \nDamage caused by the tsunami on individual properties and livelihoods has exacerbated \nthe damage caused by ethnic conflicts in some locations in the Northern and Eastern provinces. \nAccording to the initial needs assessments,1 the tsunami has destroyed about 100,000 houses, \nand partially damaged over 46,000 houses. Pre-tsunami ethnic conflicts had damaged over the \n50,000  houses  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.2  The  tsunami-affected  people  live  in  temporary \ncamps.  The  Government\u2019s  initiative  for  the  tsunami-affected  people  is  to  provide  (i)  livelihood \ngrant  to  restart  livelihoods,  (ii)  a  housing  grant  and  loan  to  rebuild  the  destroyed  or  damaged \nhouse,  and  (iii)  a  plot  of  land  for  those  who  are  relocated.  The  Tsunami-affected  Areas \nRebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  will  assist \ntsunami-affected \nhouseholds  in  situ\u2014to  their  original  places  of  residence\u2014through  cash  grants  in  accordance \nwith  current  tsunami  housing  reconstruction  policy  for  rebuilding  their  shelter.  As  part  of  the \ncommunity  development  subcomponents  under  the  TAARP,  assistance  will  be  provided  to \nhouseholds  for  assistance  in  restarting  their  livelihoods.  TAARP  will  rebuild  damaged  basic, \ncommunity,  and  institutional  infrastructure  in  the  tsunami-affected  areas.  Through  the  North \nEast  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  II  (NECORD-II),  the  Government  will \nreconstruct damaged in conflict-affected areas, assist the rehabilitation of basic needs such as \nhealth,  education,  irrigation,  agriculture,  replace  damaged  or  destroyed  shelter  in  situ,  and \nrebuild community infrastructure and income-generating programs.  \n \n4. \nThe tsunami affected a few communities of coastal Veddas\u2014indigenous people\u2014in the \nTrincomalee  district  of  the  Eastern  Province.  The  TAARP  will  address  their  specific  needs,  if \nnecessary,  in  the  context  of  their  specific  social  and  cultural  system.  In  such  case,  an \nindigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) will be prepared to address the potential impacts \non  these  communities  according  to  the  agreed  indigenous  peoples  development  framework \n(IPDF), included as Appendix 15.  \n \n\nthe  Government \n\nin  returning \n\n                                                 \n1   A  joint  needs  assessment  commenced  in  early  January  2005,  and  the  preliminary  report  was  presented  on  28 \nJanuary  2005.  The  needs  assessment  is  attached  as  a  supplementary  appendix  to  the  Report  and \nRecommendation to the President.  \n\n2   Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  ADB,  United  Nations,  and  World  Bank.  2003.  Sri  Lanka  Assessment  of  Needs  in  the \n\nConflict Affected Areas. Colombo.   \n\n\f94 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nProject Components with Resettlement Impacts  \n\nCombined,  the  projects  will  assist  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  about  7,000 \n5. \nhouses, enabling some tsunami-affected households to return to their original residences. The \nbeneficiary selection and housing grants will be in accordance with the Government\u2019s policy3 on \ntsunami  reconstruction.  The  housing  program  will  be  supplemented  by  the  programs  of  basic \nsocial  infrastructures,  livelihood  improvement,  and  gender  development.  Social  infrastructure \nincludes the rebuilding of damaged roads, coastal structures, and fisheries harbors.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nHousing.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Government  will  assist  the  tsunami-affected \nhouseholds  to  rebuild  their  dwellings,  where  they  existed  when  the  tsunami  hit  them  in \nDecember 2004. The housing program is of two components: a cash grant and access to easy-\nterm  loans.4  Each  tsunami-affected  household  at  eligible  locations  will  receive  a  phased \npayment of a cash grant (different grants for fully damaged and partially damaged houses), and \nan  additional  housing  loan.  The  timing,  pace,  content,  and  extent  of  house  rebuilding  will  be \nmanaged  by  the  household  with  the  assistance  of  civil-society  organizations  (CSOs)  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  Government  will  provide  relevant  information  on \npossible  house  type  plans,  construction  costs  and  techniques,  and  access  to  demonstration \nunits5.  Local  CSOs  will  coordinate  the  housing  program,  and  such  coordination  will  include \ninterface  between  households,  local  governments,  building  material  suppliers  and  local  micro \nand small-scale building contractors.  \n \n7. \nSome  locations  may  need  large-scale  reconstruction,  and  as  a  result,  will  require  the \nengagement  of  centralized  and  large-scale  building  contractors  (footnote  5).  Rehabilitation  of \nsuch communities may require the relocation of all households. For such relocation, the Urban \nDevelopment  Authority  (UDA)  has  identified  Government  land,  Government  agency-owned \nland, and private land. Most of the land for relocation will be unoccupied Government land. In \nthe  event  that  suitable  Government  land  is  not  available,  UDA  will  acquire  land  under  Land \nAcquisition  Act  through  consultation  and  negotiations  and  will  pay  the  land  its  replacement \nvalue, as prescribed by the national involuntary resettlement policy. In such cases, the guiding \nprinciples  will  be,  to  the  extent  possible,  to  keep  the  tsunami-affected  communities  at  their \noriginal locations. The main guiding principle in allocating land plots is that all tsunami-affected \nhouseholds will be given to both titled and non-titled households.  \n \n8. \ncommunity-level programs:  \n \n\nThe  following  operational  principles  will  be  applied  in  implementing  the  above \n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAt  resettlement  sites,  tsunami-affected  communities  will  involve  in  selecting  new \nlocations  for  community  infrastructure  and  housing  and  in  deciding  layout  and \ninfrastructure  designs.  This  process  will  be  facilitated  by  CSOs,  chosen  by \ntsunami-affected communities.  \nEach household will supervise and manage the construction of its dwelling at its \noriginal site or on the assigned land plot.  \n\n                                                 \n3   The Government provides livelihood and housing grant through the Unified Assistance Scheme.  \n4   Sri Lanka\u2019s experience with housing reconstruction after the large-scale flooding in the Southern Province (where \naround 17,000 houses are being assisted through cash grants) and lessons learned during the preparation of the \nWorld Bank-supported North East Housing Reconstruction Project (NEHRP) support this approach. \n\n5   The  Urban  Development  Authority  of  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Water  Supply  has  recommended  four \ntypes  of  houses\u2014single-story  detached  houses  on  individual  land  plots,  single-story  attached  houses  with \nindividual gardens, two-story attached terraced houses with individual gardens and multi-story walk-up apartments. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n95\n\n(iii) \n\nIf  large-scale  reconstruction  is  involved,  community  input  will  be  obtained  in \nchoosing building type and floor plan and in construction supervision.  \n\n(iv)  The elderly, the disabled, households headed by women, and/or households that \nare  unable  to  manage  cash  grants  or  loans  will  be  directly  assisted  by  UDA  to \nconstruct houses. Such households will not be isolated, and to the extent possible \nwill  be  encouraged  to  remain  with  their  original  communities.  Provisions  will  be \nprovided  for  tsunami-affected  women  to  obtain  housing  grants  and  livelihood \nrestoration assistance.  \nTitles  of  new  land  plots,  housing  and  other  structures  and  livelihood  assistance \nsuch  as  fishing  boats  will  be  registered  as  household  assets  of  the  tsunami-\naffected persons\u2014husband and wife as co-owners.  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  House  construction  will  consider  the  possibility  of  using  local  building  materials \nand  local  manpower  as  far  as  possible.  To  minimize  the  cost  to  the  natural \nenvironment and natural resources, alternative construction materials, particularly \nfor  sand  and  timber,  will  be  introduced.  The  construction  of  more  than  100,000 \nhouseholds will demand considerable quantities of such building materials within \na very short period of time.  \n\n \n9. \nIn housing programs, particularly in large-scale community-driven housing programs, the \nconstruction process will be streamlined. Three processes in this regard are critical: (i) a large \nnumber of tsunami-affected households lost their land titles, bank documents, and identification \ncards.  This  situation  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  in  some  districts  land  registries  were \ndamaged, and official records were destroyed by the tsunami. In such cases, a mechanism will \nbe established to ensure that such factors would not unduly delay recovery and reconstruction. \n(ii) A concise, clear and simplified building codes applicable to the reconstruction process will be \ndeveloped.  Such  building  codes  will  be  adopted  and  will  be  widely  disseminated  among  the \ntsunami-affected  households.  (iii)  An  accelerated  process  to  institutionalize  the  issuance  of \nbuilding permits at local, district, and provincial levels will be established.  \n \n10. \nThree issues in respect of construction sector facilitation that need special attention are \n(i) supply of skilled labor at construction sites: initiatives will be provided to support the training \nof skilled construction workers (such as masons, carpenters, plumbers and electricians) through \nvocational training institutional network and through CSOs; (ii) construction materials: Sri Lanka \nwill  require  the  support  of  materials  and  equipment  supply  chains;  (iii)  environmental \nmanagement:  an  appropriate  environmental  management  response  for  lime  production  will  be \ninstalled.  \n \n11. \nAssistance to Tsunami-affected Local Authorities. At most tsunami-affected coastal \nareas,  local  authorities  often  do  not  have  the  requisite  institutional  capacity  to  effectively \nmanage  large-scale  emergency  assistance  programs.  Therefore,  as  part  of  the  recovery \nprocess,  these  local  authorities  will  be  assisted  in  developing  and  mainstreaming  consultative \nand inclusive recovery strategies. Project assistance to local authorities includes resources for \ndesign,  rehabilitation  and/or  reconstruction  of  local  infrastructure  such  as  minor  roads, \npathways, solid waste management, and street lighting.  \n \n12. \nPublic  infrastructure  that  would  receive  assistance  include  national  road,  access \nroads, minor road, culverts, drains, small-scale water supply and sanitation facilities, solid waste \nmanagement,  small-scale \nrepair  sheds, \nmarket/auction  halls,  and  cold  storage  facilities.  Although  the  majority  of  construction  would \ninvolve  the  reconstruction  of  infrastructure  at  its  pre-tsunami  location,  some  could  necessitate \npermanent or temporary land acquisition.  \n\ninfrastructure  such  as  net \n\nfisheries \n\nrelated \n\n\f96 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nCoastal  Resources  Management.  The  TAARP  will  repair  damage \n\nto  coastal \n13. \nstabilization  structures  and  harbor  backwaters  in  the  Southern  and  Western  provinces  and \nenhance  coastal  protection  and  environmental  management  along  the  coast  by  reestablishing \ngreen  zones  or  green  belts  through  intensive  forestation  with  coastal  vegetation.  The \nenforcement  of  tsunami  rebuilding  policy  and  guidelines  along  the  tsunami-affected  coast  will \ndisplace  persons,  especially  the  squatters  and  encroachers.  Land  acquisition  for  coastal \nresource  management,  if  necessary,  will  follow  the  resettlement  principles  outlined  above  in \npara 8.  \n \n14. \nLivelihood  Restoration.  Under  both  projects,  livelihood  restoration  support  will  be \nprovided to enable tsunami-affected and conflict-affected households to rebuild their livelihood \nsources  or  to  learn  new  employment  skills.  This  will  be  done  by  reviving  local  economies \nthrough  the  creation  of  jobs  for  locally-based  skilled  and  unskilled  labor.  Livelihood  support \ninterventions  include  advisory  services  to  identify  and  develop  suitable  livelihood  options \nincluding small-scale enterprises, skills development, and transfer of technology. Some of these \nadvisory services will be linked with microcredit. Asset replacement support for disadvantaged \ngroups on a very competitive basis will also a part of this project component.  \n \nC. \n \nThis  resettlement  framework  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy  and \n15. \ndisaster and emergency assistance policy, and the national involuntary resettlement policy of Sri \nLanka6.  The  resettlement  framework  sets  out  the  broad  scope,  policy,  and  procedures  for \nscreening  and  formulation  of  resettlement  plans  for  subprojects  and  investments  under  both \nprojects.  The  detailed  scope  of  individual  subprojects  has  not  yet  been  defined;  however,  the \nexecuting agencies (EAs) will be required to prepare, as needed, resettlement plans according \nto this RF, and Government and ADB guidelines for subprojects with any resettlement impacts.7  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement principles applicable to the TAARP and NECORD-II are derived \n16. \nfrom ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy, the Government\u2019s national involuntary resettlement \npolicy and the Land Acquisition Act. The core principles are:  \n \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\n(i) \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided;  if  it  cannot  be  avoided,  it  will  be \nminimized.  \n\n(ii)  Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, tsunami-affected persons will be \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nassisted to reestablish themselves and improve their quality of life. \nLack  of  formal  legal  land  title  is  not  a  bar  for  compensation  and  rehabilitation \nassistance.  \nReplacement land is an option for compensation in the case of loss of land; in the \nabsence  of  replacement  land,  cash  compensation  is  the  option  for  all  affected \n\n                                                 \n6  Sri Lanka adopted a national involuntary resettlement policy (NIRP) in May 2001. Under this policy a resettlement \nplan is required if more than  20  households are affected.  The project can obtain four sets of guidelines from the \nResettlement Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Lands, Irrigation and Livestock, to assist the relevant agencies \nin  planning,  implementing,  monitoring  and  evaluating  all  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  These  are  (i)  General \nGuidelines  on  Planning  and  Implementation  of  Involuntary  Resettlement;  (ii)  Guidelines  for  the  Preparation  of  a \nResettlement  Action  Plan;  (iii)  Process  Manual  for  the  Implementation  of  the  NIRP,  Ministry  of  Land;  and  (iv) \nGuidelines for a Participatory Resettlement Process. Under the NIRP, the Resettlement Division now requires an \nacceptable RAP before approving any land acquisition for a project.  \n\n \n\n7   Resettlement impacts includes social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are (i) caused \nby acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land.  \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n97\n\npersons  (APs).  Compensation  for  the  property  acquired  will  be  paid  at  their \nreplacement value8 in addition to any transaction costs.  \nEach AP is entitled to receive assistance to restore income and livelihood at pre-\nproject  standard,  and  all  vulnerable  APs  are  entitled  to  receive  assistance  to \nimprove their income and livelihood.  \nAll  APs  will  be  fully  informed  and  consulted  on  compensation,  relocation,  and \nrehabilitation programs.  \nAPs will fully involve in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation \nand development options at the earliest opportunity.  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(viii)  All APs will be integrated economically and socially into their host communities, if \nrelocated. For this, participatory measures will be designed and implemented by \nthe EA or IA.  \nAPs\u2019 social and cultural institutions will be safeguarded and supported.  \nCommon property resources and community and public services will be provided \nto APs.  \nCompensation  and  rehabilitation  programs  will  be  carried  out  with  equal \nconsideration  for  women  and  men;  in  the  case  of  these  projects,  particular \nattention will be placed on the rights of women, widows, orphans, and the elderly, \nand other vulnerable persons and groups such as indigenous peoples and ethnic \nminorities.  Appropriate  and  sufficient  assistance  will  be  provided  to  help  them \nimprove their socioeconomic status.  \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  will  be \n\nfully  provided  before \n\napproving any subproject if it involves involuntary resettlement impacts.  \n(xiii)  The full compensation and resettlement costs are included in subproject costs.  \n\n \n17. \nAlthough  the  above  resettlement  principles  could  adequately  address  involuntary \nresettlement  arising  from  subprojects,  it  is  necessary  to  decide  the  following  policy  issues \nrelating  primarily  to  tsunami-affected  persons.  These  issues  need  policy  clarification  by  the \nGovernment:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBeneficiary identification. A national system of identifying the tsunami-affected \nhouseholds who are eligible for receiving assistance is required. The system has \nto be fair, accurate, and verifiable.  \n \u201cNo  development  zone.\u201d  Any  blanket  \u201cno  development  zone\u201d  will  impose \nmultiple  critical  impacts.  A  policy  based  on  risk  assessment,  consultations  with \nproperty  owners,  squatters,  and  informal  settlers  and  on  social,  economic,  and \nfinancial implications is required. This includes the programs associated with the \ngreening of coastal belt and other coastal conservation programs. \nBefore  permanent  houses  are  built,  it  is  necessary  to  provide  all  displaced \nhouseholds with transitory shelter. The internally displaced persons cannot live in \nmakeshift  tents  without  any  privacy  and  basic  hygienic  facilities  for  a  long  time. \nLand  acquisition,  land  development,  and  construction  of  houses,  and  other \ncommunity facilities could take long time to complete because of legal, financial, \nand institutional obstacles.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n8  Replacement cost means the cost of replacement of lost assets and income. If land, it means the cost of buying a \nreplacement  land  near  the  lost  land  with  equal  productive  potential  plus  the  cost  of  preparing  the  land  to  levels \nsimilar to those of the affected land and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If structures, it means current \nmarket value of building materials, required labor without deduction for depreciation and/or salvageable materials. \nFor crops and trees, it will be based on economic production, age and type.  \n\n\f98 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nThe application of policy and laws in the sphere of involuntary resettlement are outlined \n18. \nbelow.  The  entitlement  matrix  is  divided  into  two  components:  tsunami-caused  losses,  and \nsubproject-caused  losses.  The  entitlement  matrix  is  not  exhaustive:  more  entitlements  can  be \nadded  if  any  resettlement  impact  not  listed  in  the  matrix  is  identified  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n\nTable A12: Entitlement Matrix \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nEntitlement \n\nType of Losses \nTsunami-Caused Losses \nPermanent Loss of \nhomesteads  \n\nLoss of house and \nother structures.

A \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  a  sample  population  will  also  be  undertaken  to  identify \ndifferent  categories  of  APs,  based  on  the  degree  and  scale  of  impacts  of  the \nsubproject on them.  \nFormulate  a  time-bound  schedule  for  RP  implementation,  procedures for  grievance \nredress, monitoring and evaluation (both internal and external). \nDevelop an entitlements matrix to outline entitlements of all tsunami-affected persons \nincluding  non-titled  persons,  e.g.,  squatters,  encroachers,  and  informal  dwellers.  If \nidentified  during  project \nnew  categories  of  APs  and \nimplementation,  appropriate  entitlements  will  be  added \nthe  resettlement \nframework. \nDraft  RP  will  be  disclosed  to  all  APs.  The  EA  will  review  and  approve  it  before \nsubmitting to ADB for review and approval. It will be disclosed to all APs and posted \non ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Website.  \nThe  RP  approved  by  EA  and  ADB  will  be  implemented  before  award  of  any \nconstruction contracts of the subproject.  \n\nlosses  are \n\ntypes  of \n\nto \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \n20. \nThe executing agencies of TAARP and NECORD-II will be the ministries of finance and \nplanning;  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction;  highways;  fisheries  and  aquatic  resources; \nregional  infrastructure  development;  urban  development  and  water  supply;  and  justice.  The \nNorth East Provincial Council, Southern Provincial Council, Road Development Authority, Coast \nConservation  Department,  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  and  National \nDevelopment Trust Fund will be implementing agencies (IAs).  \n \n21. \nNational  and  provincial  and  project  coordination  committees  for  each  project  will \ncoordinate  activities  with  the  assistance  of  district  level  project  management  units  (PMUs). \nSubprojects will be selected on the basis of established criteria, as established in Appendixes \n5a  and  5b.  Formulation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  RPs  of  subprojects  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  concerned  EA  and  IA  and  their  PMU,  which  will  work  under  the  overall \ncoordination of the national and provincial coordination committees. Key information on impacts, \nlocal needs and on tsunami-affected households will be provided by divisional secretaries with \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n101\n\nEligibility Provisions \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nfor  such  stakeholder  consultations.

They  will  be \nselected  in  consultation  with  ADB.  In  formulating  RPs,  the  consultants  will  follow  the  planning \nprocedures outlined in para. 8 and the entitlement matrix.  \n \nF. \n \n23. \nActivities for both projects will be conducted through a stakeholder consultation process, \nassisted by CSOs and NGOs. EAs and IAs will make sure to invite vulnerable households and \nthese \npersons \nconsultations, indicating the responsibility and time-line for implementing the decisions taken at \nsuch consultation meetings. Resettlement information during RP preparation will be disclosed to \nall APs in their own language, and their views and opinions will be taken into consideration in \nfinalizing  RPs.  Final  RPs  will  be  translated  into  local  language  and  disclosed  through  public \nnotices at PMU field offices, grama niladhari offices, and through news papers, radio, TV and on \nADB\u2019s website.  \n \nG. \n \n24. \nAll  APs  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation.  However,  eligibility  to \ncompensation and other assistance will be limited by a cut-off date to be set for each subproject \non the day corresponding to the beginning of its impacts assessment. The cut-off date defines \n\u201celigibility\u201d and \u201caffected person.\u201d APs who arrived in the subproject areas after the cut-off date \nwill not be eligible for compensation and other assistance.  \n \nH. \n \n25. \nThe  divisional  secretary  will  handle  grievances,  if  any,  in  implementing  RPs  of \nsubprojects  with  the  assistance  of  PMUs  and  grama  niladhari.  APs  could  appeal  against  any \ndecision  of  divisional  secretary  to  the  provincial  project  coordination  committees  and  national \nproject coordination committee. If unsatisfied, APs could seek assistance of appropriate court of \nlaw  to  redress  their  grievances.  Each  subproject  RP  will  detail  the  grievance  redress \nmechanisms.  \n \nI. \n \n26. \nEach  IA  will  conduct  its  own  internal  monitoring  of  the  subproject\u2019s  RP  implementation \nand  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  The  Provincial  Project  Coordinating  Committee  and  to \nADB for review and information. Each quarterly report will include the progress of planning and \nimplementation  of  RPs.  Sufficient  monitoring  indicators  will  be  included  in  each  RP.  A  private \nfirm, NGO, or university will be engaged by the project as an external monitoring and evaluation \nagency.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  quarterly  during  the  first  of  project \nimplementation  and  twice  a  year  from  the  second  year.  Each  RP  will  list  sufficient  number  of \nexternal monitoring indicators. These reports will be submitted to EA and ADB for review. \n \n \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n                                                 \n10  Grama Niladhari divisions or GN divisions, are the lowest level of administration within the Government.  \n\n\f102 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nResettlement Budget \n\nJ. \n \n27. \nDetailed  estimates  will  be  prepared  for  each  RP,  which  will  be  included  in  the  overall \nsubproject estimate. The budget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition, relocation, and \nlivelihood and income restoration and improvement; (ii) sources of funding; (iii) arrangements for \napproval of RP cost estimates; and (iv) the flow of funds and contingency arrangements.  \n \n28. \nAll  land  acquisition  funds  will  be  provided  by  Government.  Other  costs  such  as \ninfrastructure building at relocation sites and income and livelihood restoration and improvement \nprograms could be financed from grant funds. All land acquisition, compensation, relocation and \nrehabilitation  of  income  and  livelihood  will  be  considered  as  an  integral  component  of  project \ncosts.  \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n103\n\n \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe Tsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) and the North East Community \n1. \nRestoration  and  Development  Project  II  (NECORD-II)  aim  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \nrebuilding efforts in the wake of the tsunami, and continuing rehabilitation efforts in the conflict-\naffected areas in the North East, respectively. Subprojects will be implemented through project \nimplementation  units  (PMUs)  under  various  implementing  agencies,  all  now  in  existence  for \nother  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects.  While  most  of  the  subprojects  are  similar  in  scope  to \nongoing  projects,  a  few  that  are  not  have  been  introduced  for  possible  implementation  under \nTAARP  and  NECORD-II.  This  initial  environmental  examination  has  been  developed  for  the \nbroad framework of TAARP and NECORD-II, as they address similar reconstruction needs and \nuse  similar  approaches  to  implement  the  works.  However,  during  subproject  formulation, \nenvironmental  concerns  will  be  studied  in  further  detail.  An  environmental  assessment \nframework has been developed (Appendix 12) to ensure that subprojects follow environmental \nassessment  procedures,  in  keeping  with  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  environmental \nassessment regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  will  reconstruct  damaged  or  destroyed  infrastructure  and \nessential services primarily by providing civil works, equipment, and consulting services. TAARP \nwill introduce measures to enhance environmental protection along the coastal belt. Subprojects \ninclude  rehabilitating  damaged  roads  ranging  from  classes  A  to  E;1  rehabilitating  basic \ncommunity  infrastructure  (schools,  hospitals,  housing,  health  facilities,  and  local  government \nirrigation  schemes;2  preparing  and \nbuildings, \nrehabilitating \nimplementing  village  development  plans;  providing  support \nlivelihood  activities; \nreconstructing coastal protection interventions such as groins, revetments, and embankments; \nrehabilitating  damaged  harbors;  enhancing  coastal  protection  by  reestablishing  vegetation  in \ncoastal  zones;  and  expanding  and  rehabilitating  community  water  supply  and  sanitation \nschemes. TAARP will support rural microfinance credit schemes.  \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nincluding  small  markets); \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nfor \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n3. \nSri Lanka sits on a narrow continental shelf 45 kilometers (km) wide in the northeastern \nand northwestern coasts and 8 km along the southeastern and eastern coasts. The country has \nan  area  of  44,250  square  kilometers.  The  northern  shelf  merges  with  India,  forming  an \nextensive  shallow  bank  consisting  of  the  Gulf  of  Mannar,  Palk  Strait,  and  Pedro  Bank.  The \ncoastline is 1,770 km.  \n \n4. \nThe  climate  is  influenced  by  two  monsoon  and  two  inter-monsoon  periods.  The \nsouthwest  monsoon,  which  occurs  from  May  to  September,  is  associated  with  cyclonic  wind \ncirculations  or  depressions  and  is  marked  by  heavy  rainfall,  especially  in  the  southwestern \nseaboard. The northeast monsoon occurs from December to February, and is characterized by \nheavy rainfall more or less confined in the northeastern half of the country, with wind generally \n\n                                                 \n1   All road rehabilitation will be within the existing right-of-way and will not include widening or realignment.  \n2   Irrigation works will not involve changes or diversion of natural watercourse.  \n\n\f104 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\ncoming from an easterly direction. Wind becomes generally light during the two inter-monsoon \nperiods\u2014March  to  April,  and  October  to  November.  The  average  temperature  of  the  project \narea ranges from 290C to 370C.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n5. \nThe  natural  ecosystems  within  the  coastal  zone  are  diverse  and  include  lagoons  and \nestuaries,  coral  reefs,  mangrove  swamps,  seagrass  beds,  other  wetlands  and  dune  systems. \nThe  country\u2019s  principal  coral  reef  systems  are  composed  of  fringing  reefs  close  to  the  shore. \nSeveral  offshore  reefs  are  on  the  continental  shelf  off  the  northwestern  coast.  Destructive \nfishing  practices  and  human-induced  activities  such  as  siltation  and  pollution  have  led  to  the \ndestruction of the coral reefs. Cumulative damage to mangroves in Sri Lanka has resulted from \noverutilization of the resource and the transformation of large areas for other uses. Mangroves \nhave been converted for aquaculture, coconut, and paddy cultivation, and reclaimed for housing \nand  urban  expansion.  The  impact  the  tsunami  has  had  on  these  natural  systems  is  yet  to  be \nstudied.  \n \n6. \nSri Lanka is estimated to have over 23,800 hectares of salt marsh lands. Salt marshes in \nthe north are found mostly on tidal flats, while in the south, they occur mainly in low areas on the \nsheltered  sides  of  sand  dunes.  The  coastal  marshes  and  wetlands  are  feeding  grounds  for \nmigratory waterfowl. Within the tsunami- and conflict-affected areas, around 15 sites have been \nformally designated as protected areas and sanctuaries.  \n \n7. \nand Portuguese forts.  \n \n\nCultural  landmarks  include  temples,  mosques,  churches,  and  16th\u201317th-century  Dutch \n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n \nThe main economic activities of the affected communities are fisheries and tourism. The \n8. \ncontribution  of  fisheries,  hotels,  and  restaurants  together  is  only  3%  to  GDP.  However,  the \ncoastal  economy  is  largely  dependent  on  these  sectors  and  many  of  the  small  informal \nbusinesses in these areas also service these industries. The agriculture sector in these regions, \nwhich  was  less  affected,  consists  of  small-scale  farmers. The coastal communities are largely \npoor, with the North East communities suffering from the added burden of a 20-year civil war.  \n \n9. \nHuman development in Sri Lanka is higher than in comparable countries, with a literacy \nrate  of  92%  and  life  expectancy  at  73  years.  The  net  enrolment  rate  in  primary  education  is \n96%.  Even  in  the  poor  regions  the  level  of  human  development  is  satisfactory  due  to  the \nuniversal  free  education  and  health  policies  that  the  country  has  followed  for  a  long  time. \nHowever, the quality of facilities differs greatly across the regions, and poor communities have \nless access to higher education and good medical services.  \n \nD. \n \nAs the main focus of each project is to rehabilitate or rebuild infrastructure and essential \n10. \nservices  damaged  or  destroyed  either  by  the  tsunami  or  the  conflict,  an  overall  positive \nenvironmental impact is expected.  \n \nReconstruction  works  of  almost  all  infrastructure  facilities,  including  harbors,  markets, \n11. \nschools, other than some individual housing, will be at original sites. Roads will be through the \noriginal right-of-way, and a change in alignment or widening of roads is not anticipated. Coastal \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n105\n\n \n\nInstitutional Requirements, Environmental Mitigation, and Monitoring Plan \n\nstabilization  will  focus  on  replacing  displaced  boulders  and  reconstructing  groins  and \nrevetments. Water supply and sanitation subprojects will focus on repairing damaged structures \nand  extending  the  coverage.  Negative  environmental  impacts  during  construction,  including \nincreased  dust,  noise,  temporary  disruption  of  traffic  flow,  and  soil  erosion,  will  be  short  term \nand can be mitigated by suitable construction practices. Measures to minimize the impacts will \nbe included in the contract documents. A resettlement framework has been developed to ensure \nthat  any  resettlement  that  may  occur  under  the  projects  will  follow  the  procedures  laid  out  in \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).  \n \n12. \nApart  from  reconstruction  works,  measures  to  improve  the  environment  will  be \nincorporated  into  the  subproject  designs.  Reestablishing  coastal  green  belts  with  suitable \nvegetation is proposed. Immediately after the tsunami, NGOs and local government authorities \nhelped  sort  and  dispose  of  the  large  quantities  of  waste.  While  the  tsunami-affected \ncommunities have salvaged whatever building materials that could be reused, large quantities of \nconstruction debris\u2014broken bricks, concrete\u2014remain stockpiled. It is proposed, where feasible, \nto reuse this as core material to rebuild groins and revetments, or to crush and reuse it as sub-\nbase material for access roads to be constructed under TAARP and NECORD-II. This will help \nminimize  problems  of  waste  disposal  and  the  impacts  on  natural  resources  as  more  raw \nmaterial is used for reconstruction.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nIn  keeping  with  the  environmental  assessment  requirements  of  the  Government \nstipulated  in  the  National  Environmental  Act  and  Coast  Conservation  Act  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), subprojects determined as requiring environmental assessments will \nneed  approval  of  the  project  approving  agency  and  ADB.  An  environmental  assessment \nframework  has  been  developed  to  help  determine  which  subprojects  will  require  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE).  \n \n14. \nPreparation of the IEE and obtaining the necessary approvals will be the responsibility of \nthe PMU. The PMU must also ensure that mitigation measures identified in the environmental \nmanagement  plan  are  incorporated  during  implementation.  Contract  documents  shall  describe \nthe  environmental  obligations  of  the  contractor  and  penalties  for  noncompliance.  While  most \nPMUs under these projects are supported by consultants, or have their own staff to monitor the \nimplementation of the environmental management plan, they may obtain additional consultancy \nservices if required.  \n \n15. \nQuarterly  progress  review  reports  submitted  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  ADB \nshould include the progress of environmental monitoring and highlight any other environmental \nissues that may have arisen during implementation, and measures taken to address the issues.  \n \nF. \n \n16. \nGiven the emergency nature of TAARP, detailed public consultations in tsunami-affected \nareas  could  not  be  held  although  public  consultations  and  beneficiary  participation  are  a \nnecessary and integrated initial step in subproject selection. However, during the tsunami fact-\nfinding and needs assessment missions, consultations were held with government officials, the \nLiberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam,  NGOs,  other  bilateral  organizations,  and  a  few  tsunami-\naffected persons.  \n17. \nIn  the  planning  and  implementation  of  subprojects,  beneficiary  communities  shall  be \nconsulted  to  ensure  that  their  concerns  and  needs  are  addressed  in  the  rehabilitation  of  the \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n\f106 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures of Subprojects \n\nworks. During the consultation, project information should be shared with the beneficiaries. All \ncontractual  information  on  ongoing  subprojects  should  be  clearly  posted  at  subproject \nconstruction sites, including the exact contract amount and dates. All environmental documents \nare  subject  to  public  disclosure;  therefore,  these  documents  should  be  made  available  to  the \npublic, in accordance with ADB\u2019s public communications policy. \n \nG. \n \nThe environmental assessment and review procedures are described in Appendix 14. All \n18. \nsubprojects  related  to  rehabilitation  of  class-A  and  -B  roads,  class-C  to  -E  roads  over  5  km, \nlocal  access  roads,  harbors,  and  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes,  and  to \nresettlement  of  communities  have  been  classified  as  category-B  projects  and  require  an  IEE. \nOther  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  environmental  screening.  Subprojects  will  be  designed  so \nthat  they  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  are  in  keeping  with  the  relevant \ngovernmental laws, regulations, and standards.  \n \nH. \n \n19. \nThe  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  focus  primarily  on  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of \ninfrastructure.  Short-term,  reversible,  minor  negative  impacts  are  anticipated  as  a  result  of \nconstruction. These can be mitigated by adopting good construction practices and incorporating \nmitigatory  measures  during  design  and  construction,  and  including  clauses  in  the  contract \ndocuments. Significant environmental benefits are anticipated through subproject interventions, \nincluding  improvements  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  coastal  protection,  and  provision  of \nbasic services. TAARP and NECORD-II are environmental category-B projects. Subprojects will \nbe  subject \nthat  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are foreseen to be associated with the proposed rehabilitation work and, \ntherefore,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  of  further  impacts  of  TAARP  or \nNECORD-II is unlikely to be required.  \n \n\nto  environmental  screening.  The \n\nConclusion \n\nIEE  shows \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n107\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nSubprojects  proposed  for  the  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  and \n1. \nthe North East Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD-II) will support the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate essential infrastructure and services damaged or destroyed \nas a result of the tsunami impact and the conflict in the North East.  \n \n2. \nSubprojects  collectively  under  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  can  include  rehabilitating \ndamaged  class  A  to  class  E  roads;1  rehabilitating  basic  community  infrastructure  (schools, \nhospitals,  housing,  health  facilities,  and  local  government  buildings,  including  small  markets); \nrehabilitating  irrigation  schemes;2  preparing  and  implementing  village  development  plans; \nproviding support for livelihood activities; reconstructing coastal protection interventions such as \ngroins,  revetments,  and  embankments;  rehabilitating  damaged  harbors;  enhancing  coastal \nprotection by planting vegetation in recently declared coastal reservation zones;3 and expanding \nand  rehabilitating  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes.  TAARP  will  support  rural \nmicrofinance credit schemes. Subprojects that are part of the original scope of either project will \nfollow the environmental procedures stipulated in their loan agreements. Where subprojects do \nnot fall within the existing scope, the environmental assessment procedures to be adopted are \ndetailed in the following paragraphs.  \n \n3. \nEnvironmental assessment requirements of the Government for subprojects outside the \ncoastal zone4 are stipulated in the National Environmental Act (NEA) 47 of 1980, incorporating \namendments  by  Act  56  of  1988  and  Act  53  of  2000,  while  those  within  the  coastal  zone  are \ngoverned by the Coast Conservation Act 57 of 1981, incorporating amendment Act 64 of 1988. \nIn accordance with the NEA, environmental assessments are required for prescribed projects.5 \nPrescribed projects are identified as type (i) projects based on type and magnitude; type (ii) all \nsubprojects irrespective of their magnitude identified in (i); and type (iii) selected high-polluting \nindustries, if near culturally and/or environmentally sensitive areas defined in Table A14. Given \nthat  subprojects  focus  on  rehabilitating  infrastructure  and  services,  none  fall  within  type  (i) \nprescribed  projects.  Nevertheless,  all  subprojects  will  be  screened  for  type  (ii)  prescribed \nprojects using the checklist provided. All subproject interventions within the coastal zone require \nthe  approval  of  the  Coast  Conservation  Department  (CCD).  The  director  of  CCD  has  the \ndiscretion  to  request  the  developer  to  submit  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  In \naddition,  under  the  Fauna  and  Flora  Protection  Ordinance  2  of  1937,  amended  by  Act  49  of \n1993,  any  new  development  activity  within  1  mile  (1.609  km  of  the  boundary  of  a  national \nreserve  requires  prior  written  approval  of  the  director  of  the  Department  of  Wildlife \nConservation.  \n \nAs  both  projects  will  focus  on  restoring  facilities  damaged  or  destroyed  during  the \n4. \ntsunami  and  conflict,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003) \n                                                 \n1   All road rehabilitation will be within the existing right-of-way and will not include widening or realignment.  \n2   Irrigation works will not involve changes or diversion of natural watercourse.  \n3   The Government has proposed a 100-meter wide reservation zone. \n4   Defined in the Coast Conservation Act as \u201cthe area lying within a 300 m landwards of the mean of the mean high \nwater line and a limit of 2 km seawards of the mean low water line and in the case of rivers, streams, lagoons, or \nany  other  body  of  water  connected  to  the  sea  either  permanently  or  periodically,  the  landward  boundary  shall \nextend to a limit of 2 km measure perpendicular to the straight base line drawn between the natural entrance points \nthereof and shall include waters of such rivers, streams and lagoons or any other body of water so connected to \nthe sea.\u201d  \n\n5   Listed in Gazette Extraordinary of 772/22 of 24 June 1993.  \n\n\f108 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSubproject Selection and Environmental Assessment \n\nTo  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  the  ADB\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment \n\nand Environment Policy (2002), [all subprojects related to rehabilitation of class-A and -B roads, \nclass-C through -E roads over 5 kilometers (km), and local access roads; harbors; community \nwater supply and sanitation schemes; and resettlement of communities have been classified as \ncategory  B  subprojects  and  require  an  IEE.  All  remaining  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  an \nenvironmental screening procedure described in para. 7. Each category B subproject needs an \nIEE.  Any  category  B  subproject  falling  within  the  Government\u2019s  list  of  prescribed  projects,  or \nwithin 1.6 km of the boundary of a national reserve, will need to obtain relevant governmental \nclearances and submit them to ADB. All subprojects falling within the coastal zone will require \nprior approval of CCD.  \n \n5. \nAfter  the  tsunami,  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  issued  guidelines  for  waste \ndisposal and housing reconstruction. The project management units (PMUs) should ensure that \nall activities are in keeping with these guidelines and any new guidelines the Government may \npropose.  \n \n6. \nrequirements, the following environmental assessment framework will be adopted.  \n \nB. \n \nSubprojects for which an environmental assessment category has not been identified, as \n7. \ndefined in para. 4, will be subject to an environmental checklist (Table A14). Reconstruction for \ncoastal  areas  affected  by  the  tsunami  will  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  post-tsunami \nreconstruction  guidelines  and  regulations.  If  any  subprojects  fall  within  areas  specified  in  the \nchecklist, they will be categorized as a category B and will require an IEE.  \n \n8. \nFor  each  category  B  subproject,  a  simplified  IEE  report  must  be  submitted  to  ADB  as \npart  of  the  subproject  proposal.  The  simplified  IEE  report,  in  a  checklist  format,  developed  for \nthe  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  (NECORD)  will  be  made \navailable to the PMUs during the inception of TAARP and NECORD-II.  \n \n9. \nFor  each  category  B  subproject  in  the  sensitive  areas  (Table  A14),  the  simplified  IEE \nreport must be submitted to the project approving agency6 for clearance. Such clearance must \nbe obtained before subproject implementation.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nof potential environmental problems and risks related to each subproject:  \n \n\nThe following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \n\nResponsibilities of Implementing Agencies and ADB  \n\n1. \n\nImplementing Agencies\u2019 Responsibilities \n\n \n11. \n \n\nThe implementing agencies\u2019 responsibilities are the following: \n\n(i) \n\nthe  environmental  category  of \n\nthe \nDetermine \ncategorization  in  para.  4.

Whether  or  not  the  subproject  required  an  IEE,  basic  environmental  safeguards  to  be \nadopted  during  construction  shall  be  included  in  the  contract  documents.  For  subprojects  that \nrequire  an  IEE,  the  contract  documents  shall  also  include  clauses  for  the  implementation  of \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  as  described  in  the  IEE  report  and  the  approving  agency \nclearance (if required).  \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Responsibilities \n\nADB\u2019s responsibilities are the following: \n\n \n13. \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nReview IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects.  \nDisclose  the  findings  of  the  IEE  and  summary  IEE  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002).  \nMonitor  the  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  through  project  review \nmissions, and conduct environmental performance monitoring as necessary.  \n\nEnvironmental Performance Monitoring and Public Disclosure \n\n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  implementing  agencies  must  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake \nenvironmental monitoring of all subprojects. However, the  agencies have the full responsibility \nfor  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures described in the IEE report and approving agency clearance (if required). While most \nof  the  PMUs  under  these  projects  are  supported  by  consultants,  or  have  their  own  staff  to \nmonitor the implementation of the environmental management plan, they may obtain additional \nconsultancy services, if required.  \n \n15. \nQuarterly progress review reports submitted by the implementing agency should include \nthe progress of environmental monitoring and highlight any other environmental issues that may \nhave arisen during implementation, and measures taken to address the issues.  \n \n16. \nthat  all  environmental \nassessment  documents,  including  the  environmental  monitoring  reports,  are  maintained \nsystematically as part of the subproject record.  \n \n17. \nDuring  planning  and  implementation,  beneficiary  communities  shall  be  consulted  to \nensure  that  their  concerns  and  needs  are  addressed  in  the  rehabilitation  of  the  works.

A needs assessment has been completed to assess the damages to property, livelihood \nand  infrastructure.  In  a  response  a  request  for  emergency  assistance,  ADB  has  prepared  two \ninterlinked  projects:  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  and  North  East \nCommunity  Restoration  and  Development  Project  II  (NECORD  II)  comprising  components  of \nroads, community infrastructure and shelter, livelihood support, water supply and sanitation, and \ncoastal protection. Under these two projects, it is proposed to conduct socioeconomic surveys \nto  identify  and  evaluate  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  local  communities,  including \nindigenous  communities  who  live  in  marginalized  small  coastal  communities,  and  to  provide \nreconstruction  assistance  to  rebuild  damaged  properties  and  community  infrastructure  as  well \nas livelihood sources through a participatory strategy. The first step is to identify priority areas \nfor immediate interventions. About 150 households of indigenous people (Veddas) have thus far \nbeen  identified  as  affected  by  the  tsunami.  Many  more  Veddas  living  in  Trincomalee  and \nBatticaloa  districts  might  have  also  been  affected  by  the  tsunami;  the  number  of  affected \nindigenous  peoples  could  increase  once  the  socioeconomic  surveys  are  completed.  This \nindigenous  peoples  development  framework  (IPDF)  has  been  formulated  as  the  basis  for  any \nindigenous  peoples  development  plans  (IPDPs)  that  may  be  needed  to  address  indigenous \npeoples\u2019  issues  arising  from  the  subprojects.  The  IPDF  is  intended  to  guide  the  selection  and \npreparation  of  subprojects  under  either  project  to  ensure  better  distribution  of  benefits  to \nindigenous peoples, and rebuild their lost income sources and dwellings.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \n\u201dIndigenous peoples\u201d refers to a population with social, cultural, economic, and political \ntraditions  and  institutions  distinct  from  the  mainstream  or  dominant  society  or  culture.  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous  peoples  policy  uses  the  following  characteristics  to  define  indigenous  peoples:  (i) \ndescent from population groups present in a given area; (ii) maintenance of cultural and social \nidentities separate from dominant society and culture; (iii) self-identification and identification by \nothers  as  being  part  of  distinct  cultural  group;  (iv)  linguistic  identity  different  from  that  of \ndominant  society;  (v)  social,  cultural,  economic  and  political  traditions  and  institutions  distinct \nfrom  dominant  culture;  (vi)  economic  systems  more  oriented  towards  traditional  productions \nsystems  rather  than  mainstream;  and  (vii)  unique  ties  and  attachments  to  traditional  habitats \nand  ancestral  territories.  Essentially,  indigenous  peoples  have  a  social  and  cultural  identity \ndistinct  from  the  main  society,  which  makes  them  vulnerable  to  being  overlooked  in \ndevelopment processes.  \n \nThe  coastal  Vedda\u2019s  communities  retain  a  number  of  social  and  cultural  traditions  and \n3. \ndistinct  economic  activities  such  as  group  hunting,  food  gathering  and  fishing.  As  such,  the \nVeddas are, according to ADB\u2019s policy, considered indigenous peoples.  \n \n \n \n\nIndigenous Groups \n\n\f112 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\nObjective of Indigenous Peoples Development Framework  \n\nC. \n \n4. \nThe  objective  of  IPDF  is  to  ensure  that  indigenous  peoples  living  in  coastal \ncommunities\u2014in  this  case,  the  Veddas\u2014will  have  opportunities  to  participate  in  and  benefit \nequally from either project, thereby enabling them to reconstruct and improve their livelihoods, \ndwellings, and public facilities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nThe objectives of the IPDF are the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nindigenous  peoples \n\nPromote  active  participation  of \nimplementation, and monitoring. \nFormulate specific activities to improve social and economic conditions of these \ngroups, taking into account their own views in the process. \nEnsure  that  project  interventions  are  culturally  sensitive  and  do  not  in  any \nmanner adversely affect their cultural identities and customs. \nPromote \nimplementation.  \n\nin  decision  making  and  project \n\nthe  participation  of  women \n\nin  project  planning, \n\nProcedure for Preparing an IPDP \n\nThe above will provide the basis for the formulation of IPDPs of subprojects, if required.  \n\n \n6. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nAn  IPDP  is  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design  and  includes  provisions  for  project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. An IPDP will consist of (i) preliminary screening, (ii) \nsocial impact assessment, (iii) mitigation measures, (iv) development assistance, and (v) project \nmonitoring. \n \n8. \nPreliminary  Screening.  The  executing  agency  (EA)  and  project  design  and \nimplementation  consultants  will  visit  all  tsunami-affected  coastal  communities,  which  come \nunder  these  two  projects.  During  these  visits,  the  EA  and  project  design  and  implementation \nconsultants  will  arrange  public  meetings  with  village  leaders  of  Vedda  communities  to  collect \ninformation about their views on project activities and how they address their needs.  \n\n9. \nSocial  Impact  Assessment.  The  screening  process  will  identify  indigenous  peoples, \ntheir  groups,  community-based  organizations,  cultural  traditions,  and  community  structures.  If \nrequired,  a  social  impact  assessment  (SIA)  will  be  prepared  to  gather  information  on  the \npopulation and its social, cultural, and economic conditions, and the anticipated social, cultural, \nand economic impacts of the projects, both positive and negative. Focus group meetings will be \nheld with community leaders and groups of men and women who have been severely affected \nand  with  those  who  live  in  the  \u201czones  of  influence\u201d  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  If  the  SIA \nindicates  that  the  subprojects  would  significantly  threaten  cultural  practices  and  sources  of \nlivelihood of indigenous peoples, every attempt will be made to avoid or minimize such adverse \nimpacts in the formulation and implementation of IPDPs. \n \n10.  Mitigation  Measures.  All  affected  Vedda  households  will  be  helped  to  improve  their \nliving standards without exposing their communities to disintegration. As vulnerable groups, they \nare  entitled  to  receive  special  assistance  not  only  to  restore  and  improve  their  income  and \nlivelihood,  but  also  to  maintain  their  distinct  cultural  identity.  If  the  subproject  impacts  are  not \nsignificant and if they could be addressed by resettlement plans that will be prepared according \nto  the  agreed-on  resettlement  framework,  \u201cspecific  actions\u201d  could  be  built  into  resettlement \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n113\n\nConsultation and Information Disclosure \n\nplans  to  safeguard  their  entitlements.  This  decision  will  depend  on  the  severity  of  impacts  on \nthem.  \n \n11. \nDevelopment Assistance. In case a subproject impacts on Veddas, they are entitled to \nall assistance that will be provided to other tsunami-affected communities. They are entitled to \nreceive  support  to  continue  their  distinct  living  arrangements  and  to  maintain  their  unique \ncultural system.  \n \nLand  Acquisition.  In  case  of  land  acquisition,  Veddas  are  entitled  to  receive  land  in \n12. \ncompensation  for  the  acquired  land.  As  indigenous  peoples,  they  will  have  traditional  land \nrights. The absence of land titles will not bar indigenous peoples from receiving compensation. If \nthey prefer cash for land, they are entitled to receive cash compensation for land and housing. \nTheir  compensation  entitlements  will  be  the  same  that  are  listed  in  the  approved  resettlement \nframework in Appendix 12. Land-for-land or cash-for-land compensation will be paid before any \nsubproject activity is started.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nThe tsunami-affected indigenous peoples will be informed and consulted when an IPDP \nis  prepared  to  enable  them  to  benefit  from  the  project  and  to  protect  them  from  any  potential \nadverse impacts of the project. Therefore, consultation with and participation of the communities \nand  their  continuous  interaction  with  local  government  officials  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the \nformulation of an IPDP. The plan will be translated into the local language and made available \nbefore implementation by the EA with the assistance of NGOs. \n \n14. \nLocal  communities  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  will  help  implement \nIPDPs,  and  all  issues  in  dispute  will  be  resolved  through  consultation  and  facilitation.  The  EA \nwill ensure that adequate funds wil be available for consultation and facilitation \n \nF. \n \n15. \nThe  EA  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  of  subprojects  will  be  responsible  for  the \noverall  coordination,  financing,  implementation,  and  monitoring  IPDPs.  The  EA  will  make \narrangements  to  appoint  officials  who  are  sensitive  to  indigenous  peoples  issues  and \nknowledgeable in their ways of life, culture, and practices to plan and implement IPDPs. The EA \nwill  ensure  that  the  consultants  hired  to  plan  and  implement  IPDPs  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous  peoples  policy  and  safeguards.  The  EA  or  IA  will  engage  an  anthropologist  to \nexamine  the  Veddas\u2019  needs  and  to  recommend  how  to  accommodate  such  needs  under  the \nprojects. \n \nG. \n \n16. \nThe  EA  of  a  subproject  will  provide  sufficient  resources  to  formulate  an  IPDP  if  the \nsubproject  will  have  any  impact  on  the  Veddas.  It  will  implement  the  IPDP  through  district, \ndivisional  and  local  agencies  and  with  the  assistance  with  NGOs.  A  detailed  budget  will  be \nprepared by the EA by taking into account all the activities associated with the formulation and \nimplementation of IPDPs. Each IPDP will have its own budget. Such budgets will be an integral \npart of the project cost, and will be made available during implementation. \n \n \n \n\nInstitutional Framework  \n\nBudgetary Provisions  \n\n\f114 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nH. \n \n17. \nA  set  of  monitoring  indicators  will  be  included  in  each  IPDP,  to  be  reviewed  during \nproject implementation. Internal monitoring will be done by the PMU, along with preparation of \nsemiannual progress reports. An external independent monitor will monitor the progress of the \nimplementation  of  IPDPs.  Reporting  and  monitoring  formats  will  be  prepared  for  an  effective \ninternal and external monitoring. These reports will be submitted to Resident Mission for review \nand comments.  \n \n18. \nEach IPDP will be submitted by the EA to the Resident Mission for review and approval \nbefore  any  subproject  activity  is  started.  This  particularly  applies  to  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation payments.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n115\n\n \n\nCONSULTANT OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE \n\nTsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project  \n\n \nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nObjective \n\n \n1. \nThe objective of the Tsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) is to assist the \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  tsunami  affected  areas.

Loss of \nlife,  livelihoods,  incomes,  and  property  have  resulted  in  significant  socioeconomic  and  psychological  stress.  In  the \nconflict-affected areas essential investments have not been made for a long time.  \n \nThe  project  will  provide  shelter  and  reestablish  vital  services  such  as  roads,  fisheries  and  irrigation  infrastructure, \nhealth  and  educational  facilities,  water  supply,  agricultural  support  services  and  institutions  to  revive  economic \nactivities  leading  to  employment,  income  generation,  rehabilitation  of  displaced  persons,  and  restoration  of  social \nstability in these areas.  \n \nImprovement  of  services  and  infrastructure  will  also  encourage  people  to  return  to  their  original  villages  and \nsettlements. With this end in view, the project will also strengthen health and educational facilities while strengthening \nlocal level institutions. Community based organizations will be established and supported, saving will be encouraged, \nwomen will be made more self-reliant, microcredit will be introduced, and recreational facilities will be provided.  \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nTargeting Classification: Poverty Intervention \nIn the North and East, the people affected by the conflict are especially vulnerable due to gender, age, disability, and \ngeneral breakdown in their traditional livelihood systems. Internally displaced people who wish to return to their areas \nof  origin  need  support  in  reestablishing  their  homes  and  their  livelihoods.  Essential  services  such  as  schools, \nhospitals,  clinics,  water  and  power  supply  are  lacking  in  these  areas.  Agricultural  production  has  been  adversely \naffected  by  the  neglect  of  minor  irrigation  schemes.  Surplus  food  production  areas  have  become  food  deficit  areas. \nLivestock numbers have declined. In general the region has suffered extensive dislocation and economic progress has \nbeen  hampered.  These  problems  have  been  further  aggravated  by  the  tsunami  through  loss  of  lives  and  property. \nLivelihoods  especially  of  fishermen  have  been  destroyed. The  psychological  trauma  from  the  loss  of  lives  has  been \ntremendous.  \n \nThe  people  in  the  project  areas  face  major  challenges  in  terms  of  basic  human  needs:  shelter,  employment  and \nlivelihoods,  access  to  services  (education,  health,  agricultural  support  services,  irrigation,  markets,  power  supply), \ncommunity based institutions.  \n \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nMuch  of  the  project  will  be  implemented  through  stakeholder  consultation,  using  a  bottom-up  approach.  Subproject \nformulation, design, and selection will be through community consultation. Local participation in the implementation of \nsubprojects  will  be  encouraged  as  appropriate.  This  process  has  proven  highly  successful  in  other  ongoing \nrehabilitation projects in the North East.  \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n\f128 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The conflict and the tsunami have resulted in a disproportionate increase \nin the number of women-headed households in the North East. To some extent this is also true in the South after the \ntsunami.  This  presents  significant  challenges  in  these  communities  where  women  traditionally  have  many  other \ndisadvantages. Both projects provide opportunities through various components, for both women and men, to restart \nand to initiate livelihood and enterprise activities. The projects will be proactive in identifying the women, households \nheaded  by  women,  war  widows,  etc.  in  the  various  communities  who  require  training  in  production-related  skills, \nbusiness  planning,  marketing  skills  and  access  to  credit  and  technical  support  to  enable  them  to  improve  their \neconomic strength and contribute to the enhanced well-being of their families.

The GAP is based on the analysis1 that that women are \ndisadvantaged and discriminated against in sociocultural, economic, and political spheres of life \nand are denied equal access to resources, services, and opportunities that would enable them \nto  participate  in,  contribute  to,  and  benefit  fully  from  development  processes.  TAARP  and \nNECORD-II will encourage and support women\u2019s increased participation in needs assessment \nand  consultation  and  in  planning  and  implementing  activities  in  different  sectors  through  the \nvarious components of both projects. The GAP will give particular attention to the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nin  urban  planning  and  village \n\nequal  participation  of  women  and  men \nreconstruction and development activities and processes;  \nrecovery of livelihood and economic activities for women and men, while paying \nspecial  attention  to  the  introduction  of  and  support  for  livelihood  and  enterprise \nactivities  for  war  widows  and  female-headed  households  in  the  conflict-affected \nareas;  \nequal  access  of  women  and  men  to  infrastructure  activities  in  relation  to \nplanning, construction, as users and in maintenance; and  \ninvolvement  of  women  and  men  in  environmental  management  and  coastal \nresource management.  \n\n \nThe  GAP  will  be  implemented  through  the  planned  implementation  mechanisms  for \n2. \nTAARP and NECORD-II. The capacity of implementing agencies and units will be strengthened \nthrough  training,  and  consultants  and/or  consulting  agency  services  will  be  obtained,  where \nnecessary, to implement the GAP.  \n \n\nTable A19: Gender Action Plan \n\nSector  \nLivelihood \u2013 \nCoastal \n \n\nActivity and Target \n\u2022  Support formation of community-based organizations (CBOs) for women in \ncoastal communities to reestablish livelihoods\u2014selling fresh fish, making \nand selling dried fish.  \n\nVillage \nDevelopment \n \n\n\u2022  Train women in management of CBOs, leadership, organizing skills.  \n\u2022  Provide women with training and micro credit for economic activities.  \n\u2022  Provide women and men with access to value addition processes, local \n\nand other markets.  \n\n\u2022  Provide women and men with information and access to other types of skill \n\ntraining and livelihood opportunities.  \n\n\u2022  Promote and ensure consultation with both men and women in village \n\nreconstruction and development plans.  \n\n\u2022  Ensure the participation of men and women in establishing CBOs. \n\u2022  Prioritize women\u2019s participation in training on management of CBOs, \n\nleadership and organizing skills and in taking CBO leadership.  \n\n\u2022  Ensure that women are not discriminated against in obtaining titles to \n\nhousing and property.  \n\n\u2022  Provide employment opportunities for women and men in shelter \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.
