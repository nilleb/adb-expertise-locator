The  report  also  describes  (i)  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening \nInstitutional Capacity for Project Development and Urban Governance in Tamil Nadu, and (ii) the \nproposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Asian  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the \nClean Energy  Financing Partnership Facility;1 and if the  Board approves the  proposed MFF, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA and the administration \nof the grant. \n \n2. \nThe program will develop priority water supply, sewerage, and drainage infrastructure in \nat least 10 cities in strategic industrial corridors in Tamil Nadu.2 It will (i) support innovative pilot \nprojects, including India's first solar-powered sewage treatment plant (STP) to offset greenhouse \ngas emissions and enhance operational efficiency; (ii) strengthen urban governance; and (iii) build \ncapacity  of  state  and  local  institutions  to  enhance  urban  service  delivery,  environmental \nsustainability, and climate resilience.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\n \nUrban challenges. Tamil Nadu is the most urbanized of India\u2019s large states\u201448.5% of \n3. \nits population lives in urban areas, a share that is projected to increase to 67.0% in 2030\u2014and \nmakes the second-largest contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Although Tamil \nNadu is a leader in many areas of manufacturing, managing its rapid urbanization is essential to \nsustain economic growth, alleviate poverty, and maintain urban livability. Key challenges include \n(i) acute infrastructure deficits as a result of rapid urbanization; (ii) growth of slum populations; (iii) \npollution  of  waterways;  (iv)  weak  institutional  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  projects;  and  (v) \nmixed  performance  in  key  areas  of  governance,  including  local  revenue  generation,  financial \nmanagement, and municipal administration. Water-related disasters\u2014such as recurring droughts \n(once in every 2.5 years) and catastrophic urban floods linked to climate change\u2014are aggravated \nby the high water losses associated with aging distribution networks, and inadequate drainage \nsystems not adapted to heavier monsoon rains. Addressing these complex challenges requires \nsignificant investments and deeper institutional support. \n \n4. \nLow  levels  of  urban  services.  In  Tamil  Nadu,  urban  service  levels  remain  low.  As  of \n2017: (i) 48% of households are served by piped water; (ii) 80% of cities receive less than 80 \nliters of water per capita per day versus the national standard of 135 liters per capita per day; (iii) \nnonrevenue  water  (NRW)  is  30%\u201350%;  (iv)  42%  of  households  are  covered  by  a  sewerage \nnetwork; (v) wastewater treatment capacity is 43% of sewage generation; and (vi) urban drainage \ncoverage is 50%.4 Low service levels are primarily the result of inadequate local finances to invest \nin  capital  expenditures  and  a  shortage  of  trained  staff.  The  program  will  directly  support \nimprovement in these areas. \n\n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. ADB secured approval of the Asian Clean Energy Fund grant outside the \n\nMFF and will disburse the funding concurrently with Tranche 1. \n\n2  The project will include the following city corporations and municipalities (collectively referred to as cities): Ambur, \nChennai, Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Rajapalayam, Thoothukudi, Tiruppur, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. The \ncities were selected based on population size, location in economic corridors, and eligibility for central government \nfunds (para. 7). Other cities eligible for support under the program are subject to compliance with selection criteria \noutlined in the Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n3  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to India for State-Level Support for National Flagship Urban Programs. Manila. \n4  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2017. State Annual Action Plan, 2017\u20132020. Chennai. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nRoad map. To address the challenges of rapid urbanization, the state aims to (i) provide \n5. \nuniversal  access  to  water  and  sanitation,  (ii)  develop  \u201cworld-class\u201d  cities,  (iii)  establish  high-\nperforming  industrial  corridors,  and  (iv)  promote  climate-resilient  urban  development. 5  Tamil \nNadu\u2019s  strategic  documents  outline  programs  that  support  capacity  building;  enable  access  to \ninfrastructure  development  funds;  and  employ  green  technologies,  such  as  solar  power,  to \nachieve  sector  goals.6 Vision  Tamil  Nadu  2023  estimated  an  urban  investment  requirement  of \n$42.7 billion, including $7.5 billion for water supply and sanitation, prioritizing continuous and full \ncoverage  of  services.  The  State  Annual  Action  Plan,  2017\u20132020  (footnote  4)  identified  136 \nprojects in 27 cities covering water supply, sewerage, and drainage infrastructure. \n \n6. \nPolicy framework. The Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department (MAWS) \n(the state-level agency for urban development in Tamil Nadu) established the Commissionerate \nof Municipal Administration (CMA) to (i) support urban local bodies (ULBs) (municipalities) plan \ninfrastructure to meet national service-level standards; and (ii) advance urban reforms set forth in \nIndia\u2019s Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, focusing on the devolution of service \ndelivery  and  revenue  generation  to  ULBs.  However,  to  improve  the  financial  and  governance \nperformance of ULBs, the state needs to strengthen CMA\u2019s capacity to support ULBs and monitor \nurban reforms, particularly in areas of revenue generation, financial management, operation and \nmaintenance (O&M), and the introduction of innovative approaches in the sector. \n \nNational  urban  flagship  programs.  Tamil  Nadu  will  access  funds  from  three  national \n7. \nurban flagship programs under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs: (i) the Swachh Bharat \nMission for Urban Areas, (ii) the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, and (iii) \nthe Smart Cities Mission. The programs are complementary. However, given the large investment \nrequirements of Tamil Nadu, additional funds are required, and the state requested ADB for TA \nand financial assistance to help achieve its urban sector goals (para. 5). \n \n8. \nStrategic context. The program aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u2013\n2022 for India, particularly the three growth pillars linked to India\u2019s urban transformation;7 and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.8 It supports the development of \nthe Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor and the second phase of the East Coast Economic \nCorridor, India\u2019s first coastal economic corridor implemented by the state in partnership with ADB \nto link Tamil Nadu\u2019s manufacturing sector with global value chains in East and Southeast Asia.9 \nThe project will enhance basic services of major cities within economic corridors to meet worker\u2019s \nquality-of-life  needs,  as well  as provide  industry with  a reliable source  of  treated  and  reusable \nwastewater for production demands. The program supports synergies with proposed ADB energy \nand transport projects in Tamil Nadu for industrial corridor development (footnote 8). \n\n                                                \n5  Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 defines \u201cworld-class\u201d cities as those that are free from garbage and open defecation and \nwhose  infrastructure  is  upgraded  with  continuous  water  supply  access,  and  efficient  mass  transit  and  sanitation \nsystems.

This  includes  (i)  establishing  within  CMA  (a)  a  new  state-level  urban  data  and \ngovernance  improvement  cell,  and  (b)  a  new  project  design  and  management  center;  and  (ii) \nimplementing  (a)  state-wide  performance-based  urban  governance  improvement  program  for \nTamil  Nadu\u2019s  135  cities  to  improve  revenue,  financial  management,  administration,  service \ndelivery, gender mainstreaming, wastewater reuse, and fecal sludge management; and (b) public \nawareness  campaigns  on  water  conservation,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  in  project  cities.  The \nprogram  will  intensify  the  capacity  building  of  key  urban  institutions  and  provide  incentives  for \nurban  governance  improvement.  Project  design  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  PMU  to \nprepare new projects in subsequent tranches that meet ADB requirements. \n \n14. \nfinanced by an MFF.16 \n\nUse  of  multitranche financing facility.

No Category A safeguards \nprojects will be included in the MFF. The state is committed to implementing the \nprogram following its urban sector road map. \nThe executing and implementing agencies have strong track records in managing \nlarge  development  partner-funded  projects  and  safeguards. 17  Tranches  are \nsequenced  based  on  the  readiness  and  absorptive  capacity  of  cities  for  large \ninvestments.18 Tranches  are  mutually  dependent  in  design  (e.g.,  networks  and \ntreatment), governance improvement, and capacity building. \nThe  MFF  will  facilitate  deeper  policy  dialogue  and  capacity  building  in  areas  of \nclimate change resilience, financial sustainability, and urban governance (para. 6), \nwhich are critical areas where ADB can add value, and which require long-term \ncommitments and an extended implementation period. There are no foreseeable \nrisks to the continuity of policy dialogue under the program. \n\nScope of Tranche 1. Tranche 1 is representative of MFF investments and will support \n\n \n15. \nChennai, Coimbatore, Rajapalayam, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. \n \n16. \nOutput 1: Climate-resilient sewage collection and treatment, and drainage systems \ndeveloped in six cities.

The  TA  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  new  project \ndesign  and  management  center  in  CMA  to  support  ULBs  in  preparing  project  proposals  and \napplying innovative approaches in the sector. It will also strengthen the capacity of CMA to apply \nbest  practices  in  urban  governance  improvement  programs.  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. CMA will be \nthe implementing agency for the TA from September 2018 to December 2020. \n \n\nV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nADB conducted technical due diligence of Tranche 1 to ensure subprojects designs are \nrobust,  including  a  comprehensive  review  of  feasibility  studies,  engineering  designs,  cost \nestimates,  and  site  investigations.  ADB  appraised subprojects  based  on  (i)  rationale  and \nrelevance,  benefits,  and  ease  of  implementation  and  operations;  (ii)  technical  alternatives  and \ntheir  viability,  including  STP  technology  and  NRW  management;  (iii)  life  cycle  costs,  including \ncapital and operating costs; and achievable cost savings through energy efficiency, renewable \nenergy, and climate-resilient measures; (iv) maximizing beneficiary area coverage including the \npoor;  (v)  minimizing  adverse  environmental  and  social \nimpacts;  and  (vi)  optimizing \nimplementation timelines through high project readiness. In all subprojects with existing facilities, \nADB assessed the viability of the facilities and, where possible, incorporated them into the new \nsystems through renovation and expansion. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention  is  sound. \n25. \nTranche 1 aims to provide stronger and more sustainable water supply and sewerage services in \nsix project cities. The estimated economic internal rates of return of the seven subprojects under \nTranche  1  are  10.6%\u201315.3%,  while  the  combined  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  about \n12.2%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of about 9.0%, indicating significant \neconomic returns. The sensitivity analysis also revealed the results are satisfactory, except under \na scenario in which all downside risks are combined, i.e., (i) a 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) a 20% \nO&M  cost  overrun,  (iii)  a  20%  decline  in  estimated  benefits,  and  (iv)  a  1-year  delay  in \nimplementation.  Tranche  1  is  likely  to  be  economically  more  viable  because  of  unquantifiable \nbenefits  not  reflected  in  the  analysis,  such  as  environmental  improvements  and  increased \nproperty values. \n \nFinancial analysis. ADB conducted a financial analysis for the subprojects under Tranche \n26. \n1  to  ensure  their  sustainability  and  to  determine  whether  revenues  generated  will  cover  O&M \ncosts.  The  financial  analysis  indicates  all  Tranche  1  subprojects  would  generate  sufficient \nrevenues to cover full O&M costs, provided CMWSSB and the project ULBs implement regular \ntariff  revisions.  The  financial  performance,  at  the  entity  level,  of  CMWSSB  and  project  ULBs \nindicated  they  all  depend  substantially  on  state  grants.  The  financial  projections  for  CMWSSB \nand  project  ULBs  demonstrate  that  the  revenue  account  will  remain  in  surplus  given  (i)  tariff \nrationalization, (ii) improved collection efficiency, and (iii) continued government support. \n \n\n                                                \n30 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n27. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies can undertake the financial management of ADB-financed \nprojects. 31 TNUIFSL  has  extensive  experience  in  handling  large-scale  development  partner-\nsupported  projects  with  substantial  value.  In  addition,  TNUIFSL,  CMWSSB,  and  project  ULBs \nhave an established legal, institutional, and monitoring framework for budgeting, accounting, and \nauditing. The overall risk assessment for the investment program is moderate. The risk mitigation \nmeasures include (i) extending full training and capacity building support to enhance the financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  TNUIFSL,  CMWSSB,  and  project  ULBs;  (ii)  obtaining  the  state\u2019s \ncommitment that it will set up the PMU and PIUs in a timely manner, with qualified staff; and (iii) \neffectively  implementing  the  systematic  plans  by  CMWSSB  and  project  ULBs  to  enhance \nrevenues and reduce costs. \n \n28. \nProcurement.  Procurement  of  civil  works  and  goods  including  consulting  services  will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).32 The procurement \nof consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). A procurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for \nthe project is moderate. TNUIFSL has extensive experience in development partner-supported \nprocurement of large works and will provide advisory support to CMA and ULBs. \n \n29. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  TNUIFSL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM. Based on the risk assessments, some of the \nmitigation  measures  incorporated  in  the  program  design  aim  to  (i)  establish  a  mechanism  for \nregular voluntary disclosure of relevant information; (ii) develop and update a website to enhance \ntransparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iii)  establish  a \ngrievance redress mechanism to ensure effective resolution of any grievances. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nIn Tamil Nadu, nearly 13% of the population lives in urban poverty, and rapid urbanization \nis  accelerating  the  growth  of  urban  slums.  The  program  will  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction in urban areas and to achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6, which supports \naccess  to  clean  water  and  sanitation  for  all.  Pro-poor  designs  include  (i)  providing  water  and \nsanitation services to slums; (ii) conducting awareness campaigns in poor communities in areas \nof water conservation, health, sanitation, and women\u2019s safety; and (iii) providing skills training to \npoor project-affected persons. \n \n31. \nGender. Tranche 1 is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender design features \ninclude (i) increasing women\u2019s access to safe water and sanitation, especially in poor areas; (ii) \npromoting the participation of women from poor urban communities and increasing representation \nof  women  in  decision-making  bodies;  (iii)  gender-related  capacity  building  for  project \nstakeholders;  (iv)  promoting  equitable  access  to  project  employment  opportunities;  and  (v) \nproviding equal opportunity employment across positions in ULBs.

Initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  by  the \n33. \nimplementing agencies for all Tranche 1 subprojects, which showed no significant environmental \nimpacts. The anticipated impacts are temporary and will be avoided or minimized through proven \nmitigation  measures  and  engineering-construction  practices,  as  outlined  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plans.  In  Vellore  and  Tiruchirappalli,  potentially  significant  impacts  from  works \noccurring within the regulated areas of the protected monuments of the Archaeological Society of \nIndia  will  be  avoided  by  (i)  consulting  with  and  obtaining  permission  from  the  Archaeological \nSociety  of  India,  and (ii)  appointing  an  archaeological  expert to  assess  impacts  and supervise \nconstruction. \n \n34. \nimplementing  agencies  prepared \nresettlement plans for all subprojects to assess and adequately address (i) potential temporary \nloss of income for street vendors on proposed pipe alignments; and (ii) permanent impacts in the \nVellore sewerage subproject, including 100% structure loss leading to relocation of 87 vulnerable \naffected persons in 22 households. No private land acquisition is required for Tranche 1. \n \n35. \nat or around subproject sites under Tranche 1. \n \n36. \nThe  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  the  safeguard  documents  adequately  address  the \nassessed impacts. Tranche 1 and the MFF, as per the selection criteria, will not include Category \nA subprojects, and safeguard frameworks will guide subproject preparation.35 The implementing \nagencies  conducted  public  consultations  and  safeguard  documents  are  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nand project websites. A grievance redress mechanism will address issues in a timely and effective \nmanner.  TNUIFSL  has  sufficient  capacity  to  monitor  safeguards  based  on  its  experience  in \nmanaging  development  partner-funded  urban  projects  and  will  submit  semiannual  safeguard \nmonitoring reports to ADB. Consultants will assist the PIUs in monitoring safeguards compliance. \n \nF. \n \n37. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).

Tamil Nadu is also \nimplementing projects to augment water supply in program cities. \nProject ULBs and CMWSSB agreed, through the onlending \nagreements with TNUIFSL, to rationalize water and sewage tariffs, \nincluding specific plans for tariff increases over the project \nimplementation period to achieve sustainability. The Government of \nTamil Nadu will continue gap funding to sustain O&M where shortfalls \nexist. The governance improvement program under output 3 \nincentivizes the collection of sewerage user fees. \nThe performance-based urban governance improvement program \nunder output 3 incentivizes and rewards ULBs willing to improve \ncapacity and governance. \nSewage treatment plant contracts include a 10-year O&M period. \n\nCompeting priorities within ULBs and staff \nturnover hinder participation in capacity \nbuilding. \nWeak ULB capacity for advanced sewage \ntreatment plant technology O&M. \nConstruction delays from heavy monsoons \nthat exceed projections and sudden price \nsurges of materials result in cost overruns \nand delays in work completion. \nCMWSSB = Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, O&M = operation and maintenance, TNUIFSL \n= Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited, ULB = urban local body. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nHigh project readiness and a sufficient implementation period will \nmitigate monsoon-related delays. Sufficient contingency is built into the \nbudget to cover unexpected cost overruns. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n38. \nThe national and state governments and TNUIFSL have assured ADB that implementation \nof the investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n39. \nThe national and state governments and TNUIFSL have given ADB certain undertakings \nfor the MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed \nby the national and state governments and TNUIFSL with respect to individual tranches under \nthe MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n40. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to India for the Tamil Nadu Urban Flagship Investment \nProgram in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000,000, which \ncomprises  the  provision  of  loans  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with \ninterest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  and  is  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n\n3 September 2018\n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpacts the Investment Program is Aligned with \n(i)  Universal access to basic water and sanitation services achieved (Vision Tamil Nadu 2023)a \n(ii)  \u201cWorld-class\u201d cities and industrial corridors across the state developed (Vision Tamil Nadu 2023)a \n(iii)  Water security, reduced vulnerability to climate change in urban areas, and enhanced share of renewable energy \n\nachieved (Tamil Nadu Sustainable Water Security Mission, State Action Plan on Climate Change)b \n\n \n\n12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n\nLivability and \nclimate \nresilience in at \nleast 10 cities \nin priority \nindustrial \ncorridors \nenhancedc \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and Baselines \n\nBy 2027 \n \na.
