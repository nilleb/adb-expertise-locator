The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of loans of up to $195 million, in aggregate, to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Fund1 (LEAP) for the ReNew Clean Energy Project in India. If the \nBoard approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the LEAP loans. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n \n\n2. \nThe  Government  of  India  has  established  ambitious  renewable  energy  targets  in  the \ncountry\u2019s electricity-generation mix: 175 gigawatts of capacity from renewable resources by 2022, \nof  which  about  91%  will  come  from  solar  and  wind.  Since  2007,  ADB  has  supported  several \nnonsovereign  projects  encompassing  multiple  segments  of  the  renewable  energy  value  chain, \nfrom  generation  to  transmission.  One  such  project  in  2014  involved  an  early-stage  equity \ninvestment  into  ReNew,  an  independent  power  producer  and  renewable  energy  developer  in \nIndia, to help the company expand its scale of operations.2 As ReNew executes its growth plan, \nwhich  includes  diversification  of  its  portfolio  across  states,  offtakers,  and  technologies,  it \nrequires  debt  financing  for  several  of  its  solar  and  wind  projects  and  has  requested  ADB  to \ncatalyze funding.   \n \n\nProject Design  \n\n2. \n \n3. \nThe  project  involves  the  construction  of  398  megawatts  (MW)  of  solar  power  and \n311 MW of wind power subprojects across six states. Of this, 255 MW of solar subprojects will \nbe  located  in  Jharkhand  in  eastern  India,  representing  ADB\u2019s  first  nonsovereign  exposure  to \nwhat  is  one  of  India\u2019s  less-developed  states.  ADB  will  provide  a  nonsovereign  loan  from  its \nordinary  capital  resources,  along  with  a  loan  from  the  ADB-administered  LEAP  (together  the \n\u201cfacilities\u201d),  to  seven  SPVs  that  were  established  for  executing  the  subprojects  in  the  states  of \nAndhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana, each having \n(or  required  to  have)  a  25-year  power  purchase  agreement.  The  project  will  be  the  first  ADB \ntransaction to catalyze LEAP funding. The facilities will be structured as separate loans to each of \nthe seven SPVs on a project finance basis (Table 1).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n1 Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2 ADB. 2014.

ReNew  was  established  in  2011  with  a  vision  of  creating  a  best-in-class \n6. \nrenewable  energy  company  for  the  development  of  wind  and  solar  power  projects  in  India. \nSumant Sinha, former chief financial officer of Suzlon, founded the company. Since its inception, \nReNew has commissioned 1,167 MW of operational capacity as of 31 August 2016 (933 MW of \nwind and 234 MW of solar). As of August 2016, it has over 1.5 gigawatts of its renewable pipeline \nunder construction or in early development, i.e., over 600 MW of wind farms and over 900 MW of \nsolar  capacity.

Integrity due diligence (IDD) was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s IDD Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations3 and included analyses of the integrity risks \nposed because ReNew\u2019s shareholding structure involves several intermediate jurisdictions. The \nresults  of  these  analyses  are  set  out  in  the  IDD  disclosure  document.4  None  of  the  countries \ninvolved in ReNew\u2019s shareholding structure is listed by the Financial Action Task Force as being \na  strategically  deficient  jurisdiction.  ADB\u2019s  review  of  (Confidential  information  redacted  under \npara.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy)  does  not  give ADB  cause to  believe that \neither entity or the SPVs have been established, or are being used for cross-border tax evasion, \nmoney laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n\n11. \nImpact.  The  project's  impact  will  be  in  the  form  of  continued  diversification  of  India\u2019s \nenergy mix via the addition of renewable energy capacity, providing the country with  a secure, \n\n                                                \n3 ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n4 (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nreliable,  and  sustainable  source  of  electricity  that  strengthens  energy  security  and  reduces  its \nreliance on fossil fuels. The project also contributes to the acceleration and expansion of private \nsector investments in, and scaling up of, clean energy infrastructure in India.  \n \nOutcome.  The  project's  outcome  will  be  increased  renewable  energy  capacity \n12. \ndeveloped and operated by the private sector. The project will generate 1,400 gigawatt-hours of \nclean energy per annum and contribute to avoiding 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions \nannually from 2018 onward. \n \n13. \nOutputs.  The  project  outputs  are  the  development  and  commissioning  of  398  MW  of \nsolar power and 311 MW of wind power for an aggregate of 709 MW of generating capacity by \n2018, and generation of local employment opportunities in support of the project. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure and environment, two of the five core operational areas of ADB, as reaffirmed by \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.5 The project also supports three of the five key thrusts of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  India:  (i)  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  job \ncreation and access to jobs, and (iii) environmental sustainability.6 \n \n15. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB's Energy Policy,7 which states that support for renewable energy projects \nwill be prioritized and broadened. In September 2015, ADB announced that it would double its \nannual  climate  financings  to  $6  billion  by  2020,  including  $4  billion  annually  for  mitigation.  Of \nthis annual amount, $3 billion would target clean energy projects such as solar (as well as wind, \ntransmission, smart grids, and other technologies).8 \n \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  Extended  annual  reviews  of  renewable  energy \n16. \nprojects in India previously financed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department indicated \nthat successful project implementation depends on the strength of the sponsor and its ability to \nunderstand the regulatory environment, and the terms and conditions governing the financing of \nsuch projects. Other lessons, that are not sector-specific, pertain to issues such as a long-term \nforeign  exchange  hedging  strategy  and  coordination  with  domestic  cofinanciers.  ADB  is \nconfident that ReNew can successfully implement the project given its past track record, while \nthe other lessons will be taken into account in the execution of the project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n5 ADB. 2014.

ReNew\u2019s board is \nrepresented by investors with significant domain expertise in the infrastructure and renewable \nenergy industries. ADB is an equity shareholder and holds a seat on the board. ReNew\u2019s \nmanagement team comprises specialists with significant experience in India\u2019s power sector. \nADB appointed Lahmeyer (India) International Limited as the lender's independent engineer \n(LIE) for the two Telangana solar subprojects, and L&T Sargent & Lundy as LIE for the \nKarnataka wind subproject. Technical due diligence, including estimation of the energy yield, \nwas completed for one solar subproject (ReNew Mega Solar Power Private Limited) and one \nwind subproject (Sipla SPV). LIEs will be appointed to assist with the technical due diligence \nand energy yield assessments of the remaining subprojects as those projects move forward in \ntheir development cycles and prior to disbursement from the facilities. \nImplementation period  The project will be implemented over 1 year\u2014construction will be from January 2017\u2013January \n\n2018. The project will be administered until final repayment of the solar subprojects in 2038. \n\n                                                \n9   Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nAspects \nConstruction arrangements  \n\nArrangements \n\nType of arrangement  \n\n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n\n \n\n \n\nPower generation \nequipment \n\n    Contractors \nOperational arrangements \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \nThese suppliers have performed technical analyses of the proposed sites and will supply \nturbines that are optimized for the wind resources in that location.

These  SPVs  were \nestablished  to  develop  solar  and  wind  subprojects  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat, \nJharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana. ADB\u2019s loans will have a tenor of up to \n18 years for wind subprojects and 21 years for solar subprojects; administered loans from LEAP \nwill have a tenor of up to 17 years for wind subprojects and 20 years for solar subprojects.  \n \nB. \n \nADB adds value by mobilizing a substantial financing package to a leading private sector \n23. \nrenewable energy developer. ADB's assistance, structured as long-tenor loans to seven SPVs \n(as  opposed  to  a  single  subproject),  will  be  supplemented  by  $195  million  mobilized  through \nLEAP.  This  approach  results  in  a  more  efficient  use  of  ADB's  resources  and  further \ndemonstrates  the  viability  and  bankability  of  the  renewable  energy  sector  in  India.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  also  contributes  towards  meeting  the  government\u2019s  target  of  renewable  energy \ncapacity addition. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nC. \n \n24. \nOfftaker. The sole source of revenue for each subproject is the offtake agreement with \nthe  respective  state-level  distribution  company.  Therefore,  the  long-term  viability  of  each \nsubproject  is  linked  to  the  financial  health  of  the  distribution  company.  However,  all  the \ndistribution  companies  in  this  project  (except  for  Madhya  Gujarat  Vij  Company  Limited  in \nGujarat  state)  have  moderate-to-weak  credit  risk  profiles  and  rely  heavily  on  timely  tariff \nsubsidies from their state governments to remain viable. The risk of delayed payments by such \ndistribution  companies  is  high  and  there  are  examples  of  payment  delays  to  several  wind \nenergy projects in certain states. However, no distribution company has defaulted. (Confidential \ninformation  redacted  under  para.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy).  However, \nthese  structural  enhancements  will  only  serve  as  short-term \nliquidity  measures.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  initiatives  may  improve  the  financial  standing  of  the  distribution  companies,  but \nthe impact of these measures remains to be seen. \n  \n25. \nSponsor  and  guarantor  risk.  ReNew  has  satisfactorily  developed  and  operated  wind \nand  solar  power  projects.  Its  strengths  include  management\u2019s  extensive  experience  in \nrenewable  energy  in  India  and  proven  access  to  debt  and  capital  markets.  (Confidential \ninformation redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n \nForeign  exchange.  Subproject  revenues  are  paid  in  Indian  rupees.  ADB  expects  to \n26. \narrange  separate  cross-currency  swaps  for  the  tenor  phases  1 and  2  of  its  loans.  ReNew  will \narrange hedging for the tenor phases 1 and 2 of the LEAP tranche, in line with similar hedging \narrangements  previously  made  for  funding  in  United  States  (US)  dollars  provided  by  other \nbilateral lenders. However, there is no assurance that swap markets can support the envisaged \nhedges  at  the  time  the  funds  are  required.  This  means  that  alternative  Indian  rupee  funding \nmechanisms (e.g., a rollover of shorter swaps) will need to be included in the loan agreements. \nMoreover, in the event of any early repayment of the loans, any costs related to the unwinding \nof the swap will be passed on to the respective SPV. ADB will also have the option to disburse \nin  US  dollars,  but  this  will  only  be  undertaken  if  the  foreign  currency  risk  is  hedged  to  ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction. \n \nEngineering, procurement, and construction. (Confidential information redacted under \n27. \npara.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy).  The  payments  are  linked  to  performance \nmilestones,  with  strong  liquidated  damages  clauses  in  case  of  nonperformance.  (Confidential \ninformation redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). ADB will require \nturnkey as well as in-house EPC arrangements to conform to market practices. \n \n28. \nOperation and maintenance. (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic  Communications  Policy).  The  LIEs  will  evaluate  all  related-party  arrangements  and,  before \ndisbursement, verify whether ReNew\u2014and its contractors\u2014can manage the O&M requirements of \nthe subprojects. Before ReNew commits to a subproject, the LIEs will also confirm the adequacy of \ntransmission  line  arrangements  and  the  ability  of  the  relevant  substations  to  accommodate  the \nsubproject to ensure that evacuation risks (during operations) are adequately mitigated. \n \n29. \nSolar and wind resources. ADB\u2019s appointed LIEs will carry out energy yield estimates for \neach  site.  For  wind  subprojects,  wind  resource  and  energy  yield  assessments  will  also  be \nconducted by ReNew\u2019s in-house team and third-party industry experts based on at least 2 years \nof  uninterrupted  wind  data.  The  sites  for  the  solar  subprojects  are  in  India\u2019s  favorable  solar \nradiation  belt.  Resource  forecasts  used  for  calculating  the  base-case  cash  flows  in  each \nsubproject\u2019s financial model will be based on generation exceeding 90% probability each year. A \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nresource assessment by an LIE was completed for one wind and two solar subprojects; the rest of \nthe assessments will be completed before signing of the respective loan agreements. \n \n30.  \nThe  proposed  loans  to  SPVs  owned  by  ReNew  are  rated  NSO7  for  the  subprojects \nlocated  in  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh;  NSO9  for  the  subprojects  located  in  Andhra  Pradesh \nand Karnataka; and NSO10 for the subprojects located in Telangana and Jharkhand.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n31.  \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts.  The  facilities  will  support  seven  subprojects  as  described  in  para.  3.  The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project were identified, and effective measures to avoid, \nminimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  ReNew\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS).  Initial  environmental  examinations  for \nthe two identified solar subprojects were prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements and reviewed by ADB. Initial environmental examinations for the other subprojects \nwill  be  prepared  by  ReNew  prior  to  disbursement,  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction  and  in  line  with  its \nESMS provisions.  \n \n32.  \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of solar and wind power subprojects are \ngenerally site-specific, reversible, and mostly caused by associated construction activities. These \nimpacts  typically  include  land  and  vegetation  clearing  for  site  preparation  and  construction  of \naccess  and  internal  roads  within  the  solar  and  wind  farms,  transportation  and  delivery  of \nequipment  and  materials,  excavation  and  the  laying  of  foundations,  and  installation  of  wind \nturbines and solar panels. Issues may potentially include occupational and community health and \nsafety,  shadow  flicker,  noise  and  vibration,  soil  erosion,  and  potential  threats  to  bird  and  bat \npopulations. All permanent land acquisition for the subproject SPVs will be through voluntary sale \nat market rates on a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis, compliant with requirements for negotiated \nland  acquisition  laid  down  in  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nnegotiated  settlements  will  be  confirmed  through  an  external  audit  of  the  land  procurement \nprocess.  Impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  not  triggered  since  the  site  selection  process  will \navoid procurement of lands owned, used, occupied, or claimed as ancestral domain by Scheduled \nTribes10 for the project. The ESMS includes screening procedures to assess whether the project \nwill affect the human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples. Subprojects with \npotential impacts on Indigenous Peoples, identified during the screening process, will be excluded \nfrom consideration for ADB financing. \n \nits  ESMS,  compliant  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n33.   ReNew  adopted \nrequirements, on August 2014 to manage the environmental and social risks emanating from the \nconstruction  and  operations  of  its  solar  and  wind  projects.  While  ReNew\u2019s  existing  ESMS  is \ncompliant with ADB requirements, the company has hired a qualified and experienced third-party \nconsulting firm to update and improve it to (i) account for ReNew\u2019s changing business model from \nturnkey development to self-development of subprojects, and (ii) to incorporate its lessons since \n\n                                                \n10 Scheduled tribes, refers to tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities \nas  are  deemed  under  Article  342  of  the  Indian  Constitution  as  Scheduled  Tribes,  based  on  their  primitive  traits, \ndistinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n2014 from implementing the ESMS. ADB will review the updated ESMS for compliance with ADB \nrequirements. The institutional capacity and commitment of ReNew to manage the project\u2019s social \nand  environmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate  and  capable  to  manage  the  envisaged \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts of the project. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11  \n \n34.   ReNew  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.12 ReNew will report regularly to ADB on (i) their (and their contractors\u2019) compliance \nwith such laws and (ii) the measures taken.  \n \nB. \n \n35.   ReNew was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \n37. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the  Charter), \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of  India \nhas  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  seven  SPVs  owned  (or  majority-owned)  by \nReNew.
