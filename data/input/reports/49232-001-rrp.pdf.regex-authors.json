THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei \nAir Quality Improvement\u2013Hebei Policy Reforms Program.1 \n \n2.  The program supports the Hebei provincial government (HPG) in increasing its efforts to \nimprove air quality in the greater capital area, comprising Beijing municipality (Beijing), Tianjin \nmunicipality (Tianjin), and Hebei province (Hebei) (together, the BTH region). The program will \n(i) reduce emissions from major air pollution sources, (ii) strengthen environment policy and the \ninstitutional framework for implementation, and (iii) enhance employment support for inclusive \nindustrial  transformation.  The  program  will  provide  HPG  with  a  solid  basis  to  introduce \nincremental reforms under the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, while enabling HPG to \nconsolidate and accelerate necessary actions during 2015\u20132016. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development constraints. In 2013, the BTH region, with a population of 109.2 million, \ngenerated a gross domestic product (GDP) of CNY6.2 trillion, accounting for 10% of the national \ntotal. While the region is an engine of socioeconomic development for the PRC, poor air quality \njeopardizes its sustainable growth.2 The concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ozone, \nand inhalable particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM ) reached levels \n2.5\nthat  may  cause  significant  public  health  impacts.3 In  2014,  the  annual  average  PM\n2.5 \nconcentration  was  93.0  micrograms/cubic  meter,  several  times  higher  than  in  cities  of \ndeveloped  countries.4 In  the  BTH  region,  PM is  locally  generated  and  formed  in  the \n2.5 \natmosphere  by  emissions  from  (i)  industries,  (ii)  continuous  coal  burning  for  electricity \ngeneration and heating boilers in urban and rural areas, (iii) increasing motor vehicle emissions, \nand  (iv)  the  burning  of  agricultural  biomass  waste.  The  topographical  and  meteorological \ncharacteristics of the region are also conducive to the buildup of air pollution. While air pollution \nhas been a common environmental problem for many developed countries as their economies \ndeveloped over spans of 40\u201350 years, the situation for the BTH region is unique. As part of a \nfast-developing upper middle-income country, the region is undergoing unprecedented rates of \ngrowth that make the area simultaneously experience various types of air pollution resulting \nfrom industrialization, urbanization, and motorization.5  \n                                                \n1  The concept paper was circulated to the Board of Directors on 4 September 2015. ADB. 2015. Proposed Policy-\nBased Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China: Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air Quality Improvement Program. Manila. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. 2014. Better Growth Better Climate. Washington, DC. In 2010, \noutdoor air pollution in the PRC was estimated to cause 1.3 million premature deaths per year, and economic \nlosses of 9.7%\u201313.2% of national GDP. \n3  Among the pollutants, PM  has the most severe impact on public health. The World Health Organization \n2.5\nconcludes that no amount of PM  is safe. An epidemiological study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in \n2.5\nBeijing showed the correlation between levels of ambient particulate matter and mortality from cardiovascular and \nrespiratory diseases. The results confirm research findings from the United States and Europe. \n4  The new air quality standard for PM in the PRC (GB 3095-2012) is still 35 micrograms/cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), \n2.5 \ncompared with 15 \u00b5g/m3 for the United States and Japan, and 10 \u00b5g/m3 for the World Health Organization. \n5  Ambient air pollution follows the typical pattern of socioeconomic development, from industrialization-related \nprimary pollutants (e.g., sulfur oxides and particulate matter) to urbanization- and motorization-related secondary \npollutants (e.g., nitrogen oxides and photochemical oxidants). In the BTH region, air emissions from all sources \ncoexist and escalate public health impacts. \n ", "2 \n4.  An imbalanced socioeconomic structure in the BTH region has made Hebei the main \nsource of air pollution and a clear bottleneck for air pollution control. Despite the geographic \nadvantage  of  encompassing  Beijing  and  Tianjin,  Hebei\u2019s  vast  peri-urban  and  rural  area \nsubstantially lags in socioeconomic development. In 2014, Hebei\u2019s GDP per capita was $6,509, \nmore than 14% below the national average of $7,592, and only 40% of Beijing\u2019s GDP and 38% \nof Tianjin\u2019s GDP. About 88% of the 3.1 million poor in the region live in Hebei. While Hebei\u2019s \nabundant land resources and inexpensive laborers firmly support the overall development of the \nBTH  region,  Hebei\u2019s  economy  relies  heavily  on  polluting  secondary  industries\u2014coal-fired \nenergy generation, iron, steel, coking, and cement. Their contribution to the provincial GDP \nincreased from 50.3% in 2000 to 52.2% in 2013. During the same period, Beijing and Tianjin \ngradually transformed their industrial structure to tertiary service industries. In 2014, 7 of the 10 \ncities with the worst air quality in the PRC were in Hebei. Hebei emits more than 80% of total \nprimary PM  in the BTH region, and three times more nitrogen oxides\u2014one of the precursors \n2.5\nof secondary PM \u2014than the total of Beijing and Tianjin. To improve the region\u2019s air quality, the \n2.5\nfirst  priority  is  to  address  Hebei\u2019s  problems,  while  improving  coordination  of  air  quality \nimprovement efforts in the region. \n \n5.  Government efforts and challenges. As a national priority, the central government is \nscaling up its efforts to address this environmental challenge together with climate change.6 The \nnational  air  quality  standards  were  updated  in  2012  to  be  equivalent  with  those  in  most \ndeveloped countries. The new environmental protection law came into force in 2015. In 2013, \nthe State Council issued the Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, 2013\u2013\n2017.7 In 2013\u20132014, the central government budgeted CNY15 billion to improve the air quality \nin six northeastern provinces, including the BTH region. The governments of Beijing, Tianjin, \nand Hebei formulated their own plans for air pollution prevention and control for 2013\u20132017. In \nthe five-year Hebei Clean Air Action Plan (HCAAP), HPG commits to reduce by 2017 (i) PM\n2.5 \nconcentration by 25% from the 2012 level, (ii) steel-making production capacity by 60 million \ntons, (iii) cement production capacity by 60 million tons, (iv) coal consumption by 40 million tons, \nand (v) glass production capacity by 38 million weight boxes.8 By the end of 2014, Hebei had \nreduced steel-making capacity by 15 million tons, cement production by 39.2 million tons, and \ncoal consumption by 15 million tons. \n \n6.  The introduction of the HCAAP and urgent air pollution mitigation requirements led to \nHebei\u2019s  fragmented  policy  framework.  Pollution  reduction  efforts  during  2013\u20132014  only \nresulted  in  several  short-term  \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d  policy  actions  and  the  strengthening  of  legal \nenforcement against polluting industries to reduce production capacity and the number of old \nvehicles.9 In 2014, Hebei was the PRC\u2019s second-largest coal consumer with 90% of energy \n                                                \n6  The PRC government recognizes that actions for air pollution control will reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). The \nSeptember 2015 joint presidential statement of the United States and the PRC on climate change, and the PRC \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change indicate the PRC's commitment to lower its 2015 carbon dioxide emissions per unit \nof GDP by 60%\u201365% by 2030. This will be achieved through various measures, including power generation with \nhigher efficiency and lower GHG emissions, low-carbon city development, promotion of public transportation, and \nfuel-efficiency standards on heavy-duty vehicles. \n7  Government of the PRC. 2013. Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, 2013\u20132017. Beijing. \n8  The action plan identifies more than 50 measures. The direct measures for air pollution control include (i) industrial \npollution control; (ii) point and area source emission control; (iii) vehicle and mobile source pollution prevention and \ncontrol; (iv) fuel switch and upgrade and/or phase out of coal-fired boilers; (v) adjustment of energy structure and \npromotion of clean energy; and (iv) air quality and pollution monitoring, capacity building, and training. The indirect \nmeasures include (i) optimizing industrial layout, and (ii) supporting technology transformation and innovation. \n9  \u201cEnd-of-pipe\u201d policy actions address the end of the process stream, such as the installation of pollution control \ndevices. They can be effective for quick outcomes but do not address the fundamental issues. \n ", "3 \n \nsupplied by coal, much higher than the national average of about 70%. During 2013\u20132014, \ntransport policies did not target the key issue of the increasing number of motor vehicles. Both \nurban and rural areas depend on old and inefficient infrastructure for cooking and heating. The \nexisting policies offered few alternatives to the seasonal burning of agricultural biomass waste. \nTo remove constraints and enhance long-term development prospects, Hebei needs (i) a basic \nand  comprehensive  policy  framework,  (ii)  well-coordinated  actions  to  gradually  enhance \npolicies, (iii) investments to better manage air pollution reduction efforts, and (iv) private sector \nparticipation in financing necessary investments for industrial modernization.  \n \n7.  A weak environmental institutional framework for policy enforcement and an incomplete \nset of regulations constrain comprehensive control of air pollution in Hebei. Unlike in Beijing and \nTianjin, Hebei does not regulate volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a key pollutant for PM  \n2.5\nand ozone. The vast coverage area and lack of systematic information collection and analytical \ncapacity make the formulation of policies and actions that effectively target key pollution sources \ndifficult. Hebei has issued a series of policies and environmental standards to control industrial \nair pollution, but inadequate institutional capacity to enforce regulatory compliance is a barrier to \na fair and transparent approach to control air pollution. \n \n8.  While reducing the capacity of polluting industries is an effective measure to mitigate air \npollution, policy reform must be considered in the context of medium- to long-term industrial \ntransformation and inclusive socioeconomic development. Industries in Hebei provide a number \nof job opportunities to local skilled and unskilled laborers. Air pollution control measures need to \nconsider  social  aspects  as  its  integral  part  because  industrial  transformation  may  not  be \nsuccessful  without  an  adequate  and  inclusive  social  protection  system  and  employment \nopportunities to support affected laborers during the socioeconomic transition. \n \n9.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s policy dialogue. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen a main development partner of Hebei since 1998.10 Through technical assistance in 2002\u2013\n2005, ADB supported the development of Hebei\u2019s provincial development strategy to accelerate \nits  economic  integration  with  Beijing  and  Tianjin.  The  strategy  emphasizes  the  need  for \nstructural reforms to promote (i) ecological and environmental sustainability of BTH regional \ndevelopment, (ii) greater economic cooperation with Beijing and Tianjin, (iii) pro-poor economic \ndevelopment, and (iv) an enabling investment environment for the private sector. Two ongoing \nloan projects\u2014Hebei Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector Project, and \nHebei Energy Efficiency Improvement and Emission Reduction Project\u2014are financing needed \ninfrastructure, and contributing to air quality improvement by reducing coal usage by inefficient \nheating boilers in cities and improving energy efficiency in key industries. \n  \n10.  In 2014, poor air quality in the BTH region indicated that the 2013\u20132014 pollution control \nmeasures  were  insufficient.  Since  mid-2014,  policy  dialogue  has  intensified  and  identified \nmissing links to build a comprehensive policy framework to promote coordinated actions and \ninvestments for air pollution reduction. Importantly, it emphasized the need to address not only \nshort-term air pollution control, but develop a solid basis to continue with incremental policy \nreforms  under  the  PRC\u2019s  13th  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  and  support  socioeconomic \ndevelopment over the medium- to long-term. This will enable Hebei to move from being a \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2002.

ADB collaborates with other international \ndevelopment partners to leverage the impact of policy advisory and financial support. German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW became a cofinancier of the program. The World Bank \nproposes to support HCAAP implementation through a $500 million program-for-results lending \nmodality in parallel with the ADB program.12 In addition to past technical assistance and ongoing \nloan  projects,  Hebei  requires  a  comprehensive  assistance  package  during  the  remaining \nHCAAP implementation period of 2015\u20132017 with increased financing. This will enable HPG to \n(i) strengthen the framework for incremental policy and investment actions to meet short-, \nmedium-, and long-term development objectives; and (ii) scale up air pollution control in 2015\u2013\n2017. This is systematically addressed by closely coordinated ADB\u2013KfW\u2013World Bank financial \nassistance: a PBL loan provided by ADB\u2013KfW in 2015\u20132016 and a program-for-results loan \nprovided by the World Bank in 2016\u20132017. ADB will be responsible for up-front policy reforms \nby building on its comparable advantage as the only international financial partner that has \nworked on Hebei\u2019s provincial development strategy. The single-tranche PBL will immediately \nand effectively respond to Hebei\u2019s urgent policy reform and financial needs in 2015\u20132016, while \nthe World Bank loan will support HPG\u2019s achievements of key results in 2016\u20132017. The ADB \nand the World Bank programs are designed to fully complement each other.13 \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition includes (i) providing technical advice on \npolicy  actions  to  bridge  policy  gaps,  achieve  higher  targets,  and  accelerate  reforms;  \n(ii) developing stronger institutional coordination in HPG through a socially inclusive industrial \ntransformation process as a part of important air pollution control efforts; (iii) gaining co-benefits \nfrom air pollution reduction and climate change mitigation; and (iv) coordinating multi- and \nbilateral development partners to scale up effectiveness of policy advice on air pollution control. \n \n13.  Alignment with ADB strategy. The program supports the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015 on environmental improvement; this is expected to continue during the 13th Five-\nYear  Plan.14 The  program  is  (i)  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  current  and  draft  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC; (ii) ADB\u2019s paper on a new partnership with upper middle-\nincome countries; and (iii) ADB\u2019s operational directions for investing in environmental goods and \nservices for future economic growth.15  \n \n                                                \n11 In parallel with an overall shift from secondary to tertiary industry, HPG aims to develop a less-polluting secondary \nindustry  including  new  energy  industry  (e.g.,  photovoltaic  power  generation),  electric  vehicle,  information \ntechnology, and environmental equipment manufacturing.  \n12 The World Bank\u2019s program-for-results lending is similar to ADB\u2019s results-based lending, providing financial support \nbased on the achievement of pre-agreed results or key development indicators. \n13 The World Bank\u2019s program design includes indicators on (i) pollution control technologies in selected industries,  \n(ii) the phaseout of old polluting vehicles, (iii) deployment of an energy-efficient clean biomass stove in rural areas, \nand (iv) enhancement of the air pollution monitoring network and its analytical protocol. The end-of-pipe measures \nto cut industrial air pollution are better supported by the program-for-results loan, while the program enables \nappropriate means to achieve such results through issuing new policies and action plans, and exploring better \nincentive schemes to accelerate the reform agenda. \n14 In 2014, ADB provided the National Development and Reform Commission with a set of recommendations on eight \nkey development challenges to be addressed under the 13th Five-Year Plan. \n15 ADB. 2012.

Lessons from sector experience in the PRC include (i) the need for continuous \npolicy dialogue for medium- and long-term development objectives, and (ii) consideration of \nappropriate incentives and measures to ensure financial viability and consumer affordability. \nPBLs in other developing member countries provide valuable lessons, including (i) ensuring \nimpacts  of  policy  reforms  by  identifying  performance-based  measures,  (ii)  identifying \nappropriate interventions to operationalize policy reforms in the field, and (iii) focusing on policy \nactions  on  which  ADB  has  strong  sector  expertise  and  experience.  These  lessons  were \nincorporated to the program design. Performance indicators to measure effectiveness of the \npolicy reform are included in the policy matrix. Proposed technical assistance projects will be \nintegrated to support implementation of the agreed policy actions, and monitor and evaluate the \nperformance, while strengthening air pollution control coordination in the BTH region.16 \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome  \n15.  The impacts will be reduced air pollution and improved public health in the BTH region. \nThe outcome will be a strengthened framework for incremental policy and investment actions in \nHebei to improve air quality in the BTH region. The 17 policy actions were agreed and will be \ncompleted by March 2016. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Policies and actions to reduce air pollution from key sectors issued and \napproved. Policy actions will guide future investments to transform Hebei\u2019s economic structure \nto  be  more  environment-friendly.  Policies  will  include  (i) adjusting  the  energy  structure  by \nreducing coal consumption and promoting clean energy, (ii) promoting public transport in urban \nareas, and (iii) reducing seasonal biomass burning and promoting clean energy in rural areas.  \n \n17.  The policy reform to switch from coal to cleaner energy adopts an integrated approach to \naddress aspects of supply and demand. For the supply side, policy dialogue identified the \nimportance of early deployment of natural gas as a key to trigger fuel switch. The natural gas \ndevelopment plan will be issued with appropriate financial support to accelerate deployment of \ncleaner energy in Hebei. Another policy will increase the amount of recovery, quality standard, \nand financial viability of synthetic gas recycled from coke oven flue gas to be used for heating \ngeneration  and  a  cleaner  energy  source\u2014important  as  Hebei  is  the  second  largest  coke \nproducer in the PRC. For the demand side, HPG will improve the monitoring and supervision of \nmunicipal coal reduction by imposing annual quantitative targets for all municipal governments \nduring 2015\u20132017. Key emission sources of coal-based boilers and their heating service (main \nsource of pollution in winter) will be addressed by phasing out and replacing small, obsolete, \nand  energy-inefficient  coal-fired  boilers  with  centralized  heating  systems  and  boilers  using \ncleaner energy. The policy  will be accompanied  by a comprehensive study of appropriate \nfinancial and market-based mechanisms to support the deployment. This will ensure that Hebei \nresidents, including the poor, can enjoy affordable and cleaner heating service during the winter. \n \n18.  Promotion of public transport in urban areas is an important medium- to long-term \nobjective to develop an environment-friendly city and to improve quality of life. Although less \npronounced, emissions from mobile sources are becoming more evident in Hebei, following the \nsame paths of Beijing and Tianjin. The 2013\u20132014 provincial program successfully phased out \nold vehicles that do not meet the emission standard. However, policy reform is needed to trigger \n                                                \n16 The proposed technical assistance projects are the Study on the Coordinated Development of Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nHebei and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Regional Air Pollution Control. \n ", "6 \na fundamental shift from private to public transport in cities. Reduced motor vehicle emissions \nwill significantly reduce black carbon, one component of PM and an agent that significantly \n2.5 \ncontributes to climate change. The new policy will apply a uniform standard to assess, evaluate, \nand compare the status of public transport in cities, thereby raising the awareness of decision \nmakers on the importance of urban public transport in their cities. \n \n19.  Policy reform is also needed to reduce seasonal biomass burning and promote clean \nenergy in rural areas. In Hebei, 86.5% of biomass stalk is collected, but only 10.0% of that is \nused to recover energy. Policy dialogue confirms that after optimizing the use of biomass \nresources, a higher energy recovery target is feasible, and should be supported by an effective \nincentive scheme, especially to make the biomass briquette a preferable choice of energy \nsource in rural areas. The agreed policy actions represent an integrated approach to (i) ban \nbiomass burning for air pollution reduction, (ii) promote the beneficial use of biomass resources \nto replace coal, (iii) commit to a higher energy recovery target and set clear objectives, and (iv) \nprovide appropriate financial support for policy implementation. \n \n20.  Output 2: Environmental policy and institutional framework for implementation \nstrengthened. Policy actions will assist Hebei in (i) enhancing the legal and policy framework, \n(ii)  developing  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  analytical  system,  and  (iii)  strengthening \nregulatory enforcement capacity in the field of environment. The HCAAP specifies measures to \ncomply with national targets. More than 50 policy documents have resulted from action plans to \nupgrade Hebei\u2019s regulatory framework to reduce air pollution. Despite the effort to align Hebei\u2019s \nstandards with those enacted in Beijing and Tianjin, gaps remain concerning complex sources \nof air pollution, such as VOCs from industrial and domestic point sources, and high diesel \nvehicle emissions from mobile sources. The first VOC emission standard, with limits comparable \nto  those  in  Beijing  and  Tianjin,  will  be  issued  for  key  industry  sectors.  A  study  will  be \ncommissioned on diesel vehicle emission control, one of the untouched but key mobile emission \nsources  of  particulate  matter.  Regulations  on  air  pollution  prevention  and  control  will  be \nimproved, focusing on (i) plans and targets for VOC emission control, (ii) regional mechanisms \nfor unified prevention and control in the BTH region, and (iii) legal responsibilities of county and \nmore senior government departments and bureaus for air pollution prevention and control. \n \n21.  HPG established the Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center and the Environmental \nEmergency and Early Warning Center to monitor and analyze ambient air quality and prevent, \nforecast, and respond to heavy pollution episodes. However, the monitoring is still not adequate \nto properly understand and analyze local and regional pollution dispersion patterns. The system \ncoverage and capacity must be enhanced for almost all aspects of monitoring, modeling, and \nforecasting technologies and their operation. HPG has committed to upgrade its air quality audit, \nincluding  the  monitoring  of  ammonia,  VOCs,  heavy  metals,  and  elemental  and/or  organic \ncarbon. The industry regulatory compliance monitoring system needs to be strengthened by \ninstalling continuous emission monitoring devices in an additional 1,000 key polluting sources. \n \n22.  Despite government efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Environmental Protection \nDepartment (EPD), its regulatory enforcement must be improved. The dialogue identified an \neffective approach to address the challenge. The government will issue a policy to (i) raise \nawareness  and  strengthen  environmental  accountability  among  key  government  decision \nmakers  in  Hebei;  and  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  local  EPDs,  the  Provincial  Environmental \nMonitoring Center, and the Environmental Emergency and Early Warning Center on the use of \nmonitoring equipment and interpretation of data for improved analytical work and regulatory \nenforcement for counties and townships. \n \n ", "7 \n \n23.  Output 3: Employment promotion for inclusive industrial transformation enhanced. \nThe policy action will ensure that workers will be supported during the industrial transformation \nprocess. HPG has issued policies to strengthen the social security programs and the financial \nbasis  of  these  policies,  including  enhanced  unemployment  insurance  and  support  for \nenterprises  to  retain  their  employees.  During  PBL  processing,  dialogue  confirmed  the \nimportance of training, particularly the provision and quality of training that provides employment \noptions to worker. The scope of such policy reform must be holistic and align with the objectives \nof industrial transformation. The training must be responsive to the needs of the current and \nfuture labor market, and to the demands of emerging industries. The quality of trainers is critical \nfor effective training. A newly issued policy in 2015 (i) improves the quality of training institutions, \ntrainers,  and  training  programs  for  workers  to  be  redeployed  and  reemployed;  and  (ii) \nstrengthens the foundation of human resource development in Hebei. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n24.  Hebei is having difficulty mobilizing the financing to implement the HCAAP. The budget \nfor its implementation is estimated at CNY176.3 billion, of which CNY79.4 billion ($12.4 billion) \nis for direct measures to control air pollution during 2013\u20132017. The required funds equal 78% \nof Hebei\u2019s annual fiscal revenue and are nine times more than Hebei\u2019s regular fiscal expenditure \non  environmental  protection  in  2014.  In  2013\u20132014,  a total  of  CNY19.1  billion  was  made \navailable, but the central, provincial, and municipal governments are required to scale up their \nfinancial contributions. Out of the $12.4 billion, $4.8 billion is expected to be spent during 2015\u2013\n2016  (Table  1).  The  actual  financial  inputs  by  the  governments  during  2013\u20132014  and \nestimated  fund  allocations  during  2015\u20132017  will  amount  to  about  $9.2  billion,  leaving  a \nfinancing gap of about $3.2 billion. The ADB, KfW, and World Bank financial assistance will \nincrease the total available resources to $10.2 billion, covering more than 80% of the $12.4 \nbillion, with an additional $2.2 billion to be mobilized for 2017 expenditure. The estimated cost of \nthe agreed policy actions is $1.1 billion during 2015\u20132016, approximately 2.4 times more than \nthe ADB\u2013KfW PBL loan proceeds. A larger investment is expected in 2017, the final year of \nHCAAP.17 \n \nTable 1: HCAAP Program Expenditure (2013\u20132017) \n2013\u20132017   2015\u20132016 \nEstimated  Estimated \nHCAAP Cost   Expenditure \nExpenditure Categories for Direct Air Pollution Control  ($ million)  ($ million) \nIndustrial pollution control  1,388.9   434.5  \nUrban dust and agriculture point and area source pollution control  4,676.1   1,841.9  \nVehicle and mobile source pollution prevention and control  2,221.9   845.0  \nUpgrade or phase out of coal-fired boilers and switch to cleaner energy sources  879.5   305.1  \nFuel switch from coal to natural gas and other cleaner energy sources  2,933.0   1,290.4  \nAir quality and pollution monitoring, capacity building, and training  330.8   81.3  \n  Total  12,430.2   4,798.2  \nHCAAP = Hebei Clean Air Action Plan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n25.  The Government of the PRC has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources and a promotional loan of \u20ac150 million equivalent in US dollar from KfW. The \nADB loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; annuity repayment \nmethod based on a 15% discount factor; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and a commitment charge of \n                                                \n17  Justification of Policy-Based Loan Amount (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n0.15% per year.

Implementation Arrangements \n26.  HPG  is  the  executing  agency  of  the  program.  A  leading  group  chaired  by  a  vice-\ngovernor of HPG will be established to provide overall guidance for program implementation. \nThe group will include senior representatives from the Provincial Development and Reform \nCommission,  Finance  Department,  Agriculture  Department,  EPD,  Transport  Department, \nEnergy  Administration  and  Human  Resources,  and  Social  Security  Department.  The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.18 The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \ndisbursed by a single-tranche before April 2016, upon satisfactory completion of the policy \nactions. HPG monitors and audits annual expenditures for the HCAAP. HPG will be in a position \nto establish that expenditures for the HCAAP relating to agreed policy actions will be larger than \nthe  loan  amount  provided  by  ADB  and  KfW. ADB  will  retain  the rights  to  examine  these \nexpenditures. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  Effectiveness and attribution of policy reforms will be monitored through the performance \nindicators in the policy matrix. The agreed policy actions would contribute to reducing Hebei\u2019s \nannual coal consumption by approximately 12.4 million tons of standard coal, representing 4% \nof Hebei\u2019s total consumption of 287 million tons in 2012.19 Estimated annual reductions of air \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions against 2012 baselines will be 18 million tons of carbon \ndioxide, 170,000 tons of primary PM  (19% reduction), 546,000 tons of sulfur dioxide (33%), \n2.5\n289,000 tons of nitrogen oxide (14%), and 71,000 tons of VOCs (5%).20 Policy actions focusing \n                                                \n18 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n19 The figures for reductions in standard coal consumption and air emissions are based on the best available \ninformation with assumptions. The unit for standard coal\u2014ton coal equivalent\u2014represents the energy generated \nby burning 1 ton of standard coal, i.e., 29.4 gigajoules or 8.1 megawatt-hours. \n20 A measure of Hebei\u2019s GHG emission in 2012 is not available. The reduction of annual coal consumption is equal to \n2% of total coal production in the United States in 2012; the PM emission reduction is twice the total emission of \n2.5 \nthe United Kingdom; the carbon dioxide emission reduction is equal to Mongolia\u2019s national emission. \n ", "9 \n \non  upgrading  air  quality  monitoring  systems  may  further  reduce  emissions  by  improving \nregulatory enforcement and environmental supervision, but their actual contribution is difficult to \nquantify and thus not included in the estimates. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Air pollution is the largest contributor to the burden of disease from the environment. The \nprogram  will  significantly  cut  pollution  emissions  in  the  BTH  region.  Its  economic  benefits \ninclude  (i)  reduced  public  health-related  costs  due  to  avoided  mortality  and  morbidity,  \n(ii) improved economic activities due to increased labor productivity, (iii) avoided ecosystem and \nbiodiversity losses, and (iv) reduced maintenance cost of buildings and other infrastructure. The \nestimation  of  economic  benefits  from  the  program  is  difficult  due  to  several  complex \nassumptions involved with the analysis, including (i) emission reductions due to the program \nand translation of the reduced pollutions to outdoor air quality in Hebei and the BTH region, and  \n(ii) identification of the number and geographical distribution of affected people and extent of \ntheir exposure to the improved air quality. However, the economic benefit of the program is \njustified  by  the  evidence  that  in  2010  PRC  outdoor  air  pollution  was  estimated  to  cause  \n1.3 million premature deaths and economic losses of 9.7%\u201313.2% of national GDP.21 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  The country assessment concludes that the PRC has strong financial management \nlegislation, structures, and systems in place, which have been reinforced in recent years and \naligned with international standards. For Hebei, the assessment demonstrates that the Finance \nDepartment  has  good  capacity  based  on  the  well-established  and  operating  financial \nmanagement system.22 Risks of public financial management in the PRC and the program \nremain moderate as subprovincial performance lags the implementation of reforms in some core \nfunctional  areas  of  accounting,  reporting,  internal  audit,  and  internal  control.  The  country \nassessment concludes that regulatory frameworks have been significantly enhanced in the \nareas of procurement and anticorruption in the PRC. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and HPG. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Better air quality will benefit the whole population of the BTH region, particularly children \nand the elderly, who are the most vulnerable to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.23 \nUnder the program, the phaseout of small coal-fired boilers in urban and rural areas may \nnegatively affect the facilities\u2019 current employees. The agreed policy reform under the social \nsector will provide improved employment support and social protection for these workers, as \nwell as those who may be affected by activities not related to the program during HCAAP \nimplementation (e.g., industrial production capacity adjustment). In the long-term, the agreed \npolicy  reforms  are  expected to  bring  several potential  indirect  benefits,  including (i)  better \n                                                \n21 In 2010, the PRC\u2019s GDP was CNY40.2 trillion ($6.1 trillion). The estimated cost of the PRC\u2019s outdoor air pollution \nincrease is due to accumulated evidence and improved analytical techniques: $76 billion in 2003 (3.8% of GDP, \ncurrent price) by the World Bank; $145 billion in 2005 (5.9% of GDP) by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; \nand $635 billion in 2010 (9.7%\u201313.2% of GDP) by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.

The policy reform \nincludes  designing  an  appropriate  and  affordable  heating  tariff  structure  for  clean  energy \nheating service for poor households. The policy reform for appropriate incentive mechanisms to \npromote  clean  energy  utilization  in  rural  areas  will  also  ensure  it  is  affordable  for  rural \nhouseholds, as this is a key aspect in promoting cleaner energy in rural areas. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Due diligence during preparation concluded that the program's policy actions do not \nentail any involuntary resettlement or have any adverse impact on indigenous peoples or the \nenvironment.24 The program is categorized C for involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, \nand environment. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management  plan.25 The  program  is  categorized  as  medium  risk mainly  due to  weak \nsubprovincial performance of the public financial management and slow fund disbursement. The \nmitigation measures were agreed to closely monitor fund allocation and outputs of clean air \nactions. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix. The government will ensure that \nactual expenditures to the areas related to the policy matrix will exceed the resources provided \nby ADB and KfW. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.
