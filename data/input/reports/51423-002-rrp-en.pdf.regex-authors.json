THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nMongolia for the Vegetable Production and Irrigated Agriculture Project. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) for the Supporting Irrigation Scheme in Central Mongolia Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  the modernization  of  government-owned  irrigation  networks \nserving about 7,000 hectares (ha) of land. The project will promote income and employment \ngeneration in rural areas where poverty is endemic. This will be achieved by diversification from \ntraditional low-value grain crops into high-value vegetables. It will also build farmers\u2019 capacity for \nclimate-smart production and better water and irrigation management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s economy has been characterized by rapid growth and transformation since \ntransitioning from central planning in the early 1990s. Mineral exports were the main driver for \nachieving middle-income status in 2011. However, Mongolia\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks \nunderscored the need for a more diversified and labor-intensive economic structure for the rural \npopulation. In 2018, agriculture\u2019s share in employment was 26.7% while it contributed only 10.8% \nof Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product.1 In line with the government\u2019s focus to accelerate economic \ndiversification and job creation, agriculture has become a priority for growth.2 It is the main source \nof livelihood in rural areas, where more than one-third of the total population lives.3 Poverty in rural \nareas (30.8% in 2018) remains higher than in urban areas (27.2% in 2018).4 Limited income-\ngeneration opportunities and lack of resilience to natural disasters increase the risk of rural\u2013urban \nmigration. Agriculture is not sufficiently diversified and relies heavily on imports for vegetables and \nfodder, which in turn threatens national food security and the disaster risk resilience of the livestock \nindustry. Only about half of the country\u2019s vegetable demand was met by domestic production in \n2008\u20122016. Vegetables are in high demand by more health-conscious citizens, and a more \nbalanced diet can be expected to have considerable public health benefits. \n \n4.  Inefficient and climate-vulnerable irrigation services. More frequent droughts induced \nby climate change are a threat to food security, and particularly to vegetable production, which \nrequires reliable access to irrigation services.5 In 2017, only 1% of Mongolia\u2019s land area (777,000 ha) \nwas cultivated, of which only 1.1% (8,900 ha) was used for vegetables (mainly beets, cabbages, \ncarrots, cucumbers, garlic, onions, tomatoes, and turnips). The country\u2019s irrigation systems are \nrecognized as having low water productivity and lacking resilience to severe droughts and floods, \nalthough sufficient water resources are available\u2014only 1.6% of the internal renewable water \nresources were withdrawn in 2014.6 The climate is trending toward a higher annual average \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Existing irrigation \ninfrastructure, and fodder and vegetable yields are threatened by water shortages in early spring, \nsnowmelt river floods throughout spring, and flash floods from storms. \n \n5.  Environmentally unsustainable production systems. After the collapse of the former \nSoviet Union, the cropped area declined from its peak of 837,868 ha in 1989 to 162,040 ha in \n2006, as government support through national and regional crop research and extension centers \ndeclined. The cultivation techniques are unsustainable in terms of water productivity and the use \nof agrochemical inputs with unknown levels of residue in marketed crops. The productivity of \nvegetable-growing systems is further limited by a lack of access to seeds of high-yielding, climate-\nresilient varieties. The absence of reliable quality assurance testing of inputs such as pesticides \nincreases production costs and poses the potential risk of environmental pollution. The lack of \nagrochemical residue-testing capacity at government agencies threatens food safety and access \nto premium-price marketing opportunities. \n \n6.  Inadequate technical and institutional management capacity. Small farm sizes with \ninadequate access to efficient and climate-resilient irrigation limit the scope for productivity and quality-\nenhancing  mechanization.  Individual  small-scale  farmers  lack  access  to  improved  production \ntechnologies, which require larger-scale operations to be profitable. About 300 cooperatives and \n35,000 households in the country grow vegetables on plots of up to 100 ha, but the total sown area \nwas only 8,904 ha in 2018.3 Cooperative and farmer incomes are low and opportunities curtailed. In \nthe  absence  of  post-harvest  and  storage  facilities,  and  with  low  awareness  of  value-added \nopportunities and marketing, farmers sell their vegetables mainly to middlemen. \n \n7.  Government policy. Backed by its Sustainable Development Vision 2030, Government \nAction Plan, 2016\u20132020, and State Policy on Food and Agriculture and Crop Production Law, \nMongolia is committed to improve vegetable production.7 The state policy stresses the need to \nstrengthen agricultural productivity and production management through a value chain approach, \nadaptation to climate change, and capacity building for farmers. The government targets for local \nvegetable production to meet 70% of domestic demand by 2020, and 100% by 2025, through \nsupport for initiatives such as on-farm mechanization, climate-resilient greenhouses, and water-\nsaving  irrigation  technology.  Policies  prioritizing  smallholder  farming  offer  an  enabling \nenvironment for meeting these targets. Following on from Mongolia\u2019s National Programme for \nFood Security (2009\u20132016),8 the government intends to enhance water productivity and expand \nthe country\u2019s irrigated land from 54,000 ha in 2019 to 120,000 ha by 2030. \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The project is in line with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) by creating knowledge and promoting rural development and food security.9 Supporting a \ndiversified agriculture sector with inclusive economic growth is a key strategic priority for ADB in \nits country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020.10 The project will help improve the water \nproductivity and climate resilience of irrigation systems, expand vegetable production and value \nchain links, and institutionalize residue testing for food safety, which is consistent with the four \n \n7  Sustainable Development Vision 2030 aims to increase irrigated land by adopting new and efficient irrigation \ntechnologies on 65,000 ha by 2020 (100,000 ha by 2025, 120,000 ha by 2030); boost farmland fertility; and curb soil \ndegradation. \n8  Government of Mongolia. 2009.

The project design incorporates lessons from previous and ongoing projects \nfinanced by ADB and others in Mongolia, as well as from project preparation.12 Accordingly, the \nproject responds to the need to (i) support government executing and implementing agencies in \ndeveloping their project implementation capacity; (ii) expand the capacity of design institutes to \nidentify and apply modern water-efficient irrigation methods in subproject designs; (iii) enable the \ncareful  design  of  water-efficient  irrigation  systems  that  support  climate-smart  agricultural \nproduction;  (iv)  promote  sound  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  upgraded  systems, \nparticularly through community grower groups (CGGs), to ensure their long-term sustainability; \nand  (v)  help  set  up  CGGs  and  introduce  them  to  climate-smart  production  technologies, \nparticularly for vegetables. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: income generation and enterprise support \nfor smallholder vegetable farmers increased.13 The project will have the following outcome: \nefficiency of climate-resilient agricultural production and marketing increased.14 \n \n11.  Output 1: Efficient and climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure and management \nsystems installed. The project team will focus on (i) upgrading, modernizing, and climate-\nproofing irrigation and drainage infrastructure;15 (ii) strengthening coordination and management \nof irrigation services, irrigated land, and irrigation infrastructure, including storage ponds to build \nresilience  against  prolonged  droughts,  to  ensure  efficient,  reliable,  and  equitable  irrigation \nsupplies for agricultural land; and (iii) planting trees for shelter belts around the modernized \nirrigated areas. The team will upgrade, modernize, and climate-proof 12 selected schemes along \nwith directly associated infrastructure to provide irrigation services for 7,000 ha.16 The project will \nfinance the remodeling and improvement of main, secondary, and tertiary canals or pipes, \ndrainage facilities, field application systems, such as high-efficiency center pivot sprinkler systems \nand drip irrigation for 240 ha, and associated structures; and, where needed, construction of new \naccess roads and windbreaks. Soum (district) governments will be strengthened to conduct O&M \nof irrigation systems and will pilot a modern asset management system. The project will create \n240 jobs during construction, of which 40% are earmarked for women and 10% for households \nheaded by women; and ensure that all contracts for the 3,094 households to be involved in the \nfarming of new vegetable plots will be co-signed by women. \n \n12.  Output 2: Environmentally sustainable agricultural production systems improved. \nThe project aims to improve food safety, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience of \nagricultural  production  systems,  focusing  specifically  on  agrochemical  residue  testing  and \nsupporting the implementation of a new law on plant seeds by promoting the introduction of new \nhigh-yielding and climate-resilient vegetable seed varieties.

This is expected to reduce the use of \nharmful agrochemicals and to build consumer trust in domestically produced vegetables. The \nproject team will coordinate with the national extension center to support four regional crop \nresearch institutes (CRIs) by (i) providing equipment and facilities such as climate-controlled \ngrowth chambers, storage cool rooms, sheds, fencing, mechanization packages, seed cleaning \nand packaging equipment, conservation farming equipment, and teaching facilities; (ii) conducting \nsmall-scale irrigation rehabilitation and modernization; and (iii) providing greenhouses and low-\ncarbon solutions to extend the cropping seasons and achieve high-value vegetable and quality \nseedling production. This is expected to increase the production capacity for vegetable seeds by \n0.65 tons and for seed potatoes by 10 tons.17 A total of 20 women researchers and 192 women \nfrom CGGs will be given technical support and training on best practices. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Technical,  institutional,  and  management  capacity  and  coordination \nstrengthened. The project team will set up 48 CGGs in the 12 irrigation schemes, which target \nwomen for 40% of the membership and 25% of leadership positions; and provide training on \nimproved vegetable production for 480 CGG participating farmers, including 40% women, in \ncollaboration with the CRIs. The two main providers of extension services to vegetable farmers \nwill be crop research centers such as the Institute of Plant and Agriculture Science, and a \nfacilitation partner such as a local nongovernment organization. Project-supported CRIs will \nprovide capacity building on good agricultural practice and integrated pest management for \nfarmers\u2019 improved management of natural resources with less use of agrochemicals, more use of \nclimate-smart agriculture practices, and better vegetable production, processing and marketing \ntechniques. To further strengthen CGGs, the project will provide mechanization technology \npackages, all-weather greenhouses with solar-powered heating and long-life films, and small cool \nrooms for product storage. The equipment will be provided through a combination of ADB loan \nand JFPR grant to the soum governments, which can then make it available to the CGGs based \non predetermined eligibility criteria.18 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  Innovations. The project design contains innovative features such as (i) adoption of high-\nefficiency irrigation technology in cold regions; (ii) greater food safety and less environmental \npollution by building the residue-testing capacity of the IPP; (iii) summer and winter greenhouses, \nincluding  low-carbon  options  for  water-efficient  production  of  high-value  crops  and  longer \ncropping seasons; (iv) promotion of a plan to allocate land within the upgraded irrigation schemes \nto poor and disadvantaged households and train them in the production of high-value crops, \nincluding vegetables; and (v) integration of an easy-to-use asset management system with \nremote-sensing technology that helps diagnose irrigation performance and resolve problems in a \ntimely manner. Stronger resilience to climate change is achieved by (i) replacing open distribution \ncanals with buried pipes to significantly reduce maintenance costs and water loss; (ii) adopting \nmodern center pivot and lateral move sprinklers that can be programmed for efficient irrigation; \nand (iii) introducing greenhouses that contribute to a more circular use of inputs, including water. \n \n \n17 This will build on achievements of other interventions for drought-resilient seeds, such as those funded by \nInternational Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n18 The criteria for determining eligibility are that (i) a CGG is in place with effective government and management \narrangements, and (ii) a plan is agreed by all members as to how farmers in the group will have equitable access to \nmachinery and facilities. \n ", "5 \n15.  Knowledge sharing. ADB published project preparation lessons and market opportunities \nin a technical report which identified opportunities for ADB financed public sector interventions to \nenhance smallholder participation in vegetable value chains.19 The project\u2019s innovative climate-\nsmart  agriculture  concept  with  a  focus  on  water  productivity  offers  a  unique  opportunity  to \ndemonstrate value-added modern agriculture practices to other developing member countries. The \nproject\u2019s experience with the remote-sensing system for monitoring the modernized irrigation \nschemes will be documented and disseminated through regional technical assistance to further \ndevelop remote-sensing tools for diagnosis, investments, repairs, and the management of irrigation \nschemes in other developing member countries.20 \n \nD.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 16). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2020\u2013September 2026 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  A multisector steering committee, chaired by the MOFALI state secretary and \nincluding representatives from other central agencies, will provide guidance \non the project. \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOFALI \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Crop Production Development Policy Coordination Department, MOFALI \n(iv)  Implementation unit  A project implementation unit will be established in MOFALI to coordinate \nand oversee the project\u2019s detailed implementation. \nStaff: The project implementation unit will be staffed by eight individual \nconsultants hired under the project. \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  3 contracts  $11.147 million \n(internationally advertised) \nOpen competitive bidding  25 contracts  $20.531 million \n(nationally advertised) \n \n21 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nRequest for quotation  6 contracts  $0.150 million \nCommunity participation  24 contracts  $0.588 million \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  4 contracts  $0.210 million \nQuality- and cost-based  2 contracts  $1.593 million \nselection \nConsultant qualifications  3 contracts  $0.569 million \nselection \nLeast-cost selection  1 contract  $0.060 million \nDirect contracting  1 contract  $0.040 million \nAdvance contracting   Three contracts with an estimated value of $1.003 million are likely to be \nawarded in advance contracting. \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MOFALI = Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The project feasibility study considered alternatives and identified the most suitable after \nconsideration  of  the  anticipated  climate  change  impacts,  irrigation  scheme  performance, \nenvironmental impacts, cost, resource use effectiveness, and O&M requirements. Key adaptation \nmeasures include using reliable and efficient water control, distribution, and application practices; \nlow-impact headworks; diversification into climate-resilient crops; and adoption of climate-smart \ncultivation practices. Greenhouse gas emission savings are achieved by minimizing the need for \npower  to  distribute  water  and  operate  equipment.  Climate  resilience  measures  include \nincorporating  infrastructure  practices  against  frost  damage;  reducing  water  use;  providing \nprotection measures against runoff and wind erosion; introducing cropping and tillage practices \nto minimize soil disturbance; extending cropping seasons; and gradually improving overall ground \ncover and the organic matter content of soil. Environmental sustainability will be enhanced by \nreducing the use of agrochemicals through integrated pest management, stabilizing water source \naccess, protecting land and soil from erosion, and reducing annual river channel disturbances. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  The economic analysis indicated that the overall project is economically viable, with an \neconomic internal rate of return of 20.2% and an economic net present value of MNT112.0 billion. The \nanalysis also confirmed the economic viability of the 12 irrigation subprojects. Sensitivity analysis \nindicated that the project is robust against the negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in \ninvestment costs, a reduction in benefits, and an increase in O&M costs. The financial analysis included \n(i) a fiscal sustainability analysis to assess the capacity of the final borrower, the Government of \nMongolia, to provide sufficient funds for all incremental recurrent costs incurred by the project;22 and    \n(ii) an analysis of the financial statements of the CRIs and IPP. \n \n \n \n \n22 While the soum governments will be responsible for financing and implementing the O&M of headworks and main \ncanals, their financial capacity is limited, and they are expected to have to rely on financing from the central \ngovernment. \n ", "8 \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  The sustainability of the outcomes and outputs will be maintained over the economic life of \nthe project by a combination of ensuring proper O&M of the equipment provided for the irrigation \nschemes and establishing the CGGs in a sustainable manner. Proper O&M will be achieved by \nformulating procurement activities to achieve the standardization of irrigation equipment across the \nsubprojects, inclusion in the equipment contracts of the requirement to provide training and manuals \non O&M to project consultants, soum officials, and key subproject participants, as well as other \npersons involved. The Government will be responsible for O&M of irrigation infrastructure and the \nproject will support the Government with drafting a policy for irrigation service payments. The \nsustainability of the CGGs will be promoted by their formalization, capacity building by the facilitation \nteam,  diversification  of  production,  and  promotion  of  processing  to  increase  crop  incomes. \nMitigation measures relating to the project\u2019s institutional, environmental, social, economic, and \nfinancial risks were incorporated into project implementation to minimize the medium- and long-\nterm effects on natural resources, pollution, biodiversity, and financial and economic factors.23 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing and implementing agencies, \nMinistry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Light  Industry  (MOFALI),  including  the  Crop  Production \nDevelopment Policy Coordination Department, is moderate because of (i) weak internal auditing \nfunctions, and (ii) insufficient numbers of accounting and financial management staff in MOFALI. \nThese weaknesses will be mitigated by the inclusion of a financial management specialist in the \nproject implementation unit (PIU). \n \n26.  MOFALI has only one staff member who is directly in charge of procurement. MOFALI \nstaff are already loaded with government duties and their numbers are not sufficient. Therefore, \nthe PIU will include experienced procurement staff to help support  the implementation. The \nprocurement risk assessment confirmed that MOFALI has sufficient experience in project and \nprocurement management of ADB-funded projects, and with this support will be able to fully comply \nwith  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Value for money will be \nachieved by using the lowest evaluated cost option together with appropriate qualification and \ntechnical requirements as main evaluation criteria for the procurement of goods and works; and \nby using scoring systems with an emphasis on quality in the case of consulting services. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOFALI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Poverty and social. The project offers opportunities for inclusive development and \npoverty reduction by enhancing the productivity of vegetable production through stable water \nsupply, training, and provision of technology packages, leading to income generation for farmers. \nLocal  people,  including  poor  households,  are  expected  to  benefit  from  socioeconomic \nopportunities during the project\u2019s implementation and operation. A total of 3,548 households \n(12,261 individuals), including 1,041 poor households (3,599 individuals), are expected to benefit \nfrom the project. This includes 454 households that currently farm vegetable on old land plots in \n \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nthe project irrigation areas and 3,094 households that will be involved in vegetable farming on \nnew land plots. The project will create about 240 local jobs during construction. It will also provide \ntraining to farming households to strengthen vegetable value chains. \n \n29.  The project team prepared a social development action plan (SDAP) based on the poverty \nand social analysis. The SDAP comprises necessary actions and indicators under each output to \nensure benefits for smallholder farmers, including the poor. The SDAP also includes measures to \nmitigate social risks. Consultations were undertaken with stakeholders during project preparation \nand will continue during project implementation. A consultation and participation plan for the \nproject implementation stage is included in the PAM. \n \n30.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.24 Women are involved in \nvegetable production and processing (vegetable pickling, jams, and jellies), but on a small scale, \ni.e., for domestic consumption and local sales. Women\u2019s participation in farmers groups, decision \nmaking,  and  post-harvest  commercial  value  chains  needs  improvement.  The  project  will \nstrengthen women\u2019s capacity for and participation in the entire vegetable value chain activities; \nand they are expected to significantly benefit from the project. The project team prepared a gender \naction plan (GAP) based on the gender analysis to ensure that the project contributes to improved \ngender equality. The GAP targets that (i) 100% of documents for the engagement of households \nin vegetable production, including allocation of new land plots, are co-signed by women; (ii) 40% \nof  jobs  during  construction  are  for  women;  (iii)  30%\u201350%  of  participants  in  consultation, \nawareness-raising, and training activities are women; (iv) women account for 40% of members \nand 25% of leadership positions in the CGGs; (v) 50% of farmers receiving improved seeds and \ntechnology packages are women; and (vi) women are given specific training on vegetable \nprocessing and marketing techniques. Key gender targets are also included in the design and \nmonitoring framework. \n \n31.  Capacity  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  plans.  MOFALI  has  experience  in \nimplementing ADB projects, including an ongoing ADB-administered and JFPR financed vegetable \nproduction project (footnote 12). The PIU under MOFALI will implement and monitor the GAP and \nSDAP. To implement social and gender measures properly, (i) the PIU will include a social and gender \nspecialist; and (ii) MOFALI and project soums will appoint social and gender focal points for \nimplementing, monitoring, and reporting on the social and gender measures listed in the SDAP and \nthe GAP. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. 25 \n \n33.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination report, including an environmental management plan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.26 An environment safeguard specialist will be included in the PIU \nand  will  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  A  project \ngrievance redress mechanism is also in place. \n \n \n24 ADB. 2012. Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Project. Manila. \n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n26 ADB. 2013.

The project will contribute to environmental benefits through the introduction of water-\nefficient irrigation infrastructure and management practices, and the promotion of organic fertilizer \nand integrated pest management. Environmental risks arise from (i) potentially unsustainable \nlevels of water extraction; (ii) construction of large rock barriers and weirs to channel water for \nirrigation\u2014these may affect flow regimes and, for three subprojects, will be the first water \ninfrastructure  to  be  introduced  on  otherwise  natural  rivers;  (iii)  potential  expanded  use  of \nagricultural chemicals; and (iv) ecological impacts of one subproject located within an important \nbiodiversity area. The project accounts for these risks to the extent possible through (i) hydrological \nmodeling, which confirms that all source rivers have adequate water supply to meet irrigation \nneeds and comply with national environmental flow requirements; (ii) procedures for measuring, \nreporting, and enforcing water allocation and environmental flow volumes; (iii) weir designs to \nretain natural free-flowing rivers; (iv) training for improved agricultural practices; and (v) ecological \nsurveys to clarify sites\u2019 ecological values and ensure that impacts on biodiversity are avoided. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project is not expected to have involuntary \nresettlement impacts. All civil works will be implemented on state-owned land and will not involve \nacquisition of nonstate land, physical or economic displacement, or restriction on land use. No \nlegacy issues were found in any of the irrigation schemes. In Nogoon Khashaa (Uliastai soum) \neight households and one company hold land possession or ownership rights along the existing \nmain canal that will be covered and lined within the existing rights of way without permanent land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The households and the company were consulted during \nproject  preparation  regarding  potential  temporary  impacts  on  gardens  and  fences  during \nconstruction,  and  they  support  the  canal\u2019s  upgrade.  Any  structures  that  may  be  impacted \ntemporarily during construction will be compensated for a replacement cost or will be reinstated \nby contractors under the project. ADB prepared a resettlement framework to address temporary \nimpacts during construction and any unanticipated impacts during project implementation. The \nresettlement framework is included in the PAM. The ADB loan will provide consultant support to \nhelp MOFALI follow the resettlement framework during the project implementation. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to have any impacts on \ndistinct and vulnerable communities of ethnic minorities that would trigger the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement on indigenous people. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.
