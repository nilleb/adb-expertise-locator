Therefore,  this  intervention  is \nclassified  as  equivalent  to  environmental  category  FI.  NTPC's \ncorporate  environment  policy  and  environmental  management \nsystem  was  reviewed.  It  provides  the  overall  framework  for \nenvironmental  management  in  accordance  with  the  requirements \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  ADB  identified  some \nareas \nto \nimplement such recommendations. \n \nNotwithstanding  the  corporate  loan  classification,  the  two  projects \nto  be  funded  by  the  loan  are  each  classified  as  environmental \ncategory A. The environmental impact assessment for each project \nwas prepared and reviewed, site visits undertaken, and a summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  of  both  projects  circulated  to \nADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  29 \nMarch 2006.  \n \nCompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples was also assessed, and in view of the fact that \nresettlement  and  land  acquisition  has  already  been  satisfactorily \ncompleted  in  each  location,  a  category  C  was  assigned  for  both \nprojects.  NTPC  and  the  relevant  district  authorities  verified  the \nsatisfactory  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  compensatory \npayments. \n \nA  direct  loan  comprising  (i)  a  tranche  of  $75  million  to  be  loaned \ndirectly  to  NTPC,  and  (ii)  a  tranche  of  $225  million  to  be \nparticipated in by commercial banks under ADB\u2019s Complementary \nFinance  Scheme.  The  loan  will  finance  a  portion  of  NTPC\u2019s \nplanned  power  generation  capacity  expansion,  including  a  portion \nof  the  foreign  exchange  requirements  of  (i)  the  Sipat  Super \nThermal Power Plant Project (stages I and II) located in Bilaspur, \nChattisgarh;  and  (ii)  the  Kahalgaon  Thermal  Power  Plant  Project \n(Stage II) in Bhagalpur, Bihar. \n \nNTPC plans to commission a total of nearly 9,160 megawatts (MW) \nby the end of the 10th Plan (FY2007), including 3,710 MW in 2006. \n\n\fFinancial Performance  \n\niv \n\n \n\nBenefits \n\nNTPC  intends  to  double  capacity  to  46,461  MW  at  an  estimated \ncost of Rs700 billion ($15.5 billion) by the end of FY2012 (i.e., end \nof the 11th Plan). This equates to annual average expenditures of \nRs117 billion ($2.6 billion).  \n \nNTPC  has  developed  its  financing  strategy  based  in  large  part  on \nthe  tariff  norms  laid  out  by  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission.  These  norms  require  that  all  projects  must  be \nfinanced  by  a  debt  to  equity  ratio  of  not  less  than  70:30.  NTPC\u2019s \ninternal  cash  generation  from  operations  is  sufficient  to  fund  the \nequity  requirement,  which  earns  a  fixed  rate  of  return  of  14% \nthrough the tariff. With annual average expenditures of $2.6 billion \nequivalent per annum, NTPC must raise approximately $1.8 billion \nin  debt  each  year  from  a  combination  of  secured  and  unsecured \nsources, both in local and foreign currency. NTPC is not permitted \nunder  the  external  commercial  borrowing  provisions  of  the \nReserve  Bank  of  India  to  borrow  more  than  $500  million \nequivalent  each  year  from  foreign  sources.  Accordingly,  $1.3 \nbillion on average must be sourced each year from Indian banks, \nfinancial institutions, and domestic capital market.  \n \nNTPC retains a BB+ long-term issuer default credit rating by Fitch \nand  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  (S&P)\u2014the  rating  is  equivalent  to  the \nsovereign  rating  of  India  (i.e.,  as  a  majority  Government-owned \ncompany,  NTPC  is  constrained  by  the  sovereign  rating).  S&P \nrecently  upgraded  its  outlook  for  the  sovereign  and  NTPC  to \n\u201cpositive\u201d based on overall fiscal improvements in India. Based on \naudited results from FY2005, NTPC generated Rs232 billion ($5.2 \nbillion)  in  revenues,  Rs66  billon  ($1.5  billion)  in  operating  profit, \nand  Rs58  billion  ($1.3  billion)  in  net  profit  after  tax.  Revenue \ngrowth  is  principally  driven  by  capacity  additions  and  tariffs. \nRevenue  surged  16.9%  in  FY2005  with  the  commissioning  of \n2,000 MW of new capacity.  \n \nDespite  an  ambitious  capital  expansion  plan,  NTPC  has  strong \ncoverage \nincome,  debt  service \ncoverage,  and  interest  coverage  ratios  were  3.1,  4.8,  and  9.5 \nrespectively  for  the  estimated  financial  statements  ending  March \n2006, supported by regular strong cash flows. Its total liabilities to \nnet worth ratio of 0.73 (i.e., 42:58), indicates that the company is \nnot  significantly  leveraged,  and  has  sufficient  headroom  for \nadditional  borrowings  to  match  capital  expansion  plans.  While \n28%  of  its  debt  is  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  foreign \nexchange  risk  is  minimal  as  any  related  losses  can  be  passed \nthrough in the tariffs. While budgeted expenditures will exert some \npressure  on  NTPC\u2019s  credit  ratios,  cash  flows  from  new  facilities \nshould keep coverage ratios at acceptable levels.  \n \nThe benefits of the proposed loan include (i) addition of 4,480 MW \nof  power  generating  capacity  to  help  reduce  the  supply  deficit  in \nIndia;  (ii)  introduction  of  new  thermal  power  plant  technology  in \n\nratios\u2014net  debt/operating \n\n\fv\n\nIndia,  which  will  improve  operational  efficiency,  reduce  fuel \nconsumption,  and  hence  reduce  the  emissions  of  greenhouse \ngases  and  other  pollutants;  (iii)  improvement  of  environmental \nstandards  for  power  plants  owned  and  operated  by  the  largest \nsupplier  of  electricity  in  India;  and  (iv)  facilitation  of  commercial \ncofinancing of $225 million. \n \nThe  main  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  (i) NTPC  credit  risk; \n(ii)  state  electricity  board  counterparty/credit  risk;  (iii)  tariff  and \nregulatory  risk;  (iv)  sector  reform  risk;  (v)  fuel  supply  risk;  (vi) \nsubordination risk (in the event of default or non-payment). These \nrisks  were  addressed  in  the  course  of  due  diligence  and  are \nexplained in detail in this document. \n  \nAs  the  largest  power  generator  in  India,  NTPC\u2019s  operations  and \nexpansion plans are critical to reducing peak power demand and \nenergy deficits that are forecast to persist for at least several more \nyears.  NTPC  is  a  financially  sound  enterprise  with  a  strong \nbalance  sheet,  an  effective  governance  structure,  and \nexperienced  management.  Although  a  state-owned  enterprise, \nNTPC is operated as an independent commercial entity.  \n \nThe proposed intervention is line with recent country strategy and \nprogram  updates  for  India,  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and \nModalities  (2005)  approved  by  the  Board,  and  the  Private  Sector \nOperations Department\u2019s focus on infrastructure financing in India. \n\n

\n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  NTPC  Limited  (formerly  known  as  the  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  Limited),  a \nGovernment  of  India  majority  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE),  to  be  made  available  under  (i)  a \ndirect  loan  tranche  of  up  to  $75  million,  and  (ii)  a  loan  tranche  of  up  to  $225  million  to  be \nadvanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  as  lender  of  record  under  ADB\u2019s \nComplementary Financing Scheme (CFS). If approved, the loan will be ADB\u2019s first financing of \nan  SOE  pursuant  to  the  issuance  of  the  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments and Modalities paper.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n2. \nAlthough  India\u2019s  power  sector  has  expanded  rapidly  in  the  past  few  years,  power \nshortages,  and  poor  quality  and  reliability  of  supply  constrain  economic  growth.  Despite \nmoderate growth in power generation capacity, India has a large supply deficit that will persist for \nat least several years. In 2005, the national peak power deficit was 12% and energy deficit 7%. \nAs the current 10th Plan targets (if met) would fulfill only 75% of needed capacity additions by \n2007,  peak  power  and  energy  shortfalls  will  persist  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  The \nGovernment has set an ambitious target of providing Power for All by 2012 during the 10th and \n11th  plans.  Based  on  the  16th  Electricity  Power  Survey,  prepared  by  the  Central  Electricity \nAuthority  (CEA),2  India  will  require  additional  capacity  of  nearly  100,000  megawatts  (MW)3  by \n2012  to  achieve  this  goal.  As  the  largest  power  generator  in  India,  NTPC\u2019s  ability  to  increase \nsupply plays a fundamental role in the economic development targets. \n \n3. \nTo  finance  these  expansion  plans,  NTPC  has  developed  certain  capital  raising \nstrategies. These strategies have in large part been influenced by a regulatory tariff order issued \nin 2004.4 In order to optimize its returns in line with this tariff order, NTPC is seeking to ensure \nthat its debt component is not less than 70% of its overall capital employed, and of this amount, \n30%  needs  to  be  sourced  in  foreign  currency.  Bank  of  America,  a  leading  international \ncommercial  bank,  approached  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  with  a  goal  of \narranging  commercial,  nonsovereign  US  dollar  lending  for  NTPC.  The  loan  would  finance  a \nportion  of  the  foreign  exchange  requirement  of  its  fiscal  2007  capital  expenditures.  Bank  of \nAmerica identified ADB as a finance partner with the strengths needed to create a loan package \nthat would assist NTPC in its capital raising plan. Due to commercial bank credit limits on cross-\nborder (i.e., offshore) lending, tenors of syndicated bank loans of this magnitude are limited to 5 \nyears,  with  a  few  exceptional  cases  of  7  years.  The  financing  of  power  generation  plants \ntypically  require  tenors  of  10\u201312  years  (including  grace  periods)  to  amortize  the  debt  to  be \nrecovered  from  end-user  tariffs.  Accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  ability  and  development  role  to  provide \nlonger  term  financing  was  seen  as  a  significant  strength.  Therefore,  Bank  of  America  as  the \nproposed lead arranger approached ADB in June 2005 to express their interest in participating \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

New Delhi. \n3   This  figure  was  determined  by  CEA  based  on  actual  demand  growth  for  the  previous  5  years  and  based  on \naverage GDP growth of 7.4% per annum and gradual reductions in transmission and distribution losses to 18.5% in \n2011\u20132012. Based on recent GDP growth, these figures could possibly be understated. To date, no update of the \nElectric Power Survey has been finalized. \n\n4   Under the Electricity Act, 2003, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issued a national tariff order \nestablishing the post-tax rate of return on equity at 14%, not on total capital employed, for both public and private \ngenerators. As CERC prescribes the debt-equity ratio for new projects at 70:30, any equity financing in excess of \nthe stipulated 30% benchmark will not attract the 14% rate of return, but, instead, only the stipulated cost of interest \nfor that project. \n\n\f2   \n \n\n \n\nin ADB\u2019s CFS or lender of record facility. This would be coupled with an ADB direct loan. The \nconcept clearance for this transaction was approved in July 2005, environmental and social site \nvisits conducted in November 2005, and due diligence mission completed in April 2006. \n \n\nIII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPower Sector in India \n\n1. \n\nStructure of the Power Sector \n\n \n4. \nThe  Indian  power  sector  is  broadly  divided  into  utilities  owned  by  the  central \nGovernment, state governments, and private sector. The central power sector utilities5 (CPSUs), \nincluding NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India (Powergrid),6 participate in the wholesale \npower supply and interstate bulk transmission. The state sector is operated by state electricity \nboards  (SEBs)  or  unbundled  state  utilities.  SEBs  were  established  as  integrated  state \nmonopolies  by  the  Electricity  Supply  Act  of  1948  to  engage  in  generation  and  intrastate \ntransmission and distribution. In recent years, some states (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and \nOrissa)  have  unbundled  their  SEBs  into  separate  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ncompanies.  The  private  sector  comprises  relatively  small  independent  power  producers, \noperating roughly 10% of India\u2019s total capacity. Some private companies have also established \na presence in unbundled distribution companies.  \n \n5. \nThe  central  and  state  governments  share  responsibility  for  development  of  the  power \nindustry.  The  Ministry  of  Power  (MOP)  governs  the  central  power  sector  in  the  country  and \noversees  CPSU  operation.  CEA  advises  MOP  on  electricity  policy  and  technical  matters.  The \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (CERC),  created  in  1998  under  the  Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission  Act,  regulates  tariffs  for  the  CPSUs  and  other  entities  with  interstate \ngeneration  or  transmission  operations.  This  act,  which  has  since  been  replaced  by  the \nElectricity Act (2003), also provided for the formation of state electricity regulatory commissions \nto  rationalize  energy  tariffs  and  formulate  policy  within  each  state.  As  of  31  March  2005,  24 \nstates  had  established  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions.  Additional  background  on  the \npower sector is given in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2. \n\nSupply and Demand  \n\n \n6. \nIndia  is  the  third  largest  electricity  consumer  in  Asia  behind  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina  and  Japan.  As  of  30  September  2005,  India\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  was \n123,014  MW,  of  which  57%  is  owned  and  operated  by  state  entities,  32%  by  central  public \nsector  undertakings  (such  as  NTPC),  and  11%  by  independent  power  producers.  Thermal \nplants, mostly coal-fired, provide 66% of the installed capacity. Hydropower comprises 26% of \nthe capacity, and the remaining 8% is provided by gas and oil-fired thermal plants, renewable \nenergy plants, and nuclear plants. However, despite its ever-growing population and economy, \nIndia\u2019s consumption remains relatively low at 606 kilowatt-hours per capita per annum.  \n \nPower demand in India has grown rapidly since the 1980s as the economic growth has \n7. \naccelerated  at  an  annual  average  of  5.6%  since  1980.  Under  MOP\u2019s  Power  for  All  by  2012 \n\n                                                 \n5  Other  CPSUs  include  the  National  Hydroelectric  Power  Corporation,  Nuclear  Power  Corporation,  Power  Finance \n\nCorporation, and Rural Electrification Corporation. \n\n6   In 1992, the central entity known today as Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (Powergrid) was established to \n\nconstruct, operate, and maintain interstate and interregional transmission systems. \n\n\f 3 \n\ninitiative,  target  capacity  is  being  expanded  to  maintain  India\u2019s  current  8%  economic  growth \nrate. Of total electricity sold in India, industry accounts for approximately 33%, agriculture and \nhouseholds  for  25%  each,  and  businesses  and  others  for  the  remaining  17%.  Power  demand \ngrowth has slowed in recent years to approximately 2\u20133%, not due to a lack of demand, but due \nto  inadequate  capacity  and  poor  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure.  Power  quality \nremains poor, marked by high voltage fluctuations and recurring load shedding. India continues \nto  suffer  from  chronic  electricity  shortage,  where  peak  demand  exceeds  supply  by  over  12%; \nthe energy deficit between April and September 2005 was 7%.7 As the current 10th Plan fulfills \nonly  75%  of  needed  capacity  additions  to  2007,  energy  shortfalls  will persist  over  the  short  to \nmedium term. The Government of India seeks to eliminate this deficit by 2012, which marks the \nend of the next 5-year plan (the 11th Plan, 2008\u20132012).  \n \n\n3. \n\nGeneration Expansion under the 10th and 11th Plans \n\n \n8. \nAs of 30 September 2005, India's power system had an installed generation capacity of \napproximately  123,014  MW.  The  Government\u2019s  successive  5-year  plans  set  out  targets  for \neconomic development in various sectors, including the power sector. Each successive 5-year \nplan  has  increased  power  generation  capacity  addition  targets.  The  9th  Plan  (1998\u20132002) \ntargeted  a  capacity  addition  of  40,245  MW,  of  which  24%  was  to  come  from  hydro  capacity, \n73%  from  thermal  capacity,  and  the  remainder  from  nuclear  capacity.  However,  only  about \n19,251 MW or 48% of the planned capacity addition was actually added. The target for capacity \naddition  is  set  at  41,110  MW  under  the  10th  Plan  (2003\u20132007).  Exactly  how  much  will  be \ncommissioned before the end of this fiscal year is not yet clear, although general agreement is \nthat the target will not be met. With the Government\u2019s ambitious target of providing Power for All \nby 2012 during the 10th and 11th plans, India will require additional capacity of nearly 100,000 \nMW  by  2012  to  achieve  the  goal.  As  the  largest  generator  in  India,  NTPC\u2019s  ability  to  expand \npower  generation  capacity  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  the  country  meeting  its  economic \ndevelopment targets. \n\n \n4. \n\nPower Sector and Regulatory Reform \n\n  \n9. \nNTPC sells its generation capacity to all SEBs in India (except for a few in the northeast \nregion). In the past, NTPC was perennially exposed to the problem of large accounts receivable \nfrom  the  weaker  SEBs.  The  SEBs  have  been  plagued  by  poor  metering,  low  collections,  high \nreceivables,  and  high  theft/losses,  and  were  unable  to  recover  those  losses  through  tariff \nincreases.  As  with  most  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  tariffs  in  India  are  politically \nsensitive  and  are  held  at  artificially  low  levels  for  political  and  social  reasons.  Many  states \nprovide subsidized electricity to farmers and disadvantaged households, which results in tariffs \nthat are significantly below the cost of supply.  \n \nDuring  the  early  1990s,  the  SEB-dominated  power  industry  became  a  drain  on  the \n10. \nIndian economy and changes were needed in the context of the Government\u2019s economic reform \nprogram.  The  Government  initially  focused  on  increasing  investment  in  power  generation  by \nopening up participation to private power providers and offering to fast-track projects. However it \nmade little progress with this effort, as only a handful of projects reached financial close, and the \nreforms did not address the underlying fundamental weaknesses of the SEBs, which lost ever \nlarger sums with each kilowatt-hour bought from new suppliers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Ministry of Power monthly statistics. \n\n \n\n\f4   \n \n\n \n\nreforms, \n\nincluded \n\nreform.  The  program \n\n(i)  organizational  state \n\nTo  address  state  and  national  difficulties,  a  reform  program  was  initiated  in  the  mid \n11. \n1990s  based  on  the  recommendations  of  a  high-profile  Government  commission  on  power \nsector \nincluding \ncommercialization and unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) regional and \nnational organizational reforms to strengthen the role of CPSUs; (iii) large-scale involvement of \nthe private sector in generation and distribution, through transparent and competitive selection \nprocesses; (iv) creation of a central regulator to regulate bulk tariffs and state regulator for small \ngeneration  and  end-user  tariffs  and  thus  to  depoliticize  electricity  tariff  setting;  and  (v)  a \nprogressive phase out of subsidies to agricultural consumers and increase of tariffs to be more \nreflective  of  the  cost  of  supply.  While  the  suggested  reforms  emanated  from  the  central \nGovernment, states were given flexibility to choose their own reform path, which had very mixed \nresults.8 The lack of competitive standards in the power sector, an emphasis on privatization for \nits  own  sake  rather  than  for  effecting  improvements  in  quality  of  supply  and  consumer \nsatisfaction, the seeking of higher returns on investment without corresponding improvements in \nsupply,  and  improper  sequencing  undermined  the  gains  made  in  nonpolitical  and  transparent \ntariff setting and private sector participation in the sector. The well-publicized failures of reform \nin certain states stalled any progress or political will in the others.  \n \n12.   A much stronger central government role was required to accelerate the reform process. \nIn 1998, the Government enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, which led to the \nestablishment  of  an  independent  central  regulatory  commission  (CERC)  and  state-level \nequivalents  (state  electricity  regulatory  commissions).  In  2003,  the  more  comprehensive \nElectricity  Act  was  promulgated,  which  consolidated  existing  legislation  in  the  sector  under  a \nsingle  act  and  includes  provisions  to  improve  competition  and  efficient  use  of  resources.  It \nincludes  initiatives  to  (i)  liberalize  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  (ii)  remove  the \ncauses  of  the  SEB  crisis;  (iii)  upgrade  the  central  and  state  regulatory  infrastructure;  and  (iv) \nimprove  coordination  between  the  central  and  state  governments  in  planning  and  developing \nthe  power  sector.  The  Government  formulated  a  national  tariff  policy  and  national  electricity \npolicy  in  consultation  with  CEA,  CERC,  and  the  state  governments.  While  progress  of  sector \nreform continues to be slow, these recent legislative changes, new financial penalties to enforce \ngrid  discipline  by  the  SEBs,  and  the  settlement  of  past  dues  (para.  13)  seem  to  have  put  the \nsector  on  the  road  to  recovery  and  curtailed  the  financial  problems  of  the  SEBs,  which  had \ninfected the sector as a whole.  \n \n\n5. \n\nOne-Time Settlement of SEB Debts \n\n \nThe  growing  SEB  losses  eventually  triggered  Government  intervention  in  April  2002, \n13. \nwhen  MOP  announced  a  plan  aimed  at  settling  the  SEBs\u2019  overdue  debts,  including  those  to \nNTPC,  through  tripartite  agreements  signed  by  MOP,  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  and  each  of  the \nstates. Under the terms of the agreements, the states settled Rs320.3 billion ($7.1 billion) of the \nSEBs\u2019 debt by issuing 8.5% tax-free bonds (via the Reserve Bank of India) to the CPSUs (e.g., \nNTPC,  Powergrid),  effectively  swapping  poor  receivables  for  quasi-sovereign,  interest-bearing \ninstruments. The state governments issued bonds worth Rs164.1 billion ($3.6 billion) to NTPC \nin  lieu  of  past  SEB  debts.  If  a  SEB  falls  more  than  90  days  behind  on  current  dues,  several \npenalties  are  in  place  including  reduction  of  power  supply  from  the  CPSUs,  Government \nsuspension  of  funds  under  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  Reform  Program,  or \n\n                                                 \n8   The  failures  of  the  unbundling  and  privatization-driven  efforts  in  Orissa  were  well-publicized.  However,  the \nexperience  in  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  which  focused  on  restructuring  through  corporatization,  was  more \npositive.  The  reform  efforts  in  the  National  Capital  Region  of  Delhi  provided  some  positive  results  by  introducing \nprivate distribution concessions, but no final conclusion can be drawn as yet. \n\n\f 5 \n\nChallenges and Opportunities \n\nadjustments against release of central Government assistance and share of federal tax revenue \nto  the  states.  The  SEBs  are  also  required  to  open  letters  of  credit  with  commercial  banks  in \nfavor  of  NTPC,  covering  105%  of  the  average  monthly  billing  for  the  preceding  12  months  of \nsales to secure current electricity sales. Additional incentives are in place for timely settlement \nby  the  SEBs  on  current  dues,  including  a  small  reduction  in  bond  face  value  and  rebates  on \ncurrent  dues.  NTPC\u2019s  cash  collections  against  current  billings  have  shown  substantial \nimprovement as a result\u2014from about 76% in fiscal 2002 to over 100%9 since fiscal 2004. Once \nthe immediate pressures of its overdue receivables were alleviated through the settlement, the \nresulting improvement in the cash resources of the SEBs strengthened their capacity to pay on \ntime,  improved  metering  and  collections  in  the  interim,  and  permitted  them  to  focus  on \ninstitutional  reform  efforts.  Additional  details  of  this  settlement  scheme  are  contained  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nConsidering  the  existing  supply-demand  gap  and  the  expected  increase  in  per  capita \nconsumption  (in  view  of  the  overall  GDP  growth  targets  for  the  economy),  the  16th  Electricity \nPower Survey has projected a peak load demand of 157,107 MW and energy demand of 975 \nbillion  kilowatt-hours  by  the  end  of  March  2012  (i.e.,  end  of  the  11th  Plan).  To  meet  this \nprojected growth in peak demand and account for transmission and distribution system losses, \nIndia  will  require  212,000  MW  of  generating  capacity  by  2012.  To  accomplish  this  ambitious \ngoal, both the public and private sector will be needed to substantially contribute to generation \nand high-voltage transmission capacity. Given the limited SEB resources and limited success of \nindependent power producers in achieving financial closure of projects,10 the onus of adding to \nthe  country\u2019s  generation  capacity  rests  largely  with  NTPC.  NTPC\u2019s  ability  to  develop  and \nconstruct  large  projects  reasonably  within  budget  and  on  time  is  fundamental  to  India\u2019s \neconomic growth targets.  \n \nThe focus of power sector reforms in the past decade has been on reforming the state \n15. \nregulatory framework and improving the state transmission and distribution networks. On these \naccounts,  moderate  progress  has  been  made.  However,  in  the  process,  power  generation \ncapacity  and  interstate  transmission  investment  programs  have  continued  to  suffer  from \nrelatively  inadequate  attention.  Capacity  additions  have  been  made,  but  not  enough  to  meet \ndemand. Private sector investment in generation to complement public expenditures has been \nvery  limited.  Recent  announcements  by  the  Government  to  promote  the  ultra-mega  power \nprojects (a series of 4,000 MW power generation complexes to be awarded through competitive \nbidding  by  the  end  of  2006)  recognize  this  ongoing  challenge.  The  Government  is  also \nundertaking  plans  through  Powergrid  to  develop  a  national  grid  by  2012,  which  will  involve \nconstruction of 60,000 kilometers of high voltage lines to evacuate 100,000 MW of power from \nnew generating stations. \n \n16. \nImplementation  of  the  2003  Electricity  Act  could  result  in  the  development  of  a  more \ncompetitive market for power in India, but the challenge will be to sustain the pace of national \nand state reform and the relative financial recovery of the sector. The Electricity Act has opened \nup several opportunities for existing power sector players such as NTPC, including direct supply \nto  large  customers,  retail  supply,  distribution,  power  trading,  etc.  In  such  a  competitive \nenvironment,  NTPC  will  continue  to  benefit  from  its  extremely  competitive  tariffs,  multilocation \n\n                                                 \n9  More than 100% were collected in the last fiscal year due to the incentive schemes under the tripartite agreement \n\nand voluntary incentives provided by NTPC before the end of the fiscal year. \n\n10  Only 70 MW of private generation capacity was added in FY2005, and 600 MW added in 2006. \n\n \n\n\f6   \n \n\n \n\nfacilities  (and  diverse  customer  base,  reducing  the  credit  risk  of  any  one  particular  off  taker), \nand  the  ability  to  sell  directly  to  creditworthy  bulk  consumers  who  are  allowed  open  access. \nHowever,  the  Electricity  Act  also  consolidates  existing  reform  programs  and  laws  under  the \nsingle  act,  requiring  SEBs  to  lay  out  a  transitional  period  to  unbundle  and  segregate  their \nbusinesses  and  upgrade  their  transmission  and  distribution  systems  under  an  investment  and \nincentive  scheme  from  the  central  Government.11  Whether  state  regulators  and  governments \ncan sustain the political will to continue the pace of reform, including retail tariff restructuring, to \nensure the long-term financial viability of the state utilities remains to be seen.  \n  \n17. \nAs  demonstrated  by  India\u2019s  15-year  history  of  sector  reforms,  the  economic  benefits \ngenerated by the sector are not sustainable unless the investments in central power generation \nand  transmission  infrastructure  are  accompanied  by  structural  reforms  of  the  state  electricity \nunits. ADB\u2019s sovereign operations have been actively supporting reform and restructuring efforts \nthrough  technical  assistance,  policy  dialogue,  and  loan  operations  in  the  states  of  Assam,12 \nGujarat,13  and  Madhya  Pradesh.14  Support  for  SEB  reforms  in  other  states  (West  Bengal, \nMaharashtra,  and  Tamil  Nadu)  was  also  provided  through  an  onlending  facility  to  Power \nFinance  Corporation.15  ADB  is  currently  supporting  unbundling,  corporatization,  and  other \nreform efforts in Uttaranchal.16 International funding agencies, such as the World Bank and the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, have been active in power sector \nreform  in  other  states  such  as  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Karnataka,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and \nUttar  Pradesh.  Progress  made  at  the  state  level  improves  the  financial  viability  of  the  state\u2019s \nelectric utilities so it has the resources to improve the quality and reliability of power supply and \nexpand  distribution  of  electricity  to  those  not  yet  connected.  Improvements  also  reduce  the \nburden  of  the  power  sector  on  the  state\u2019s  fiscal  position,  so  it  can  allocate  resources  more \nproductively to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development activities. \n \nC. \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n6. \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy for India \n\n \nAs  cited  in  the  most  recent  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),17  the  Government\u2019s \n18. \n10th  Plan  observes  the  growing  impatience  in  the  country  that  \u201ca  large  number  of  our  people \ncontinue to live in abject poverty and there are alarming gaps in social attainments even after \nfive decades of planning.\u201d The 10th Plan emphasizes that development must be defined not just \nin terms of increased GDP but more broadly in terms of human well-being. Thus, the strategy of \n\n                                                 \n11  Known as the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program, the Government provides incentives to the \nstates  for  undertaking  renovation  and  modernization  programs  for  thermal  and  hydropower  stations  and  to \nstrengthen and improve the subtransmission and distribution network. The Government earmarked a total of Rs400 \nbillion  ($8.9  billion)  for  the  program  under  the  10th  Plan.  For  the  investment  component,  the  Government  will \nprovide concessional loans for 50% of the program. Under the incentive component, MOP will make a grant to the \nstates of 50% of the SEBs\u2019 actual cash-loss reductions year-to-year. This component was introduced to motivate \nthe SEBs and utilities to reduce their financial losses. \n\n12 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n\f 7 \n\nthe 10th Plan consists of the themes of high growth, equitable growth, and human development. \nPolitical  and  economic  developments  since  finalizing  the  CSP  indicate  that  its  assistance \nstrategy remains valid, especially the core strategy of poverty reduction through infrastructure-\nled  growth,  supported  by  social  development  and  good  governance.  The  2006\u20132008  CSP18 \nupdate indicates that the objective of accelerating India\u2019s GDP growth to 8% depends critically \non  upgrading  infrastructure  facilities  and  improving  efficiency  of  such  public  services.  ADB\u2019s \nproposed assistance program reflects this priority with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% \nof  the  3-year  pipeline  (not  including  private  sector  and  nonsovereign  operations,  such  as  the \nproposed  loan).  Support  of  strong  governance  programs  and  introduction  of  international  best \npractices  are  essential  to  leverage  and  maximize  the  development  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  relatively \nmodest assistance to the Government. \n \n\n7. \n\nADB\u2019s Power Sector Strategy for India \n\n \n19. \nADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update has six \nmain  priorities:  (i)  reforming  the  sector;  (ii)  promoting  higher  efficiency  and  low-carbon  power \nsources;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iv)  supporting \ninstitutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity Act of 2003, including \ndevelopment of more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) promoting private sector \nparticipation; and (vi) encouraging energy conservation, and ensuring environmental and social \nsustainability. To support the Government\u2019s mission of Power for All by 2012, ADB\u2019s strategy for \nthe  power  sector  will  be  in  synergy  with  the  10th  and  11th  plans.  This  includes  national  and \nstate interventions and specifically references supporting power generation through NTPC.  \n \n\n8. \n\nADB's Nonsovereign Operations in India \n\n \n20. \nADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  should  support  the  main  themes  reflected  in  the \nCSP/CSP updates, specifically the core strategy of poverty reduction through infrastructure-led \ngrowth.  As  documented  in  the  2006\u20132008  CSP  update,  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  will \ncontinue to focus on the infrastructure and financial sectors. The proposed transaction is in line \nwith  the  power  sector  objectives  contained  in  the  CSP  update,  specifically  improving  thermal \nefficiency  in  power  generation  leading  to  reduced  coal  use  and  strengthening  the  country\u2019s \nenvironmental  protection  by  getting  the  dominant  utility  (27%  of  energy  supply)  to  upgrade  its \nenvironmental  standards  for  air  emissions  and  effluent  discharge.  Under  the  Innovation  and \nEfficiency Initiative modalities (footnote 1), ADB will be able to deliver flexible financing solutions \n(such as the proposed loan) in support of interventions with subsovereign entities. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nNTPC is a Government of India majority-owned company engaged in the development, \nconstruction, and operation of mainly thermal power plants in India. As of 31 December 2005, \nthe  total  installed  capacity  of  NTPC  was  24,249  MW,  through  13  coal-fired  power  stations \n(19,980 MW), seven gas-fired power stations (3,955 MW), and three joint venture projects (314 \nMW),  making  it  India\u2019s  largest  generating  company.  NTPC  also  manages  the  operation  of \nBadarpur  power  station  (705  MW)  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  As  of  31  December  2005, \nNTPC's share of the total installed capacity of India was 19.6% and it contributed 27.1% of the \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2005.

Appendix  2  provides  additional \ninformation on NTPC. \n \n22.  Most  NTPC  plants  are  base-load  facilities  by  design  and  are  among  the  lowest  cost \nthermal facilities, with average costs 10\u201350% lower than other thermal generators. The average \nselling  price  of  NTPC's  power  during  FY  2005  was  Rs1.52  ($0.035)  per  kilowatt-hour.  This \nmakes  NTPC  one  of  the  cheapest  sources  of  power  for  most  SEBs,  and  secures  a  favorable \nposition in the merit dispatch order in the states in which it is dispatched. NTPC\u2019s operations are \nalso efficient. Its plant load factor19 improved in FY2005 to 87.5% from 84.4% the previous year, \nand the availability factor of NTPC plants increased to 91.2% from 88.8%.  \n \nB. \n\nNavratna Status \n \n23. \nNTPC  does  not  rely  on  Government  funds  and  is  not  subject  to  any  Government \nbudgetary  approvals.  Based  on  its  financial  and  operational  performance,  in  July  1997  the \nGovernment  named  NTPC  one  of  the  nine  initial  Navratna  (or  nine  jewels)  companies  and \ngranted it enhanced autonomy in making financial and other decisions, including the freedom to \nengage  in  investment,  capital  expenditures,  and  raising  of  funds  at  home  and  internationally \nwithout  Government  approval  or  interference.  NTPC  is  permitted  to  form  joint  ventures  and \nsubsidiaries up to specified limits, subscribe equity in these entities, purchase, and receive new \ntechnology and knowledge transfer. It is permitted to decide the locations for its plants (a matter \npreviously  determined  by  the  Planning  Commission)  and  has  the  freedom  to  independently \nnegotiate  power  purchase  agreements  with  its  customers.  This  status  has  helped  NTPC  to \nincrease the speed of implementing new projects, absorbing new technologies, and formatting \njoint ventures in the core generation as well as support service businesses.  \n \n24. \nLike  other  state-owned  enterprises,  NTPC  enters  into  an  annual  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  performance  monitoring.  The  agreement  sets  annual \nperformance  targets  for  the  physical,  financial,  and  dynamic  parameters  of  NTPC.  These \nparameters  include  total  electricity  generated,  plant  availability  factor,  financial  gross  margin, \nand the ratio of net profit to net worth. At the end of each fiscal year, MOP evaluates NTPC\u2019s \nactual  performance  against  the  targets.  NTPC  has  been  ranked  in  the  excellent  category  (the \nbest category) for the 15th consecutive year since the memorandum of  understanding system \nbecame operative in FY1988. \n \n25. \nNTPC  was  100%  Government  owned  prior  to  its  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  in  October \n2004.  The  IPO  raised  Rs54  billion  ($1.2  billion)  through  the  issuance  of  new  shares  plus \ndivesting  a  portion  of  the  Government\u2019s  shares.  The  Government  now  owns  89.5%  of  NTPC, \nwhile  institutional,  foreign,  and  individual  investors  own  the  remaining  10.5%  of  the  publicly \nlisted shares.20 The current value of NTPC\u2019s share price has nearly doubled since the IPO.21 The \nproceeds from the new shares are being applied to funding NTPC\u2019s capital expansion program. \nThe IPO\u2019s success reflects positive sentiments from both domestic and foreign investors toward \nNTPC\u2019s financial strength, its position in the market, and its growth prospects. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19  The plant load factor is typically a good indicator of a power utility\u2019s efficiency in use of its assets. \n20  After  its  IPO,  only  one  foreign  institutional  investor,  Capital  Research  Management  Company  A/C  Capital  World \nGrowth & Income Fund, holds more than 1% of outstanding shares. The remainder of the shareholders hold less \nthan 1%. Total foreign institutional ownership is approximately 6%. \n\n21  The IPO price was Rs62/share in November 2004. As of 10 May 2006, NTPC\u2019s stock closed at Rs129.60/share. \n\n\f 9 \n\nCorporate Governance \n\nC. \n \n26. \nNTPC\u2019s 11-member board currently comprises five full-time executive directors, and two \npart-time  and  four  independent  directors.22  The  Government  appoints  the  chairperson  and \nmanaging  director  for  a  5-year  tenure,  and  appoints  the  directors  in  consultation  with  the \nchairperson  and  managing  director.  The  current  chairperson  and  managing  director  was \nappointed  on  1  April  2006.  Full  time  directors  are  appointed  for  5-year  terms,  whereas \nindependent  directors  are  appointed  for  3  years.  The  two  part-time  directors  are  MOP \nrepresentatives and remain directors as long as they concurrently serve in MOP. Although the \nGovernment has the power to direct NTPC activities, it has allowed the company to operate as \nan independent, commercial entity.  \n \nNTPC\u2019s  board  of  directors  has  established  several  board  committees  including,  for \n27. \nexample,  an  audit  committee,  a  shareholders/investors  grievance  committee,  investment \ncommittee, and committee on management controls. The audit committee, established with two \nindependent  directors  and  the  two  part-time  directors  (i.e.,  from  MOP),  is  chaired  by  an \nindependent  director.  All  members  of  the  audit  committee  are  qualified  to  interpret  and \nunderstand financial statements. No remuneration committee has been established because the \nBoard does not determine the salaries and tenure of its directors. Like other public enterprises, \nsalaries, directors\u2019 sitting fees, and tenures are determined by the Government. However, NTPC \ndoes disclose the salary, benefits, performance-based incentives, and independent sitting fees \nfor its directors in its annual report.  \n \n28.  While  privatization  of  SOEs  in  India  remains  a  sensitive  and  politically  difficult  task  for \nany  coalition  government,  strong  corporate  governance  reform  can  often  provide  significant \nresults toward improving performance and efficiency of the enterprise. NTPC is often cited as a \nmodel  for  SOE  reform.  Based  on  a  World  Bank  study  on  corporate  governance  reform  in \nSOEs,23 the following reforms were included and have already been implemented by NTPC: \n \n\nsubject  the  utility  to  company  law  and  other  laws  that  apply  to  private  sector \ncompanies; \n\nappoint independent directors to the board and ensure that independent directors \nconstitute at least 50% of directors; \n\nrequire  NTPC  to  borrow  from  commercial  lenders  without  the  benefit  of  a \ngovernment  guarantee,  bringing  to  bear  the  benefits  of  scrutiny  by  commercial \nlenders and international credit-rating agencies;  \n\nlist  a  minority  of  the  company\u2019s  shares  on  public  stock  exchanges,  to  create \nmarket \ninformation  on  commercial  performance  and  create  performance \nmonitoring  by  shareholders  other  than  the  Government  (because  shareholders \nhave  a  residual  rather  than  priority  claim  on  the  firm\u2019s  assets,  the  value  of \nminority  shareholders\u2019  investments  in  the  utility  depends  more  strongly  on \nperformance of the utility compared with the lenders); and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n22  Clause  49  issued  by  the  Securities  Exchange  Board  of  India  stipulates  that  companies  listed  on  the  domestic  \nbourses  must  have  at  least  50%  independent  directors  on  their  board.

In  2005,  NTPC  was  awarded  the  Golden  Peacock  Global  Award  for  Excellence  in \nCorporate Governance in the Public Sector Units category by the World Council for Corporate \nGovernance.24  NTPC  was  declared  the  winner  of  this  award  by  a  jury  headed  by  Ola  Ullsten, \nformer prime minister of Sweden, in addition to other luminaries. \n \nD. \n \nNTPC maintains a BB+ long-term issuer default credit rating by Fitch and S&P; a rating \n30. \nequivalent  to  the  sovereign  rating  of  India.  Despite  the  AAA  local  credit  rating,  NTPC  is \nconstrained  by  the  sovereign  rating  of  BB+  as  a  majority  Government-owned  company.  S&P \nrecently  upgraded  its  outlook  for  the  sovereign  and  NTPC  to  \u201cpositive\u201d  based  on  overall  fiscal \nimprovements  in  India.  In  FY2005,  NTPC  generated  Rs232  billion  ($5.2  billion)  in  revenues, \nRs66 billon ($1.5 billion) in operating profit, and Rs58 billion ($1.3 billion) in net profit after tax. \nRevenue growth is principally driven by capacity additions and tariffs. Revenue surged 16.9% in \nFY2005  with  the  commissioning  of  2,000  MW  of  new  capacity.  Despite  an  ambitious  capital \nexpansion  plan,  NTPC  has  strong  coverage  ratios\u2014net  debt/earnings  before  interest,  taxes, \ndepreciation,  and  amortization;  debt  service  coverage;  and  interest  coverage  ratios  were  3.1; \n4.8; and 9.5 respectively for the estimated accounts ending March 2006,25 supported by strong \ncash flows. Its total liabilities to net worth of 0.73 (i.e., 42:58), indicates that the company is not \nsignificantly  leveraged,  and  headroom  for  long-term  borrowings  to  match  capital  expansion \nplans is sufficient. While 28% of its debt is denominated in foreign currencies, foreign exchange \nrisk  is  minimal  as  any  related  losses  on  debt  service  payments  can  be  passed  through  in  the \ntariffs  as  permitted  by  the  regulator.  While  budgeted  capital  expenditures  will  exert  some \npressure on NTPC\u2019s credit ratios, cash flows from new facilities should keep coverage ratios at \nsufficient levels. Appendix 3 provides more detailed financial information. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe NTPC generation capacity expansion program currently appears to be on schedule \nwith 2,000 MW being commissioned in FY2005 and an additional 500 MW in FY2006. NTPC is \nforecasting  to  commission  a  total  of  3,710  MW  in  the  current  fiscal  year.  Based  on  these \nprojections, nearly 9,160 MW will be added by NTPC by the end of the 10th Plan. NTPC intends \nto double capacity to 46,461 MW at an estimated cost of Rs700 billion ($15.5 billion) by the end \nof FY2012 (i.e., end of the 11th Plan). This equates to annual average expenditures of Rs117 \nbillion  ($2.6  billion).  A  schedule  of  existing  and  planned  expansion  projects  is  attached  as \nAppendix 4. \n \n32. \nNTPC has developed a financing strategy based in part on CERC\u2019s tariff order. The tariff \norder  dictates  the  extent  to  which  the  cost  of  financing  NTPC\u2019s  ongoing  projects  can  be \nrecovered from the bulk tariffs. As indicated in the 2004 order,26 all projects should be financed \nby a debt to equity ratio of 70:30.27 NTPC\u2019s internal cash generation from operations is sufficient \n                                                 \n24   Information available at http://www.wcfcg.net \n25   As of 30 May 2006, NTPC\u2019s audited financial results for FY2006, ending 31 March 2006, are not yet available. \n26   CERC. 2004. Terms and Conditions for Tariff Period 2004\u20132009. New Delhi. \n27   This  specified  ratio  indicates  that  the  equity  component  should  not  be  greater  than  30%  of  total  capital,  as  this \n\nCapital Expenditure and Financing Plan \n\nwould increase the weighted average cost of capital to be recovered from the tariff. \n\n\f 11 \n\nto  fund  such  equity  requirements  for  its  proposed  new  projects.  Under  the  tariff  norms,  equity \nearns  a  maximum  rate  of  return  ceiling  of  14%,  paid  through  the  tariff.  With  annual  average \nproposed  expenditures  of  $2.6  billion  equivalent  per  annum,  NTPC  must  raise  approximately \n$1.8 billion in debt each year. NTPC is not permitted under the external commercial borrowing \nguidelines of the Reserve Bank of India to borrow more than $500 million equivalent each year \nfrom  foreign  sources.  This  means  that  to  optimize  NTPC\u2019s  project  financing  program,  nearly \n$1.3  billion  equivalent  of  debt  must  be  raised  in  rupees  through  local  financial  institutions, \nbanks, and the bond market. As Indian financial institutions have single borrower limits of 15% \nof net own funds, NTPC has determined that limited headroom is available in the next several \nyears  to  continue  borrowing  from  these  banks  and  financial  institutions.  By  process  of \nelimination,  this  leaves  rupee  bond  issues  and  external  commercial  borrowings  as  the  key \nsources  of  financing  for  future  projects.  Based  on  this  analysis,  NTPC\u2019s  long-term  corporate \ndebt  strategy  is  to  borrow  external  bank-sourced  debt  on  an  unsecured  basis,  and  to \ncomplement  such  borrowings  to  the  maximum  practical  extent  with  rupee  bond  issues,  which \nmust, as required by the Companies Act, be secured against NTPC\u2019s assets.28  \n \nF. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nSOE  Lending  under  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments \n\n \n33. \nAs  outlined  in  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and \nModalities  (footnote  1),  numerous  SOEs  are  creditworthy  and  have  the  long-term  financial \nviability  to  borrow  without  government  guarantees.  They  constitute  a  \u201cthird  generation\u201d29  of \npotential borrowers, and are increasingly important as SOEs operate rather independently from \nthe  sovereign.  These  entities  play  an  important  role  in  creating  employment  and  providing \ninfrastructure  and  basic  public  services.  Giving  them  access  to  affordable  long-term  credit  is \ncritical  to  promoting  economic  growth.  Since  1997,  NTPC  has  been  borrowing  without \nGovernment  assistance  from  external  commercial  financial  sources.  ADB\u2019s  objective  in \nprocessing  this  transaction  is  to  lend  and  to  facilitate  cofinancing,  in  each  case  without \ngovernment guarantee to NTPC so as to ensure that power generation can be expanded at a \nleast cost to the economy and the recovery of the power sector can be sustained.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSupporting NTPC\u2019s Reform Program \n\n \n34. \nADB  lending  to  a  state-owned  enterprise  should  be  accompanied  by  corporate  and/or \nsector  reforms  (footnote  1).  As  described  in  para.  26,  NTPC  has  in  the  past  voluntarily \nundertaken  numerous  corporate  governance  reforms  to  improve  performance,  transparency, \nand efficiency; and is currently seen as a governance model for other SOEs in India. \n \nIn support of its corporate governance reforms, NTPC passed a formal antifraud policy \n35. \non 29 March 2006. Over the years, NTPC has put in place various policies and procedures to \nguide  its  employees  to  ensure  that  officials  dealing  with  and  undertaking  transactions  conduct \nthemselves  in  a  transparent  and  uniform  manner.  These  procedures  include  delegation  of \nfinancial  and  administrative  powers;  project  and  contracts  management  systems;  finance  and \nhuman  resources;  code  of  conduct  for  directors  and  senior  management;  and  conduct, \ndiscipline, and appeal rules for employees. NTPC was one of the first SOEs to appoint a chief \n\n                                                 \n28   Under Section 125 of the Companies Act, bonds must be secured by 125% of their value against issuer\u2019s assets. \n29   The  first  generation  of  clients  is  the  sovereign  states  and  the  second  generation  comprises  private  sector \n\ncompanies. SOEs lie somewhere in between the two, forming a distinct group or third generation. \n\n \n\n\f12   \n \n\n \n\nvigilance  officer.  This  officer  reports  directly  to  the  board  chair  and  maintains  a  full  fledged \ninvestigation unit at headquarters and at each project site. This group has been operational in \nNTPC  since  1985.  In  addition,  a  more  explicit  policy  was  formulated  to  formalize  and \nconsolidate  these  policies.  This  will  include  a  whistle  blower  policy,  under  which  employees \n(confidentially, if so desired) can report to management unethical behavior, actual or suspected \nfraud,  or  violation  of  conduct  or  ethics  policy.  This  policy  will  also  apply  to  NTPC\u2019s  suppliers, \ncontractors,  consultants,  and  service  providers  doing  any  type  of  business  with  NTPC.  The \nresponsibility for fraud prevention will rest with the individual to ensure that no fraudulent activity \nis  being  committed  in  their  areas  of  responsibility/control.  NTPC  has  been  instituting  these \ncorporate  reforms  on  a  continuing  basis.    The  reforms  are  considered  by  ADB  to  constitute \nvaluable steps toward good governance that should be emulated by others.  \n \nIn addition, NTPC is voluntarily undertaking other reforms in its operations with respect \n36. \nto  operational  efficiency  and  environmental  improvements.  One  of  the  loan\u2019s  two  eligible \nprojects,  the  Sipat  Super  Thermal  Power  Project  (Stage  I),  will  utilize  supercritical  boiler \ntechnology  to  improve  the  plant\u2019s  thermal  efficiency  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  \ncompared  with  standard  boiler  equipment.  These  supercritical  boilers  operate  at  higher \ntemperatures  and  pressure  than  traditional  technology.30  Supercritical  coal-fired  power  plants \ncan  achieve  thermal  efficiencies  of  up  to  40%,  compared  with  the  standard  37%  level.  A  1% \nincrease  in efficiency  can  reduce  specific  emissions  (such as  carbon  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides, \nsulfur  oxides,  and  suspended  particulates)  by  approximately  2.6%.31  Sipat  Stage  I  is  the  first \nimplementation  of  supercritical  technology  in  India,  demonstrating  how  thermal  projects  can \nconvert energy resources into electricity more efficiently and more cleanly, while utilizing coal for \nbaseload  power  plants.  NTPC  intends  to  implement  supercritical  technology  throughout  its \nfuture coal-fired projects to improve efficiency, reduce coal consumption, and reduce emissions. \n \n37. \nAs  it  diversifies  its  business  outside  of  thermal  power  generation  and  considers \ndeveloping and operating power projects outside of India, NTPC is voluntarily raising its effluent \ncontrol standards and environmental performance standards despite the fact that its generation \nplants  already  comply  with  India  government  standards.  Specifically  through  the  dialogue  on \nthis  proposed  loan,  NTPC  has  committed  to  raise  its  effluent  discharge  quality  standards  to \nmeet ADB environmental mitigation levels on all new projects.32 In addition, improvements are \nbeing made to environmental performance standards. For example, the suspended particulate \nmatter air emissions limit set by the Central Pollution Control Board of India is 150 micrograms \nper  cubic  meter.  For  its  operations,  NTPC  has  set  its  internal  limits  to  a  lower  level,  100 \nmicrograms  per  cubic  meter.  However,  for  its  new  plants  (including  the  two  projects  to  be \nfinanced  under  this  loan),  it  is  currently  ordering  electrostatic  precipitators33  with  a  design \nparameter well below the ADB emission requirement of 50 micrograms per cubic meter. NTPC \nhas  also  carried  out  a  performance  enhancement  package  for  electrostatic  precipitators  at  its \nexisting  plants,  whereby  the  control  system  was  upgraded  and  the  collection  surface  area \nincreased.  As  a  result  of  these  efforts,  particulate  emissions  have  been  reduced  by \napproximately  50%.  These  examples  demonstrate  NTPC\u2019s  appreciation  of  environmental \nmitigation efforts and its voluntary reform program above and beyond what is required by Indian \n\n                                                 \n30   Due to higher thermal efficiency, supercritical plants have lower heat rates, lower specific fuel consumption, and \nreduced emissions. Further, supercritical units have other efficiency advantages such as faster startup times, load \nchanges, and higher adaptability for sliding pressure operations and fuel quality variation. \n\n31   NTPC data. \n32   Regarding  environmental  performance  and  emissions,  ADB  follows  the  standards  and  approaches  laid  out  in \n\nWorld Bank. 1999.

Tranche A from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  will  carry  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  a  margin  determined  by  ADB's  Interest  Rate  Committee.  Similarly, \nADB\u2019s  Interest  Rate  Committee  will  determine  the  up-front  and  commitment  fees.  Tranche  B, \nloaned  by  ADB  as  lender  of  record  under  its  CFS  program,  will  be  syndicated  to  commercial \nbanks by the lead CFS arranger, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin to be determined by \nthe commercial market during syndication. \n \n39. \nNTPC, as the borrower of the loan, is responsible for the development, construction, and \noperation  of  its  power  generation  projects.  Proceeds  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be  applied  to \neligible  capital  expenditures  and  civil  works  for  its  power  generation  projects,  including  (i)  the \n2,980  MW  Sipat  Super  Thermal  Power  Plant  Project  (Stages  I  and  II)  located  in  Bilaspur, \nChhattisgarh state; and (ii) the 1,500 MW Kahalgaon Thermal Power Plant Project (Stage II) in \nBhagalpur, Bihar state. A summary description of these two projects is provided in Appendix 5. \n \nB. \n \nThe loan proceeds will finance eligible goods and services procured from ADB\u2019s member \n40. \ncountries for NTPC\u2019s generation expansion projects, including the two projects cited (para 39). \nThe loan documentation will include financial covenants as well as covenants relating to ADB\u2019s \npolicies.  ADB  will  also  enter  into  a  participation  agreement  with  Bank  of  America,  which  will \narrange  the  CFS  tranche  on  an  underwritten  basis.  Bank  of  America  intends  to  syndicate  this \ntranche  after  Board  approval.  Based  on  market  analysis,  commercial  banks  are  sufficiently \ninterested  in  participating  in  this  transaction  at  the  terms  initially  discussed.  ADB  will  take  no \nrisk, financing, repayment, or otherwise, on tranche B.  \n \n41.  \nTypical infrastructure projects processed under nonsovereign operations policies seek to \nobtain project financing on a limited or nonrecourse financing basis by providing lenders with the \nbenefit  of  security  over  all  financial  and  physical  assets  of  the  proposed  project.  Such  a \nfinancing  arrangement  is  the  established  means  by  which  a  start-up  company  or  a  special \npurpose company established by equity investors34 obtains project financing for which a suitable \nfinancial  return  has  been  projected.  In  contrast  to  such  a  project  financing  structure,  the \nrepayment and other obligations under the proposed loan will not be borne by a special purpose \nvehicle,  but  instead,  by  NTPC,  being  a  creditworthy  borrower.  The  loan  will  not  be  secured \nagainst specific assets of NTPC. In the event of a default, ADB will have the right to accelerate \nthe  loan  and  seek  repayment  from  NTPC\u2019s  internal  cash  generation  rather  than  enforcing \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n                                                 \n34   Private  sector  projects  typically  are  structured  around  a  loan  to  a  special  purpose  vehicle  with  few  assets  other \nthan a concession or a license. The loan is secured by collateral comprising the physical assets of the project and \nthe contractual entitlements of the borrower.  \n\n \n\n\f14   \n \n\n \n\nsecurity  over  specific  assets.  As  an  unsecured  indebtedness,  ADB\u2019s  loan  would  (i)  be \nsubordinated to all secured debt (as of 31 March 2005, Rs44,407 million or $986.8 million), and \n(ii) rank pari passu with NTPC\u2019s existing unsecured debt (Rs126,471 million or $2,810 million) \nand  its  future  unsecured  debt.  While  the  loan  would  also  be  subordinate  to  all  future  secured \ndebt,  ADB  will  limit  the  extent  of  such  secured  liabilities  to  an  acceptable  level  by  means  of \nobtaining from NTPC the benefit of a negative pledge covenant in the loan agreement.  \n \n42. \nNTPC  has  requested  a  loan  structure  in  which  the  blended  terms  of  the  two  tranches \nprovide  long-term  funding  (para  38).  Whereas  the  syndicated  commercial  bank  market  is \nconstrained to offering maximum 5 year tenors (exception to 7 years), the ADB-funded tranche \nA  is  proposed  to  have  a  longer  average  life  than  tranche  B  (i.e.,  tranche  A  will  mature  after \ntranche  B).  This  difference  in  repayment  maturities  has  been  appropriately  priced  based  on \nmarket  norms  and  creates  no  seniority  of  one  tranche  to  the  other.  ADB  will  ensure  that  its \nrights  to  accelerate  and  enforce  its  debt  will  be  triggered  under  cross-default  provisions. \nAlternative loan structures (e.g., structures under which NTPC would benefit from some form of \nADB  credit  enhancement)  have  been  considered.  However,  NTPC  has  indicated  its  strong \npreference for the proposed loan structure since it provides the lowest all-in cost of borrowing. \nAt the same time, it enables ADB to facilitate through its CFS program a substantial tranche of \nthe syndicated bank market debt at optimal market terms. \n  \n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nJustification for Asian Development Bank Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n43. \nattached as Appendix 6. The loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n\nA  proposed  framework  for  assessing  the  development  effectiveness  of  the  loan  is \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTo  reduce  current  peak  demand  and  energy  deficits  and  sustain  economic \ngrowth of approximately 8% per annum, India needs to add substantial amounts \nof  power  generation  capacity.  India  also  needs  to  diversify  its  mix  of  energy \nresources  for  power  generation  to  reduce  its  dependence  on  coal.  The \nGovernment  has  committed  to  add  nearly  100,000  MW  of  thermal,  hydro,  and \nrenewable  power  generation  capacity  before  the  end  of  the  11th  Plan.  NTPC\u2019s \nability  to  develop,  finance,  construct,  and  commission  new  plants  is  integral  to \nthe Government\u2019s economic development plans. The proposed loan will partially \nfinance foreign exchange expenditures for two large generation projects, adding \n4,480 MW to the regional grids between 2006 and 2008.  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  help  NTPC  finance  a  project  that  is  introducing \nsupercritical  steam  technology  (footnote  30)  into  power  generation  plants  in \nIndia;  this  technology  improves  thermal  efficiency  by  up  to  5%  and  reduces  air \nemissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides by 2.6% for \neach percentage increase in thermal efficiency. ADB\u2019s financing will be applied to \nthe first supercritical project being implemented in India. \n\nThe  proposed  loan  helps  improve  the  country\u2019s  environmental  standards  by \nsupporting the dominant electric utility (27% of total energy produced in FY2005) \nin upgrading and improving its own environmental standards. For the two eligible \npower generation projects under the loan, NTPC has agreed to adhere to ADB\u2019s \nair  emissions  standards.  In  addition,  during  the  course  of  loan  processing  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 15 \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\ndue diligence, NTPC has committed to improve  its effluent discharge standards \nfor all new power generation projects to be in line with ADB standards.  \n\nThrough  the  use  of  its  CFS  facility,  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  catalyze  $225  million  of \ncommercial  cofinancing,  which  both  strengthens  NTPC\u2019s  relationship  with \ninternational  commercial  banks,  and  through  a  3-to-1  leveraging  of  ADB  funds, \nreduces ADB\u2019s overall exposure in the transaction.  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  helps  NTPC  more  closely  match  its  liabilities  to  the  cost-\nrecovery formula dictated by  CERC\u2019s tariff order. NTPC is the largest electricity \ngenerator  in  India;  any  financial  mismatch  (e.g.,  shorter  tenors  that  would \ntypically  be  offered  via  standard  corporate  borrowings),  could  put  pressure  on \nbulk  power  and  ultimately  retail  tariffs,  which  could  undermine  the  sector's \nfinancial  recovery  and  stall  further  reforms.  The  syndicated  commercial  bank \nmarket does not provide offshore US dollar financing beyond 5-year tenors (and \non an exceptional basis, up to 7 years) in India. However, ADB has the ability to \nlend long-term funds  where, as in the present case, it can have a development \nimpact. \n\nADB\u2019s CSP update for India (2006\u20132008) confirms ADB\u2019s support for the power \nsector  in  India,  specifically  through  national  interventions  and  development  of \nmore  efficient,  low-carbon  power  generation  through  agencies  such  as  NTPC. \nThe  financing  supports  the  focus  on  strengthening  good  governance  in  public \nsector organizations to optimize the development impact of physical investments. \nThe CSP update currently being prepared for 2007\u20132009 underscores the need \nfor ADB to focus its assistance on Navratna companies such as NTPC. \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  consistent  with  the  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative  to \nprovide nonsovereign financing to creditworthy state-owned enterprises (footnote \n1).  NTPC  is  one  of  the  Navratna  companies  in  India  that  operate  with \nmanagerial, operational, and financial autonomy from the Government; and has \nimplemented  corporate  and  operational  reforms  to  improve  its  transparency, \nperformance, and efficiency. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\n \nB. \n \nThis  intervention  is  classified  as  equivalent  to  environmental  category  FI.  Further  to  this \n44. \nclassification,  NTPC\u2019s  corporate  environment  policy  and  environmental  management  systems, \nalong with the plant-specific environmental management system, was reviewed. A summary of \nADB\u2019s  assessment  is  attached  as  Appendix  7  and  the  full  assessment  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  B.  In  November  1995,  NTPC  became  the  first  Indian  public  utility  to  bring  out  a \ncomprehensive  environmental  management  document:  NTPC  Environment  Policy  and \nEnvironment Management System. Among the guiding principles adopted in the document are \nthe  company's  proactive  approach  to  the  environment,  optimum  utilization  of  equipment, \nadoption  of  latest  technologies,  and  continual  environmental  improvement.  The  policy  also \nenvisages efficient utilization of resources, thereby minimizing waste, maximizing ash utilization, \nand providing a greenbelt (i.e., afforestation program) around the plant perimeter for maintaining \necological balance. NTPC has established an environmental management system as per ISO-\n14001 certification at each power generation plant. As a result of pursuing sound environmental \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16   \n \n\n \n\nmanagement  practices,  all  NTPC  power  stations,35  as  well  as  the  corporate  environment \nmanagement  and  ash  utilization  division,  are  already  certified  as  ISO-14001  compliant  by \ncertifying agencies. ADB identified some minor areas for further improvement in the environment \npolicy and environmental management systems, and NTPC has indicated its intent to implement \nsuch recommendations.  \n \n45. \nIn  view  of  the  proceeds  of  the  financing  being  applied  to  two  specific  projects  (each \nclassified  as  environmental  category  A),  the  environmental  impact  assessment  for  each  project \nwas  prepared  and  reviewed,  site  visits  undertaken,  and  a  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment (Supplementary Appendix A) of both projects circulated to ADB\u2019s Board and posted \non ADB\u2019s website on 29 March 2006.  \n \nThe main adverse environmental impacts of the projects will be a marginal decline in air \n46. \nquality and ash and effluent production. The decline in ambient air quality is minor due to (i) the \nuse of coal with a sulfur content of around 0.36% for Sipat and 0.40% for Kahalgaon; (ii) use of \na  two-stage  combustion  process  that  reduces  the  formation  of  thermal  nitrogen  oxides  in  the \nfurnace; (iii) trapping more than 99.9% of fly ash in high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators to \nlimit particulate emissions to less than 50 mg/Nm3, in line with ADB limits; and (iv) installing 275 \nmeter high stacks that promote higher mixing.36 About 40% of the ash produced as a by-product \nof combustion over the initial 9 years of plant operation will be utilized, with 100% of ash to be \nutilized  beyond  this  period.  The  main  uses  will  be  fly-ash-based  Portland  Pozzolana  cement \nmanufacturing, clay fly-ash brick manufacturing, road and embankment construction, agriculture \nand  wasteland  development,  and  mine  filling.  Effluent  from  plant  processes  will  be  reused  or \ntreated to ADB standards before discharge. Other major impact mitigation measures include a \ncoal dust suppression system and an extensive greenbelt program. \n \n47. \nNTPC  and  relevant  local  authorities  will  regularly  monitor  environmental  features  that \nrelate to the main project impacts to check their compliance with project approval conditions and \npollution  standards.  NTPC  will  submit  periodic  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  on  environmental \nperformance.  The  principal  parameters  to  be  monitored  will  be  local  meteorology,  flue  gas \nemissions,  local  ambient  air  quality,  surface  water  and  groundwater  quality,  discharge  effluent \nquality, soils, aquatic ecology, and noise levels. \n \n48. \nResettlement and indigenous people\u2019s aspects in relation to the projects have also been \nassessed,  and  in  view  of  the  fact  that  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  has  already  been \nsatisfactorily completed in each location, a category C was assigned to both projects. The review \nwas  inclusive  of  the  associated  components  such  as  access  roads,  water  pipelines,  reservoirs, \ncoal transport system, ash dykes, and transmission lines for evacuation of power. The land for the \nphysical construction work involved in the Kahalgaon Project was acquired in 198537 and Sipat \nin 2000 as per the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. As the land was acquired over 20 years ago, the \ncompensation  and  resettlement  activities  at  Kahalgaon  have  been  completed.  All  affected \nhouseholds were compensated as per the Land Acquisition Act. A comprehensive resettlement \n                                                 \n35  Excluding Simhadri, which was recently commissioned and currently seeking certification. \n36  The  Sipat  and  Kahalgaon  ambient  air  quality  is  classified  under  World  Bank  guidelines  as  poor  due  mainly  to \nvehicle movements on unsealed roads, agricultural disturbance of soil, and domestic activities. As such, emissions \nfrom  the  two  plants  will  have  a  negligible  impact  on  overall  ambient  air  quality.  While  the  suspended  particulate \nmatter  and  nitrous  oxide  limits  will  be  met  for  both  plants,  there  are  minor  deviations  with  regard  to  sulfur  oxide \nemissions  (5%  for  Sipat,  14%  for  Kahalgaon).  Mitigation  measures  to  reduce  total  daily  weight  of  sulfur  oxide \nemissions  to  meet  the  guidelines  were  considered  but  determined  to  be  cost  ineffective  for  the  small  reduction \nsought. Additional information is contained in the summary environmental impact assessment.   \n\n37  As the Kahalgaon stage II Project is an extension of an existing site, all land was acquired in 1985 when the first \n\nplant was constructed. \n\n\f 17 \n\nand  rehabilitation  plan  for  Sipat  was  prepared  as  per  the  NTPC  policy  on  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation and is presently under implementation.38 During the due diligence, ADB met with \nthe district magistrates to confirm the status of compensation payments. \n \nNTPC\u2019s policy provides for adequate rehabilitation and resettlement options and facilities \n49. \nto  those  affected;  those  affected  by  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  proceedings  were  provided  with \ncompensation  and  assistance  along  with  rehabilitation  programs,  which  are  still  ongoing  in \nmany  of  the  villages  around  Sipat.  NTPC  has  institutionalized  the  resettlement  agenda  by \nhaving its own corporate policy, with full time staff exclusively responsible for implementation of \nresettlement and rehabilitation plans. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n \nNTPC  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  anticorruption39  and  the  combating  of  money \n50. \nlaundering  and  financing  of  terrorism.40  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  NTPC  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose of \npreventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant \nwith  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  Further  information  on  NTPC\u2019s  own \nanticorruption efforts is described in para. 35. \n \nD. \n \n51. \n \n\nThe main risks of the transaction and its mitigation measures are as follows: \n\nMain Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nNTPC  credit  risk.  NTPC\u2019s  current  financial  position  is  quite  strong,  with \nsustained  operating  margins  and  cash  flow,  low  levels  of  debt,  and  strong \ncoverage  ratios  to  adequately  service  and  repay  the  proposed  loan.  Given \nNTPC\u2019s large capital expansion program, cash outflows should continue to grow \nand  debt  levels  will  rise  over  the  medium  term.  As  new  capacity  comes  online, \nrevenues  will  strengthen  to  offset  some  of  the  additional  pressures  of  capital \ninvestments  and  rising  debt  service.  NTPC\u2019s  coverage  ratios  will  gradually \ndecline  as  more  debt  is  borrowed,  but  the  projected  ratios  maintain  sufficient \nlevels throughout the loan period. Stress tests of key variables (including foreign \nexchange exposure, delays in project commissioning, fuel prices, interest rates, \netc.) have been carried out, and indicate no significant threats to NTPC\u2019s ability \nto  service  its  existing  and  future  debt.  To  the  extent  cash  flows  do  come  under \nsome  pressure,  NTPC  will  most  likely  defer  certain  projects  or  raise  additional \nresources through sale of its short-term securities and investments.  \n\nSEB  counterparty/credit  risk.  Retail  distribution  of  electricity  in  India  is \nessentially handled by the state electricity units, and all generators are exposed \nto this credit risk. While the tripartite agreement settlement has resolved the past \ndue receivables and provided incentives for the improvement of current dues of \n\n                                                 \n38  Land  acquisition  of  1,510  hectares  was  completed  between  1997  and  1999,  55%  of  which  was  barren \nGovernment-owned land. The land required (243 hectares) for the coal transport system was acquired in 2003 and \n2004. \n\n39  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n40  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \n\nTerrorism. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f18   \n \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\nthe SEBs, residual risk remains as many SEBs are still loss-making although to a \nlesser extent. However, relative to other utilities, these risks are lower for NTPC \nbecause  of  its  dominant  position  in  electricity  supply  (being  the  lowest  cost \nproducer, it is a preferred supplier by distributors) and the ability to cut off power \nsupply  for  nonpayment  (as  empowered  in  the  tripartite  agreement)  has  helped \nsecure  payments.  Further,  NTPC\u2019s  ownership  of  generation  stations  across  all \nregions  of  India  helps  it  diversify  its  customer  base  and  exposure  to  all  the \nregional power markets, blending the risks of poor SEBs with the stronger ones.  \n\nTariff  and  regulatory  risk.  CERC,  which  sets  tariffs  for  NTPC\u2019s  plants,  issued \nthe most recent tariff order in 2004. India follows a cost-plus-tariff structure, with \nall  debt  servicing,  foreign  exchange  losses,  operation,  and  maintenance \n(including fuel costs) passed through in the tariffs. In addition, NTPC is allowed to \nearn a maximum 14% return on its equity funding (capped at 30% of total project \ncosts).  The  recovery  of  NTPC\u2019s  operating  costs  is  tied  to  it  meeting  minimum \navailability requirements set by CERC, with incentives for exceeding these levels. \nNTPC  regularly  meets  and  exceeds  these  operational  targets.  While  the  2004 \ntariff order presents an amortization challenge for NTPC, the tariffs for each plant \nare set to ensure the costs of production and financing are fully covered. ADB\u2019s \nloan to NTPC will be made in US dollars and any foreign exchange risk can be \npassed through in the tariffs. \n\nSector  reform  risk.  The  Electricity  Act  put  in  place  a  framework  for  reforms  in \nthe sector, but in several areas the details and timing are yet to be finalized by \nthe  relevant  authorities.  Under  the  Electricity  Act,  the  SEBs  are  required  to \nunbundle their operations into separate generation, transmission, and distribution \ncompanies. A transition period is likely required to allow these changes to be put \ninto  effect.  As  India  is  likely  to  be  a  power  deficient  country  in  the  intermediate \nterm,  development  of  a  more  competitive  spot  or  pool  market  is  unlikely.  Once \nunbundled,  NTPC\u2019s  power  purchase  agreements  with  the  SEBs  will  be \nreallocated  to  the  new  entities,  which  may  or  may  not  have  credit  standing \nequivalent  to  their  predecessors.  This  could  affect  their  ability  to  make  timely \npayments  to  NTPC.  At  the  same  time,  these  companies  are  unlikely  to  be \nunbundled without the accompanying reforms to the fundamental tariff structure \nto  allow  recovery  of  costs  by  the  individual  units.  Furthermore  the  tariff  policy \nissued by CEA in early 2006 indicates that all power purchase agreements must \nbe  backed  by  adequate  and  bankable  payment  security  mechanisms.  In  of  the \nevent that such arrangements prove unacceptable to NTPC, it has the option to \nsell the power to other buyers with better credit. NTPC is the dominant supplier of \ninexpensive base-load power to the SEBs, so this will mitigate the risk that power \nis either not purchased by the new entities or that payment risk will increase as a \nresult of sector reform. \n\n(v) \n\nFuel supply risk. As coal dominates NTPC\u2019s fuel mix, it also represents a risk to \nNTPC\u2019s operations in terms of supply and price. NTPC\u2019s fuel risks are essentially \nmitigated  by  India\u2019s  substantial  coal  reserves  (230  times  production  levels  in \n2003), which limit its dependence on imported coal. The Government continues \nto  manage  domestic  fuel  supply  and  delink  domestic  and  international  energy \nprices.  Coal  from  state-owned  coal  companies  met  97%  of  NTPC  demand  in \nFY2005 and imports helped fill the gap. NTPC is currently investing directly into \nthe coal mine business to reduce supply risk and to put competitive pressure on \n\n\f 19 \n\n(vi) \n\nprice  negotiations  with  existing  suppliers.  Even  if  fuel  prices  rise  by  a  small \npercentage each year, margins should not be affected as any price increases are \npassed  through  in  the  tariffs.  While  NTPC\u2019s  gas  plants  have  worked  below  full \ncapacity  due  to  receiving  only  80%  of  the  gas  supply  required,  the  same  has \nbeen  true  for  all  of  NTPC\u2019s  competitors.  NTPC  is  in  the  process  of  negotiating \nwith new gas suppliers to bridge the gap. As gas-fired plants only comprise 17% \nof NTPC\u2019s existing capacity, gas supply and price risks will not have a substantial \nimpact on operations. \n\nloan \n\nthe  proposed \n\nSubordination  risk.  As \nis  unsecured,  ADB  will  be \nsubordinated to NTPC\u2019s secured creditors. However, as of 31 March 2005, only \n26%  of  NTPC\u2019s  total  long-term  liabilities  were  secured  and  comprised  solely  of \nrupee  bonds  and  one  loan  from  the  World  Bank.41  This  totals  Rs44,407  million \n($986.8  million)  in  secured  liabilities  against  NTPC\u2019s  net  fixed  assets  of \nRs322,433 ($7.2 billion).42 Per its corporate debt financing strategy, NTPC does \nnot  secure  its  external  and  domestic  borrowings  other  than  required  by  law  for \nrupee bond issues. All external commercial borrowings have been made from the \ninternational bank market on a negative pledge basis, except for a loan extended \nby  the  World  Bank  in  1993.  Approximately  $4.4  billion  has  been  raised  without \ncreating a charge on fixed assets. Further, all rupee loan agreements executed \nwith  Indian  lenders  are  unsecured.  Therefore,  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  rank  pari  passu \nwith  NTPC\u2019s  existing  and  future  unsecured  creditors.  In  the  event  of  such \nnonpayment, ADB may have somewhat restricted rights of recovery through legal \nor  arbitral  processes.  ADB  believes  however  that  its  existing  relationship  with \nNTPC43 and ADB\u2019s lending program to the power sector will assist it in ensuring \nthat  it  is  not  deprived  of  its  pari  passu  ranking  shared  with  other  unsecured \ncreditors.  \n\nVII. \n\nEXPOSURE LIMITS \n\n \n52. \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  exposure  of  $75  million  to  NTPC  will  be  ADB\u2019s  19th \nnonsovereign investment in India, and the first loan to a state-owned enterprise in India without \nsovereign  guarantee  under  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities  (footnote  1).  It  will, \nonce  approved,  represent  4.2%  of  ADB\u2019s  aggregate  nonsovereign  exposure  and  increase  its \nnonsovereign  investment  in  the  thermal  power  sector  from  27.6%  of  its  total  exposure  to \n30.6%.44  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n41   A  loan  of  $400  million  made  by  the  World  Bank  in  December  1993  to  specifically  finance  construction  of  the \nRihand  Super  Thermal  Power  Plant  is  secured  against  these  fixed  assets.  This  loan  is  guaranteed  by  the \nGovernment of India. \n\n42   This  is  the  book  value  of  net  fixed  assets,  not  necessarily  the  market  and/or  salvage  value  of  these  assets.  In \naddition, it excludes the value of NTPC investments and other current assets, which are liquid assets. Therefore, \nthis is a very conservative estimate of NTPC\u2019s available assets should security need to be enforced in the event of \nnonliquidity. \n\n43   ADB. 1988.

Although \npower generation capacity increased substantially in recent years, it has not kept pace with the \ngrowth  in  demand  or  the  growth  of  the  economy  generally.  According  to  the  United  Nations, \nIndia  has  one  of  the  lowest  electricity  consumption  levels  in  the  world,  at  569  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) per capita in 2002, due in part to unreliable supply and inadequate distribution networks. \nThis  contrasts  with  1,484  kWh  per  capita  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  2,183  kWh  per \ncapita in Brazil, and 13,456 kWh per capita in the United States in 2002. \n \n2. \nHistorically,  state  and  central  government  entities  played  the  dominant  roles  in  the \ndevelopment  of  the  Indian  power  industry.  However,  capacity  growth  did  not  keep  pace  with \ndemand  due  to  inadequate  investment  and  the  poor  financial  health  of  the  state  electricity \nboards (SEBs). However, in light of persistent shortages in recent years, the Government has \ntaken  significant  action  to  restructure  the  industry  and  attract  both  public  and  private  sector \ninvestment. This included measures to restructure the SEBs and improve their financial health. \nIn  addition,  the  Government  has  liberalized  policies  relating  to  the  generation  and  distribution \nsectors. \n \nB. \n \nAt the time of independence in 1947, India had power generating capacity of a meager \n3. \n1,362 megawatts (MW). Power was only available in a few urban centers, not in villages or rural \nareas.  Generation  and  distribution  of  power  was  carried  out  primarily  by  private  utility \ncompanies.  By  statute,  the  central  and  state  governments  have  jurisdiction  over  the  power \nsector.  Hence,  the  state  legislatures  have  full  power  to  legislate  regarding  the  power  sector, \nsubject  to  the  power  provision  that  the  state  enactment  does  not  conflict  with  any  central \nenactment in the sector. The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, of India (the Supply Act) created the \ninstitutional  framework  under  which  the  industry  was  developed;  this  framework  was  not \nsubstantially modified until the recent passage of the Electricity Act. The Supply Act led to the \ncreation  of  the  SEBs,  state  government  agencies  with  the  sole  responsibility  for  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  within  each  state.  Most  states  established  SEBs  to \nmanage  and  operate  power  systems;  the  smaller  states  and  Union  territories  established \nelectricity departments. As of 31 March 2005, the SEBs owned or controlled approximately 56% \nof India's total generating capacity and had substantial control of most of the distribution assets. \n \n4. \nThe Ministry of Power (MOP) and the Ministry of Non Conventional Energy Sources of \nthe  Government  are  primarily  responsible  for  the  development  of  the  power  industry  in  the \ncountry.  MOP  is  responsible  for  overseeing  India's  power  industry.  Its  duties  include  sector \nplanning; policy and legislation formulation; monitoring of power project implementation; training \nand  human  resource  development;  and  administration  of  legislation  in  regard  to  thermal  and \nhydropower  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  In  the  mid  1970s,  the  Government \nrecognized  that  relying  solely  on  the  SEBs  for  power  development  was  leading  to  power \nshortages and large interstate imbalances, particularly in light of the uneven distribution of coal \nand  hydroelectric  resources  throughout  the  country.  To  facilitate  a  more  active  central  role,  in \n1975  the  Government  created  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  Limited  (NTPC)  and \nNational Hydro Power Corporation Limited to establish thermal and hydro generating plants and \nto  install  associated  interregional  transmission  systems.  In  the  same  year,  it  established  the \n\n \n\n\f22   \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSummary of Recent Developments \n\nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA) in its present form to develop a uniform national power policy. \nAdditional  power  generating  companies  were  established  later.  These  entities  are  collectively \nreferred to as the central power sector utilities (CPSUs) and are directly accountable to MOP. In \n1992,  the  central  entity  known  today  as  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  (Powergrid) \nwas  established  to  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  interstate  and  interregional  transmission \nsystems.  The  Power  Trading  Corporation  India  Limited  was  formed  in  1999  to  allow  surplus \npower supplies to be efficiently traded to utilities with deficit power supplies. This corporation is \npromoted by NTPC, Powergrid, National Hydro Power Corporation Limited, and Power Finance \nCorporation. \n \n5. \nThrough  successive  5-year  development  plans,  the  Government  implemented  a  major \nexpansion  of  generating  assets.  From  1982,  when  NTPC's  first  project  was  commissioned,  to \nthe end of FY2005, India's total installed capacity increased from 35,781 MW to 118,419 MW, \nrepresenting a compound annual growth rate of 5.3%. In addition, captive generation capacity at \nthe  end  of  FY2004  was  approximately  19,061  MW.  The  transmission  and  distribution  network \nhas been expanded to cover nearly 80% of the country. However, this expansion has not kept \npace with the growing demand for electricity. \n \nC. \n \nTo  supplement  public  sector  investment,  the  Government  took  steps  in  1991  to  attract \n6. \nprivate investment into the power industry. The Government permitted 100% foreign ownership \nof  power  generating  assets  and  provided  assured  returns;  a  5-year  tax  holiday;  low  equity \nrequirements; and for some private generators, counterguarantees against nonpayment of dues \nby the SEBs. However, these reforms still did not address the poor financial health of the SEBs, \nand  power  shortages  persisted.  Transmission  and  distribution  (T&D)  losses  were  especially \nhigh, due to inadequate metering, obsolete equipment, and theft. T&D losses were estimated to \nbe  32.9%  on  average  for  the  country  in  FY2001.  The  commercial  losses  of  the  SEBs  were \nRs206  billion  ($4.7  billion)  in  FY2004.  By  March  2004,  overdue  payments  by  the  SEBs  to  the \nCPSUs, including interest and surcharges, amounted to Rs53 billion ($1.2 billion). \n \n7. \nTo provide incentives for the states to take concrete measures to restructure their power \noperations,  the  Government  introduced  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  Program  in \nFY2001 (later renamed the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program or APDRP) \nas the incentive was linked to the reform process. The APDRP aims to bring down T&D losses \nto  10%  through  various  central,  state,  and  local  initiatives, and  to  improve  the  performance  of \ngenerating stations through renovation and modernization. To improve the financial health of the \nSEBs, the Government implemented the scheme for one-time settlement of outstanding dues, \nwhich settled the outstanding dues of the SEBs payable to the CPSUs, and set up a system to \nfacilitate  the  full  payment  of  subsequent  billings.  The  recently  adopted  Electricity  Act \nconsolidates  all  existing  laws  governing  the  industry,  creates  a  program  for  restructuring  the \nSEBs,  and  introduces  greater  competition  and  access  into  certain  segments  of  the  industry \n(paras. 15\u201316).  \n \nD. \n \n8. \nPower  demand  in  India  has  grown  rapidly  since  the  1980s  as  the  country\u2019s  economic \ngrowth  accelerated  to  an  annual  average  of  5.6%  since  1980.  Under  MOP\u2019s  Power  for  All  by \n2012, target capacity is being expanded to maintain India\u2019s current 8% economic growth rate. \nOf  total  electricity  sold  in  India,  industry  accounts  for  approximately  33%;  agriculture  and \nhouseholds  for  25%  each;  and  businesses,  commercial,  and  other  small  categories  the \n\nSupply and Demand \n\n\fAppendix 1        23 \n\nPower Generation \n\nfor  approximately  68%  of \n\ntotal  power  capacity;  hydroelectric  stations \n\nremaining 17%. Power demand growth has slowed in recent years to approximately 2\u20133%, not \ndue  to  a  lack  of  demand,  but  due  to  inadequate  capacity  and  poor  T&D  infrastructure.  Power \nquality  remains  poor,  marked  by  high  voltage  fluctuations  and  recurring  load  shedding.  India \ncontinues  to  suffer  from  chronic  electricity  shortage,  where  peak  demand  exceeds  supply  by \nover  12%  and  an  energy  deficit  of  7%  was  recorded  between  April  and  September  2005.1  As \nthe  current  10th  Plan  fulfills  only  75%  of  needed  capacity  additions  to  2007,  energy  shortfalls \nwill  persist  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  The  Government  seeks  to  eliminate  this  deficit  by \n2012, which marks the end of the next 5-year plan (the 11th Plan, 2008\u20132012).  \n \nE. \n \n9. \nAs  of  31  March  2005,  India's  power  system  had  an  installed  generating  capacity  of \napproximately  118,419  MW.  Thermal  power  plants  powered  by  coal,  gas,  naphtha,  or  oil \naccounted \nfor \napproximately  26%;  and  others  (including  nuclear  stations,  wind  power,  and  other  renewable \nenergy sources such as biomass) accounted for approximately 6%. The CPSUs accounted for \napproximately  33%  of  total  power  generation  capacity,  state  electricity  utilities  for  56%,  and \nprivate sector companies for 11%. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  adopts  a  system  of  successive  5-year  plans  that  set  out  targets  for \neconomic development in various sectors, including the power sector. Each successive 5-year \nplan  has  increased  power  generation  capacity  addition  targets.  The  9th  Plan  (1998\u20132002) \ntargeted  a  capacity  addition  of  40,245  MW,  of  which  24%  was  to  come  from  hydro  capacity, \n73% from thermal capacity, and the remainder from nuclear capacity. MOP estimates that only \naround 19,251 MW or 48% of the planned capacity addition was added in the aggregate during \nthe 9th Plan. The target for capacity addition has been set at 41,110 MW under the 10th Plan as \nshown  in  Appendix  4.  The  Government  has  set  an  ambitious  target  of  providing  Power  for  All \n2012 during the 10th and 11th plans. Based on CEA\u2019s 16th Electricity Power Survey, India will \nrequire additional capacity creation of nearly 100,000 MW by 2012 to achieve this goal.  \n \n11. \nCapacity utilization in the Indian power sector, as best measured by the plant load factor \n(PLF) of generating plants, is low. However, the PLF for coal-fired plants increased from 63% in \nFY1996 to 75% in FY2005. The PLF varies significantly across ownership segments. Coal-fired \ngenerating plants owned by SEBs operated at an average PLF of around 70% in FY2005, while \nthose owned by private utilities and CPSUs operated at a PLF of 85% and 82%, respectively, \nduring the same period. \n \nF. \n \n12. \nIn India, the T&D system is a three-tier structure comprising regional grids, state grids, \nand distribution networks. The distribution network and the state grids are owned and operated \nby  SEBs  or  state  governments  through  SEBs.  Powergrid  owns  and  operates  most  interstate \ntransmission links. To facilitate the transfer of power between neighboring states, state grids are \ninterconnected to form regional grids. Because peak demand does not occur simultaneously in \nall  states,  situations  may  arise  when  one  state  has  a  surplus  of  power,  while  another  faces  a \ndeficit.  The  regional  grids  facilitate  transfers  of  power  from  a  power  surplus  state  to  a  power \ndeficit state. The grids also facilitate the optimal scheduling of maintenance outages and better \ncoordination  between  the  power  plants.  The  regional  grids  are  to  be  eventually  integrated  to \nform  a  national  grid,  whereby  surplus  power  from  a  region  could  be  transferred  to  a  region \n\nTransmission and Distribution \n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry of Power monthly statistics. \n\n \n\n\f24   \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nfacing  power  deficits,  thereby  facilitating  a  more  optimal  utilization  of  the  national  generating \ncapacity.  \n \n13. \nAt  present,  the  national  grid  has  a  capacity  of  8,500  MW  and  Powergrid  expects  to \nachieve grid capacity of 30,000 MW by FY2010. The T&D system in India is characterized by \nhigh  losses,  ranging  from  24\u201333%  during  FY1997  to  FY2001,  which  includes  theft  as  well  as \ncommercial  losses.  This  compares  with  T&D  losses  of  10\u201315%  in  developed  countries.  T&D \nlosses for the 19 SEBs and eight electricity departments increased from 22% in FY1993 to 30% \nin FY2001. However, in the absence of adequate metering, loss figures have an implicit element \nof inaccuracy. T&D losses were reduced from 34% in FY2002 to 32% in FY2003. \n \n14. \nThe country\u2019s transmission perspective plan for the 10th and 11th plans focuses on the \ncreation of a national grid in a phased manner by adding over 60,000 kilometers of transmission \nnetwork by 2012. Such an integrated grid will evacuate an additional 100,000 MW by 2012 and \ncarry  60%  of  the  power  generated  in  the  country.  The  existing  interregional  power  transfer \ncapacity  is  9,000  MW,  which  is  to  be  enhanced  to  30,000  MW  by  2012  through  system \nupgrading.  For  creation  of  such  a  grid,  an  investment  of  Rs710,000  million  ($15.7  billion)  is \nenvisaged.  Of  this,  Rs500,000  million  is  planned  to  be  mobilized  by  Powergrid  and  the \nremaining Rs210,000 million through private sector participation. \n \nG. \n \n\nPower Sector Reform \n\n1. \n\nThe Electricity Act (2003) \n\n \nIn  2003,  to  enhance  the  scope  of  power  sector  reforms,  promote  competition,  and \n15. \neliminate  the  multiple  legislation  governing  the  electricity  supply  industry,  the  Government \nenacted the Electricity Act. The Electricity Act calls for the eventual unbundling of the SEBs so \nthat  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  are  established  as  separate \ncorporations.  In  addition,  the  Electricity  Act  provides  for  open  access,  whereby  any  generator \nhas  nondiscriminatory  access  to  transmission  lines  or  distribution  systems,  and  permits  the \ncreation  of  alternative  or  parallel  distribution  networks.  However,  these  reforms  are  likely  to \nrequire time to have full effect. Private sector investments are allowed in the transmission sector \nand foreign direct investment in this sector is being encouraged by the Government. In addition, \ndecentralized  distributed  generation  using  nonconventional  sources  of  energy,  such  as  solar \npower and biomass, are being encouraged in the country. \n \nThe Electricity Act includes wide ranging initiatives to (i) liberalize generation and T&D, \n16. \n(ii) identify the causes of and solve the SEB crisis, (iii) upgrade infrastructure, and (iv) improve \ncoordination between the central and state governments in planning and development. Some of \nthe key provisions of the Electricity Act include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\neliminates  the  licensing  requirement  for  generating  stations  (excluding  hydro) \nthat comply with the grid standards as set by CEA; \nspecifies technical standards, grid standards, and safety requirements; \nexempts captive power plants from obtaining licenses and other approvals; \nprovides  state  governments  with  the  flexibility  to  decide  the  sequencing  and \nphasing of SEB restructuring, hence retaining the integrated SEB structure for a \ntransition period; \nrequires  transmission  and  distribution  line  operators  to  provide  nonpreferential \nopen  access  to  any  generator  or  buyer  of  electricity,  subject  only  to  technical \nconsiderations; \n\n\fAppendix 1        25 \n\nfunctions  of \n\nthe  regulatory \n\nintroduces power trading as a distinct industry activity; \nspecifies \nCommission (CERC); \nrequires states to establish their own regulatory commissions; \ncreates separate licensees for transmission, distribution, and supply; \nrequires the metering of all consumers to improve accountability; \nrequires the formulation of a national electricity policy; and \nrequires the formulation of a national tariff policy. \n\nthe  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n \n2. \n\nNational Electricity Policy \n\n \n17. \nUnder  the  Electricity  Act,  the  central  Government  is  required  to  prepare  a  national \nelectricity  policy  (NEP)  in  consultation  with  CEA  and  the  state  governments.  On  12  February \n2005, the Government issued the NEP to (i) provide guidelines to accelerate the development of \nthe  power  sector,  (ii)  supply  electricity  to  all  areas;  and  (iii)  protect  customers'  interests.  The \nNEP  aims  to  provide  access  to  electricity  to  all  villages  and  households  within  5  years.  In \naddition,  the  NEP  seeks  to  meet  power  demand  and  ensure  the  availability  of  electricity  is \nincreased to over 1,000 kWh per capita by 2012. The NEP recommends easier procedures for \nsetting  up  power  plants  that  are  close  to  hydro  and  thermal  power  sources,  and  recommends \nalternative long-term fuel sources such as liquid fuel and nuclear power. The NEP focuses on \nrenovation  and  modernization  techniques  to  achieve  higher  efficiency  levels.  Development  of \ncaptive generation is encouraged, and the NEP recommends the use of spare energy in captive \ngeneration plants with larger requirements. \n \n\n3. \n\nSEB Reform \n\na. \n\nAccelerated Power Development Reform Program \n\n \nTo  improve  the  condition  of  the  SEBs,  the  Government  launched  a  combination  of \n18. \nregulatory and development initiatives. In 2001, the Government initiated the Accelerated Power \nDevelopment Plan to provide financial assistance to the states for undertaking renovation and \nmodernization  programs  for  thermal  and  hydropower  stations,  and  to  strengthen  and  improve \nthe subtransmission and distribution network. The program was renamed the APDRP in 2003. \nThe Government earmarked a total of Rs400 billion for the program during the 10th Plan. The \nprogram includes investment components and incentive components. \n \nUnder  the  investment  component  of  the  APDRP,  the  Government  provides  financial \n19. \nassistance  to  the  states  to  strengthen  and  upgrade  their  subtransmission  and  distribution \nnetworks.  Half  of  the  cost  of  such  projects  (estimated  at  Rs200,000  million  or  $4.4  billion \nequivalent  in  the  10th  Plan)  is  met  by  the  Government  through  concessional  loans,  with  the \nbalance  arranged  by  the  states  as  counterpart  funding  from  financial  institutions.  Nearly  500 \nsubtransmission  and  distribution  SEB  projects  have  been  approved  for  funding  under  this \nprogram.2  For  states  in  the  northeastern  region,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Jammu  and  Kashmir, \nSikkim,  and  Uttaranchal,  the  Government  provides  financial  assistance  for  up  to  100%  of  the \nproject  cost.  Under  the  incentive  component,  MOP  makes  a  grant  to  the  states  of  50%  of  the \nSEB's actual cash-loss reductions year over year. This component was introduced to motivate \nthe SEBs and utilities to reduce their financial losses. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   Additional  investment  details  on  a  state  by  state  basis  are  available  at  http://www.powermin.nic.in  or \n\nhttp://www.apdrp.com.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26   \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nScheme for One-Time Settlement of Outstanding Dues \n\n20. \nThe  growing  SEB  losses  eventually  triggered  Government  intervention  in  April  2002, \nwhen MOP announced a scheme for one-time settlement of outstanding dues aimed at settling \ndebts,  including  those  to  NTPC,  through  tripartite  agreements  (TPAs)  between  MOP,  the \nReserve Bank of India (RBI), and the states. It provides for \n \n\n(i) \n\nsecuritization  of  dues  outstanding  and  40%  of  surcharge/interest  as  of  30 \nSeptember  2001  through  tax-free  bonds  (bearing  a  coupon  of  8.5%  and \nmaturing in various stages, starting from 1 October 2006 until 1 April 2016) to be \nissued by RBI on behalf of each of the state governments to the CPSUs; \n\n(ii) \n\nwaiver of the remaining 60% of surcharge and interest due by the SEBs; and \n\n(iii) \n\nconversion of any previously issued bonds by SEBs into new TPA bonds. \n\nIt also provides for the full payment of all dues after 30 September 2001 through a mechanism \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nrequiring  SEBs  to  open  and  maintain  letters  of  credit  to  CPSUs  equivalent  to \n105% of the average monthly billing for the preceding 12 months; \n\noffering  SEBs  a  one-time  cash  incentive  equal  to  2%  of  the  bond  amounts  for \nopening and maintaining letters of credit securing their payment obligations; \n\nfor  regular  serving  of  the  bonds  between  FY2003  and  FY2007,  offering  SEBs \ncash  incentives  on  the  principal  amount,  equal  to  6%  rebate  in  FY2003,  5%  in \nFY2004, and 4% in each of FY2005 and FY2006; and \n\nallowing CPSUs to take action in the case of failure to make payment of current \ndues within the stipulated 60-day period or failing to maintain the letters of credit. \nAllowable  actions  include  (i)  graded  reductions  in  power  supply;  and  (ii)  if \npayment  defaults  continue  for  more  than  90  days,  recovery  of  payments  from \nRBI  directly.  Any  payments  made  by  RBI  would  then  be  debited  from  the \napplicable state\u2019s  allocation  from  the  central  Government  (accounts  maintained \nat RBI). \n\nThe  March  2003  settlement  was  documented  by  individual  TPAs  between  MOP,  RBI, \n21. \nand  each  state  to  effectively  settle  overdue  payments  owed  by  the  SEBs  and  to  put  in  place \nincentives for future timely payment. The TPAs also contain a series of obligations on the part of \neach state government and its SEB in relation to ongoing power industry reforms, including the \nestablishment  of  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions,  the  metering  of  distribution  feeders, \nand  the  completion  of  tariff  petitions  in  accordance  with  performance  milestones  reviewed  by \nMOP. The SEBs have opened letters of credit as envisaged in the scheme, which has enabled \nfull  realization  of  the  current  billings  in  most  cases.  In  FY2004  and  FY2005,  NTPC  realized \n100%  of  the  amounts  for  power  sold  to  SEBs  as  a  result  of  this  arrangement.  The  state \ngovernments  have  ensured  timely  servicing  of  the  bonds  to  date.  While  progress  of  sector \nreform continues to be slow, these recent legislative changes and the TPA settlement seem to \nhave  put  the  sector  on  the  road  to  recovery  and  curtailed  the  SEBs  financial  problems,  which \nhad  infected  the  sector  as  a  whole.  Once  the  immediate  pressures  of  its  debt  service  were \nalleviated  through  the  TPAs,  the  resulting  improvement  in  the  cash  resources  of  the  SEBs \nstrengthened their capacity to pay on time and improve metering and collection in the interim. \n\n\fAppendix 1        27 \n\nRegulatory Framework \n\n \nH. \n \n22. \nThe central and state governments share responsibility for the development of the power \nindustry.  MOP  is  the  ministry  governing  the  power  sector  in  the  country  and  oversees  the \noperational  performance  of  all  CPSUs.  CEA  advises  MOP  on  electricity  policy  and  technical \nmatters, among others. CERC was constituted under the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, \n1998,  to  regulate  the  tariffs  for  the  CPSUs  and  other  entities  with  interstate  generation  or \ntransmission  operations.  The  act,  which  has  since  been  replaced  by  the  Electricity  Act,  also \nprovided  for  the  formation  of  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions  (SERCs)  to  rationalize \nenergy tariffs and formulate policy within each state. As of 31 March 2005, 24 states had set up \ntheir SERCs. A joint electricity regulatory commission has been established for two more states. \nGeographically,  the  SEBs  are  grouped  into  five  regional  electricity  boards,  which  coordinate \nsystem operations in the respective regional grids including generation schedule, overhaul, and \nintergrid maintenance programs, power transfers, and tariffs. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nTariff Setting for Generators \n\n \n23. \nTariffs  for  state  sector  generators  are  regulated  by  the  SERCs  or  the  respective  state \ngovernments, and those for independent power producers are not regulated. The Electricity Act \nempowers  CERC  to  set  the  tariff  of  generating  companies  owned  or  controlled  by  the \nGovernment  and  other  entities  with  interstate  generation  or  transmission  operations.  CERC \nadvises  the  Government  on  the  formulation  of  the  national  tariff  policy.  The  tariff  policy  is \nintended  to  serve  as  a  guide  in  the  actual  tariff  setting.  CERC  issued  tariff  regulations  for  5 \nyears effective from 1 April 2004. These regulations provide for tariffs consisting of a capacity \ncharge, a variable charge, and an unscheduled interchange charge.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTariff Setting for Consumers \n\n \n24. \nUnder the Electricity Act, the SERCs regulate the tariffs for customers of the SEBs and \nelectricity departments. The act allows state governments to price power for certain customers \nat  subsidized  rates,  but  requires  them  to  fund  the  subsidy  transparently  from  their  respective \nstate  government  budgets.  While  setting  the  consumer  tariffs,  some  states  have  attempted  to \ncross-subsidize  agricultural  and  domestic  tariffs  by  charging  higher  rates  for  industrial  and \ncommercial consumers. Even with cross-subsidization, tariffs have not kept pace with the cost \nof  supply.  The  cost  of  supply  for  distribution  licensees  averaged  Rs3.49  ($0.079)  per  kWh  in \nFY2002, up from Rs1.09 ($0.025) per kWh in FY1989. The increase in the total cost of supply is \nmainly  due  to  the  increase  in  power  purchase  costs  and  continued  theft  and  losses.  The \naverage  tariff  has  not  increased  proportionately  with  the  increase  of  the  cost  of  supply.  The \naverage  revenue  per  unit  was  Rs2.40  ($0.055)  per  kWh  in  FY2002,  leaving  a  gap  of  Rs1.10 \n($0.025)  for  every  kWh  of  power  supplied.  This  has  adversely  affected  most  of  the  SEBs  and \ntheir commercial losses totaled approximately Rs330 billion ($7.5 billion) in FY2002. However, \nthe  Government  has  taken  many  reforms,  including  setting  up  of  SERCs  under  the  Electricity \nAct to set tariffs. The Government also issued a national tariff policy recommending methods in \nwhich subsidies can be reduced. \n\n \n\n\f28     Appendix 2 \n\nDESCRIPTION OF NTPC LIMITED \n\nOverview \n\n \nA. \n \nNTPC  Limited  (formerly  known  as  National  Thermal  Power  Generation  Limited)  is  a \n1. \nGovernment-owned entity with 89.5% of its paid-up capital contributed by the Government and \nthe balance of 10.5% being held with foreign institutional investors, financial institutions, banks, \nand the general public. NTPC is primarily involved in constructing and operating power stations. \nAccording to the annual report of the Ministry of Power (MOP) for fiscal year (FY) 2005, NTPC \nis the largest thermal generating company in India. As of 31 December 2005, the NTPC\u2019s total \ninstalled  capacity  was  24,249  megawatts  (MW),  through  13  coal-fired  power  stations  (19,980 \nMW),  seven  gas-fired  power  stations  (3,955  MW),  and  three  joint  venture  projects  (314  MW). \nNTPC  also  manages  the  operations  of  Badarpur  power  station  (705  MW)  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment. As of 31 December 2005, NTPC's share of the total installed capacity of India was \n19.6%,  and  it  contributed  27.1%  of  the  total  power  generation  during  FY2005.  The  average \nselling  price  of  NTPC's  power  during  FY2005  was  Rs1.52  ($0.035)  per  kilowatt  hour  (kWh), \nwhich is cheaper than many thermal tariffs in India. NTPC supplies power to the state electricity \nboards (SEBs), the electricity departments, unbundled entities of SEBs (together with SEBs and \nelectricity  departments,  the  state  electricity  utilities),  and  Indian  Railways;  with  the  majority  of \nthe generation output being purchased by the state electricity utilities under separate long-term \npower purchase agreements (PPAs). \n \n2. \nNTPC is pursuing expansion of its business activities into hydroelectric generation, coal \nmining,  gas  exploration,  and  participation  in  the  liquefied  natural  gas  value  chain,  which \nsupplements and supports its core power generation activities. In addition to its core business, \nNTPC provides consultancy services to power utilities in both India and internationally. Through \nits  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  NTPC  proposes  to  implement  and  operate  small-  to  medium-\nsized hydroelectric power plants and engage in power trading and power distribution. It is also \ninvolved in a number of joint ventures, including a joint venture with Alstom, Germany, for the \nrenovation and modernization of third party power plants in India and other member countries of \nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nPrior  to  the  establishment  of  NTPC,  power  generation  and  capacity  augmentation  in \nIndia was largely the responsibility of SEBs. The gap between the demand for electricity and the \nability of SEBs to supply it was perceived by the Government as a significant factor affecting the \neconomic  development  of  India.  To  address  this  undersupply,  the  Government  established \nhydroelectric and thermal generation companies in the central sector, which comprises central \nGovernment-owned  power  utilities  (the  central  sector).  NTPC  was  incorporated  as  a \nGovernment  Company  under  the  Companies  Act,  1956  of  India  on  7  November  1975  as  the \nNational Thermal Power Corporation Limited. \n \n4. \nIn December 1976, the Government gave approval for NTPC to construct its first \"super \nthermal\"  (greater  than  1,000  MW)  power  project  at  Singrauli.  The  first  unit  at  Singrauli  was \nsuccessfully  commissioned  on  13  February  1982.  Since  1982,  through  expansion  of  existing \nplants, construction of new plants, and takeover of plants from state electricity units, NTPC has \ngrown to become the largest thermal generation utility in India with a total installed capacity as \nof 31 December 2005 of 23,935 MW (excluding joint ventures). \n \n\nHistory \n\n\fAppendix 2       29 \n\nNTPC's Relationship with the Government \n\nOn 28 October 2005, in order to give NTPC a new corporate identity, the name of NTPC \n5. \nwas  changed  from  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  Limited  to  NTPC  Limited.  The  new \nname  of  NTPC  signifies  the  substantial  ground  covered  by  NTPC  and  its  subsidiaries  in  the \nareas  of  hydropower,  coal  mining,  oil  and  gas  value  chain,  power  trading,  and  also  the \nsubstantial efforts in the area of power distribution. All the initiatives of backward, forward, and \nlateral  integration  are  primarily  aimed  at  strengthening  NTPC's  core  business  of  power \ngeneration. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nNTPC is currently 89.5% owned by the Government; the remaining 10.5% is vested with \nforeign institutional investors, financial institutions, banks, and the general public. The President \nof  India  is  the  beneficial  owner  of  the  Government  shareholding.  Under  NTPC's  Articles  of \nAssociation, the chairman and managing director (the CMD) is appointed by the Government of \nIndia. The remainder of NTPC's board of directors is appointed by the Government of India in \nconsultation  with  the  CMD,  except  for  the  Government's  nominee  directors  and  independent \ndirectors.  Independent  directors  as  well  as  Government-nominated  directors  are  appointed  by \nthe President of India. At present, the Board is comprised of five full-time directors, including the \nCMD,  two  part-time  directors  nominated  by  the  Government,  and  four  independent  directors \nwho are nonofficial part-time directors. NTPC's Articles of Association vest management power \nof NTPC in the Board.  \n \n7. \nBased on NTPC's performance, the Government in July 1997 named NTPC one of the \nnine  initial  Navratna  companies  (nine  jewels)  and  granted  it  enhanced  autonomy  in  making \nfinancial  and  other  decisions,  including  the  freedom  to  engage  in  investment,  capital \nexpenditures, and raising of funds at home and internationally without Government approval or \ninterference.  It  is  generally  permitted  to  form  joint  ventures  and  subsidiaries  up  to  specified \nlimits,  subscribe  equity  in  these  entities,  and  purchase  and  receive  new  technology  and \nknowledge  transfer.  It  is  permitted  to  decide  the  locations  for  its  plants  (a  matter  previously \ndetermined  by  the  Planning  Commission)  and  has  the  freedom  to  independently  negotiate \npower  purchase  agreements  with  its  customers.  In  addition,  NTPC  can  generally  borrow  from \nboth  the  domestic  and  international  markets.  However,  in  the  case  of  borrowing  from  the \ninternational market, NTPC is subject to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance and/or the \nReserve Bank of India. Under the existing guidelines, NTPC can borrow up to $500 million per \nannum from the international market without seeking any Government approvals. \n \nNTPC  pays  dividends  annually  to  the  Government  and  its  other  shareholders.  The \n8. \ndividend  paid  for  FY2005  was  Rs19,790  million  ($439.8  million),  or  34.1%  of  profits  after  tax, \nwhich is almost double the dividend paid for the previous fiscal year of Rs10,823 million ($240.5 \nmillion). NTPC's dividend target is 30% of profit after tax, but the policy allows NTPC to take into \naccount  its  requirements  for  internal  resources  to  fund  its  capacity  expansion  program.  The \ndeclaration and payment of a dividend is recommended prudently by the Board and approved \nby the NTPC shareholders. \n \nNTPC enters into an annual memorandum of understanding with the Government, which \n9. \nsets annual performance targets for the physical, financial, and dynamic parameters of NTPC. \nThese  parameters  include  total  electricity  generated,  availability  factor,  financial  gross  margin, \nand the ratio of net profit to net worth. An evaluation of the actual performance of NTPC against \nthe targets is conducted at the end of each fiscal year. NTPC has been placed in the excellent \ncategory  (the  best  category)  for  the  15th  consecutive  year  since  the  memorandum  of \nunderstanding system became operative in FY1988. \n\n \n\n\f30     Appendix 2 \n\nPower Generation Operations \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe engineering, construction, and operation of power plants for the thermal generation \nof power is the core business of NTPC. Sales of energy accounted for 90% of NTPC\u2019s operating \nincome  in  FY2005.  As  of  31  December  2005,  NTPC  owned  and  operated  23  power  plants \nlocated  throughout  India  (including  those  owned  by  joint  ventures),  which  generated  27.1%  of \nIndia's total power generation and constituted 19.6% of India's total installed capacity. A list of \nNTPC's  power  projects  that  are  commissioned,  under  implementation,  and/or  planned  during \nthe  10th  and  11th  plan  periods  is  contained  in  Appendix  4.  NTPC  sells  power  to  most  of  the \nstate  electricity  utilities  and  Indian  Railways.  In  FY2005,  NTPC  generated  159.1  billion  kWh \n(excluding joint ventures), an increase of 6.7% over the same period in the previous year. The \nmajority  of  generation  was  through  NTPC's  coal-fired  plants  (136.1  billion  kWh)  as  against  its \ngas-fired  plants  (23.0  billion  kWh).  NTPC\u2019s  facilities  are  located  throughout  India,  but  mostly \nconcentrated in the central and eastern states. \n \nHistorically, the operating performance of NTPC in its core business has been above the \n11. \nnational average. The availability factor1 for coal-fired stations increased from 85.9% in FY1995 \nto 91.2% in FY2005, which compares favorably against international standards. The plant load \nfactor2  (PLF)  at  coal-fired  stations  increased  from  76.6%  in  FY1995  to  87.5%  during  FY2005, \nwhich is the highest since the date of incorporation of NTPC (the Indian average during FY2005 \nbeing  74.8%  according  to  CEA).  Although  the  availability  factor  at  gas-fired  stations  is  high \n(82.4%  in  FY2005)  due  to  constraints  on  the  availability  of  gas,  the  PLF  is  significantly  lower \nthan  at  coal-fired  stations  (65.4%  in  FY2005).  NTPC  is  adopting  a  number  of  strategies  to \naddress this. From FY1995 to FY2005, employee productivity nearly doubled as measured by \nthe  ratio  of  revenue  to  number  of  employees.  While  installed  capacity  of  NTPC  increased  by \n50.0% between FY1995 and FY2005, employee numbers increased by only 8.6%. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nNTPC  has  a  current  installed  capacity  of  24,249  MW.  NTPC  plans  to  become  a \ngeneration company with power generation of 30,000 MW plus by the end of the 10th Plan (end \n2007), 46,000 MW plus by the end of the 11th Plan (end 2012), and 66,000 MW plus by the end \nof the 12th Plan (end 2017). NTPC plans to add a capacity of 9,160 MW during the 10th Plan \nand  17,052  MW  during  the  11th  Plan.  NTPC  is  adopting  a  multipronged  growth  strategy  for \ncapacity  addition  through  greenfield  projects,  expansion  of  existing  stations,  acquisitions  and \ntakeovers,  and  establishment  of  joint  ventures  and  subsidiaries.  In  addition  to  the  4,000  MW \nalready  commissioned  during  the  10th  Plan  and  8,970  MW  under  implementation  during  the \n10th and 11th plans, the basket of new generation projects identified for implementation in the \n10th  and  11th  plans  includes  both  greenfield  projects  and  the  expansion  of  existing  power \nplants. Appendix 4 provides a detailed list of expansion projects. \n \nF. \n \nNTPC  has  four  wholly  owned  subsidiaries.  Although  the  current  level  of  activity  of  the \n13. \nsubsidiaries  is  relatively  small  in  comparison  with  the  main  power  generation  operations  of \nNTPC,  they  form  part  of  NTPC's  diversification  business  strategy.  NTPC's  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary,  NTPC  Vidyut  Vyapar  Nigam  Limited,  was  incorporated  on  1  November  2002  to \n\nCapacity Expansion \n\nSubsidiaries \n\n                                                 \n1   The availability factor is a measure of how often a plant is available for being dispatched by the grid operator, \n2   The plant load factor is a measure of how much capacity is actually dispatched. \n\n\fAppendix 2       31 \n\nPower Purchase Agreements \n\nundertake power trading. In FY2005, it made a profit after tax of Rs57 million on gross income \nof  Rs5,992  million.  NTPC  incorporated  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  company,  NTPC  Electric \nSupply  Company  Limited,  in  August  2002  to  pursue  investments  in  electricity  distribution \nbusinesses.  In  FY2005,  it  made  a  profit  after  tax  of  Rs0.40  million  on  gross  income  of  Rs75 \nmillion.  Pipavav  Power  Development  Company  was  formed  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary \ncompany  of  NTPC  with  the  objective  of  acquiring  land  for  the  Pipavav  Mega  Power  project \n(2,000  MW)  and  to  perform  activity  related  to  site  development.  NTPC  incorporated  a  wholly \nowned subsidiary company, NTPC Hydro Limited, on 12 December 2002 to develop small- and \nmedium-sized3 hydroelectric power projects of up to 250 MW and to boost its capacity addition \nprogram in the hydroelectric sector. Its first hydroelectric project is Lata Tapovan hydroelectric \npower project (162 MW) in the state of Uttaranchal. As of March 2006, NTPC Hydro Limited had \nnot commenced operations of any hydroelectric power plants. \n \nG. \n \n14. \nThe capacity of each unit at each power station owned by NTPC is contracted to various \ncustomers under the PPAs. For coal-fired stations, the term of the PPA for each unit is 25 years. \nFor gas-fired stations, the term of the PPA for each unit is 15 years. As part of its investment \napproval  procedure,  NTPC  requires  PPAs  to  be  in  place  for  all  new  plants  before  approval  is \ngiven  for  investment.  All  existing  facilities  have  contracted  100%  of  their  capacity.  As  of  31 \nDecember  2005,  NTPC's  top  10  customers  and  their  respective  percentage  share  in  NTPC's \nrevenue  are  Uttar  Pradesh  (16.2%),  Maharashtra  (9.5%),  Andhra  Pradesh  (8.6%),  Madhya \nPradesh  (8.0%),  Delhi  (7.8%),  Tamil  Nadu  (5.4%),  Gujarat  (4.9%),  Orissa  (4.4%),  Haryana \n(4.2%), and Bihar (3.9%). \n \nH. \n \n15. \nperformance based, mainly comprising the following components: \n \n\nDifferent tariffs apply to each of NTPC's plants. The tariffs are notified by CERC and are \n\nTariffs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCapacity  charges  are  fixed  monthly  payments  made  by  each  of  the  plant \nbeneficiaries for making the plant capacity available. The fixed charges are made \nup of components such as operation and maintenance costs, debt servicing cost, \ndepreciation, and a fixed return on equity at 14% (post tax). Recovery of full fixed \ncharge is dependent on achieving target availability of 80% as prescribed in the \nrelevant regulations. \n \nEnergy  charges  primarily  comprise  a  pass  through  of  actual  fuel  cost  as  per \nprescribed  operational  norms  in  accordance  with  the  precommitted  daily \nschedule  of  dispatch,  which  is  a  schedule  of  power  supply  as  agreed  between \nNTPC and its customers on a daily basis. \n \nAn unscheduled interchange charge is made for any supply and consumption of \nenergy  that  differs  from  the  precommitted  daily  schedule  at  the  rates  based  on \ngrid frequency. \n \nAn  incentive  at  the  rate  of  Rs0.25  per  kWh  is  provided  for  scheduled  energy \nabove a target PLF of 80%. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Larger hydroelectric projects are undertaken by NTPC directly. \n\n \n\n\f32     Appendix 2 \n\n(v) \n\nForeign exchange rate variation and tax on the generation income of NTPC are \ntreated as passed through. \n\nFuel Supply \n\n \n16. \nIn  March  2004,  CERC  notified  NTPC  of  the  terms  and  conditions  for  determining  tariff \napplicable  with  effect  from  1  April  2004  for  5  years.  NTPC  has  made  a  tariff  petition  for  each \npower station in accordance with the said terms and conditions. CERC has yet to notify NTPC \nof  the  tariff  for  each  power  station  for  1  April  2004  to  31  March  2009.  Pending  final \ndetermination  of  the  tariff  for  this  period,  CERC  has  directed  NTPC  by  notification  that  on  a \nprovisional basis the annual fixed charges as applied on 31 March 2004 will be billed at target \navailability and variable charges based on norms of operation notified in regulation 2004. \n \nI. \n \n17. \nFuel  is  NTPC's  single  largest  expense  accounting  for  55.1%  of  revenue  distribution  in \nFY2005.  NTPC  uses  two  primary  fuel  sources:  coal  and  natural  gas.  Long-term  fuel  supply \nagreements tied to plant life (25 years for coal and 15 years for natural gas) are arranged before \nany new plant receives investment approval. To further support its power generation activities, \nNTPC implements hydroelectric power projects and is assessing the viability of entering into the \nfield  of  nuclear  power  generation.  An  increase  in  fuel  prices  would  have  an  effect  on  the \ndispatch  of  NTPC's  power  stations  as  units  are  dispatched  in  merit  order  (units  with  the \ncheapest  cost  of  generation  dispatched  first).  NTPC  is  pursuing  a  number  of  strategies  to \ncontrol increases in prices. \n \n\n1. \n\nCoal \n\n \n18. \nNTPC  procures  coal  from  subsidiaries  of  Coal  India  Limited,  a  Government-owned \nenterprise,  and  Singareni  Collieries  Company  Limited,  also  a  Government-owned  company. \nCoal supply for each of NTPC's plants is allocated by the Standing Linkage Committee, which is \na  Government  committee  led  by  a  representative  of  the  Ministry  of  Coal  along  with  members \nfrom the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Shipping, and Ministry of Surface Transport; and one \nmember  each  from  the  ministries  representing  the  various  utility  sectors,  including  MOP.  The \ncoal  requirements  of  projects  in  the  utility  sector  are  reviewed  by  the  Standing  Linkage \nCommittee  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Most  of  NTPC  coal-fired  stations  are  located  within  25 \nkilometers of the coal mines that supply the stations. These stations are serviced by dedicated \ntransportation  systems  owned  and  operated  by  NTPC,  which  reduce  supply  interruptions  and \ntransportation costs. \n \n19. \nFor  each  plant,  NTPC  enters  into  a  long-term  coal  supply  agreement  with  the  relevant \ncompany that runs the mine that services the plant. Each plant is supplied coal by specific coal \nmines  identified  by  the  Standing  Linkage  Committee  and  the  supplying  company.  Each  coal \nsupply  agreement  addresses  the  quality  and  quantity  of  coal  supply  required  for  sustained \ngeneration, provides for quantity flexibility on both a short- and long-term basis, and allows for \nalternative sources of supply as backup. The specifications of the coal are agreed up front, and \nNTPC has the right to reject coal that does not meet certain specified parameters. \n \n20. \nThe contracts provide that NTPC will purchase the quantity of coal necessary to run the \nplant at a PLF of 80%. NTPC is required to pay a penalty if it fails to purchase at least 90% of \nthat  quantity.  The  price  of  the  coal  varies  depending  on  its  calorific  value.  Prior  to  1996,  the \nGovernment determined coal prices. Since 1996, the Government has deregulated coal prices \nin a phased manner. Today, coal prices are determined by the supplying coal companies. Each \nof NTPC's coal supply agreements includes a pricing formula that sets the ceiling on the price \n\n\fAppendix 2       33 \n\nNTPC  can  be  charged,  and  also  includes  an  equitable  treatment  clause  so  that  if  the  coal \nsupplier is selling coal at a lower price to other customers, NTPC has the right to purchase coal \nat that lower price. \n \nAt  present,  the  overall  demand  for  steam/noncoking  coal  in  India  exceeds  production. \n21. \nThe  power  sector  currently  accounts  for  77%  of  demand  and  the  sector's  demand  for  steam \ncoal is expected to increase substantially in connection with its planned increases in capacity. \nNTPC's current coal supplies are sufficient to generate power to meet targets set by CEA. To \naddress any additional demand for coal, NTPC has decided to begin importing coal. In addition, \nto  reduce  the  cost  of  coal,  fill  gaps  in  fuel  availability,  and  as  a  fuel  security  measure,  NTPC \nintends to commence coal mining operations in the near future.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNatural Gas \n\n \n22. \nIndia's  domestic  natural  gas  supply  is  insufficient  to  satisfy  demand.  Natural  gas  is \nallocated to each of NTPC's plants by the Gas Linkage Committee, comprising a representative \nfrom the Ministry of Petroleum and National Gas, MOP, Ministry of Steel, Ministry of Fertilizers, \nMinistry of Chemical and Petrochemicals, Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, GAIL India \nLimited,  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation,  and  Oil  India  Limited.  Following  allocation,  NTPC \nenters into a long-term gas supply agreement with GAIL India Limited to purchase the allocated \ngas. Gas prices are fixed by the Ministry of Petroleum and National Gas using the administered \npricing  mechanism.  This  mechanism  is  used  by  the  Government  to  fix  gas  prices  based  on \nmarket  determined  pricing.  A  proposal  to  dismantle  the  administered  pricing  mechanism  for \nnatural  gas  and  institute  an  independent  petroleum  regulatory  board  to  regulate  prices  and \nsupply is under consideration by the Government. \n \n23.  While  most  of  NTPC's  gas-fired  stations  are  located  along  major  gas  pipelines,  NTPC \nhas experienced gas supply constraints, where less than the allocated amount of gas has been \nmade available. Due to the nonavailability of gas and the high prices of liquid fuel, NTPC added \nonly  2,700  MW  of  capacity  during  the  9th  Plan  as  against  a  proposal  for  adding  5,300  MW. \nNTPC requires 16 million cubic meters per day (mmcmd) of gas to run its gas-fired stations at a \nPLF  of  80%.  In  FY2005,  NTPC  received  10.4 mmcmd  of  gas,  which  represented 79.8%  of  its \nallocation  of  13  mmcmd.  To  increase  its  existing  gas  supplies,  NTPC  has  received  additional \ngas supplies from Parma Mukta Tapti gas fields, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited, \nand other gas sources increasing the gas supply level to 10.9 mmcmd on average for FY2006. \nNTPC also addresses gas shortages by using alternate fuels such as naphtha and high speed \ndiesel. However, these fuels are more expensive than gas and therefore their use increases the \ncost of supply and the  cost of power generated by the issuer. As a result, the PLF at its gas-\nfired stations was only 65.4% compared with 87.5% for its coal-fired stations in FY2005. \n \nTo have the affordability of gas prices for power generation, compatible with other fuel \n24. \noptions,  such  as  coal,  NTPC  is  considering  participating  in  different  elements  of  the  liquefied \nnatural  gas  value  chain  through  equity  participation  or  strategic  investments  with  prospective \npartners  in  both  India  and  internationally.  This  includes  participation  in  oil/gas  exploration, \nliquification  plants,  shipping  ventures,  and  regasification  plants.  The  NTPC-led  consortium  of \nCanaro  Resources  Ltd.  and  Geo  Petrol  International  has  been  allotted  an  oil  and  gas \nexploration  block  in  Arunachal  Pradesh  under  the  fifth  round  of  the  New  Exploration  and \nLicensing Policy by the Government. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f34     Appendix 2 \n\nWork Force \n\nManagement and the Board \n\nJ. \n \n25. \nAs  of  31  March  2005,  NTPC  had  approximately  21,420  employees,  comprising  8,566 \nexecutives and 12,854 nonexecutives; the turnover rate for its executive workforce was low at \n0.4% in FY2005. NTPC has never had any major strike or work stoppage, and currently has no \nunresolved strike proceedings. NTPC considers its relations with its employees to be good. In a \nsurvey  conducted  by  Business  Today  and  Hewitt  Associates  in  2003,  NTPC  was  ranked  the \nthird best employer in India. It retained this status during a survey held by Hewitt Associates and \nCNBC TV 18 in 2004. In addition, NTPC has been ranked the 5th best company to work for in \nIndia in a survey conducted by Business Today and Mercer Consulting in 2005. \n \nK. \n \n26. \nIn  accordance  with  its  Articles  of  Association, NTPC  is  managed  by  a  board.  Although \nthe CMD controls NTPC's day-to-day management, NTPC's management is by the board and \ndoes not depend on any key individuals. As of 1 April 2006, the Board comprised 11 directors. \nOf  these,  5  are  full-time  functional  directors  of  NTPC  including  the  CMD,  2  are  part-time \ndirectors nominated by the Government, and 4 are nonofficial part-time directors (independent \ndirectors).  Per  Article  49  of  the  Listing  Agreement,  50%  of  NTPC\u2019s  board  are  independent, \nnonexecutive directors. \n \n27. \nThe  functional  directors,  including  the  CMD,  are  appointed  for  5  years,  until  the \nincumbent reaches retirement age, or until further instructions from the Government, whichever \nevent occurs earlier. Government nominees representing the Government retire from the board \non  ceasing  to  be  officials  of  MOP.  Part-time  nonofficial  directors  are  appointed  by  the \nGovernment for a 3-year tenure. Currently, four part-time nonofficial directors are on the board. \nThe age limit of full-time functional directors, including the CMD, is 60 years. The current board \nof directors includes \n \n\nT. Sankaralingam, CMD of NTPC; \nChandan Roy, director (operations) of NTPC; \nR.S. Sharma, director (commercial) of NTPC;  \nR.K. Jain, director (technical) of NTPC; \nA.K. Singhal, director (finance) of NTPC; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)  M.

In March 2006, Fitch and S&P \nalso assigned a BB+ rating to the $1 billion medium-term note program closed by NTPC. These \nratings reflect its dominant market share, diversified asset portfolio, and strong financial profile. \nNTPC  maintains  a  AAA  issuer  local  rating  by  the  Investment  Information  and  Credit  Rating \nAgency  and  its  rupee  bonds  are  similarly  rated.  S&P  recently  upgraded  its  outlook  for  the \nsovereign  and  NTPC  to  positive  from  stable  based  on  overall  fiscal  improvements  in  India. \nDespite such strong financial indicators and AAA local credit ratings, NTPC\u2019s foreign currency \nratings  are  constrained  by  being  majority  owned  by  the  Government,  so  that  its  rating  cannot \nsurpass the sovereign\u2019s own rating of BB+. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nA summary of historical financial performance is included in Table A3.1. The most recent \nfinancial results were analyzed and some of the reasons for its performance and year-on-year \nchanges  indicated  in  this  appendix.  The  information  was  gathered  from  audited  financial \nstatements  prepared  by  NTPC  in  accordance  with  its  accounting  policies,  which  conform  to \nIndian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and have been audited by its statutory \nauditors in accordance with Indian auditing standards. \n \n\nHistorical Financial Performance \n\n \n\n\fTable A3.1: Historical Financial Performance \n(Rs billion, unless otherwise stated) \n\n9 Months \nEnding \n31/12/05\n\nFiscal \n2005\n\nFiscal \n2004\n\nFiscal \n2003\n\nFiscal \n2002\n\n        \n            \n          \n            \n          \n          \n\n188.5\n8.4\n46.4\n7.2\n19.9\n42.5\n\n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n\n231.9\n16.9\n66.4\n11.4\n29.8\n58.1\n\n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n\n198.4\n20.0\n49.2\n10.9\n61.3\n52.6\n\n        \n            \n          \n            \n            \n          \n\n194.5\n9.1\n57.1\n9.5\n4.0\n36.1\n\n        \n           \n          \n            \n            \n          \n\n178.3\n(7.9)\n50.7\n7.8\n6.7\n35.4\n\n          \n\n94.9\nn/a\n179.5\n180.8\n460.3\n641.1\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n87.9\n322.4\n170.3\n172.6\n417.8\n590.4\n\n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n66.4\n287.5\n153.5\n156.2\n355.5\n511.7\n\n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n23.9\n262.3\n130.7\n133.8\n315.1\n448.9\n\n          \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n\n13.7\n238.1\n93.9\n117.6\n286.5\n404.1\n\n          \n         \n           \n\n         \n           \n         \n\n51.7\n(35.5)\n(7.8)\n0\n(11.3)\n(1.2)\n(15.2)\n\n          \n         \n         \n          \n         \n            \n         \n\n77.4\n(53.7)\n(11.7)\n26.8\n(23.4)\n5.1\n(28.6)\n\n          \n         \n         \n\n           \n          \n         \n\n60.5\n(46.7)\n(10.0)\n0\n(3.5)\n20.0\n(16.2)\n\n          \n         \n           \n\n         \n           \n         \n\n74.9\n(32.9)\n(9.2)\n0\n(11.1)\n(5.9)\n(15.2)\n\n          \n         \n           \n\n           \n         \n         \n\n62.7\n(30.8)\n(8.9)\n0\n(8.2)\n(16.2)\n(24.6)\n\n            \n\nCredit Ratios\n4.5\nInterest Cover\n3.8\nDebt Service Cover\n3.2\nTotal Debt / EBITDA\n44:56\nDebt to Equity\nReturn on Net Worth (%)\n14.8\n( ) = negative, EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\na For these purposes, EBITDA excludes non-operational income.\nSource: NTPC financial statements.\n\n5.8\n5.0\n2.6\n41:59\n13.9\n\n6.4\nn/a\n3.9\n39:61\n9.2\n\n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n\n \n\n            \n            \n            \n\n6.0\n1.3\n3.3\n42:58\n11.5\n\n            \n            \n            \n\n6.5\n2.7\n2.3\n41:59\n12.4\n\n36     Appendix 3 \n\nItem\nIncome Statement\nRevenues\nRevenue Growth (%)\nEBITDAa\nInterest Incurred\nNon-Operational Income\nNet Income\n\nBalance Sheet\nCash and Equivalents\nTotal Net Fixed Assets\nSenior Long-Term Debt\nTotal Debt\nCommon Equity\nTotal Capital\n\nCash Flow\nCash Flow from Operations\nCapital Expenditure\nFinancing Cost\nEquity Raised\nDividends\nNet Debt Decrease/(Increase)\nNet Free Cash Flow\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 3       37  \n\n1. \n\nSales, Revenue, and Operating Profit \n\n \n3. \nBased  on  the  cost-plus  nature  of  the  tariff  setting  process  and  its  superior  operating \nefficiency,  NTPC  has  consistently  increased  its  sales  and  operating  profit.  In  FY2005,  sales \nrevenue accounted for Rs231.9 billion ($5.1 billion) resulting in operating profit of Rs60.7 billion \n($1.4 billion). This compares favorably with FY2004 results of sales turnover of Rs198.4 billion \n($4.4 billion) and operating profit of Rs59.0 billion ($1.3 billion), indicating sales growth of 16.9% \nand  operating  profit  growth  of  3.0%.  In  the  9  months  ending  31  December  2005,1  NTPC \ngenerated  Rs188.5  billion  in  net  sales  and  operating  profit  of  Rs44.5  billion.  This  revenue  is \nenhanced  by  nonoperational  interest  income  earned  on  the  8.5%  tripartite  agreement  (TPA) \nbonds issued by the state governments as well as nonoperational income from other long-term \ninvestments.2  NTPC  produced  profits  after  tax  of  Rs58.1  billion  ($1.3  billion)  for  FY2005  and \nRs52.6 billion ($1.2 billion) for FY2004. \n \n4. \nRevenues are principally driven by capacity and tariffs. Tariffs are based on a cost-plus \nformula under which all operating costs and a 14% return on equity can be recovered. Prior to \nthe 2004 tariff order, the rate of return on equity was 16%; this reduction will moderately reduce \nNTPC\u2019s  earnings  in  the  future.  While  tariffs  have  been  steadily  reduced  since  the  mid  1990s, \nNTPC\u2019s aggressive capital expenditure program should boost revenues over the medium term \nas  new  capacity  is  commissioned. As  an  indication,  revenue  increased  16.9%  in  FY2005  with \nthe commissioning of 2,000 megawatts (MW) and is expected to increase by 8.4% in FY2006. \nOperating  margins  have  historically  been  in  the  mid  to  high  30%  range,  but  the  tightening  of \nminimum  plant  operating  standards  (ironically  as  a  result  of  NTPC\u2019s  excellent  performance \nrecord)  has  partially  reduced  NTPC\u2019s  ability  to  earn  incentive  payments  for  plant  load  factors \nabove the target threshold.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLiquidity and Cash Flow \n\n \n5. \nNTPC has stable cash flow from its existing power generation operations at 23 different \nplants  throughout  India.  Net  cash  from  operations  in  FY2005  was  Rs50.5  billion,  as  against \nRs57.4 billion in the previous year. This reduction is due to an increase in debtors following the \nwrite  back  of  provisions,  while  liabilities  decreased  following  adjustment  of  advances  received \nfrom customers, resulting in increased use of cash in working capital. Liquidity risks are reduced \nby NTPC\u2019s significant balances of cash and cash equivalents (Rs95 billion or $2.1 billion as of \n31  December  2005),  and  strong  and  stable  cash  flows  from  operations.  As  indicated  earlier, \nNTPC\u2019s cash inflow has been enhanced by interest income from the TPA bonds. This income \nwill  continue  to  modestly  improve  cash  flows  over  the  medium  term.  NTPC  could  also  raise \nmore cash, if necessary, by liquidating a portion of the bonds each year as provided for in the \nTPA agreements. Until now, it has elected not to sell any of the bonds. \n \n6. \nCash  flow  has  been  generally  pressured  by  high  capital  expenditures,  dividends,  and \nfinancing costs. Capital expenditures have increased consistently from Rs25 billion in FY2001 to \nRs53.7 billion in FY2005. For 9 months ending 31 December 2005, capital expenditures were \nRs35.5 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to grow substantially, to be financed mostly by \ndebt and internal cash generation per the tariff guidelines on financing.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Audited results for FY2006, which ended on 31 March 2006, are not yet available. \n2   Interest  on  the  TPA  bonds  added  Rs34,854  million  to  operational  earnings  in  FY2004  and  Rs13,949  million  in \nFY2005. Because this interest is essentially recovery of the principal and surcharges on past electricity sales, it is \nconsidered here as operational income. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38     Appendix 3 \n\n \n7. \nHistorically, dividends paid have been approximately 25\u201330% of profit after tax and have \nbeen  adjusted  annually  based  on  the  profit  earned,  future  capital  expenditures,  cash  flow \nsituation,  and  financing  needs.  NTPC  paid  a  Rs20.7  billion  dividend  (net  of  dividend  tax)  in \nFY2005, up from Rs3.1 billion in FY2004. The Board has taken prudent decisions with regard to \nrecommending  dividend  levels  to  shareholders  for  their  approval.  Return  on  net  worth  was \n13.9%  and  14.9%  in  FY2005  and  2004  respectively.  Finance  charges  have  been  consistent \nbetween Rs9 billion and Rs11 billion per year, but interest coverage ratios have been 5.8 times \nEBITDA3  (5.8x),  4.5x  and  6.0x  for  the  last  3  years.  These  three  items\u2014capital  expenditures, \ndividends,  and  financing  costs\u2014have  generally  been  responsible  for  the  net  cash  flows  in \nrecent  years.  However,  these  outflows  have  not  resulted  in  significant  additional  net  debt  in \nrecent  years  having  been  offset  by  revenue  growth,  nonoperational  income  from  bonds  and \nother  investments,  and  the  proceeds  in  FY2005  from  its  public  offering  (a  net  cash  inflow  of \nRs26.8 billion or $595.6 million). \n \n\n3. \n\nExisting Capital Structure \n\n \n8. \nNTPC's funding operations are designed to ensure the necessary financial resources are \navailable  to  fund  the  current  and  proposed  expansion  of  its  generation  capacity  at  the  lowest \npossible funding cost. NTPC's primary source of funding traditionally has been foreign currency \nloans  from  multilateral  or  bilateral  financial  agencies.  These  loans  were  guaranteed  by  the \nGovernment.  More  recently,  NTPC  has  undertaken  foreign-currency-denominated  external \ncommercial  borrowings  in  the  form  of  export  credits  for  imported  equipment;  issuance  of \nEurobonds  and  syndicated  loans;  and  domestic  borrowings  denominated  in  rupees,  including \nterm loans and bonds. In the past, NTPC's debt funding has been either secured or unsecured \ndepending on the availability of funds and the cost of borrowing.  \n \n9. \nNTPC has maintained low debt levels and robust interest coverage ratios since the late \n1990s despite rising capital expenditures and modest cash outflows. Total debt to EBITDA was \n2.6x  in  FY2005  and  3.2x  in  FY2004.  For  the  9  months  ending  31  December  2005,  the \nannualized  rate  is  2.9x.  NTPC\u2019s  long-term  liabilities  in  FY2005  were  Rs170.3  billion  ($3.8 \nbillion);  28%  of  this  debt  is  denominated  in  foreign  currency.  Under  the  current  tariff  order, \nfluctuations in exchange rates for offshore debt repayments are recoverable through the tariff. \nAs  of  31  March  2005,  NTPC  has  secured  liabilities  of  Rs44.4  billion  ($986.8  million),  and \nunsecured  debt  of  Rs126.4  billion  ($2.8  billion).  Only  26%  of  its  total  long-term  liabilities  is \nsecured and is comprised solely of rupee bonds and one loan from the World Bank.4 Unsecured \ndebt  is  comprised  of  bank  loans  denominated  in  local  currency  (60%);  bank  loans  in  foreign \ncurrency,  some  of  which  are  guaranteed  by  the  Government  (26%);  bonds  denominated  in \nforeign  currency,  namely  Eurobonds  (7%);  fixed  deposits  (3%);  and  one  bond  issuance \ndenominated in local currency5 (4%). Table A3.2 demonstrates the relative magnitude between \nthe two classes of debt: \n \n\n                                                 \n3  EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \n4  A loan of $400 million made by the World Bank in December 1993 to specifically finance construction of the Rihand \nSuper Thermal Power Plant is secured against these fixed assets. This loan is guaranteed by the Government of \nIndia. \n\n5  Has since been secured as required by law. \n\n\fAppendix 3       39  \n\nTable A3.2: NTPC Debt Structure \n(Rs million) \n\n FY 2002 \n\n   FY 2004 \n\n16,455 \n99,357 \n\n45,844 \n108,684 \n\nFY 2003 \n41,226 \n90,931 \n\n FY 2005 \n44,407 \n126,421 \n\nAuditing Arrangements and Financial Management \n\n \nItem \nSecured debt \nUnsecured debt \nSource: NTPC financial statements. \n \nAs  disclosed  in  the  annual  financial  statements,  contingent  liabilities  as  of  31  March \n10. \n2005  are  Rs19.7  billion  ($440  million)  as  against  Rs19.5  billion  in  FY2004.  These  comprise \nmainly  claims  relating  to  capital  works,  local  court  cases  in  which  residents  are  petitioning  for \nenhanced land compensation payments,6 and other minor claims. External audit reports indicate \nthat the contingent liabilities disclosed by NTPC are sufficient to cover the pending cases. \n \nC. \n \nNTPC\u2019s  independent  auditors  are  appointed  each  year  by  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor \n11. \nGeneral  of  India  (C&AG),  the  authority  for  appointment  of  auditors  of  state-owned  companies \nper Section 619 of the Companies Act. International accounting firms are not currently permitted \nto  practice  in  India.  Therefore,  local  firms  of  chartered  accountants  undertake  the  audit  of \nNTPC\u2019s financial statements. More than one firm is required to complete the audit (five, in the \ncase  of  NTPC),  with  each  firm  undertaking  a  specific  region\u2019s  accounts  to  audit.  This  is  not \nuncommon  for  large  state-owned  companies  in  India  with  widespread  operations.  Financial \nstatements are prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP audited on an annual and semiannual \nbasis.  The  draft  reports  are  first  reviewed  by  and  discussed  with  the  audit  committee  before \nthen being submitted to the board of directors for its review and approval. \n \n12. \nAs a state-owned enterprise, NTPC is required to undergo an audit review by the C&AG \nin  addition  to  the  statutory  audit  conducted.  As  part  of  this  review,  the  C&AG  is  required  to \nreview  the  company\u2019s  financial  management  and  control  system.  This  includes  functional \nreviews  of  its  corporate  governance  and  audit  committee,  business  risks,  system  of  accounts \nand financial control, fraud risk, asset management, award and execution of contracts, internal \naudit,  human  resources,  legal  cases,  and  review  of  its  electronic  data  processing  and \nmanagement  information  systems.  No  serious  concerns  were  raised  in  the  C&AG  report  for \nFY2005  that  would  indicate  any  internal  control  or  audit  risk  to  NTPC\u2019s  ability  to  properly \nmanage its financial accounts and systems. \n\n                                                 \n6  Enhanced compensation is above and beyond what has been paid under the Land Acquisition Act. As assessed by \n\nADB, this has no implication on compliance with ADB safeguard policies. \n\n \n\n\f40     Appendix 4 \n\nPower Project\nA. Northern Region\n1. Singrauli\n2. Rihand\n3.Tanda\n4.

Brief \ndescriptions  of  these  projects  are  contained  here.  Further  information  is  contained  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nA. \n \n\nKahalgaon Super Thermal Power Plant, Stage II \n\n1. \n\nProject Description \n\n \nThe Kahalgaon Stage II STPP is 1,500 megawatts (MW) in capacity, consisting of two \n2. \nphases being constructed concurrently: phase I for 1,000 MW (2 x 500 MW units); and phase II \nfor  500  MW  (1  x  500  MW  unit).  The  three  500  MW  steam  generators  are  all  traditional  units. \nTotal annual electricity generation from the Stage II STPP will be 10,500 gigawatts (GWh), with \ngenerated electricity supplying the northern, eastern, and western regions of India. Construction \nof Kahalgaon Stage II commenced in July 2003. Commissioning of Stage II units will occur over \n6 months, with the first unit scheduled to come on line in November 2006.  \n \nThe project site is located 3\u20134 kilometers (km) south of Kahalgaon township and 4 km \n3. \nwest of the Ganges River in Bhagalpur district, Bihar state. The Stage II plant and all associated \nfacilities  except  the  water  supply  pipeline  are  being  constructed  within  the  existing  Kahalgaon \nSTPP Stage I site. The Stage II site covers 400 hectares (ha), consisting of the main plant and \nswitchyard (96 ha), an ash dyke (296 ha), and township extension (8 ha). \n \n4. \nCoal to power the Stage II plant will be mined from the Rajmahal Expansion coalfields. \nThe total annual coal consumption of Stage II is estimated to be 9.99 million tons. Water will be \nsourced  from  the  Ganges  River  via  new  pumps  fitted  into  the  Stage  I  pump  house.  Water \nextraction for Stage II will average 5,845 cubic meters (m3) per hour (1.62 m3/second) to meet \nall plant and facility requirements once the ash water recirculation system is operational. \n \nAn annual production of 4.1 million tons of ash is expected. High efficiency electrostatic \n5. \nprecipitators  (99.9%  efficient)  will  trap  fly  ash  in  dry  form.  Ash  will  then  be  taken  in  buffer \nhoppers  for  onward  transportation  in  dry  form  or  slurrified  in  wetting  units  for  pumping  to  ash \nponds for disposal. Bottom ash will be extracted and disposed of in wet form. Different forms of \nliquid effluent from the plant will be collected and recycled, or treated in the central monitoring \nbasin and discharged from the site. Treated effluent discharge will total 1,020 m3/hour when ash \nwater  recirculation  occurs.  Power  from  the  plant  will  be  evacuated  via  a  new  400  kilovolt  (kV) \nhigh  voltage  transmission  line  from  Kahalgaon  to  Biharsharif  being  installed  by  Power  Grid  of \nIndia Ltd. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Economics \n\n \nThe  need  for  the  additional  power  generation  has  been  identified  by  the  Central \n6. \nElectricity  Authority  (CEA),  Ministry  of  Power.1  CEA  identified  a  9.7%  shortage  in  terms  of \nanticipated  peak  and  a  4.8%  deficit  in  energy  availability  in  the  year  beginning  April  1998. \nDuring the same period the western region had a 21.4% shortage in terms of anticipated peak \nand a 5.1% deficit in energy availability. Accordingly, for the Government to fully meet electricity \n\n                                                 \n1   Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power. 1998. 15th Electric Power Survey of India. New Delhi.  \n\n \n\n\f42     Appendix 5 \n\ndemand by 2012 the without project scenario is not a viable option. Without the Project, industry \nexpansion would be stifled and residential consumption of electricity limited. \n \n7. \nIn  conducting  a  least-cost  generation  analysis  for  the  country,  CEA  considered  the \neconomics of generation and transmission, losses in the system, load center requirements, grid \nstability,  security  of  supply,  quality  of  power  including  voltage  profile,  and  environmental \nconsiderations  including  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  (footnote  1).  The  most  cost-effective \noption  was  determined  to  be  coal-fired  thermal  power  generation  located  near  the  fuel  source \n(i.e., mine mouth). This form of generation delivers a lower cost per kWh than  either gas-fired \nthermal or hydroelectric plants, because of the transportation cost of imported natural gas or the \ntransmission cost of electricity produced by hydroelectric plants. \n \nThe Kahalgaon Stage 1 STPP site was selected as the optimum site for the additional \n8. \nStage  II  generating  units  as  NTPC  had  sufficient  land  to  accommodate  the  plant  without  the \nneed  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Other  favorable  site  features  include  adequate \navailable coal nearby (32 km away), a very reliable water source nearby, and the ability to use \nsome Stage 1 infrastructure to service the additional units (e.g., merry-go-round, pump house, \nsite  roads,  and  accommodation).  The  site  is  also  remote  from  other  large-scale  industrial \ndevelopments.  \n \nIn  its  comprehensive  feasibility  study,  NTPC  carried  out  an  economic  analysis  of  the \n9. \nexpansion  of  the  Kahalgaon  Project,  and  has  indicated  an  internal  rate  of  return  of  12%.  The \nmain quantifiable economic benefit of the Project will be the value of 10,500 GWh of incremental \nelectricity generated and added to the grid. The economic unit cost of generation for each unit is \nRs1.72 per kWh ($0.038 per kWh).  \n \nB. \n \n\nSipat Super Thermal Power Plant, Stages I and II \n\n1. \n\nDescription \n\n \n10. \nThe  Sipat  STPP  consists  of  two  stages  that  are  being  constructed  concurrently:  Stage \nI\u20141,980  MW  (3  x  660  MW  units);  and  Stage  II\u20141,000  MW  (2  x  500  MW  units).  Total  annual \nelectricity  generation  from  STPP  will  be  20,883  GWh,  with  generated  electricity  supplying  the \nwestern region of India via Seoni. Construction of Sipat stages I & II commenced simultaneously \nin late 2003. Stage II (2 x 500 MW) will be completed prior to Stage I, with the first and second \nunits scheduled to be commissioned in June and December 2007. Commissioning of Stage I (3 \nx 660 MW) will occur over 20 months, with the first unit scheduled to come on line in April 2008.  \n \n11. \nThe  project  site  is  located  near  Sipat  village,  Bilaspur  district,  Chhattisgarh  state.  The \nsite covers 1,753 ha, consisting of: the main plant and switchyard (621 ha), ash dykes (632 ha), \nreservoir and township (257 ha), and merry-go-round  rail coal transport system (243 ha). \n \n12. \nCoal  to  power  the  plant  will  be  mined  from  the  Dipika  (extension)  mine  block  of  Korba \ncoalfield.  The  total  coal  consumption  of  the  plant  will  be  2,122  tons/hour  (18.59  million \ntons/annum).  The  Stage  I  steam  generators  are  660  MW  \u201csuper-critical  water  tube,  direct \npulverized  coal-fired,  balanced  draft  furnace,  single  reheat,  radiant,  dry  bottom  type,\u201d  the  first \nsupercritical plant to be installed in India. The Stage II generators are 500 MW traditional steam  \ntechnology. \n \n13.  Water  will  be  pumped  from  the  right  bank  canal  that  is  fed  by  the  Hasdeo  Barrage, \nlocated  approximately  65  km  from  the  site.  The  maximum  water  requirement  for  the  plant  is \n\n\fAppendix 5        43 \n\nestimated  to  be  13,400  m3/hour  (3.72)  with  once-through  ash  water  recirculation  operating  for \nStage I. \n \n14. \nAround  6.4  million  tons  of  ash  will  be  produced  annually.  High  efficiency  electrostatic \nprecipitators  (99.9%  efficient)  will  trap  fly  ash  in  dry  form.  Ash  will  then  be  taken  in  buffer \nhoppers  for  onward  transportation  in  dry  form  or  slurrified  in  wetting  units  for  pumping  to  ash \nponds  for  disposal.  Bottom  ash  will  be  extracted  and  disposed  of  in  wet  form.  Liquid  effluent \nfrom  the  plant  will  be  collected  and  recycled,  or  treated  in  the  central  monitoring  basin  and \ndischarged from the site. Treated effluent discharge will total 1,265 m3/hour of industrial waste \nand  529  m3/hour  of  domestic  waste.  Power  from  the  plant  will  be  evacuated  via  new  765  kV \nhigh voltage transmission lines to Seoni and associated 400 kV lines, being installed by Power \nGrid Corporation of India Ltd. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Economics \n\n \n15. \nThe need for the additional power generation was identified by CEA, Ministry of Power, \nin  an  electricity  supply  and  demand  analysis  for  the  western  region  of  India.  The  analysis \nprojected a 4.9% deficit in power supply in 1996 and a 1% deficit in 1997. By 2003, the power \nsupply position in the western region was a 20.3% deficit at peak periods and a 12.6% deficit in \nenergy  availability  versus  demand.  The  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenario  would  mean  that  this \nsignificant energy deficit in the western region would continue, stifling the expansion of industry \nand curbing residential consumption of electricity. The Project will generate 2,980 MW of power \nin the region. \n \nIn  preparing  its  least-cost  analysis  for  India,  CEA  considered  the  economics  of \n16. \ngeneration  and  transmission;  losses  in  the  system;  load  center  requirements;  grid  stability; \nsecurity of supply; quality of power, including voltage profile; and environmental considerations, \nincluding rehabilitation and resettlement (footnote 2). The most cost-effective option was found \nto  be  coal-fired  thermal  power  generation  located  near  the  fuel  source  (i.e.,  the  mine  mouth). \nBecause  of  the  significant  transport  cost  savings  over  imported  natural  gas  or  transmission  of \nelectricity  from  hydropower  sites  in  other  grid  regions  (i.e.,  the  northern  and  eastern  regions), \nthis  form  of  power  generation  delivers  a  lower  cost  per  kWh  than  either  gas-fired  thermal  or \nhydroelectric plants.  \n \n17. \nCEA identified the general locality for the plant primarily on the basis of its proximity to \nthe  Korba  coalfield.  The  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State \nElectricity  Board  then  suggested  four  alternative  sites  for  the  3,000  MW  plant  (Bishrampur, \nBirsinghpur, Ratanpur, and Sipat). NTPC conducted a detailed analysis of these sites, based on \nthe  availability  of  suitable  land  (800  ha  of  barren  land),  distance  from  coal  source  (40  km), \navailability and distance from a reliable water source (65 km), road and rail access, availability \nof infrastructure, and environmental impact.  \n \n18. \nIn its comprehensive feasibility study, NTPC has carried out an economic analysis of the \nSipat  Project  and  has  indicated  an  internal  rate  of  return  of  14%.  The  main  quantifiable \neconomic benefit will be the value of 20,883 GWh of incremental electricity generation added to \nthe western region grid. The economic cost of generation from STPP is about Rs1.49 per kWh \n($0.033 per kWh).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44     Appendix 6 \n\nASSESSING DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS \n\n \n\nConcept \n\nImpact \n\nPerformance Measure \n\nA.

This  manual,  dated  1  May  2005,  addresses  all  essential  components  of  an \nEMS, including the plant-specific environment policy, planning procedures, implementation and \noperation, checking, corrective action, and management review.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDescription  of  Environmental  Performance  Monitoring  and  Reporting \nSystem \n\n \n16. \nEnvironmental performance monitoring is undertaken weekly at each plant, with monthly \nreports sent to each relevant state pollution control board. The corporate center and each plant \n\n\fAppendix 7        49 \n\nis  regularly  audited  under  the  requirements  of  ISO  14001  certification.  Internal  audits  are \nconducted  every  quarter  to  verify  performance,  with  external  surveillance  audits  conducted \nevery year to monitor EMS compliance and every 3 years for ISO 14001 reaccreditation. \n \nOngoing monitoring of parameters relating to the main project environmental impacts at \n17. \neach  plant  is  conducted  to  verify  compliance  with  environmental  clearance  conditions,  with \nmeteorological conditions also monitored to assess the dispersion of plant emissions. The main \nparameters  monitored  are  ambient  air  quality  and  emissions  (suspended  particulate  matter, \nsulfur  dioxide  and  nitrogen  oxides);  and  effluents  (pH,  total  suspended  solids,  biochemical \noxygen  demand,  chemical  oxygen  demand,  total  dissolved  solids,  chlorides,  sulphates,  total \ndissolved phosphates, oil and grease, heavy metals). Monitoring procedures are in accordance \nwith the standards published by the Bureau of India Standards, Central Pollution Control Board \nand  other  relevant  authorities,  with  the  parameters  required  by  statutory  bodies  generally \nanalyzed as per methods of the Bureau of India Standards. \n \n18. \nNTPC  operates  laboratories  at  the  station  level  and  at  the  corporate  research  and \ndevelopment center to conduct routine measurements and advanced testing and research, with \nsome environmental laboratories approved by state pollution control boards. \n \n19. \nwith consent conditions and relevant laws and regulations. Auditing consists of the following: \n \n\nQuarterly  environmental  auditing  is  undertaken  at  each  station  to  ensure  compliance \n\nPreparatory  activities.  Pre  visit  information  is  obtained  from  the  power  station \nand  reviewed  by  the  audit  team  consisting  of  4\u20135  team  members.  The  main \nareas  for  consideration  are  identified  and  specific  tasks  are  allocated  to  team \nmembers. \n\nOn-site  visit.  The  audit  team  conducts  an  on-site  inspection  of  activities  and \nfacilities,  visits  the  surrounding  neighborhood,  and  discusses  issues  with  staff. \nDiscussions are usually conducted as per a protocol that incorporates a flexible \nchecklist.  A  draft  audit  report  describing  findings  and  recommendations  is \nprepared during the visit and presented to senior management at the conclusion \nof the audit. \n\nPost visit activities. The full audit report is prepared within 3\u20134 weeks of the on-\nsite visit and presented to site management. Site management then develops a \nplan  of  action  as  soon  as  possible  to  address  the  audit  findings  and \nrecommendations. \n\n \n(iv)  Management  reporting.  Each  plant  monitors  emissions,  ambient  air  quality, \neffluent  discharge,  and  ash  pond  effluents;  and  reports  this  data  to  the  general \nmanager of the station and the corporate center EMG. Monthly exception reports \nare submitted to management detailing any nonconformance. Decisions are then \ntaken  to  rectify  nonconformance  with  corrective  actions,  whose  implementation \nare periodically monitored. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Projects \n\n \nG. \n \nAs it owns and operates its projects, NTPC will not onlend loan funds for subprojects as \n20. \nin  a  traditional  FI  project.  The  Kahalgaon  Stage  II  and  Sipat  stages  I  &  II  STPPs  have  been \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n     Appendix 7 \n\nassessed  and  approved  in  accordance  with  Government  and  relevant  state  government \nrequirements. \n \n21. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  pollution  prevention  standards  for  new  coal-fired  thermal \npower plants differ in a number of aspects. The ADB standards for plant emissions, ambient air \nquality,  and  effluent,  as  set  out  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Pollution  Prevention  and  Abatement \nHandbook,4 are generally more stringent than the Government standards. ADB has reviewed the \nproject  environmental  impact  assessments  and  approvals,  and  where  the  ADB  pollution \nstandard is more stringent, NTPC has revised the proposed mitigation measures to achieve the \nADB  standard  for  the  Kahalgaon  Stage  II  and  Sipat  STPPs.  In  the  event  that  NTPC  requests \nADB funds to be applied to other NTPC projects, NTPC\u2019s environmental assessment and review \nprocedures  will  be  followed  and  supplemented  as  necessary  to  comply  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies. \n \nH. \n \n\nRecommendations on Environmental Management Systems \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Management System  \n\n \n22. \nThe  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  released  the  ISO  14001 \nstandard in 1997 to provide a best practice specification for the implementation of an EMS. The \n1995  corporate  center  EPEMS  was  not  written  in  accordance  with  ISO  14001  requirements, \nalthough the corporate center was accredited under ISO 14001 in 2001. The EPEMS provides \nthe  overall  framework  for  environmental  management,  but  it  does  not  contain  the  essential \ncomponents of an EMS. In addition, ISO 14001 requires \u201ccontinual improvement,\u201d with an EMS \nbeing  a  living  document;  but  the  EPEMS  has  not  been  updated  since  1995,  therefore  some \nsections are well out of date. \n \n23. \nIn  comparison,  the  Kahalgaon  EMS  Manual  is  a  comprehensive  plan  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ISO  14001  requirements.  It  provides  a  clear  and  coordinated  system  for \nenvironmental management during plant operation; defining environment policy, responsibilities, \nand procedures. The NTPC corporate center EPEMS should be updated in line with ISO 14001 \nrequirements, and coordinated with the ISO 14001-compliant plant EMS manuals. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n \n24. \nNTPC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  are  in  accordance  with \ncentral  and  state  government  requirements  as  evidenced  by  the  granting  of  development \napproval  for  the  Kahalgaon  Stage  II  and  Sipat  STPPs.  Despite  this,  documented  assessment \nand  review  procedures  were  not  available  from  NTPC,  indicating  that  they  have  yet  to  be \nformalized  as  part  of  the  NTPC  EMS.  NTPC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures should be formalized as a supporting guideline for the EPEMS. \n \n\n3. \n\nPlant Environmental Management Plans \n\n \nIt  is  recommended  that  NTPC  prepares  a  comprehensive  template  environmental \n25. \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  for  future  coal-fired  thermal  power  plants  to  provide  consistent \nconstruction and operation management measures for all new plants. The EMP should describe \nthe  main  plant  environmental  management  measures,  management  responsibilities,  and \n\n                                                 \n4   World Bank. 1998. Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington, DC. \n\n\fAppendix 7        51 \n\nSummary \n\nimplementation  schedule  common  to  most  projects,  from  which  plant-specific  EMPs  would  be \ndeveloped. \n \nI. \n \n26. \nNone of the recommended actions to improve NTPC\u2019s EMS and related procedures are \nessential prior to ADB providing financing for NTPC to be applied to the Kahalgaon Stage II and \nSipat STPPs. Revision of the EPEMS will improve NTPC\u2019s environmental management, but the \nkey  component  of  the  overall  EMS  is  the  ISO  14001-compliant  plant  EMS  manual  for  each \nplant.  These  manuals  establish  a  comprehensive  EMS  for  plant  operation,  effectively  dealing \nwith the main project impacts. Formalization of NTPC\u2019s environmental assessment and review \nprocedures, and drafting of a template EMP for coal-fired thermal plants, will mainly assist in the \nformulation  and  management  of  new  projects  to  be  constructed,  therefore  they  should  be \npresented to NTPC as recommendations, not precursors to loan processing. \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 May 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \nRs1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Rs) \n$0.022 \nRs45.00 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \n \nAPDRP \nC&AG   \nCEA \n \nCERC   \n \nCFS \nCMD \n \nCPSU   \nEBITDA \n \n \n \nEMG \n \nEMS \nEMP \n \nEPEMS \n \n  \n \nIPO \nISO \n \nLIBOR  \nmmscmd  \nMOP \nNEP \nNm3 \nNTPC   \n \n  \n \nPLF \n \nPPA \n \nRBI \nSEB \n \nSERC   \nSTPP   \n \nT&D \n \nTPA \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAccelerated Power Development Reform Program \nComptroller and Auditor General of India \nCentral Electricity Authority \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission \ncomplementary financing scheme \nchairman and managing director \ncentral power sector utilities \nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and \namortization \nEnvironment Management Group \nenvironmental management system \nenvironmental management plan \nenvironmental policy and environmental \nmanagement system \ninitial public offering \nInternational Organization for Standardization \nLondon interbank offered rate \nmillion metric standard cubic meters per day \nMinistry of Power \nNational Electricity Policy \nnormal cubic meters \nNational Thermal Power Corporation Limited or \n NTPC Limited \nplant load factor \npower purchase agreement \nReserve Bank of India \nstate electricity board \nstate electricity regulatory commission \nsuper thermal power project \ntransmission and distribution \ntripartite agreement \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n  \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "1,000,000 kilowatt \n1,000,000 kilowatt-hours \n1,000 meters \n1,000 watt-hours \n1,000 volts \n1,000,000 watts \n", " \n", " \n", "GW (gigawatt) \nGWh (gigawatt-hour) \nkm (kilometer) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nkV (kilovolt) \n \nMW (megawatt)   \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of NTPC and the Government of India ends on 31 March.
