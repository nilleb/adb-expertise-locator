An \nAssessment  initial environmental examination was completed for the category \nB project. An environmental assessment review framework was \ncompleted  to  guide  candidate  subprojects.  No  category  A \nsubprojects will be financed. \n   \nProject Description  The Power Sector Expansion Project comprises (i) support to the \nElectric Power Corporation\u2019s (EPC) investment plan 2008\u20132015 \nthrough three investment components and a project management \ncomponent,  and  (ii)  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster  for \nImplementing the Samoa National Energy Policy.  \n \nEPC\u2019s  investment  plan  2008\u20132015  comprises  a  series  of \nindividual  subproject  investments  in  power  generation  and \ntransmission.  The  three  investment  components  comprise  (i) \nComponent  A,  consisting  of  the  stage  1  expansion  and \nunderground cabling of the Hospital Feeder which forms part of \nEPC\u2019s underground cabling program for the transmission network \nto provide protection from cyclones, (ii) Component B, consisting \nof  the  supply  and  installation  of  single-  and  three-phase \nprepayment meters to improve EPC\u2019s collection performance and \nlay the foundation for effective demand-side management, and \n(iii)  Component  C,  consisting  of  17  candidate  subprojects \nincluding  11  transmission  projects,  four  generation  projects,  a \nsystem control and data acquisition project, and voltage, current, \nand  stream-flow-gauging  measurement  equipment.  The  project \nmanagement  component  (Component  D)  comprises  the \nrecruitment of a project manager and implementation consultants \nto build capacity and help implement EPC\u2019s investment plan.  \n    \nRationale  Reliable power supply is essential for enhancing the quality of life \nof  all  Samoans.  Good  performance  of  the  power  sector  and \nreliable electricity services are vital for promoting private sector \ninvestments  to  diversify  the  economy  and  achieve  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  The  performance  of  the  power  sector  is \nincreasingly  becoming  a  hindrance  to  economic  growth.  High \nsystem losses and voltage drops have resulted in poor reliability \nand quality of electricity supply. As a consequence, consumers \nare resorting to more expensive self-generation. \n ", "ii \n \nWith peak demand growing at about 3% annually in the medium \nterm, EPC\u2019s challenge is to improve its operational efficiency and \nfinancial  performance  while  ensuring  sufficient  generation  and \ntransmission capacity is available to provide a reliable and high \nquality electricity supply.  \n \nEPC\u2019s investment plan 2008\u20132015 is driven by (i) the need to \nimprove EPC\u2019s collection performance, (ii) the need to remove \ntransmission  bottlenecks  to  improve  reliability  and  quality  of \nsupply,  and  (iii)  capacity  requirements  to  meet  growing  peak \ndemands. In the longer term, the objective is to reduce Samoa\u2019s \nreliance on imported fuels by promoting clean, indigenous, and \nrenewable energy resources. \n \nAlthough Samoa\u2019s debt situation has significantly improved, the \neconomy  remains  import-dependent  and  vulnerable  to  climatic \nand global price shocks. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) \ngrant to the Government will ease the macroeconomic impact of \nthe large financing requirements in the power sector. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  forms  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector \ndevelopment plan to improve the capacity of the sector to provide \nsustainable and reliable electricity services to all consumers at \naffordable prices. To achieve this objective, the Project will help \nEPC to improve the quality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of \npower supply by (i) supporting EPC\u2019s investment plan to meet \ngrowing demand, (ii) improving the operational efficiency of EPC, \n(iii) improving the financial performance of EPC, (iv) establishing \neffective regulation of the power sector, (v) developing a demand-\nside  management  strategy  to  promote  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation, and (vi) developing clean energy resources through \nthe  establishment  of  a  clean  energy  fund  (CEF),  a  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM)  subfund,  and  a  designated \nnational authority (DNA).  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The project investment cost is estimated at $100 million, including \ntaxes and duties of $2.23 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan \nTotal \nSource  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank ADF Loan  26.61  26.61\nAsian Development Bank ADF Grant  15.39  15.39\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation  38.00  38.00\nGovernment of Australia  8.00  8.00\nElectric Power Corporation  12.00  12.00\n  Total    100.00  100.00\n     ADF = Asian Development Fund.  \n     Source: Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. \n \n ", "  iii\nAn ADF loan of $26.61 million and an ADF grant of $15.39 million \nto the Independent State of Samoa will help finance the Project. \nThe ADF loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years, and interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  financing  and  project  agreements.  The  ADF  grant  to  the \nGovernment  will  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  large \nfinancing requirements in the power sector.  \n \nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will provide \ncofinancing  of  $38  million  equivalent  in  Japanese  yen,  to  be \nadministered  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  for  the \nProject. The loan is expected to have a 30-year term, including a \ngrace period of 10 years, at an interest rate of 0.45%.  \n \nThe Government of Australia will provide grant cofinancing of $8 \nmillion. The grant is to be administered by ADB and is to be \nprovided as Government of Samoa equity to EPC for counterpart \nfinancing of the Project, with terms and conditions set forth in the \nfinancing and subsidiary financing agreements.   \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The ADF loan, the ADF grant, and the JBIC loan will be relent by \nTerms  the Government to EPC. The relending will be based on such \nterms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  subsidiary  financing \nagreement between the Government and EPC.  Such terms and \nconditions  will  include  the  relending  to  be  released  in  two \ntranches, an interest rate of 6.5%, and such conditions set forth in \nthe  financing  agreement.  The  first  tranche,  which  will  finance \nsubprojects completed by 30 June 2012, will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace of period of 5 years. The second tranche, which \nwill finance the remaining subprojects, will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. \n \nThe Government will utilize the ADF grant by converting a portion \nof  the  EPC  loan  principal  to  grants  conditional  on  timely  and \nwithin-budget  implementation  of  subprojects.  The  interest \npayment  from  EPC  to  the  Government  on  the  ADF  grant  will \nprovide ongoing financing for a CEF and a CDM subfund to be \nestablished under the CEF. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2016 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2016 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  EPC  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  A  project  steering \nArrangements  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  for  interministerial \ncoordination  and  to  provide  overall  project  direction.  A project \nmanagement  committee  (PMC)  will  be  formed  within  EPC  to \nprovide  coordination  between  project  and  nonproject  activities. \nEPC will establish a project management unit (PMU), to be led by \n ", "iv \nan  externally  recruited  project  manager,  for  day-to-day \nmanagement and implementation of the Project. Implementation \nconsultants will be recruited to support the PMU.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of 8 years. Bid \ndocuments for core subprojects are under preparation such that \ncontracts can be awarded prior to loan effectiveness. Construction \nactivities are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2008. \n \nThe  eligibility  criteria,  project  preparation  requirements,  and \napproval  process  for  candidate  subprojects  have  been \nestablished.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  under  the  Project,  including  for  ADB,  JBIC, \nGovernment of Australia, and EPC financing, will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nADB\u2019s standard bid documents will be used for procuring ADB, \nJBIC, and Government of Australia financed goods and services. \nRequirement of environmental monitoring and management plans \nwill be reflected in all civil works bid and contract documents. A \nprocurement  plan  and  tentative  contract  packages  have  been \nprepared. International competitive bidding procedures will apply \nto major contracts for all subprojects. Shopping procedure will \napply to contract packages of less than $100,000.    \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for a project manager and \nproject implementation. Consultants will be selected and engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A project manager will be \nrecruited internationally as an individual for an initial period of 36 \nmonths in accordance with ADB procedures. \n \nA consultant firm will be engaged to provide 69 person-months of \ninternational consulting services over a period of 36 months for \nproject implementation. The firm will be recruited using quality-\nand cost-based selection procedures. Individual consultants may \nbe  recruited  for  specific  assignments  in  accordance  with  ADB \nprocedures.   \n   \nProject Benefits and  Inadequate  and  unreliable  power  supply  is  becoming  an \nBeneficiaries  increasing  hindrance  to  economic  growth  and  is  affecting  all \nconsumers in Samoa. The Project will help improve the quality \nand reliability of electricity services, meet growing demand, and \nreduce EPC\u2019s (and ultimately consumers\u2019) exposure to fluctuating \ninternational  fuel  prices.  Improvements  in  EPC\u2019s  financial  and \noperational performance will enhance cost-effectiveness of power \nsupply  and,  once  the  benefits  of  the  expansion  program  are \nrealized, reduce requirements for tariff increases.  \n ", "  v\nRegulatory reform and the establishment of a regulatory agency \nwill  help  balance  the  interests  of  all  sector  stakeholders  and \npromote  cost-effective  private  sector  participation  and \ntransparency in the power sector.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  EPC\u2019s investment plan and financing arrangements have been \nprepared  considering  the  impact  on  Samoa\u2019s  debt  and  EPC\u2019s \nability to service its debt to the Government. The ADF grant will \nease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  large  financing \nrequirements in the power sector. The Government of Australia \nwill provide a grant to be provided as Government of Samoa \nequity to EPC. This equity will enable EPC to meet its counterpart \nfinancing requirements for the Project. \n \nPolitical  commitment  to  implementing  power  sector  reforms  is \nneeded for improving the performance of the sector, to ensure \nthat EPC can repay its debt to the Government, and to ensure \nthat investments translate into benefits for electricity consumers. \nThe TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa Energy Policy will \nassist the Government in (i) the consultation process, (ii) drafting \nand  amending  legislation,  and  (iii)  establishing  the  regulatory \nagency. Assurances under the Project reflect the key milestones \nfor regulatory reform. \n \nThe  selection  and  sequencing  of  subprojects  under  the \ninvestment  plan  has  been  prepared  in  consideration  of EPC\u2019s \nfinancial and implementation capacity. To ensure affordability of \nthe investment plan to EPC, timely adjustments to tariffs need to \nbe made in response to changes in EPC\u2019s costs. Until a formal \ntariff  mechanism  can  be  established  within  the  context  of  the \nregulatory  framework,  the  Government  has  introduced  a  fuel \nsurcharge that allows EPC to pass on fluctuating fuel costs. To \naddress  EPC\u2019s  poor  collection  performance,  arrears  by \ngovernment ministries and state-owned entities will be cleared \nprior  to  loan  effectiveness,  and  prepayment  metering  will  be \ninstalled for EPC\u2019s consumers. In the case of certain basic social \nservices  where  suspending  electricity  services  may  not  be \npossible, budgetary allocations will be paid directly to EPC for \nelectricity consumption. The assurances under the Project include \nthe provision that 75% of all consumers will have prepayment \nmeters by the end of 2012. \n \nDraft bid documents have been prepared to help ensure timely \nimplementation  for  core  subprojects.  Approval  of  advance \nprocurement action will help ensure that construction activities \ncan  commence  to  meet  scheduled  commissioning  targets. \nAdvance recruitment of the project manager and implementation \nconsultants will help mitigate EPC\u2019s capacity constraints in project \npreparation and procurement activities. To the extent possible, \nEPC  will  apply  plant  design,  supply,  and  install  contracts  to \nreduce the burden of coordination of construction activities.    \n ", "vi \n   \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  National  Energy \nPolicy  comprises  four  components.  Component  1  will  help \npromote  renewable  energy  resources  through  (i)  the \nestablishment of a CEF and a CDM subfund to be established \nunder the CEF, (ii) identifying a project pipeline, (iii) increasing \npublic  awareness  on  clean  and  renewable  energy,  and  (iv) \nproviding initial capitalization. Component 2 will establish capacity \nbuilding for the DNA to enable Samoa to benefit from the CDM. \nComponent 3 comprises support for regulatory and policy reforms \nin the power sector. Component 4 will provide resident financial \nmanagement  advisors  to  help  EPC  (i)  improve  planning;  (ii) \nensure  that  investments  are  affordable  and  contribute  to \nimproving  financial  sustainability;  and  (iii)  improve  the \ntransparency  of  costs,  tariff  setting,  and  accountability  to  the \nGovernment and consumers.   \n \n ", " \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan; (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Independent State of Samoa for the Power Sector \nExpansion  Project;  (iii)  the  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  from  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC); (iv) following approval by the Government of Australia, the \nproposed administration of a grant from the Government of Australia; and (v) following approval \nby the Government of Australia, the proposed administration of a conditional grant from the \nGovernment of Australia under a loan buy down mechanism for a portion of the loan. The report \nalso  describes  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa \nNational Energy Policy, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (i) \nproviding a portion of the technical assistance, and (ii) administering the balance of the technical \nassistance financed by the Government of Australia and the Government of Finland.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Despite  vulnerabilities  to  external  factors,  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  has \nexperienced stable economic growth over the last 5 years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrew at around 4% per annum, well above the average growth rate of the Pacific region \neconomies.  Economic  growth  is  mainly  driven  by  agriculture,  construction,  finance,  and \nbusiness services. Samoa is also benefiting from an increase in tourism. Further broadening of \neconomic  activity  and  private  sector  development  are  key  strategies  towards  sustaining \neconomic growth rates and reducing poverty. The Government\u2019s Strategy for the Development \nof Samoa 2005\u20132007 lays the foundation for sustainable and broad-based economic growth \nsupported by continued reforms and private sector development to improve the quality of life for \nall people in Samoa. Ensuring that sufficient power is available to meet growing demand is \nessential to achieving a broader economic base and reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to \nexternal shocks. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  The energy sector in Samoa has undergone rapid transformation over the last decade \ntowards having an energy supply based on imported petroleum and hydropower-generated \nelectricity.  This  transformation  has  been  driven  by  economic  growth  that  has  resulted  in \nincreasing demand for electricity and transportation. Energy demand in Samoa is met by three \nmain sources: biomass (47%), fossil fuel (45%), and hydropower (8%). Biomass is mainly used \nfor cooking, whereas imported petroleum is used for transportation and power generation. \nImports of petroleum products account for 15% of Samoa\u2019s total import expenditure. Power \ngeneration accounts for about 20% of total imported petroleum. \n \n4.  The Energy Unit of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has the overall responsibility for policy \nand strategic planning for the power sector. In the absence of an electricity act, the Electric \nPower Corporation (EPC) Act (1980) and the Public Bodies Act (2001) govern the power sector. \nUnder  the  provisions  of  the  EPC  Act,  the  Licensing  Committee  is  responsible  for  issuing \nlicensing for electrical works, generation, and distribution of electricity. \n \n5.  EPC, a wholly owned government corporation established in 1972, is vested with all \noperating responsibilities for the power sector. The EPC Act (1980) mandates EPC with the \nauthority for generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity throughout Samoa. The \nutility operates as a separate entity and is defined as a public trading body under the Public \n ", "2     \nBodies Act (2001), with the principal objective of operating as a commercial business. The State \nOwned Enterprise Monitoring Division is mandated with monitoring the financial performance of \nEPC. EPC is governed by a board of directors, the composition of which is specified in the EPC \nAct. EPC has 482 employees and services about 29,800 consumers throughout Samoa. With \nthe rural electrification program nearing completion, about 95% of the population has access to \nelectricity. The average household consumption is 76 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month.  \n \n6.  EPC\u2019s power system comprises a grid each on Upolu and Savai\u2019i islands, which together \naccount for nearly all energy sales, and small stand-alone solar and diesel generation schemes \non two isolated islands. The total installed capacity of EPC is 37.2 megawatts (MW), including \n24.7 MW of diesel generation. However, available and firm capacity is significantly less.  \n \n7.  The generation on Upolu, which accounts for 90% of EPC\u2019s total generation, comes from \na  mix  of  diesel  and  hydropower  stations.  The  main  power  station  on  Upolu  is  located  at \nTanugamanono and has five diesel generation units with a combined available generation \ncapacity of 17.9 MW. One of the units is kept on standby and is scheduled for retirement in \n2009. The load factor is about 66% and the average fuel efficiency is 4 kWh per liter (l). Of the \n12.5 MW of hydropower generation capacity, 6.7 MW is firm, and 4.0 MW of this comes from \nthe Afulilo storage hydropower scheme on Upolu. The remaining hydropower capacity comes \nfrom four run-of-the-river schemes on Upolu, one of which is scheduled for retirement in 2009 \nunless  refurbished.  The  run-of-the-river  hydropower  schemes  suffer  from  large  output \nreductions during the dry season, resulting in significant reductions in available energy. The \ntotal energy produced in 2006 was 101.0 gigawatt-hours (GWh).  \n \n8.  Power is distributed from the power stations via 22 kilovolts (kV) and 6.6 kV radial \ntransmission lines. Along these transmission lines, transformers step the voltage down to supply \nlocal demand. The overall system losses on Upolu were estimated at 19.2% of energy produced \nin 2006. Overloading of the existing Hospital Feeder, which carries 70% of energy sold on \nUpolu, contributes significantly to the high system losses and voltage drops.  \n \n9.  Savai\u2019i has one operational diesel power station located at Salalologa. The power station \nhas  six  secondhand  generation  units  with  a  combined  available capacity  of  5.2  MW.  The \nestimated load factor is 41% and the total energy produced is 11.1 GWh. Fuel efficiency is \nestimated at 3.3 kWh per l. Power is distributed via 22 kV transmission lines with step-down \ntransformers  and  a  low  voltage  network  to  supply  local  demand.  The  transmission  and \ndistribution system losses were estimated at 21.4% in 2006. \n \n10.  In 2006, peak electricity demands reached 17.6 MW on Upolu and 3.0 MW on Savai\u2019i. \nWith a peaking factor1 of 1.5 on Upolu, about 20.5 MW can be met reliably. With peak demand \n(cid:31)F\non Upolu growing by 7.3% in the very near term and by 4% beyond 2009, a shortfall of 0.3 MW \nis expected in 2008. By 2011, this shortfall will have increased to 5 MW unless additional \ngeneration capacity is installed. In terms of annual energy, the existing capacity can meet \nrequirements until 2013 when a 1.3 GWh shortfall is predicted. This shortfall will increase to \n25.7 GWh by 2020. Some of the existing capacity from self-generation (estimated to be about 8 \nMW) could be used to reduce peak system requirements in the short term. On Savai\u2019i, the \nexisting diesel power station is estimated to meet capacity and annual energy requirements \nassuming appropriate operations and maintenance of the existing generation units. \n \n                                                 \n1  Calculated as peak power demand divided by average power demand. \n ", "  3     \n11.  An automatic tariff adjustment mechanism was approved in 2001 but has never been \nimplemented. Instead, tariff submissions are made to cabinet, which regulates and approves \nelectricity tariffs. Before the 15% increase in May 2005, tariffs had remained constant since \n2001. A simplified tariff structure, which became effective in February 2007, allows for a fuel \nsurcharge of 15%, subject to review by cabinet every 6 months. For 2007 this implies a 14% \nincrease  in  average  tariffs.  The  highest  tariff  category  for  domestic  consumers  has  been \nabolished and a single tariff applies to all nondomestic consumers. The average tariff for 2007 is \nestimated  at  ST0.712  ($0.26)  per  kWh  overall  and  ST0.62  ($0.23)  per  kWh  for  domestic \nconsumers. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Power Sector Priorities \n12.  The  overarching  goal  for  the  power  sector  is  to  provide  sustainable  and  reliable \nelectricity services to all consumers at affordable prices. Developing indigenous and renewable \nenergy resources to reduce the economy\u2019s risk exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and \nfuel price increases is a high development priority for Samoa and is articulated in the Strategy \nfor the Development of Samoa. Consistent with this goal, the Samoa National Energy Policy \n(2007) identifies the development of renewable energy resources and the promotion of energy \nefficiency and conservation for end users as vital to achieving a sustainable energy sector. \nLikewise,  EPC\u2019s  Corporate  Plan  2007  identifies  the  provision  of  reliable  and  affordable \nelectricity services as the vision for the corporation, and the development of renewable energy \nresources as a key longer-term objective. Development of hydropower and other renewable \nresources will help to replace fuel-generated power and reduce EPC\u2019s exposure to foreign \nexchange fluctuations and fuel price increases. The power sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  While the development of indigenous and renewable energy sources is important for \nrealizing  the  priorities  for  the  energy  sector,  socially  acceptable,  technically  feasible,  and \naffordable renewable energy resources for power generation are limited in Samoa. Recent \nexperience from a consultation process for hydropower development on Savai\u2019i shows that \ncommunity concerns and, sometimes, misconceptions of the impacts, can be a constraining \nfactor.  With  the  transport  sector  absorbing  80%  of  imported  petroleum,  it  is  evident  that \nmeasures for energy conservation and development of alternative energy resources must cover \nthe energy sector as a whole. To address the priorities for the energy sector, the Government \nwill establish a clean energy fund (CEF) and a designated national authority (DNA) to promote \nrenewable energy development and energy conservation, and examine policy measures in \nsupport of energy conservation covering the energy sector as a whole.  \n \n14.  EPC is currently utilizing existing self-generation capacity on an as-needs basis. In the \nshort term, EPC plans to continue to use self-generation on a standby basis to meet peak \ndemand  requirements  during  the  dry  season.  The  priority  is  to  upgrade  the  transmission \ncapacity to (i) improve utilization of existing generation plants, (ii) reduce system losses, (iii) \nimprove reliability and security of supply to the main industrial and commercial consumers, and \n(iv) address the overloading on the existing underground transmission line to the hospital. \nConsistent with the priorities outlined in the Government\u2019s National Adaptation Program of \nAction (2005), EPC aims to reduce the exposure of its transmission network to cyclones through \nunderground cabling of selected transmission lines. The underground cabling program, which is \nincluded in EPC\u2019s investment plan 2008\u20132015, comprises five subprojects: (i) the Hospital \nFeeder upgrading project \u2013 Stage 1, (ii) Upolu diesel power station to Fuluasou Substation 22 \nkV underground cable project, (iii) Hospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 Stage 2, (iv) Fuluasou \n ", "4     \nSubstation to Apia Wharf area 22 kV underground cable project, and (v) Fuluasou Substation to \nLaulumauga via Vaigaga 22 kV underground cable project.  \n \n15.  Unpredictable long-term financing for needed investments is a key factor constraining \nEPC\u2019s  efforts  to  move  away  from  reactive  management  to  more  proactive  planning, \nmaintenance, and customer relations. EPC is increasingly placing emphasis on planning, but \nboth technical and financial capacity for long-term investment planning is constrained. With \ntechnical  assistance  from  ADB, 2 EPC  developed  an  investment  plan  for  generation  and \n(cid:31)F\ntransmission investments for the period 2008\u20132015. EPC\u2019s investment plan, which considers \nthe  capacity  of  EPC  to  manage  project  implementation  and  the  affordability  of  capital \ninvestments, is detailed in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  In the short term, EPC\u2019s investment requirements for generation are driven by growing \npeak  demand.  To  reduce  investment  requirements,  which  may  unduly  burden  the  utility\u2019s \nfinancial  position,  EPC  has  identified  the  need  for  demand-side  management  measures, \nincluding  the  introduction  of  bulk  power  purchase  agreements  with  large  consumers  that \nencourage off-peak consumption. To ensure that demand-side management measures for all \nconsumers are effective, installation of prepayment meters is included as a core subproject in \nEPC\u2019s investment plan.  \n \n17.  Appropriate  arrangements  for  tariff  setting,  technical  regulation,  and  private  sector \nparticipation are becoming increasingly important to improving the performance of the power \nsector in Samoa. The Government has recognized that the existing arrangements are a key \ndevelopment  constraint  for  the  power  sector  and  is  considering  reforms  to  improve  the \nperformance of the sector and encourage cost-effective private sector participation. Discussions \non regulatory options for the power sector have been taking place through a TA project provided \nby ADB (footnote 2). These discussions have focused on the need for an electricity act to \ngovern all stakeholders in the power sector in Samoa, and for a regulatory agency3 to be \n(cid:31)F\nestablished  to  (i)  remove  existing  regulatory  functions  from  EPC,  (ii)  provide  appropriate \narrangements for tariff setting, and (iii) enable private sector participation to reduce public sector \ninvestment requirements and promote least-cost generation to meet growing electricity demand.  \n \n2.  EPC\u2019s Financial Performance and Management \n18.  Over  the  past  6  years,  EPC  has  struggled  to  improve  its  financial  performance  to \nsatisfactory levels. Due largely to inadequate tariff levels and poor collections performance, \nEPC has been unable to meet its debt service obligations and still fund capital investments. \nEPC\u2019s financial performance gradually improved up to FY2004, before weakening again in \nFY2005, primarily because of higher fuel prices. Although tariffs were increased by 15% in May \n2005 and a fuel surcharge was introduced in February 2007, these were not sufficient to fully \noffset higher fuel costs. The impact of tariff increases and the fuel surcharge has been limited by \nEPC\u2019s inability to significantly improve its collections performance. The collections performance \nhas progressively deteriorated over the past 6 years and is a major factor adversely affecting \nnet cash flows. Government entities account for a disproportionate share of EPC\u2019s arrears from \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Preparing the Power Sector Expansion \nProgram. Manila. \n3  The Government is considering establishing an independent regulatory agency for the power sector alone (a single \nsector regulator) or mandate a regulatory agency to cover multiple infrastructure sectors (a multisector regulator). A \nmultisector  regulator  would  expand  the  roles  and  function  of  the  existing  independent  regulator  for  the \ntelecommunications sector. \n ", "  5     \nelectricity sales. While electricity sales to government entities account for 11% of total sales, \nthey account for 55% of existing total arrears.  \n \n19.  To ensure timely tariff adjustments in response to changes in EPC costs, there is a need \nto establish a formal mechanism for determining tariffs within the context of an overall regulatory \nframework for the electricity sector. This is particularly important during the growing daily peak \nin demand when EPC relies most heavily on expensive diesel generation.  \n \n20.  Over the past 2 years, EPC has taken measures to improve its collections. It has begun \nto introduce prepayment metering and has so far installed 1,200 meters, primarily for domestic \ncustomers and small businesses. The investment plan will extend prepayment metering to all \nEPC customers, including three-phase meters for government ministries and entities and private \nsector consumers. In the case of government-defined basic social services (such as hospitals \nand  health  clinics)  where  suspending  electricity  service  may  not  be  possible,  budgetary \nallocations will be paid directly to EPC for electricity consumption. EPC has begun requiring full \nupfront payment for most rechargeable works, although some exceptions to this policy remain. \nThe EPC board has also recently approved policies on consistent application of debt write-offs \nand disconnections. The financial performance and projections of EPC is in Appendix 4.  \n \n21.  A financial management assessment of EPC\u2019s internal controls and accounting and \naudit procedures was undertaken. EPC\u2019s financial management practices and procedures are \nconsidered to be generally adequate for both the construction and operational phases of the \nProject. The project management unit (PMU) established within EPC will be responsible for \nproject financial management and accounting. The PMU will utilize EPC\u2019s existing financial \nmanagement and accounting systems in undertaking these functions. EPC\u2019s accounts and \nreporting structures are based on international financial reporting standards. \n \n22.  EPC\u2019s financial statements are audited by a firm of external auditors on behalf of the \nGovernment\u2019s Audit Office. Over the period assessed (FY2002\u2013FY2006), the auditor issued an \nunqualified opinion, meaning that the financial statements were deemed to provide a true and \nfair view of the financial position of EPC. However, ADB\u2019s financial management assessment \nidentified certain deficiencies in these statements, which indicate weaknesses in the external \nauditing  process.  To  address  these  deficiencies,  resident  financial  management  advisors \n(RFMAs) will provide ongoing support for improving internal budgeting and expenditure controls, \nconsolidating  accounts,  and  financial  reporting  and  forecasts  to  the  EPC  board,  the \nGovernment, and ADB. \n \n3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n23.  ADB has been involved in the power sector in Samoa since 1971 with the provision of an \ninitial TA project which was instrumental in the establishment of EPC in 1972. ADB has assisted \nthe development of the power sector in Samoa through seven previous loans, amounting to \n$21.05  million,  and  14  TA  projects,  amounting  to  $3.013  million.  The  most  recent  loan, \napproved  in  2001,  was  cancelled  in  2006. 4 A  number  of  other  donors  and  multilateral \n(cid:31)F\ndevelopment banks have been active in the power sector, including the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID), European Investment Bank, Global Environment Facility \n(GEF),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP), and the World Bank. The external assistance to the power sector is in Appendix 5.    \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIndependent State of Samoa for the Power Sector Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1886-SAM). \n ", "6     \n \n4.  Lessons  \n \n24.  A number of lessons have emerged from ADB\u2019s support to the power sector in Samoa. \nCost  overruns  have  historically  been  related  to  delays  in  implementation.  Deferred  loan \neffectiveness and technical and procurement aspects have been the major contributing factors \nto delays in project implementation. \n \n25.  Preparation of accurate cost estimates is a difficult task for infrastructure projects in \nSamoa given the country\u2019s reliance on international markets, particularly for civil works contracts \nin Australia and New Zealand. Physical contingencies need to be sufficient to allow for technical \nuncertainties and the selection of procurement methods must consider the capacity to manage \nand coordinate contracts, and the ability to attract sufficient qualified bidders.  \n \n26.  Samoa has experienced cost overruns on a majority of infrastructure projects funded by \nADB and the World Bank. Cost overruns in the power sector have resulted in either a reduction \nin the project scope or a request for supplementary financing. These requests have been \nassociated with delays that have led to further cost increases because of the need to extend \nbids. ADB review missions concluded that a sector loan modality would add flexibility and help \navoid delays associated with supplementary loan processing.  \n \n27.  In general, EPC has complied with covenants related to ADB\u2019s safeguards. However, \nEPC\u2019s compliance with financial performance covenants has been very limited in prior loans. In \n2005, ADB undertook a comprehensive assessment of EPC\u2019s financial performance which \nconcluded that the covenants needed to be refined to achieve a strong focus on cash flows. In \naddition,  reporting  requirements  to  the  EPC  board  and  the  Government  for  covenant \ncompliance need to be in place to support desirable outcomes. Covenants compliance also \nneeds to be supported by targeted capacity building to address identified weaknesses and by \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government during implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.  The unreliable and poor quality electricity supply is affecting all consumer groups and is \nbecoming an increasing constraint to private sector development and economic growth. The \npower sector expansion project has been identified to support the Government\u2019s overarching \nobjective of providing sustainable and reliable electricity services to all consumers at affordable \nprices. To achieve this objective, the Project will help EPC to improve the quality, reliability, and \ncost-effectiveness of power supply.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  The Project forms part of the Government\u2019s power sector development plan to improve \nthe capacity of the sector to meet growing electricity demand and improve quality, reliability, and \ncost-effectiveness of power supply by (i) supporting EPC\u2019s investment plan to meet growing \ndemand,  (ii)  improving  the  operational  efficiency  of  EPC,  (iii)  improving  the  financial \nperformance of EPC, (iv) establishing effective regulation of the power sector, (v) developing a \ndemand-side management strategy to promote energy efficiency and conservation; and (vi) \ndeveloping clean energy resources through the establishment of a CEF, a clean development \nmechanism (CDM) subfund, and a DNA.   \n ", "  7     \n \n30.  EPC\u2019s investment plan for 2008\u20132015 will meet forecasted demand requirements up \nuntil 2019 when new capacity will be required on Upolu, and help EPC improve its collection \nperformance through the installation of prepayment meters. The investment plan comprises (i) \nfour generation projects, (ii) 11 transmission projects, (iii) single- and three-phase prepayment \nmetering,  (iv)  a  system  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  project,  and  (v)  portable \nequipment for measuring voltage and current and stream-flow gauging. Increased transmission \ncapacity on Upolu and the installation of prepayment meters have been prioritized to improve \nEPC's  collection  performance  and  provide  the  foundation  for  effective  demand-side \nmanagement measures. The capacity of the transmission network will be increased to (i) reduce \nsystem losses, (ii) improve reliability and quality of supply to the main business and commercial \nload center in Apia, and (iii) reduce the load on the existing underground transmission line to the \nhospital. EPC will reduce the vulnerability of its transmission network through underground \ncabling of selected transmission lines. Investments in generation are prioritized to meet growing \npeak demand and replace diesel-generated power. Increased generation capacity on Upolu will \nbe required in 2010 and a mini-hydropower project on Savai\u2019i is scheduled for commissioning in \n2014.     \n \n31.  The SCADA and equipment for measuring voltage and current will help EPC improve its \noperational efficiency through (i) improved system controls and monitoring, (ii) benchmarking of \nstandard industry performance indicators, and (iii) enabling targeted loss reduction measures.  \n \n32.  The investment comprises the following components. \n \n(i)  Component A: Hospital Feeder Upgrading Project \u2013 Stage 1. The project \nforms part of EPC\u2019s underground cabling program for the transmission network to \nprovide protection from cyclones. The project, which is the first stage of the two-\nstage upgrading and underground cabling of the Hospital Feeder, will relieve the \noverloaded Hospital Feeder by transferring the town center and Mulinuu Point \nbranches to the underutilized Vaitele Feeder. A 22 kV underground cable with a \nlength of 900 meters (m) will be constructed and replace the existing 6.6 kV \ntransmission line overhead section from Togafuafua to Saleufi. The project will \nimprove utilization of the existing Vaitele Feeder and improve reliability of supply \nto  the  central  business  and  parliamentary  area,  and  to  the  hospital.  The \nTanugamanono Power Station will be reinforced by installation of a new 6.6 kV \n22 kV transformer to support the 22 kV underground cable, and nine new 22 kV \n400  volts  (V)  distribution  transformers  to  replace  the  existing  6.6  kV  400  V \ntransformers. \n \n(ii)  Component B: Single- and Three-Phase Prepayment Metering Project. This \ncomponent  involves  the  supply  and  installation  of  21,000  single-phase  (10 \namperes [A]\u2013100 A);  200 three-phase prepayment meters (10 A\u2013160 A); and 50 \nthree-phase current transformer prepayment meters (160 A\u2013800 A)  on Upolu \nand Savai\u2019i commencing in 2008. EPC plans to have prepayment meters for at \nleast 75% of its consumers installed by the end of 2012. The Project will improve \nEPC\u2019s collection performance and lay the foundation for effective demand-side \nmanagement. \n \n(iii)  Component C: candidate subprojects. Candidate subprojects comprise three \ngeneration and eight transmission subprojects on Upolu  and one generation \n ", "8     \nproject and three transmission subprojects on Savai\u2019i. The SCADA system and \nmeasurement equipment will cover the power systems on both islands.  \n \n(iv)  Component D: project management. To ensure timely implementation, EPC \nhas established a PMU dedicated solely to the implementation of the investment \nplan.  An  externally  recruited  project  manager  and  international  project \nimplementation consultants will be appointed for an initial period of 3 years to \nassist the PMU, build capacity, and coordinate and implement the investment \nplan.  \n \n33.  The investment plan is accompanied by institutional and regulatory measures to improve \nthe financial and operational performance of EPC, and the overall performance of the power \nsector. EPC\u2019s collection performance will be improved through (i) the installation of prepayment \nmeters, (ii) consistent application of the disconnection policy, and (iii) improvements to financial \ncontrols. \n  \n34.   The TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy comprises four \ncomponents that aim to (i) help improve EPC\u2019s financial performance through the provision of \nRFMAs; (ii) develop a regulatory framework that will establish a regulatory agency to govern all \nstakeholders in the power sector; (iii) promote energy efficiency through the development of a \ndemand-side management and energy conservation strategy and public awareness campaign; \nand (iv) promote development of clean energy through the establishment of a CEF and CDM \nsubfund and by assisting the Government with enabling the environment for participation in \ncarbon-market trading through the establishment of, and capacity building for, the DNA.  \n \nC.  Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX Grant Component \n35.  The  proposed  ADF  grant  of  $15.39  million  to  the  Government  will  ease  the \nmacroeconomic impact of the large financing requirements for the power sector expansion \nproject. The Government will provide the grant to EPC as a loan on the same terms as the loan \nfrom ADB. The Government will utilize a portion of the grant as an incentive scheme for EPC for \ntimely  implementation  of  subprojects  under  the  investment  plan.  Upon  EPC  meeting  the \nscheduled commissioning dates for each of the subprojects, the Government will provide 7% of \nthe project cost as a grant to EPC, up to a ceiling of $10 million from 2008 to 2015. Projects \ncommissioned after 31 December 2015 will not be eligible under the grant incentive scheme. \nThe implementation schedule and commissioning dates for each of the candidate subprojects \nwill be approved by the project steering committee (PSC) at subproject approval stage prior to \nimplementation.  The  grant  incentive  scheme  will  help  improve  discipline  in  project \nimplementation such that the benefits of the investments will reach electricity consumers in a \ntimely manner.  \n \nD.  Special Features \n36.  Donor  Coordination. Donor coordination and consultations with AusAID, GEF, and \nJBIC have been key features of project preparation. Because of the emphasis on regulatory and \ngovernance aspects of the power sector in Samoa, the Government of Australia will help \nfinance the regulatory and policy reform component of the TA cluster for Implementing the \nSamoa National Energy Policy. Development of the feasible and affordable investment plan and \npolicy dialogue has been undertaken with EPC and the Government jointly with AusAID and \nJBIC. JBIC will provide joint cofinancing as the first project under the Accelerated Cofinancing \n ", "  9     \nScheme with ADB.5 The Government of Australia will provide a grant as joint cofinancing for the \n(cid:31)F\nProject to address affordability of counterpart financing requirements, which is a particular issue \nfor EPC in the early years of the investment plan. Initial consultations have been undertaken \nwith GEF on the CEF. The consultations will continue as part of the implementation of the \nestablishment of the CEF, the CDM subfund, and the DNA.   \n \n37.  Climate Change Adaptation. The Project supports the objectives of the Government\u2019s \nNational Adaptation Program of Action (2005) through the underground transmission network \ncabling program. The program will help to reduce exposure of transmission assets to cyclones \nand reduce the impacts to EPC and consumers of cyclone damage to the transmission network. \n \n38.  Power  Sector  Reform.  Investments  in  the  power  sector  will  be  accompanied  by \ninstitutional and regulatory reform to improve the financial and operational performance of EPC, \nand the overall performance of the power sector. Assistance to undertaking the reform process \nis provided through the TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy and is \nsupported by assurances under the financing agreement between ADB and the Government. \n \n39.  Macroeconomic  Sustainability.  The  provision  of  the  ADF  grant  will  ease  the \nmacroeconomic impact of the large financing requirements for the power sector expansion \nproject. In addition, the Government of Australia will provide $8 million to the Government for \ncounterpart financing of the Project.6 \n(cid:31)F\n \n40.  Financing Arrangements. The sector loan modality will help EPC to improve longer-\nterm  investment  planning  through  the  provision  of  predictable  financing.  The  sector  loan \nmodality will also help mitigate the risk of further delays associated with supplementary loan \nprocessing in the event of cost overruns. The Government utilization of a portion of the ADF \ngrant as an incentive scheme to EPC will help improve timely implementation of subprojects. \nThe Government will also utilize the interest rate payment from EPC on the grant to provide \nongoing financing of a CEF and a CDM subfund.  \n \n41.  Pilot Financing Approach to Reforms in Developing Countries. The Government of \nAustralia will provide a grant of A$4 million to the Government of Samoa to buy down a portion \nof the ADF loan. The loan buy down mechanism will be triggered by the Government achieving \nspecific  reform  measures  by  31  December  2012,  including  (i)  the  establishment  of  an \nindependent technical and price regulator for the power sector, (ii) EPC\u2019s collection performance \nimproving such that accounts receivable do not exceed 2 months of electricity sales for a \nminimum of 2 years, and (iii) 75% of all EPC\u2019s active electricity customers are using prepayment \nmeters.  The  use  of  this  pilot  mechanism  constitutes  an  innovative  approach  to  promoting \nreforms in developing countries, especially in the Pacific region. This is the first time that ADB is \nengaging in such a loan buy down mechanism. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n42.  The project investment cost is estimated at $100 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.23 million. The Project comprises two core investment subprojects, 17 candidate investment \nsubprojects under EPC\u2019s investment plan, and a project management component which will be \nimplemented  during  the  2008\u20132015  investment  period.  The  core  subprojects comprise  the \n                                                 \n5  The joint cofinancing framework agreement for the Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme with ADB was signed on 26 \nSeptember 2007. \n6  The $8 million will be disbursed over the 8-year investment plan and constitute the Government of Samoa\u2019s equity \nin EPC. \n ", "10    \nHospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 1, through the construction of a 22 kV underground \ncable from Togafuafua to Saleufi, and the supply and installation of single- and three-phase \nprepayment meters.

Financing Plan \n43.  The Government of Samoa has requested a loan of $26.61 million and a grant of $15.39 \nmillion from ADF to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the financing and project agreements. The \nbeneficiary will be the Independent State of Samoa. \n \n44.  The Government has requested a loan of $38 million equivalent in Japanese yen from \nJBIC for joint cofinancing of the Project, to be administered by ADB. The loan is expected to \nhave a 30-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, at an interest rate of 0.45%.   \n \n45.  The ADF loan, the ADF grant, and the JBIC loan will be provided to the Independent \nState of Samoa and then relent by the Government to EPC. The relending will be based on \nsuch  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  subsidiary  financing  agreement  between  the \nGovernment and EPC.  Such terms and conditions will include the relending to be released in \ntwo tranches, an interest rate of 6.5%, and such conditions set forth in the financing agreement. \nThe first tranche, which will finance subprojects completed by 30 June 2012, will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years. The second tranche, which will finance the remaining \nsubprojects, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. The Government will \n ", "  11     \nassume the foreign exchange risk arising from the ADB and JBIC loans. ADB and JBIC will \nfinance 80% of the estimated project costs. The Government of Australia will provide $8 million \nrepresenting 8% of the estimated project costs (as described more fully in paragraph 46 below). \nEPC will provide $12 million as counterpart financing, which represents 12% of the estimated \nproject costs. Table 2 presents the financing plan, and the detailed cost estimates by financier \nare detailed in Appendix 6 (Table A6.2). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank ADF Loan  26.61  26.61 \nAsian Development Bank ADF Grant  15.39  15.39 \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation  38.00  38.00 \nGovernment of Australia  8.00  8.00 \nElectric Power Corporation  12.00  12.00 \nTotal  100.00  100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n46.  The Government has requested a grant of $8 million from the Government of Australia to \nhelp finance the Project on a joint cofinancing basis. The grant will be provided as Government \nof Samoa equity to EPC for the purpose of meeting counterpart financing requirements of the \nProject, with terms and conditions set forth in the subsidiary financing agreement between the \nGovernment and EPC.  ADB typically seeks Board approval for the administration of grant funds \nfrom cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. In the case of the proposed \nGovernment of Australia grant, the cofinancing agreement between the Government of Australia \nand ADB will be entered into following Board approval of the Project. To avoid any Project \ndelay, the Board is requested to approve the administration of the proposed grant, in an amount \nnot exceeding $8 million, which is expected to be confirmed subsequent to the date of Board \napproval.  Approval  of  the  Government  of  Australia  grant  will  be  reported  to  the  Board  in \naccordance with the standard reporting procedures. If the Government of Australia does not \napprove grant financing, the Government may make alternative arrangements, satisfactory to \nADB, to cover the funding shortfall. \n \n47.  The  ADF  grant  of  $15.39  million will  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the large \nfinancing requirements for the Project. The grant will be relent to EPC on the same terms as the \nADB and JBIC loans. The interest payment from EPC to the Government on the grant portion \nwill provide ongoing financing for a CEF and a CDM subfund.7 MOF will provide annual reports \n(cid:31)F\nto ADB on the interest payment directed to the CEF and CDM subfund. The Government will \nutilize a portion of the grant as an incentive scheme for EPC for timely implementation of \nsubprojects under the investment plan. Seven percent of projects costs, or a maximum of $10 \nmillion of the EPC loan principal, can be converted to grants conditional on timely and to-budget \nimplementation of subprojects. MOF will report to ADB when EPC has met the conditions that \nwill trigger conversion to grants and advise of the amount of the loan principal to be converted \ninto grants to EPC. \n \n                                                 \n7  The TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy will assist in the establishment of a CEF and a \nCDM subfund.  \n ", "12    \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n48.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project  and  has  assigned  EPC  as  the \nimplementing agency. A PSC will be established to provide overall project direction.8 The chief \n(cid:31)F\nexecutive officer (CEO) of MOF will chair the PSC. Other PSC members comprise (i) the \ngeneral manager of EPC, (ii) the attorney general, and (iii) the CEOs of the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, the  \nSamoa Water Authority, and the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour. PSC meetings will \nbe convened on a quarterly basis commencing in October 2007. Special PSC meetings may be \nconvened to consider extraordinary project issues. A project management committee (PMC) will \nbe formed within EPC to provide coordination between project and nonproject activities. The \nPMC will be chaired by the general manager and comprise EPC management and the project \nmanager. The PMC will convene on a weekly basis commencing in October 2007. \n \n49.  EPC will establish a PMU for the day-to-day management and implementation of the \nproject. The PMU will be led by an externally recruited project manager who will be responsible \nfor the daily tasks associated with project delivery and control. The project manager will be \nengaged for an initial period of 3 years. The PMU will include personnel seconded from existing \nEPC staff resources or recruited specifically for the PMU. Project implementation consultants \nwill be recruited to provide technical support and on-the-job training for the PMU personnel over \nthe first 3 years of the Project. The PMU will be responsible for project planning, monitoring and \nreporting, and cost and quality control. The PMU will (i) undertake project management and \nadministration, (ii) plan and implement cost effective and sustainable infrastructure investments \nto meet consumer demand, (iii) maintain project accounts, (iv) oversee procurement procedures \nto ensure compliance with Government and ADB policies and procedures, (v) liaise with ADB \nfor quarterly project progress updates and other reporting and communication matters, and (vi) \nprepare the project completion report of the Government. The Government will ensure that, \nthroughout the project implementation period, EPC provides adequate allocations of counterpart \nfunds to ensure proper project implementation. EPC will provide adequate office space for the \nPMU and implementation consultants and ensure that the facilities provided are operated and \nmaintained appropriately.  \n \n2.  Candidate Subproject Preparation and Approval \n50.  Preparation. The PMU will identify candidate subprojects and obtain approval from the \nEPC board and MOF to assess the feasibility of the candidate subprojects. The PMU will \nprepare a feasibility study for each candidate subproject in accordance with the detail and \nquality  required  to  enable  ADB  to  assess  the  suitability  of  the  candidate  subproject.  The \nfeasibility study will contain evidence of the candidate subproject\u2019s eligibility under the agreed \ncriteria. The feasibility study will provide (i) technical analysis and description; (ii) subproject \nrationale, scope, and components; (iii) cost estimates and financing plan; (iv) implementation \narrangements; (v) an environmental assessment; and (vi) a land acquisition and resettlement \nassessment. The feasibility studies will include a set of relevant benchmark and performance \nindicators for the subproject which will be monitored through the progress reports. The feasibility \nstudy will also contain an update of EPC\u2019s investment plan and an analysis of the impacts on \nEPC\u2019s 5-year financial projections, key financial ratios, and compliance with loan covenants.  \n                                                 \n8  Similar PSCs are being used for overall strategic guidance and coordination for infrastructure projects funded by \nother international financing institutions. \n ", "  13     \n \n51.  Eligibility Criteria. The PSC, the EPC board, and ADB, in consultation with the PMU, \nwill appraise subprojects in accordance with the eligibility criteria and procedures outlined in \nAppendix 7. \n \n52.  Approval Process. Candidate subproject feasibility studies will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval. After ADB has endorsed the feasibility study, the PMU will submit the \nfeasibility study to the EPC board and the PSC for review and approval. Implementation of a \ncandidate subproject may only proceed following the endorsement of the candidate subproject \nfeasibility study by the PSC, the EPC board, and ADB. Civil works may only commence once \nthe land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) and initial environmental examinations (IEE) \nhave  been  approved  by  ADB,  and  the  development  concept  approval  of  the  Preliminary \nEnvironmental Assessment Report (PEAR) is issued by the Planning and Urban Management \nAgency (PUMA).  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n53.  The  PMU  will  be  established  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  Bid  documents  for  core \nsubprojects are under preparation such that construction activities can start in the first quarter of \n2008. The subprojects will be implemented over 8 years and are expected to be completed by \n31 December 2015. The project implementation schedule is detailed in Appendix 8.  \n \n4.  Procurement  \n54.  The equipment, materials, and works financed by the proceeds of the ADB loan and \ngrant, the JBIC loan, and the Government of Australia grant will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all contracts. ADB\u2019s \nbid documents will be used for procuring ADB, JBIC, and Government of Australia financed \ngoods  and  services.  Requirements  of  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plans \n(EMMP) will be reflected in all civil works bid and contract documents. The draft procurement \nplan outlines (i) the particular contracts for the goods and works; (ii) the proposed method for \nprocurement of goods and works financed by ADB, JBIC, and the Government of Australia; and \n(iii) the related ADB review procedures. EPC will update the procurement plan as needed for the \nduration of the Project. The procurement plan and contract packages are detailed in Appendix \n9.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n55.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  project  management,  (ii)  preparation  of \ncandidate subprojects, (iii) construction supervision, and (iv) contract management. Consultants \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A firm will be selected through international competition \nusing quality-and cost-based selection method to provide project implementation consulting \nservices. About 69 international person-months will be required for project implementation. \nIndividual consultants may be recruited for specific assignments in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures. The project manager will be recruited internationally as an individual for an initial \nperiod of 36 months in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures. The outline terms of reference for \nthe project manager and implementation consultants is in Supplementary Appendix A.   \n \n ", "14    \n56.  In response to EPC\u2019s request, ADB is providing assistance for the recruitment of the \nproject manager and implementation consultants. ADB is assisting in the selection processes on \nbehalf of EPC, which will be responsible for negotiating the contracts with the consultants and \nfor supervising the consultant\u2019s services. \n   \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n57.  The  Government  will  take  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  governance  and \ntransparency in the power sector. Strengthening the regulatory framework for the sector will \nprovide  segregation  between  EPC  and  regulatory  functions.  Accountability  to  sector \nstakeholders will be strengthened through public consultations and information, particularly with \nregards to tariffs and the cost of electricity supply. The consistent application of disconnections \nwill improve EPC\u2019s ability to provide reliable electricity supply to all consumers. Benchmarking \nwill improve awareness and transparency of EPC\u2019s technical and operational performance. \nStrengthening EPC\u2019s financial management capabilities and reporting through the provision of \nRFMAs9 will improve the Government\u2019s oversight of EPC.  \n(cid:31)F\n \n58.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  EPC  and  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  the  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of EPC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n59.  The proceeds from the ADF loan, the ADF grant, the JBIC loan, and the grant provided \nby the Government of Australia for the proposed Project will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government \nwill submit separate withdrawal applications for the ADF loan, ADF grant, JBIC loan, and the \nGovernment of Australia grant. To promote efficiency in processing disbursements from four \ndifferent  sources  under  the  Project,  a  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  set  at \n$100,000 equivalent or an amount determined to be a reasonable minimum.10 Reimbursement \n(cid:31)F\nand direct payment procedures will apply for consulting services, civil works, and equipment \nsupply  and  installation.  Reimbursement  procedures  will  apply  to  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. The disbursement and funding arrangements is in Appendix 10. \n \n8.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n60.  To  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  has  approved  advance \nprocurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  defined  contracts  of  core  subprojects  as \noutlined in the procurement plan and for procurement of consulting services. Up to 20% of loan \nproceeds are eligible for retroactive financing. Retroactive financing is applicable to eligible \nexpenditures, which must have been incurred before loan effectiveness, but generally no earlier \n                                                 \n9  The RFMAs will be provided through the TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy.  \n10 The minimum value per withdrawal for consulting services is set at $30,000 equivalent or an amount determined to \nbe a reasonable minimum. \n ", "  15     \nthan 12 months before signing of the financing and project agreements. The Government and \nEPC have been advised that approval of advance procurement action and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB, JBIC, and the Government of Australia to financing the Project.  \n  \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n61.  EPC will continue to engage independent auditors acceptable to ADB to audit its annual \nfinancial statements and annual project accounts. The scope of work for the auditors will be \nextended to include audit of EPC\u2019s compliance with ADB\u2019s financial loan covenants. Audit \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  together  with  the  respective  financial  reports  and  the \nmemorandum of issues identified during the audit process. Annual financial reports will be \nprepared using international financial reporting standards, and audits will be conducted using \ninternational standards on auditing. EPC will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within \n6 months of the end of the financial year, EPC will submit annual audited project accounts and \nannual audited financial statements of EPC. The annual financial statements, which will be \nconsolidated for all of EPC\u2019s operations, will record equity contributions by the Government of \nSamoa.11 By 28 February each year (commencing 28 February 2008), EPC will also prepare \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand  provide  ADB  5-year  financial  projections  in  a  form  agreed  with  ADB.  The  financial \nprojections will reflect updates in EPC\u2019s investment plan. \n \n62.  EPC will submit quarterly progress reports for individual subprojects to ADB. These \nreports will include a description of (i) the physical progress of the subproject; (ii) any difficulties \nencountered and or anticipated along with corrective actions; (iii) the implementation progress \non the land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF), environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF), and subproject IEE\u2019s and EMMPs as applicable; (iv) the reasons for \nany delays in project implementation and recommendations for corrective actions; and (v) the \nsummary of financial accounts comprising project expenditures during the previous quarter, \nyear to date, and total to date. The quarterly progress reports will also include key performance \nand  benchmark  indicators  as  identified  in  the  approved  subproject  feasibility  studies.  As \nneeded, the progress reports will include updates of the procurement plan. EPC will submit \nsubproject  completion  reports  within  3  months  of  subproject  completion.  The  subproject \ncompletion  report  will  (i)  provide  an  assessment  of  the  execution  and  operation  of  the \nsubproject, (ii) provide the status of compliance with loan covenants, and (iii) include results on \nsubproject outcomes and performance.  \n \n63.  MOF will provide annual reports to ADB on the interest payment from the relent grant to \nEPC directed to the CEF and CDM subfund. MOF will report to ADB when EPC has met \nconditions for the grant incentive scheme and advise as to the amount of the loan principal to be \nconverted into grants to EPC. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n64.  EPC will establish a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) to facilitate the \nreporting requirements. The PPMS will assess progress and implementation of the Project, \nincluding (i) resettlement activities, (ii) compliance with the EARF and subproject EMMPs, and \n(iii)  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  covenants.  The  PPMS  will  also  monitor  the  operational \nefficiency and financial position and projections of EPC to enable benchmarking against other \nutilities.   \n                                                 \n11  Recorded equity contributions will include annual disbursed amounts of the $8 million grant from the Government \nof Australia.   \n ", "16    \n \n11.  Project Review \n65.  ADB will undertake an inception mission 1 month after loan effectiveness or 1 month \nafter fielding of project implementation consultants, whichever is later. Review missions will be \nundertaken at 6-monthly intervals (starting 6 months after the inception mission) for the initial 3 \nyears of the Project. The review missions will include an evaluation of (i) project scope and \ncosts; (ii) implementation arrangements; (iii) progress in implementing the LARF, EARF, and \nsubproject IEEs and EMMPs as applicable; and (iv) achievement of scheduled targets and \nidentification of project risks. The review missions will also undertake ongoing policy dialogue on \n(i) EPC\u2019s operational efficiency and financial performance, (ii) the Government\u2019s progress on \npower sector reforms, and (iii) compliance with loan covenants. ADB will field a midterm review \n4 years after loan effectiveness.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n66.  The TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy forms part of the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector development plan to improve access to sustainable and reliable \nelectricity services to all consumers in Samoa. The TA cluster will (i) promote the development \nof clean energy resources in Samoa through the establishment of a CEF; (ii) enable Samoa to \nparticipate  in,  and  benefit  from,  carbon-market  trading  through  the  establishment  of,  and \ncapacity building for, the DNA; (iii) develop effective regulation of the power sector and promote \ndemand-side management and energy conservation through support to regulatory and policy \nreform in the power sector; and (iv) help improve EPC\u2019s financial performance through the \nprovision of RFMAs. The TA cluster is described in Appendix 11 and detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n67.  The Power Sector Expansion Project will help provide sustainable and reliable electricity \nservices  to  all  consumers  in  Samoa.  The  unreliable  and  poor  quality  electricity  supply  is \naffecting  all  consumers  and  is  becoming  an increasing constraint  to  the  expansion  of  the \ntourism industry and economic growth. Once the benefits of the investment plan have been \nrealized,  improvements  in  power  supply  cost  effectiveness  will  reduce  the  need  for  tariff \nincreases.  \n \n68.  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan  for  2008\u20132015  comprises  a  series  of  individual  subproject \ninvestments in generation and transmission which will improve the quality and reliability of \nelectricity supply and meet forecast demand on Upolu and Savai\u2019i. The investment plan is \naccompanied by institutional and power sector reform measures to ensure that project benefits \nwill reach all electricity consumers in Samoa.  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n69.  As subprojects included under the investment plan are not stand-alone investments that \nyield benefits in isolation from other investments in the power sector, the economic and financial \nanalyses were undertaken using a time-slice approach for EPC\u2019s two power systems on Upolu \nand Savai\u2019i. The analyses are conducted for 23 years, including the investment period of 8 \nyears. Oil prices were assumed to be constant at $60 per barrel (bbl) throughout the period of \nanalysis. Estimated annual CDM credits of $45,000 for the Savai\u2019i hydropower project were \nincluded in the analyses. The economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n ", "  17     \n \n70.  Least-cost analyses were undertaken for the underground cabling program on Upolu \nand for the hydropower project on Savai\u2019i. Under conservative assumptions on the cost of \ncyclone damage to the transmission lines, it would take about two cyclones for the underground \ncabling program to become least-cost. During the first year of full operation, the hydropower \nproject on Savai\u2019i would replace 96% of generation by the existing diesel power station at \nSalelologa. With demand growth, this percentage will drop to 75% by 2020. The results show \nthat the hydropower project is least-cost if the average oil price over the period of analysis \nexceeds $53.50 per bbl.    \n \n71.  In the absence of an investment plan on Upolu, the economic analysis assumes that \nEPC would serve demand from its existing generation capacity. Unserved demand initially \nrepresents  deficits  in  peak  capacity.  The  transmission  system  will  increasingly  become  a \nbottleneck for power supply to consumers and system losses will increase. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) for the investments on Upolu is estimated at 13.6%. Benefits which \nare difficult to quantify, such as those associated with the noise and emission control program at \nthe  Tanugamanono  power  station  and  the  protection  of  transmission  lines  against  climate \nchange, have not been included in the analysis. The result is most sensitive to the estimated \ncapital costs. Capital cost increases of more than 14% would make the EIRR fall below 12%.  \n \n72.  In the absence of investments on Savai\u2019i, it is assumed that EPC would meet demand \nwith its existing diesel power station. No improvements in the power factor or system upgrades \nwould take place. The without-investment scenario is associated with increased system losses \nand higher operations and maintenance costs. Under the base-case fuel price assumption of \n$60 per bbl, the economic analysis yields an EIRR of 10.7%. As the hydropower project is a \nmajor component of the investments on Savai\u2019i, the economic results are most sensitive to \noperations and maintenance costs, and in particular to assumptions on international fuel prices. \nAn international fuel price of $67 per bbl will increase the EIRR to 12%.  \n \n73.  The financial analyses assume that all project capital and operations and maintenance \ncosts  are  borne  by  EPC.  The  financial  benefits  comprise  projected  sales  based  on  tariff \nprojections,  demand  forecasts,  and  estimated  carbon  credits  of  $45,000  per  year.  The \nincremental financial costs comprise capital, operations and maintenance, and system losses. \nFinancial benefits and costs were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), \ncalculated at 4.5. The financial net present values discounted at the WACC for the investment \nplan are ST44.1 million ($17.3 million) for the investments on Upolu and ST27.9 million ($10.9 \nmillion) for Savai\u2019i. The financial rates of returns are 7.0% for the investments on Upolu and \n12.1% for Savai\u2019i. The financial result for Upolu is most sensitive to an increase in capital costs, \nfollowed  by  a  reduction  in  sales.  The  investment  plan  would  remain  financially  viable  if \ninvestment cost increases do not exceed 31%. The financial result for Savai\u2019i is most sensitive \nto changes in fuel prices, but the international oil price would need to drop to below $27 per bbl \nto undermine financial viability.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n74.  To  ensure  that  social,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environment  impacts  are \nmitigated under the Project, EPC will establish an environment and social unit (ESU) to plan, \nimplement, and coordinate land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental activities prior to \nloan effectiveness. The ESU will initially be an integral part of the PMU but will eventually \nbecome a permanent unit within EPC. The ESU will be responsible for establishing a register to \n ", "18    \nrecord and monitor temporary and permanent land acquisition and record consultations and \ngrievances relating to land acquisition and resettlement.   \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n75.  A LARF (Supplementary Appendix C) has been prepared in accordance with the Taking \nof  Lands  Act  (1964)  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  Handbook  on \nResettlement (1998), Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2006), Handbook on \nPoverty and Social Analysis (2001), and Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in \nProjects (1994).12 The LARF will guide the preparation and procedures for land acquisition and \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nresettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for  candidate  subprojects  under  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan. \nSubprojects classified category A will require a LARP, category B subprojects will require a \nshort LARP, and category C subprojects will not require any LARP. Candidate subproject \nLARPs will be prepared in full consultation with affected people and disclosed to them in draft \nform  and  included  in  the  feasibility  studies  for  candidate  subprojects.  Compensation  and \nentitlements will be consistent with those in the entitlement matrix outlined in the LARF. All \naffected people will be provided with compensation if (i) land is permanently or temporarily \nacquired, (ii) their crops and trees are damaged or destroyed, or (iii) access to their traditional \nlands is limited or blocked as a result of the subproject. Lack of legal documents pertaining to \ntheir customary rights of occupancy, or lack of titles, will not affect affected people\u2019s eligibility for \ncompensation.  \n \n76.  The two core subprojects (the Hospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 1, and the \nsupply and installation of prepayment meters) will not have land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts, are classified category C, and do not require LARPs. \n \n2.  Social and Gender \n77.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy was developed based on the findings \nof an initial poverty reduction and social assessment and social surveys. During development of \nEPC's  investment  plan,  consultations  with  representatives  of  communities,  government \nministries, and other stakeholders were undertaken. Focus-group consultations were held with \nwomen. No specific impacts to women are envisaged. If land acquisition is required, women will \nbe  incorporated  into  the  consultation  and  decision-making  process.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n3.  Environment \n78.  An  EARF  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental requirements as set out in the Planning and Urban Management \nAct (2004), the Draft Planning and Urban Management (Environmental Impact Assessment) \nRegulations  (2007),  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003). 13 The  EARF  will  guide  the  preparation  and  approval  procedures  of \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nenvironmental assessments of candidate subprojects under EPC\u2019s investment plan. Subprojects \nwith environmental category A are not envisaged and will not be eligible for ADB financing \nunder the Project. \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1994.

Candidate subproject IEEs will be included in the feasibility studies for submission to \nADB. An EMMP will be required for subprojects classified as environmental category B or B-\nsensitive. Subproject feasibility reports will identify adequate funding for EMMPs. Subproject \nEMMPs will be reflected in the bid documents, incorporated into project design, and included in \ncivil works contracts for subprojects. The PMU and contractors will be guided by the EMMPs in \nmanaging, monitoring, and reporting environmental impacts and compliance. Civil works may \nonly commence once the IEE report of subprojects are approved by ADB and the development \nconcept approval of the PEAR is issued by PUMA.   \n \n80.  The Hospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 1 is classified environmental category B, \nand the supply and installation of prepayment meters project is classified category C. An IEE \nhas  been  prepared  for  the  Hospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  \u2013  stage  1  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). The summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix F. \nAn IEE is not required for the prepayment metering project.  \n \nC.  Risks and Assumptions \n81.  Debt Sustainability. EPC\u2019s investment plan and financing arrangements have been \nprepared considering Samoa\u2019s debt sustainability. To ease the macroeconomic impact of the \nlarge financing requirements in the power sector, ADB will provide an ADF IX grant of $15.39 \nmillion. The ADB and JBIC concessional loans are projected to increase Samoa\u2019s external debt \nburden from 37% of GDP in 2007 to about 39% in 2011. \n \n82.  Political  Commitment  to  Power  Sector  Reform  and  Good  Governance.  Power \nsector reform, including cabinet and parliamentary approval of an electricity act to govern all \nstakeholders  and  the  establishment  of  a  regulatory  agency,  is  critical  to  improving  the \nperformance  of  the  power  sector  and  ensuring  that  investments  translate  into  benefits  for \nelectricity consumers. The TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy will \nassist the Government (i) in the consultation process, (ii) to draft and amend legislation, and (iii) \nestablish the regulatory agency. Assurances under the Project reflect the key milestones for \nregulatory reform. \n \n83.  EPC\u2019s Affordability. EPC\u2019s affordability of the investment plan and debt repayment \ncapacity has been carefully considered in the selection and timing of subprojects. To ensure \nthat timely adjustments to tariffs can be made in response to increases in EPC costs, a formal \nmechanism for determining tariffs within the context of an overall regulatory framework needs to \nbe established. Until a tariff mechanism can be established, the Government has introduced a \nfuel surcharge which is subject to review by cabinet every 6 months.14 Ongoing policy dialogue \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand  annual  updates  of  EPC\u2019s  financial  projections  will  help  assess tariff  requirements.  To \naddress  EPC\u2019s  poor  collection  performance,  the  Government  will  clear  all  arrears  by \ngovernment ministries and state-owned entities prior to loan effectiveness, and prepayment \nmetering will be installed for EPC consumers. The assurances under the Project include that \n75% of all consumers are on prepayment meters by the end of 2012. In the case of certain \nbasic social services where suspending electricity services may not be possible, budgetary \nallocations for electricity consumption will be paid directly to EPC.  \n \n84.  Counterpart Financing. EPC\u2019s ability to provide counterpart financing is expected to be \nlimited before the major financial benefits of the investment plan are realized. It is estimated that \nEPC will be able to provide $12 million of the total counterpart financing requirement over the \n                                                 \n14  More frequent reviews are being considered by cabinet.   \n ", "20    \n2008\u20132015 investment period, leaving a residual amount of $8 million. The Government of \nAustralia will finance the portion beyond the capacity of EPC, and this will be reflected as the \nGovernment\u2019s equity in EPC.  \n \n85.  EPC\u2019s Implementation Capacity and Cost Overruns. To manage the risk of delays, \nconsultations with the attorney general have been held to ensure that Government requirements \nfor loan effectiveness are addressed in a timely manner and draft bid documents have been \nprepared  to  help  ensure  timely  implementation  of  core  subprojects.  Approval  of  advance \nprocurement action will help ensure that construction activities can commence in accordance \nwith  the  implementation  schedule.  Advance  recruitment  of  the  project  manager  and \nimplementation consultants will help mitigate EPC\u2019s capacity constraints in project preparation \nand procurement activities. To the extent possible, EPC will apply plant design, supply, and \ninstall contracts to reduce the burden of coordination of construction activities.    \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n86.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the EPC have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  EPC shall ensure that the PMU and ESU are adequately staffed and resourced; \n(ii)  the  Government  and  EPC  shall  ensure  that  all  candidate  subprojects  are \nselected  and  approved  based  on  the  agreed  eligibility  criteria  and  approval \nprocedures;  \n(iii)  the Government and EPC shall ensure that the annual aggregate disbursements \nof  the  Government  of  Australia  grant  for  the  Project  are  treated  as  the \nGovernment of Samoa equity in EPC\u2019s annual financial statements and audited \naccounts, and will be reflected in EPC\u2019s share capital when EPC is registered as \na limited company;  \n(iv)  the Government shall establish an incentive scheme for canceling repayment by \nEPC of the grant relent by the Government through treating such portion as a \ngrant from the Government to EPC  (up to 7% of Project costs or up to a ceiling \nof $10 million) when agreed conditions are met by EPC; \n(v)  the Government shall establish a regulatory framework for the power sector \nthrough: (a) submitting a draft Electricity Act and draft amendments to the EPC \nAct 1980 for cabinet and parliamentary consideration by 31 December 2009; (b) \nfollowing approval of the draft legislation, approving resource allocations, and a \nfunding mechanism for a power sector regulatory agency for FY2010; and (c) \nappointing the regulator by 31 December 2010;  \n(vi)  the Government shall have settled all electricity arrears of government ministries \nand government-owned entities as of 30 April 2008 by 31 July 2008; \n(vii)  the Government and EPC shall ensure that prepayment meters are installed on: \n(a) all new electricity connections by 30 June 2008; and (b) a minimum of 75% of \nall electricity connections by 31 December 2012.

Power Sector Overview \n1.  The power sector in Samoa has undergone rapid transformation over the last decade \ntowards having an energy supply based on imported petroleum and hydropower-generated \nelectricity.  This  transformation  has  been  driven  by  economic  growth  that  has  resulted  in \nincreasing demand for electricity and transportation. Energy demand in Samoa is met by three \nmain sources: biomass (47%), fossil fuel (45%), and hydropower (8%). Biomass is mainly used \nfor cooking, whereas imported petroleum is used for transportation and power generation. \nImports of petroleum products account for 15% of Samoa\u2019s total import expenditure. Power \ngeneration accounts for about 20% of total imported petroleum.  \n \n2.  The Energy Unit of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has the overall responsibility for policy \nand strategic planning for the power sector. The Electric Power Corporation (EPC) is vested \nwith all operating responsibilities for the power sector. EPC is a wholly owned government \ncorporation established in 1972. The utility operates as a separate entity and is defined as a \npublic trading body under the Public Bodies Act (2001) with the principal objective of operating \nas  a  commercial  business.  The  EPC  Act  (1980)  mandates  EPC  with  the  authority  for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution of electricity throughout Samoa.  \n \n3.  EPC is governed by a board of directors, the composition of which is specified in the \nEPC Act. The chairman is the minister of the Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure \n(MWTI) and the general manager is the deputy chairman. The Government is represented on \nthe board of directors by the chief executive officers of MOF, MWTI, and Ministry of Commerce, \nIndustry  and  Labour.  Nongovernment  representation  comprises  representatives  of  law \npractitioners, the Chamber of Commerce, and domestic consumers. The general manager is the \nlegal  representative  of EPC  and  is  responsible  for  the  administration  and  management  of \ncorporate business. The corporation has 482 employees and services about 29,800 consumers \nthroughout Samoa. With the rural electrification program nearing completion, about 95% of the \npopulation has access to electricity. The average household consumption is 76 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) per month.  \n \nB.  The Power Systems \n4.  EPC\u2019s power system comprises a grid on each of Upolu and Savai\u2019i islands, which \ntogether account for nearly all energy sales, and small stand-alone solar and diesel generation \nschemes on two isolated islands. The total installed capacity of EPC is 37.2 megawatts (MW), \nincluding 24.7 MW of diesel generation.  \n \n5.  The generation on Upolu, which accounts for 90% of EPC\u2019s total generation, comes from \na mix of diesel and hydropower stations. Residential consumers accounted for 25% of sales in \n2006. The main power station on Upolu is located at Tanugamanono and has five diesel \ngeneration units with a combined available generation capacity of 17.9 MW. One of the units is \nkept on standby and is scheduled for retirement in 2009. The load factor is about 66% and the \naverage fuel efficiency is 4 kWh per liter (l). Of the 12.5 MW of hydropower generation capacity, \n6.7 MW is firm, and 4.0 MW of this comes from the Afulilo storage hydropower scheme on \nUpolu. The remaining hydropower capacity comes from four run-of-the-river schemes on Upolu, \none  of  which  is  scheduled  for  retirement  in  2009  unless  refurbished.  The  run-of-the-river \nhydropower schemes suffer large reductions in output during the dry season, resulting in a \nsignificant reduction in available energy.  \n ", "30  Appendix 2   \n \n6.  Peak  electricity  demands  on  Upolu  reached 17.6  MW  in  2006.  With  peak  demand \ngrowing by 7.3% in the short term and by 4% beyond 2009, a shortfall of 0.3 MW is expected in \n2008. By 2010, this shortfall will have increased to 4.1 MW if no new generation plants are \ncommissioned. EPC plans to utilize the existing capacity from self-generation by consumers \n(estimated to be at least 8 MW) to reduce peak requirements in the short term. By 2011, EPC \nwill need to invest in new generation capacity. By 2015, the deficit will increase to 9 MW, \nrepresenting 33% of peak demand. \n \n7.  The  power  system  on  Upolu  faces  immediate  challenges  in  order  to  (i)  improve \nutilization of existing generation assets, (ii) reduce losses and meet demand, and (iii) improve \nreliability of services to consumers. The total energy produced in 2006 was 101.0 gigawatt-\nhours (GWh). Energy is distributed from the power stations via 22 kilovolt (kV) and 6.6 kV radial \ntransmission lines. Along these transmission lines, transformers step the voltage down to supply \nlocal demand. Power system losses on Upolu are estimated at 19.2% of energy produced, \ninclusive of nontechnical losses.  \n \n8.  Investment needs in the power system on Upolu are driven by the need to (i) remove \ntransmission bottlenecks to reduce losses, and (ii) improve reliability and capacity to meet peak \ndemand. If investments in the transmission network are undertaken to reduce system losses, \nthe existing generation capacity can meet energy requirements until 2018 when a 6.2 GWh \nshortfall  is  expected.  This  shortfall  will  increase  to  20.1  GWh  by  2020  unless  additional \ngeneration capacity is installed.  \n \n9.  Savai\u2019i has one operational diesel power station located at Salalologa. The power station \nhas  six  secondhand  generation  units  with  a  combined  available capacity  of  5.2  MW.  The \nestimated load factor is 41% and the total energy produced in 2006 was 11.1 GWh. Fuel \nefficiency is estimated at 3.3 kWh per l.  \n \n10.  Savai\u2019i accounts for about 10% of energy sales in Samoa and the majority of consumers \nare residential consumers. Peak electricity demand reached 3.0 MW in 2006 and is predicted to \ngrow at 4.3% annually in the short term. Beyond 2009, the peak demand growth is expected to \nslow to around 3.0%. The existing diesel power station is estimated to meet capacity and annual \nenergy  requirements  (assuming  appropriate  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  existing \ngeneration  units)  but  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  (i)  improve  the  control  system  at  the \npowerhouse, (ii) reduce technical and nontechnical power system losses, (iii) improve fuel \ncontrol and conduct regular fuel audits, and (iv) eventually reduce fuel consumption through \nrenewable energy resources. Power is distributed via 22 kV transmission lines with step-down \ntransformers and a low voltage network to supply local demand. The total power system losses \nare estimated at 21.4%, including nontechnical losses.   \n \nC.  Sector Policy \n11.  The energy sector in Samoa comprises four subsectors including petroleum, power, \ntransport, and renewable energy. The overarching goal for the energy sector is to enhance the \nquality of life for all Samoans through access to reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound \nenergy  services  and  supply.  Developing  indigenous  and  renewable  energy  resources  and \nenergy conservation measures to reduce the economy\u2019s risk exposure to foreign exchange \nfluctuations and fuel price increases is a high development priority for Samoa and is articulated \nin the Strategy for the Development of Samoa. Consistent with this goal, the Samoa National \nEnergy Policy 2007 emphasizes the development of the country\u2019s renewable energy resources \n ", "  Appendix 2  31\nand promotion of energy efficiency and conservation for end users as vital to achieving a \nsustainable energy sector.  \n \n12.  For the power sector, the National Energy Policy outlines the objective as providing \nefficient and reliable electricity services to all consumers at affordable prices. Consistent with \nthis objective, EPC\u2019s corporate plan identifies the provision of reliable and affordable electricity \nservices as the vision for the corporation.  \n \n13.  The small size of the Samoan economy makes the country vulnerable to impacts of \nclimate change and global warming. Samoa has little ability to directly impact climate change \nand global warming. The Government\u2019s National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) 2005 is \na national implementation strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change over the long \nterm. The NAPA emphasizes the importance of measures to adapt to the changing global \nenvironment,  including  the  prioritization  of  protection  of  key  infrastructure  assets.  EPC  is \nresponsible for undertaking protective measures for the power sector.   \n \nD.  Sector Priorities  \n14.  The Government\u2019s program for the power sector focuses on three immediate priorities: \n(i) EPC\u2019s investment plan to improve reliability of power supply and meet growing demand, (ii) \nimproved financial performance of EPC, and (iii) the establishment of effective regulation for the \npower sector to improve arrangements for tariff setting and technical regulation, and promote \ncost-effective private sector participation. An enabling environment that promotes renewable \nenergy resources is a key longer-term priority.  \n \n15.  While the development of indigenous and renewable energy sources, and improvements \nin efficiency of EPC\u2019s operations, are key strategies for realizing the Government\u2019s priorities and \nEPC\u2019s corporate plan, socially acceptable, technically viable, and affordable renewable energy \nresources are limited in Samoa. Development of potential hydropower schemes and other \nrenewable resources will help to replace fuel-generated power and reduce EPC\u2019s exposure to \nforeign exchange fluctuations and fuel price increases. However, these renewable options will \nnot help address the need to meet peak demand. The power sector is currently characterized by \nexcess energy and capacity shortages, particularly during the dry season. In the short term, \ncapacity constraints on Upolu could be met by utilizing existing self-generation on an as-needs \nbasis. EPC has emphasized measures to reduce peak requirements. An immediate priority is to \ninstall prepayment meters to all consumers to lay the foundation for effective demand-side \nmanagement. EPC is also considering bulk-purchase agreements with major consumers which \nwill provide incentives for off-peak consumption.  \n \n16.  The priority for EPC is to upgrade the transmission capacity to (i) improve utilization of \nexisting generation plants, (ii) reduce system losses, (iii) improve reliability and security of \nsupply to main industrial and commercial consumers, and (iv) address overloading on the \nexisting underground transmission line to the hospital. Consistent with the priorities outlined in \nthe NAPA (2005), EPC aims to reduce the exposure to cyclones of its transmission network \nthrough  the  underground  cabling  of  selected  transmission  lines.  The  underground  cabling \nprogram, which is included in EPC\u2019s investment plan 2008\u20132015, comprises five subprojects: (i) \nHospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  \u2013  stage  1,  (ii)  Upolu  diesel  power  station  to  Fuluasou \nSubstation 22 kV underground cable project, (iii) Hospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 2, \n(iv) Fuluasou Substation to Apia Wharf area 22 kV underground cable project, and (v) Fuluasou \nSubstation to Laulumauga via Vaigaga 22 kV underground cable project. \n \n ", "32  Appendix 2   \n17.  On  Savai\u2019i,  the  key  immediate  priorities  are  to  improve  the  power  factor,  improve \nvoltages, and reduce system losses. EPC has also commenced conducting audits to improve \nfuel control. The medium-term priority is to develop the island\u2019s hydropower potential to reduce \nfuel consumption. However, a key constraint to hydropower development in Samoa is the \npolitical  nature  of  the  consultation  processes  and  the  disagreements  between  affected \ncommunities. If the hydropower potential cannot be realized, Savai\u2019i will continue to rely on \ndiesel for power generation. \n \n18.  Unpredictable long-term financing for needed investments is a key factor constraining \nEPC\u2019s  efforts  to  move  away  from  reactive  management  to  more  proactive  planning, \nmaintenance,  and  customer  relations.  EPC  is  increasingly  placing  emphasis  on  least-cost \nplanning of investments, but both technical and financial capacity for long-term investment \nplanning are likely to remain constrained in the short term.  \n \n19.  Over  the  past  6  years,  EPC  has  struggled  to  improve  its  financial  performance  to \nsatisfactory levels. This is largely due to poor collections performance in combination with \ninadequate and delayed tariff adjustments in response to fuel price increases. The effect of the \ntariff increases has also been limited by EPC\u2019s inability to significantly improve its collections \nperformance. Government entities account for a disproportionate share of EPC\u2019s arrears from \nelectricity sales. While electricity sales to government entities account for 11% of total sales, \nthey account for 59% of existing total arrears.  \n \n20.  EPC  has  taken  measures  to  improve  its  collections.  It  has  begun  to  introduce \nprepayment metering and has so far installed 1,200 meters, primarily for domestic customers \nand  small  businesses.  The  investment  plan  will  extend  prepayment  metering  to  all  EPC \ncustomers, including three-phase meters for government ministries and entities, and private \nsector consumers. In the case of certain social services, such as hospitals and water supply \nwhere  suspending  electricity  service  may  not  be  possible,  it  is  proposed  that  government \nbudgetary support to these entities will incorporate a specific allocation for electricity. In cases \nwhere these allocations are not being used to pay EPC, the Government would withhold the \nallocation and make payment directly to EPC.  \n \n21.  To ensure that timely adjustments to tariffs can be made in response to increases in \nEPC costs, there is a need to establish a more formal mechanism for determining tariffs within \nthe context of an overall regulatory framework for the electricity sector. An automatic tariff \nadjustment mechanism was approved by the Government in 2001, but has not been fully \nimplemented. While this mechanism provides for automatic tariff adjustments resulting from \nmovements in fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, it lacks incentives to promote efficiency \ngains by EPC. There is also an opportunity to improve the existing tariff structure and bulk \npurchase arrangements with large consumers to provide incentives for energy conservation and \ndemand-side  management.  This  is  particularly  important  during  the  growing  daily  peak  in \ndemand when EPC relies most heavily on expensive diesel generation.  \n \n22.  In the absence of an electricity act, the EPC Act (1980), EPC Amendments Acts (2001), \nand  the  Public  Bodies  Act  (2001)  govern  the  power  sector.  The  State  Owned  Enterprise \nMonitoring Division is mandated with monitoring the financial performance of EPC. Under the \nprovisions of the EPC Act, the Licensing Committee is responsible for issuing licensing for \nelectrical works, generation, and distribution of electricity.  \n \n23.  An automatic tariff adjustment mechanism was approved in 2001 but has not been fully \nimplemented. Instead, tariff submissions are made to cabinet, which approves electricity tariffs. \n ", "  Appendix 2  33\nBefore the 15% increase in May 2005, tariffs had remained constant since 2001. A simplified \ntariff structure, which became effective in February 2007, allows for a fuel surcharge of 15%. \nThe fuel surcharge is subject to review by cabinet every 6 months. There is currently no \nmandated public consultation process in the existing tariff approval process. An ongoing public \nconsultation process on the cost of electricity services and tariff setting is particularly important \nconsidering EPC\u2019s exposure to international fuel prices. About 60% of generation is currently \nsupplied  by  diesel  generation.  With  growing  demand,  the  impact  of  fuel  prices  on  tariff \nrequirements will increase over time. \n \n24.  Existing  arrangements  do  not  include  formal  technical  regulation  or  monitoring  of \ntechnical performance. The lack of specifications of technical standards inhibits monitoring and \nbenchmarking  of  EPC\u2019s  technical  performance  to  ensure  investments  and  operations  and \nmaintenance are undertaken to an appropriate standard or at least-cost. \n \n25.  Appropriate  arrangements  for  tariff  setting,  technical  regulation,  and  private  sector \nparticipation are becoming increasingly important for improving the performance of the power \nsector in Samoa. The Government has recognized that the existing arrangements are a key \ndevelopment constraint for the power sector and is embarking on a reform process to improve \nthe  performance  of  the  sector  and  encourage  cost-effective  private  sector  participation. \nDiscussions on regulatory aspects of the power sector have been taking place through technical \nassistance provided by the Asian Development Bank.1 These discussions have focused on the \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nneed for an electricity act to govern all stakeholders in the power sector in Samoa, and for a \nregulatory body to be established to (i) remove existing regulatory functions from EPC, (ii) \nprovide appropriate arrangements for tariff setting, and (iii) enable private sector participation to \nreduce  public  sector  investment  requirements  and  promote  least-cost  generation  to  meet \ngrowing electricity demand.

The Electric Power Corporation\u2019s (EPC) power system comprises a grid on each of \nUpolu and Savai\u2019i islands, which together account for nearly all energy sales, and small stand-\nalone solar and diesel generation schemes on two isolated islands. The total installed capacity \nof EPC is 37.2 megawatts (MW), including 24.7 MW of diesel generation.  \n \nA.  The Power System on Upolu \n2.  The generation on Upolu, which accounts for 90% of EPC\u2019s total generation, is a mix of \ndiesel and hydropower stations. The main power station on Upolu is located at Tanugamanono \nand has five diesel generation units with a combined available generation capacity of 17.9 MW. \nOne of the units is kept on standby and is scheduled for retirement in 2009. The load factor is \nabout 66% and the average fuel efficiency is 4 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per liter (l). Of the 12.5 MW \nof hydropower generation capacity, 6.7 MW is firm, and 4.0 MW of that comes from the Afulilo \nstorage hydropower scheme. The remaining hydropower capacity comes from four run-of-the-\nriver schemes on Upolu, one of which is scheduled for retirement in 2009 unless refurbished. \nThe run-of-the-river hydropower schemes suffer from large reductions in output during the dry \nseason, resulting in a significant reduction in available energy.  \n \n3.  Investment needs in generation are mainly driven by growing peak electricity demands. \nPeak demand on Upolu reached 17.6 MW in 2006 (Table A3.1). With peak demand growing by \n7.3% in the short term and by 4% beyond 2009, a shortfall of 0.3 MW is expected in 2008. By \n2010,  this  shortfall  will  have  increased  to  4.1  MW  if  no  new  generation  plants  are \ncommissioned. EPC plans to utilize the existing capacity from self-generation by consumers \n(estimated to be at least 8 MW) to reduce peak requirements in the short term. By 2011, EPC \nwould need to invest in new generation capacity. By 2015, the deficit will increase to 9 MW, \nrepresenting 33% of peak demand. \n \nTable A3.1: Upolu Power Balance \n(MW) \nYear  Peak  Total Firm  Firm Capacity  Power  Reserve Firm \nDemand  Generation  at N-1  Balance at  Generation \nCapacity  Reserve  N-1  Capacity \n2005  17.0  24.6  20.5  3.6  7.7 \n2006  17.6  24.6  20.5  3.0  7.1 \n2007  19.7  24.6  20.5  0.9  5.0 \n2008  20.8  24.6  20.5  (0.3)  3.8 \n2009  21.7  24.6  20.3  (1.4)  2.9 \n2010  22.6  22.8  18.5  (4.1)  0.2 \n2011  23.5  22.8  18.5  (5.0)  (0.7) \n  MW = megawatt, N-1 = total generation capacity minus the largest generator.  \n  Sources: Asian Development Bank and Electric Power Corporation estimates. \n \n4.  The total energy produced on Upolu in 2006 was 101.0 gigawatt-hours (GWh). Energy is \ndistributed from the power stations via 22 kilovolt (kV) and 6.6 kV radial transmission lines. \nAlong these transmission lines, transformers step the voltage down to supply local demand. \nTotal  power  system  losses  on  Upolu  are  estimated  at  19.2%  of  energy  produced.  The \ntransmission  system,  which  is  aging,  overloaded,  and  poorly  maintained,  is  increasingly \nbecoming a bottleneck to the reliable supply of electricity. \n ", "  Appendix 3  35 \n \n5.  Investment needs in the transmission network are driven by the need to reduce losses \nand  increase  capacity  to  improve  reliability  and  meet  peak  demand. If  investments  in the \ntransmission network are undertaken to reduce system losses, the existing generation capacity \ncan meet energy requirements until 2013 when a 1.3 GWh shortfall is expected.1 This shortfall \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nwill increase to 25.7 GWh by 2020 unless additional generation capacity is installed.  \n \n6.  Load-flow  analysis  was  conducted  on  individual  transmission  lines  and  the  power \nsystem as a whole for peak demand. The analysis shows that voltage drops and losses are \nexcessive on two of the three 6.6 kV transmission lines, including the Hospital and Alaoa \ntransmission lines. Overloading of the existing Hospital Feeder, which carries more than 10% of \nenergy sold on Upolu, contributes significantly to the high overall system losses and voltage \ndrops. By 2011, the Hospital Feeder is estimated to be 30% overloaded. The underutilized 22 \nkV Vaitele Feeder is identified as a prime candidate to provide relief for the Hospital Feeder. \nThe West Coast 22 kV transmission line, which supplies power to consumers west of Apia, \nshows risk of overloading by 2011. Voltage drops at peak demand are predicted to increase \nfrom 8.9% in 2006 to 15.5% in 2016 as the demand on the transmission line increases. Losses \nare estimated to increase from 4.3% in 2006 to 7.4% by 2016. Similarly, the South Coast \ntransmission  line  will  experience  voltage  drops  before  2016.  The  results  of  the  load-flow \nanalysis are in Table A3.2 and peak technical system losses are reported in Table A3.3. \n \nTable A3.2: Summary Results of Upolu Load-Flow Analysis  \n \nTransmission  Capacity \nMain Findings \nLine  (kV) \n\u2022  Very excessive voltage drops: 10% in 2006 increasing to 18% in \nAlaoa  6.6    2016. \n\u2022  High losses: 8% in 2006 increasing to 13% by 2016 \nBeach Road  6.6  \u2022  Losses: less than 1% in dry season but 11% in wet season \n\u2022  Very excessive voltage drops: 11% in 2006 increasing to 20% in \n  2016. \nHospital  6.6 \n\u2022  Loading: overloaded by 34% in 2011 reaching 69% by 2016 \n\u2022  High losses: 6% in 2006 increasing to 11% by 2016 \n\u2022  Voltage drops: 5% in 2006 increasing to 8% by 2016 \nEast Coast  22  \u2022  Loading: 8% overloaded in dry season on part of the transmission \n  line by 2016 \n\u2022  Low losses: less than 1% \nVaitele  22 \n\u2022  Loading: under loaded \n\u2022  Excessive voltage drops: 9% in 2006 increasing to 16% by 2016 \n\u2022  Loading: 5% overloaded in 2011 on part of the transmission line, \nWest Coast  22 \n  increasing to 31% by 2016 \n\u2022  High Losses: 4% in 2006 increasing to 7% by 2016   \n\u2022  Excessive voltage drops: 5% in 2006 increasing to 9% by 2016 \nSouth Coast  22  \u2022  Losses: 3% in 2006 rising to 4% by 2016 \n\u2022  Other: lightly loaded transmission line but very long \nTanugamanono  \u2022  Loading: overloaded in dry season 2016 \n22/6.6 \nSubstation  \u2022  Losses: 1% in 2006 rising to 2% in 2016 \nkV = kilovolt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                 \n1  With the N-1 reliability criteria (total generation capacity minus the largest generator). \n ", "36  Appendix 3   \nTable A3.3: Summary System Technical Losses at Peak \nTotal \nTotal Diesel \nHydropower  Peak Demand  Total Losses \nYear  Season  generation \nGeneration  (MW)  (%) \n(MW) \n(MW) \n2006  Dry  13.59  4.6  17.57  3.44 \n  Wet  8.33  10.0  17.57  4.18 \n2011  Dry  20.10  4.6  23.50  4.71 \n  Wet  14.71  10.0  23.50  4.90 \n2016  Dry  25.85  4.6  28.60  6.08 \n  Wet  20.37  10.0  28.60  5.84 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n7.  Reliability  and  system  losses  are  significantly  affected  by  cyclones.  In  2004,  when \ncyclone Heta hit Samoa, system losses increased by 21% for the year. Consumers in the main \nindustrial and business districts were left without power for several weeks. The direct costs for \npower  sector  infrastructure  were  estimated  at  $2.8  million.  To  reduce  the  vulnerability  to \ncyclones  and  other  weather  events  of  the  transmission  network,  EPC  plans  to  place \nunderground key transmission lines that serve the major load centers in Apia.  \n \nB.  The Power System on Savai\u2019i \n8.  Savai\u2019i has one operational diesel power station at Salalologa. The power station has six \nsecondhand generation units with a combined available capacity of 5.2 MW. The estimated load \nfactor is 41% and the total energy produced in 2006 was 11.1 GWh. Fuel efficiency is estimated \nat 3.3 kWh per l.  \n \n9.  Savai\u2019i accounts for about 10% of energy sales in Samoa and the majority of consumers \nare residential consumers. Peak electricity demand reached 3.0 MW in 2006 and is predicted to \ngrow at 4.3% annually in the short term. Beyond 2009, the peak growth is expected to slow to \naround 3.0%. The power balance is shown in Table A3.4. The existing diesel power station is \nestimated to meet capacity and annual energy requirements (assuming appropriate operations \nand maintenance of the existing generation units) but there is an urgent need to (i) improve the \ncontrol system at the powerhouse, (ii) reduce technical and nontechnical power system losses, \n(iii) improve fuel control, and (iv) conduct regular fuel audits. To reduce fuel consumption on \nSavai\u2019i and diversify energy sources, EPC aims to develop the hydropower potential.    \n \nTable A3.4: Savai\u2019i Power Balance  \nTotal Generation  Reserve Firm \nPeak Demand  Total Sales \nYear  Capacity  Generation Capacity \n(MW)  (GWh) \n(MW)  (MW) \n2005  2.9  8.93   5.2  2.2 \n2006  3.0  8.41   5.2  2.2 \n2007  3.1  8.54   5.2  2.1 \n2008  3.3  8.91   5.2  1.9 \n2009  3.4  9.48   5.2  1.8 \n2010  3.5  9.82   5.2  1.7 \n2011  3.6  10.17   5.2  1.6 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Electric Power Corporation. \n ", "  Appendix 3  37 \n \n10.

Electric Power Corporation\u2019s Investment Plan \n11.  With technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), EPC has developed \nan investment plan for generation and transmission investments for the period 2008\u20132015. The \ninvestment plan is consistent with the Government\u2019s and EPC\u2019s immediate priorities to secure \nreliability of power supply to the main economic growth center and the hospital, and improve \nrevenue collection for EPC through installation of prepayment meters for all consumers. An \nimmediate priority is to install prepayment meters to all consumers to improve and lay the \nfoundation  for  effective  demand-side  management.  EPC  is  also  considering  bulk-purchase \nagreements  with  major  consumers  to  provide  incentives  to  switch  from  peak  to  off-peak \nconsumption. \n \n12.  EPC\u2019s  power  systems  are  currently  characterized  by  excess  energy  and  capacity \nshortages, particularly during the dry season. EPC has prioritized increasing the capacity of the \ntransmission network to improve reliability and security of supply to the main business and \ncommercial load center in Apia, and reduce the load on the existing underground transmission \nline to the hospital. EPC aims to reduce the vulnerability of its transmission network through \nunderground  cabling  of  selected  transmission  lines.  The  underground  cabling  program \ncomprises the Hospital Feeder upgrading project and the Vaitele underground cable project. \nThese transmission lines evacuate power to the hospital and the main industrial and commercial \nareas of Apia. To support EPC\u2019s loss-reduction program, portable equipment for measuring \nvoltage and current are included for purchase in 2008. This will help identify measures for \nfurther loss reduction. \n \n13.  On Savai\u2019i, the immediate priorities are to improve the power factor, improve voltages, \nand reduce system losses. A mini-hydro plant that will reduce fuel consumption on the island is \nscheduled for commissioning in 2014. To identify future feasible hydropower projects on both \nUpolu and Savai\u2019i, water-flow gauging measurement equipment has been included for purchase \nin 2008.

Financial Performance: Fiscal Years 2001\u20132006 \n1.  Over the past 6 years, the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) has struggled to improve its \nfinancial performance. Due largely to inadequate tariff levels and poor collections performance, \nEPC has been unable to meet its debt service obligations and still fund capital investments that \nare  essential  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand.  With  90%  of  its  debt  payable  to  the \nGovernment under 12 separate loans, EPC secured an agreement to restructure this debt into a \nsingle loan in 2002. Although this reduced annual debt service by 30%, EPC again fell into \narrears. By July 2006, it had paid only 55% of the amount due under the restructuring and was \nin arrears by just under ST9 million ($3.5 million). With continuing growth in sales and reduced \nunit operating costs, EPC\u2019s financial performance gradually improved up to FY2004, before \nweakening again in FY2005, primarily because of higher fuel prices. Although tariffs were \nincreased by 15% in May 2005, this was not sufficient to fully offset higher fuel costs. Fuel \nprices continued to increase, and by August 2006 were 75% higher than in mid-2004. In \nFebruary 2007, a fuel surcharge was introduced that implied an effective average tariff increase \nof  14%.  However,  the  impact  of  tariff  increases  has  been  limited  by  EPC\u2019s  inability  to \nsignificantly improve its poor collections performance, a disproportionate share of which is due \nto government accounts. \n \n2.  Sales and Profitability. About 95% of EPC\u2019s revenue is generated from the sale of \nelectricity. Since FY2001, electricity revenue has increased just over 50% (about four times the \ngrowth  in  sales)  due  to  the  cancellation  of  prompt  payment  discounts  and  proportionately \ngreater nondomestic consumption. This revenue growth, combined with lower unit operating \ncosts, enabled EPC to earn modest net profits over the FY2003\u2013FY2006 period after net losses \nthe two previous years. Net profit peaked in FY2004 at ST2.4 million ($0.9 million) on revenue \nof ST53.7 million ($21.1 million) before declining to just over ST0.3 million ($0.1 million) in \nFY2005 and ST1.4 million ($0.6 million) in FY2006. This decline in profitability was due primarily \nto higher fuel prices and an increase in the proportion of diesel generation. With existing \nhydropower facilities operating at or near capacity, increases in supply are being provided \nalmost entirely from diesel generation. In FY2006, diesel generation represented 53% of total \nenergy supply, up from 48% in FY2002. \n \n3.  Cost Structure. EPC\u2019s cost structure reflects its small scale of operations, distance from \nmajor markets, and particularly, its reliance on diesel generation. The overall cost of supply was \nST0.71 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.28 per kWh) sold in FY2006. Fuel is by far the single largest \nexpense item, representing 74% of generation costs and 53% of EPC\u2019s total costs. This leaves \nEPC highly exposed to changes in world oil prices.  \n \n4.  Tariffs. Given EPC\u2019s vulnerability to volatile world oil markets, the delay in adjusting \ntariffs to cover rapidly increasing fuel prices since 2004 has resulted in a significant deterioration \nin EPC\u2019s financial position. The average tariff remained unchanged between 1998 and 2005 \nalthough the structure was revised in 2001 to incorporate block tariffs for domestic customers \n(Table A4.1). The 15% increase in May 2005 was insufficient to cover the significant increases \nin EPC\u2019s costs that had accumulated since 1998. The most recent increase (14% in February \n2007) is a fuel surcharge which will be reviewed in 6 months on the basis of fuel prices at that \ntime. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  41   \n \nTable A4.1: Historic Tariffs \n(ST per kWh; current prices) \nSeptember  November  May  February \n  Item  1998  2001  2005  2007 a \nDomestic         \n  1\u201350 kWh per month  \u2014  0.50  0.58  0.67 \n  51\u2013200 kWh per month  \u2014  0.60  0.69  0.79 \n  > 200 kWh per monthb  \u2014  0.72  0.83  0.79 \nNondomestic  \u2014  0.60  0.69  0.79 \nAll Customers Flat Rate  0.60  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \nAveragec  0.60  0.59  0.68  0.77 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \na As of February 2007, the domestic blocks are 1\u201350 kWh per month and > 51 kWh per month. \nb Weighted average tariff based on tariffs in effect at end of fiscal year. \nc Including the fuel surcharge. \nSource: Electric Power Corporation. \n \n5.  Despite a gradual improvement in profitability up to FY2004, EPC has continued to \nexperience serious cash flow difficulties, which has caused it to fail to meet its debt service \nobligations and significantly curtail capital investments. With negative net cash flows in 3 of the \npast 6 years, the cash balance declined from ST16.4 million ($6.4 million) at the beginning of \nFY2001 to ST4.7 million ($1.9 million) by the end of FY2006. Given its weakening cash position, \ncapital investments had to be limited to an annual average of ST12.9 million ($5.1 million)1 over \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nthis period. Although modest in relation to EPC\u2019s investment needs, capital spending placed a \nsignificant strain on the corporation because over 80% was self-financed. This left insufficient \nresidual cash flow to service EPC\u2019s debt.  \n \n6.  Collection Performance. EPC\u2019s poor collection performance, which has progressively \ndeteriorated over the past 6 years, has been a major factor adversely affecting net cash flows. \nAt the end of FY2006, gross receivables were ST14.4 million ($5.6 million), equivalent to 80 \ndays of annual electricity billings, up from 53 days in  FY2001. By the end of May 2007, \nreceivables  had  increased  to  ST15  million  ($5.9  million),  despite  a  partial  settlement  of \ngovernment arrears in February 2007. Of this total, ST12.5 million ($4.9 million) is attributable to \nelectricity sales, of which ST7.4 million ($2.9 million), or 59% of the total, are in arrears. EPC\u2019s \nreceivables in its nonelectricity account2 totaled ST2.5 million ($1.0 million) at the end of March \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n2007.  \n \n7.  Government  Arrears.  Although  EPC  has  made  some  progress  in  achieving  better \ncollections  from  its  private  sector  customers,  its  inability  to  take  action  against  delinquent \ngovernment accounts has blocked any meaningful improvement in collections. While sales to \nthe  Government  account  for  11%  of  the  total,  55%  of  existing  arrears  are  due  to  the \nGovernment. EPC\u2019s largest single debtor is the Samoa Water Authority (SWA), which held \narrears of ST1.9 million ($0.7 million) at the end of May 2007. This amount represents 47% of \nelectricity arrears held by the Government and 26% of total electricity arrears. SWA\u2019s arrears \n                                                 \n1  Reported capital expenditures appear to overestimate actual expenditures because of accounting deficiencies in \nthe separation of total expenditures between those for capital works and operations and maintenance. \n2  These relate to new connection charges and other capital works (referred to as rechargeable works) as well as to \nold arrears from electricity sales, primarily from accounts now inactive. \n ", "42  Appendix 4   \nwould have been much higher if the Government had not periodically intervened to settle these \narrears on behalf of SWA.  \n  \n8.  Covenant Compliance. With its weak financial performance, EPC has achieved only \nlimited compliance with its financial covenants applied under existing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loans (Table A4.2).  \n \nTable A4.2: Status of Covenant Compliance \nIndicator  ADB Covenant  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006 \nReturn on Average Net Fixed  Minimum: 4% \n(1.8%)  (0.1%)  1.1%  1.6%  0.4%  1.2% \nAssets  FY2002\u2013FY2004, \nminimum 6% \nthereafter \nSelf-Financing Ratio (5 yr ave)  Minimum: 20%  (18%)  (10%)  (2%)  9%  14%  26% \nNet Income/(Loss) (ST million)  Minimum: 0  (3.74)  (0.74)  1.38   2.32   0.28   1.39  \nDebt-Service Ratio (times)  Minimum: 1.3  0.38   0.68   1.21   1.51   1.21   1.44  \nReceivables (months of sales)  Maximum: 2  1.80   1.90   2.30  3.10   2.60   2.70  \nmonths \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FY = fiscal year.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nB.  Projected Financial Performance \n9.  Financial projections have been prepared for EPC for the FY2007\u2013FY2017 period. The \nassumptions and analysis are detailed in Supplementary Appendix H. Assuming that oil prices \nremain at $60 per barrel (bbl) in constant prices, the financial projections indicate a need for two \ntariff  increases  of  10%  each  over  the  FY2008\u2013FY2012  period.  These  tariff  increases  will \ngenerate the additional cash flow needed to cover operating expenses, debt service, and a \nportion of the counterpart funding for the investment plan. The first increase, which would need \nto be implemented by early 2009, would raise the average tariff from its present level of ST0.77 \nper kWh ($0.30 per kWh) to ST0.85 per kWh ($0.33 per kWh). The second increase of 10% in \nearly  2012  would  raise  the  average  tariff  to ST0.94  per  kWh  ($0.37  per  kWh).  Once  the \nregulatory agency is established and becomes fully operational, a mechanism for regular tariff \nreviews and adjustments will be in place. Therefore, beyond 2012, smaller annual increases of \njust over 5% per year (equivalent to real increases of about 2% annually) are assumed to be \nimplemented. \n \n10.  Cash Generation. EPC\u2019s financial performance is projected to be satisfactory provided \nthat required tariff increases are implemented and collection performance improves. Operating \nnet cash flows are projected to almost double from ST14.7 million ($5.8 million) in FY2006 to \nST26.2 million ($10.3 million) by FY2015. Over the initial phase of the investment plan, this cash \nneeds to be allocated largely towards meeting counterpart financing requirements as well as \ndebt  service  on  EPC\u2019s  existing  Government  loan.  As  the  investment  plan is progressively \nimplemented, cash is increasingly allocated to meeting interest and principal repayment on its \nloans to the Government.  \n \n11.  Profitability.  Net  profit  is  projected  to  improve  significantly  over  the  next  3  years, \nincreasing from ST1.4 million ($0.5 million) in FY2006 to ST7.6 million ($3.0 million) in FY2010, \nbecause of the tariff increase in 2009 and continued growth in sales. However, over the next 5 \nyears (2011\u20132015) of the forecast period, net profit is anticipated to be much lower, averaging \n ", "  Appendix 4  43   \nST3.6 million ($1.4 million) per year. This is due to three main factors: (i) tariff increases are \nlimited to a maximum of one every second year; (ii) as the investment plan is implemented, \ninterest and depreciation expenses increase significantly; and (iii) there is a need for real \nincreases in certain expenditure items, such as repairs and maintenance, in order to recover \nfrom past underfunding.  \n \n12.  Counterpart  Financing.  Even  with  the  projected  tariff  increases  and  improved \ncollections, EPC is not expected to have the capacity to provide the entire $20 million equivalent \ncounterpart financing required for the investment plan. It is estimated that EPC will be able to \nprovide  $12  million  of  the  total  counterpart  funding  requirement  over  the  FY2008\u2013FY2015 \ninvestment period. The Government will provide equity injections into EPC to cover the residual \namount of $8 million. About 65% of the Government contribution will be required over the 3-year \nperiod between FY2010 and FY2012. As the benefits from the investment plan are realized, \nrevenue  growth,  in  combination  with  efficiency  improvements,  will  enable  EPC  to  meet  a \nprogressively larger share of counterpart funding. Over the last 3 years of the Project, EPC will \nprovide 75% of the required counterpart funding. \n \n13.  Covenant  Compliance.  The  financial  projections  indicate  that  EPC  can  meet  the \nagreed financial covenants provided that the required tariff increases are implemented together \nwith improved collection performance. EPC will need to carefully assess and monitor its cash \ngeneration in order to ensure that it can comply with the self-financing covenant3 over the \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ninvestment period. EPC\u2019s self-financing capacity will vary from year to year, depending on its \ncash  generation  and  on  the  size  of  the  capital  investments  in  each  year.  Although  cash \ngeneration will generally improve over the forecast period, the self-financing ratio (SFR) will be \nweakest between FY2011 and FY2013. The SFR is projected to be 12% in FY2013, the peak \ninvestment year, and 19% in both FY2011 and FY2012. As operating cash flows continue to \nimprove and as capital expenditures decline beyond FY2015, the self-financing capacity should \nimprove to meet an SFR of at least 20%. \n \n14.  Improved cash generation should enable EPC to comply with the debt-service ratio \n(DSR)  covenant  in  each  year  over  the  forecast  period  provided  that  tariff  increases  are \nimplemented. Prior to the commencement of principal repayments in FY2013, the DSR should \nremain well above the covenanted minimum of 1.3. However, with the commencement of debt \nservice, the DSR is projected to drop to 1.6.  \n \n15.  EPC\u2019s ability to achieve and maintain receivables at or below the covenanted maximum \nof 2 months worth of sales will depend upon its collections performance and the extent to which \nit  writes  off  uncollectible  arrears.  Collections  will  receive  an  immediate  boost  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s agreement to settle a significant portion of its arrears in FY2008. However, EPC \nwill also need to make a large write-off of uncollectible private sector arrears during FY2008 to \nbring receivables down to 2 months of sales. While these immediate steps will address much of \nthe  existing  arrears,  only  significantly  improved  collections  performance  will  maintain \nreceivables at acceptable levels. With the progressive introduction of prepayment metering, \nEPC is projected to be able to improve collections to levels sufficient to maintain its receivables \nat between 1.8 and 2 months over the forecast period.  \n \n                                                 \n3  The covenant for the SFR is 12% for FY2008\u2013FY2015 and 20% for 2016 onwards. \n ", "44  Appendix 4   \nC.  Sensitivity Analysis \n16.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in \nselected key variables on the financial performance of EPC. The variables tested were (i) a \nlower rate of sales growth, (ii) a higher rate of increase in fuel prices, and (iii) a slower rate of \nimprovement in collections performance. The tariffs required to achieve satisfactory financial \nperformance under the tested variables are given in Table A4.3. \n \nTable A4.3: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n(ST per kWh) \n \nExisting  Required Average Tariffs   Total \nScenario  Increasea \nFY2007  FY2009  FY2012  FY2015 \n(%) \nBase Case  0.77  0.85  0.94  1.12  45 \nLower Sales Growthb     0.85  0.95  1.14  48 \nHigher Fuel Pricesc    0.93  1.04  1.26  64 \nLess Improvement in  0.85  0.96  1.18  53 \n \nCollection Performanced \nFY = fiscal year, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  Total increase over FY2007\u2013FY2015 period. \nb  Growth in sales assumed to be 65% of the base case. \nc  Average fuel price based on $75 per barrel. \nd  Collections remain at 95% for both electricity and rechargeable works. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.  The analysis indicates that EPC\u2019s vulnerability to fuel prices has the greatest impact on \ntariffs. Under the base-case, projected fuel prices over the forecast period have been assumed \nto correspond to a world crude oil price of $60 per bbl, expressed in constant 2007 prices. For \nthe sensitivity analysis, fuel prices are assumed to correspond to $75 per bbl, also expressed in \nconstant  2007  prices.  This  higher  cost  of  fuel  would  require  that  EPC\u2019s  average  tariff  be \nincreased by 64% over the FY2007\u2013FY2015 period, compared to 45% under the $60 per bbl \nbase  case.  The  sensitivity  analysis  is  likely  to  underestimate  the  true  impact  on  tariff \nrequirements as higher world oil prices would also increase the general price level of other \ninputs required by EPC. \n \n18.  In all three scenarios assessed under the sensitivity analysis, the key factor driving the \nneed for higher tariffs is the requirement to self-finance a portion of EPC\u2019s capital investment \nplan while also covering operating costs and existing debt-service obligations. Without such \ntariff increases, EPC would not be able to finance its $12 million contribution to the Project.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  45   \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been active in the power sector in Samoa \nsince  1971  when  it  provided  the  first  technical  assistance  (TA)  project.  In  total,  ADB  has \nprovided 14 TA projects and seven loans for power sector development. The Electric Power \nCorporation (EPC) was corporatized in 1972 in the course of ADB\u2019s first power development \nloan to Samoa. ADB has provided financing for two completed hydropower projects and two \nothers for upgrades of diesel generation and transmission projects. The Afulilo hydropower \nproject  was  approved  in  1986.1 The  project  was  cofinanced  by  the  Australian Agency  for \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nInternational Development (AusAID), European Investment Bank, European Union, and the \nWorld Bank. In April 1993, ADB approved supplementary financing2 to meet cost overruns of \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n$2.0 million. The project was successfully commissioned in June 1993. The most recent loan \naimed at the expansion of capacity of the existing Afulilo hydropower projects was cancelled in \n2005  because  of  cost  increases  associated  with  technical  difficulties  and  implementation \ndelays.3 A summary of ADB\u2019s loans to the power sector are summarized in Table A5.1. \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n \nTable A5.1: ADB Loans to the Power Sector  \n \nLoan  Approval  Amount  \nProject \nNo.  Date  ($'000) \n \n    ADB  Government  Cofinancing  Total \n0132  Power Project  19 Jun 1973  2,300      2,300  \n0254  Hydropower  18 Dec 1975  1,400      1,400  \nDevelopment (Western \nSamoa) \n0392  Second Power Project  29 Mar 1979  3,450      3,450  \n0813  Afulilo Hydroelectric  04 Dec 1986  5,400  1,515   10,285   17,200  \nProject \n1019  Emergency Power  17 May 1990  500      500  \nRehabilitation \n1228  Afulilo Hydroelectric  22 Apr 1993  2,000  2,000   2,600   6,600  \nProject (Supplementary \nLoan) \n1886  Power Sector  17 Dec 2001  6,000  1,500      7,500  \nImprovement Projecta \nTotal  21,050  5,015   12,885   38,950  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Part of the loan amount was cancelled.

Samoa has been actively involved in a number of regional initiatives for clean energy in \nthe Pacific, including the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program (REEP).5 Samoa \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nhosts the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). SPREP is an \nintergovernmental agency that provides assistance and technical advisory services to Pacific \nisland countries, territories, and administrations for the protection and sustainable management \nof the environment. It has programs on renewable energy, climate change, and biodiversity \nconservation.  SPREP  also  coordinates  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s \n(UNDP\u2019s) Regional Energy Program for Poverty Reduction. With Global Environment Facility \n(GEF) financing, UNDP also supports the Pacific Islands Greenhouse Gas Abatement through \nthe Renewable Energy Project with SPREP. \n \n4.  Through  UNDP,  the  GEF  has  provided  financing  for  solar  photovoltaic  systems  to \nelectrify villages in the two smaller islands between the main islands of Upolu and Savai\u2019i.  \n \n5.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has,  through  its  volunteer  program, \nprovided technical staff in engineering, and funded computers and equipment for EPC. The \nGovernment of Australia and AusAID have, through its Youth Ambassador and nongovernment \norganization programs, supported the development of a geographical information system for the \ndistribution system and for development of renewable biofuel. EPC has requested AusAID to \ncontinue its ongoing support for (i) activities for demand-side management, (ii) capacity building \nfor  the  establishment  of  a  unit  for  land  acquisition  and  environment  within  EPC,  and  (iii) \ncontinuation of the work on the geographical information system. These activities support the \nPower Sector Expansion Project. \n6.  Donor  coordination  and  consultations  with  AusAID,  GEF,  and JBIC  have  been  key \nfeatures of project preparation. Because of the emphasis on regulatory and governance aspects \nof the power sector in Samoa, the Government of Australia will help finance the regulatory and \npolicy reform component of the TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy. \nDevelopment of the feasible and affordable investment plan and policy dialogue has been \nundertaken with EPC and the Government jointly with AusAID and JBIC. JBIC will provide joint \ncofinancing as the first project under the Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme with ADB.6 The \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nGovernment of Australia will provide a grant as joint cofinancing for the Project to address \naffordability of counterpart financing requirements, which is a particular issue for EPC in the \nearly years of the investment plan. Initial consultations have been undertaken with GEF on the \nclean  energy  fund.  The  consultations  will  continue  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the \nestablishment of the clean energy fund, the clean development mechanism subfund, and the \ndesignated national authority. \n \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

The TA cluster supports the Government\u2019s priorities for the power sector through four \ncomponents: Component 1 comprises the establishment of a CEF and a clean development \nmechanism  (CDM)  subfund;  Component  2  will  establish  and  build  capacity  of  a  DNA; \nComponent 3 will support the Government in undertaking regulatory and policy reform in the \npower sector; Component 4 will provide RFMAs to EPC. Capacity building and stakeholder \nconsultations are integral parts of all components. \n \n4.  Component 1: Establishment of the CEF. The CEF will help improve the coordination \nof financing sources for clean energy resources in Samoa and is envisaged as a revolving fund. \nComponent 1 will (i) help establish the governance and operational structure, human resources, \nand working and reporting guidelines of the CEF and a CDM subfund, (ii) identify a project \npipeline, and (iii) increase public awareness on clean and renewable energy. The CDM subfund \nwill help finance initial transactions costs associated with getting eligible projects additional \nfinancing under the CDM. This may include preparation of project design documents, validation \nof project design documents by an operational entity or independent third party validator, and \nregistration of projects with the CDM executive board.   \n \n5.  Component  2:  Establishment  of,  and  Capacity  Building  for,  the  DNA.  The \nestablishment of a DNA will enable Samoa to benefit from the CDM. Component 2, which will be \nimplemented jointly with Component 1 to ensure that the two components are well coordinated, \nwill,  through  a  consultative  process;  (i)  establish  the  operational  structure  and  resource \nrequirements; (ii) develop working guidelines and procedures for the DNA, (iii) provide capacity \nbuilding and hands-on training for stakeholders and DNA staff in procedural requirements using \na pilot project (identified in the project pipeline under Component 1); and (iv) raise public \nawareness on the role, functions, and requirements of the DNA.    \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 July 2007. \n2  ADB. 2007.

Component 3 \ncomprises  support  for  the  development  of  (i)  a  demand-side  management  and  energy \nconservation strategy, (ii) a legal framework to govern all stakeholders in the power sector, and \n(iii) the establishment of a regulator. The demand-side management and energy conservation \nstrategy will focus on the policy environment and tax incentives to promote energy efficiency. \nSupport to regulatory reform will be implemented in three phases allowing for stakeholder \nconsultation and political decision processes. The first phase will focus on the scoping of a \nregulatory framework that will allow the Government to make a decision in principle on the roles, \nfunctions, and structure of a regulatory agency, including the independence, authority for tariff \nregulation, and accountability of the regulator and the scope for multisector regulation. The first \nphase  will  guide  the  direction  of  subsequent  phases.  Phase  2  will  develop  the  regulatory \nframework, including the drafting of new legislation and amendments to existing legislation for \nconsideration by cabinet and parliament and the preparation of a detailed budget and resource \nassessment for approval in the forthcoming budget year. Once the Government has approved \nthe legislation and the budget of the regulator, recruitment of a suitable regulator and initial \ncapacity building and the development of working guidelines of the regulator can commence.  \n \n7.  Component  4:  RFMAs  to  the  Electric  Power  Corporation.  Two  RFMAs  (one \naccountant and one analyst) will be engaged to assist EPC in (i) improving internal budgeting \nand expenditure controls; (ii) consolidating accounts and financial reporting and forecasts to the \nEPC board, the Government, and ADB; and (iii) developing peak and off-peak tariffs and bulk \npurchase agreements with EPC\u2019s major customers. Capacity building and training is an integral \ntask of all aspects of the work. Component 4 will help EPC (i) improve longer-term least-cost \nplanning;  (ii)  ensure  that  investments  are  affordable  and  contribute  to  improving  financial \nsustainability; and (iii) improve the transparency of costs, tariff setting, and accountability to the \nGovernment and consumers.   \n \n8.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  cluster  is  estimated  to  be  $2,185,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $1,850,000 equivalent. Table A11.1 shows the \nfinancing by component. The equivalent of $350,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Finland; $900,000 equivalent will be financed by the Government of Australia; \n$600,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of Samoa will finance office accommodation, and \nremuneration and per diem of counterpart staff in the equivalent of $335,000.  \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nTable A11: Financing by Technical Assistance Cluster Component \n \nFinancing \nTechnical Assistance Cluster \nAmount  Counterpart  Amount \nComponent  External Source \n($'000)  Financing  ($'000) \nEstablishment of a Clean Energy  Government of  350  Government of  65 \nFund  Finland  Samoa \n \nEstablishment of, and Capacity  Japan Special Fund  150  Government of  30 \nBuilding for, the Designated    Samoa \nNational Authority \n \nRegulatory and Policy Reform in  Government of  900  Government of  160 \nthe Power Sector  Australia  Samoa \n \nResident Financial Management  Japan Special Fund  450  Government of  80 \nAdvisors to the Electric Power      Samoa \nCorporation \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n9.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the TA cluster and has \nassigned the Energy Unit of the MOF as the implementing agency for components 1, 2, and 3. \nThe  Energy  Unit  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  consultants  and  facilitate \ncoordination of activities, training, and workshops. Counterpart staff has been assigned from the \nattorney general\u2019s office for drafting of legislation under Component 3. The attorney general will \nbe responsible for submission of draft legislation to cabinet and for parliamentary consideration. \nEPC has been assigned as the implementing agency for Component 4 and will provide office \nspace and counterpart staff for the RFMAs. The chief executive officer of MOF will provide \noverall strategic guidance for the TA cluster components and facilitate submission of draft \ncabinet papers.   \n \n10.  A total of 42.5 person-months of consulting services will be required to implement the TA \ncluster. To improve coordination and take advantage of the synergies between components 1 \nand 2, one firm will be engaged to provide 14.5 person-months of consulting services for \ncomponents 1 and 2 on an intermittent basis over a period of 12 months. One firm will be \nengaged under Component 3 to provide 18 person-months of intermittent consulting services \nover a period of 20 months, and two individual consultants will be engaged under Component 4 \nto provide 10 person-months of consulting services on an intermittent basis to EPC over a \nperiod of 2 years commencing in February 2008.  \n    \n ", "  Appendix 12  63\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \n1.  Samoa is a small and highly import-dependent country that relies largely on official \ntransfers  and  remittances  for  foreign  currency  revenues.  Despite  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks, the Independent State of Samoa has experienced stable economic growth over the last \n5 years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at around 4% per annum, well above the \naverage growth rate of the Pacific region economies. The annual long-term growth rate is \nexpected to be around 3.5%. Economic growth is mainly driven by agriculture, construction, \nfinance, and business services. Samoa is also benefiting from an increase in tourism. Further \nbroadening  of  economic  activity  and  private  sector  development  are  key  strategies  for \nsustaining economic growth rates and reducing poverty.  \n \n2.  The  Government\u2019s  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2005\u20132007  lays  the \nfoundation for sustainable and broad-based economic growth supported by continued reforms \nand private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in Samoa. Ensuring \nthat sufficient power is available to meet growing demand is essential to achieving a broader \neconomic base and reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. \n \nA.  Power Demand and Supply Balances \n3.  The power sector in Samoa has undergone a rapid transformation over the last decade \ntowards an energy supply based on imported petroleum and hydropower-generated electricity. \nThis  transformation  has  been  driven  by  economic  growth  that  has  resulted  in  increasing \ndemand for electricity and transportation. Energy demand in Samoa is met by three main \nsources: biomass (47%), fossil fuel (45%), and hydropower (8%). Biomass is mainly used for \ncooking whereas imported petroleum is used for transportation and power generation. Imports \nof petroleum products account for 15% of Samoa\u2019s total import expenditure. Power generation \naccounts for about 20% of total imported petroleum. \n \n4.  More than 90% of the country\u2019s electricity demand is on Upolu, which is also the main \nsource of growth in Samoa. Peak electricity demand reached 17.6 megawatts (MW) in 2007. \nAnnual peak demand is expected to grow by 7% in the short term and by 4% beyond 2009 \n(Table A12.1). By 2008, the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) will not be able to reliably meet \ndemand.1 In the short term, EPC will utilize existing self-generation by large consumers to meet \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\npeak  demand.2 By  2010,  the  existing  run-of-the-river  hydropower  station  at  Alaoa  will  be \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nrefurbished and by 2011 EPC will need to commission additional generation capacity to meet \nboth energy and peak demands.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Assumes a reliability criteria of the available capacity minus the capacity of the largest generator. \n2  The capacity of existing self-generation is estimated to be about 8 MW. \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.1: Power Balance - Upolu System  \n(Without-Investment Plan) \n  \nYear  Peak  Total Firm  Firm  Power  Reserve Firm \nDemand  Generation  Capacity at  Balance  Generation \n(MW)  Capacity  N-1 Reserve  at N-1  Capacity \n(MW)  (MW)  (MW)  (MW) \n2002  15.8  24.6  20.5  4.7  8.8 \n2003  15.9  24.6  20.5  4.6  8.7 \n2004  16.2  24.6  20.5  4.3  8.4 \n2005  17.0  24.6  20.5  3.6  7.7 \n2006  17.6  24.6  20.5  3.0  7.1 \n2007  19.7  24.6  20.5  0.9  5.0 \n2008  20.8  24.6  20.5  (0.3)  3.8 \n2009  21.7  24.6  20.3  (1.4)  2.9 \n2010  22.6  22.8  18.5  (4.1)  0.2 \n2011  23.5  22.8  18.5  (5.0)  (0.7) \nMW = megawatt, N-1 = total generation capacity minus the largest generator.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank (ADB) and EPC. \n \n5.  Peak demand on Savai\u2019i is expected to grow by 4% annually to 2009. With a longer-term \ngrowth in peak demand of 3%, the existing diesel power station at Salalologa is estimated to \nmeet  capacity  and  annual  energy  requirements  until  2015,  when  a  0.4  MW  generator  is \nscheduled for retirement. A power factor improvement project has been scheduled for 2010 to \nimprove operational efficiency. A hydropower development, scheduled for commissioning in \n2015, is a key priority to reduce diesel consumption on Savai\u2019i. If the proposed hydropower \ndevelopment project can be commissioned, 81% of energy requirements on Savai\u2019i can be met \nfrom renewable resources in 2015. The Project will also reduce noise and pollution from the \npower station.  \n \nB.  Investment Plan \n6.  The  investment  plan  covers  the  two  power  systems  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i.  EPC\u2019s \ninvestment plan will meet forecast demand requirements up until 2019, when new capacity will \nbe required on Upolu, and help EPC improve its collection performance through the installation \nof prepayment meters. The investment plan comprises three generation and nine transmission \nprojects on Upolu, and one generation and three transmission projects on Savai\u2019i. Investment in \nsingle- and three-phase prepayment meters, system control and data acquisition (SCADA), and \nportable equipment for measuring voltage and current and for stream-flow gauging are included \nfor both the Upolu and Savai\u2019i power systems.  \n \n7.  Identified generation projects are based on analysis of the power and energy balances \nfor each of the power systems. Investments in the transmission networks are driven by the need \nto improve reliability, reduce losses, and meet peak requirements, and have been identified \nbased on detailed load-flow analysis of the performance of individual transmission lines, and the \nsystem as a whole. The timing of investments in generation on Upolu is initially driven by peak \ncapacity requirements. The existing generation capacity can meet energy requirements to 2013 \n ", "  Appendix 12  65\nwhen a 1.3 gigawatt-hour (GWh) shortfall is expected.3 Investment in hydropower generation on \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nSavai\u2019i aims to replace fuel costs of the existing power station at Salalologa. The timing of \ncommissioning of the hydropower project is determined based on the need for adequate time to \naddress community concerns, and the financial and implementation capacity of EPC.  \n \n8.  Projects under the investment plan are prioritized to improve reliability and security of \npower supply to the main load center in Apia and to improve EPC\u2019s revenue collection. EPC \nplans to improve utilization of the existing transmission system, and reliability of supply, by \nreplacing the existing 6.6 kilovolt (kV) overhead transmission lines with a 22 kV underground \ncable.  This  is  the  first  phase  of  a  three-phase  underground  program  that  aims  to  secure \nelectricity supply to the main load centers and the hospital, and protect the key transmission \nlines against cyclone damage. The underground program is expected to be fully completed by \n2013. EPC\u2019s revenue collection will be improved through the installation of prepayment meters \nto all consumers on Upolu and Savai\u2019i. The supply, installation, and operation of the SCADA \nsystem will enhance the control systems and improve operational system efficiency on both \nSavai\u2019i and Upolu. Transmission upgrades and expansion of the low voltage distribution network \nwill take place throughout the investment plan, commencing in 2008. EPC\u2019s investment plan is \ndetailed in Appendix 3 and Supplementary Appendix G.       \n \nC.  Least-Cost Analysis \n9.  Projects under the investment plan were included and sequenced to account for EPC\u2019s \nfinancial  and  implementation  capacity.  Feasible  alternatives  for  the  proposed  generation \nprojects  are  limited.  The  generation  projects  included  for  expansion  on  Upolu  include  the \nrefurbishment of the existing 1 MW Alaoa hydropower station by 2010 and a new 12.9 MW \ndiesel power station for which commissioning of three 4.3 MW diesel generators would be \nsequenced between 2011 and 2014. Up until 2011, EPC may face capacity shortages in reliably \nmeeting peak demand during the dry season. Utilization of existing stand-by self-generation \ncapacity enables EPC to manage the risk of capacity shortages until adequate transmission \ncapacity has been commissioned. Two possible hydropower sites at Lotofagauta and Tia'vea \nwere identified on Upolu. However, given technical, capacity, cost, and social uncertainties with \nthese projects, they were not included in EPC\u2019s investment plan for 2008\u20132015.  \n \n10.  A least-cost analysis for generation options on Savai\u2019i was undertaken to ascertain \nwhether the proposed 1 MW firm capacity run-of-the-river hydropower scheme would represent \nthe least economic cost option for meeting demand to 2030. The capital costs include cost for \nresettlement and land acquisition. Taxes, duties, and value-added government sales tax were \nexcluded for all capital, insurance, and operations and maintenance costs.  \n \n11.  Average  annual  output  is  estimated  at  11.8  GWh,  which  would  provide  96%  of \ngeneration requirements on Savai\u2019i in 2015. With demand growth, the share of hydropower \nwould reduce to 75% by 2020. The balance of generation requirements would be met by the \nexisting diesel power station, which would mostly be used to meet peak demand. The hydro-\ndiesel mix option was compared to a diesel-only option, where the existing power station would \nbe maintained to meet demand growth to 2030. Commencing in 2015, 3,355 tons (t) of diesel \nfuel would be saved annually; by 2017, savings would increase to 3,446 t annually. The result of \nthe least-cost analysis is presented in Table A12.2. The results of the sensitivity analysis \n                                                 \n3  This energy balance deficit assumes that transmission investments are undertaken as per the investment plan to \nreduce system losses.  \n ", "66  Appendix 12 \nsuggest that the hydro-diesel mix option would become unviable at an international oil price \nabout $53.5 per barrel (bbl), equivalent of an economic cost of ST1.316 per liter (l).  \n \nTable A12.2: Least-Cost Analysis \n \nFuel Price  Hydro-Diesel Mix (NPV)  Diesel Only (NPV) \nInternational Price  Economic Cost of Diesel \n$   ST per  $  ST \nof Crude Oil   in Samoa  \nper kWh  kWh  per kWh  per kWh \n($ per bbl)  (ST per liter) \n45  1.113  0.176  0.449  0.167  0.425 \n60  1.470  0.209  0.532  0.215  0.549 \n75  1.835  0.242  0.618  0.267  0.680 \nBbl = barrel, kWh = kilowatt-hour, NPV = net present value, ST = Samoan tala. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12.  The underground cabling program on Upolu aims at enhancing transmission capacity \nand improving reliability to the main load centers in Apia, the industrial area at Vailima, and the \nhospital. The program will commence in 2008 and be fully completed by the end of 2014. It \nincludes (i) two stages of upgrading and underground cabling of the existing 6.9 kilometers (km) \nof the Hospital Feeder (1.1 km of which is currently underground), (ii) upgrading the capacity \nand underground cabling of the Vaitele Feeder, and (iii) underground cabling of a new 22 kV \ntransmission line from the proposed Vaitele Substation to the wharf area and through the \nindustrial area at Vailima to the airport.  \n \n13.  The first stage of the Hospital Feeder upgrade will improve utilization of the Vaitele \nFeeder and reduce the load on the Hospital Feeder. Load-flow analysis show that the Hospital \nFeeder is currently experiencing overloads and voltage drops, and is increasingly becoming a \nbottleneck to reliable electricity supply both to Apia\u2019s main commercial and government district \nand to the hospital. By 2011, overloading on this transmission line will be 30% and the voltage \ndrops will have increased from 11% in 2006 to 20% by 2016, when the overloading will be about \n70%. Losses are estimated to increase from 6% in 2006 to 11% by 2016.  \n \n14.  Since the early 1990s, Samoa has experienced four serious cyclones. The two cyclones \nin the early 1990s caused damage estimated at $120 million (26% of GDP) and $200 million \n(46% of GDP). With global warming, the incidence and severity of cyclones can be expected to \nincrease in the future. The 2004 cyclone caused damage to key infrastructure assets alone \nestimated at $25 million, excluding the cost to the power sector and impacts on economic \nactivity. EPC estimated the cost of damage to power sector assets at $2.8 million in addition to \na loss of 2.73% of total sales for 2004.  \n \n15.  The difference in economic net present value costs for the underground cabling program \nversus overhead transmission lines is $4.04 million. Assuming that the costs of damage from a \ncyclone would amount to 25% of the investment cost in overhead transmission lines, it would \ntake about two cyclone events for the underground program to become least cost. Cost saving \nassociated  with  the  longer  economic  life  of  underground  cables,  reduced  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, and loss of economic production and activity, including the opportunity cost \nof self-generation caused by disruptions in power supply associated with cyclone damage, have \nbeen excluded from the analysis. Underground cabling of key transmission lines forms part of \nthe  Government\u2019s  national  risk  management  strategy  to  improve  resilience  against  natural \nhazards and climate change.   \n ", "  Appendix 12  67\n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n16.  As subprojects included under the investment plan are not stand-alone investments that \nyield benefits in isolation from other investments, the economic analysis was undertaken for \nEPC\u2019s two power systems on Upolu and Savai\u2019i using a time-slice approach. The analysis is \nconducted from 2008 to 2030 with an investment period from 2008 to 2015. The economic \ncapital costs include investment costs and costs for project management and implementation, \nenvironment  management  and  mitigation,  and  resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  It  was \nassumed that the economic opportunity cost of land is 25% of the financial compensation.   \n \n17.  The net economic benefits for the two power systems on Upolu and Savai\u2019i were derived \nby comparing the performance of the power systems on Upolu and Savai\u2019i under a with-\ninvestment plan scenario and a without-investment plan scenario. On Upolu, 97% of the capital \ncost  for  prepayment  meters  and  78%  of  the  SCADA  costs  and  project  management  and \nimplementation were allocated to the system, with the remaining 3% of the capital cost for \nprepayment meters and 12% of SCADA costs and project management and implementation \nallocated to Savai\u2019i. It was assumed that EPC staff costs (the second largest operation and \nmaintenance  cost  after  fuel)  would  remain  the  same  under  both  the  with-investment  and \nwithout-investment scenarios.  \n \n18.  In the absence of an investment plan on Upolu, the economic analysis assumes that \nEPC would serve demand from its existing generation capacity. Unserved demand initially \nrepresents  deficits  in  peak  capacity.  The  transmission  system  will  become  an  increasing \nhindrance  to  power  supply  to  consumers  and  system  losses  will  increase  until generation \ncapacity reached its maximum output in 2017.4 With increased system losses and growing \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ndemand,  energy  deficits  will  commence  in  2013.  Incremental  benefits  were  valued  at  the \nwillingness to pay, estimated at ST0.99 per kWh.5 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfor the investments on Upolu is estimated at 13.6%. Benefits which are difficult to quantify, such \nas those associated with the noise and emission control program at the Tanugamanono power \nstation and with protection of transmission lines against climate change, have not been included \nin the analysis. The result is most sensitive to the estimated capital costs, followed by the \nassumptions of benefits. Capital cost increases of more than 14% would make the EIRR fall \nbelow 12%. A 20% reduction in benefits would reduce the EIRR to just below 12%.  \n \n19.  The with-investment scenario on Savai\u2019i would yield benefits associated with reduced \nfuel and operation and maintenance costs and an annual economic benefit of $45,000 in \ncarbon-market credits associated with the reduced diesel usage resulting from the hydropower \nproject. The without-investment scenario assumes that no new investments will take place on \nSavai\u2019i. Demand would be met by the existing diesel power station at increased fuel and \noperation and maintenance costs. The calculations do not include benefits associated with \nreduction of noise and fumes from the existing power station at Salalologa. The analysis under \nthe base-case fuel price (the equivalent of $60 per bbl) yields an EIRR of 10.7%. The result is \nmost sensitive to changes in operation and maintenance costs followed by capital costs. If the \ninternational oil price over the period averaged $67 per bbl, the EIRR increases to 12%. A \ncapital cost increase of more than 4% would reduce the EIRR to below 10%. The details of the \neconomic analysis are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n                                                 \n4  The existing overhead lines to main load centers in Apia would also remain vulnerable to cyclones. \n5  The methodology for calculating the willingness to pay followed the approach outlined in ADB\u2019s Economics and \nResearch Department Technical Note No.3, Measuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity. The estimated weighted \naverage willingness to pay for domestic and nondomestic consumers is ST0.99 ($0.388) per kWh. \n ", "68  Appendix 12 \n \nE.  Financial Analysis \n20.  The financial analysis was undertaken based on a comparison of the financial costs and \nbenefits associated with the investment plan for the two separate power systems on Upolu and \nSavai\u2019i. Financial benefits comprise (i) projected revenue based on tariff projections, (ii) load \nforecasts, and (iii) estimated carbon credits of $45,000 per year. The incremental financial costs \ncomprise capital, operation and maintenance (including fuel), and system losses. Financial \nbenefits and costs were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated \nat 4.5% (Table A12.3). The WACC is calculated in real terms for EPC\u2019s investments for 2008\u2013\n2015. The financing sources comprise EPC\u2019s equity contributions (financed through retained \nearnings), the Government\u2019s equity contributions (financed by the Government of Australia), and \nforeign exchange loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) relent to EPC in local currency at an interest rate of 6.5%. The \ncost of EPC\u2019s equity is estimated at 15.2% on the basis of a risk-free rate of 9.6% of New \nZealand dollar denominated bonds issued by the Government of New Zealand, and adjusted for \nSamoa. Assumptions underlying the WACC computations include that EPC will not be required \nto pay tax, and an average domestic inflation of 3.6%.  \n \nTable A12.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nGovernment   \nGovernment and \nItem   Relending of Loans  Total \nEPC Equity \nADB  JBIC \nAmount ($ million)  42  38  20  100 \nWeighting (%)  42.00  38.00  20.00  100 \nNominal Cost (%)  6.50  6.50  15.20    \nTax Rate (%)  0.00  0.00  0.00    \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost (%)  6.50  6.50  15.15    \nInflation Rate (%)  3.58  3.58  3.58    \nReal Cost (%)  2.82  2.82  11.16    \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (%)  1.18  1.07  2.23  4.48\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = Electric Power Corporation, JBIC = Japan Bank for International \nCooperation. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n21.  The financial net present values discounted at the WACC for the investment plan is \nST44.1 million ($17.3 million) for the investments on Upolu and ST27.9 million ($10.9 million) for \nSavai\u2019i. The financial rates of returns are 7.0% for Upolu and 12.1% for Savai\u2019i. The financial \nresult for Upolu is most sensitive to an increase in capital costs, followed by a reduction in \nbenefits (sales). The investment plan would remain financially viable if capital cost increases do \nnot exceed 31%. The financial result for Savai\u2019i is most sensitive to changes in fuel prices, but \nthe international oil price would need to drop to below $27 per bbl to undermine financial \nviability.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Samoa: \nDespite vulnerability to external shocks, the Independent State of Samoa has experienced stable economic growth \nover the last 5 years. Real gross domestic product grew at around 4% per annum, well above the average growth rate \nof the Pacific region economies. Economic growth is mainly driven by agriculture, construction, finance, and business \nservices. Samoa is also benefiting from an increase in tourism. Further broadening of economic activity and private \nsector development are key strategies for sustaining economic growth rates and reducing poverty. The Government\u2019s \nStrategy for the Development of Samoa 2005\u20132007 lays the foundation for sustainable and broad-based economic \ngrowth supported by continued reforms and private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in \nSamoa. Ensuring that sufficient power is available to meet growing demand is essential to achieving a broader \neconomic base and reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. \n \nWith the rural electrification program nearing completion, 95% of the population has access to electricity. Good \nperformance of the power sector and reliable electricity services are vital for promoting private sector investments to \ndiversify the economy and achieve sustainable economic growth. Electricity is also an intermediate input to the \nprovision of basic social services, including health, education, and water supply. Inadequate and unreliable power \nsupply is an increasing hindrance to economic growth and is affecting all consumers in Samoa. Poor people are \ndisproportionately affected by poor reliability and quality of power supply, and by inefficiencies in the power sector.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe 2002 Household Income Expenditure Survey shows that a high proportion of households use electricity as a main \nsource  of  lighting.  The  average  household  consumption  is  76  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  month  and  electricity \nexpenditure accounts for about 4% of average household expenditure in Samoa. Affordability of appliances is the \nmajor determinant of electricity demand, and electricity consumption is strongly correlated with income. Poor people \ntypically spend comparatively more on electricity but generally consume small amounts of electricity for basic lighting \nand an electric fan. Access to the electricity grid has had significant expenditure-reducing effects for poor households, \nand this has allowed them to become more energy efficient. However, with deteriorating quality and reliability of \nsupply, the impact on poor households is disproportional as appliances need to be replaced more often.  \n \nThe Electric Power Corporation\u2019s (EPC) investment plan includes prepayment meters for all consumers on Savai\u2019i and \nUpolu. Prepayment meters allow households to be more aware of their electricity consumption and better manage \ntheir consumption to match income streams. EPC has so far installed 1,200 prepayment meters on Upolu and social \nacceptance is high.  \n \nA rapid social assessment (RSA) was conducted within the Sili area on the south coast of Savai'i. Community \nparticipation through key respondent interviews and focus-group discussions in the project areas highlighted several \nmajor perceived sector issues. \n(i) Electricity is a major cost to most households in Savai'i. RSA survey data analysis showed that households on \nSavai'i allocate on average 10% of monthly income to purchase electricity. Of the residential households surveyed, \n32% stated that they are unable to pay electricity bills on time due to household cash flow constraints, and 14% had \nhad their electricity supply disconnected due to late payment. A number of households (16%) stated that their \nneighbors had opted not to reconnect the electricity supply as they are unable to pay their monthly electricity bills. \n(ii) The majority of residential and commercial consumers (67%) rated the quality of EPC\u2019s services as good, 31% \nrated EPC's service as average, and 2% were dissatisfied. Survey respondents expressed concern over the growing \nfrequency of electricity supply interruptions and 84% stated that the quality of electricity services on Savai'i needs to \nimprove. During the second half of 2006, there were 32 power supply interruptions which lasted for an average of 40 \nminutes each. \n(iii) About 97.3% of the RSA respondents agreed that electricity is important to households and businesses because of \nthe benefits provided by electricity and its contribution to the maintenance of peace and order in the villages through \nthe provision of street lighting. Most households surveyed (74%) stated that they were unwilling to pay high electricity \ntariffs for improved electricity services. \n(iv) Perceived benefits of the electrical services include (a) prolonging the study time of school children, (b) savings on \nexpenses and making household chores convenient, (c) enjoyment in watching television programs or listening to \nradio programs, and (d) enhancement of skills which are dependent on electricity, such as refrigeration and electronic \nrepairs and steel fabrication. \n ", "70  Appendix 13 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was prepared as part of the community and household consultations for the Vaita'i Hydropower \nSubproject. A physical scale model was displayed to the communities and used to explain the impacts of the Vaita'i \nhydropower project during a series of community meetings undertaken in March 2007. A project information booklet \nwas provided in the Samoan language to ensure that the impacts of the project could be clearly understood. Separate \nconsultations were also undertaken with women. In general, affected people responded positively to the project but \nconsensus has not been reached. Therefore, the project is postponed until 2013 or until such time as the communities \naccept the project. Until acceptable renewable generation sources can be developed on Savai\u2019i, the people of Savai\u2019i \nwill have access to electricity supplied from the existing diesel power station at Salalologa. EPC\u2019s investment plan \nincludes a control system and a power factor improvement project for the power system on Savai\u2019i. This is expected to \nlead to improvements in quality and reliability of electricity supply provided that existing diesel generators are operated \nand maintained adequately.  \n \nCandidate subprojects will require community acceptance prior to implementation. An environmental and social unit \nwill be formed within EPC and will operate within the project management unit. The environmental and social unit will \nbe responsible for stakeholder consultations and manage project environmental, land acquisition, and resettlement \nactivities. Project information booklets will be prepared for each candidate subproject and disclosed to affected people \nin the wider community. \n \nFurther stakeholder analysis will be undertaken as part of the power sector reform in order to fully understand and \ntake into account the views, interests, and impacts on all stakeholder groups. This analysis will be supported through \nthe technical assistance (TA) cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe participation strategy outlining the community consultation and participation framework for the Power Sector \nExpansion Project is included in the land acquisition and resettlement framework. EPC consults with landowners prior \nto land acquisition. Representatives from EPC inform the affected parties, in advance, of EPC\u2019s intention to acquire \nland and compensation matters. Further consultations take place during and after detailed design and prior to the \npreparation  of  a  full  census  of  affected  people  and  inventory  of  losses.  The  subproject  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans will be made available to affected people. The objectives of the subproject, the amount of land \nrequired, compensation entitlements, and grievance redress mechanisms will be disclosed to affected people in the \nlocal language.  \n \nThe TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy incorporates the preparation and implementation \nof stakeholder participation and consultations into the reform process and awareness-building for development of \nrenewables. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nCurrently, no specific adverse impacts to women are foreseen. The development of subprojects involves community \nconsultations and EPC will actively encourage representation by women at all public meetings to ensure that women \n(i) fully understand the subproject and its benefits, (ii) become involved in collective decision making, and (iii) raise the \nissues and concerns affecting them in respect to the subproject and identify suitable mitigation measures to address \nconcerns. \n \nSocial investigations show that poor and vulnerable groups are adequately catered for within traditional Samoan \nsociety and will receive an equitable share of any compensation. No specific remedial actions are thought necessary. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No: No Adverse gender impacts are foreseen. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  71 \n \n \nE.
