The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Improving  SPS  Handling  in  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Trade,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the loans and grant, I acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  institutions  and  operational  and  management  capacities  in \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  for  operating  cost-effective  SPS  systems  that  facilitate  trade  and \nprotect  health.2  The  project  will  focus  on  GMS  trade  in  agriculture,  food,  and  forestry  (AFF) \nproducts  for  which  SPS  measures  for  plant  health,  animal  health,  and  food  safety  apply.  The \nproject  will  establish,  strengthen,  and  implement  (i)  surveillance  and  inspection  programs  for \nplant  health,  animal  health,  and  food  safety;  (ii)  enhanced  education  levels  and  university \ntraining of SPS specialists; and (iii) regional cooperation and harmonization for SPS measures \nand  practices.  It  will  selectively  strengthen  food  safety  capacities  of  private  food  handling \nenterprises  and  restaurants  in  tourist  areas.  The  project  will  be  implemented  by  the  national \nauthorities in each country. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  focuses  on  connectivity  and \ncompetitiveness.  While  recent  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  have  created  new \nopportunities for trade, GMS governments increasingly realize that weak legal, institutional, and \nadministrative capacities hinder the optimal use of infrastructure and are insufficient to address \ntrade-related  health  hazards.  A  number  of  initiatives  have  been  launched  to  overcome  such \nconstraints,  including  the  GMS  cross-border  transport  agreement.  The  midterm  review  of  the \n10-year (2002\u20132012) GMS strategic framework reaffirmed the importance of trade and transport \nfacilitation initiatives, including strengthened SPS capacity and cooperation. The essential SPS \nissues that need to be resolved to meet the development needs of the GMS were identified and \na GMS action plan for SPS arrangements, 2010\u20132015 was formulated.  \n \nTrade  in  AFF  products  among  GMS  countries  amounted  to  $9.27  billion  in  2009.  This \n4. \nconstituted  about  13%  of  intra-GMS  trade.  Total  GMS  AFF  exports  grew  more  than  fourfold \nfrom 2000 to 2009. Nevertheless, because of poor SPS management capacities, market access \nfor a wide range of AFF products from Cambodia and the Lao PDR remains limited, both in the \nGMS  and  globally.  The  governments  of  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  have  not  been  able  to \nprotect  their  crops,  livestock,  and  consumers  against  trade-related  health  hazards  caused  by \nplant  pests,  animal  diseases,  and  food  safety  hazards.  It  is  expected  that,  with  better  SPS \nsystems in place, trade of AFF products from Cambodia and the Lao PDR will increase by about \n10%\u201315% annually. Better SPS systems will also lead to reduced risk of crop, animal products \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB approved the concept note for the project and provided project preparatory TA in 2010. The Viet Nam project \nis under processing and may form part of the regional project under separate approval. SPS measures and issues \nare  defined  in  the  1994  World  Trade  Organization  Subsidiary  Agreement  on  the  Application  of  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary Measures. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nlosses,  and  reduced  incidence  of  food-borne  diseases.  Effective  national  SPS  management \nsystems  are  building  blocks  for  regional  harmonization  and  for  establishing  trust  among  GMS \ncountries in each other\u2019s SPS measures.3 \n \nThere  is  lack  of  human  resource  capacity  to  (i)  undertake  surveys  on  crop  pests  and \n5. \ndiseases,  (ii)  manage  inspections  and  interceptions  of  imported  products,  (iii)  monitor  the \nagricultural pesticide trade, (iv) understand the risks of forest pest spread associated with trade \nin  wood  and  forest  products,  and  (v)  sustain  and  expand  the  regional  trade  in  crop  products. \nThere is  also  a  need  to (i)  contain transboundary  animal  diseases,  (ii)  improve surveillance of \nveterinary  drugs  and  feed,  (iii)  maintain  animal  food  product  safety,  and  (iv)  improve  border \nclearance  procedures.  Information  on  food  safety  is  scarce,  characterized  by  inadequate \nmonitoring  of  food,  food  establishments  and  food  poisoning  outbreaks.  Although  tourism  in \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  is  rapidly  growing,  it  is  vulnerable  without  adequate  food  safety \nsupervision.  \n \n6. \nCompliance  with  global  SPS  requirements  requires  national  specialists  to  undertake \ntasks  related  to  surveillance,  risk  analysis,  testing,  diagnostics,  pest  identification,  standards, \nand conformity assessment. Trading partners and private companies often require application of \ngood agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, and quality assurance management \n(such  as  hazard  analysis  critical  control  points).  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  lack  specialists \nwho can perform these tasks. These specialists need to come (in part at least) from graduates \nof national higher education systems that train SPS specialists. Strengthening capacities of SPS \nagencies  is  urgently  needed  to  meet  the  increasing  requirements  for  exports  and  trade \nfacilitation, and to protect health. \n \n7. \nPolicy  and  sector  relevance.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  GMS  10-year  strategic \nframework, 2012\u20132022 and supports the thrust to facilitate cross-border trade and investment. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  pillar  4  (cooperation  in  regional  public  goods)  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation  and  Integration  Strategy.4  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  targets  of  the  National \nStrategic Development Plan Update, 2009\u20132013 of Cambodia and the National Socio Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  VII,  2011\u20132015  of  the  Lao  PDR.  Improving  SPS  management  is  explicitly \nreflected in various Cambodia and Lao PDR sector strategies and plans, and in the GMS core \nagriculture support program. \n\n \n8. \nLessons from trade facilitation and sanitary and phytosanitary development. Trade \nfacilitation remains a challenging agenda in the GMS. Previous experience shows the need to \nadopt  a  phased  approach  to  formulate  well-targeted  and  sequenced  projects  to  ensure \nimplementation  of  bilateral  and  regional  commitments  on  cooperation  and  harmonization. \nInadequate  capacities  at  the  country  level  are  major  constraints  for  effective  regional \ncooperation in SPS arrangements. Development partners, such as the United Nations agencies, \nthe World Bank and bilateral agencies support various aspects of SPS capacity building in the \nGMS,  but  ongoing  projects  have  not  addressed  SPS  issues  in  a  comprehensive  manner. \nPreparatory  work  has  been  firmly  anchored  in  the  lessons  of  international  experiences  that \nstress the need for prevention rather than end-of-pipe controls, which have proven to be costly \nand  frequently  ineffective.  Involvement  of  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  in  SPS  capacity \nbuilding is necessary to ensure the right technical issues and challenges are addressed and for \nlonger-term  sustainability.  During  the  project  preparation  phase,  workshops  to  consult  the \n\n                                                \n3  Implementation  progress  of  the  proposed  loans,  grant,  and  TA  will  be  reported  to  the  cross-border  transport   \n\nagreement subcommittee on health. \n\n4  Asian  Development  Bank.  2006.

Likewise,  coordination  with  the  GMS  working  group  on  agriculture  has \nbeen maintained. \n \nB. \n \n9.  \nThe impact will be Cambodia and Lao PDR AFF products that are safer, more efficiently \nproduced, and traded in greater quantities. The outcome will be an enhanced SPS management \nsystem  in  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR,  which  will  contribute  to  intraregional  trade,  export \ncompetitiveness, and health protection.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1.   \n\nOutput 1: Strengthened Surveillance and Inspection Programs \n\n \n \n10. \nPlant  health.  Investments  will  focus  on  (i)  conducting  systematic  surveillance  and \ngathering and managing survey-based data; (ii) strengthening diagnostic and analytical services \nthrough technical regulations and investments in laboratory facilities, equipment, supplies, and \nhuman resources; (iii) improving international reporting of pest situations; (iv) conducting forest \npest analysis to enable better understanding and management of forest health and associated \nSPS  compliance;  (v)  introducing  risk-based  approaches  to  plant  imports;  and  (vi)  in  the \nLao PDR, strengthening the supply chains associated with crop products (initially corn, followed \nby rice) for growing regional markets, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).   \n \n11. \nAnimal  health. The focus will be on strengthening surveillance programs  by improving \ntesting, diagnostic, and response capacity for priority  transboundary animal diseases (foot and \nmouth  disease,  classical  swine  fever,  and  in  Cambodia  also  hemorrhagic  septicemia,  and \nporcine  reproductive  and  respiratory  syndrome)  with  field  implementation  on  a  geographically \ntargeted  basis  (i.e.,  border  or  livestock  production  provinces).  In  the  Lao  PDR,  monitoring  the \nsafety  of  veterinary  drugs,  animal feeds,  and  animal  products  will  be  enhanced. In  Cambodia, \ncapacity  to  monitor  veterinary  drug residues  will  be supported.  In  both Cambodia  and  the  Lao \nPDR, the project will promote risk-based import controls. 5 \n \nFood  safety.  The  focus  will  be  on  (i)  designing  and  implementing  annual  programs  of \n12. \nsurveillance,  monitoring,  and  inspection  based  on  known  and  perceived  risks  of  food  safety \nhazards  in  specific  products,  locations,  markets,  hotels,  and  restaurants;  and  (ii)  on  hazard \nresponse capacity, which will include selectively strengthening laboratory capacities. The project \nwill  pursue  improved  food  safety  handling  in  the  tourist  industry  by  promoting  good  hygiene \npractices,  good  manufacturing  practices,  and  enterprise  grading.  Once  grading  systems  have \nbeen established, these services can be delivered by private providers. The project will support \nnational  studies  on  the  possibilities  for  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  to  use  assessments  by \nother GMS countries for first-time market access requests for processed food products.6  Risk-\nbased methods and updated manuals and procedures for controlling imported processed food \nin  line  with  international  recommendations  and  those  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN) will also be introduced.  \n \n\n                                                \n5  Implementation will focus on provinces with international border posts and high levels of transit activity. \n6  Followed by regional consultations to adopt a system for sharing information on first-time access assessments. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n 2.     Output 2: Improved Regional Cooperation and Harmonization \n\n  \n \n13. \nThe project will support Cambodia and the Lao PDR\u2019s active participation in regional fora \nsuch  as  the  Southeast  Asia  and  China  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  project;  International  Food \nSafety  Authorities  Network;  ASEAN  Rapid  Alert  System  for  Food  and  Feed;  and  twinning \narrangements  between  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  other  countries  on  SPS  issues.  The \nproject  will  support  SPS  regional  cooperation  and  harmonization  through  bilateral  working \ngroups (including the  PRC  and Thailand)  in the  areas  of  plant  health,  animal  health,  and food \nsafety.7 It will support the participation of respective national participants in the working groups \nand promote consultation on import handling.  \n \n\n 3.     Output 3: Enhanced Education Levels and University Training of Sanitary \n\nand Phytosanitary Specialists \n\n  \n14. \nThe project will focus on upgrading academic education for SPS specialists by improving \nthe  quality  of  teaching  at  the  Royal  University  of  Agriculture  (Cambodia)  and  the  Faculty  of \nAgriculture at the National University of Laos (with some participation by the University of Health \nSciences).  This  will  cover  (i)  curricula  development,  (ii)  teaching  quality  improvement,  and  (iii) \nlaboratory and teaching facilities upgrading. Where appropriate, the project will promote the use \nof government officials as guest lecturers.  \n \n  \n  \n15. \nfocus  on  establishing  project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  with  support  from  international  and  national  experts  for  SPS \ntechnical  issues  and  for  financial  management  and  procurement.  Component  implementation \nunits will be set up for compiling initial work plans and budgets from respective departments in \nCambodia and the Lao PDR, and for day-to-day liaison on operational matters. PMUs will also \nfacilitate engagement of the private sector and other stakeholders in project activities. \n \nD. \n\n \nOutput 4: Effective Project Management  \n\nProject  management  and  support  services  will \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n4.   \n\n16. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $25.87 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n    A.

The  major  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  (i) \nimproved  SPS  regional  cooperation  and  harmonization,  and  (ii)  effective  monitoring  and \nimplementation of SPS projects. The TA will focus on harmonization of SPS information sharing \nand SPS procedures for plant products, animals, animal products, and food safety. The TA will \nsupport  project  implementation  by  (i)  organizing  joint  training  workshops  of  specialists  in  the \nfood  safety;  (ii) supporting  cross-boundary \nareas  of  plant  health,  animal  health,  and \ncoordination;  and  (iii)  designing  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  for  SPS  capacity \nbuilding.  \n \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  from  August  2012  to  August  2017.  It  is  estimated  to  cost \n22. \n$750,000  and  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund \n(TASF-IV).  The  TA  will  support  10  person-months  of  international  and  30  person-months  of \nnational  consultants\u2019  input,  with  expertise  in  project  management  and  SPS  issues.  The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  to  enable  fast  deployment  and flexibility  to \nundertake TA work. Short-term resource persons will be engaged to support regional meetings \nand training as needed. The activities of the consultants are not interdependent and the timing \nwill be staggered because of the complexity of the project. All consultants and resource persons \nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  work  closely  with \nagencies responsible for SPS measures and coordinating agencies in Cambodia, Lao PDR and \nViet  Nam.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nA  particular  feature  of  project  technical  design  has  been  to  focus  responsibility  for  the \ncomponents  dealing  with  plant  health,  animal  health,  food  safety,  and  academic  education  for \nSPS    capacity  development  firmly  on  the  individual  institutions  in  each  country.  Despite  the \ninstitutional breadth within each component, technical interventions are broadly similar  as they \nfocus  on  strengthening  surveillance  and  inspection  systems  and  upgrading  human  resources, \ninvolving  the  provision  of  a  range of technical  expertise,  training,  workshops,  and hardware  to \nachieve this purpose. \n \n24. \nThe major technical design parameters are (i) a recognition that plant, animal, and food \nsafety  surveillance  systems  start  from  a  low  informational  and  human  capacity  base,  and  that \nenhancing SPS capacity should take a pragmatic and practical approach; (ii) promoting simple \nand cost-effective approaches where possible (e.g., use of rapid test kits, construction of shared \nlaboratory  facilities);  and  (iii)  an  emphasis  on  strengthening  university  teaching  as  opposed  to \nresearch. The project has been designed to complement ongoing and planned interventions by \nvarious  development  partners  and  ADB.  Subregional  cooperation  is  promoted  through \nparticipation  in  regional  SPS  fora,  bilateral  working  groups,  training  attachments,  academic \nexchanges, twinning, etc.  \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nThe  economic  rationale for the  project rests  largely  on  the  \u2015public goods  nature\u2016  of the \ngoods  and  services  to  be  provided.  Without  intervention,  the  operation  of  SPS  systems  and \nmany services, in the GMS will be suboptimum. This is especially the case where \u2015weaker\u2016 or \n\u2015weakest  link technology\u2016  is  involved  and  where the  poorer member  countries (Cambodia and \nthe Lao PDR) lack the capacity to meet relevant international and regional standards for health \nand trade.9  \n \n26. \nAlthough  institutional  strengthening  of  SPS  systems  does  not  easily  lend  itself  to \nquantification  of  economic  impacts,  benefits  to  each  country  are  estimated  to  be    $5 million\u2013\n$10 million annually. Without the project, (i) the majority of Cambodia and Lao PDR AFF trade \nwould  remain  relatively  small-scale,  informal,  and  therefore  unrecorded,  unregulated,  and \nuntaxed.  With  limited  incentives  for  improving  quality  and  safety\u2014trade  would  remain \nunprocessed,  not  suitable  for  value-adding  processes,  and  destined  to  low-end  markets; \n(ii) specific  AFF  export  opportunities  (like  rice,  corn,  fruit,  and  vegetables  to  the  PRC  and  to \nhigh-end markets) would be lost; (iii) Cambodia and the Lao PDR would be at greater risk from \nvarious forms of pest invasions, transboundary animal disease outbreaks, and food safety risks \nfor  consumers,  with  consequent  wider  reputational  implications  for  the  GMS,  especially  in \ntourism; and (iv) Cambodia and the Lao PDR might become destinations for some substandard \nand potentially dangerous agricultural inputs and consumer products in the GMS.  \n \n27. \nThe financial sustainability of the project is particularly important since SPS systems rely \non  recurrent  funding  to  maintain  surveillance  and  testing  systems,  and  opportunities  for  cost \nrecovery  from  the  private  sector  are  limited.10  Recurrent  costs  of  survey  and  other  operations \nare relatively  high (about  20%  of total  project  costs  in  both  Cambodia and  the  Lao PDR). The \nfiscal  implications  have  been  discussed  with  the  respective  governments,  which  acknowledge \nand accept the recurrent cost implications. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n28. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  by  ADB  loan  and  grant  funds  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Project \nimplementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the governments\u2019 \nstandard  operating  procedures.  The  project  accounts  administered  by  the  PMUs  will  be \nconsolidated  and  audited annually  by  auditors  acceptable to  ADB. The  project  will  strengthen \ncapacities  of  staff  in  financial  management  procedures  to  allow  the  efficient  operation  of \nadvance  accounts  and  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the  governments  and  ADB.  The \nproject will establish or use existing ministerial websites to (i) disclose implementation progress \nand  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  (ii)  provide  a  grievance  mechanism  against  any \ncorrupt practice. \n \n\n                                                \n9  Animal  disease  control  and  plant  pest  and  disease  management  across  long  and  porous  borders  are  classic    \nexamples  of  where  subregional  performance  can  be  determined  by  weaker  members\u2019  capacities  because  of \ntransboundary spillover effects. \n\n10  The potential for cost recovery through the charging of fees for services (e.g., testing of feeds, pesticides, food) is     \nlimited in  both countries because of  the  modest size  and  sophistication of  the  private  sector  and  the  absence  of \nregulatory-driven compliance incentives. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith  the  governments.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manuals.11 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  general  intervention  and  does  not  target  poverty  directly. \nHowever, by improving the SPS handling of AFF products in trade, the project will contribute to \nagricultural productivity and help make AFF trade more predictable, transparent, and with lower \ntransaction costs. While there may be some adjustment costs to certain producers, the project \nwill strengthen AFF value chains within and between GMS countries\u2014extending back to the on-\nfarm  production  environment.  This  will  (i)  create  demand  for  on-farm  and  off-farm  labor  and \nprimary  AFF  produce  (i.e.,  agriculture  and  livestock  products),  and  (ii)  support  incomes  and \ngainful employment of poor rural households.12 \n\nAs women dominate agricultural employment in Cambodia and the Lao PDR13 and their \n31. \nparticipation  in  tourist-related  employment  is  high,  they  will  particularly  benefit  from  project \ninvestments. The project is categorized as having some gender benefits. Gender analyses have \nbeen  undertaken  and  selected  gender  targets  (women\u2019s  participation  in  training)  have  been \nidentified and reflected in the legal agreements and the design and monitoring framework.  \n\nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nThe  project  is  classified  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \n\n32. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n33. \nThe  project  does  not  have  a  negative  environmental  impact  and  no  implications  for \nresettlement  of  any  persons:  (i)  civil  works  are  all  small-scale  and  are  on  existing  university \nsites, (ii) no construction activities will take place at border sites, and (iii) all systems upgrading \ntakes place within existing facilities and premises. \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.
