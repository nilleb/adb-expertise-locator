Capacity\nbuilding  for  improved  governance  is  a  critical  factor  for\nachieving \nthe  Government\u2019s  overarching  goal  of\nsustainable poverty reduction. Governance reform is a key\nelement  of  the  Government\u2019s  broader  economic  and\nto  sustain\nreform  program,  which  seeks \nstructural \naccelerated growth and economic stability.\n\nPoor  public  sector  governance  has  contributed  to  a\ndemoralized  bureaucracy,  misallocation  of  budget\nresources,  and  ineffective  implementation  of  development\nprograms.  Increasing  allegations  of  corruption  at  many\nlevels  represent  a  key  constraint  to  effective  delivery  of\nessential  services.  Basic  institutions  essential  to  the\neffective  functioning  of  a  market  economy  do  not  exist  or\ndo  not  operate  effectively.  Poor  governance  and\nperformance  of  public  agencies  waste  limited  public\nresources,  affect  the  quality  and  quantity  of  public  and\nprivate \ninvestment,  constrain  economic  growth,  and\nweaken the Government\u2019s poverty reduction program. The\ncivil  service  also  suffers \nfrom  a  significant  gender\nimbalance.  The  Governance  Reform  Program  will  seek  to\nremove  administrative,  financial,  and  gender  weaknesses\nin  the  civil  service  by  introducing  institutional  reforms  to\nimprove \naccountability,\nredressing  gender\npredictability,  and  processes \nimbalance.\n\ntransparency, \n\nefficiency, \n\nfor \n\nThe overall goal of the Governance Reform Program is to\nestablish  a  civil  service  that  is  more  results-  and  people-\noriented  and  gender  responsive,  and  that  will  contribute\ntowards higher economic growth and reducing poverty.\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  Program  are  to  (i)  develop  internal\ncapacity within the Government to lead and undertake the\ngovernance  reform  agenda,  (ii)  improve  the  efficiency  of\nthe  civil  service,  (iii)  improve  governance  and  reduce\ncorruption \nthe\ncompetence  and  motivation  of  civil  servants,  and  (v)\n\nthe  Government, \n\n(iv)  enhance \n\nin \n\nObjectives\nand Scope\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\n \n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nProcurement\n\niv\n\nestablish  processes  for  improving  performance  in  key\nministries.\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory C\nEnvironmental implications of the Program were reviewed,\nand no significant environmental impacts were identified.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\n23,484,000,  equivalent  to  $30  million,  be  provided  from\nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nthe\nGovernment\u2019s Program. The loan will have a maturity of 24\nyears  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  rate  of\ninterest  will  be  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nto  support \n\nresources \n\nThe  program  period  is  expected  to  be  four  years,  from\nDecember 2001 to December 2005. Disbursements will be\nmade  under  the  simplified  procedures  for  program  loans.\nThe  loan  includes  three  tranches:  a  first  tranche  of  $12\nmillion  equivalent,  followed  by  two  tranches  of  $9  million\nequivalent  each.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon\ntranches  will  be\nloan  effectiveness.  The \nreleased  at  intervals  of  approximately  18  months.  The\nProgram  contains  a  number  of  tranche  conditions  and\nmilestones  that  must  be  fulfilled  for  tranche  releases  and\nthe successful completion of the Program.\n\nremaining \n\nThe  Ministry  of  General  Administration  will  have  overall\nresponsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the  Program.  The\nEfficiency  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  change\nmanagement  units  in  the  ministries  of  Agriculture  and\nCooperatives,  Education  and  Sports,  and  Health  will  also\nimplement selected program components.\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange\ncost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced in\nand  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries  (other  than\nthose  items  specified  in  Appendix  7  and  imports  financed\nby other bilateral and multilateral sources). Procurement of\neligible  items  will  be  on  the  basis  of  normal  commercial\npractices for procurement by the private sector or standard\nGovernment  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB\nfor procurement by the public sector, except in the case of\n\n\fUtilization\nof the Loan \n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\nv\n\ntraded  on \n\ninternational  commodity\ngoods  commonly \nmarkets,  where  procurement  will  be  undertaken \nin\naccordance  with  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and\nacceptable to ADB.\n\nThe loan will be disbursed within the first three years, until\n30 December 2004. However, program activities will cover\na  four-year  period  prior  to  the  loan  closing  date.  Loan\nproceeds  from  the  first  tranche  can  be  used  to  finance\neligible  expenditures  incurred  up  to  180  days  prior  to  the\ndate of loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan\nproceeds  will  be  used  to  meet  the  financing  requirements\nof  the  Program  as  follows:  (i)  the  $63  million  cost  for\nimplementation  of  the  voluntary  early  retirement  scheme,\n(ii) pay changes that may possibly amount to $37.7 million\nin  the  first  phase  of  the  scheme,  (iii)  staff  induction  and\n(iv)  a  performance\ntraining  costs  of  $2  million, \nimprovement  fund  cost  of  $1.5  million  and,  (v)  other\nmiscellaneous costs.\n\nCofinanced TA in three contract packages for a total of $2\nmillion  will  provide  support \n(i)  core  program\nmanagement  reforms,  (ii)  civil  society  support  for  reform\nmeasures,  and  (iii)  independent  program  monitoring  and\nreporting.\n\nfor \n\nA  basic  assumption  in  the  formulation  of  the  Program  is\nthat the Government and in particular a few central position\nholders  are  prepared  to  undertake  major  changes  in  the\nway the civil service is led, motivated, and evaluated, and\nto reduce corruption. It is also assumed that improvements\nin  these  important  factors  will  underpin  the  likelihood  of\nimproved performance in key areas of implementation and\nservice  delivery.  Political  instability  and  a  lack  of  political\nwill  to  implement  the  reforms  would  certainly  undermine\nthe reform process. This risk is mitigated by (i) using three\ntranches  over  three  years  to  ensure  that  government\ncommitment  is  sustained  and  demonstrated  over  the\nmedium term; (ii) providing performance incentive funds to\nmotivate  participating  ministries  to  implement  the  reforms;\n(iii)  actively  engaging  civil  society  in  the  program  as\nadvocates  of  the  reforms  to  maintain  pressure  on  the\nGovernment to implement the Program, to involve citizens\nin pushing for reforms, and to monitor implementation; (iv)\nstrengthening  anticorruption  agencies  and \ncitizen\nidentifying  corruption  cases;  and  (v)\ninvolvement \n\nin \n\n\fvi\n\ninstitutional\nproviding  cofinanced  TA \ncapacity.  All  political  parties  in  Nepal  have  indicated  that\ngovernance reform is one of their priority commitments.\n\nto  strengthen \n\nThere is a risk that the management skills in areas that are\nnew to government employees may not be quickly learned.\nThe  program  design  takes  account  of  this  factor  by\nproviding training programs, mentoring and implementation\nprogram\nassistance, \nimplementation,  with  independent  program  monitoring  as\nwell.\n\nclose  monitoring \n\nand \n\nof \n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Governance Reform Program (GRP).\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nCivil service reform and elimination of corruption (collectively referred to as governance\nreforms)  are  two  top  priorities  of  the  Government  contained  in  the  comprehensive  Priority\nReform Program discussed with the country\u2019s development partners at the Nepal Development\nForum  held  in  Paris  in  April  2000.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  program  for\n2001  includes  a  program  loan  to  support  the  implementation  of  governance  reforms,  in\nrecognition of their importance to Nepal\u2019s development prospects.\n\n3.\nThe  GRP  was  prepared  as  a  result  of  extensive  stakeholder  consultations  and  policy\ndialogue  with  the  Government.  A  Loan  Reconnaissance  Mission  went  to  Nepal  in  March-April\n2000 and held workshops with key stakeholders to identify the constraints to, and priorities and\nopportunities for governance reform. Further technical assistance (TA) to assist the Government\nin preparing for the reform program was identified as an urgent need. Stakeholder consultations\nwere subsequently held by the Government to develop ownership for the GRP, and to prioritize\nrequired reform actions.\n\n4.\n  Recognizing  the  constraints  facing  the  reform  program,  the  Government  requested\nadvisory  TA1  to  assist  it  in  building  the  leadership  capacity  to  prepare  for  and  implement  the\nreform  program.  Policy  dialogue  on  reforms  was  initiated  while  the  TA  was  being  processed,\nresulting in the Government introducing a number of reform initiatives, including establishment\nof  two  reform  change  units  in  the  Ministry  of  General  Administration  (MOGA)  and  Ministry  of\nFinance  (MOF)  to  manage  the  reform  process.  The  Cabinet  also  approved  formation  of  a\nsecretary-level executive committee to steer the reform process and the GRP. The scope and\nimplementation arrangements of the GRP were firmed up during a Loan Fact-Finding Mission in\nMay-June 2001. Subsequently, a Loan Appraisal Mission further refined the program scope and\npolicy matrix in August 2001.2\n\nI. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans\n\n5.\nIt  is  acknowledged  in  the  Ninth  Plan  document  (1997-2002)  that,  despite  previous\nattempts at administrative reform, Nepalese government administration has remained inefficient,\nwith  a  poor  record  of  service  delivery.  The  objective  of  the  Ninth  Plan  is  to  make  public\njob-oriented,  capable,\nmanagement  clean, \nproductive,  service-oriented,  and  accountable.  The  Plan  document  states  that  public  resource\nmanagement  is  to  become  effective,  and  the  concept  of  good  governance  and  effective\ngovernment is to be promoted. The role of civil society in governance is also to be enhanced.\n\ntransparent,  economical,  competitive, \n\nlean, \n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3622-NEP: Institutional Support for Governance Reforms, for $1,525,000, approved on 18 January 2001.\n2  The Mission consisted of B. Fawcett, Senior Programs Officer/Mission Leader, PW1; C. Vandenabeele, Counsel,\nOGC;  C.  Steffensen,  Senior  Programs  Officer,  PW1;  J.  Jabes,  Governance  Advisor,  SPD;  K.  Julian,  Senior\nPrograms/Implementation Officer, Nepal Resident Mission (NRM); R. Tuladhar, Senior Programs Officer, NRM; A.\nShrestha, Gender Consultant, NRM; and S. Shrestha, Senior Governance and Capacity Building Officer, NRM. R.\nVokes,  Resident Representative, NRM,  provided guidance to the Mission. Staff  from NRM also  provided support\nand assistance to the Mission.\n\n\f2\n\nThe Budget Speech for FY2001 further stressed the need to make government administration\npeople-oriented,  transparent,  and  accountable.  Emphasis  was  put  on  the  need  to  take  action\nagainst  corrupt  practices.  To  make  the  civil  service  productive,  efficient,  and  effective,  the\nBudget  Speech  highlighted  the  need  to  review  positions  and  organizations,  and  to  trim  or\n\u201crightsize\u201d the bureaucracy. The commitment to achieve these objectives was reaffirmed in the\nBudget Speech for FY2002.\n\n6.\nThe  Government,  in  conjunction  with  the  April  2000  Nepal  Development  Forum,\napproved a comprehensive program for reform and poverty reduction with a time-bound action\nplan. The strategic focus was on addressing the problems and weaknesses facing many sectors\nof  the  economy,  and  to  develop  a  sustainable  framework  for  poverty  reduction.  Major  reform\nareas  identified  for  priority  action  included  (i)  consolidation  of  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal\nstructure,  (ii)  private  sector  development,  (iii)  financial  sector  reform,  (iv)  decentralization,  (v)\ngovernance, (vi) aid effectiveness, (vii) civil service reform, and (viii) an enhanced role for civil\nsociety. In the important area of macroeconomic and fiscal reform, the Government has sought\nto (i) prioritize resource allocation at the public and national levels to key areas such as poverty\nreduction,  employment  promotion,  and  support  for  key  sectors;  (ii)  improve  resource\nmobilization;  (iii)  reform  public  expenditure  management;  and  (iv)  improve  the  fiscal  structure,\nparticularly the fiscal deficit.\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  broader  governance  agenda,  which  is  part  of  its  overall  Priority\n7.\nReform Program, is to reorient the role of government and the bureaucracy to one of facilitation,\npolicy formulation, and regulation within a competitive market economy. The Government seeks\nto  strengthen  public  institutions  so  that  they  will  adequately  perform  vital  state  functions  to\npromote  good  governance,  including  fighting  corruption.  The  Government\u2019s  goal  for  reform  of\nNepal\u2019s  civil  service  is  to  develop  a  much  more  results-  and  people-oriented  governance\nenvironment  that  will  contribute  to  accelerated  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  the\nintroduction  of  appropriate  policies  and  mechanisms  related  to  efficiency,  performance,  and\nhuman resource management. Such a civil service will be both efficient and ultimately focused\non  providing  better  public  services  for  its  clients.  This  vision  will  only  be  realized  in  the  long\nterm, over a period of perhaps 10-15 years.\n\nA. \n\nRecent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects\n\n 8.\nNepal\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  5.8  percent  in\nFY2001, compared with 6.4 percent in FY2000. Domestic revenue collection is estimated to be\nlower than budgeted for FY2001, remaining at the previous year\u2019s level of about 11 percent of\nGDP. The budget deficit is expected to have increased to about 5.0 percent of GDP in FY2001,\ncompared  with  about  4.0  percent  in  the  previous  year,  as  a  result  of  increased  spending  on\nsecurity,  a  salary  increase  for  civil  servants,  and  the  implementation  of  a  voluntary  early\nretirement scheme (VERS). Inflation is projected to have increased only slightly in FY2001 from\nits 3.5 percent level in FY2000 as a result of stable food and beverage prices.\n\n9.\nOn the external front, satisfactory export growth and slower import growth has helped to\nnarrow  the  trade  deficit  and  subsequently  the  current  account  deficit,  which  is  expected  to  be\nless than 5 percent of GDP in FY2001, below the average of 8 percent that prevailed during the\n1990s.  During  FY2001,  imports  grew  by  5.5  percent  compared  with  24.5  percent  in  FY2000,\nwhile exports grew by 15.6 percent, compared to 40 percent in FY2000. By the end of FY2001,\nNepal  had  about  $1  billion  in  foreign  exchange  reserves,  enough  to  cover  about  8  months  of\nimports.  External  debt  is  projected  to  be  less  than  47  percent  of  GDP  in  FY2001,  below  the\naverage  level  of  53  percent  that  prevailed  during  the  1990s.  The  debt  service  obligation  is\n\n\f3\n\nestimated to fall to about 4 percent of exports in FY2001 because of concessional lending terms\nto Nepal.\n\n10.\nThe goal of the FY2002 budget is to reduce poverty. The budget was ambitious with a\ntotal  outlay  of  NRe99.8  billion  ($1.3  billion),  representing  an  increase  of  51  percent  over  the\nrevised  estimate  of  NRe60.7  billion  ($876  million)  for  FY2001.  The  fiscal  deficit  in  FY2002  is\nexpected to be about 5 percent of GDP. Development expenditures are projected to grow by 27\npercent,  to  be  financed  mainly  by  foreign  grants.  Domestic  revenue  estimates  are  also\noptimistic, with a projected growth rate of 21 percent, particularly in light of the negative impact\nof the security situation on business activity and tax revenues. The FY2002 budget stresses the\nimportance  of  continuing  the  reform  agenda  initiated  during  FY2001,  which  includes  public\nexpenditure  management  reforms,  financial  sector  reform,  and  private  sector  development.\nGovernance  reform  is  also  highlighted  in  the  budget  statement,  including  the  need  to  address\ncorruption, and to make the civil service responsive, accountable, and transparent.\n\n11. While  the  Government  has  maintained  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment,  Nepal\u2019s\neconomic  success  in  the  medium  term  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  address\nstructural  weaknesses,  particularly  in  the  financial  sector,  governance  and  institutional  issues,\naid  utilization,  and  the  fiscal  deficit.  With  the  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  depending  on\nagriculture for their livelihood, improving the performance of the agriculture sector is also critical.\nSustained  improvement  of  the  trade  deficit  in  the  medium  term  will  require  institutional  and\npolicy  reforms  to  broaden  the  composition  of  exports  and  destinations.  To  reduce  the\ndependence  on  foreign  assistance  for  the  country\u2019s  development  expenditures,  continued\nefforts  are  needed  to  mobilize  domestic  resources  and  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit.  The\nGovernment  must  also  implement  tax  reforms,  financial  sector  reforms,  privatization  of  state-\nowned  enterprises,  and  strengthening  of  the  capital  market.  Ultimately,  if  the  country  is  to\nachieve the levels of sustained growth necessary to lift it out of poverty, the Government needs\nto  continue  to  pursue  its  broad-based  reform  agenda,  with  financial  sector  and  governance\nreforms forming its core.\n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social Development\n\n1. \n\nPoverty\n\n12.\nAbout  42  percent  of  the  population  live  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  NRe4,400\n($77)  per  capita  per  annum,  which  is  based  on  minimum  caloric  intake,  housing,  and  other\nnonfood  standards.  The  Nepal  Poverty  Analysis  recently  completed  with  ADB  assistance3\nshows  that  poverty  incidence,  intensity,  and  severity  have  not  improved  over  the  past  quarter\ncentury, a finding mirrored in the country\u2019s low scores on human development indicators relative\nto  those  of  other  South  Asian  nations.  Further,  inequalities  and  the  scores  on  human\ndevelopment indicators across ecological zones, geographic regions, and the rural-urban divide\nremain  wide,  as  do  those  when  the  levels  for  specific  gender,  ethnic,  and  caste  groups  are\ncompared with counterpart values for the population as a whole.\n\nSpecifically,  the  Poverty  Analysis  confirmed  that  poverty  is  much  more  prevalent,\n13.\nintense,  and  severe  in  rural  areas,  with  the  incidence  of  rural  poverty  almost  double  that  of\nurban  areas  (44  percent  of  the  rural  population  is  poor  compared  with  23  percent  in  urban\nareas),  and  with  90  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  living  in  rural  areas.  Geographically,  the\n\n                  \n\n3    TA  3362-NEP: SSTA for a Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government of\n\nNepal, for $125,000, approved on 22 December 1999.\n\n\f4\n\nincidence of poverty in the Midwestern and Far Western development regions greatly exceeds\nthe national average, as does the rate in the mountain districts.4 Gender-based exclusion in the\ncountry is pervasive and deep, resulting in reduced physical survival of girls and women, fewer\nhealth  and  educational  opportunities,  inequitable  ownership  of  assets,  limited  mobility,  and\noverall low cultural status. All of these findings indicate that, unless these trends are reversed or\nthe current population growth rate of 2.4 percent is lowered, Nepal\u2019s poverty situation is likely to\nworsen over time. The Poverty Analysis identified a number of factors that contribute to poverty\nin  Nepal,  including  (i)  slow  overall  economic  growth  in  the  face  of  relatively  rapid  population\ngrowth; (ii) weak Government redistributive and institutional capacity; (iii) non-agricultural growth\nlacking any significant spillover effects on the rural poor; (iv) low productivity and slow growth of\noutput  in  the  agriculture  sector;  and  (v)  weak  social  and  economic  infrastructure  (health,\neducation, drinking water, transport, energy, and problems relating to land ownership and land\nquality), leading to inadequate access of poor households to the means for escaping poverty. It\nis  also  recognized that poverty in Nepal has been exacerbated by cultural practices that have\ntended  to  exclude  women  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  from  the  full  benefits  of\ndevelopment.  A  meaningful  poverty  reduction  strategy  needs  to  improve  performance  in  all  of\nthese areas, while focusing on directly improving poor households\u2019 access to resources.\n\n14.\nThe  Poverty  Analysis  and  proposed  approach  to  poverty  reduction  in  Nepal  were\ndiscussed  at  the  High  Level  Forum  on  Poverty  Reduction  on  26  February  2001.  The  Forum\nstressed  the  crucial  importance  of  improved  governance  as  the  key  to  Nepal\u2019s  reform  efforts.\nThe  current  Government\u2019s  priorities,  in  addition  to  restoration  of  law  and  order,  are  tackling\ncorruption,  and improved  governance and civil service reform. There is also a need to reduce\nthe pervasive role of the central government and decentralize government responsibilities within\nthe  context  of  a  competitive  market.  The  civil  service  suffers  from  institutional  and  human\nresource weaknesses. Frequent political changes have also disrupted the civil service and led\nto an increasing problem of politicization. The civil service needs to be reformed to enable it to\nbecome service oriented and to play a major role in effectively implementing the Government\u2019s\npoverty reduction strategy in an environment free from political interference. Corruption is also a\nkey  constraint  to  effective  delivery  of  essential  services.  Public  financial  management  and\nresource  mobilization  are  also  weak  and  need  greater  efficiency,  transparency,  and  an\nintegrated  system  to  link  policy  with  planning  to  produce  realistic  budgets  and  development\nexpenditure targets. The Government, with external assistance, is introducing reforms in these\nareas, and ADB plans to continue to assist it in its governance reform program (including civil\nservice reform and anti-corruption efforts).\n\nThe high level forum generally supported the findings of the Poverty Analysis, including\n15.\nthe  severity  of  poverty  in  Nepal,  the  strategy  for  poverty  reduction,  and  constraints  to\nimplementation of the strategy. Based on the results of the Poverty Analysis, the Government\nfinalized its Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy in May 2001. The Strategy will help set priorities\nfor the remainder of the Ninth Plan, will provide an overall framework to coordinate the poverty\nreduction efforts of various funding agencies, and is expected to be the foundation for the Tenth\nPlan.\n\n1. \n\nSocial Development\n\n16.\nNepal  ranked  129th  out  of  162  countries  in  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) 2001 Human Development Report. The people in the poorest regions of\nthe country also have the lowest access to education and basic health services, highest rates of\n\n4  Nepal is divided into three geographic regions: the Terai (flat plains), middle hills, and mountains.\n\n                  \n\n\f5\n\ninfant mortality, and highest rates of child malnutrition. Poverty undermines efforts at promoting\nhuman development, since it prevents many parents from sending their children to school. The\ncurrent literacy rate among individuals age 6 and above is 38 percent (52 percent for males and\n24  percent  for  females).  However,  only  20  percent  of  the  poor  are  literate  compared  with  60\npercent  of  those  in  the  higher  income  groups.  Human  development  has  significant  gender\ndifferences. While 32 percent of poor men are literate, the literacy rate of poor women is much\nlower  at  9  percent.  Illiteracy,  malnutrition,  and  disease  reduce  development  and  employment\nopportunities, worsening poverty. The major challenge facing Nepal remains how to overcome\nthe  low  levels  of  human  development  and  high  population  growth  rate.  The  quality  of  service\ndelivery  needs  to  be  improved  to  increase  the  level  of  human  capital.  This  will  require\ninstitutional  strengthening  and  training  of  service  providers,  including  teachers.  The  need  to\nprioritize  governance  and  social  development  interventions  to  address  these  challenges  is\nrecognized by the Government in its poverty reduction strategy.\n\n17. Women  in  Nepal  are  deprived  and  severely  underprivileged  in  rural  areas.  Nepal  ranks\n120th among 146 countries in UNDP's 1999 gender development index, published in 2001. The\nmaternal mortality rate of 540 per 100,000 live births is one of the highest in the Asia and Pacific\nregion. The gender empowerment measure, which reflects women\u2019s participation in economic,\npolitical,  and  professional  spheres,  was  0.191  in  1996  for  Nepal,  well  below  the  average  of\n0.367 for developing countries in that year.5 Gender disparity persists in educational attainment,\nhealth  status,  and  participation  in  the  decision-making  process.  Disadvantaged  castes  and\nethnic  communities  show  higher  levels  of  gender  disparities  in  all  areas.  Efforts  have  been\nmade by the Government to close the gender gap and to improve the status of women through\nvarious  development  programs  and  activities  funded  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies.\nHowever,  the  results  of  these  efforts  are  likely  to  remain  limited  unless  the  gender  bias  in  the\nsocial system is reduced, if not eliminated. The GRP also needs to address this issue.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nStructure of the Civil Service\n\n18.\nNepal\u2019s  public  sector  consists  of  three  subsectors:  the  central  Government,  local  and\nmunicipal authorities, and state-owned enterprises. The central Government has 21 ministries, 9\nconstitutional  bodies,  and  108  development  boards.  There  are  5  regional  administrations,  75\ndistrict  development  committees,  and  3,914  village  development  committees.  There  are  46\nstate-owned  enterprises.  The  civil  service  in  Nepal  was  originally  established  for  land\nadministration,  collection  of  land  revenue,  maintenance  of  law  and  order,  and  dispensation  of\njustice.  In  1952,  an  administrative  reform  commission  was  constituted  to  streamline  the  civil\nservice, but remained on an ad hoc basis. The civil service was formalized with the passage of\nthe  Civil  Service  Act  of  1957  and  the  Civil  Service  Rules  of  1975.  The  present  civil  service  in\nNepal  is  governed  by  the  1993  Civil  Service  Act  and  Civil  Service  Rules.  In  May  1998,\nParliament again amended the Civil Service Act.\n\n19.\neconomic,  planning,  and  statistical;  education;  engineering; \n\nThe  Nepalese  civil  service  consists  of  ten  services:6  administrative;  agriculture;\njudicial;\n\nforest;  health; \n\n                  \n\n5  The latest UNDP Human Development Report did not rank Nepal.\n6  The health service is governed by the Nepal Health Service Act (1996) while the other nine services are governed\n\nby the latest Civil Service Act promulgated in 1993.\n\n\f6\n\nmiscellaneous; and parliamentary. It does not include the military, police force, teachers, or staff\nof public enterprises and local authorities.7 The total size of Nepal\u2019s civil service is estimated at\n105,000  approved  posts,  of  which  about  90,000  are  currently  occupied.  Approximately  90\npercent of civil servants are in the nongazetted (support staff) class, and of this group, almost\n35 percent are cleaning staff and messengers. There are approximately 0.57 civil servants per\n100  population,  which  is  relatively  small  by  developing  country  standards,  particularly\nconsidering that only 10 percent of the civil servants are at officer level.8 In FY2001, personnel\nexpenditures  comprised  approximately  20  percent  of  the  total  Government  budget,  which\ncompares favorably with other developing countries (an average of 20-25 percent).\n\n20.\nMOGA  is  the  government  ministry  charged  with  the  responsibility  for  administering  the\ncivil service rules and regulations, and is responsible for transfers and promotions within the civil\nservice. MOF is responsible for preparation and administration of the government budget, and is\ntherefore concerned with the level of civil service salaries and the overall wage bill. The Public\nService  Commission  (PSC),  a  constitutional  body,  and  therefore  regarded  as  independent,  is\nresponsible for recruitment to the civil service, and is the guardian of the principle of merit-based\nrecruitment and promotion in the civil service. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of\nAuthority  (CIAA)  is  an  independent  constitutional  body  responsible  for  investigating  and\nrecommending  for  prosecution  cases  of  abuse  of  authority  in  the  public  sector  at  the  national\nlevel. The Special Police are responsible for investigating corruption cases at the district level.\nThe  Auditor-General  Office,  a  constitutional  body,  investigates  irregularities  in  public  sector\nexpenditure, and prepares annual reports on its findings.\n\n21. Women  are  a  highly  underrepresented  group  in  the  civil  service,  accounting  for  only\nabout  8.6  percent  of  total  positions,  5.1  percent  of  officer  level  positions,  and  8.9  percent  of\nsupport staff positions. Affirmative action to redress the gender imbalance in the civil service is\nrequired. At present, there are only three women in the special class, the highest level within the\ncivil  service,  and  25  in  class  one,  of  whom  20  are  in  social  sectors  or  non-administrative\npositions    (accounting  for  only  4  percent  of  the  total  staff  in  these  two  classes).  During  the\nperiod 1997-2000, one woman was promoted to class one, and the trend is similar at all levels,\nindicating that cultural stereotypes prevent the development of an environment that is conducive\nto the promotion of women or to women\u2019s interests.\n\n1. \n\nRecent Performance\n\nfive  administrative  reform  commissions \n\n22.\nNepal  has  a  lengthy  history  of  weak  implementation  of  public  administrative  reform.\nto  1992.  The  1992\nThere  were \nCommissionmade  116  principal  recommendations  aimed  at  making  the  public  service  more\nefficient,  results  oriented,  accountable,  motivated,  and  capable.  Key  proposals  included  the\nimplementation  of  a  15-year  development  plan  and  a  5-year  rolling  plan,  a  reduction  in  the\nnumber  of  ministries  from  21  to  18,  \u201crightsizing\u201d  of  the  bureaucracy,  placement  of  certain\nfunctions (such as the postal service) under autonomous authority, and devolution of power to\nlocal bodies. Originally, it was estimated that three years would be necessary to implement all\nthe  recommendations.  However,  many  of  them  have  yet  to  be  implemented,  although  the\nGovernment has recently introduced a number of measures to streamline the bureaucracy (see\n\nfrom  1952 \n\n                  \n\n7  Personnel in the military total about 50,000; the police force numbers about 60,000; and there are about 127,000\nteachers, approximately 55,000 staff of public enterprises, and 55,000 employees of development boards. These\npersonnel  are  not  included  in  the  number  of  civil  servants,  but  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Government\u2019s\noverall wage bill.\n\n8   India has 1.0 civil servants per 100 people; Pakistan, 1.5; and Sri Lanka, 4.5.\n\n\f7\n\nparas. 24-26). The main reason for the inability to implement the reforms was the short tenure of\nseven coalition governments from 1994 to 1999, prior to a majority government being elected.\n\n23.\nPrior  to  September  1998,  many  laws  including  some  form  of  decentralization  were\nproposed,  and  elections  were  held  for  local  bodies  at  the  village  and  district  levels.  However,\nlittle was achieved in terms of extending actual local autonomy, and decision-making remained\ncentralized. In September 1998, Parliament passed the Local Self-Governance Act. The extent\nof the resulting decentralization will depend on the central Government\u2019s willingness to delegate\nauthority  to  a  lower  administrative  and  political  level.  The  Government  announced  in  the\nFY2002 Budget Speech that in FY2002 it plans to devolve responsibility for primary education,\nagricultural  extension,  and  health  service  delivery  to  the  village  level,  putting  these  services\nunder  the  management  of  local  committees.  In  addition,  considerable  effort  is  needed  to\nstrengthen the capacity for policy, program, and project formulation and implementation at both\nthe central and local levels.\n\n24.\nMore  recently,  even  prior  to  the  implementation  of  TA  3622  in  May  2001,  the\nGovernment  showed  its  commitment  to  the  reform  program  by  taking  a  number  of  actions.\nSeveral  meetings  of  the  high-level  Administrative  Reforms  Coordination  and  Monitoring\nCommittee  (ARCMC,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister)  and  the  secretary-level  executive\ncommittee  on  the  reforms  (chaired  by  the  minister,  MOGA)  have  been  held  since  November\n1999  to  take  decisions  and  guide  the  reform  process.  As  an  outcome  of  these  meetings  the\nnumber of ministries was reduced from 26 to 21 in mid-2000. Freezing of 5,000 vacant positions\nand abolition of 1,045 other positions was accomplished in FY2001, with savings of $2.4 million.\nIn  addition,  over  900  staff  from  the  reserve  pool  were  transferred  to  other  offices.  Permanent\nstaff  are now  being  used  in development projects instead of contract staff, and the number of\ntemporary positions has been reduced.\n\n25.\nIn FY2001, a VERS was offered to civil servants. The scheme was limited to lower level\nnongazetted staff, and over 2,600 applied, of whom more than 98 percent were approved. The\npositions  of  those  retired  will  be  eliminated.  The  Government  improved  and  decompressed\nwage scales, with salary increases from peon (office helper) to secretary (head civil servant in a\nministry) level of 50-88 percent, respectively. The compression ratio for wages increased from\n3.1 to 3.6 for salaries and from 2.9 to 3.3 for take-home pay. The Government also approved a\npolicy  of  not  creating  new  development  boards,  which  has  often  been  used  as  a  way  of\nincreasing  staff  numbers  outside  the  civil  service.  Payroll  consolidation  and  strengthening  is\nalso being introduced. A review of the Civil Service Act amendments has also been undertaken\nwith  the  objective  of  streamlining  and  refining  the  Act.  The  effectiveness  of  the  CIAA  was\nstrengthened  by  the  appointment  of  a  new  chief  commissioner  and  senior  staff  in  December\n2000,  and  it  has  started  to  show  a  degree  of  effectiveness  and  commitment  by  filing,  in  mid-\n2001,  a  high-profile  case  (among  several  others)  against  10  senior  individuals,  including  a\nformer minister. The Government has also presented three anticorruption bills or amendments\nto  Parliament  to  strengthen  the  anticorruption  legislative  framework.  The  Prevention  of\nCorruption Bill consolidates existing legislation; an amendment to the CIAA Act will strengthen\nCIAA\u2019s powers, including establishment of a specialized anticorruption court; and legislation on\nspecialized  courts  will  allow  the  creation  of  this  special  anticorruption  court.  A  Freedom  of\nInformation  Bill  has  been  drafted  to  compel  public  representatives  to  declare  assets;  and  a\nPolitical Parties Bill has been drafted requiring an annual financial audit of all political parties. In\nsummary,  the  Government  has  shown  its  commitment  to  governance  reform  through  these\nactions.\n\n\f8\n\nA  number  of  other  significant  reform  actions  have  also  been  recently  taken  by  the\n26.\nGovernment. MOGA established the Governance Reform Coordination Unit (GRCU) to form the\nnucleus  of  the  governance  reform  implementation  group,  with  the  Government\u2019s  strong\ncommitment  to  improving  overall  performance  being  reflected  with  the  strengthening  of  senior\nstaff  in  MOGA  to  lead  the  reform  program.  The  Prime  Minister  until  recently  also  retained  the\nMOGA portfolio because of the importance that is attached to the reform program. Change units\nled  by  senior  staff  have  been  formed  in  three  key  ministries\u2014Agriculture  and  Cooperatives\n(MOAC), Education and Sports (MOES), and Health (MOH)\u2014to implement the reform program.\nRegarding  improvement  in  the  overall  efficiency  of  the  civil  service,  in  addition  to  the  VERS,\npersonnel  expenditures  are  being  reduced,  and  the  Public  Expenditure  Reforms  Commission\nhas submitted a comprehensive report that the Government is committed to implement.\n\nIn addition to many workshops held from June 1999 to April 2000, a series of workshops\n27.\nwith  key  stakeholders,  including  senior  bureaucrats,  politicians,  civil  society,  and  funding\nagencies,  was  held  in  mid-2000  to  assist  in  raising  the  level  of  stakeholder  ownership  and\ncommitment  to  the  governance  reform  process,  and  to  discuss  the  scope  of  the  program  and\nrefine the policy matrix. Based on the workshops, in November 2000 the Government approved\na  discussion  paper  that  outlined  the  scope  of  the  GRP  and  the  draft  policy  matrix  for  the\nproposed program loan.\n\nThe Government has continued the consultation process with key stakeholders through\n28.\na number of workshops since mid-2000. These have included senior bureaucrats, civil servants,\ncivil  service  unions,  politicians,  civil  society,  and  aid  agencies.  The  focus  of  discussions  was\nreform  priorities  and  addressing  specific  concerns  about  particular  components  of  the  reform\nprogram, including the need to increase the representation of females in the civil service. The\noverall  objective  of  the  consultations  was  to  obtain  further  support  for  the  reform  process,\nparticularly  from  politicians.  This  appears  to  have  been  achieved,  since  all  political  parties,\nincluding  the  opposition  party,  have  publicly  indicated  their  strong  commitment  to  governance\nreform.  The  consultations  will  continue  as  part  of  the  GRP  implementation  process.  Periodic\nmeetings with the all-party State Affairs Committee of Parliament to report on the status of GRP\nimplementation have been held and will continue to be held. Support for the reform process is\nalso  present  at  the  level  of  senior  civil  servants,  and  among  several  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) actively involved in advocating governance reform.\n\n3.\n\nPrevious Assistance\n\nPreparation  of  an  action  plan  on  civil  service  reforms  under  TA  31179  began  in  June\n29.\n1999  and  was  completed  in  December  2000.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  TA  was\nMOGA. The TA was designed to lay the groundwork for broader reform efforts and to probe the\nseriousness  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  such  a  course  of  action.  It  used  previous\nstudies,  especially  the  1992  Administrative  Reform  Commission  report  prepared  by  the\nGovernment.\n\n30.\nThe  initiatives  under  the  TA  included  (i)  conducting  a  civil  service  census;  (ii)  the\nestablishment  of  a  computerized  personnel  database;  (iii)  undertaking  a  functional  review  of\nministries,  departments,  and  offices  to  identify  areas  for  streamlining,  consolidation,  or\ndevolution; and (iv) considering a range of alternatives for fiscal decentralization.\n\n9 TA 3117-NEP: Formulating an Action Plan on Civil Service Reforms, for $630,000, approved on 14 December 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\nThe  functional  review  of  ministries  was  completed  as  planned.  Utilizing  ministry\n31.\nmanagement and staff teams working with the consultants, each ministry identified opportunities\nfor  change, \nincluding  reorganization  of  priorities,  performance  reward  systems,  and\nperformance budgeting needs, which will be implemented during the GRP.\n\n32.\nThe  Government  is  using  the  civil  service  census  data  prepared  under  the  TA  to\ncross-check  its  manual  records,  which  are  being  computerized.  The  Government  is  in  the\nprocess of linking the personnel database to its payroll. MOF issued an instruction that MOGA\nshould be provided with a record of all sanctioned and vacant positions and a list of names of\nstaff  in  the  positions,  and  that  salaries  would  not  be  paid  to  staff  of  offices  that  had  not\nsubmitted the lists of sanctioned position holders in the civil service. All ministries complied with\nthe instruction with the exception of MOH, whose staff are in a different service from other civil\nservants. This action will effectively link personnel records with the payroll. The computerization\nof personnel records is targeted for completion by early 2002.\n\n33.\nThe consultant team for TA 3622 was fielded on 14 May 2001. The TA is assisting the\nGovernment to move from the definition of its reform program, with which the previous TA 3117\nassisted, to continuing to introduce the first steps in its long-term reform program. The pressing\nneeds at the moment are (i) to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to implement the reforms;\nand (ii) to assist it in preparing policies and legislation, and in undertaking further reform actions.\nThe  TA  is  strengthening  GRCU  within  MOGA,  and  the  Efficiency  Unit  within  MOF  that  the\nGovernment has established to lead the reform process.\n\n34.\nTA  3622  is  assisting  the  Government  in  further  assessing  options  and  priorities  to\nimplement the reform program in the most efficient, cost-effective manner to achieve the desired\nobjectives. It is also contributing to broadening of the support base, and formation of a coalition\nin civil society to press for the reforms through stakeholder consultation and participation. The\nTA is supporting the Government in preparing for implementation of the program loan and has\nassisted the Government in meeting the proposed program loan\u2019s first tranche conditions. The\nTA will continue to support actions to meet the loan\u2019s second tranche conditions until October\n2002.\n\nA. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n35.\n Prior to 1999, a number of attempts were made to reform Nepal\u2019s civil service, but these\nwere largely unsuccessful (para. 22), which can be attributed to four main factors: (i) absence of\nserious political commitment; (ii) resistance from civil servants, (iii) lack of serious dialogue on\nreform opportunities with stakeholders outside the civil service, and (iv) lack of experience and\nappropriate skills to diagnose the real central issues, and develop a process for managing and\nimplementing the needed changes.\n\n36.\nPast  lessons  are  clear.  First,  broad-based  political  commitment  needs  to  be  fostered  if\npoliticians, especially legislators, are engaged in the process of deciding on reform priorities and\nsolutions.  Second,  resistance  among  bureaucrats  and  civil  service  trade  unions  must  be\novercome.  Third,  the  Government  needs  to  consult  more  widely  with  external  stakeholders\nwithin  Nepal\u2014in  particular,  civil  society,  politicians,  the  private  sector,  and  academics\u2014to\ngenerate a wider range of options and support for reform. While consultations took place with\nexternal  stakeholders  during  the  process  of  developing  the  reform  strategy,  it  is  essential  that\ncontinued  participation  of  such  groups  is  ensured  in  the  process,  to  maintain  the  pressure  for\nreform on the Government.\n\n\f10\n\nPerhaps the most important lesson, and hence the issue that has to be faced head on,\n37.\nand  which  is  borne  out  by  both  international  experience  and  the  specifics  of  past  efforts  in\nNepal,  is  that  a  change  management  process,  such  as  the  one  now  contemplated  for  the\nNepalese civil service, must (i) be anchored around a reform agenda developed and owned by\nNepalese;  (ii)  address  central  and  cross-cutting  issues  at  the  heart  of  poor  management\nprocesses  and  suboptimal  performance;  (iii)  improve  the  basic  and  specific  skills  needed  for\nnew  processes  and  new  ways  of  doing  business;  (iv)  be  implemented  by  the  civil  servants\nthemselves, towards agreed upon and stated ends that positively impact the general populace;\nand  (v)  be  supported  and  demanded  from  both  inside  the  bureaucracy  and  the  population  at\nlarge.  The  current  government\u2019s  commitment  to  reform,  senior  bureaucrats\u2019  realization  of\ninefficiencies,  and  their  willingness  to  seek  systemic  changes  and  to  open  a  dialogue  with\nstakeholders  are  positive  signs  that  provide  an  impetus  for  change.  The  provision  of  TA  to\ndevelop capacity to manage and implement change will reinforce this situation.\n\n  The  principal  constraints  to  operation  of  an  efficient,  service-oriented  civil  service  are\n\n38.\nsummarized in paras. 39-44.\n\n1.  Fiscal Problems\n\n39.\nThe Government must take decisive action to improve its internal efficiency before it can\nstart  to  build  a  civil  service  that  is  capable  of  delivering  better  services.  While  wage  bill\npressures have in the past been relatively weak, the FY2001 pay increases that ranged from 50\nto 88 percent have put further pressure on the substantially underfunded operating budgets for\nkey government services. In addition, the new civil service pay levels were introduced without\nfirst shifting resources towards nonwage operational expenditures, and achieving fiscal savings\nin a situation in which no significant growth in government revenues can be anticipated in the\nshort term.\n\nAlso,  the  public  service  wage  bill  lacks  transparency,  since  personnel  expenditures\n40.\nappear both in the development and regular budget, and the number of civil servants engaged\nis  not  closely  related  to  the  number  of  approved  establishment  posts.  Civil  servants  are\nengaged  on  the  development  budget  on  temporary  terms  for  so-called  \u201cproject\u201d  posts,  even\nthough in many instances these are regular line positions.10 Similarly, teachers (who are not in\nthe civil service) are hired, often on temporary terms, based upon pupil enrollment figures that\nare widely recognized as inflated. It requires a commitment at both the political and bureaucratic\nlevels to make any significant progress in controlling the public service wage bill, including the\nteacher wage bill.\n\n41.\nThe  purposes  of  instituting  stronger  wage  bill  and  establishment  controls  are  to  (i)\nreduce  substantially  the  number  of  temporary  civil  servants,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  all  new  staff\nrecruited  fill  a  vacant  post  that  has  been  properly  authorized.  The  development  of  a\ncomputer-based personnel information system that can be linked to established posts and the\ncivil service payroll is central to the second purpose.\n\n1.  Corruption\n\n42.\nCorruption  is  a  systemic  problem  that  undermines  the  performance  of  the  bureaucracy\nand the Government as a whole. The current Prime Minister has announced his determination\n\n                  \n\n10  The  Government  has  recently  reduced  over  1,100  existing  positions,  shifted  redundant  staff,  and  reduced  the\n\nnumber of temporary posts, but these reforms need to be broader to achieve significant efficiencies.\n\n\f11\n\nto  tackle  the  problem  of  institutionalized  corruption.  Corruption  is  manifested  in  a  variety  of\ntransactions. These practices are fed by, if not caused by, the relatively low pay levels of civil\nservants. While the recent pay increases may have some mitigating impact on the incidence of\ncorruption,  more  direct  interventions  to  reduce  corruption  are  essential  in  the  short  term.  The\npresent  enforcement  mechanisms  are  weak,  and  the  legislative  framework  for  preventing  and\ncontrolling  corruption  in  the  past  was  inadequate,  but  recently  proposed  legislation  will\nstrengthen  the  framework.  Both  are  priority  areas  that  must  continue  to  be  addressed.  Civil\nsociety  needs  to  be  fully  involved  in  discussing  the  anticorruption  program,  and  a  coalition  of\nstakeholders  needs  to  be  built,  both  within  and  outside  government,  to  push  for  reform  in  this\narea,  and  for  governance  reform  generally.  New  draft  bills  to  control  corruption  and  establish\nspecial  courts  to  hear  corruption  cases,  combined  with  strong  leadership  and  qualified\npersonnel at the CIAA are encouraging signs.\n\n1.  Low Staff Productivity and Morale\n\n43.\nDuring the past decade there has been a marked deterioration in the productivity of the\ncivil service, and staff morale is very low. The causes of this situation are complex, including (i)\npolitical  interference  in  appointments  and  placements;  (ii)  noncompliance  with  the  principle  of\nmeritocracy  in  promotion;  (iii)  opportunities  for  corruption  that  divert  attention  from  official  job\nfunctions; (iv) restricted training opportunities combined with training that is not job-related; (v) a\nfailure to attract the best qualified persons, partly due to low pay; (vi) salary levels that do not\nmeet  basic  living  requirements;  and  (vii)  ineffective  staff  appraisal  systems.  To  the  extent  that\nthe GRP is equitably applied and good performers are rewarded, it will go a long way towards\nreducing such motivational problems.\n\n1.  Performance and Service Issues\n\n44.\nAlthough  in  recent  years  some  sector  ministries  have  made  efforts  to  provide  better\nservices,  these  efforts  have  tended  to  be  piecemeal.  Bureaucrats  tend  to  give  first  priority  to\nprocedures and paperwork, rather than being open and accessible to the public they serve, and\noriented  to  providing  needed  services.  Most  of  the  work  undertaken  by  senior  civil  servants\nremains  nontransparent  and  is  rarely  communicated  to  the  public.  It  is  imperative  that  the\nGovernment  improve  the  performance  of  its  ministries,  but  this  must  be  achieved  in  the  most\neffective  and  appropriate  manner  and  must  take  account  of  certain  difficulties  currently  faced,\nsuch as the gender imbalance. The Government in the FY2001and FY2002 Budget Speeches\nstated unequivocally that Nepal needs a civil service that is both results- and people-oriented. A\ncoherent approach to improving the performance of Nepal\u2019s civil service is now required that will\ninclude giving the public a voice in determining the services that are desired and how they will\nbe  delivered.  This  approach  must  involve  (i)  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  to  refine  and\nparticipate  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  new  approach;  (ii)  new  management\npractices and techniques, such as results-oriented management, performance contracting, and\nperformance budgeting (as have been successfully applied elsewhere in Asia); and (iii) specific\ntraining that is oriented to the development of skills needed for the new ways of doing business.\nHowever, the specific methodologies, techniques, and internal processes to be used will need to\nbe  carefully  tailored  to  Nepal\u2019s  circumstances  and  management  culture,  and  developed  and\nowned by senior civil servants, managers, and staff, if needed reform changes are to take hold\nover  the  longer  term.  Such  changes  require  the  continuous  commitment  of  successive\ngovernments  and  senior  bureaucrats  and  necessitate  an  environment  where  provision  of\nappropriate performance and service levels is reinforced over time.\n\n\fA. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n12\n\n45.\nThe vision for Nepal\u2019s governance reforms is to create a civil service that is both results-\nand  people-oriented,  and  gender  responsive.  Such  a  civil  service  will  be  both  efficient  and\nultimately focused on providing better public services for its clients. The reforms will contribute\nto  a  redefinition  of  the  role  of  government,  focusing  on  facilitation  and  regulation  within  a\ncompetitive market economy. This vision will be realized only in the long term, over a period of\nperhaps 10-15 years, and will require sustained external support throughout that period.\n\n1. \n\nFirst Phase of Reform (2001-2005)\n\n46.\nThe objectives of the first four-year phase of the reform program, which is already being\nimplemented,  are  to  introduce  interrelated  interventions  that  will  catalyze  and  begin  to  effect\nfundamental changes in the civil service and governance environment. It will focus on the critical\ninstitutional constraints that cut across the whole of the civil service\u2014such as issues of pay and\nhuman resource development\u2014and it will specifically pilot techniques and approaches for doing\nbusiness in a whole new way with the ultimate objective of improved service delivery in five key\nministries  (MOGA,  MOF,  MOAC,  MOES,  and  MOH).  These  interventions  will  need  to  be\nsupported  by  complementary  actions  to  strengthen  the  budget  process  and  to  mobilize\nrevenues more effectively. In subsequent reform phases, improved performance will be adopted\non a wider scale throughout the civil service.\n\n47.\nTo  ensure  that  the  reform  initiatives  are  implemented  effectively  and  in  a  sequenced\nmanner, effective mechanisms and structures for leading, supporting, and managing reform at a\nnumber of levels of government are a necessary first step in the reform process. Since political\ncommitment  is  indispensable  to  reform,  leadership  must  be  centered  on  the  Cabinet-  and\nsecretary-level governance reform committees that have already been established (see para. 74\nfor  the  composition  of  the  committees).  Developing  an  internal  capability  for  leading  reform  is\nviewed as an integral part of this reform process. This will involve strengthening of GRCU within\nMOGA,  the  Efficiency  Unit  in  MOF,  and  the  change  management  units  in  the  three  pilot  line\nministries, MOAC, MOES, and MOH.\n\nThe  second  step  of  the  governance  reforms  will  focus  on  freeing  up  resources  to\n48.\nenhance  pay  and  to  increase  the  proportion  of  operating  expenditures  in  the  regular  budget.\nAppropriate  measures  would  include  stronger  wage  bill  controls,  reductions  in  establishment\nposts and staff, transfer and devolution of functions to the private sector and local authorities,\nimproved record management, and revised pay policies. The primary focus for implementation\nof this set of actions will be MOGA and MOF.\n\n49.\nA  third  necessary  step  to  professionalize  and  motivate  the  civil  service  will  include\nactions  to  develop  leadership  and  management  qualities  of  senior  civil  servants,  to  recruit\ntalented  staff,  to  enhance  pay  levels,  and  to  redress  the  gender  imbalance  in  the  service.\nCoupled  with  appropriate  tools  and  materials  provided  through  a  larger  operating  budget,  civil\nservants should be better equipped to perform well. The focal point will be MOGA as the agency\nleading the reform process.\n\n50.\nThe  fourth  step  will  be  to  inject  into  pilot  ministries  a  robust  but  simple  performance\nimprovement  process  to  assist  them  to  provide  better  services,  again  led  by  MOGA.  The\nestablishment  of  effective  processes  for  improving  the  performance  of  the  civil  service  will  be\nimplemented through two central ministries (MOGA and MOF) and introduced first in three key\nservice delivery ministries\u2014MOAC, MOES, and MOH\u2014which are most visible and important to\n\n\f13\n\nall  Nepalese  citizens  because  the  services  being  provided  are  basic  to  their  survival  and  to\npoverty  reduction.  In  addition,  these  are  the  three  ministries  chosen  in  the  FY2002  Budget\nSpeech as targets for devolution of functions to local authorities, a process that the GRP would\nsupport.  The  emphasis  in  introducing  performance  improvement  will  be  on  continuous\ntargets.  Tailored\nimprovement  rather \ninterventions  to  enhance  staff  skills  and  improve  business  processes  will  be  built  into  the\nperformance  plans  and  will  help  underpin  the  delivery  of  improved  and  specified  service\nstandards.  These  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  improvements  in  budget  planning  and\nimplementation.  Performance  incentive  funds  will  be  established  to  reward  ministries  that\nsuccessfully improve performance, based on agreed upon criteria.\n\nthe  achievement  of  arbitrary  performance \n\nthan \n\n51.\nLinked to the fourth step concerned with performance improvement, a fifth crosscutting\nstep is the need to reduce corruption, for which the focal point will be CIAA and other concerned\nagencies  engaged  in  anticorruption  actions.  Anticorruption  activities  will  focus  on  passage  of\nlegislation to strengthen efforts to prevent corruption; on enforcement of anticorruption laws; and\non  institution  building  in  key  anticorruption  agencies,  particularly  CIAA.  Existing  provisions  for\nasset  and  income  declarations  by  elected  public  representatives  and  civil  servants  will  be\nenforced, and new provisions introduced as required. A public awareness program to inform the\npublic of the role of anticorruption agencies and how to report corruption will be introduced. A\nschematic figure outlining the key steps and the objectives of the reform process is contained in\nAppendix 1.\n\n2.\n\nSubsequent Phases of Reform\n\nThe  actual  details  of  how  the  vision  for  achieving  the  goal  of  the  GRP  will  evolve  will\n52.\nemerge  through  a  process  approach.  However,  in  this  subsection  the  manner  in  which  the\nreforms might be implemented is described. If the first phase of reform succeeds in beginning\nthe  process  of  creating  a  more  efficient,  capable,  and  motivated  civil  service,  subsequent\nphases  would  concentrate  on  introducing  to  other  ministries  the  new  approaches  to  improved\nperformance first tested in MOGA, MOF, and the three pilot service delivery ministries (MOAC,\nMOES, and MOH). Over time the senior management teams in all ministries and departments\nwould be able to execute these processes without the need for support from GRCU in MOGA.\nThe  role  of  GRCU  would  change  to  one  of  establishing  the  basic  principles  for  managing\nperformance  and  their  subsequent  monitoring  to  ensure  consistent  application  throughout  the\ncivil service. The earlier focus of performance improvement on departments and divisions would\ncascade  down  to  work  teams  and  individuals;  perhaps  involving  group  or  individual\nperformance-related pay.\n\n53.\nIn future phases of the GRP, it is envisaged that government\u2019s service delivery functions\nwould  increasingly  be  delegated  to  corporate  agencies  operating  at  arms  length  from  their\nparent ministries, the private sector, or local authorities, leaving central Government with largely\npolicy-making  and  regulatory  functions,  consistent  with  the  envisioned  government  role  in  the\nGRP. The long-term objective would be that such service providers would be more flexible, and\nable to respond quickly to the demands of their clients. They would adapt modern management\nmethods  to  local  cultural  values,  possibly  including  performance  budgeting  techniques.  Local\nauthorities  assuming  responsibility  for  devolved  service  delivery  would  require  considerable\nlong-term  capacity  building  to  assume  these  functions  under  a  decentralized  government\nstructure.\n\n\fA. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n14\n\n54.\nExternal assistance in the governance sector has been broad and generally focused on\ncivil  service  reform,  strengthening  local  governance  and  decentralization,  public  expenditure\nmanagement,  and  financial  sector  reform  including  privatization.  Almost  all  of  this  assistance\nhas  been  grant  financed  except  the  ADB  and  World  Bank  assistance  in  the  financial  sector,\nwhich  are  loan  financed.  Most  of  the  assistance  by  other  agencies  is  focused  on  local\ngovernance and decentralization, generally aiming to strengthen the capacity of local governing\nbodies  and  community-based  organizations  to  plan,  implement,  monitor,  and  coordinate\ndevelopment work in which local initiatives are integrated.\n\n55.\nAssistance  of  the  World  Bank  and  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  in  the  financial\nsector  is  focused  on  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  sector  in  general,  and\nmanagement  and  performance  of  key  financial  institutions  in  particular.  IMF  is  preparing  for\npossible  approval  in  2002  of  a  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  that  will  emphasize\nimproved banking supervision and commercial bank reforms. The structural policy matrix for the\nFacility contains a number of reform conditions based on conditions for the proposed GRP loan.\n\n56.\nThe  World  Bank  supported  the  work  of  the  Administrative  Reform  Commission  in  the\nearly  1990s  that  made  a  number  of  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  and\nefficiency  of  the  civil  service.  It  also  conducted  a  series  of  comprehensive  studies  on  Public\nExpenditure Management in the mid-1990s and more recently supported the Government\u2019s own\nPublic  Expenditure  Review  and  reform  initiatives  to  rationalize  and  streamline  public\nexpenditure.  The  World  Bank  is  preparing  a  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  for  possible\napproval in 2001, which also focuses on implementation of the recommendations of the Public\nExpenditure  Review  Commission,  and  therefore  has  conditions  supportive  of  civil  service\nreform.  The  World  Bank  is  preparing  a  Country  Procurement  Assessment  Report  that  will\ncontain an action plan to make procurement more transparent and efficient. ADB, through the\njoint Country Portfolio Review Mission with the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International\nCooperation,  is  supporting  this  initiative,  which  will  lead  to  annual  procurement  plans  for  all\nprojects  and  to  preparation  of  public  procurement  legislation  to  improve  governance  in\ngovernment procurement.\n\n57.\nSince  the  mid-1990s  UNDP  has  been  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization\nefforts  though  the  Participatory  District  Development  Program  and  the  Local  Governance\nProgram,  covering  a  total  of  60  of  the  75  districts.  Since  1998,  Danish  International\nDevelopment  Assistance  (DANIDA)  has  been  supporting  a  wide  range  of  good  governance\ninitiatives  under  its  Human  Rights,  Good  Governance  and  Decentralization  Program.  DANIDA\nhas  also  been  providing,  since  1999,  support  for  the  decentralization  process.  The  recently\nlaunched  United  Kingdom  Department \nInternational  Development  (DFID)-supported\nEnabling  State  Program  seeks  to  promote  pro-poor  governance  by  addressing  the  twin\nproblems  of  practical  understanding  of  governance  problems  and  the  creation  of  a  desire  for\nchange  among  key  power  holders.  Additionally,  DFID  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s\nprivatization  program  aimed  at  privatizing  selected  public  enterprises;  and  capacity  building  of\nNGOs  and  community-based  organizations  in  selected  districts  through  its  Participatory\nLearning  and  Advisory  Project.  Since  1998,  the  Netherlands  Development  Organization  has\nbeen providing assistance for strengthening the capacity of local governments and community-\nbased  organizations  for  transparent  bottom-up  planning  and  coordinating  development  efforts.\nThe  Swiss  Agency  for  International  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  is  supporting  a\nnumber  of  governance-related  interventions  including  strengthening  of  local  government\ncapacity, making public decision-making more transparent by promoting adoption of an integrity\n\nfor \n\n\f15\n\ncode  and  civil  society  coalitions  to  advocate  transparency,  and  building  the  capacity  of\ncommunity-based  organizations  and  citizens  to  advocate  governance  reform.  These  activities\nare  closely  related  to  proposed  GRP  activities,  and  close  coordination  with  SDC  has  been\nmaintained and will be continued.\n\nA. \n\nADB Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nADB Operations\n\n58.\nBased on the priorities enunciated in the 1999 Nepal Country Operational Strategy, the\nrecent  Poverty  Analysis,  the  Government\u2019s  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  and  the  High\nLevel  Poverty  Reduction  Forum  held  in  Kathmandu  on  26  February  2001,  the  overarching\nobjective of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update is to achieve a sustainable reduction\nin  poverty  through  (i)  generation  of  productive  employment  opportunities  and  increased  rural\nincomes  resulting  from  faster  and  broad-based  propoor  economic  growth,  (ii)  equitable\nimprovements  in  basic  social  services  to  enhance  human  development,  and  (iii)  good\ngovernance.\n\n59.\nPriorities  that  emerged  from  the  Poverty  Analysis  and  High  Level  Poverty  Forum\nincluded  (i)  the  need  to  achieve  broad-based  growth  through  employment  promotion  and\nimproved productivity, with emphasis on the agriculture sector; (ii) the need for macroeconomic\npolicies and reforms to support poverty reduction programs; (iii) social sector development; (iv)\ntargeted  programs  for  excluded  groups,  particularly  women;  (v)  improved  public  expenditure\nmanagement; (vi) improved governance; and (vii) improved poverty assessment and monitoring.\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program seeks to focus on some of the key priorities identified.\n\nADB  has \n\n60.\nto  allocate  Asian\nintroduced  a  performance-based  allocation  system \nDevelopment  Fund  resources  to  eligible  developing  member  countries.  The  system  measures\ncountry  performance  in  19  areas,  including  governance  and  public  sector  management.  The\nsystem  also  assesses  performance  related  to  country-specific  criteria.  For  Nepal,  specific\ncriteria have been included to assess progress on governance reform. The World Bank\u2019s Nepal\nCountry Assistance Strategy also ties future lending levels, among other indicators, to progress\non governance reform. Governance is a key element of DFID\u2019s Country Strategy Paper. Several\nother  aid  agencies  include  good  governance  as  a  critical  issue  in  their  current  country\nstrategies. Working with other development partners, ADB will support the Government\u2019s efforts\nto implement institutional development strategies and the GRP endorsed in the Ninth Plan, and\nthe discussion paper on the GRP approved by the Government in 2000.\n\n61.\nApart  from  the  ongoing  commitment  to  assist  the  Government  with  civil  service  reform\nand governance programs, ADB has previously assisted the Government of Nepal with program\nloans in the agriculture sector, including loans for crop intensification, agriculture, and forestry.\nADB\u2019s recent Agriculture Program Loan11 sought to address policy and institutional impediments\nto  realizing  the  planned  increase  in  agricultural  productivity  under  the  Agricultural  Perspective\nPlan.  The  program  included  liberalization  of  fertilizer  trade  and  reduction  in  distortions  in\nirrigation,  food  grain  marketing,  and  rural  finance.  The  Industrial  Sector  Program  Loan12  was\nalso  provided  to  create  a  policy  environment  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  industry  sector.\nThe program supported increased reliance on market forces and increased participation of the\nprivate  sector  in  the  industrial  development  of  the  country.  In  sectors  such  as  finance,\n\n                  \n\n11 Loan 1604-NEP: Second Agriculture Program, for $50 million, approved on 22 January 1998.\n12 Loan 1229-NEP: Industrial Sector Program, for $20.6 million, approved on 27 April 1993.\n\n\f16\n\neducation,  transport,  environment,  water  supply,  and  energy,  ADB  assistance  and  policy\ndialogue  have  sought  to  introduce  sector  reforms  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  government\nservice delivery; legal, institutional and regulatory environments; and private sector participation,\nincluding beneficiaries, in the sectors.\n\n2.\n\nADB Experiences and Lessons Learned\n\n62.\nADB\u2019s experience with program lending in its member countries has had mixed results.\nOf the 37 program loans with completed program performance audit reports (PPARs), 10 have\nbeen rated as generally successful, 25 as partly successful, 1 as unsuccessful, and 1 was not\nrated. For public sector loans to Nepal, the results have also been mixed. Of the 37 loans with\nPPARs, 19 were rated as generally successful, 10 as partly successful, and 8 as unsuccessful.\nOf the 37 loans to Nepal with PPARs, 4 were program loans. One was rated as successful, and\nthree  were  rated  partly  successful.  The  Crop  Intensification  Program  loan13  was  considered\nsuccessful because increases in productivity and incomes in the program area were achieved.\nA partly successful rating was given to the Second Crop Intensification Program loan14 because\npolicy  reform  and  institutional  development  objectives  were  not  achieved  during  the  period  of\nthe program. A partly successful assessment was given to the Agriculture Program15  because\nthe design lacked a detailed analysis of the fertilizer subsector. The Forestry Sector Program16\nwas  rated  partly  successful  because  there  was  ineffective  implementation  of  the  policy  reform\nand  investment  components.  The  most  recent  program  loan  in  Nepal  was  the  Second\nAgriculture Program. Performance on this loan was relatively satisfactory, with the Government\nhaving taken a number of difficult policy decisions regarding elimination of agricultural subsidies,\nand having fulfilled by June 2000 the conditions for release of the second tranche.\n\n63.\nADB  has  implemented  several  public  sector  reform  programs,  primarily  in  Pacific\ndeveloping  member  countries.  The  major  lessons  learned  from  these  programs,  and  from  a\nlarge  number  of  reform  programs  funded  by  other  agencies,  including  the  World  Bank,  are\nsummarized  here.  Perhaps  the  most  important  factor  contributing  to  a  successful  reform\nprogram  is  political  commitment  and  ownership.  Successful  reform  programs  must  be\ndeveloped  by  and  owned  by  governments  rather  than  being  externally  driven.  Political\ncommitment  is  required  both  from  government  itself,  at  the  cabinet  level,  and  from  opposition\nparties,  to  ensure  that  there  is  broad  support  for  reform  programs.  This  is  required  because\nreform  programs  introduce  major  changes  in  the  way  the  Government  operates,  and  directly\naffect the careers and prospects of civil servants at all levels of the bureaucracy. Government,\nincluding  the  civil  service,  needs  to  take  the  lead  in  this  dialogue  and  convince  civil  society,\nparliament, and the public of their commitment to a reform program.\n\n64.\n Civil service reform is a long-term process, and requires a commitment over a period of\nten years or more to achieve lasting change. Sustaining commitment over an extended period\nuntil  tangible  results  of  the  reform  process  begin  to  emerge  is  difficult,  and  key  stakeholders\nmay  become  impatient  if  results  are  not  immediately  visible.  This  requires  careful  program\ndesign, to ensure that easier reforms that produce quick and visible results are combined with\nthe  longer  term,  more  difficult  reforms,  to  maintain  broad  support  for  the  reform  process.\nAppropriate  reward  mechanisms  must  be  made  available  to  those  who  champion  and  lead\nreforms  successfully.  More  importantly,  to  generate  such  broad  support,  it  is  critical  that  key\n\n                  \n\n13 Loan 559-NEP: Crop Intensification Program, for $4 million, approved on 15 December 1981.\n14 Loan 669-NEP: Second Crop Intensification Program, for $15 million, approved on 14 December 1983.\n15 Loan 924-NEP: Agriculture Program, for $55 million, approved on 24 November 1988.\n16 Loan 1040-NEP: Forestry Sector Program, for $40 million, approved on 23 October 1990.\n\n\f17\n\nstakeholders  be  involved  in  the  design  of  a  reform  program,  and  that  they  are  fully  consulted\nand participate in implementation. By raising public awareness and building advocacy coalitions,\nadopting  a  transparent  process  of  information  sharing,  and  involving  stakeholders,  support  for\nreforms is developed, and government commitment to them is increased.\n\n65.\nCare  needs  to  be  taken  in  the  design  of  reform  programs  to  ensure  that  the  scope  is\nappropriate to the capacity and needs of the country. The use of a blueprint technical approach\nso  often  found  in  reform  programs  around  the  world  has  in  most  cases  failed.  The  program\nscope  needs  to  be  simple,  achievable,  and  not  too  ambitious  in  terms  of  its  targets.  The\nobjectives  of  the  reform  program  need  to  be  clearly  specified,  with  monitorable  progress\nindicators  and  well-defined  responsibilities  among  implementing  agencies.  Reform  programs\noften  consist  of  various  levels  of  activity,  including  inputs,  processes,  outputs,  and  impacts.\nWhile success in implementing a program at all levels is required, there needs to be a constant\nfocus on impacts. The end result of a reform program must be clear evidence to the public that\nthe  reforms  have  produced  benefits  in  the  form  of  better  service  provision  and  other  intended\nprogram impacts.\n\n66.\nRelated  to  the  need  for  careful  program  design  is  the  need  to  phase  the  reforms\ncarefully  and  realistically.  The  capacity  and  culture  of  the  civil  service  need  to  be  taken  into\naccount.  The  key  principles  are  to  keep  the  program  relatively  simple,  implement  a  limited\nnumber  of  significant  reforms  at  a  time,  carefully  plan  the  phasing  of  reforms  with  full\nstakeholder participation, and allow for flexibility to test and make adjustments as needed. The\nphasing  of  reform  actions  must,  of  course,  result  in  tangible  and  specified  outcomes  and\nimpacts. Subsequent phases would then only follow if the initial stage has been successful.\n\n67.\nFinally,  the  operating  culture  of  the  bureaucracy  and  politicians,  and  its  impact  on  the\nway  in  which  the  civil  service  operates  need  to  be  taken  into  account.  This  requires  a  careful\nanalysis of the institutional context in which the reforms will be introduced. Reform interventions\nneed  to  be  realistic,  taking  into  account  the  prevailing  institutional  system,  and  need  to  take\nadvantage of the strengths in the system while mitigating its weaknesses.\n\nV.\n\nTHE REFORM PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n68.\nA  major  difficulty  in  achieving  development  effectiveness  in  Nepal  is  the  lack  of\nefficiency,  predictability,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  key  government  institutions.\nCapacity  building  for  improved  governance  is  a  critical  factor  for  achieving  the  Government\u2019s\noverarching  goal  of  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  Lack  of  support  and  political  instability\ncontributed  in  the  recent  past  to  failed  reform  efforts.    Currently,  governance  reform  is  a  key\nelement of the Government\u2019s broader economic and structural reform program, which seeks to\nsustain accelerated growth and economic stability.\n\n69.\nPoor  public  sector  governance  has  contributed  to  a  demoralized  bureaucracy,\ninappropriate  allocation  of  budget  resources,  and  ineffective  implementation  of  development\nprograms.  There  are  increasing  allegations  of  corruption  at  many  levels,  and  corruption\nrepresents  a  key  constraint  to  the  effective  delivery  of  essential  services.  Basic  institutions\nessential  to  the  effective  functioning  of  a  market  economy  do  not  exist  or  do  not  operate\neffectively.  Poor  governance  and  the  unsustainable  financial  performance  of  public  agencies\nwaste limited public resources, affect the quality and quantity of public and private investment,\nconstrain  the  level  of  economic  growth,  and  weaken  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction\n\n\f18\n\nprogram. The civil service also suffers from a significant gender imbalance. The GRP will seek\nto  remove  administrative,  financial,  and  gender  weaknesses  in  the  civil  service  by  introducing\ninstitutional  reforms  to  improve  transparency,  accountability,  predictability,  and  processes  for\nredressing gender imbalance.\n\n70.\nBy extending a governance reform loan, ADB will provide much needed support for the\npublic  administration  institution-building  process  in  Nepal.  ADB  is  an  appropriate  agency  to\nsupport governance reforms in Nepal because of previous and ongoing support in this area and\nbecause  many  of  ADB\u2019s  loans  and  TAs  include  components  seeking  to  improve  governance\nand service delivery. Accordingly, ADB has acquired considerable experience in this area. Also,\nbuilding  effective  institutions  is  the  strategic  approach  of  ADB  operations  in  Nepal.  ADB  has\nalready provided two TAs to assist the Government in developing and implementing the reform\nprogram.  Governance  reform  will  require  continuing  commitment  and  follow-up  support  from\nADB  and  other  aid  agencies  throughout  this  period  to  achieve  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  GRP.\nADB  has  the  appropriate  assistance  modality  (program  lending)  to  implement  governance\nreforms  in  conjunction  with  TA  from  other  agencies  for  institutional  support  to  implement  the\nreform  program.  While  different  lending  modalities  were  considered  for  this  loan,  including  a\nprogram cluster modality, it is felt that a program loan with three tranches for the first phase of\nthe reform program is appropriate, rather than a program loan with only one or two tranches, for\nwhich long-term commitment to reform might be lacking. The timing of tranche releases will be\nflexible,  and  contingent  upon  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  and  continued  commitment  to  the\nreforms.  The  specific  nature  of  tranche  conditions  is  also  somewhat  flexible,  since  details  of\nsome  tranche  conditions  will  be  developed  during  the  implementation  period,  with  the\nassistance of TA consultants.\n\nAs  mentioned  in  paras.  54-57,  the  GRP  supports  the  governance  priorities  and\n71.\nobjectives  of  a  number  of  external \nfor  governance\nimprovements  is  predicated  on  the  assumption  that  ADB  will  take  the  lead  in  providing\nassistance for governance reform. ADB\u2019s assistance for corporate and financial governance17 is\nrelated  to  the  governance  reform  program  and  is  part  of  ADB\u2019s  overall  strategy  to  improve\ngovernance in Nepal and build effective institutions to support sustainable development.\n\nfunding  agencies.  Their  support \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n72.\nThe overall goal of the governance reform program is to establish a civil service that is\nresults- and people-oriented and gender responsive. Such a civil service will contribute to higher\neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  objectives  of  the  program  are  to  (i)  develop  an\ninternal capacity within the Government to lead and undertake the governance reform agenda,\n(ii) improve the efficiency of the civil service, (iii) improve governance and ensure that corruption\nin  government  is  effectively  prosecuted  under  the  law,  (iv)  enhance  the  competence  and\nmotivation  of  civil  servants,  and  (v)  establish  processes  for  improving  performance  in  key\nministries. The underlying logic, based on past experience with reform within the Nepalese civil\nservice,  and  supported  by  international  experience,  is  that  the  program  objectives  need  to  be\nlimited  and  clearly  defined;  must  be  carefully  sequenced  to  build  on  each  other  (see\nAppendix 1); must address some of the central, core constraints to performance; and must allow\nfor  experimentation,  including  entirely  new  ways  of  doing  business.  This  flexible  process\napproach requires that details of many elements of the reform program will only emerge as the\n\n                  \n\n17 Loan 1811-NEP: Corporate and Financial Governance Project, for $7.3 million, approved on 14 December 2000;\nand  TA  3580-NEP:  Strengthening  Corporate  and  Financial  Governance,  for  $3.3  million,  approved  on  14\nDecember 2000.\n\n\f19\n\nprogram  is  being  implemented,  with  the  support  of  TA  consultants.  Accordingly,  the  program\nframework  and  policy  matrix  should  not  be  regarded  as  blueprints.  As  the  reform  program  is\nimplemented, details of some required actions will be developed, and some tranche conditions\nmay  also  have  to  be  adapted  to  evolving  circumstances,  upon  the  mutual  agreement  of  ADB\nand the Government.\n\nA. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\nImplementation of the action plan under the program will include a number of policy and\n73.\ninstitutional reforms to improve the performance of the civil service. The program framework is\nprovided  in  Appendix  2.  The  reform  policies  and  actions  are  summarized  in  the  draft  Policy\nMatrix  and  Development  Policy  Letter  (Appendix  3).  The  five  proposed  components  of  the\nreform program and related actions are described in this section.\n\n1.\n\nDevelop an Internal Capacity for Leading Reform\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  ambitious  and  broad  GRP  will  require  strong  leadership  and\n74.\nmanagement  at  both  the  political  and  bureaucratic  levels.  Senior  politicians  and  bureaucrats\ntogether  need  to  lead  and  reinforce  improvement  on  key  government  management  structures\nand processes for leading and supporting the reform effort. The objective of this component of\nthe GRP is to improve these key management structures for leading and supporting the reform\neffort. As part of its ongoing reform initiatives, the Government has already put these structures\nin  place.  A  principal  element  of  this  component  will  be  to  maintain  an  effective  cabinet\nsubcommittee  (ARCMC,  see  para.  24)18  and  secretary-level  executive  committee19  to  provide\nstrategic  leadership  for  the  reform  program.  ARCMC  has  already  been  expanded  to  include\nministers  from  key  service  delivery  ministries  such  as  health,  education,  agriculture,  and\nwomen. The minister of MOGA is directing the executive committee, which has been expanded\nto include secretaries of the same ministries represented in ARCMC.\n\n75.\nFurther,  GRCU  in  MOGA  and  the  Efficiency  Unit  in  MOF  have  been  established  and\nstaffed  as  change  units  to  coordinate,  direct,  and  support  reforms  in  other  ministries  and\ndepartments.  Change  management  units  have  also  been  established  and  consolidated  in  the\nthree line ministries (MOAC, MOES, and MOH) responsible for implementing the reforms. The\ncabinet  subcommittee  and  the  executive  committee  will  set  policies,  and  the  change  units  in\nMOGA,  MOF,  and  the  three  pilot  ministries  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  them.  The\nexecutive committee will review and approve the annual progress of the GRP and prepare an\nannual  public  report  that  includes  information  on  the  Government\u2019s  success  in  increasing\nwomen\u2019s  representation  in  the  civil  service.  Appendix  4  depicts  these  implementation\narrangements.\n\nA clearly articulated strategy and gender sensitive annual action plans to guide the GRP,\n76.\nbased  on  the  policy  matrix  conditionalities  and  required  outputs  and  actions  contained  in  the\nprogram framework, will be developed and implemented by GRCU, the Efficiency Unit in MOF,\nand  the  three  change  units  in  MOAC,  MOES,  and  MOH.  The  plans  will  include  tactics  and\n\n                  \n\n18 Chaired by the Prime Minister, with membership including the minister of General Administration; the ministers of\nFinance,  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives,  Education  and  Sports,  Health,  Women  Children  and  Social  Welfare;\nchairman of PSC; vice-chairman of the National Planning Commission; chief secretary; and joint secretary of the\nMonitoring Division in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office as member secretary.\n\n19  Chaired  by  the  minister  of  General  Administration,  with  membership  including  the  chief  secretary,  secretaries  of\nCIAA, MOAC, MOES, MOF, MOGA, MOH, Law and Justice, National Planning Commission, PSC, Prime Minister\u2019s\nOffice, Women Children and Social Welfare, and joint secretary of MOGA as member secretary.\n\n\f20\n\nsequencing  of  actions  to  support  the  implementation  of  governance  reforms  by  building\nconsensus.  The  executive  committee  has  approved \nreform\nimplementation plan as a first tranche condition. There will be several main outputs of the first\ncomponent to develop an internal leadership capability for reform. These include the processes\nfor  implementing  the  reform  program,  reviewing  progress,  consulting  with  stakeholders,  and\nreporting.\n\nfirst  year\u2019s  overall \n\nthe \n\n77.\nInternational  experience  in  governance  reform  has  shown  that  strong  commitment  of\ngovernment and key stakeholders to the reform process, and the success of reform efforts, are\nreinforced by meaningful involvement of civil society in the design and implementation of reform\nprograms. For this reason support will be provided for public awareness campaigns and other\nactivities  to  help  quickly  foster  broad-based  support  for  governance  reform  in  Nepal.  The\nsupport  will  target  key  stakeholders,  including  politicians,  civil  service  unions,  nongovernment\nand  other  civil  society  organizations,  the  media,  academia,  and  the  general  public.  GRCU,\nsupported  by  TA,  will  work  continuously  with  civil  society  and  NGOs  active  in  the  governance\narea  to  build  a  coalition  advocating  reform,  and  to  obtain  feedback  on  the  program\u2019s\nimplementation. GRCU will also keep the public informed of developments concerning the GRP.\nIn  essence,  this  component  seeks  to  put  in  place  the  structures  and  leadership  within  and\noutside government by which sequenced governance reform actions as defined in the GRP are\nadvocated and implemented. In addition, an independent NGO or individual under TA support\nwill monitor GRP implementation and provide and publicize reports on results achieved.\n\n2.\n\nImprove the Efficiency of the Civil Service\n\nThe objective of this component is to generate as quickly as possible the fiscal savings\n78.\nby  \u201crightsizing\u201d  government  and  improving  personnel  management  processes  and  systems  to\nsupport  enhanced  performance  and  outcomes.  A  combination  of  measures  will  be  required  to\ngenerate quickly the efficiency gains needed to improve the remuneration levels of civil servants\n(part  of  component  4),  since  it  is  very  unlikely  that  any  one  action  will  produce  the  volume  of\nfiscal  savings  required.  One  of  the  key  outputs  of  this  component  will  be  to  reduce  personnel\nlevels and expenditures directly by attrition, and through targeted redundancy schemes as early\nas possible.  As a second tranche condition, the Efficiency Unit in MOF and GRCU will review\nand refine financial scenarios and conditions of the existing VERS to develop an affordable and\nfinancially  viable  VERS  for  government  approval  and  submission  of  amendments  to  the  Civil\nService Act to Parliament.\n\nBased  on  the  functional  review  work  of  all  ministries  previously  completed  under  TA\n79.\n3117, prior to the second tranche GRCU, the MOF Efficiency Unit, and the pilot ministry change\nunits  will  prepare  a  gender-sensitive  policy  and  detailed  plans  for  approval  by  the  executive\ncommittee  to  abolish,  contract  out,  privatize,  or  delegate  noncore  functions  of  government  to\nrelevant  agencies,  including  functions  such  as  driving  senior  officials  and  maintenance.  Some\nkey functions such as agricultural extension, primary education, and health services will also be\ndevolved to local authorities starting in FY2002. Consultations will be held with key stakeholders\nincluding  politicians,  civil  society,  business,  and  civil  service  unions  to  present  the  model  and\nrationale  for  devolving  noncore  functions  and  the  type  of  transactions,  scope,  and  proposed\ntiming.  A  framework  for  regulating  and  monitoring  devolved  noncore  functions  will  be  put  in\nplace.  Establishing  and  implementing  a  program  for  restructuring  the  civil  service  around  its\ncore  activities  will  not  only  help  achieve  quick  efficiency  gains  through  \u201crightsizing\u201d  to  gain\nsupport  for  the  program,  but  will  also  introduce  processes  to  contribute  to  performance\nimprovement (the objective of component 5).\n\n\f21\n\nA  modern  personnel  information  system  is  needed  to  provide  accurate  and  timely\n80.\ninformation on personnel numbers, vacancies, staff movements, and payroll to support efficient\nmanagement of the establishment (approved posts) and payroll, and to support preparation of\nlonger  term  policies  on  pay  and  employment.  A  system  will  be  finalized  to  provide  a\ncomputerized linkage between the personnel information system and the payroll by the second\ntranche.  Data  will  be  used  to  establish  the  true  nature  of  the  wage  bill  and  develop  effective\ncontrols on its key elements. An important target will be to improve the system for determining\nthe  number  of  posts  in  the  civil  service  establishment  and  the  financing  of  the  wage  bill.\nComputerization of the civil service database will be completed by the end of 2001, and linked\nto the payroll during 2002 (prior to the second tranche). The number of temporary civil servants\nhired  under  the  development  budget  will  continue  to  be  reduced.  School  enrolments  and\nnumbers  of  teachers  in  primary  and  secondary  schools  will  be  audited,  and  the  number  of\nteachers employed will be reduced according to actual enrolment by the second tranche. Such\nmeasures  will  be  implemented  quickly  to  avoid  a  protracted  process  of  finding  sufficient\nefficiency savings to justify moving to the next stage of reform. The longer it takes to generate\nefficiency  gains,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  support  for  and  commitment  to  reform  will  be\nundermined.\n\n3.\n\nImprove Governance and Reduce Corruption in Government\n\nThe  objectives  of  this  component  are  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  for  combating\n81.\ncorruption,  enforce  its  implementation,  and  ensure  the  involvement  of  civil  society  in  the\nanticorruption  efforts  of  the  Government.  The  key  actions  under  the  component  will  include\nlegislative changes for prevention and enforcement, implementation and enforcement of existing\nand  proposed  legislation,  institution  building  for  key  anticorruption  bodies,  and  raising\nawareness  among  citizens  of  the  role  of  key  anticorruption  agencies  and  how  to  become\ninvolved in reducing corruption. Legislation will be finalized or enforced to require elected public\nrepresentatives  and  civil  servants  to  declare  their  assets  annually  by  the  second  tranche.\nLegislation  requiring  an  annual  financial  audit  of  all  political  parties  will  be  submitted  and\nenforced.  The  Government  has  already  submitted  to  Parliament  the  amendments  to  the  CIAA\nAct  to  enhance  its  independence,  the  amended  bill  on  specialized  courts,  and  the  bill  on\nprevention  of  corruption.  A  special  CIAA  cadre  is  currently  being  established,  recruited,  and\ntrained with the assistance of TA 3622 to investigate individuals suspected of corrupt practices.\nTA  3622  consultants  are  also  assisting  CIAA  to  develop  a  program  to  combat  money\nlaundering.  This  capacity  building  will  be  extended  to  district  administration  offices  with  an\naction plan and will be linked directly to the overall operations of the prosecution process and in\nparticular CIAA.\n\n82.\nManagement  audits  of  staff  transfers  and  placements  will  be  regularly  conducted  by\nMOGA.  Additional  anticorruption  legislation  will  be  submitted  by  the  third  tranche  including\nlegislation  to  protect  those  providing  evidence  in  corruption  cases  (\u201cwhistleblower  protection\u201d)\nand legislation on antimoney laundering. The Cabinet Secretariat will develop rules of procedure\nfor use by the Constitutional Council. A public awareness campaign to inform the public about\nCIAA  functions  and  complaints  procedures  will  also  be  initiated  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office\nprior  to  the  second  tranche,  and  continuously  thereafter.  The  interactive  campaign  will  inform\nthe  public  about  CIAA  procedures,  the  targets  that  it  sets  itself  for  action,  and  the  constraints\nand risks that need to be overcome to achieve these targets.\n\n\f22\n\n4. \n\nEnhance the Competence and Motivation of Civil Servants\n\n83.\nCivil  servants  in  Nepal  have  low  motivation  and  often  lack  necessary  skills  and\ncompetencies to do a better job. The objective of this component is to increase their motivation\nand  skills  by  adopting  modern  human  resource  management  principles.  To  increase  staff\nmotivation,  a  critical  element  of  the  component  will  be  to  adopt  by  the  second  tranche  a\nlong-term pay policy with a revised civil service salary structure to enhance pay and widen pay\ndifferentials.  The  differentials  will  underpin  incentives  for  improvement  in  performance.  The\nGovernment  will  also  approve  as  a  second  tranche  condition  an  affirmative  action  policy  and\nprogram to increase the representation of women in the civil service, including the percentage of\nwomen occupying senior positions.\n\nTo  strengthen  recruitment  and  promotion  of  staff  based  on  merit,  the  personnel\n84.\nadministration  function  in  MOGA  will  be  strengthened  with  additional  qualified  staff  and\nimprovement  of  personnel  systems.  Civil  service  recruitment  and  promotion  will  be  reformed\nbased  on  merit  principles,  which  will  lead  to  promotions  founded  on  transparent  and\naccountable performance. GRCU will work together with PSC to develop merit criteria and the\ncapacity to apply merit-based procedures, with appropriate attention to gender issues. The Civil\nService  Act  will  be  amended  by  the  second  tranche  to  institutionalize  merit-based  principles,\nreduce  political  interference  in  transfers  and  placements,  and  strengthen  grievance  and\ndisciplinary  procedures.  In  the  development  and  application  of  merit-based  principles,\nstakeholders  will  be  consulted  to  reach  agreement  on  reducing  the  pervasive  system  of\npatronage.  Desirable  leadership  qualities  for  senior  civil  servants  will  be  developed  by  the\nsecond tranche through training and will be applied in promotion procedures; and management\nand skill development programs for selected civil servants will be introduced. Induction training\nfor  new  gazetted  officers  will  also  be  improved  as  a  second  tranche  condition.  Definition  of\ninstitutional  responsibilities  and  legal  and  regulatory  changes  will  accompany  these  reforms.\nThe  actions  required  to  implement  the  new  processes  will  be  consistent  with  the  focus  on\nperformance-based management processes. A very important aspect of this component will be\nthat all human resource management measures will be developed with utmost care to address\nissues related to women and increasing their participation in the civil service.\n\n5.\n\nEstablish Processes for Improving Performance in Key Ministries\n\n85.\nThe aim of this component is to deliver better services to citizens by reinforcing a new\npublic  management  culture  and  work  processes  that  are  related  to  performance-based\nmanagement  in  selected  service  and  central  ministries.  Three  service  delivery  ministries\n(MOAC,  MOES,  and  MOH)  and  two  central  ministries  (MOF  and  MOGA)  will  be  supported\nunder  this  component.  Management  performance  plans  will  be  developed  for  GRCU  and  the\nMOF Efficiency Unit, which are the focal points for leading the reform program. These plans will\nbuild on past TA work, and will include all areas of the ministries with a view to improving their\nown performance and transferring new procedures and capacities for support to the three pilot\nline ministries. All of the TA components will provide GRCU, the Efficiency Unit in MOF and the\nchange units of the three respective line ministries, with customized training, and mentoring to\nensure that needed leadership and technical skills are available for the design of the appropriate\nmanagement  and  performance  plans  and  their  subsequent  implementation.  The  central  focus\nwill  be  to  establish  the  culture  and  processes  related  to  performance-based  management  for\nselected public sector entities, and demonstrate the budget incentives, efficiency dividends, and\nbenefits in terms of improved outcomes.\n\n\f23\n\nAnnual  performance  improvement  plans,  including  client  service  standards,  will  be\n86.\ndeveloped for the three line ministries (MOAC, MOES and MOH) and publicized by the second\ntranche for MOAC, and by the third tranche for MOES and MOH. The annual plans will include a\nreview  process  to  identify  further  performance  improvements  and  service  quality  standards.\nPerformance  plans  will  include  performance  indicators  for  programs  under  improvement.  For\nexample,  a  universal  primary  education  performance  plan  may  include  measures  in  terms  of\nnumber  of  children  educated,  student/teacher  ratios,  and  number  of  children  successfully\nfinishing the school year. Such performance plans will also establish accountability and lead to\nefficiency savings. A key feature of the plans that will facilitate reform and provide incentives for\nthe  three  line  ministries  will  be  the  possibility  of  retaining  efficiency  savings  within  a\nmedium-term  expenditure  management  framework.  To  access  these  savings,  a  performance\nimprovement  fund  will  be  introduced  in  a  phased  manner  starting  by  the  second  tranche  and\nprovided to ministries that successfully introduce performance improvement plans. Institutional\narrangements  for  the  implementation  of  such  a  fund  will  be  designed  prior  to  the  second\ntranche. The fund will be used for skills development, improved business processes, engaging\nspecialist  staff,  and  purchase  of  needed  equipment  such  as  computers.  Management  and  in-\nservice  training  will  be  provided  to  develop  the  skills  needed  to  analyze  current  problems,\ndesign possible business solutions, and hence improve ministry performance as specified in the\nperformance  improvement  plans.  Annual  reports  on  the  execution  of  the  performance\nimprovement plans will be made public.\n\n87.\nIt is important to note that the improvements sought in these ministries are sequenced\ntowards the end of the first phase of the reform program, since they need to be supported by the\nother GRP initiatives. Senior management leadership and direction are needed so that middle\nmanagers  will  be  motivated  to  introduce  the  needed  new  processes.  Staff  discontent  with  the\nterms  and  conditions  of  their  employment\u2014pay  levels,  promotions,  transfers,  grievance\nprocedures,  and  issues  of  inequality\u2014needs  to  be  remedied  so  that  they  are  motivated.  A\nmerit-based  promotion  system \ntransparency,  and\naccountability  needs  to  be  introduced  as  part  of  the  process  of  increasing  motivation.  The\nneeded  training  and  improved  working  conditions  that  can  result  from  the  performance\nimprovement  fund  need  to  be  approved,  but  based  on  targeted  savings  from  cost  reduction\nmeasures, so that there will be an opportunity for the plans to effect the needed improvements\nin  service  delivery  standards.  Equally,  through  the  communications  program  with  civil  society\nand the independent program reporting mechanism, demand for services at appropriate levels\nneeds to be established and maintained.\n\nis  centered  on  performance, \n\nthat \n\nD.\n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n1. \n\nGeneral  Social Issues\n\nThe  planned  GRP  will  introduce  significant  reforms  in  all  sectors  for  which  the\n88.\nGovernment is responsible, including critical social sectors such as agriculture, education, and\nhealth. Service delivery will be divided between central and local bodies, with improved service\ndelivery in the agriculture, education, and health sectors contributing to improvements in social\nwelfare. Attempts will be made to redress the gender imbalance in the civil service by adopting\nan  affirmative  action  plan  to  increase  the  representation  of  women  at  all  levels  of  the  civil\nservice, and to increase their participation in the reform process.\n\nThe GRP may lead to social costs caused by (i) reduced quality, timeliness, and volume\n89.\nof service delivery in the short term; and (ii) unemployment as a result of retrenchment of civil\nservants  in  agencies  that  are  overstaffed  or  in  non-essential  areas  of  the  civil  service.  The\n\n\f24\n\nreform process will necessarily be long term, and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness\nthat will lead to benefits from economic growth and poverty reduction may not all be immediate.\nReforms  of  ministries  and  other  agencies  may  result  in  incremental  funding  requirements  for\noffices, and should lead to improved working conditions through the provision of additional office\nspace;  better  equipment  and  facilities;  and  training,  capacity  building,  and  institutional  reforms\nfor  civil  servants.  These  improvements  will  require  provision  of  additional  budget  resources  to\nupgrade agency equipment.\n\nMeasures are incorporated into the program to mitigate possible negative impacts of the\n90.\nreforms.  The  Government  will  take  action  during  the  reform  process  to  (i)  strengthen  social\nsector reforms, (ii) mitigate any possible negative impacts of the governance reforms, and (iii)\nensure transparency and broad acceptance of the reform program to avoid any negative social\nimpact and build political support among all parties for the reforms.\n\n1. \n\nGovernance and Poverty\n\nGovernance reform will assist in poverty reduction through better allocation of resources\n91.\nand their more efficient use, more efficient social service delivery, and effective implementation\nof  targeted  programs.  Inefficient  social  service  delivery  contributes  to  the  low  human\ndevelopment indicators in Nepal and potentially to inequality because of the disparity in quality\nof  public  service  delivery  to  different  segments  of  society.  A  reformed  civil  service  with  high\nmorale,  transparency,  accountability,  and  a  high  degree  of  responsibility  will  not  only  promote\neconomic  growth  but  also  implement  other  service  delivery  and  targeted  poverty  reduction\nprograms more efficiently and cost effectively. There is therefore a need to reorient the role of\nthe bureaucracy to one of facilitation and regulation within a competitive market economy.\n\n92.\n\u201cRightsizing\u201d of the bureaucracy is an important aspect of the reform measures, and, if\nnot properly designed and managed, could lead to large-scale retrenchment of employees, with\nresultant  negative  welfare  impacts.  Such  measures  need  to  be  carefully  designed,  discussed\nwith targeted employees, and implemented to minimize potential negative impacts. Ideally, both\nthe  Government  and  targeted  staff  should  benefit  from  such  programs,  creating  win-win\nsituations. This can be accomplished using the VERS, for instance.\n\n93.\nThe  full  participation  of  local  government  bodies  and  the  introduction  of  measures  to\nempower  socially  excluded  groups  and  women  will  lead  to  more  active  participation  of  these\nstakeholders  in  development  activities  and  thus  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty.  Local\ngovernment bodies are often in a better position to identify target groups and to formulate and\nimplement targeted programs. With the Local Self-Governance Act in place, central Government\ncivil  servants  posted  to  the  district  level  will  be  gradually  transferred  to  local  government\nauthorities.  This  will  eventually  result  in  the  creation  of  a  regional  cadre  of  civil  servants\nrecruited by local authorities and permanently based in the locality.\n\n1. \n\nGovernance and Gender\n\nAs  with  other  aspects  of  governance,  achieving  the  goals  of  gender  equality  as\n94.\nenunciated in the Ninth Plan will be possible only with strong political commitment, government\nintervention, and policy action. The low proportion of women in the civil service has unbalanced\nthe equilibrium of the civil service system and reduced pressure for the introduction of measures\nto  address  women's  interests  and  capacities.  The  Civil  Service  Act  was  amended  in  1993  to\ninclude  special  provisions  to  promote  women\u2019s  entry  into  the  civil  service;  but,  despite  these\n\n\f25\n\nmeasures,  studies  indicate  a  continuing  decline  in  women's  access  to  the  civil  service,  and  to\ndecision-making positions in particular.\n\n95.\nEntry into the civil service is contingent upon both men and women successfully passing\nthe  PSC  examinations.  However,  gender  inequality  in  schooling  and  formal  training,  women's\nlack  of  mobility  and  time  constraints  because  of  unequal  responsibility  for  household  chores,\nand  information  asymmetries  constrain  women  to  compete  successfully  for  entry  into  the  civil\nservice.  Government  offices  that  are  without  toilet  facilities  for  women;  and  the  timing  and\nlocation of PSC examinations are factors that women have identified as deterrents to their entry\nin the civil service. The Government has recently issued a directive to provide toilet facilities for\nwomen in all ministries.\n\nThe  GRP  will  address  gender  representation  imbalances  by  introducing  affirmative\n96.\naction  amendments  to  the  Civil  Service  Act.  The  amendments  will  focus  on  alleviating\nconstraints  and  creating  new  opportunities  for  women.  These  include  (i)  holding  special\ncoaching classes for women in the five development regions of Nepal to allow more women to\ntake and successfully pass the PSC examinations; (ii)  issuance of a directive to line ministries\nmandating  women\u2019s  participation  in  civil  service  staff  development  training  activities;    (iii)\ndeveloping a merit-based approach to recruitment and promotion, keeping in mind the current\ngender imbalances in the civil service system;  and  (iv)  developing new and gender-sensitive\napproaches to procedures and processes for handling grievance and transfer issues.\n\n97.\nTo secure horizontal integration of gender concerns in all stages of policy formulation (i)\nthe  executive  committee  will  include  the  secretaries  of  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and\nSocial Welfare; CIAA; and PSC; (ii) the change units in MOAC, MOES, and MOH will mandate\nwomen\u2019s representation in addition to assigning a gender focal point in each change unit;  (iii)\nGRCU will include a female staff member to ensure that women\u2019s concerns are reflected in the\nreform  process;  (iv)  PSC  will  designate  staff  to  liaise  with  GRCU  to  keep  itself  informed  of\nproposed gender reforms and provide feedback to GRCU; and (v) GRCU will be provided with\nTA  to  guide  and  monitor  progress  in  mainstreaming  gender  concerns.  To  mitigate  any  likely\nnegative  impact  on  women  while  \u201crightsizing\u201d  the  civil  service,  MOGA  in  consultation  with  the\nMinistry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Welfare,  will  prepare  a  promotion  scheme  that  will\noffset sociocultural impediments to women\u2019s career advancement, and an incentive mechanism\nto  retain  and  recruit  more  women.  These  will  focus  on  changes  in  legislation  and  regulations\nthat  include  provisions  that  women  have  identified  as  important,  and  that  increase  women\u2019s\nability to compete with men for high-paying positions. Examples include innovations in maternity\nleave, specific in-service training for women, and gender-friendly physical facilities.\n\n98.\nThe  achievement  of  gender-responsive  outputs  will  form  part  of  the  tranche  release\nconditions.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  approve  an  affirmative  action  policy  prior  to  the\nrelease of the second tranche to increase women\u2019s representation in the civil service, including\nmeasures  to  increase  the  percentage  of  women  in  decision-making  positions.  The  necessary\namendments to the Civil Service Act will be submitted to parliament prior to the second tranche.\n\n1. \n\nGovernance and Environment\n\n99.\nThe GRP seeks to make the civil service more efficient, effective, and service-oriented\nand  to  reduce  corruption  in  Nepal.  Reform  of  the  civil  service  is  concerned  primarily  with\nimproving  staff  capacities  and  institutional  performance,  and  involves  limited  construction\nactivities. Anticorruption initiatives will seek to prosecute individuals for contravening regulations\nfor  their  own  benefit.  In  general,  improved  public  sector  governance  leading  to  enhanced\n\n\f26\n\nefficiency,  predictability,  accountability,  and  transparency  will  lead  to  improved  environmental\nmanagement. Improved operation of government and anticorruption agencies should also lead\nto fewer cases of environmental degradation in contravention of existing laws and regulations.\n\nVI.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  23,484,000  or  $30\n100.\nmillion equivalent from its Special Funds resources to support the GRP. The proposed size of\nthe loan is based on the scope and depth of the reform program, and on the costs of mitigating\nthe  negative  social  impact  of  the  reforms,  such  as  possible  increases  in  unemployment  from\nretrenchment or privatization. In addition to such general impacts, it will be necessary to monitor\nspecific social impacts of the reform, for instance services that are devolved from the central to\nthe local level. The adjustment costs of implementing the GRP will be to some extent offset by\nthe savings achieved through reform actions (para. 129). Gross adjustment costs (excluding use\nof savings from the reforms) are estimated at $104.1 million in the short term (first four years of\nthe program) and $45.8 million from years 5 to 8 of the program. These costs include (i) the $63\nmillion cost of the VERS targeted at about 10,000 lower level civil servants;20 (ii) possible pay\npolicy changes of $37.7 million in the first phase of the program, and $37.7 million from years 5\nto  8  of  the  program;  (iii)  staff  induction  and  specialized  training  costs  of  $2  million;  (iv)  $1.5\nmillion  for  the  performance  improvement  fund  in  MOAC,  MOES,  and  MOH;  (v)  and  other\nmiscellaneous costs. The program adjustment costs and savings are indicated in Appendix 5.\n\nA. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n101.\nThe loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, 1 percent\ninterest  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  during  the  amortization  period,  and  equal\namortization. The borrower will be Nepal, and the loan will be utilized from December 2001 to\nDecember  2004,  with  the  actual  program  period  extending  to  December  2005  to  allow  for\nfollow-up monitoring of program actions.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n102.\nThe reform program will be initiated across the civil service at the central and local level\nin a phased manner from 2001 to 2005. This will provide the time required for capacity building\nand institutional strengthening of government agencies based on the experiences learned from\nimplementation of the reforms in the first five core ministries. Specific TA requirements to assist\nin these areas were identified and are described in paras. 116-124 and in Appendix 6.\n\nThe EA for the program loan will be MOGA. ADB will regularly monitor the progress of\n103.\nthe  GRP,  with  the  support  of  the  Nepal  Resident  Mission  (NRM)\u2014in  particular,  through  the\ninvolvement  of  the  senior  governance  and  capacity  building  officer\u2014using  the  indicators\nincluded in Appendix 2.\n\n                  \n\n20 This includes the $16. 9 million cost incurred in FY2001 for early retirement of about 2,550 civil servants. DFID also\nplans to provide about $15 million budgetary support for the VERS, and conditionalities in IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction\nGrowth  Facilty\u2019s  structural  matrix  are  also  tied  to  VERS  implementation.  Therefore,  additional  support  for  these\ncosts is expected from sources other than ADB alone.\n\n\f27\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  program  will  receive  overall  guidance  from  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s\n104.\nARCMC  as  a  strategic  steering  group,  with  operational  supervision  provided  by  the  executive\ncommittee headed by the minister of MOGA. Overall coordination of all program details will be\nexercised  by  the  project  director,  who  will  be  the  head  of  GRCU,  under  the  guidance  of  the\nsecretary of MOGA.\n\n105.\nImplementation  arrangements  will  be  critical  to  the  success  of  the  reform  program.\nBased on the experiences of managing reform in both developed and developing countries, the\nfollowing  principles  have  guided  the  choice  of  these  arrangements.  First,  the  structures  for\nsetting the overall direction of the program should be well integrated within, not separate from,\nthe  Government\u2019s  normal  management  processes.  Second,  implementation  responsibility\nshould rest with line ministries but be supported by the core ministries of the Government. Third,\nchange units are needed in the core ministries to implement key change interventions. Fourth,\ncollective  ownership  of  reform  needs  to  be  secured  among  ministry  secretaries  for  reform  to\nsucceed in their individual ministries. Fifth, popular or civil society support for reform efforts is\nessential to ensure continued political support for the reform process, particularly with respect to\nreform measures that bear short-term political costs.\n\n106.\nThe  implementation  framework  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  is  provided  in\nAppendix 4. The framework incorporates three key functions, including (i) strategic leadership of\nthe  overall  program,  (ii)  support  for  specific  reform  actions,  and  (iii)  implementation\nresponsibilities throughout government.\n\n107. At  the  core  ministry  level,  program  teams  (GRCU  and  the  MOF  Efficiency  Unit)  have\nbeen  created  with  responsibility  for  different  aspects  of  the  reform  program.  These  teams  will\nsupport and facilitate the introduction of reforms in line ministries, departments, and agencies.\nTo ensure that ministries will implement a coherent overall program, as opposed to a series of\ndisparate components led by different ministries, GRCU will be responsible for coordinating and\nmonitoring the reform program and will report to the secretary of MOGA.\n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nFinally,  responsibility \n\n108.\nimplementation  of  performance  management  and\nimprovement  will  rest  primarily  with  the  line  ministries.  For  the  reforms  to  be  owned  by  the\nministries, they will need to have broad-based support from senior management. Therefore, it is\nproposed  that  specific  reform  programs  be  incorporated  within  the  agenda  of  the  ministries\u2019\nregular  management  meetings.  The  establishment  of  separate  change  units\u2014the  approach\nemployed to carry out the functional reviews under the TA to prepare the program\u2014will not work\non its own, since it tends to confine thinking about reform to a small group of people.    \n\nC. \n\nProcurement\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost  of\n109.\nitems produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items specified\nin the ineligible list shown in Appendix 7, and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral\nsources)  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  not  more  than  180  days  prior  to  loan\neffectiveness. Procurement of eligible items will be on the basis of normal commercial practices\nfor  procurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard  government  procurement  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public  sector,  except  that  in  the  case  of  goods\ncommonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets,  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in\naccordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Borrower  will  certify  that  the  volume  of\neligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan\nin a given period.\n\n\f28\n\nE. \n\nDisbursement\n\n110.\nThe  details  of  tranche  disbursement  were  carefully  studied  during  loan  processing,\nconsidering  previous  ADB  experiences  with  policy-based  lending.  Given  the  time  period\nrequired  to  implement  such  a  wide-ranging  reform  program,  and  the  need  to  have  continuous\ntests of the Government\u2019s commitment to the reform process, it was concluded that a program\nloan over a three-year period, with three tranches, is preferable, with a fourth year after the third\ntranche  to  continue  monitoring  the  program.  The  first  tranche  will  be  provided  following  the\nGovernment\u2019s  fulfillment  of  the  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness,  which  are  among  the  actions\ncontained in the Policy Matrix. The remaining tranches will be disbursed within 18 months of the\nprevious  tranche,  provided  that  tranche  and  loan  milestone  release  conditions  are  met.\nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. ADB will have\nthe  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s\ncertification.\n\nE. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n111.\nThe  counterpart  funds  in  local  currency  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\ndeposited  in  a  special  counterpart  fund  account  to  be  established  by  MOF  at  Nepal  Rastra\nBank, and will become part of the Government budget every year. MOGA and MOF will decide\non the allocation of the counterpart funds and closely monitor their use through GRCU and the\nMOF  Efficiency  Unit.  The  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to\nsupport the implementation of the governance program. Any counterpart funds not required for\nthe program will be used first to finance women\u2019s higher education and training.\n\n112. All  financial  transactions  of  the  special  counterpart  fund  account  will  be  recorded\nseparately  in  a  manner  that  allows  identification  of  expenditures  from  loan  proceeds  and\ncounterpart funds. The accounts, together with records of expenditures, will be audited annually\nby the auditor general of Nepal or independent auditors, whose qualifications, experience, and\nterms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  will  submit  to  ADB  certified\ncopies  of  audited  accounts  and  records  within  12  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.\nGRCU, in collaboration with the MOF Efficiency Unit, will prepare and furnish to the executive\ncommittee and ADB a progress report every four months in form and detail satisfactory to the\nexecutive  committee  and  ADB.  The  progress  report  will  particularly  cover  the  status  of\nimplementation of policy and institutional reform measures and related time-bound actions, the\nprogress  of  disbursements  of  loan  proceeds,  and  the  use  of  counterpart  funds.  Within  three\nmonths  of the  loan  closing  date, the Government will also submit to ADB a detailed report on\nthe  performance  of  the  proposed  loan.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  upon  the  format\nand contents of the report.\n\nE. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n1. \n\nMonitoring\n\n113. Monitoring  will  take  place  at  several  levels  and  by  several  entities,  consistent  with  the\nimplementation  arrangements  outlined  in  Appendix  4.  The  Government  will  take  overall\nresponsibility for overseeing the effective implementation of the GRP. For the GRP to succeed,\nthe cabinet and ARCMC must take overall responsibility for ensuring that it is well implemented.\nThe  executive  committee  will  take  responsibility  at  the  highest  level  of  the  civil  service,  while\nGRCU will continuously monitor the reform process. However, ultimately the three participating\n\n\f29\n\nline  ministries  must  take  ownership  of  the  reforms  to  the  extent  of  implementing  them  and\ncritically  monitoring  their  own  performance.  The  ARCMC  and  executive  committee  will  each\nmeet at least twice a year to provide overall policy and operational guidance to the program. An\nindependent  agency  will  also  be  recruited  to  monitor  program  performance,  and  will  prepare\nsemiyearly reports prior to ADB review missions. TA consultants will also monitor and support\nthe GRP.\n\n114.\nThe Government and ADB will jointly monitor and review the progress of implementation\nof the milestone and tranche performance conditions in the policy matrix to ensure that they are\nmet. Indicators and targets for the program are indicated in Appendix 2. More detailed indicators\nwill  be  developed  as  appropriate  by  the  consultants  of  TA  3622,  and  by  the  independent\nmonitoring agency. The Government will submit implementation progress reports to ADB as part\nof the review process every four months. The Government, ADB, and other key stakeholders,\nincluding interested funding agencies, will meet every six months to review progress. ADB will\nfield review missions every six months to coincide with the review meetings. One major review\nmeeting  should  be  held  prior  to  the  scheduled  release  of  the  next  loan  tranche.  GRCU  will\nsubmit a program completion report to ADB within three months after the loan closing date. The\nreport  will  evaluate  implementation  of  the  activities  and  outputs  under  the  GRP  components,\nand  the  impact  of  the  GRP  on  the  economy,  including  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  the\nreforms;  elaborate  the  lessons  learned  during  the  program;  and  identify  the  required  future\nreform program and assistance required.\n\n1. \n\nTranching\n\nThe GRP is already being implemented, supported by TA provided by ADB. The loan is\n115.\nestimated to be of four years duration from the date of effectiveness.  The loan proceeds will be\ndisbursed in three tranches, with the first tranche of $12 million equivalent followed by two equal\ntranches  of  $9  million  equivalent  approximately  18  months  after  the  release  of  the  previous\ntranche. The first tranche will be released upon completion of the normal approval processes for\nthe  loan,  with  the  succeeding  tranches  released  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  fulfillment  of  the\nconditions  for  their  release  (including  milestones),  which  are  contained  in  the  policy  matrix\n(Appendix  3).  This  approach  has  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  Government  shows  its  firm\ncommitment to the reform process throughout the program period by meeting specified tranche\nand loan milestone conditions to the satisfaction of ADB. Because a flexible process approach\nis  being  used  for  program  implementation,  details  regarding  some  tranche  conditions  will\nbecome  available  only  after  the  TA  consultants;  GRCU;  the  MOF  Efficiency  Unit;  and  the\nMOAC,  MOES,  and  MOH  change  management  units  have  developed  and  approved  policies\nand  performance  improvement  implementation  plans.  The  Government\u2019s  continuation  of  the\nVERS,  because  of  limited  funds,  will  necessarily  be  related  to  its  performance  in  meeting  the\ntranche conditions in the policy matrix.\n\nVII.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n116. Based on the five program components that have been identified, TA assistance will be\nrequired  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  change  and  program  management,  (ii)  efficiency\nimprovements  in  government,  (iii)  improving  governance  and  reducing  corruption,  (iv)  human\nresource  management,  (v)  performance  management,  (vi)  civil  society  support  for  reform\nmeasures, and (vii) independent program monitoring. TA will be provided to both GRCU and the\nMOF Efficiency Unit, and to the MOAC, MOES, and MOH change units. The primary role of the\nTA personnel will be to provide technical support and to transfer skills and knowledge to the five\nunits. ADB and the Government are finalizing funding from bilateral agencies to finance the TA,\n\n\f30\n\ngiven  ADB\u2019s  TA  resource  constraints.  Discussions  have  been  held  concerning  cofinancing  of\nthe  TA  package  with  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  DANIDA,  DFID,  and\nSDC, which have all indicated their interest.\n\nteam \n\nincluding \n\nleadership  and  change  management,  efficiency \n\nThe  TA  will  be  packaged  into  three  separate  contracts  dealing  with  (i)  core  program\n117.\nimprovements,\nreform, \nimproving  governance  and \nresource  management,  and\nreducing  corruption,  human \nperformance management, which will also address issues of gender; (ii) civil society support for\nthe reform measures; and (iii) independent program monitoring. An international consulting firm\nin  association  with  a  local  firm  will  implement  the  first  contract  beginning  in  November  2002,\nafter  the  ongoing  TA  3622  is  completed,  while  local  firms  or  organizations  will  implement  the\nsecond  and  third  contracts  beginning  in  early  2002,  with  the  possibility  of  an  individual\nundertaking the third contract. The consultants will be engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants for TA administered by ADB. Outline terms of reference for the three\nTA packages are in Appendix 6.\n\nA. \n\nPackage One \u2014 Core Program Reform\n\n 118. There are five subpackages of this consultancy. The first will support the first component\nof  the  GRP.  An  international  change  and  program  management  specialist  with  experience  in\nteam leadership will be provided for 18 months to support GRCU and the MOF Efficiency Unit,\nand  the  change  units  in  the  three  line  ministries,  ensure  consistency  in  the  TA  approach,\neffectively manage the various consultants, and establish appropriate working relationships with\ncivil  service  counterparts.  A  domestic  deputy  team  leader  will  support  the  international\nconsultant for a 24-month period.\n\n119.\nThe second consultancy subpackage will support the second component of the GRP\u2014to\nimprove the overall efficiency of the civil service. The Efficiency Unit in MOF will be responsible\nfor  introducing  measures  to  generate  fiscal  savings  in  line  ministries,  particularly  to  identify\nnoncore  functions  of  government  that  can  be  delegated  to  corporate  agencies,  privatized,\ncontracted  out,  eliminated,  or  devolved  to  local  authorities.  An  international  specialist  in\ndevolving  government  functions  supported  by  a  domestic  consultant  will  provide  inputs  of  six\nand eight person-months respectively. A key objective of this subpackage will also be to enable\nthe Government to control the public service wage bill through effective establishment controls.\nAn  international  specialist  in  payroll  systems  development  and  application,  supported  by  a\ndomestic consultant will provide inputs of five and six person-months respectively.\n\n120.\nThe  third  consultancy  subpackage  will  support  the  third  component  of  the  GRP\u2014to\nimprove  governance  and  reduce  corruption  in  government.  An  international  anticorruption\nspecialist supported by domestic consultant will provide four and six person-months of support\nrespectively  to  assist  in  preparing  new  anti-corruption  legislation  and  further  training  for  anti-\ncorruption agency staff.\n\n121.\nThe fourth consultancy subpackage will support the fourth component of the GRP, which\ninvolves  a  multifaceted  approach  to  enhancing  competence  that  addresses  the  selection,\nmotivation,  and  development  of  personnel  using  modern  principles  of  human  resource\nmanagement.  An  international  specialist  in  civil  service  administrative  procedures,  leadership,\ntraining, and building institutional gender capacity will provide an input of three person-months,\nsupported by eight person-months of domestic input.\n\n\f31\n\nThe  fifth  consultancy  subpackage  will  support  the  fifth  component  of  the  program\u2014to\n122.\nestablish processes for improving performance and service delivery in a limited number of key\nministries  once  key  institutional  barriers  have  been  removed.  International  and  domestic\nperformance management specialists will support GRCU, the MOF Efficiency Unit, and the line\nministry  change  units.  It  is  envisaged  that  this  expertise  will  be  required  for  a  period  of  10\nperson-months of international consultant input, and 12 person-months of domestic input.\n\nA. \n\nPackage Two \u2014 Civil Society Support for the Reform Measures\n\n123.\nThis package of consultancy inputs will cut across and support all areas of the program.\nIn  the  past,  reforms  have  been  introduced  in  Nepal  with  minimal  dialogue  with  concerned\nstakeholders.  Consultations  with  civil  society  will  be  held  throughout  the  reform  process  to\nobtain  a  broad  spectrum  of  views  concerning  needed  reforms,  to  inform  the  public  of  planned\nreforms,  and  to  solicit  widespread  support  and  advocacy  for  the  overall  reform  process,\nparticularly by the active group of existing governance NGOs. Other stakeholders such as civil\nservants and their unions, and politicians will also be consulted and involved in the refinement\nand  implementation  of  the  reforms.  Consultant  inputs  for  the  two  subcomponents  will  total  44\nperson-months of domestic specialists.\n\nC.\n\nPackage Three \u2014 Program Monitoring and Reporting\n\n124.\nThis  consultancy  input  will  also  cover  all  the  objectives  of  the  program,  since  it  will\nprovide  an  independent  review  and  reporting  mechanism,  ensuring  that  all  stakeholders,  and\nparticularly civil society, have detailed information on the program goals, plans, implementation\nsuccesses, and failures. The contract will be awarded to a domestic individual or organization\nsuch as an NGO to promote greater transparency in government performance within the defined\nparameters  of  this  important  reform  initiative.  Consultant  input  of  12  person-months  will  be\nrequired over the program period.\n\nVIII.\n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits\n\n125.\nIntroducing  a  \u201crightsized,\u201d  better  remunerated,  and  motivated  civil  service,  trained\ntowards concepts of \u201ccustomer\u201d service, with openness in its attempts to provide such service is\na  lofty  goal,  and  one  that  may  well  take  many  years  of  sustained  effort  to  achieve.  The  GRP\nsupports  the  initial  but  vital  steps  of  such  a  long-term  vision.  It  will  promote  some  of  the  key\nunderpinnings,  pilot  new  approaches  such  as  performance  plans,  service  delivery  standards,\nand devolution of functions; and attempt to deal with issues of governance that currently hamper\nefficiency and lead to distrust in government operations. The program specifically targets some\nof  the  most  important  motivational  and  institutional  factors,  that  when  strengthened  can  be\nessential  building  blocks  to  achieve  needed  changes.  It  also  addresses  corruption,  by\ndelineating  a  legislative  agenda  as  well  as  institutional  strengthening  mechanisms  to  reduce\ncorruption  both  at  the  political  and  civil  service  level.  These  steps  are  needed  to  lay  the\nfoundations  of  the  long  course  towards  meeting  the  vision  of  the  GRP,  and  also  because  the\ncurrent operations of the civil service have fallen below the levels of acceptability, with a greatly\nreduced capacity to positively impact poverty through the proper utilization of resources.\n\nThe  program  provides  an  opportunity  for  government  to  clearly  demonstrate  to  the\n126.\nNepalese people that the civil service can be made more people- and service-oriented, resulting\nin  better  and  deeper  provision  of  services  in  key  social  sectors\u2014agriculture,  education,  and\n\n\f32\n\nhealth.  It  also  introduces  for  the  first  time  the  concept  of  \u201ctaxpayer  rights\u201d  in  the  designs  for\neliciting the views of civil society into the program scope, feeding back performance results, and\nutilizing  civil  society  to  check  on  key  provision  of  services  at  the  grassroots  level.  Within  a\nsociety  that  has  not  understood  that  modern  governments  should  be  obligated  towards  the\nconcept  of  service,  these  changes,  if  successful,  could  provide  the  underpinnings  for  radical\nchanges in the way services are expected, provided, and accepted.\n\n127. Other  design  features  of  the  program,  particularly  within  the  legal  framework  for\nimproved  governance,  have  the  potential  to  increase  greatly  the  transparency  of  government\nactions, with a resulting decrease in forms of behavior that are incompatible with efficiency and\nservice  delivery.  Again, \nthe  program\u2019s  reporting\nfull  disclosure  by  government  under \nmechanisms could greatly increase the trust and respect of the populace, while also serving to\neducate and better inform people about issues of financial propriety. By stressing consultation\nwith  and  participation  of  key  stakeholders  and  civil  society  and  by  emphasizing  raising  public\nawareness for governance, the program goes a long way to creating an open work environment\nand changing citizens\u2019 attitudes towards government.\n\n128.\nThis program is but the first step in what is likely to be a lengthy transition. As such it is\nnot  comprehensive;  rather  it  selects  key  aspects  within  the  features  and  characteristics  of  the\ncurrent  civil  service  regime  that  government  believes  deserve  attention  and  that  can  be  the\nbuilding  blocks  upon  which  further  reforms  can  be  introduced,  refined,  and  implemented.  The\nchoice of three line ministries whose mission is intimately tied to service to the public and that\ndeliver  these  services  within  the  whole  territory  of  Nepal  makes  success  of  the  initial  phase\nimportant to diffuse eventually the learning from it to the rest of the public service. If successful,\nfurther expansion of the concepts and programs should be much easier than the initial phase.\n\n129. A  number  of  benefits  or  savings  will  accrue  to  the  government  from  implementation  of\nthe GRP measures. These are estimated to total approximately $104.1 million for the first four\nyears  of  the  program,  and  $243.9  million  from  years  5  to  8  of  the  program.  Savings  from  the\nefficiencies that will be achieved under component 2 of the GRP include (i) salary and benefit\nsavings  from  the  voluntary  early  retirement  of  10,000  employees  of  about  $14.4  million  in  the\nfirst four years of the program, and $9.2 million from years 5 to 8; (ii) total savings from abolition\nof  positions  through  attrition  of  about  $11.5  million;  (iii)  savings  from  contracting  out  and\ndevolution  of  functions  of  $32  million;  (iv)  savings  from  decentralization  of  functions  of  $32\nmillion; (v) savings from better management of temporary contract positions of $10.5 million; (vi)\nsavings  of  $40.5  million  from  performance  improvements;  and  (vii)  savings    through  effective\nimplementation of the medium-term expenditure management framework of $197.9 million. The\nsavings  obtained  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  GRP  can  be  used  to  contribute  to  the\nfinancing  of  program  adjustment  costs,  leading  to  a  decrease  in  the  gross  adjustment  cost\nmentioned  in  para.  100,  and  to  finance  salary  increases  for  civil  servants.  For  instance,  the\nestimated  net  fiscal  savings  in  the  first  four  years  of  the  program  would  permit  a  14  percent\nincrease in the wage bill. The estimated savings from the program are contained in Appendix 5.\n\nA. \n\nProgram Impact\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n130.\nThe  impact  of  governance  reform  measures  on  poverty  is  elaborated  in  Appendix  8.\nPoverty issues are directly addressed by the GRP through the positive impact that it will have on\nservice delivery to the poor and socially excluded groups, and their increased participation and\nempowerment.  While  some  unemployment  can  be  expected  because  of  retrenchment  of\n\n\f33\n\nemployees,  careful  management  of  such  \u201crightsizing\u201d  using  the  VERS  would  benefit  both  the\nGovernment and the affected employees.\n\n131.\nThe  potential  benefits  of  effective  implementation  of  governance  reform  measures  are\nsubstantial  and  extensive,  affecting  the  entire  nation  and  economy.  Growth  prospects  will  be\nimproved because of the introduction of measures to enhance efficiency and control corruption.\nThese  measures  have  the  potential  to  stimulate  private  sector  productivity  and  investment.\nAttainment  of  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  of  propoor,  broad-based  economic\ngrowth will be promoted, and the increase in growth will reduce the incidence of poverty through\nemployment  promotion  and  through  increases  in  labor  productivity.  The  improved  provision  of\npublic  services  for  social  priority  sectors  and  the  enhanced  quality  of  these  public  goods  and\nservices will augment labor productivity and consequently employee wage levels.\n\n2. \n\nGender Impact\n\n132. By  making  gender  responsiveness  a  key  part  of  the  overall  goal,  the  GRP  effectively\nlinks  gender  awareness  in  policy  and  programs  to  equitable,  efficient,  and  sustainable\noutcomes.  The  GRP  will  contribute  to  redistributing  power  and  equitable  access  to  economic\nopportunity and social resources by securing more appropriate gender representation. This will\ncontribute  to  reforming  the  bureaucracy  to  improve  service  delivery,  and  will  have  a  positive\nimpact  on  reducing  poverty.  Improving  gender  responsiveness  is  part  of  an  overall  process  of\ninstitutional  reform  that  will  be  achieved  by  systematically  mainstreaming  gender  into  the\ninternal organizational structure, personnel policies, and working conditions of the civil service.\nAffirmative  action  will  increase  women\u2019s  options  to  participate  in  the  civil  service  and  actively\nincrease  women\u2019s  control  and  command  over  resources.  In  addition,  opportunities  for  broad\npublic debate will create the processes for greater participation of civil society and foster more\npropoor development. The gender impacts of the program are detailed in Appendix 9.\n\nA. \n\nProgram Risks\n\n133. A basic assumption in the formulation of the GRP is that government and in particular a\nfew central position holders are prepared to introduce and implement major changes in the way\nthe  civil  service  as  a  whole  is  led,  motivated,  and  evaluated,  in  an  environment  of  reduced\ncorruption. In turn, it is also assumed that improvements in these important factors will underpin\nthe likelihood of improved performance in key areas of implementation and service delivery. A\nkey  to  the  success  of  the  reforms  will  be  to  further  develop  and  sustain  broad  political  and\nbureaucratic commitment to the reforms at the central and local levels. However, it is clear that\nthere  are  several  risks  in  embarking  on  a  governance  reform  program  in  Nepal.  The  risks\ninclude changing commitment by the Government and individuals; resistance of politicians, civil\nservants, and others; and risks because of weak institutional capacity.\n\n134.\nThe  political  risks  caused  by  continued  political  instability,  frequent  changes  in  the\ncomposition of the cabinet and leadership, and insurgency are addressed by the GRP in several\nways. All political parties have been involved in discussions regarding the scope of the GRP, will\ncontinue  to  be  briefed  by  the  Government,  and  have  indicated  a  strong  commitment  to  and\nprioritization  of  the  reform  program,  primarily  because  they  realize  that  the  governance\nenvironment  in  Nepal  must  be  improved  to  address  pressing  poverty  and  insurgency  issues.\nKey  advocates  of  governance  reform  are  influential  members  of  cabinet.  Advocates  of  reform\nare  also  found  in  strategic  leadership  positions  in  the  bureaucracy.  Efforts  will  be  made  to\ndeepen  the  commitment  of  existing  reform  advocates,  and  broaden  the  reform  constituency.\nThe program is designed to mitigate the risk of reduced political and bureaucratic commitment\n\n\f34\n\nto  the  reform  program  by  (i)  using  three  tranches  over  three  years  to  ensure  that  government\ncommitment  is  sustained  and  demonstrated  over  the  medium  term;  (ii)  providing  performance\nincentive  funds  to  motivate  participating  ministries  to  implement  the  reforms;  (iii)  actively\nengaging civil society in the program as advocates of the reforms to maintain pressure on the\nGovernment  to  implement  the  GRP,  to  involve  citizens  in  demanding  reforms,  and  to  monitor\nimplementation; (iv) strengthening anticorruption agencies and citizen involvement in identifying\ncorruption cases; and (v) providing TA to strengthen institutional capacity.\n\n135. Beyond  the  issue  of  political  will  to  sustain  commitment  to  and  implement  the  needed\nchanges  is  the  question  of  technical  skills  in  areas  that  are  new  to  government  employees.\nPerformance  improvement  plans;  service  delivery  concepts;  and  issues  of  devolution,\ncommercialization,  and  contracting  out  to  the  private  sector  are  not  the  normal  areas  of\nknowledge  and  competency  within  a  government  bureaucracy.  While  steps  will  be  taken  to\novercome  the  newness  of  the  concepts  and  increase  acceptance  through  various  training\nprograms, mentoring, and implementation of the TA, close monitoring will be needed to assess\nhow well the concerned civil servants cope with these features of the program. There is also a\nrisk  that  the  public  may  resist  the  provision  of  services  by  the  private  sector.  Regular\ncommunication with civil society to build awareness and obtain feedback under TA package 2\nshould help mitigate this risk.\n\n136. Any change in the existing situation is likely to cause some individuals or groups to lose\nprivileged  positions  or  benefits,  while  many  of  the  winners  are  likely  to  be  outside  the\nbureaucracy  and  hence  not  directly  able  to  counter  negative  forces  that  are  likely  to  arise.\nHowever,  the  program  has  attempted  to  mitigate  this  particular  risk  through  an  innovative\napproach  to  citizen  and  civil  society  advocacy  and  involvement,  with  a  further  feature  that\nprovides  for  independent  assessment  and  reporting  on  program  planning,  processes,  and\nresults  by  an  independent  organization  or  individual  under  TA  package  3.  In  addition,\nintroduction, implementation, and enforcement of new procedures will curb negative responses.\nThe performance incentive fund will also motivate civil servants to support the program.\n\n137.\nThe government bureaucracy is to an extent managed by an elite group, which makes\nlittle distinction between personal and public resources. Therefore, there is the risk that public\ninterests  may  be  sacrificed  to  retain  control  over  access  to  power  and  authority,  jeopardizing\nopportunities  for  institutional  reform.  To  address  this  risk,  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  three\ntranches  over  a  three-year  period.  Compliance  with  tranche  conditions  and  related  milestones\nwill  be  required  for  tranche  release.  This  will  allow  constant  monitoring  of  the  Government\u2019s\nongoing  and  continued  commitment  to  the  GRP  by  the  GRCU,  ADB  headquarters  staff,  the\nNRM senior governance and capacity building officer, and the independent program monitoring\nconsultant provided under TA Package 3. New champions of the GRP will constantly be sought,\nparticularly if old champions move to other positions or retire, while existing champions will be\nsupported and strengthened. The performance incentive fund also provides strong motivation to\ncontinue support for the reforms.\n\n138.\nThe  Government  delivery  system  may  fail  to  ensure  equitable  outcomes  for  women\nbecause of its insensitivity and inability to mainstream gender and development issues, leaving\ngender hierarchies intact.  The gender desk at MOGA will develop linkages among senior policy\nmakers and program administrators for enhanced policy and program coordination on gender-\nspecific  activities.  Outputs  that  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  civil  service  positions  are  also\nincluded as tranche release conditions.\n\n\f35\n\n139. While the Government and ADB will make every effort to secure bilateral cofinancing for\nthe  required  TA  for  the  GRP,  there  is  a  risk  that  such  cofinancing  may  not  be  forthcoming,\ndespite  positive  indications  from  DFID,  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,\nDANIDA,  and  SDC.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  consider\nfunding  the  TA  as  required  from  their  own  resources  in  the  event  that  cofinancing  is  not\navailable.\n\nIX.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n140.\nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n (i) \n\n (i) \n\n (i) \n\n (i) \n\n (i) \n\n (i) \n\nPolicies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as\ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter,  will  continue  in  effect  for  the\nduration of the GRP period.\n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and  take  the  other\nactions  included  in  the  GRP  as  specified  in  the  development  policy  letter  and\nwill ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of\nthe GRP period.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funds  are  made\navailable  to  meet  all  financial  requirements  associated  with  implementation  of\nthe  GRP,  including  those  for  addressing  the  social  dimensions  of  civil  service\nreform.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  change  units  in  all  the  pilot  ministries\n(GRCU in MOGA; the Efficiency Unit in MOF; and the change units in MOAC,\nMOES,  and  MOH)  are  adequately  staffed  and  provided  with  the  necessary\nfinancial, technical, and other resources, including equipment, to perform their\nfunctions under the GRP.\n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other\nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the  GRP\nimplementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any\nresulting policy proposals. The Government will take ADB\u2019s views into account\nbefore finalizing and implementing any such proposals.\n\nThe  Government  will  take  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures  to\nmainstream gender and increase the percentage of women civil servants.\n\nX.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n141.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  23,484,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Governance  Reform\nProgram,  with  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest\ncharge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those\nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n2

Limited to lower level\nnon-gazetted staff, about 2,600\napplications were received and\n2,550 approved.  The target is to\nvoluntarily retire a total of 10,000\nstaff over three years.  The\npositions of those so retired will be\neliminated. Savings are estimated\nat NRe100,000/ employee.\n\nSource: The Department for\nInternational Development\nAssistance (DFID) has\nseparately agreed with\nGovernment to provide $15\nmillion to cover the cost of\n3,000-5,000 retirees in\nFY2001 and FY2002\n(included in the above costs).\n\nApprove Policies and\nPlans for Rightsizing\nGovernment\n\nAttrition:  About 1,100 positions\nwill be vacated and abolished\nunder the reform program.\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $1.5 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $10 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $6 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $26 million\n\nContracting Out: Current Civil\nService Act provisions prevent\ncontracting out of normal positions.\nAbout 12,000 positions have been\nidentified as eligible. If half this\nnumber are contracted out under\nthe reform program, it would yield\n6,000 times the average annual\npayroll cost of NRe100,000/\nemployee, to be offset against the\ncontract amount of about 50\npercent of this amount.\n\nDecentralization: Implementation\nof the Government\u2019s\ndecentralization plans should save\nabout 3,000 positions times the\naverage annual payroll cost of\nR100,000/employee.\n\nTemporary Contract Positions:\nAbout 10,000 temporary positions\nare financed out of the annual\ndevelopment budget.  Improvement\nin the management, administration,\nmonitoring, and control of these\npositions could yield savings of 10\npercent, or 1,000 positions, an\naverage annual savings in payroll\nof NRe100,000/employee.\n\nPay Policy Changes: After a\nreview of salary structures and pay\npolicy, salary increases to provide\ncivil servants with competitive\nwages could lead to substantial\nsalary increases, which are here\nassumed to be a modest 3 percent\n($9.4 million) annually, which would\nuse the estimated savings in the\nfirst phase of the reform program.\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $6 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $26 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $2 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $8.5 million\n\nCost: $37.7 million\nSavings: $0 million\n\nCost: $37.7 million\nSavings: $0 million\n\n\fPolicy Measure\n\nDescription\n\nIntroduce\nPerformance\nManagement System\nand Improved Service\nStandards\n\n58\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nPhase I Budgetary Impact\n(Years 1-4)\n\nLonger Term Budgetary\nImpact (Years 5-8)\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $7.5 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $33 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $66.7 million\n\nCost: $0\nSavings: $131.2 million\n\nPerformance Improvements \u2013\nInstitutional: Administrative\nimprovements will be made with\nrespect to procurement and\ncontract management systems.\nAssume a 5 percent improvement\nwill be made in negotiations,\nmanagement, and prevention of\nleakages.\n\nImplementation of Medium Term\nExpenditure Management\nFramework: Medium term\nexpenditure framework or\nperformance-based budgeting will\nresult in better control and\ndecision-making over the annual\nbudget of Ministry of Agriculture\nand Cooperatives (MOAC), Ministry\nof Education and Sports (MOES),\nMinistry of Health (MOH), Ministry\nof General Administration (MOGA),\nand Ministry of Finance (MOF) of\nNRe25 billion ($333 million),\nassuming a 5 percent savings will\nbe achieved through lower budget\namounts and slowdown or cap on\nthe rate of annual increase in the\nbudget.\n\nProgram Unit Staff Costs\n(Governance Reform\nCoordination Unit, Efficiency\nUnit, Change Units) \u2013 Additional\nExpenditures: Assumes a 36-\nmonth program management\nperiod\n\nComputer Hardware/\nPersonnel and Payroll Systems:\nAssumes a 36-month program\nmanagement period\n\nPerformance Improvement Fund:\nAssumes three ministries (MOAC,\nMOES, and MOH) have access to\nthis Fund\n\nNew Induction Courses and\nSpecialized Training Associated\nwith Program Implementation:\nAssumes 5,000 people are either\ntrained or retrained; costs include\nsalaries, per diem, additional\ncollege costs\n\nPublic Awareness Campaign for\nCommission for the\nInvestigation of Abuse of\nAuthority\n\nProgram Management\n\nCost: $60,000\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $60,000\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $15,000\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $5,000\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $1.5 million\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $5.0 million\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $2 million\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $3.0 million\nSavings: $0\n\nCost: $25,000\nSavings: $0\n\n$104.1 million\n\n$104.1 million\n\n$0 million\n\nCost: $25,000\nSavings: $0\n\n$45.8 million\n\n$243.9 million\n\n$198.1 million\n\nReduce Corruption in\nGovernment\n\nTotal Costs\n\nTotal Savings\n\nNet Savings/(Costs)\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND TERMS OF REFERENCE\nFOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nA.\n\nOverall Approach to the Consultancy\n\n1.\nThe  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  build  upon  the  Government\u2019s\nimproving  ability  to  lead,  coordinate  and  implement  its  chosen  long-term  governance  reform\nprogram. Under TA 36221 the Government is receiving 100 person-months of TA to begin the\nprocess of building the reform program over the first 12 months of this four-year program, until\nOctober 2002. The proposed TA packages will provide supplemental assistance starting in year\none (early 2002) of the program (Packages 2 and 3) and new assistance for years two through\nfour (Package 1, beginning in November 2002), building on what is expected to be completed\nwithin  the  first  year  by  adding  resources  for  new  initiatives  as  the  program  develops  in  later\nyears.\n\n2.\nThe overall approach will be to assist the Government\u2019s own staff to plan, implement and\nmonitor  the  agreed  upon  reform  program.  The  Government  has  already  established  change\nunits  in  the  key  ministries\u2014Finance  (MOF),  General  Administration  (MOGA),  Agriculture  and\nCooperatives (MOAC), Education and Sports (MOES), and Health (MOH).\n\nThe skills and working style of the international and domestic consultants will need to be\n3.\nappropriate to the objectives of the assignment, providing support to the staff. While consultants\nwill need to have technical competence in their respective areas, it will be important that they do\nnot  undertake  the  work  for  the  civil  servants,  but  rather  act  as  mentors  and  facilitators  in  the\nvarious areas to be covered. The consultant teams should be gender balanced. The TA will   be\norganized   into   three   separate   packages: (i) Package 1, entitled Core Program Reforms,\nwill  cover  all  five  program  components  (as  contained  in  the  policy  matrix);  (ii)  Package  2  will\ncover  Civil  Society  Support  for  Reform  Measures;  and  (iii)  Package  3  will  cover  Project\nMonitoring.\n\nB. \n\nPackage 1: Core Program Reforms\n\nPackage  1  will  provide  6  international  and  6  domestic  consultants  for  a  total  of  46\n4.\nperson-months of international input and 64 person-months of domestic input. This package of\nassistance  will  provide  inputs  as  described  below.  Each  input  area  is  related  to  a  specific\nprogram objective. This package will continue the work started by TA 3622.\n\n1.\n\nComponent 1: Develop an Internal Capacity for Leading Reform\n\nRationale and Objectives. The Government has recognized that in the past it had no\n5.\ncentral focal point for managing a process of crosscutting governance reforms. As such it has\ncreated a number of focal points so that needed reforms have (i) a central strategic focus\u2014the\nAdministrative Reforms Coordination and Monitoring Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister;\n(ii)  a  central  planning  and  monitoring  focus  across  government\u2014the  executive  committee  of\nsecretaries,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  general  administration,  and  implementation  units  at  the\ncenter; (iii) the Efficiency Unit in MOF;  (iv) the Governance Reform Coordination Unit (GRCU)\nin MOGA; plus (v) change units  in the three affected line ministries\u2014MOAC, MOES, and MOH.\nThe  proposed  TA  aims  to  provide  managerial  and  facilitation  support  to  these  groups  to\n\n1 TA 3622-NEP: Institutional Support for Governance Reforms, for $1,525,000, approved on 18 January 2001.\n\n                  \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nexercise \nimplementation actions.\n\ntheir  new \n\nterms  of  reference \n\nin  undertaking  needed  policy  decisions  and\n\n6.\nScope and Range of Services. The TA will fund an international change management\nand  management  development  specialist  for  18  person-months  who  will  also  be  the  team\nleader,  supported  by  a  domestic  consultant  for  24  person-months,  over  a  three-year  period\nstarting  November  2002.  The  change  management  and  management  development  specialist\nwill be responsible to the secretary of MOGA and have overall responsibility for facilitating the\nwork  of  the  key  committees  and  the  five  change  units  mentioned  in  para.  5,  developing\nleadership and change skills of committee and change unit members, building confidence, and\nsupporting  preparation  of  draft  policies  and  action  plans  by  the  respective  committees  and\nchange  units.  The  change  management  and  management  development  specialist  will  also\nprovide input into the design and presentation of leadership courses to be run for the staff of the\nchange units in MOGA, MOF, and the line ministries.\n\n2.\n\nComponent 2: Improve the Efficiency of the Civil Service\n\n7.\nRationale  and  Objectives. Over  past  years  the  number  of  civil  servants  and  teachers\nemployed has increased beyond the ability of the budget to cope, thus reducing the amount of\nfunds  available  for  required  operation  and  maintenance  needed  to  make  them  productive  in\nproviding  services  to  the  populace.  The  planned  efficiency  initiatives  involve  a  number  of\ntechnical  and  administrative  areas,  such  as  payroll  monitoring,  development  of  computerized\nsystems  for  personnel  management,  and  auditing  of  numbers  and  payments  where  current\nskills  and  confidence  levels  among  civil  servants  to  undertake  these  actions  are  low.  The  TA\naims  to  support  the  various  change  units  at  the  center  and  in  the  line  ministries  to  review  the\ncurrent problems in these areas and help them to devise and implement appropriate solutions to\nimprove  systems  and  procedures  that  will  deliver  savings  and  better  impact  for  resources\napplied.\n\n8.\nScope and Range of Services. The TA will support the areas mentioned in para. 7, and\nwill  be  implemented  by  the  various  units  at  the  center  and  in  affected  line  ministries.  An\ninternational  and  domestic  devolution  specialist  will  work  six  and  eight  person-months\nrespectively,  and  an  international  and  domestic  payroll  specialist  will  provide  five  and  six\nperson-months of inputs respectively for this aspect of the TA.\n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Improve Governance and Reduce Corruption in Government\n\n9.\nRationale and Objectives.  The Government is making the reduction of corruption one\nof its key priorities. It has prepared legislation that will require asset declaration from politicians\nand  gazetted  civil  servants,  strengthen  the  Commission  for  the  Investigation  of  Abuse  of\nAuthority  (CIAA),  and  establish  special  courts.  The  Government  intends  to  adopt  additional\nanticorruption legislation such as those on whistleblower protection, and antimoney laundering.\n\nScope and Range of Services.  An international and a domestic consultant will provide\n10.\nfour and six months of assistance respectively between November 2002 and the end of 2004.\nThe  consultants  will  report  to  the  chief  commissioner  of  CIAA  and  liaise  with  the  secretary  of\nMOGA  with  the  following  key  tasks:  (i)  provide  support  to  draft  new  anticorruption  legislation\nsuch as on antimoney laundering and whistleblower protection, (ii) advise the government on a\ncomprehensive legal program for its anticorruption initiatives, and (iii) provide training to the staff\nof CIAA and other organizations involved in ensuring compliance with anticorruption legislation.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\n4.\n\nComponent 4: Enhance the Competence and Motivation of Civil Servants\n\n11.\nRationale  and  Objectives.  The  Government  has  identified  a  number  of  areas  that\ndirectly affect the competence and motivation levels of staff, including issues of remuneration,\nprinciples  for  hiring,  promotion,  discipline,  and  lack  of  specialized  training.  Under  the  ongoing\nTA  3622  the  areas  of  remuneration,  human  resources  policies  for  hiring,  promotion,  and\ngrievance,  are  already  being  addressed.  However,  the  issue  of  specialized  training  and  the\nneed for a reformulation of the induction courses and courses for gazetted officers remain. As\nwell, gender imbalance needs to be more comprehensively addressed as a crosscutting issue.\nThe  TA  will  support  human  resource  management  processes,  such  as  hiring,  staff  resource\nmanagement techniques, grievance, transfer, and promotion procedures based on merit which\nhave to be addressed. Additionally, annual performance reviews and procedures for succession\nplanning of senior civil servants will be introduced. These are all to be underpinned by further\nrefinements to the pay policy and a new wage scale.\n\n12.\nScope  and  Range  of  Services.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will\nrespectively  provide  three  and  eight  months  of  assistance  from  November  2002  to  the  end  of\n2004,  reporting  to  the  secretary  of  MOGA,  and  also  working  with  management  of  the  Nepal\nAdministrative Staff College and the Public Service Commission. The international and domestic\nconsultants  will  both  have  experience  in  building  institutional  gender  capacity  to  translate\nincreasing  women\u2019s\ngender  concepts \nrepresentation in organizations.\n\nthe  reform  process  and  outputs, \n\nincluding \n\ninto \n\n5.\n\nComponent  5:  Establish  Processes  for  Improving  Performance  in  Key\nMinistries  (MOAC, MOES, MOF, MOGA, and MOH)\n\n13.\nRationale and Objectives. In recent years some sector ministries have made attempts\nto provide better service delivery but these efforts have tended to be fragmented and piecemeal.\nIn keeping with the Government\u2019s overall goal of improving service delivery, three core service\ndelivery ministries will undertake a program of improving their service delivery performance, as\nmonitored against established service standards. Further, in terms of overall performance, this\neffort  is  to  be  leveraged  through  the  creation  of  a  performance  improvement  fund,  whereby\nministries  with  approved  plans  gain  additional  control  over  resources  allocated  under  the\nbudget.  Additionally,  the  two  central  ministries,  MOGA  and  MOF,  need  to  have  their  program\nsupport units\u2014GRCU in MOGA and the Efficiency Unit in MOF\u2014strengthened so their staff can\nprovide guidance to the line ministries under the Program, and also within the wider aspects of\ntheir day-to-day responsibilities.\n\n14.\nScope  and  Range  of  Services.  The  scope  of  this  initiative,  which  will  start  with  MOA\nunder the ongoing TA 3622 contract, and be extended to MOES and MOH during the second to\nfourth years of the program, requires expertise in performance management. The performance\nmanagement specialist, working with other specialists will assess the skill levels and needs of\nline ministry personnel and management in relation to preparation of performance improvement\nplans,  and  will  provide  direction  on  covering  areas  directly  relevant  to  production  of  the  plan.\nThe  services  of  performance  management  specialists    (10  person-months  of  international\nexpertise and 12 person-months of domestic expertise) will be required.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nC. \n\nPackage 2: Civil Society Support for Reform Measures\n(44 person-months of domestic input)\n\nRationale and Objectives. The Government has decided that, to build political and civil\n15.\nsociety support for the Reform Program, it will conduct a widespread communication campaign\nregarding all the major aspects of the Reform Program. Internally this will include civil servants,\npoliticians,  and  the  unions  directly  affected  by  the  scope  of  the  Governance  Reform  Program.\nExternally, it will address civil society and nongovernment organizations. In the communication\neffort, the gender-sensitive aspects of the Program will also be emphasized.  It is intended not\nonly to inform, but also to seek discussion and inputs from civil society as a way of making the\nProgram more transparent and ensuring that where the public are directly concerned\u2014such as\nthe use of services\u2014they have mechanisms for input and feedback on performance.\n\n16.\nScope  and  Range  of  Services.  The  contract  will  cover  two  areas:  (i)  general\ncommunication on the Governance Reform Program to a variety of audiences; and (ii) specific\ncommunication to the public on issues of service delivery standards, including mechanisms for\ninput to the standards and feedback on performance.\n\nD.\n\nPackage 3: Program Monitoring (12 person-months of domestic input)\n\n17.\nRationale and Objectives. The Government has recognized that, as part of its efforts to\nincrease transparency and increase civil society confidence in its efforts for governance reform,\nit will be necessary to utilize the services of a reputable, independent organization or individual\nto  review  the  program,  procedures,  plans,  and  results  achieved,  and  to  have  these  findings\ndistributed  and  discussed  in  the  widest  possible  forums.  The  proposed  TA  will  fund  these\nprogram monitoring services.\n\nScope and Range of Services. Needed inputs are for a program evaluation specialist\n\n18.\n(12 person-months) over the 48-month program period.\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements for the Consulting Services\n\n19.\nThe prime Executing Agency for all proposed TA will be MOGA, in conjunction with MOF\nand  the  three  line  ministries  implementing  the  program  actions.  As  detailed  above,  each\npackage and its component parts will be provided for various periods during the program, and\nwill  be  tailored  to  fit  the  progress  being  made  under  each  element  of  the  overall  Program.  In\ntotal  the  TA  will  require  46  person-months  of  international  input,  as  defined  above,  and  will\nutilize 120 person-months of domestic consulting services, with (i) Package 1 using 46 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  64  person-months  of  domestic,  (ii)  Package  2  using  44  person-\nmonths  of  domestic,  and  (iii)  Package  3  using  12  person-months  domestic  consultant  input.\nTotal  costs  of  the  proposed  TA  packages  are  summarized  in  Table  A6.1,  and  amount  to  $2.4\nmillion,  of  which  about  $2  million  may  be  financed  from  bilateral  aid  agencies,  or  the\nGovernment.\n\n\f 63\n\nAppendix 6, page 5\n\nTable A6.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nItem\n\nA.

The  change  process  is  even  slower  where  human\ndevelopment indicators are low, and consequently the barrier of social stratification is stronger.\nEthnic  minorities  and  caste  groups  are  often  lower  in  the  social  hierarchy,  with  unequal\ndistribution  of  access  to  resources.  Women  also  face  discrimination;  they  have  always  been\nassigned  a  lower  position  than  men  in  every  aspect  of  life.  Various  socioeconomic  indicators\nhave  been  improving  in  Nepal  since  their  collection  was  started  roughly  four  decades  ago.\nHowever, as the country started with very low values for such indicators and progress in most\ncases has been at a relatively low pace, the current situation is characterized by low levels of\nsocioeconomic  indicators  even  by  South  Asian  standards.  Almost  60  percent  of  the  adult\npopulation cannot read or write\u2014almost 80 percent for females and 43 percent for males; less\nthan 30 percent of the population does not have access to safe drinking water; the country has\nthe highest infant mortality rate (75 per thousand in 1999) in South Asia; and about 47 percent\nof children below five years of age are malnourished.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Assessment\n\n2.\nThe first effort to gauge the incidence of poverty was attempted by the National Planning\nCommission  in  1976/77.  The  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey  (1996)1  provides  the  latest\ninformation on the dimensions and characteristic features of poverty. According to the Survey,\nthe poverty line is set at NRe4,404 per person per year,2 based on a food consumption basket\nof 2,124 calories and an allowance for nonfood items of about 35 percent of the cost of the food\nbasket.\n\nPoverty  in  Nepal  is  widespread,  with  42  percent  of  the  population  living  below  the\n3.\npoverty line. This figure does not, however, convey the depth and severity of poverty in Nepal.\nLarge  segments  of  the  poor  are  hardcore  poor,  barely  eking  out  a  subsistence  living  from\nfragile,  vulnerable  ecosystems,  and  large  areas  of  the  country  lack  even  the  most  basic\ninfrastructure, which is reflected by low socioeconomic indicators at the district level. There are\nwide  variations  based  on  the  rural-urban  divide,  geography,  ethnic  group,  and  occupational\ncaste. About 44 percent of rural households and 23 percent of urban households are estimated\nto lie below the poverty line. Given that close to 88 percent of the total population reside in rural\nareas, poverty is much more severe in rural areas. It does not vary much between the hills and\nthe Terai, but is much higher in the mountains.3 The distribution of poverty incidence across the\nfive development regions indicates that the number of households below the poverty line in the\neastern and central development regions is less than those of the other regions.\n\nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact of the Civil Service Reform Program\n\n1.\n\nGeneral Impact\n\n4.\nThe social and poverty importance of governance reforms is analyzed in terms of their\nanticipated impacts upon the labor market, prices of goods and services, service delivery, public\n\n                  \n\n1 Central Bureau of Statistics with support from the World Bank.\n2 This comes to $80 adjusted to inflation and at an exchange rate of $1 to Re70 for FY 2000.\n3 Nepal is divided into three geographic regions, the lowlands (Terai), the middle hills, and the high mountains.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 8, Page 2\n\nsocial  expenditure,  participation  and  empowerment,  and  poverty.  Civil  service  reforms  touch\nupon  major  issues  related  to  reducing  the  size  of  the  bureaucracy,  enhancing  morale  through\nimproved  pay  scale  and  implementation  of  a  merit-based  recruitment  and  promotion  system,\nreducing  corruption  through  the  use  of  transparent  procedures  and  creating  a  framework  for\nprosecuting corrupt politicians and civil servants, and promoting leadership qualities among civil\nservants.  These  measures  are  intended  to  improve  social  sector  service  delivery,  enhance\nresource  allocation  efficiency  and  its  use,  generate  a  greater  sense  of  accountability,  monitor\npublic  and  private  sector  performance  more  effectively,  and  promote  more  transparent  and\nthe\nparticipatory  decision-making.  The  reform  measures  are \nimplementation  of  strategies  to  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  pro-poor,  broad-based\neconomic growth; social sector development; and targeted poverty reduction programs.\n\nthus  meant \n\nfacilitate \n\nto \n\nGovernance reforms are expected to have significant social impacts due to efficiencies\n5.\nin  resource  allocation  and  resource  use.  Human  development  indicators  can  be  significantly\nimproved  if  social  services  in  the  areas  of  basic  and  primary  education,  basic  general  and\nreproductive health services, and safe drinking water can be provided effectively when needed.\nThe  economy's  growth  prospects  will  improve  as  the  reforms  begin  to  stimulate  revenue\ngeneration of the Government, better management of public expenditures, efficient and effective\nimplementation  of  development  projects,  and  closer  regulation  of  private  sector  activities  to\npromote competition. A sustained high growth rate based on successful reform is a precondition\nfor poverty reduction.\n\n2.\n\nImpact on the Labor Market\n\nThe  impact  on  the  labor  market  can  be  expected  in  both  the  number  of  employment\n6.\nopportunities and the quality of the labor force in terms of labor productivity. Reducing both the\nsize  of  the  bureaucracy  and  the  number  of  public  enterprises  will  create  structural\nunemployment. Retrenchment creates possible problems through the impact of voluntary early\nretirement  schemes  on  the  Government's  financial  position,  and  through  early  retirement  of\nmore  efficient  personnel  rather  than  redundant,  inefficient  staff.  Hence,  mass  retrenchment\nshould  be  avoided,  and  personnel  numbers  should  be  gradually  and  selectively  reduced.  To\nretain  valued  personnel,  a  negative  list  may  need  to  be  developed  to  prevent  such  staff  from\nleaving the civil service.\n\n7.\nPay  increases  and  a  merit-based  recruitment  and  promotion  system  will  augment  the\nefficiency of labor. As the pay structure of civil servants is extremely low, such reform measures\nwill  improve  their  economic  status.  The  privatization  of  noncore  functions  will  possibly  create\nunemployment.  However,  since  many  of  the  affected  staff  are  likely  to  be  hired  by  the  private\nsector  to  provide  the  services,  they  will  benefit  from  improved  service  delivery,  and  individual\nemployment will most likely to be positive. For those who are not easily absorbed by the private\nsector, training programs are required to minimize the impact of structural unemployment. Apart\nfrom the direct impact upon employment, indirect effects through better project implementation\nare  also  likely.  Delays  in  project  implementation  of  many  labor-intensive  infrastructure\ndevelopment programs could be expected to diminish and as a result the demand for such labor\nwill be steady and wage income more regular as projects are effectively implemented.\n\n3. \n\nImpact on Prices of Goods and Services\n\n8.\nExperience in the past has shown that pay increases are often accompanied by a rise in\nthe prices of goods and services. This phenomenon was significantly reduced recently with the\nintroduction  of  a  liberal  economic  policy  seeking  to  diversify  sources  of  supply  of  goods  and\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 8, Page 3\n\nservices,  and  making  them  more  competitive.  So  pay  hikes  are  likely  to  have  a  negligible\nnegative impact in terms of price rises.\n\n9.\nThe  privatization  of  noncore  functions  could  raise  the  prices  of  such  services,  as  such\nservices  were  previously  available  at  a  lower  price,  and  at  a  lower  efficiency  level.  However,\nincreased  efficiency  will  gradually  compensate  for  the  increase  in  prices.  It  is  a  general  trend\nworldwide to provide public services either free of cost or at unrealistically low prices. As service\ncharges  are  introduced  or  raised,  prices  of  such  services  are  bound  to  rise.  However,\nconsumers  in  Nepal  have  demonstrated  in  many  sectors  that  they  are  willing  to  pay  if  they\nreceive better services on a sustained basis. To minimize the impact of such price increases on\nthe poorer income groups, prices can be increased at a differential rate\u2014higher rates for higher\nlevel of consumption of the goods and services under consideration.\n\n10.\nThe reform measures could also lead to better delivery of economic services by some of\nthe  public  enterprises,  resulting  in  price  stabilization  efforts  as  more  efficient  operations  are\nachieved. At the moment, prices are raised on a regular basis to meet the interest on costs and\nother leakages. Such services include electricity, communications, and water supply.\n\n4. \n\nImpact on Service Delivery\n\nA significant impact can be expected upon service delivery in terms of the timeliness and\n11.\nquality of service delivery. Despite the availability of physical facilities even in remote areas of\nthe country, these services are often very poor. Hence, any incentive to civil servants to deliver\nservices more effectively and efficiently through these service outlets will lead to an increase in\nhuman development indicators like literacy rate, infant and child mortality rates, and so on. They\nwill also help lower the maternal mortality rate and improve life expectancy levels. As the poorer\npeople mostly consume these public services, any efficiency gain in service delivery will directly\nbenefit  the  poor.  For  goods  and  services  provided  only  by  the  public  sector,  differential  price\npolicies are needed to protect the poorer groups.\n\n5.\n\nImpact on Public Social Expenditure\n\nCivil  service  reforms  by  themselves  will  not  have  much  impact  on  social  public\n12.\nexpenditure. In the context of the 20/20 compact,4 the Government is trying to increase public\nexpenditure for social priority sectors to the desired level. However, since there is evidence of\nallocated resources not being spent, increasing social public expenditure would be difficult, if not\nimpossible. In this context, the reform measures can contribute to better management of public\nexpenditure, and in the process the impact of these social priority programs will be enhanced.\n\n6.\n\nImpact on Participation and Empowerment\n\nThe  other  significant  expected \n\n13.\nis  on  participation  and\nimpact  of \nempowerment. There are different aspects of this possible impact. The Local Self-Governance\nAct has established the framework for active participation of local government bodies, and any\nreform  measures  now  have  the  potential  of  engaging  all  local  government  bodies  more\nproductively.  However,  due  to  weak  institutional  capacity,  the  local  government  bodies  by\nthemselves  will  not  be  able  to  take  up  the  responsibilities.  They  can  be  expected  to  play  a\ngreater role in the management and financing of primary schools and health services centers if\ncapacity-building assistance is provided to them.\n\nthe  reforms \n\n4 Agreed at the World Summit for Social Development, 6-12 March 1995 in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\n                  \n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 8, Page 4\n\n14.\nLikewise, the governance reforms could result in greater participation and empowerment\nof socially excluded groups and women through capability-building measures, such as support\nfor courses to prepare targeted people to appear in the civil service and similar examinations.\nSimilar courses could be developed for the purpose of promotion. One other measure could be\nto  make  candidates  from such targeted groups eligible to join the civil service once they pass\nthe written examination.\n\n7. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n15.\nThe  governance  reform  measures  will  have  significant  impact  upon  poverty  reduction.\nThe  Government  is  the  main  service  provider  to  poorer  people.  So  any  efficiency  gain  in\nproviding  services  in  basic  education,  basic  health  services,  and  increasing  access  to  safe\ndrinking  water  will  reduce  poverty.  They  will  also  boost  labor  productivity,  providing  a  positive\nimpact  upon  incomes  as  well.  Improving  the  quality  of  the  services  should  be  viewed  as  a\nmitigation measure to possible price increases or high prices of private sector service providers.\n\n16.\nThe  services  provided  by  the  private  sector  usually  do  not  reach  the  poor  people,  but\nthey  have  the  potential  of  releasing  government  resources  to  focus  on  specific  target  groups.\nMoreover, private sector involvement in providing services helps expand the number of jobs and\nin  the  process  create  employment  opportunities.  Enhancement  in  the  efficiency  of  public\nexpenditure management is expected to improve the absorption capacity of the social sector. It\nwill  facilitate  further  allocation  of  public  resources  on  these  sectors  and  make  these  services\navailable to targeted groups and areas.\n\n17.\nReducing implementation delays in infrastructure development programs will lessen the\nfluctuation in demand for labor and will make wage income more regular. Wage income is one\nof the major nonfarm income sources and is a coping strategy at the time of natural disasters.\nPrivatization of noncore functions of the Government and greater private sector involvement in\nproviding utility services, particularly in the urban areas, are likely to increase the prices of such\ngoods  and  services.  They  will  increase  the  cost  of  living  of  the  urban  poor.  To  minimize  such\nimpacts, services at the community level could be provided at reduced prices.\n\n8.\n\nImpact on Gender Issues\n\n18.\nDownsizing  the  bureaucracy,  reducing  the  size  of  the  teacher  service,  and  transfer  of\nsome  functions  to  local  authorities  could  reduce  the  total  number  of  women  civil  servants,\nalthough  perhaps  not  the  percentage.  However,  women  in  general  are  expected  to  benefit\nsignificantly  by  way  of  efficient  service  delivery,  greater  access \nto  services,  gender\nempowerment,  attempts  to  increase  female  representation  in  the  civil  service,  gender\nsensitization  of  the  civil  service  and  government  policies  and  programs,  and  increased  public\nsocial expenditure.\nAs the number of women civil servants may be reduced, gender auditing\nand  gender  sensitization  of  government  policies  and  programs  are  likely  to  suffer.  To  combat\nthis,  inclusion  of  a  gender  sensitization  component  in  different  training  programs,  and  a\nguideline  to  incorporate  gender  perspectives  could  minimize  such  impact,  which  is  essentially\nshort  term.  A  social  impact  matrix  summarizing  impacts  of  the  reform  program  is  contained  in\nTable A8.1.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 8, Page 5\n\nTable A8.1: Social Impact Matrix\n\nLabor Market\n\nDirect\nSome structural and\ntemporary\nunemployment\n\nIndirect\n\nLarge employment\ngeneration in the\nprivate sector\n\nSocial Impact\n\nService\nProvision\n\nSocial Public\nExpenditure\n\nQuality and efficient\nservice delivery in\neducation, health,\nand drinking water\nprovisions\nHigher allocation of\npublic resources on\nsocial priority sectors\n\nHuman\nDevelopment\n\nPoverty\n\nParticipation\nand\nEmpowerment\n\nGender Issues\n\nImprovement in\nliteracy rate and\nhealth status, and\nreduction in\nwaterborne diseases\n\nSome retrenched low\nlevel staff can face\nhardships.

The adult female literacy rate is\nthe  lowest  in  South  Asia,  and  the  maternal  mortality  rate  is  the  highest.  On  the  other  hand,\nNepal's  agriculture,  particularly  in  the  hills,  depends  largely  on  women.  Women's  share  in  the\nagricultural labor force increased from 45 percent in 1991 to 56 percent in 1999.1 Women are\nalso coming out to work in the industry and service sectors, constituting 31 percent of the non-\nagricultural  labor  force  and  15  percent  of  the  manufacturing  labor  force.  Despite  increasing\ninvolvement in the economy, women\u2019s participation in policy-making at higher levels, and their\nplacement in political, administrative, and managerial positions is very low. Nepal also lags far\nbehind  other  countries  on  many \nthe  gender\ndevelopment  index,  even  within  the  South  Asia  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  region\n(Table A9.1).\n\nindicators  concerning  women, \n\nincluding \n\nTable A9.1: Selected Indicators of Women's Status (1997-1998)\n\nFemale\nLabor Force\n(% of total)\n\nMMR (per\n100,000\nbirths)\n\nGender\nDevelopment\nIndex\n\nWomen\nin Adm.&\nMgt.\n\nFemale\nPopulation\n(% of\ntotal)\n50\n49\n50\n48\n47\n46\n50\n48\n\nCountry\n\nNepal\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\nSouth Asia\n\n42\n41\nna\n32\nna\n29\n36\n33\n\n%\nLiterate\nFemale\nAdults\n25\n27\n30\n39\n96\n25\n88\n37\n\n540\n440\n 1600\n410\n202\n340\n60\n405\n\n0.441\n0.428\n0.444\n0.525\n0.711\n0.472\n0.712\n0.511\n\n  9.1\n  5\nna\n  2\n14\n  4\n18\n  3a\n\nWomen in\nCivil\nService\n(%)\n7.66\n7.88\nna\n6.80\nna\n5.35\n21.1\nna\n\nMMR = Maternal Mortality Rate, na= not available.\na Does not include Nepal.\nSource: Mahbub ul Haq Human Development Center: Human Development in South Asia, 2000.\n\n2.\nGiven  this  situation,  involving  women  in  the  development  process  on  an  equal  footing\nwith men has been an issue of particular concern to the policy-makers in the country since the\nearly 1980s. The Sixth (1980-1985) and subsequent five-year plans have emphasized women's\ninvolvement  in  the  developmental  process  on  a  more  equitable  basis.  Particularly,  after  the\nadvent  of  democracy  in  Nepal  in  1990,  the  five-year  plans  have  emphasized  the  need  for\nincreasing women's access to decision-making levels in all walks of life. But progress has been\nslow  and  the  proportion  of  women  in  senior  decision-making  positions  in  the  civil  service  and\npolitics  has  not  progressed  beyond  tokenism,  except  at  the  lowest  ladder  of  the  political\nhierarchy,  the  ward  committees.  This  exception  at  the  ward  level  was  achieved  by  a  blanket\nreservation of 20 percent of the seats for women.\n\n3.\nIn  light  of  the  slow  progress  in  mainstreaming  women  in  the  national  development\nprocess  and  to  conform  to  the  Beijing  Platform  for  Action  (1995),  in  the  current  Ninth  Plan\n(1997\u20132002)  the  Government  changed  its  approach  to  gender  issues.  Policies  enunciated  in\nthe  Plan  are  divided  under  mainstreaming,  eliminating  gender  inequality,  and  empowerment.\n\n1Central Bureau of Statistics: Population Monograph of Nepal, 1994 and Nepal Labor Force Survey 1998/99, 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 9, page  2\n\nAmong  other  things,  mandatory  representation  of  women  in  the  formulation  of  policies  and\nprograms at all levels and affirmative action have been promised, as empowerment of women\npresupposes the participation of women in the overall governance process of the country.\n\nThe  Constitution  of  Nepal  (1990),  while  embodying  the  principles  of  equality  of  all\n4.\ncitizens,  irrespective  of  their  religion,  race,  sex,  caste,  ethnicity,  etc.,  recognizes  the  specific\nresponsibilities of the state towards the development of women and other disadvantaged groups\n(Article 26.7, 9 and 10). Moreover, the Government has repeatedly committed itself to taking the\nnecessary  measures  to  implement  this  responsibility  in  several  international  conventions  and\ndeclarations, including the Beijing Plan of Action.\n\nB. \n\nWomen in Nepal's Civil Service \u2014 Current Status\n\n5.\nIn  spite  of  numerous  policy  declarations  and  government  commitments,  the  issue  of\nincreasing  female  representation  in  the  civil  service  has  not  received  serious  mainstream\nattention  so  far.  The  administrative  reform  commissions,  which  have  produced  several  reports,\nhave  assumed  the  civil  service  to  be  gender  neutral.  On  the  other  hand,  the  cabinet  has\napproved a Nepal National Strategy (1997) for the implementation of the Beijing Plan of Action,\nwhich  explicitly  specifies  the  need  for  affirmative  action  and  recommends  a  20  percent\nreservation of civil service positions at all levels.\n\n6.\nThe Government has also initiated certain measures to promote women's entry into and\npromotion  through  the  civil  service,  by  including  special  provisions  on  women  in  the  Civil\nService Act (1993). These provisions give women a five-year concession on entry age (35 years\nfor  men  and  40  years  for  women),  a  six-month  advantage  in  the  probation  period  (one  year\nagainst  six  months),  and  a  one-year  advantage  regarding  the  minimum  period  of  service  for\npromotions.  The  act  also  requires  joint  posting  of  spouses  in  the  same  district  if  both  are  in\ngovernment  service.  To  improve  women  candidates'  capacity  to  take  the  Public  Service\nCommission  (PSC)  examinations,  some  preparatory  courses  have  been  organized  since\nDecember 1996 for Class Three level positions in the administrative service on the initiative of\nthe Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare (MOWCSW).\n\nIn the meantime, women's representation in the civil service has continued to remain at\n7.\nless then 9 percent in total, and less then 5 percent at the policy level (Table A9.2).  Moreover,\nthe rate of increase in their proportion has been slow, particularly at the decision-making  level\n(3 percent in 1978, and 5 percent in 2001). A matter of greater concern is the fact that there has\nbeen a decline between 1999 and 2001. The intake of women in the civil service is minimal, and\npromotions  have  been  negligible.  After  the  current  pool  of  first  class  and  second  class  women\nofficers retire in the next 2 \u2013 3 years, this proportion is expected to decline further. For example,\nbetween 1995/96 and 1999/2000, 544 persons were recommended by the PSC for officer level\nintake to the Administrative Service. Only eight of them (1.4 percent) were women. All of them\nwere for the third class level.  Of the 56 recommendations for Class II and I, none was a woman,\ndespite the fact that eight women had taken the examination for Class II and 14 for Class I.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 9, page  3\n\nTable A9.2: Percent Women in the Civil Service (1978-2001)\n\nPositions\nGazetted Officersa\nSpecial and First (Policy Level)\nSecond\nThird\nNongazetted (Support Staff)b\n\n1978\n\n3.23\n1.00\n2.49\n3.66\n2.37\n\n1993\n\n4.39\n2.31\n4.48\n4.54\nna\n\n1999 June\n\n5.16\n4.87\n3.16\n5.24\n8.20\n\n2001\n\n5.12\n4.02\n5.04\n5.34\n8.93\n\nTotal\nna = not available.\na Gazetted class is the officer or professional staff.\nb Nongazetted class is support staff.\nSources: MOWCSW, 2000; MOWCSW: Beijing Plus Five -Country Report, 2001; MOWCSW, unpublished data for 2001; Acharya, M:\nStatistical Profile of Nepalese Women, 1979; Acharya, M.: Gender Equity and Empowerment of Women, 1997, Kathmandu.\n\n7.81\n\n2.62\n\n8.55\n\nna\n\nSimilarly, 120 officers were promoted from Class III to Class II overall in the civil service,\n8.\nbut  none  was  a  woman,  while  among  the  61  persons  promoted  from  Class  II  to  Class  I,  there\nwas only one woman. Further, in April 2001, 17 secretary level positions were filled. No woman\nfigured  in  the  shortlist.  It  seems  that  relatively  few  women  apply  for  entry  to  the  civil  service,\nespecially at higher levels, and even fewer succeed. In the PSC entry examinations for Class III\nofficers for the Administrative Service discussed above, among nearly 57,000 applicants, only 4\npercent  were  women,  despite  the  fact  that  in  1991  women  constituted  about  18  percent  of  the\ngraduate population.\n\nC. \n\nConstraints on Entry and Promotions in PSC\n\n1. \n\nEntry\n\n9.\nIn the last few years several studies have tried to analyze why few women apply for the\nPSC  examinations  and  fewer  succeed.  The  promotion  process  and  the  examination  process\nhave also been analyzed in some detail, with stakeholder involvement.2 Common constraints on\nwomen's  entry  into  and  promotions  in  the  civil  service  that  emerge  from  these  studies  are\nsummarized below.\n\n10.\nSocial Attitudes. Marriage and children are still considered the first priority for women,\neducated  or  not.  This  pressures  families  to  marry  their  daughters  by  the  time  they  are  in  their\nearly twenties. By the time women are ready to take entry examinations, mostly they are married\nand  engaged  in  rearing  children,  which  leaves  little  time  to  prepare  for  the  competitive  PSC\nexaminations for government jobs.  A rearing that prepares girls to accept only a secondary role\nin  public  life  creates  lack  of  confidence  among  women  and  their  family  members  on  their\ncapacity to compete and to succeed in the PSC examination.\n\n11.\nMarket Conditions. The low percentage of female graduates and the tough competition\nin the PSC examinations also result in low female application rates for civil service jobs. Growing\njob  opportunities  in  the  teaching  and  other  nongovernment  sectors  including  the  private  sector\noffer  women  a  better  work  environment  and  facilities.  This  has  resulted  in  a  lack  of  interest  in\n\n                  \n\n2  Adhikary, Women in the Civil Service  1998;  MOWCSW: Gender Dimensions in Civil Service,  2000;  SAHAVAGI,\nEngendering the Nepalese Civil Service with Specific Reference to Entry in Administrative Services and Promotion\nSystem , 2001.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 9, page  4\n\ngovernment  jobs  among  urban  women,  who  have  the  necessary  educational  prerequisites,\nwhereas  their  rural  counterparts  lack  the  required  qualifications.  Parents  who  are  in  the  civil\nservice  also  provide  a  negative  impression  of  the  civil  service,  complaining  about  the  low  pay\nand rampant favoritism and nepotism.\n\n12.\nWork Environment. The work environment in government jobs is not perceived to be\nwoman-friendly. Women government officers complain that their male colleagues and superiors\nunderestimate the capabilities of female staff.  Stagnation of women officers in lower positions for\na  long  time  compared  with  their  male  colleagues  due  to  gender-biased  promotion  criteria  also\ncreates an image problem, even for those women graduates who want to join the public service.\nLack of flexibility in work hours and other facilities such as adequate leave and physical facilities\n(daycare centers, toilets, etc.) discourage women further from joining the civil service.\n\n13.\nPSC Examination System. The PSC examinations, up until the recent past, even when\nrevisions  were  introduced,  were  outdated,  vague,  wide  in  scope,  and  not  favorable  to  fresh\ngraduates.  The  questions,  focused  especially  on  general  knowledge  and  social  studies,  are\nmemory  testing  type  questions,  rather  than  testing  the  capacity  of  the  candidates.  Women\ncandidates have less time to memorize these facts and figures. Further, the requirement to write\nthe  examination  in  Nepali  while  university  education  is  mostly  in  English,  the  practice  of\nallocating  additional  marks  for  higher  divisions  in  academic  qualifications  and  to  additional\ndegrees  at  the  oral  interview  even  after  being  called  for  an  interview,  and  lack  of  examination\ncenters  at  the  regional  level  all  combine  to  discourage  women  from  taking  the  PSC\nexaminations.  All  of  these  constraints  are  applicable  to  male  aspirants  from  rural  areas  and\ndisadvantaged  groups  as  well,  but  they  hinder  women  more  than  men  because  of  the  social\nconstraints  on  their  mobility  and  their  household  responsibilities.  Lack  of  sufficient  preparation\ntime due to the system of holding examinations immediately after the two important festivals in\nNepal is also a further reason why few women apply for civil service openings.\n\n2. \n\nPromotions\n\n14.\nThe  major  factor  responsible  for  the  lower  promotion  rate  of  women  as  compared  with\nmen  emerging  from  almost  all  stakeholder  surveys  and  studies  is  the  current  marking  system.\nThe  system  of  allocating  more  marks  for  higher  academic  qualifications  (bachelor  versus\nadvanced degrees) and training diplomas has put women in a disadvantageous position because\nfewer  women  have  advanced  degrees.  They  are  unable  to  compete  with  men  on  an  equal\nfooting  in  this  respect  if  they  had  no  master's  level  degree  at  the  time  of  their  entry  into  the\nservice.\n\nD. \n\nLikely Impact of the Governance Reform Program\n\n1. \n\nOverall Impact\n\n15.\nSome  of  the  elements  in  the  reform  program  such  as  reducing  corruption,  limiting  the\nnumber  of  ministries  and  departments,  statutory  boards  and  authorities,  and  the  staff\ndevelopment efforts will benefit women no matter how they are designed. To make them more\ngender  sensitive,  efforts  must  be  made  to  include  the  maximum  possible  number  of  women  in\nthe  institutions  being  considered  and  to  provide  gender  training  to  the  whole  civil  service\nestablishment. Major problems may arise when the issues at stake are \u201crightsizing\u201d and freezing\nrecruitment, and designing procedures for staff evaluation.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 9, page  5\n\n2.\n\nWomen's Representation in the Civil Service\n\n   16.\n\nThe  proportion  of  women  in  decision-making  levels  is  one  of  the  most  important\nindicators  of  their  empowerment.  Their  representation  at  decision-making  levels  in  the  civil\nservice is important not only on equity grounds but also on efficiency grounds. Women constitute\nhalf  of  the  nation,  and  involvement  of  the  stakeholders  in  policies  and  programs  must  include\nthem  for  program  efficiency.  Thus,  increasing  female  representation  in  the  civil  service  is  an\nimportant  intervention  for  female  empowerment  and  equitable  development.  Prioritizing  gender\nissues  in  the  civil  service  implies  simultaneous  interventions  in  three  areas:  (i)  increasing  the\nrepresentation  of  women  in  the  civil  service;  (ii)  reforming  the  acts,  regulations,  rules,  and\nprocesses to facilitate gender-balanced development; and (iii) beginning a process to change the\nattitude  of  those  who  are  in  decision-making  roles.  An  administrative  reform  designed  to\noverhaul  the  whole  system,  with  both  short-  and  long-term  perspectives,  must  be  gender\nresponsive  and  plan  interventions  in  all  three  directions  within  the  framework  of  the  overall\nreform.\n\nThe  freezing  of  recruitment  will  close  all  entry  possibilities  for  women.  Rightsizing  will\n17.\nalso  mean  a  reduction  in  staff  numbers  and  transfers  of  staff  and  their  functions  to  local\nauthorities.  These  transfers  will  probably  reduce  women's  representation  in  the  civil  service  at\ndecision-making  levels,  as  a  majority  of  women  at  higher  levels  within  the  civil  service  are  in\ntechnical  services  in  the  three  pilot  ministries  (Agriculture  and  Cooperatives,  Education  and\nSports, and Health).\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Mechanisms\n\n18.\nThe  administrative  reforms  coordination  and  monitoring  committee  and  executive\ncommittee  should  include  the  minister  of  MWCSW  and  the  secretary  of  MOWCSW  to  provide\ncontinuous gender input to the reform program. Similarly, a gender focal point should be included\nin  the  Governance  Reform  Coordination  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Genral  Administration,  and  the\nEfficiency Unit in the Ministry of Finance.\n\n19.\nTerms  of  reference  for  the  management  teams  in  ministries  and  departments  to  be\ncreated  to  manage  and  implement  reform  must  provide  for  gender  focal  points.  These  teams\nshould also include representatives of women's units in departments and ministries where they\nexist. Consultations with internal stakeholders on reforms must include women's representatives.\n\nF. \n\nMonitoring Arrangements\n\n20.\nAll  monitoring  mechanisms  designed  under  the  reform    program    should    contain\ngender-disaggregated  information  and  gender  impact  analysis.  MOWCSW  should  create  a  unit\nfor monitoring the governance reform program or assign specific responsibility to an existing unit.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of  29 October 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nNRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "=\n=\n=\n", "Nepalese Rupee/s (NRe/NRs)\n$0.013105\nNRe76.304\n", "The  Nepalese  rupee  is  pegged  to  the  Indian  rupee  (Re)  at  NRe1.60  to  Re1.00\nand is fully convertible on all current account transactions.\n", "ADB\nARCMC\nCIAA\nDANIDA\nDFID\nEA\nGDP\nGRCU\nGRP\nIMF\nMOAC\nMOES\nMOF\nMOGA\nMOH\nMOWCSW\nNGO\nNRM\nPPAR\nPSC\nSDC\nTA\nUNDP\nVERS\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nAdministrative Reforms Coordination and Monitoring Committee\nCommission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority\nDanish International Development Assistance\nDepartment for International Development, United Kingdom\nexecuting agency\ngross domestic product\nGovernance Reform Coordination Unit, MOGA\nGovernance Reform Program\nInternational Monetary Fund\nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives\nMinistry of Education and Sports\nMinistry of Finance\nMinistry of General Administration\nMinistry of Health\nMinistry of Women, Children and Social Welfare\nnongovernment organization\nNepal Resident Mission\nProgram Performance Audit Report\nPublic Service Commission\nSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperation\ntechnical assistance\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nvoluntary early retirement scheme\n", "-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  15  July.
