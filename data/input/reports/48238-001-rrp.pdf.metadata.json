Since its opening \n2. \nto  the  outside  world,  and following the  progress  of  various  political  and economic  reforms, the \ncountry  has  been  experiencing  rapid  economic  growth,  which  was  estimated  at  7.5%  in  fiscal \nyear  2013  (ended  31  March  2014)  and  is  expected  to  grow  by  7.8%  per  year  in  fiscal  years \n2014  and  2015.2 However,  after  decades  of  international  isolation,  economic  stagnation,  and \nresulting  underinvestment,  Myanmar  has  grossly  underdeveloped  infrastructure  and  run-down \n(or  nonexistent)  facilities,  and  the  country\u2019s  growth  potential  has  not  been  fully  exploited  as  a \nresult. \n \n3. \nIn  particular,  Myanmar  remains  one  of  the  least-connected  countries  in  the  world  in \nterms of telecommunication, transportation, and logistics. In 2012, fixed line penetration stood at \napproximately  1%,  mobile  penetration  at  7%,  and  internet  penetration  at  less  than  1%  of  the \npopulation.3 In  a  country  with  676,000  square  kilometers  of  land  area,  there  are  only  33,000 \nkilometers  of  paved  roads,  which  translates  into  the  road  density  of  less  than  one-fifth  of  the \naverage of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. While the number of vehicles \ngrew  at  a  constant  annual  growth  rate  of  about  18%  during  2004\u20132013,  the  number  of \nregistered vehicles in Myanmar was 3.6 million in 2013, or 70 vehicles per 1,000 people, which \nis  relatively  low  compared  to  Thailand  (250  vehicles  per  1,000  people)  and  Indonesia  (370 \nvehicles  per  1,000  people).  Inland  waterways  in  Myanmar  play  an  important  role  for  freight \ntraffic, with 5 million tons transported along these waterways in 2011 thanks to the established \nnetwork  along  the  Ayeyarwaddy  and  Chidwin  rivers  and  underdeveloped  land  transportation.4 \nHowever,  the  vessels  and  ports  are  old,  resulting  in  an  underutilized  and  malfunctioning \nnetwork. \n  \nBetter  connectivity  infrastructure  contributes  to  sustainable  economic  growth  by \n4. \nfacilitating  access  to  better  economic  opportunities  and  by  improving  the  productivity  of  many \nsectors.5 A  nationwide  mobile  network  would  be  inclusive  since  people  in  remote  areas  would \nhave  access  to  market  information  and  other  opportunities,  which  would  remove  market \ninefficiencies  and  result  in  welfare  benefits  for  them.6 It  is  estimated  that  a  10%  increase  in \nmobile  penetration  would  raise  gross  domestic  product  by  1.2%  (footnote  3). Development  of \ntransport and logistics infrastructure would enable farmers and other producers to broaden their \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014.

Investment  in  connectivity  infrastructure  is  therefore  a  key  factor  in  giving \npeople and goods better access to more opportunities and markets, reducing transportation and \nother transaction costs, promoting domestic and international trade, and attracting investors into \ndiverse  geographic  areas  and  sectors.  Furthermore,  Myanmar  could  potentially  benefit  from  a \n\u201cgreenfield\u201d  advantage  (i.e.,  it  is  unencumbered  by  investments  in  earlier  technologies), \nmeaning it can immediately adopt more cost-effective, sustainable infrastructure. The caveat is \nthat the government lacks the budget and capacity to undertake projects in various connectivity \nsectors  at  once,  which  is  necessary  to  meet  Myanmar\u2019s  enormous  infrastructure  needs. 7 \nTherefore,  the  role  of  the  private  sector  is  crucial  to  successfully  address  the  connectivity \nbottlenecks. \n \nAgainst this backdrop, an increasing number of private sector connectivity infrastructure \n5. \nopportunities  are  emerging,  including  in  telecommunications,  transport,  logistics,  agriculture \nvalue  chain,  and  related  support  infrastructure.  However,  private  sector  financing  for  these \nopportunities remains a major challenge for the following reasons: (i) many of these projects are \neither  too  small  for  complex  project  finance  structuring  in  an  untested  legal  environment  in \nMyanmar, and/or are perceived to be too risky to finance on a standalone basis; (ii) the banking \nsector  and  capital  market  in  Myanmar  are  highly  underdeveloped,  meaning (a)  local  banks  do \nnot have the skills or capacity to finance such projects, and (b) project promoters do not have \naccess  to  alternative  funding  sources;  (iii)  although  Myanmar  is  experiencing  an  influx  of \ninvestors, investments have been concentrated in the oil, gas, and other mineral sectors, as well \nas  light  manufacturing;  and  (iv)  few  international  investors  have  the  necessary  in-depth \nunderstanding  to  structure  and  implement  local  connectivity  infrastructure  projects,  while  most \nlocal investors lack the financial and managerial capacities to undertake such projects. \n \n6. \nYSH  has  been  identified  as  a  sound  partner  to  fill  this  gap.  As  a  Singapore-listed \ncompany focusing on Myanmar and led by Serge Pun, a reputable Myanmar entrepreneur, YSH \nhas  become  a  preferred  business  partner  for  major  multinational  corporations  including \nMitsubishi,  Sumitomo,  Case  New  Holland,  and  Digicel  Group.  Through  its  work  with  various \nrenowned international partners, YSH has emerged as a potential aggregator of the connectivity \nsubprojects,  which  will  also  enable  them  to  diversify  the  risks  of  individual  subprojects.  Since \nlong-term  commercial  debt,  which  is  necessary  to  undertake  such  connectivity  infrastructure \nprojects,  remains  extremely  scarce  in  Myanmar,  YSH  has  requested  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  consider  extending  assistance.  In  addition  to  ADB\u2019s  direct  contribution  through \nfinancing  the  project,  ADB\u2019s  involvement  and  presence  are  expected  to  catalyze  commercial \ndebt funding to both YSH and to individual subprojects. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  will  support  YSH\u2019s  long-term  investments  in  connectivity  infrastructure \n7. \nsubprojects  in  Myanmar  to  advance  inclusion  of  isolated  people,  reduce  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment  gaps,  and  attract  private  investment  into  diverse  geographic  areas  and  sectors. \nDevelopment  of  connectivity  infrastructure  contributes  to  these  objectives  by  (i)  giving  people \nand goods better access to more opportunities and markets, (ii) improving productivity through \nreduction of transport and other transaction costs, and (iii) promoting domestic and international \ntrade. \n \n\n                                                \n7  It is estimated that total investment gaps for infrastructure could be as much as $80 billion from 2014 to 2030.

The  projects  ADB  will  initially  support  are  described  in  Table  1  and  paras,  9\u201311. \nSubsequently, ADB will support further subprojects that meet eligibility criteria as YSH secures \nnew  connectivity  subprojects  in  transportation,  distribution  and  logistics,  agricultural  value \nchains, or international education, in addition to the subprojects mentioned in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Yoma Strategic Holdings\u2019 Connectivity Subprojects \n\nSubproject \nTelecom towers \n\nProject Description \nConstruction and leasing of telecom towers \n\nPartner \nDigicel Group \n\nCold storage logistics   Construction of warehouses, development of \n\nKokubu & Co.

Established in 1992, FMI is a diversified \ncompany  with  a  core  focus  in  property  development  followed  by  automotive,  services  (e.g.,  healthcare), \nbanking,agriculture, retail, and tourism. As a Myanmar public company, FMI has a broad local shareholder base of \nmore  than  6,000.  While  YSH  is  an  international  flagship  company  with  international  shareholders  to  make \ninvestments  in  Myanmar,  FMI  is  a  local  vehicle  of  Serge  Pun  with  local  shareholders.  YSH  often  makes  co-\ninvestments with FMI because of this association. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\n9  As of 10 October 2014. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nreputation  which  has  led  to  YSH\u2019s  business  partnerships  in  Myanmar  with  renowned \nmultinational corporations. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \nYSH  is  led  by  a  team  of  international  management  professionals  and  is  known  for  its \n13. \ngood  corporate  governance  systems  and  practices,  including  (i)  a  board  of  directors  with  a \nmajority of independent directors; (ii) a clearly set-out code of conduct; (iii) an audit committee, \nnominating committee, and remuneration committee comprised solely of independent directors; \nand  (iv)  well-established  whistleblower  and  internal  control  systems,  evidenced  by  YSH\u2019s \nranking  in  the  top  5%  of  Singapore  Exchange-listed  companies  in  the  2014  Governance  & \nTransparency Index.10 \n \n14. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB. \n\nAside from Serge Pun, no YSH shareholder owns 10% or more shares.  \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n15. \nSuccessful implementation of the project will contribute to (i) increased domestic trade; \n(ii)  increased  labor  productivity,  because  of  the  increased  share  of  secondary  and  tertiary \nsectors  increase,  which  have  higher  productivity  than  the  primary  sector;  and  (iii)  increased \nforeign direct investment, in Myanmar. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n16. \nThe  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  will  be  improved  connectivity  of  people  and  goods  in \nMyanmar.

In \naddition to compliance with the safeguard requirements for individual subprojects, YSH and the \nproject  companies  under  which  the  specific  connectivity  subprojects  will  be  undertaken  will \nestablish  and  maintain  an  ESMS  to  screen,  assess,  and  address  environmental  and  social \n\n\f7 \n7 \n\n \n\nimpacts and risks meeting the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, including the \nsubmission  and  review  of  safeguards  documents.  The  borrower  is  committed  to  implement \nenvironmental and social safeguards in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement on \nsubprojects funded directly by it or through its subsidiaries. \n \n27. \nProposed  infrastructure  will  not  be  located  within  the  boundaries  or  traversing \nenvironmentally sensitive areas such as protected areas, wetlands, or historical or cultural site. \nPotential impacts during construction (e.g., noise, soil erosion, air, and water pollution) can be \nmitigated, and are short-term and temporary. Potential residual impacts during operation (e.g., \nvisual;  pollution  of  land  and  water  from  hazardous  materials  and  wastes;  occupational  and \ncommunity health and safety, including electromagnetic exposure) can also be mitigated using \ntested  mitigation  measures.  The  building  of  telecom  towers  and  the  cold  storage  logistics \nfacilities  will  be  carried  out  by  the  project  companies  on  lands  to  be  leased  from  willing \nlandowners  on  a  long-term  basis.  The  site  selection  criteria  and  processes  by  the  project \ncompanies exclude sites with landowners who are not willing to enter into leases or lands with \npotential  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples are not  envisaged  with  respect to  the  building  of  telecom towers  and cold \nstorage  facilities.  For  government  lands  allotted  for  locating  facilities,  YSH  and  the  project \ncompanies will assess and address any compliance gaps pertaining to involuntary resettlement \nimpacts  in  line  with  ESMS  provisions  and  ADB  requirements.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultations will be carried out in accordance with ADB requirements.15 \n \nA corporate audit was conducted on YSH\u2019s ESMS. The audit identified corrective actions \n28. \nrequired \nto  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. The corrective actions have been discussed and agreed upon with YSH. The key \ncorrective actions include (i) enhancing YSH\u2019s corporate ESMS to meet ADB requirements and \ndeveloping entity-level environmental and social procedures for the three project companies; (ii) \nformalizing  a  procedure  for  screening,  scoping,  and  categorizing  projects  and  undertaking \nappropriate  environmental  and  social  assessment;  (iii)  developing  stakeholder  engagement \nplans and establishing a grievance redress mechanism for the project companies; (iv) providing \nspecific  occupational  health  and  safety  and  community  health  and  safety  strategies  for  the \nproject  companies;  and  (v)  incorporating  in  the  corporate  ESMS  a  policy  statement  and \nprocedures  for  addressing  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  YSH \ncommits to  have a Safeguard  Policy  Statement-compliant  ESMS  that  is satisfactory to ADB  in \nplace  prior  to  the  first  disbursement.  YSH  will  submit  annual  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring  reports  on  the  implementation  of  its  ESMS  and  the  subprojects,  including  the \nimplementation of corrective actions in the audit report. In addition, safeguard documents for the \nsubprojects  in  line  with  the  ESMS  requirements  will  be  prepared  for  the  connectivity \ninfrastructure subprojects to be taken up. \n \nThe project is classified as having some gender elements, and the borrower commits to \n29. \n(i) prioritizing women for at least 40% of construction-related jobs created, and (ii) hiring at least \n30%  women  employees  for  employment  requirements  in  the  connectivity  subprojects.  In \naddition,  YSH\u2019s  human  resources  policies  promote  equal  opportunities  for  women  and  ensure \nthat the rights of women are protected. YSH will comply with ADB's Social Protection Strategy \nand report regularly to ADB on compliance (including  compliance by contractors) with national \nlabor laws and adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.16 \n \n\nto  ensure  compliance  of \n\nthe  ESMS \n\n                                                \n15 Entity-level environmental and social procedures for the other connectivity sectors, in line with the ESMS of  YSH, \n\nwill be prepared and approved by ADB prior to the second tranche disbursement. \n\n16 ADB. 2003.
