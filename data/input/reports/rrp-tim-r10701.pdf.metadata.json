Consequently, three quarters of the population fled\ntheir homes and most of the country\u2019s infrastructure and public\nbuildings \nthousands  of  private  homes  and\nbusinesses were destroyed. The upheaval was accompanied by\nlooting, burning, and damage to town and village water supplies\nand  sanitation  facilities  throughout  the  country.  In  towns  with\npublic water supply systems, vehicles, pumps, and motors were\nremoved;  water  treatment  plants  damaged;  offices,  stores,  and\nother buildings burned; pipelines, tools, and spare parts stolen;\nstorage  tanks  ruptured;  and  water  sources  impaired.  The\nburning  of  houses  completely  destroyed  water  connections,\nincluding  meters,  and  latrines  and  septic  tanks  were  damaged\nwith  part  of  the  house  structure.  None  of  the  former  water\nsupply  or  sanitation  institutions  remained.  The  ongoing  first\nWater Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project (WSSRP-1),\nwhich  was  approved  on  4  August  2000  and  commenced  on  1\nSeptember  2000,  supports  physical  repair  and  rehabilitation,\nand  establishes  new  institutions  and  systems  for  managing,\noperating,  maintaining,  and  further  developing  urban  and  rural\nwater  supplies  that  are  both  appropriate  and  sustainable.\nWSSRP-1's completion is expected on 30 June 2001.\n\nThe  remaining  challenges  are  significant.  The  capacity  of  the\nWater and Sanitation Service (WSS) to plan, develop, operate,\nand  maintain  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  systems\nrepair  and\nrequires  development  and \nrehabilitation  of  existing  water  supply  systems  in  Dili  and  the\ndistrict  capital  towns  under  the  WSSRP-1  have  commenced,\nWS&S coverage remains below developing country targets and\nservice  coverage  improvement  in  the  whole  of  East  Timor  will\nrequire additional sector activities over the coming years.\n\ntraining.

An  ADB  Mission2  prepared  a  Project  with\nauthorized  UNTAET/ETTA  representatives.  The  agreements  reached  were  confirmed  in  a\nmemorandum  of  understanding.  The  Project  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Joint\nManagement  Arrangements  for  the  Trust  Fund  for  East  Timor.3  The  TFET  does  not  include\nADB's own resources.\n\nA. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Description\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  sector  status  is  summarized  in  the  following\n\n3.\nparagraphs. Additional details are in Appendix 2.\n\n1. \n\nCurrent Status\n\na. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\n4.\nThe  Water  and  Sanitation  Service  (WSS)  of  UNTAET  has  been  established  and  is\noperating. WSS now has staff in all districts, is managing 13 public water supply systems in Dili\nand the other district capitals, and through the first Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation\nProject  (WSSRP-1)  and  other  external  support  has  commenced \nthe  essential  policy\ndevelopment and institutional capacity building required to develop its capacity to deliver WS&S\nservices.  The  strategic  plan  for  WSS  (Appendix  3)  requires  WSS  to  assume  broad\nresponsibilities  for  the  delivery  of  WS&S  services  including  water  policy/water  resource\nmanagement, water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and drainage. Under the pre-independence\nadministration,  these  functions  were  fragmented  across  several  ministries  and  levels  of\ngovernment.\n\n5.\nWSS  is  a  newly  formed  agency,  which  is  just  developing  its  staff,  institutional\ninfrastructure,  policies  and  legislation,  and  operational  and  management  systems.  WSS\nrequires significant capacity building. Sector rehabilitation activities are being undertaken in an\n\n                  \n\n1 The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 March 2001.\n2 The Mission comprised W. Poick, Financial Analyst (Mission Leader), D. Ponzi, Economist (Environment), and M.\n\nPonsonby, ADB Staff Consultant.\n\n3  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000, which provides for the\nProject  to  be  processed  using  summary  procedures  normally  reserved  for  emergency  loan  operations  under\nSection 25 of ADB's Guidelines on Operational Procedures.\n\n\f2\n\nevolving institutional and policy environment and significant resource constraints in all areas of\nWSS. The organization will play a key role in coordinating the wide range of donor activities for\nthe sector, but flexibility in planning and implementation is needed in the developing institutional\nenvironment.\n\nb. \n\nWater Supply\n\n6.\nUnder  the  pre-independence  administration,  the  quality  of  the  public  water  supply\nsystems  was  problematic  with  many  of  them  poorly  planned,  designed,  and  operated.  Typical\ndeficiencies  were  low  service  coverage,  poor  maintenance,  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for\nwater, intermittent supply, inappropriate treatment systems, poor water quality particularly from\nsurface  water  sources  during  the  wet  season,  and  frequent  failure  due  to  flood  and  landslide\ndamage to transmission pipelines. Service coverage4 in the piped systems was low (39 percent\nin  district  capitals  and  29  percent  in  subdistrict  towns).  Private  shallow  wells  were  extensively\nused in the urban areas in Dili and other towns.\n\nVillages  and  rural  areas  not  served  by  the  public  water  supply  systems  had  extensive\n7.\ncommunity-owned  and  -operated  piped  systems.  Some  of  these  received  water  from  public\nsystems  and  others  sourced  water  from  small  springs  or  streams.  Shallow  wells  were  also\nextensively used in villages and rural areas, especially those near the sea or on river plains. It\nwas estimated that 48 percent of the total population of East Timor had access to safe water.5\n\n8.\nA  summary  of  key  impacts  of  the  violence  on  water  supply  follows.  (i)  The  institutions\nresponsible  for  water  supply  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  ceased  to  exist  after  the\nIndonesian withdrawal. While many of the technical and administrative support staff were East\nTimorese,  the  majority  of  the  management  and  professional  staff  of  the  PDAM/BPAMs  (local\ngovernment  water  enterprise/district  water  board)  were  Indonesians  whose  departure  had\nsignificant implications for human resource capacity. Many technical staff from the former water\nenterprises have assisted in the process of restoring supplies. (ii) The institutional infrastructure\nincluding  buildings  and  other  assets,  technical  and  financial  records,  vehicles,  tools,  and\nequipment were either stolen or destroyed. (iii) Consumer connections were generally destroyed\nwith  the  widespread  destruction  of  the  houses  that  they  served.  (iv)  The  large  numbers  of\ndisplaced  persons  that  have  moved  into  the  urban  areas,  particularly  in  Dili,  caused  further\ndamage  and physical damage  to pipes as they attempt to access water supply through  illegal\nconnection.  (v)  Damage  to  major  installations,  such  as  treatment  plants,  was  limited.  Some\nbores  were  destroyed  and  pumps  and/or  electrical  switchboards  removed.  In  some  instances,\nbore  casings  were  filled  with  rocks.  (vi)  Power  supplies  were  damaged,  significantly  affecting\npumped  systems,  especially  in  the  early  period  after  the  Indonesian  withdrawal.  Anecdotal\ninformation  indicates  that  damage  to  rural  supplies  was  not  extensive.  However,  there  were\npockets of damage that showed contamination of sources such as shallow wells.\n\nSince the destruction in September 1999, there has been significant progress with both\n9.\nemergency  system  repairs  and  with  planning \nfor  more  substantial  rehabilitation  and\naugmentation  (paras.  34  to  43).  The  public  water  supplies  in  each  of  the  district  capitals  are\noperating and providing supplies of equivalent or better standard.\n\n                  \n\n4 Service coverage is defined as the percentage of the population receiving water supply services within the service\n\narea of the piped network.\n\n5 UNDP. 1998. Common Country Assessment; DiKesTk. I; Health Profile.\n\n\f3\n\nHowever,  service  coverage  and  the  standards  of  service  delivery  before  September\n10.\n1999 had been poor (48 percent compared with 73 percent in Indonesia as a whole). While the\nemergency phase and subsequent activities have made considerable progress in rehabilitating\nand  repairing  the  immediate  damage  caused  by  the  postconsultation  violence,  significant\ninvestment in additional improvements in both urban and rural water supply systems is needed\nto extend the coverage to an acceptable level and to improve service levels.\n\nc. \n\nSanitation\n\n11.\nSanitation  coverage  before  independence  was  estimated  at  38  percent  (footnote  5).\nDamage  to  sanitation  facilities  occurred  as  houses  were  destroyed.  In  addition,  facilities  to\nmaintain and desludge septic tanks were destroyed. As a consequence, access to higher order\nsanitation systems in the urban areas decreased. The damage to water supplies also impacted\non  water  availability  and  use  for  sanitation.  Anecdotal  evidence  indicates  limited  impact  on\nsanitation systems in rural areas. Some facilities have been implemented, particularly in Dili, to\naccommodate  the  additional  demands  created  by  the  influx  of  UNTAET  and  peacekeeping\nforces (PKF) personnel.\n\n12. While  the  initial  emergency  phase  rehabilitation  activities  focused  on  water  supply,\ndonors  and  NGOs  are  now  expanding  their  activities  to  incorporate  integrated  programs  for\nWS&S,  which  include  community  education  and  hygiene  promotion  aimed  at  improving\nenvironmental  sanitation  through  community  participatory  approaches.  Similar  activities  are\nbeing  undertaken  under  WSSRP-1  through  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  Dili  and\nseveral district towns.\n\nd. \n\nSolid Waste\n\n13.\nBefore  independence,  most  towns  had  a  solid  waste  collection  system  in  which  waste\nwas  deposited  in  strategically  located  collection  boxes.  The  capacity  of  the  collection  systems\nwas grossly inadequate and wastes were indiscriminately dumped in drains and on roadsides.\nThe  operation  of  solid  waste  disposal  sites  was  questionable.  Significant  quantities  of  waste\nwere  disposed  of  by  burning.  There  was  no  solid  waste  management  system  in  Dili  after  the\nIndonesian withdrawal. Previous systems involved both community and institutional participation\nin solid waste collection, cartage and disposal. But equipment (handcarts and trucks) used for\ncollection  and  transport  were  either  destroyed,  diverted  to  other  uses,  or  removed.  The\nprovincial sanitation office (Dinas Kebersihan) within the former Dili city administration no longer\nexists. Markets were destroyed, and solid waste is generated from informal markets that have\nestablished on roadsides. The equipment previously used in the solid waste collection systems\nin  other  district  towns  was  either  destroyed  or  removed.  The  community  and  institutional\nsystems for collection and disposal are no longer operating.\n\n14.\nThe large expatriate presence has a significant impact on the generation of solid waste\u2013\nbottled water containers, soft drinks and beer cans\u2013and a general increase in the importation of\nconsumer goods. These problems are particularly apparent in Dili. The general destruction has\ncreated significant additional quantities of solid waste including building rubble, roofing material,\ncar bodies etc. Much of this still litters Dili streets for lack of capacity to collect and dispose of it.\n\n15.\nInitial  solid  waste  management  activities  were  undertaken  through  the  Community\nEmpowerment  and  Local  Governance  Project  (CEP)  and  other  programs  mainly  in  Dili.\nWSSRP-1  provides  support  in  critical  areas  such  as  markets  and  in  the  cleanup  of  large\nquantities of waste generated by the postconsultation destruction. Portugal has funded studies\n\n\f4\n\non  solid  waste  management  in  Dili  and  the  districts,  but  does  not  propose  to  fund  the\nimplementation of recommended proposals.\n\ne. \n\nDrainage\n\n16.\nExcept  in Dili, the drainage  systems in most towns comprise a network of minor street\ndrains and are not of major significance. In problem areas, the drains are smelly because of the\ndischarge of septic tank effluent and/or gray water, exacerbated by solid waste deposited in the\ndrains and lack of regular maintenance. Occasional flooding occurs during the wet season. Dili\nhas  a  major  drainage  system  constructed  originally  during  the  Portuguese  period  and\nsubsequently extended during the Indonesian period. The system has been poorly maintained\nand  badly  neglected  for  many  years.  Deficiencies  include  poorly  designed  and  poorly\nconstructed  drains  (frequently  lacks  level  control),  significant  solid  waste  and  silt  deposition\nreducing  drain  cross-section,  broken  roadside  entry  pits,  and  broken  or  missing  drain  covers.\nThe drains provide breeding grounds for vermin and insects and are a significant health hazard.\nLack  of  maintenance  combined  with  poor  design  and  construction  causes  flooding  during  the\nwet season. A master plan for Dili drainage was prepared in 1995 but was not implemented.\n\n17.\nThe drainage systems sustained no obvious damage during the violence, but they had\ngradually  deteriorated  even  before  the  Indonesian  withdrawal  because  of  lack  of  maintenance\nand increasing use of the drains as receiving areas for solid waste including building rubble. No\nmajor  systematic  work  has  been  undertaken  on  Dili  drainage.  Disposing  solid  waste  including\ngeneral garbage and building waste into drains continues, reducing the capacity of the drains to\nhandle flood flows. Sediment deposition and agricultural activities in some major drains are also\nof concern.\n\n2. \n\nMedium- to Long-Term Sector Development\n\nSince  the  postconsultation  violence,  investment  in  the  WS&S  sector  has  been\n18.\nsignificant.  Basic  services  have  been  restored  to  standards  similar  to  those  during  the\nIndonesian administration. Nevertheless substantial rehabilitation investment is still required and\ncapacity  building  is  needed.  Donor  interest  in  the  sector  is  high.  WSSRP-1  has  significantly\ncontributed to overall sector development.\n\n19.\n\nThe development context may be summarized as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nThe emergency phase is over.\nIt is time for proper planning and implementation of proposed sector investments.\nSubstantial rehabilitation remains to be done.\nSubstantial  medium-term  sector  investment  is  required  to  raise  WS&S  services\nto more appropriate levels.\n\n(v)  WSS  has  been  established,  but  it  is  a  new  institution  requiring  substantial\ncapacity building. Capacity building for other stakeholders is also essential.\nQuality and sustainability are priorities for future sector investments.\nAn  integrated  approach  is  required  for  WS&S  implementation  to  deliver  the\nexpected benefits, particularly for the poor.\n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n\fB. \n\nPolicies and Plans\n\n5\n\n20.\nAppendix  3  gives  an  overview  of  the  current  policies  and  plans  of  WSS.  These  are\nbased on a draft strategic plan prepared in March 2000. The plan gives the overarching goal or\nmission statement for WSS:\n\n\"To  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to  such  water  and\nsanitation services as are considered essential for public health, protection of the\nenvironment and for promotion of economic growth.\u201d\n\nTo  achieve  this  mission,  WSS  has  determined  the  following  four  key  areas  of\n\n21.\nresponsibility (in order of priority based on expected immediate health benefit):\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nurban water supply;\ncommunity (i.e. rural) water supply and sanitation;\nurban sanitation (i.e. drainage, wastewater, & solid Waste); and\nwater resources.\n\n22.\nObjectives determined for each of these areas are detailed in the draft strategic plan. To\nachieve the stated objectives, an organization/staffing structure and budget were proposed for\nFY2000/01.  Unfortunately,  the  East  Timor  recurrent  budget  constraints  necessitated  a  budget\nreduction  of  approximately  50  percent,  and  a  staffing  reduction  of  approximately  60  percent.\nThe  budget  constraints,  combined  with  numerous  international  staffing  shortcomings,  have\nallowed WSS to focus only on urban water supply and, to a lesser extent, community WS&S, to\nthis time.\n\n23.\n\nThe status of the WSS staffing recruitment is indicated in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: WSS Staffing Levels\n\nLevela\nApproved 2000-2001 Budget\nChanges arising from Oct Budget review\nApproved staffing plan at this date\nRecruitment in process (CRO)\nRecruitment in process (WSS)\nRecruited\nBudgeted Total Numbers\n\n1\n47\n0\n47\n0\n21\n26\n47\n     CRO  =  Central  Recruitment  Office  of  the  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET),\n\nTotal\n153\n0\n153\n10\n67\n76\n153\n\n3\n30\n0\n30\n4\n11\n15\n30\n\n4\n13\n0\n13\n0\n11\n2\n13\n\n2\n58\n0\n58\n6\n22\n30\n58\n\n5\n4\n0\n4\n0\n1\n3\n4\n\n6\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nWSS = Water and Sanitation Service.\n\n     a These are grading levels for local staff as determined by the UNTAET.\n\n24.\n\nThe WSS organization chart is in Appendix 3.\n\n1. \n\nUrban Water Supply\n\n25. WSS  is  currently  managing  the  O&M  of  urban  water  supplies  in  Dili  and  in  12  district\ncapital main towns. Levels of service are sufficient to achieve basic health objectives, but water\nquality  is,  at  best,  marginal.  The  longer  term  objectives  are  continual  improvement  and  the\nmanagement  of  water  supplies  in  62  townships  (i.e.,  all  district  and  sub-district  main  towns\npreviously supplied with water supply systems by the Indonesian Government).\n\n\f6\n\nThe  achievement  and  sustainability  of  this  ultimate  objective  depend  on  an  increased\n26.\nbudget  (primarily  sourced  from  water-user  charges)  and  local  staffing  allocations.  WSS  is\ncurrently in the planning and resourcing stages for implementing water-user charges.\n\n2. \n\nCommunity (Rural) Water Supply and Sanitation\n\n27.\nSome 70 percent of the population of East Timor live outside urban areas. Community-\nmanaged  and  operated  small  water  supply  systems  will  allow  this  large  population  to  access\npiped water at minimal cost to East Timor's recurrent budget. Community management usually\nresults  in  a  lower  cost  to  users  of  small  systems,  but  is  usually  accompanied  by  a  lower,  but\nacceptable, level of service.\n\n28. WSS aims to facilitate the provision of adequate, safe, and sustainable water supplies to\nrural  communities.  The  establishment  of  community-managed  water  supplies  is  a  lengthy\nprocess,  requiring  extensive  community  consultation  and  participation  to  ensure  sustainability.\nWSS  has  accessed  substantial  external  resources  to  achieve  this  objective.  Such  funding\nusually also includes small-scale sanitation improvements and environmental health education.\n\n3. \n\nUrban Sanitation (Drainage, Wastewater, and Solid Waste)\n\nSolid  waste  collection  to  date  has  been  undertaken  by  district  administrations  in  an  ad\n29.\nhoc  manner  and  with  variable  success.  More  sustainable  waste  collection  and  safe  disposal\narrangements  are  increasingly  needed.  WSS  has  initiated  discussions  with  Dili  district  to\nimplement such arrangements through the private sector and to encourage waste minimization.\n\n30.\nRecent  heavy  rains  have  highlighted  the  need  for  proactive  activities  in  drainage.\nAlthough flooding is a transitory inconvenience, it does decrease road pavement life and creates\nbreeding sites for disease vectors. Again, there is an increasing need to maintain existing drains\nand undertake drainage improvements.\n\n31.\nEast  Timor's  recurrent  budget  allocations  will  be  required  to  implement  drainage\nmaintenance  and  waste  collection  and  disposal,  although  some  minor  external  funding  has\nbeen  accessed  to  undertake  one-off  activities.  WSS  recently  recruited  an  international  staff\nmember to focus solely on achievement of sustainable urban sanitation arrangements. WSS is\nconfident  such  arrangements  will  be  implemented  within  the  coming  six  months,  providing\nbudget allocations are forthcoming.\n\n4. \n\nWater Resources\n\n32.\nThe  assessment,  responsible  allocation,  and  adequate  protection  of  East  Timor's\nsurface  and  underground  freshwater  supplies  are  vital  to  the  sustainable  provision  of  water\nsupply  at  the  lowest  possible  cost.  To  date,  budget  and  staffing  restrictions  have  prevented\nWSS  from  undertaking  any  significant  activities  in  this  important  area.  External  funds  may\nbecome  available  in  the  future,  but  will  depend  on  East  Timor  identifying  water  resource\nmanagement  as  a  priority  funding  area.  Some  initial  technical  assistance  is  provided  in  the\nproposed project to support WSS in water resource management.\n\n5. \n\nPolicy Development and Institutional Capacity Building\n\n33. WSSRP-1  is  taking a lead role developing the water sector policy by preparing a legal\nand  regulatory  framework  and  legislation,  developing  tariff  policies,  and  preparing  standards\n\n\f7\n\nand  guidelines.  Considerable  capacity  building  is  required  and  is  being  provided  through\nWSSRP-1  and  through  the  Capacity  Building  Project  for  East  Timor  (CAPET)  project  of  the\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID).\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n34.\nSince  the  destruction  of  September  1999,  external  assistance  has  contributed  to\nsignificant  progress  in  both  emergency  system  repairs  and  planning  for  more  substantial\nrehabilitation  and  augmentation.  Appendix  4  lists  the  major  external  assistance  activities  of\nmultilateral agencies, bilateral sources, and NGOs. The major interventions follow.\n\n35.\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  has  completed  the  Study  on  Urgent\nImprovement for Water Supply Systems in East Timor. The study covers 15 towns including Dili.\nAmong  the  towns  are  12  district  capitals  (excluding  Oecusse)  plus  the  townships  of  Ermera\n(Ermera), Maubisse (Ainaro), and Vila/Beloi on Atauro Island. Indications are that JICA will fund\nsystems implementation in 2-5 towns to be selected from Liquica, Lospalos, Ainaro, Suai, and\nMaliana.\n\n36.\nJapan has committed some $11.28 million to the planning, design, and implementation\nof improvements to the urban water supply for Dili. Planning for this phase has been completed\nand  implementation  commenced  in  March  2001.  This  activity  is  funded  by  the  Government  of\nJapan  with  implementation  being  managed  by  the  United  Nations  Office  of  Project  Services\n(UNOPS). WSS and the Japanese Government are currently discussing a refocusing of some\naspects of  the ongoing project. WSS proposed a closer look at the distribution system to fully\nrealize the benefits of the headworks currently planned by the Project. The proposed change in\nscope will increase access to safe drinking water supplies and reduce system leakage.\n\n37.\nAustralia  has  provided  significant  funding  for  emergency  rehabilitation  activities\nundertaken  through  NGOs  including  Oxfam  and  Bia  Hula.  In  addition  it  has  given  substantial\nassistance  to  WSS  through  the  Staffing  Assistance  Program  for  East  Timor  (SAPET)  and  the\nCAPET. Further capacity building assistance totaling $1.5 million is planned during 2001-2003.\nAustralia also plans to provide $8 million for a community/rural WS&S program that will focus on\nthe districts of Kova Lima, Bobonaro, and Viqueque over three years starting September 2001.\n\n38.\nPortugal is funding a range of activities covering water, sanitation, and solid waste. IPE-\nAguas  de  Portugal  (Aquapor)  is  undertaking  a  range  of  water  supply  system  rehabilitation\nmeasures  in  Aileu  and  Baucau.  The  total  commitment  from  Portugal  to  date  is  approximately\n$2.5  million  (including  some  studies  for  solid  waste  and  sewerage),  of  which  $1  million  is  for\nactivities planned for implementing rehabilitation in 2001 primarily in Baucau.\n\nGermany  is  funding  water  supply  system  rehabilitation  in  the  districts  of  Baucau  and\n39.\nViqueque.  The  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  is  the  primary  funding  and\nimplementing agency, with some additional funding from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).\nThis  work  is  focused  on  the  district  capital  of  Viqueque  and  on  seven  subdistrict  centers.  The\nGTZ  budget  is  $1.6  million  over  two  years  with  a  planned  extension  of  two  years.  KfW  is\nunderstood to be contributing $0.5 million (DM1.0 million) to this work.\n\n40.\nThe  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  recently  committed  $2  million\nover  three  years  for  implementing  rural  WS&S  programs  in  Aileu,  Ainaro,  and  Lautem.\nImplementation will be undertaken by Care Canada beginning in the second quarter of 2001.\n\n\f8\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is implementing a program for WS&S for\n41.\nschools, which will cover some 200 schools by June 2001. In implementing this work, UNICEF\nis  working  with  former  Indonesian  Government  Health  Department  Sanitarians  who  have\nestablished  a  local  NGO,  East  Timor  Sanitarians  Association  (ETSA),  for  WS&S  sector\nactivities.  The  UNICEF  activities  include  WS&S  and  health  promotion  education  for  teachers.\nUNICEF  is  also  promoting  the  local  manufacture  of  components  (pour  flush  toilets,  well  rings)\nfor rural WS&S systems through technical assistance and training for village entrepreneurs.\n\nInternational  NGOs  have  undertaken  extensive  works  in  several  districts  in  association\n42.\nwith  local  NGOs  or  community-based  organizations.  The  most  significant  participants  include\nOxfam, Action Contre la Faim (ACF), Care, and the International Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC).  In  coordination  with  UNICEF,  the  European  Community  Humanitarian  Office  (ECHO)\nplans to fund WS&S for schools to be implemented by some international NGOs.\n\n43.\nThe  CEP  is  providing  funds  for  local  development  projects  at  the  village  level.\nApproximately  50  percent  of  the  project  funding  is  allocated  to  social  infrastructure  (including\nwater  supply).  Based  on  a  small  sample  of  second  round  proposals  received  to  date,  water\ncould account for some 10-20 percent of total CEP funding.\n\n44. WSS  undertakes  sector  coordination  through  regular  WSS  coordination  meetings\ninvolving  all  relevant  donors,  implementing  agencies,  and  UNTAET  departments.  The\narrangements are working well.\n\n45. WSSRP-1's project management unit (PMU) has played a significant role in supporting\nWSS  with  sector  coordination  activities.  It  has  facilitated  the  identification  and  elimination  of\npotential overlaps. WSSRP-1 has also been able to identify critical program gaps and to provide\nappropriate support to close these gaps in many instances.\n\nD. \n\nPoverty Situation\n\n1. \n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nEast Timor's massive political, economic, and social upheaval in the period from August\n46.\n1999 to September 1999 exacerbated the previously high poverty levels. By mid-2000, security\nwas being restored. Farming is the primary occupation of 85 percent of household heads. Cash\nincomes are almost nonexistent among the rural population. The poor are characterized by lack\nof education and low literacy, high dependency burdens, and a dependence on agriculture.\n\nUsing  survey  data  (in  the  ADB-funded  report,  East  Timor  Rapid  Assessment  of\n47.\nEconomic  and  Social  Conditions,  2000)  as  the  basis  for  estimating  poverty  from  1999  to  mid-\n2000, the head count index has climbed significantly, reaching around 75 percent. Prior to this,\nthe incidence of poverty based on the official Indonesian poverty line fell from around 37 percent\nin 1993 to around 25 percent in 1997, but from 1997 to 1999 it climbed back to 37 percent due\nto  the  financial  crisis  and  political  upheaval.  Prior  to  1998,  the  average  income  of  the  poor\n(those below the poverty line) was around 2 percent less than the poverty line. From 1998, this\nhas steadily increased to about 7 percent in the first half of 2000.\n\n2. \n\nPro-Poor Growth/Interventions\n\n48.\nSeveral agencies carried out much planning and implementation of interventions during\nthe  transition  from  the  previous  Indonesian  administration  to  self-government  by  the  East\n\n\f9\n\nis \n\nimplementing \n\nthree  pro-poor  projects:  (i)  emergency \n\ninfrastructure\nTimorese.  ADB \nrehabilitation:  repairing  bridges,  power  supplies,  airports,  ports  etc.;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  power\nand  sanitation  services;  and  (iii)  microfinance  delivery.  In  addition,  ADB  has  several  technical\nassistance (TA) studies: (i) poverty assessment and statistics; (ii) community empowerment; (iii)\ntransport  sector  rehabilitation;  (iv)  capacity  building  for  governance  and  public  sector\nmanagement; (v) rehabilitation of telecommunications; (vi) TAs in two aspects of microfinance:\n(a)  small  scale,  and  (b)  policy  and  regulatory;  (vii)  environmental  assessment  capacity;  (viii)\ncapacity building for local governments; and (ix) an economic policy forum.\n\n3. \n\nGovernance\n\n49.\nMany governance challenges face the new nation of East Timor. Democratic processes\nare  being  introduced.  Self-government  is  a  relatively  new  and  emerging  concept.  The\nchallenges will be to rebuild trust as a first step to participating in government, especially at the\nlocal level, and to ensure as much local participation in government administration as possible.\nA very important requirement of good governance is the skills base to provide the basic services\nof  government.  Basic  education,  preventive  health  Care,  family  planning,  and  improved\nagricultural  production  are  the  priority  areas  for  investment  and  capacity  building.  Important\ninfrastructure  is  also  needed  to  facilitate  the  delivery  of  education  and  health  services,  and  to\nstimulate commercial activity, especially in the agriculture sector. The reconstruction of schools\nand health clinics and their staffing needs are also priorities. The speedy reconstruction of land\ntransport infrastructure is critical to pro-poor economic development.\n\n4. \n\nSocial Development\n\n50.\nEducation indicators are generally poor. The last officially recorded literacy rates in 1986\nwere 51 percent on a national basis and 64 percent among adults. Evidence suggests a distinct\ngender bias in education enrollment. For example, in 1998, 52 percent of females over 10 years\nof  age  had  never  been  to  school.  Postprimary  education  is  still  disrupted,  and  literacy  among\nthe rural poor is less than 50 percent.\n\n51.\nThe  upheaval  in  1999  had  a  serious  impact  on  health  services.  Most  facilities  were\ndamaged,  and  130  of  160  physicians  were  reported  to  have  departed  by  mid-2000.  Existing\nservices in rural communities are extremely limited. However, emergency services are provided\nby  NGOs  and  donors.  Prior  to  1999,  life  expectancy  was  around  55-58  years.  Infant  mortality\nwas  moderately  high  at  85  deaths  per  1,000  births,  and  only  37  percent  of  all  births  were\nattended by medical staff. The under-five mortality rate was moderately high at 124 deaths per\n1,000 births, and immunization rates varied from 60 to 90 percent. Only 25 percent of villages\nhad a health clinic, and the average distance to a hospital was 75 kilometers.\n\nE. \n\nThe Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project - Phase I\n\n1. \n\nOverview\n\nAfter  the  1999  upheaval,  East  Timor  needed  assistance  in  rehabilitating  the  WS&S\n52.\nsector.  The  required  funding  was  estimated  at  $39.9  million  for  the  FYs  2000-2003,  with\napproximately $12 million-15 million expected from TFET funds and the remaining balance from\nother sources. Under WSSRP-1, $4.5 million was allocated for FY2000/01.\n\n53. WSSRP-1  comprised  three  components:  water  sector  management  and  investment\nprogram, capacity building and institutional development, and WS&S implementation program.\n\n\f10\n\nThe  activities  were  developed  in  consultation  with  other  donors  to  ensure  that  they  are\nappropriate  in  the  overall  external  assistance  framework  for  the  sector.  The  scope  allowed\nflexible  implementation  to  meet  the  changing  needs  of  WSS  and  to  ensure  coordination\nbetween the various donors in the sector.\n\n54. WSSRP-1  covered  only  initial  rehabilitation  of  the  WS&S  sector.  It  began  on  1\nSeptember 2000 and is expected to be completed on 30 June 2001, in anticipation of a follow-\nup TFET-funded WS&S rehabilitation project, subject to the availability of funds for the purpose.\n\n55.\nUNTAET was the recipient of the TFET grant. UNTAET established a PMU within WSS\nthat reports to the UNTAET Infrastructure Cabinet Member through the head of WSS. The PMU\nwas responsible for programming, administration, and coordination of daily project activities and\nplayed the role of an executing agency. UNTAET also established a project steering committee\nfor broad stakeholder representation.\n\n2. \n\nStatus of Implementation\n\n56.\nImplementation  began  on  1  September  2000  and  progressed  within  the  schedule  and\nbudget.  Physical  progress  is  about  90  percent  and  completion  is  expected  between  June  and\nSeptember 2001. As of 19 May 2001, disbursements from the TFET amounted to $3.2 million;\ncash expenditures, $1.9 million; and contract commitments, $1.8 million.\n\n57.\n\nProgress on the three WSSRP-1 components is as follows.\n\nWS&S Sector Management and Investment Program. The PMU was established and a\n58.\ndetailed,  budgeted  program  implementation  document  for  the  coordinated  improvement  of  East\nTimor\u2019s  WS&S  sector,  including  a  sector  management  and  investment  framework  (SMIF)  was\nprepared.\n\n59.\nCapacity Building and Institutional Development Program. In coordination with WSS\nand relevant bilateral sources, WSSRP-1 identified priority capacity and institutional development\nactivities.  Assistance  was  being  given  to  prepare  a  policy,  legislative  and  regulatory  framework\nand  to  prepare  WS&S  standards  and  guidelines  for  national  application.  Key  staff  are  receiving\ncustomer focus training. This component also provides timely assistance to evolving and longer\nterm needs, including support for the quick-response facility in component 3.\n\nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Implementation  Program.  This  component  provided\n\n60.\nphysical rehabilitation and development assistance to beneficiaries:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  WS&S  quick-response  facility  has  been  utilized  to  support  WSS  in\nundertaking  urgent,  substantial  repairs  to  and  rehabilitation  of  water  supply\nsystems across all 13 districts of East Timor.\n\nThe  Dili  water  supply  repair  and  rehabilitation  program  has  provided\nsupplementary  and  complementary  rehabilitation  work  such  as  small  local\ncontracts, construction contracts for deepwell drilling, as well as urban and peri-\nurban  low-income  works  such  as  repairs  and  rehabilitation  of  public  taps  and\nother  water  points.  The  aim  was  to  maximize  the  benefit  of  major  works  being\nimplemented by other sources, particularly the Japanese Government.\n\n\f11\n\n(iii) \n\nThe district water supply repair and rehabilitation program has provided a range\nof  assistance  to  address  the  needs  of  smaller  urban  and  rural  communities\nthroughout the 13 districts of East Timor. Community participation and planning\nprocesses  are  being  used  during  implementation  to  ensure  sustainability  and\nequity.  A  major  portion  of  the  assistance  has  been  delivered  through  local  and\ninternational NGOs working with local community-based organizations.\n\n61.\nExcept  for  the  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  disposal  activities  which  are  still\nbeing developed, most of the outputs for all the components have been achieved within the set\ntime frame and budget.\n\n3. \n\nBeneficiaries\n\n62. WSSRP-1  is  designed  to  distribute  its  benefits  in  an  equitable  manner  across  East\nTimorese  urban  and  rural  communities,  thus  contributing  to  sustainable  development  and\noperation in the WS&S sector and to poverty reduction.\n\n63.\nThe  immediate  benefits  include  (i)  providing  the  means  for  improved  water  supply  and\nsanitation,  and  (ii)  upgrading  the  quality  of  life  for  people  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas.\nWSSRP-1 is generating employment for local labor, thus helping to create a stable social and\neconomic  environment.  WSSRP-1  directly  or  indirectly  benefits  a  large  part  of  the  country's\n800,000 population.\n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n64. WSSRP-1  was  designed  to  allow  flexibility  during  implementation.  This  design  aspect\nhas  worked  well,  allowing  the  PMU  to  work  with  WSS  to  address  emerging  priority  needs\nthrough  appropriate  modifications  in  the  project  framework.  Other  areas  where  this  flexibility\nwas  evident  include  (i)  support  to  physical  activities  in  the  Japanese  Government  program  for\nDili  water  supply  through  the  community  activities  provided  under  the  Bia  Hula  NGO  contract;\nand (ii) the use of NGOs as contractors in the districts in which they have previous experience\nand  are  therefore  readily  able  to  assess  priorities  and  undertake  a  wide  range  of  physical\nrehabilitation, community participatory implementation, and hygiene promotion programs.\n\n65. WSSRP-1  has  been  extremely  beneficial  in  supporting  WSS  with  overall  sector\ncoordination  through  regular  meetings  with  other  sources  and  implementing  organizations.\nThus,  potential  overlaps  in  aid  programs  were  identified  and  avoided.  WSSRP-1  also  allowed\nthe PMU to identify and address priorities not being addressed by other aid programs.\n\n66.\nThe involvement of NGOs has been crucial to the success of WSSRP-1 because WSS\nlacked  resources,  particularly  in  the  districts,  and  the  rehabilitation  activities  are  not  for\nconventional  implementation  through  contractors.  Simplified  contracts  based  on  the  scope  of\nworks and priorities contained in the NGO proposals were successfully implemented within the\nconstrained implementation time frame. The use of NGOs has enabled community participatory\napproaches  to  be  integrated  with  physical  rehabilitation  implementation  activities  and  capacity\nbuilding for WSS district staff.\n\n\f12\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nUNTAET is executing a program of humanitarian assistance in East Timor, part of which\n67.\ninvolves  rehabilitation  of  WS&S  facilities  damaged  during  the  September  1999  crisis.  The\nchallenge,  however,  is  not  just  restoring  the  facilities  to  their  precrisis  status,  but  making  sure\nsustainability  and  cost  recovery  can  be  achieved  in  the  postcrisis  environment.  WSSRP-1\nprovided substantial assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of WSS by establishing\nessential institutional infrastructure including buildings, vehicles, tools and equipment for O&M;\ndeveloping policies including a regulatory and legislative framework, tariff policy, standards and\nguidelines;  and  supporting  key  operational  areas  including  development  of  information-\n(IEC)  capability  and  program  development.  WSSRP-1  also\neducation-communication \nrehabilitated priority public and community water supply works in Dili and the districts, and PMU\nadvisers  assisted  WSS  with  overall  sector  and  aid  coordination.  WSS  has  progressed\nsignificantly since its establishment and currently has operational units in each district capital.\n\n68.\nThe  remaining  challenges  are  significant.  The  capacity  of  WSS  to  plan,  develop,\noperate, and maintain WS&S systems requires strengthening through further support for policy\nand  systems  development  and  training.  While  emergency  assistance  and  support  under\nWSSRP-1 has allowed the repair and rehabilitation of existing water supply systems in Dili and\nthe  district  capital  towns,  WS&S  coverage  remains  below  developing  country  targets  and\nservice coverage improvement will require additional sector investment over the coming years.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives\n\n69.\nThe  Project  will  (i)  extend  the  operation  of  the  PMU  established  under  WSSRP-1  to\nimplement the Project and to plan for future development of the WS&S sector; (ii) implement a\ncapacity  building  and  institutional  development  program  to  provide  training  in  priority  areas,\nassist in key policy development initiatives, and strengthen the capacity of WSS to coordinate\nthe overall development assistance for the sector; (iii) undertake priority WS&S implementation\nthat  will  include  (a)  a  WS&S  quick  response  facility;  (b)  Dili  water  supply  rehabilitation  and\nimprovement;  (c)  district  water  supply  rehabilitation  and  improvements;  (d)  community  WS&S\nrehabilitation and improvement; and (e) extension of limited initial works to improve deteriorating\nurban  sanitation  infrastructure  and  services  particularly  in  Dili,  focusing  on  drainage  and  solid\nand human waste management. The works under (ii) and (iii) will complement activities that are\nplanned by other sources or are already under way.\n\nC. \n\nScope\n\n1. \n\nProject Management Unit (Component 1)\n\n70.\nPMU  advisers,  support  staff,  and  operational  expenses  will  be  funded.  The  long-term\nadvisers  will  include  an  East  Timorese  project  manager  and  two  international  advisers:  a\ncommunity  development  adviser  and  a  chief  technical  adviser.  One  of  the  two  international\nadvisers  will  be  appointed  as  PMU  team  leader.  This  team  will  be  supported  by  an  East\nTimorese  community  development  specialist  and  a  number  of  local  support  staff.  A  chief\nfinancial adviser may be appointed.\n\n\f13\n\n2. \n\nCapacity Building and Institutional Development (Component 2)\n\na. \n\nCapacity Building Technical Assistance (Subcomponent 2.1)\n\nTA to WSS will cover a range of activities such as policy development, human resources\n71.\ndevelopment, and institutional support including (i) training programs for WSS staff in identified\npriority areas; (ii) assistance in developing management and financial information systems; (iii) a\nwater resources study to aid in developing water resource management plans and institutional\narrangements;  (iv)  support  for  implementing  a  tariff  system  initially  in  Dili  and  selected  district\ncapital  towns  focusing  initially  on  major  water  uses;  (v)  support  for  developing  asset\nmanagement systems focusing initially on urban water supply systems; (vi) support to the head\nof  WSS  in  major  projects  and  aid  coordination;  and  (vii)  environmental  monitoring,  evaluation,\nand capacity building.\n\nb. \n\nInformation Technology and Communications Equipment\n(Subcomponent 2.2)\n\n72.\nEssential computer and communication systems will be upgraded, including establishing\na local area network for the central/Dili office of WSS including the PMU, and improving internet\nand  e-mail  facilities.  This  is  a  prerequisite  to  the  development  of  management  and  financial\ninformation systems and efficient day-to-day operation of WSS and the PMU.\n\n3. \n\nWater Supply & Sanitation Implementation (Component 3)\n\na. \n\nWS&S Quick Response Facility (Subcomponent 3.1)\n\n73.\nFunding will be provided for quick-response activities to support repair and rehabilitation\nneeds  that  arise  during  the  project  period.  The  activities  will  cover  design,  procurement,  and\nconstruction  activities.  Examples  are  restoration  of  transmission  or  distribution  pipelines\ndamaged during wet season flooding or through other natural disasters, which are common in\nEast Timor.\n\nb. \n\nDili Water Supply Rehabilitation and Improvement (Subcomponent\n3.2)\n\n74.\nEquipment  will  be  procured  and  contracts  implemented  for  priority  Dili  water  supply\nsystem  rehabilitation  and  improvement.  Priority  activities  will  be  selected  in  conjunction  with\nWSS and will focus on essential rehabilitation and reinforcement to complement the work being\nundertaken  under  the  Japanese  Government-funded  Dili  Water  Supply  Project,  which  focuses\non  headworks  augmentation.  An  NGO  will  be  engaged  to  support  WSS  activities  including\nimplementation  of  IEC  programs,  community  mapping,  and  problem  solving/conflict  resolution\nassociated with WSS programs. The NGO activities will not only support TFET-funded activities\nbut also programs of other donors, particularly the Government of Japan. Gauging stations will\nbe  installed  on  surface  water  sources  for  Dili  to  improve  the  data  available  for  reliable  yield\nestimates and future water resource planning. The meteorology station in Dili will be restored. A\nbudget allocation will be made for minor design, documentation, supervision and civil works to\nsupport priority activities.\n\n\f14\n\nc. \n\nDistrict Town (Public) Water Supply Rehabilitation and Improvement\n(Subcomponent 3.3)\n\n75.\nEquipment  will  be  procured  and  construction  contracts  implemented  to  rehabilitate  and\nimprove  priority  district  capital  water  supply  systems.  Priority  activities  will  be  selected  in\nconjunction  with  WSS  and  will  be  coordinated  with  the  recommendations  of  the  JICA  master\nplans and the proposed JICA implementation activities in the towns. NGOs will be contracted to\nassist in essential rehabilitation activities in the selected districts with a range of related IEC and\nhygiene  promotion  programs.  Gauging  stations  will  be  installed  on  surface  water  sources  for\nsome of the district capital towns to improve the data available for reliable yield estimates and\nfuture  water  resource  planning.  A  budget  allocation  will  be  made  for  minor  design,\ndocumentation, supervision, and civil works to support priority activities.\n\nd. \n\nCommunity Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation and\nImprovement (Subcomponent 3.4)\n\nRehabilitation  and  improvement  of  community-based  WS&S  systems  will  receive\n76.\nassistance. Because of the limited capability within WSS, particularly in the districts, appropriate\nmechanisms  must  be  selected  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  investments  can  be  implemented\nand coordinated effectively. Two approaches are proposed: (i) supporting other donor programs\nby  extending  their  scope  or  geographic  coverage,  and  (ii)  engaging  NGOs  on  contracts  to\nundertake  further  implementation  activities  in  priority  areas  within  districts  where  they  are\ncurrently active.\n\ne. \n\nUrban Sanitation Improvement (Subcomponent 3.5)\n\n77.\nAssistance will support key urban sanitation initiatives, particularly in Dili. Assistance will\ninclude  investments  in  solid  waste  collection,  septic  tank  desludging,  and  septage  treatment.\nProposals  will  be  developed  to  encourage  the  involvement  of  private  sector  resources  in\nproviding these services. Drainage systems will be rehabilitated by force account with focus on\ncleaning drains, structural repair, and mapping assets of priority drainage catchments.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n78.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $4.5 million equivalent and includes all costs\nfrom  August  2001  to  October  2002.  TFET  confirmed  that  the  amount  would  be  available  in\nFY2001-02 for the Project. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2 and outlined in more\ndetail in Appendix 5. The physical (14.6 percent) and price (2.4 percent) contingencies are the\nsame  as  for  WSSRP-1  and  higher  than  contingencies  under  ADB's  standard  procedures.\nHowever,  they  are  considered  justifiable  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  introduction  of  new\nlegislation, (ii) introduction of taxation, (iii) absence of insurance cover, (iv) lack of competitive\nenvironment, and (v) private sector premiums.\n\n\f15\n\nTable 2: Summary of Project Costs\n(US$ million)\n\nComponents\n\nTotal Cost\n\nA.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nBase Costs\nProject Management Unit (15 months)\nCapacity Building and Institutional Development\nWater Supply and Sanitation Implementation\n3.1 WS&S Quick Response Facility\n3.2\n\nDili Water Supply Rehabilitation and\n\n                        Improvement\n\nDistrict Towns (Public) Water Supply\n\n                        Rehabilitation and Improvement\n\nCommunity WS&S Rehabilitation and\n\n                        Improvement\n\nUrban Sanitation Improvement\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n                        Subtotal (A)\nContingenciesa\nB.\n1.\nPhysical contingencies\nPrice contingencies\n2.\n                        Subtotal (B)\n\n   WS&S = water supply and sanitation.\na Physical (14.6%) and price (2.4%) contingencies are included.\n  Source:  Mission estimates.\n\nTotal\n\n0.486\n0.585\n\n0.300\n\n0.625\n\n0.650\n0.700\n\n0.500\n3.846\n\n0.562\n0.092\n0.654\n4.500\n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan\n\n79.\ninclude ADB resources.6\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  will  be  out  of  the  TFET.

It will establish a PMU within\n81.\nWSS that will report to the UNTAET Infrastructure Cabinet Member via the head of WSS. The\nPMU will program, administer, and coordinate daily project activities in cooperation with WSS,\nmultilateral and bilateral donors, NGOs, community groups, and other stakeholders. Works and\nactivities funded out of the TFET will be fully integrated with aid-funded activities and projects.\nThe PMU will be headed by an East Timorese project manager (WS&S engineer) and include\nan  East  Timorese  community  development  specialist.  Their  selection  will  be  subject  to  ADB\napproval.  Two  internationally  recruited  consultants\u2013a  chief  technical  adviser  (CTA)  and  a\ncommunity development adviser (CDA), one of whom will be the PMU team leader \u2013will support\n\n6  An amount of $4.5 million has been earmarked in the TFET budget for FY2002 for the WS&S sector.\n\n                  \n\n\f16\n\nthe  project  manager  in  administering  the  Project  and  its  contracts  in  accordance  with  ADB\nguidelines. Total international consulting services will be 52 person-months: 32 for the PMU and\n20 for the capacity building. The CTA and CDA, in coordination with WSA staff, will program and\ncoordinate  daily  project  activities,  including  design,  supervision,  procurement  of  goods  and\nservices, and management of civil works contracts. The international consultants will train their\nEast Timorese counterparts in the consultants' areas of responsibility. The organization chart of\nthe  PMU  and  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  core  PMU  advisers  are  in  Appendix  6.  Under  the\norganizational  framework  of  UNTAET,  the  PMU  will  be  an  integral  part  of  WSS  and  will  be\nabsorbed by the service.\n\n2. \n\nTechnical Approach\n\nlabor-intensive,\n82. Where  possible, \nemployment-generating methodologies. Technical solutions will adopt least-cost methodologies.\nThese include maximum use of local labor, materials, and contractors, and simple technologies\ncontributing to sustainability of these works.\n\nthe  works  under \n\nthe  Project  will \n\nincorporate \n\n3. \n\nSteering Committee\n\n83.\nUNTAET will establish a project steering committee (PSC) involving broader stakeholder\nrepresentation  in  project  implementation.  The  PSC  will  be  convened  prior  to  project\nimplementation  to  inform  the  stakeholders  of  project  activities.  It  will  then  meet  monthly  to\ndiscuss  and  resolve  emerging  implementation,  procurement,  and  community  issues,  and  to\nreview and comment on the project reports for submission to ADB.\n\n4. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll  procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  The\n84.\nproceeds  of  the  Project  will  finance  imports  of  goods  and  services,  local  purchases,  and  civil\nworks identified under the Project. Under ADB guidelines, procurement may be off the shelf, or\nthrough local competitive bidding or international competitive bidding, as appropriate. Contracts\nvalued  in  excess  of  $500,000  for  goods  and  $1,000,000  for  civil  works  are  subject  to  the\nrequirements for international competitive bidding. International shopping may be permitted for\nsupply  contracts  not  exceeding  $500,000  and  civil  works  not  exceeding  $1,000,000.  Direct\npurchase of off-the-shelf items will be allowed for values less than $100,000. An indicative list of\nrepair and rehabilitation works and consulting services is attached as Appendix 7. The PMU and\nWSS  will  coordinate  with  the  aid  community  to  ensure,  as  far  as  possible,  that  materials  and\nequipment  are  compatible  and  of  appropriate  technology  and  quality,  that  spare  parts  are\nreadily available at a fair price, and that common standards and levels of service are used in all\nWS&S  projects  in  East  Timor.  Consulting  ser` ices  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Advance action for recruitment of consultants will not be\nrequired.\n\n\f17\n\nFor  purposes  of  this  Project,  the  term  \"member  countries\"  will  include  ADB  member\n85.\ncountries, East Timor, and all external sources and members of international organizations that\nhave contributed funds to the TFET.7\n\n5. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n86.\nThe Project will be implemented over approximately 15 months, starting in August 2000\nand  ending  in  October  2002.  Every  quarter,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation\nschedule  of  project  activities.  Project  implementation  consultants  and  contractors  will  be\nselected  in  accordance  with  activity  priorities  in  the  implementation  schedule,  upon  project\napproval,  and  when  the  Grant  Agreement  is  signed.  The  WSSRP-1  PMU  will  undertake\nsignificant  advance  preparation  for  a  detailed  activity  plan  for  the  Project  and  to  ensure  that\nconsultants  are  recruited  in  a  timely  manner.  The  initial  project  implementation  schedule  is  in\nAppendix 8.\n\n87.\nUNTAET  stated  that  most  of  the  works  under  the  Project  are  within  existing  rights-of-\nway.  If  needed,  UNTAET  will  obtain  rights  to  any  land  required  on  a  timely  basis  and  in\naccordance with ADB's resettlement policy,8 and provide compensation (including for crops), as\nrequired,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  relevant  guidelines.  Detailed  designs  will  minimize  land\nacquisition. The Project is not expected to require any resettlement.\n\n6. \n\nRights-of-Way\n\n7. \n\nDisbursement\n\n88.\nAs  the  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  agreed,  disbursements  for  eligible\nexpenditures  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  guidelines  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement\nHandbook  and  may  be  made  as  direct  payment  or  reimbursement,  or  through  an  imprest\naccount. The imprest account will be replenished in accordance with the handbook. The PMU\nteam  leader  will  be  responsible  for  transactions,  replenishments,  and  use  of  the  imprest\naccount. Payments under these agreements will be made by IDA, based on ADB\u2019s request.\n\nUnder the direct purchase procedure, the PMU will ask ADB to make a direct payment to\n89.\nthe supplier of goods and services. ADB will approve the request and send it to IDA, which will\npay the supplier directly. Request for payment will use ADB\u2019s standard withdrawal application.\nThe PMU will indicate in the withdrawal application the date on which payment becomes due to\nthe supplier. A separate application will be filled out for each currency in which the payment is\nrequested.  The  application  will  be  submitted  with  supporting  documents  such  as  contracts,\ninvoices,  receipts,  and  vouchers.  This  procedure  will  be  used  for  payment  of  (i)  consultants'\nfees,  and  (ii)  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international\ncompetitive bidding. Copies of signed contracts will be forwarded to ADB as early as possible to\nfacilitate timely payments.\n\n90.\nThe  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used  when  eligible  expenditures  are  paid  from\nUNTAET\u2019s  budget  and  reimbursement  claimed  through  ADB  from  the  TFET.  The  PMU  will\n\n                  \n\n7  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000.

The\nreimbursement procedure will be used for payment of (i) small purchases and (ii) short-term civil\nworks contracts.\n\n91.\nUnder  the  imprest  account  fund  procedure,  ADB  will  ask  IDA  to  advance  funds  to  the\nPMU to meet subproject expenditures to prefinance payments to contractors and suppliers. The\nimprest  account  will  be  used  for  short-term  civil  works,  small-scale  design  and  supervision\nservices,  remuneration  of  East  Timorese  staff,  and  small  purchases  under  all  cost  categories\neligible for financing. ADB\u2019s statement-of-expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursement\nof  expenditures  and  for  liquidation  of  the  imprest  account  for  payments  with  value  equal  to  or\nbelow $1,000 each. The currency of the imprest account will be the US dollar and the maximum\ninitial advance will be $1,000,000. The team leader supported by the PMU will be responsible\nfor  administrative  and  accounting  tasks  under  the  Project  and  will  establish  adequate  internal\ncontrol, accounting, and audit procedures to ensure efficient use of the imprest account and its\noperation. The imprest account will be established in Dili, subject to ADB's approval.\n\n8. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\n92.\nUNTAET, with the support of the PMU, will furnish ADB with quarterly progress reports\nconcerning  all  aspects,  including  finances,  procurement  of  services,  equipment,  and  all  civil\nworks  in  the  Project,  including  bilateral  activities.  The  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  expenditure\nbudgets  a  month  before  the  start  of  the  following  quarter.  UNTAET,  with  the  support  of  the\nPMU,  will  also  provide  quarterly  reports  on  the  use  of  the  recurrent  UNTAET  water  and\nsanitation  budget,  including  activities  and  expenditures;  and  report  progress  in  implementing\npolicy initiatives, WS&S regulations, and organizational changes. The PMU will also prepare a\nfinal project completion report on  all  aspects of the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant\nguidelines, one month before physical completion.\n\n93.\nThe PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, if possible. This bank account will\nbe  under  the  control  of  the  PMU  team  leader.  The  PMU  will  establish  and  maintain  separate\naccounts  for  all  eligible  expenditures  under  the  Project,  including  its  individual  contracts  and\nother project components, and will furnish ADB with accounts and related financial statements\nfollowing  international  or  other  appropriate  accounting  standards.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB\nwill  then  audit  the  financial  statements.  The  audited  financial  statements,  together  with  the\nauditor\u2019s  report,  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  within  six  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  The\nPMU  consultants  will  keep  detailed  records  on  the  costing  and  expenditures  of  the  project\ncomponents and will assist with reporting.\n\n9. \n\nTechnical Midterm Review\n\n94.\nIn  addition  to  a  schedule  of  regular  reviews  to  monitor  project  progress,  a  technical\nreview  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  within  six  months  after  mobilization  to  determine  any\nneed to adjust the project design or implementation. The review will also assess the adequacy\nof funds, cost overruns, need for reallocations, and other factors, if any, including assumptions\nand risks that may constrain the satisfactory implementation of the Project and achievement of\ndevelopment objectives.\n\n\f19\n\n10. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Implementation\n\n95.\nThe PMU will supervise and monitor the various contractors during implementation. All\nsector activities are expected to be implemented through the PMU, which will in turn coordinate\nits activities with the other sector programs through WSS. A comprehensive benefit monitoring\nand evaluation (BME) program will be developed during the implementation of component 1 and\nin  conjunction  with  data  generated  through  other  ADB  and  other  donor  projects.  A  set  of\npredetermined  criteria  and  indicators  will  be  identified,  based  on  the  key  information  needs  of\nthe  WSS  in  UNTAET  and  ADB.  The  BME  will  be  used,  along  with  the  conventional  project\nperformance  monitoring  systems  approach,  to  assess  the  progress  and  implementation  of  the\nuse of funds and delivery of public works and infrastructure activities, and measure the impacts\nresulting  from  project  implementation  strategies.  BME  is  important  to  identify  and  address  the\npriority  needs  of  the  intended  beneficiaries,  and  ensure  that  indicators  more  accurately  reflect\nlocal  experiences.  Key  areas  for  BME  will  include  (i)  technical  and  physical  aspects,  (ii)\nsocioeconomic  development,  and  (iii)  human  and  institutional  development.  Impacts  will  be\nmeasured  in  terms  of  increased  community  participation,  public  accountability,  transparency,\nbetter  provision  and  coverage  of  basic  services  (especially  for  women  and  the  poor),  and\nopportunities and direct employment generation.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nGeneral\n\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  social  impact  on  the  East  Timorese  population,\n96.\nparticularly  the  poor.  It  will  provide  safe  water  and  sanitation  to  a  large  part  of  the  population.\nReady  access  to  safe  WS&S  services  will  have  significant  long-term  benefits  by  reducing\nwaterborne  diseases  including  diarrhea,  dysentery,  malaria,  and  skin  diseases.  It  will  also\ncontribute  to  human  capital  development  and  reduce  poverty  by  putting  labor,  i.e.,  fetching\nwater,  to  more  productive  uses.  The  Project  will  maximize  the  use  of  local  contractors  in  its\nrepair  and  rehabilitation  works,  thereby  creating  jobs  at  the  local  level.  It  will  help  to  develop\nsector policies and institutional frameworks in which WS&S services are delivered so that they\ntake account of the needs of the poor.\n\n97.\nFollowing the complete destruction of all water-related infrastructure, it can be assumed\nthat  the  net  economic  benefits  will  be  positive,  especially  in  the  urban  areas  where  tariff\nschemes  will  eventually  be  introduced.  In  the  rural  areas,  freeing  labor  for  more  productive\neconomic  uses  and  reducing  health-related  costs  are  expected  to  result  in  the  project's  being\nnet economically positive.\n\nA key lesson is that in all aspects of WS&S project design, construction, operation, and\n98.\nmaintenance,  the  focus  must  be  on  striving  for  sustainable  solutions.  Experience  in  many\ncountries over many years has shown that the traditional least-cost approach to planning water\nsupply projects is inadequate to achieve sustainable resource use efficiency. What is required is\nan  approach  that  integrates  both  supply-  and  demand-side  concerns,  and  accounts  for  non-\nmarket  costs  and  benefits.  The  extent  to  which  benefits  from  water  supply  are  likely  to  be\nsustained will depend on greater recognition of the role that prices can play in managing water\ndemand,  expanding  supply,  and  conserving  the  environment.  WSSRP-1  is  addressing  the\nestablishment  of,  and  improvement  in,  tariff  levels  and  structures  and  further  support  will  be\nprovided  for  implementation  under  the  proposed  Project.  The  improvement  will  ensure\n\n\f20\n\ndifferential  tariff  regimes  for  different  customer  segments,  some  degree  of  cost  recovery,  and\nsustainability of services.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects\n\n99.\nThe  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)\nwas conducted in accordance with ADB's Environmental Assessment Requirements (Appendix\n9).\n\nThe  Project  will  involve  only  minor  construction;  as  such,  transient  environmental\n100.\ndisturbances  normally  experienced  during  construction  will  be \ninsignificant.  Typical\nenvironmental disturbances related to water supply and sanitation will include minor excavations\nto replace or install pipes and fittings and repair drains; temporary road and street closures to\nallow pipe and drain construction activity; minor clearing along short lengths of existing pipeline\nroutes  to  allow  repairs  and  rehabilitation;  clearing  of  small  areas  (up  to  20  square  meters)  to\ngive construction equipment and vehicles access to sites such as boreholes or other facilities;\nand minor, short-term, associated soil erosion if works are undertaken in high rainfall periods.\n\n101. Most of these disturbances will be on existing sites and only temporary. It is possible that\nnew sites will be required particularly for new bores, storage and associated facilities. Sites will\nbe  selected  after  community  consultation  and,  wherever  possible,  will  be  on  public  or\ngovernment-owned  land.  They  will  have  an  areal  impact  generally  limited  to  less  than  100\nsquare  meters.  As  most  works  will  involve  the  repair  or  replacement  of  existing  pipelines  and\nother  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  environmental  effects  will  be  insignificant.  Other\nworks  of  significance  include  the  proposed  repair  and  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of\nWS&S  related  structures  such  as  intakes,  pump  stations,  treatment  plants,  generator  rooms,\nstorage  tanks,  and  boreholes.  These  works  will  generally  be  carried  out  on  sites  of  existing\n(damaged)  structures  and  no  significant  environmental  effects  are  foreseen  other  than  normal\nsmall  building  construction  activities  such  as  cartage  of  building  materials  and  construction\nnoise. Again any effects will be small and temporary, possibly lasting from a few days to a few\nweeks.  Specific  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  contracts  for  works  at  or  adjacent  to  water\nintakes to prevent contamination of water supplies.\n\n102. A  potential  significant  adverse  operational  impact  is  the  increased  local  discharge  of\nwastewater because of improved water supplies. In many instances, wastewater discharges will\nbe  reduced  because  uncontrolled  connections  will  be  reduced  and  major  pipe  leaks  repaired.\nAny  adverse  impact  will  be  mitigated  by  repairing  and  rehabilitating  drainage  systems  in\nproblem areas. Any other potential or identified adverse effects will be preempted or minimized\nby  (i)  improving  water  resource  management,  and  (ii)  promoting  environmental  conservation\nthrough community participation and education activities. The capacity of existing final disposal\nsites will be considered for studies related to additional waste disposal sites.\n\n103. Some  project  activities  will  significantly  enhance  the  environment.  The  drainage,  solid\nwaste management, and septage collection and treatment will substantially improve the urban\nenvironment, particularly in Dili, through reduced flooding, improved water quality, and reduced\nhealth risks.\n\n104.\nThe  Project  will  also  contribute  environmentally  sustainable  development  through\nenvironmental monitoring under the guidance of the PMU. Monitoring will include (i) measuring\nthe effectiveness of any environmental improvements needed, (ii) identifying problems that may\narise  during  the  works,  and  (iii)  if  necessary,  providing  ecological  audit  information  for  future\n\n\f21\n\nworks of this nature. The proposed monitoring will be designed to quantify the benefits gained\nand  any  impacts  sustained  from  repairing  and  rehabilitating  town  and  community  WS&S\nsystems. The PMU  will  define environmental parameters to be monitored, and will include the\nquality  of  raw  water,  treated  water,  and  delivered  water;  the  need  for  and  effectiveness  of\ndrainage systems; environmental conditions in river and spring catchments, including pollution\nand  land  clearing,  landslide,  and  erosion  problems  affecting  WS&S  facilities;  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of sanitation facilities; and growth of algae in reservoirs. WSS will be responsible\nfor  all  water  quality  testing  (chemical  and  bacteriological)  and,  in  cooperation  with  local\ncommunities, also for monitoring construction and postconstruction environmental aspects.\n\n105. An  environmental  specialist  under  the  Project  will  assist  the  PMU  in  ensuring  that\nappropriate  environmental  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  implementing  project  activities\nand that the PMU implements appropriate monitoring and reporting.\n\n106.\nThus, while there will be some minor and transient environmental impacts, the medium-\nand long-term impacts of the Project are positive, especially in promoting economic and social\ndevelopment  in  East  Timor  and  facilitating  the  nation's  reconstruction  and  development.  A\ndetailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  required.  However,  if  any  new  additional\nfacilities need to be developed, environmental assessment will be carried out.\n\n107. Under  UNTAET,  Indonesian  environmental  laws  remain  valid,  although  implementation\ncapacity  will  need  to  be  developed.  UNTAET  is  presently  reviewing  environmental  laws,\nregulations, and standards, and these may be applied to the Project in the future, although the\nProject is not expected to result in any adverse outcomes. Conversely, the PMU and WSS will\ncompile project environmental reports, information from which will be passed on to the relevant\nsection of UNTAET for consideration when developing environmental standards and legislation.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Issues and Poverty\n\nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  impaired  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  An  initial\n\n108.\nsocial assessment was prepared (Appendix 10).\n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  positive  social  impact.  By  providing  the\n109.\nmeans for improved water supply and sanitation, the Project will upgrade enhance the quality of\nlife of people in both urban and rural areas who will no longer need to spend much time, energy,\nand  financial  resources  to  obtain  their  daily  water  needs.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  generate\nemployment for local labor, thus helping to create a stable social and economic environment.\n\n110. Under  the  Project,  a  series  of  participatory  exercises  at  community,  local,  district,  and\nregional  levels  with  citizens,  government,  and  civil  society  (and  the  private  sector  as  relevant)\nwill  be  led  by  a  participation  specialist  working  with  a  small  team.  The  exercises  will  permit\nassessment of progress and challenges in the ongoing WSSRP-1 and promote improvements in\nthe Project. Voices of poor and vulnerable citizens will be heard in planning subsequent steps,\nand  the  work  of  government  and  civil  society  in  responding  to  these  voices  will  be  reviewed.\nCitizens,  NGOs,  and  new  government  organizations  will  take  part  in  (i)  planning  sustainable\nwater and sanitation systems including local maintenance and management wherever feasible,\nand (ii) identifying and prioritizing needs for upgrading the skills of NGO and government staff to\nmaximize  institutional  capacity  enhancement  and  sustainability.  Plans  for  self-monitoring  and\nongoing sharing among groups will be made in conjunction with follow-up training and support\nat every level throughout the Project.\n\n\f22\n\nThe  Project  will  involve  no  relocation  or  resettlement.  Land  acquisition  will  be  minimal,\n111.\nwith  the  majority  of  facilities  being  constructed  on  public  land  or  rights-of-way.  Procedures\nestablished  during  WSSRP-1  will  be  used  for  negotiating  land  use  and  access  rights,  and\nappropriate  compensation  for  private  land  where  public  land  is  not  available.  The  beneficiary\nconsultations during WSSRP-1 confirmed widespread support for the proposed activities, which\nwill  be  continued  in  the  Project.  The  project  construction  activities  will  generate  significant\nemployment  opportunities,  and  delivered  services  will  free  the  labor  force  for  more  productive\nuses.\n\n112. Even before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in Southeast Asia. Based on Indonesian statistics, social indicators prior to the upheaval\nalready  demonstrated  a  low  level  of  human  development,  with  some  50  percent  of  the\npopulation  clustered  around  the  poverty  line.  The  situation  has  worsened  dramatically  since\nSeptember 1999.\n\n113. ADB\u2019s core development tenet is to combat poverty. Its commitment in East Timor is to\nprovide well-coordinated action to support reconstruction and long-term development planning,\nas well as humanitarian relief. This is being done by, among others, working to reduce poverty,\nwith  particular  attention  to  ensuring  quality  basic  service  delivery,  opportunities  for  productive\nsector development, and provision of associated infrastructure needs.\n\n114. Prior  to  the  upheaval,  less  than  half  of  the  population  had  access  to  safe  water  and\nsanitation  facilities.  Insufficient  water  constrained  sanitation  practices,  which  were  often\nnonhygienic. Lack of sanitation facilities caused major health hazards in poorer rural and urban\nareas.  Poor  households  were  further  disadvantaged  by  having  limited  access  to  basic  health\nand  education  services.  With  almost  the  entire  East  Timor  population  suffering  from  the\ndestruction,  the  need  for  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  water  supplies  and  sanitation  facilities  is\nnow even higher.\n\n115.\nThe Project directly addresses and seeks to overcome a number of factors that directly,\nor  indirectly,  contribute  to  poverty.  WSSRP-1  was  designed  to  distribute  its  benefits  in  an\nequitable manner across East Timorese urban and rural communities and the Project provides\nincreased  emphasis  on  community  WS&S  in  subdistrict  and  rural  areas.  The  Project  will  be\nresponsive to communities\u2019 needs, contribute to sustainable and participatory development and\noperation  in  the  WS&S  sector,  reduce  poverty,  and  minimize  environmental  impacts.  It  will\ntarget communities where the need is greatest and where poorer people live (rural villages and\nperi-urban  areas).  It  will  consider  the  different  needs  of  men  and  women  and  of  the  old  and\nyoung. Where applicable, it will adopt approaches to WS&S that counteract the problems faced\nby poor households in respect of service charges. In all areas, rehabilitation and improvement of\nwater supplies will free labor (both men and women) for more productive uses, thereby assisting\nin  the  fight  against  poverty.  Improved  sanitation  facilities  and  practices,  and  the  provision  of\nclean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly on children and infants, and reduce\nthe costs associated with disease and morbidity. This effect will particularly benefit the poor for\nwhom the costs of illness can be devastating.\n\nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures\n\n116.\n\nThe major risks and proposed mitigating measures are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nWSS  capacity  constraints,  i.e.,  the  limited  capacity  of  WSS  management  to\nparticipate  in  project  activities  including  design  and  supervision.  Mitigating\n\n\f23\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nmeasures  include  (a)  utilizing  PMU  resources  and  external  consultants  to\nundertake  most  of  design  and  supervision  activities,  and  (b)  maximizing  use  of\ntraining  and  demonstration  activities \nfor  WSS  capacity  building  during\nimplementation.\n\ndonor coordination, i.e., the potential for duplication (and omission) as the sector\nis crowded with a number of donors and programs overlap. Mitigating measures\ninclude (a) identifying overlaps through the framework prepared by the SMIF, (b)\nsupporting  WSS  major-sector  coordination  by  including  the  capacity  building\ncomponent  in  the  proposed  Project,  and  (c)  participation  of  PMU  advisers  in\nWSS sector coordination arrangements involving major donors.\n\ncommunity participation, i.e., the possibility that communities may be unwilling to\nparticipate  in  projects  because  of  economic  constraints  and  experience  with\ntemporary  employment  projects  during \nthe  emergency  phase.  Mitigating\nmeasures  include  (a)  a  uniform  policy  on  donors'  community  participation\nprojects,  (b)  use  of  NGOs  with  local  and  sector  experience,  (c)  involving  all\nstakeholders  from  day  1  of  the  Project,  and  (d)  empowering  the  community\nthrough  participatory  rapid  appraisal  methods  and  building  capacity  around\ncommunity-defined goals.\n\nNGO  capacity  constraints,  i.e.,  the  limited  capacity  of  NGOs,  particularly  local\nNGOs,  for  implementing  repair  and  rehabilitation  activities  and  associated\ncommunity  and  capacity  building  activities  in  districts.  A  measure  for  mitigating\nthis  risk  is  selecting  either  international  or  local  NGOs  currently  working  in  the\nsector and the districts.\n\nprocurement,  i.e.,  delays  in  appointment  of  consultants,  NGOs,  suppliers,  and\ncontractors  to  implement  the  various  activities.  Mitigating  measures  will  include\n(a)  early  preparation  of  and  agreement  on  a  detailed  program,  (b)  advance\nplanning  by  PMU  advisers,  and  (c)  simplification  of  procurement  by  appropriate\npackaging and streamlining or fast-tracking of ADB procedures.\n\nVI. \n\nAPPROVAL\n\n117.\nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the\nprovision  and  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  to  East  Timor,  as  administered  by  the  United\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor, in an amount not exceeding $4,500,000, to be\nfinanced by the Trust  Fund  for East  Timor, for the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation\nProject - Phase II, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n\n13 July 2001\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f24\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNo.\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nThe Project Framework\n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Profile\n\nWater and Sanitation Service Draft Strategic Plan\nand Organizational Structure\n\nOngoing and Proposed External Assistance\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for PMU Advisers\n\nIndicative List of Repair and Rehabilitation Works\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\n10\n\nSummary Initial Social Assessment\n\n25\n\n34\n\n45\n\n49\n\n53\n\n55\n\n62\n\n64\n\n65\n\n72\n\n1, 1\n\n1, 3\n\n1, 4 and\n5, 24\n\n7, 34\n\n14, 78\n\n16, 81\n\n16, 84\n\n17, 86\n\n20, 99\n\n21, 108\n\n\f25\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nTargets\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanism\n\nRisks/Assumptions\n\nSector Goal\n\nTo ensure the communities\nof East Timor have access\nto such water & sanitation\nservices as are considered\nessential for public health,\nfor protection of the\nenvironment, and for\npromotion of economic\ngrowth based on\nappropriate technology and\nmanagement systems\n\nReduced dependence on\nunsafe and inconvenient\nwater sources\n\nImproved health through\nbetter access to clean\nwater, appropriate\nsanitation, and improved\nenvironmental health\nknowledge\n\nProject Monitoring\nUnit (PMU) benefit\nmonitoring and\nevaluation (BME)\n\nWSS, health and\neducation groups\nand nongovernment\norganization (NGO)\nreports.\n\nConsultations with\ncommunities and\nauthorities\n\nWater and Sanitation\nService (WSS) continues\nto receive adequate\nbudgetary and technical\nresources, and initiates\nappropriate recurrent cost\nfinancing systems.\n\nContinued support by\ninternational funding\nagencies\n\nAppropriate transition to\nself-government with\nsound sector recurrent-\ncost financing systems\n\nThe Project will respond\nto needs from the\ncommunities as they\nemerge, and work with\nother donors whose\nscope and timing of\nactivities in the sector are\nclearer.\n\nProject Purpose/\nObjective\n\nComponent 1.

Key  findings  of  a  Joint\nAssessment  Mission  conducted  in  October  and  November  1999  are  in  the  Infrastructure\nBackground  Paper.1  Subsequently,  extensive  investigations  were  undertaken  by  an  ADB\nmission  in  preparing  the  Trust  Fund  for  East  Timor  (TFET)  Project.2  The  following  details\nsummarize the above documents and update them from field information as appropriate.\n\n1.\n\nWater Supply\n\n2.\nExtensive public water supply networks covered the 13 district capitals and reportedly all\nof the 62 subdistrict towns. Details available indicate a total of 44 discrete systems, 13 serving\ndistrict capitals and 31 serving subdistrict towns and villages.3\n\n3.\nOf the 31 systems serving subdistrict towns and villages, 16 were ibu kota kecamatan or\nsub-district  capital  (IKK)  systems  and  15  were proyek penyediaan sarana air bersih or  clean\nwater facility installation project (PPSAB) systems. IKK systems were operated by the 13 district\nwater  enterprises  (PDAM  or  BPAM),  which  also  operated  the  systems  for  the  district  capitals.\nConsumers  of  the  PDAM  or  BPAM  systems  were  charged  a  tariff  for  supply  of  water.  The\nPPSAB systems were implemented by the Indonesian Government through central Government\nfunding.  The  recipient  communities  were  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the\nsystems. It appears that a number of other public water supply systems were not managed by\nthe  district  water  companies.  The  existence,  origin,  and  status  of  such  systems  are  yet  to  be\ndetermined.\n\nA  master  plan  was  prepared  for  the  Dili  water  supply  system  in  1998  with  assistance\n\n4.\nfrom the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)4.\n\nOverall  coverage5  provided  by  the  public  water  supply  system  was  assessed  at  36\n5.\npercent.  In  the  district  capitals,  this  figure  rose  to  39  percent  and  in  the  subdistrict  towns  and\nvillages served by the public systems this reduced to 29 percent. A summary of the towns and\nvillages with public water supply networks is in Table A2.1.\n\n                                                \n1 Joint Assessment Mission, Infrastructure Background Paper, 1999.\n2 The Mission comprised W.

Typically  deficiencies  included  low  service  coverage,\npoor  maintenance,  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for  water,  intermittent  supply,  inappropriate\ntreatment  systems,  poor  water  quality  particularly  from  surface  water  sources  during  the  wet\nseason, and frequent failure due to flood and landslide damage to transmission pipelines.\n\nIn the urban areas of Dili and other towns, extensive use was made of private shallow\n\n7.\nwells.\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nVillages  and  rural  areas  not  served  by  the  public  water  supply  systems  had  extensive\n8.\ncommunity-owned and -operated piped systems. Some received water from public systems and\nothers sourced water from small springs or streams. Villages and rural areas, especially those\nnear the sea or on river plains, also used shallow wells. It was estimated that 48 percent of the\ntotal population of East Timor had access to safe water.6  This figure is probably optimistic.\n\n9.\n\nThe status of use of various water sources in East Timor is summarized in Table A2.2.\n\nTable A2.2:  Water Source Utilizationa\n\nApproximate % of Population Using Source\n\nWater Sourceb\n\nPiped system\nPump\nWell\nSpring\nRiver\nRain\nOthers\na  SUSENAS Census,1998.\nb  There is potential for confusion between source and type of system in this table.\n\nEast Timor\n13\n10\n10\n61\n6\n-\n-\n\n2.\n\nSanitation and Liquid Waste\n\nDili\n41\n37\n7\n13\n2\n-\n-\n\nNo towns in East Timor had sewers. Liquid wastes were disposed of via \u201cseptic tanks\u201d7\n10.\nor  directly  into  the  drainage  system.  In  Dili,  less  than  half  of  the  houses  had  septic  tanks.  In\nother towns the situation is less clear, but coverage is generally less than in Dili. The high water\ntables in many parts of Dili present a problem in disposing septic tank effluent, and systems are\ngenerally not designed for these conditions.\n\n11.\nThere  were  no  facilities  for  treating  and  disposing  septic  tank  sludge  or  other  liquid\nwastes. Tanker trucks were available to desludge septic tanks, but it was usual for sludge to be\ndischarged  indiscriminately,  often  into  nearby  drains.  There  were  no  significant  generators  of\nnon-domestic liquid waste in Dili nor in other East Timor towns.\n\nTable  A2.3  indicates  the  excreta  disposal  methods  used  in  East  Timor  and  in  Dili.  It  is\n12.\ndifficult  to  estimate  the  level  of  acceptable  sanitation  coverage.    Data  from  the  Indonesian\nadministration  indicates  that  38  percent  of  the  population  of  East  Timor  had  access  to\nsanitation.  This figure is probably optimistic.\n\n13.\nInstitutional responsibility for sanitation under the Indonesian administration rested with\nthe provincial and district Dinas Kesehatan or health offices (DiKes). In Dili, the DiKes within the\nDili  city  administration  was  responsible  for  desludging  of  the  septic  tanks  as  well  as  other\nfunctions  (solid  waste  collection  and  disposal,  street  cleaning,  parks  and  gardens,  drainage\nmaintenance).\n\n                                                \n6 UNDP Common Country Assessment. DiKesTk. I. Health Profile. 1998.\n7 The term \u201cseptic tank\u201d is often used erroneously to refer to a cesspit connected to a pour flush toilet.\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\n3.\n\nSolid Waste\n\n14.\nA  collection  system  for  solid  waste  was  available  in  most  towns,  with  waste  being\ndeposited in strategically located collection boxes. A disposal site existed in Dili and some other\ntowns.  The  capacity  of  the  collection  systems  was  grossly  inadequate,  and  indiscriminate\ndumping of wastes in drains and on roadsides was widespread. The construction and operation\nof solid waste disposal sites were questionable. Significant quantities of waste were disposed of\nby burning.\n\nIn  Dili,  solid  waste  management  was  the  responsibility  of  the Dinas Kebersihan  within\n15.\nthe Dili city administration. In the districts, this responsibility rested with the district public works\ndepartment (Dinas PU).\n\nTable A2.3:  Excreta Disposal Methodsa\n\nApproximate % of Population Using Method\n\nDisposal Method\n\nPrivate toilet with septic tank\nPrivate toilet without septic tank\nShared toilet\nPublic toilet\nDirect to cesspit\nBushes, forest, yard\nPond\nRiver, stream\nOthers\na  SUSENAS Census, 1998.\n\n4.\n\nDrainage\n\nEast Timor\n10\n15\n6\n11\n23\n29\n-\n4\n12\n\nDili\n34\n23\n6\n1\n16\n7\n-\n-\n1\n\n16.\nExcept in Dili, the drainage systems in most towns comprised a network of minor street\ndrains and were not of major significance. No doubt there are problem areas where the drains\nwere smelly because of the discharge of septic tank effluent and/or grey water, exacerbated by\nsolid waste deposited in the drains and lack of regular maintenance. Occasional flooding could\noccur during the wet season.\n\nIn  Dili,  the  major  drainage  system  constructed  during  the  Portuguese  period  was\n17.\nsubsequently extended during the Indonesian period. The Dili drainage system had been poorly\nmaintained  and  badly  neglected  for  many  years.  Deficiencies  included  poorly  designed  and\npoorly  constructed  drains  (frequently  lacking  level  control),  significant  solid  waste  and  silt\ndeposition reducing the drain cross-section, broken roadside entry pits, and broken or missing\ndrain covers. The drains were breeding grounds for vermin and insects and were a significant\nhealth  hazard.  Lack  of  maintenance  combined  with  poor  design  and  construction  caused\nflooding during the wet season.\n\n18.\n\nA master plan for Dili drainage was prepared in 1995, but has not been implemented.\n\n19.\nThe  responsibility  for  urban  drainage  in  Indonesia  has  always  been  unclear  but  in  Dili,\nthe Dinas Kebersihan within the city administration was responsible for maintaining  the system.\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\n5.\n\nWater Resource Management\n\n20.\nRainfall  records  were  kept  during  the  Portuguese  era,  with  complete  records  for  1952-\n1974 available from at least 14 recording stations with a wide geographical spread. During the\nperiod of Indonesian administration, rainfall data collection was less well-organized. The Bureau\nof  Meteorology  maintained  some  stations,  but  experience  indicates  that  processed  data  was\nunreliable.  The  water  resources  section  of  Public  Works  installed  small  but  complete  climate\nstations  (data  for  precipitation,  temperature,  relative  humidity,  solar  radiation,  wind  speed  and\ndirection)  in  irrigation  areas,  but  these  often  fell  into  a  state  of  disuse  a  short  time  after\ninstallation,  mainly  because  of  insufficient  operating  budgets,  and  any  collected  data  was  not\nreadily available.\n\nStream  gauging  was  the  responsibility  of  the  water  resources  section  of  Public  Works,\n21.\nbut  gauging  stations  were  often  improperly  installed,  especially  in  areas  of  shifting  stream\ncourses. The number and location of stream gauging stations are unknown.\n\nGroundwater  monitoring  was  not  generally  included  in  the  Public  Works  groundwater\n22.\nexploration programs. Most exploration was concentrated in areas where there was potential for\nusing groundwater for irrigation. The Ministry of Works and Energy, through the Directorate of\nEnvironmental  Geology  Groundwater  Section,  had  responsibility  for  mapping  groundwater\nresources throughout Indonesia, but because of a lack of funding and difficult access, only a few\nboreholes were drilled in East Timor.\n\n23.\nInstitutional  arrangements  for  water  resource  investigation  and  management  were\ndiffused, with the ministries of agriculture and forestry, public works, mines and energy, and, to\na  small  extent,  health  and  environment  having  some  role.  Interagency  coordination  was  poor,\nand most data collected was not readily available to potential users. Where data was available\nin processed form, the reliability was generally low.\n\nB.\n\nImpact of the Violence and the Indonesian Withdrawal\n\n1.\n\nWater Supply\n\nThe  major  impacts  are  in  the  urban  areas  where  the  destruction  was  most  extensive.\n\n24.\nThe key impacts may be summarised as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe institutions responsible for water supply operation and maintenance ceased\nto  exist  after  the  Indonesian  withdrawal.  While  many  of  the  technical  and\nadministrative support staff were East Timorese, the majority of the management\nand professional staff of the PDAM/BPAMs were Indonesian and their departure\nhad  significant  implications  for  human  resource  capacity.  (Many  technical  staff\nfrom  the  former  water  enterprises  have  assisted  in  the  process  of  restoring\nsupplies.)\n\nThe institutional infrastructure including buildings and other assets, technical and\nfinancial records, vehicles, tools, and equipment were either stolen or destroyed.\n\nConsumer connections were generally destroyed with the widespread destruction\nof the houses that they served.\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe large numbers of displaced persons that have moved into the urban areas,\nparticularly  in  Dili,  caused  further  damage  as  they  attempted  to  access  water\nsupply through illegal connection and physical damage to pipes.\n\nDamage to major installations such as treatment plants was limited. Some bores\nwere destroyed and the pumps and/or electrical switchboards removed. In some\ninstances, bore casings were filled with rocks.\n\n(vi) \n\nDamage  to  power  supplies  impacted  on  pumped  systems  causing  significant\nproblems especially in the early period after the Indonesian withdrawal.\n\n25.\nAnecdotal  information  indicates  that  damage  to  rural  supplies  was  not  extensive.\nHowever,  there  were  pockets  of  damage  where  sources  such  as  shallow  wells  were\ncontaminated.\n\n2.\n\nSanitation and Liquid Waste\n\n26.\nDamage to sanitation facilities occurred as houses were destroyed. In addition facilities\nfor maintaining and desludging septic tanks no longer exist. With the destruction of houses and\nthe displacement of residents, access to higher order sanitation systems in the urban areas has\ndecreased. The damage to water supplies has also impacted on water availability and use for\nsanitation.\n\n27.\n\nAnecdotal evidence indicates limited impact on sanitation systems in rural areas.\n\n3.\n\nSolid Waste\n\n28.\nThere  was  no  solid  waste  management  system  in  Dili  after  the  pre-independence\nwithdrawal.  Previous  systems  involved  both  community  and  institutional  participation  in  solid\nwaste  collection,  cartage,  and  disposal.  Equipment  (handcarts  and  trucks)  used  for  collection\nand  transport  has  been  either  destroyed,  diverted  to  other  uses,  or  removed.  The  Dinas\nKebersihan  within  the  former  Dili  city  administration  no  longer  exists.  Markets  had  been\ndestroyed but solid waste was still generated from market activities, as informal markets have\nestablished on roadsides.\n\n29. While the solid waste collection systems in other rural areas were less extensive, most\nhad  some  form  of  collection  and  disposal.  The  equipment  previously  used  has  been  either\ndestroyed or removed. The community and institutional systems for collection and disposal are\nno longer operating.\n\nThe large expatriate presence has a significant impact on the generation of solid waste,\n30.\nparticularly  items  such  as  bottled  water  containers,  soft  drinks  and  beer  cans,  and  a  general\nincrease in the importation of consumer goods. These problems are particularly apparent in Dili.\n\nThe  general  destruction  has  created  significant  additional  quantities  of  solid  waste\n31.\nincluding  building  rubble,  roofing  material,  car  bodies,  etc.  Much  of  this  still  litters  Dili  streets\nbecause  there  is  no  capacity  to  collect  and  dispose  of  it.  Asbestos  waste  is  mixed  with  the\nrubble.\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 2, page 7\n\n4.\n\nDrainage\n\n32.\nThere was no obvious damage to the drainage systems during the violence. Even before\nthe  Indonesian  withdrawal,  the  systems  had  gradually  deteriorated  because  of  lack  of\nmaintenance and increasing use of drains as receiving areas for solid waste including building\nrubble. Equipment used for maintenance by the Dinas Kebersihan including a jet pump for drain\nflushing has been removed or destroyed.\n\nThe impact in smaller towns and rural areas is less severe, but similar problems exist on\n\n33.\na smaller scale.\n\n5.\n\nWater Resource Management\n\n34.\nInstitutional structures and systems for water supply no longer exist. Any water resource\nrecords  were  probably  either  removed  or  destroyed  during  the  Indonesian  withdrawal.  It  is\nunlikely  that  physical  assets  such  as  stream  gauging  stations  were  damaged,  although  it  is\nextremely likely that many of them are no longer in operating condition.\n\nThe  greatest  potential  impact8  on  water  resources  since  the  pre-independence\n35.\nwithdrawal  is  deforestation  of  catchment  areas,  in  particular  those  around  Dili  and  the  larger\ntowns.  Kerosene  stoves  were  very  common  during  the  pre-independence  administration,  and\nkerosene fuel was subsidized as one of the basic family needs along with rice, cooking oil, flour,\nand salt. With the stoves reportedly removed or destroyed, the remaining population have been\nforced  to  rely  heavily  on  firewood.  Kerosene  is  now  far  more  expensive,  and  even  if  it  were\naffordable,  the  majority  of  the  population  still  cannot  afford  to  replace  stoves.  Widespread\nunemployment  has  forced  many  people  to  rely  on  firewood  collection  as  a  source  of  income.\nTraditionally, firewood collectors only took branches from trees which would recover during the\nfollowing wet season (eucalyptus mainly), but the \"new\" collectors are cutting down all types of\ntrees  to  maximize  the  amount  of  firewood  collected.  Reforestation  has  commenced  in  a  small\nway, and some project funding is being provided to assist in propagating seedlings and run an\ninformation-education-communication  campaign  about  deforestation  and  its  impacts.  Some\nfunding is reportedly available for disseminating designs for fuel-efficient woodstoves to reduce\nthe rate of consumption of firewood.\n\nC.\n\nInitial Rehabilitation and Planned Donor Activities\n\nThis  section  summarizes  the  initial  rehabilitation  efforts  and  the  major  current  and\n\n36.\nplanned external assistance activities in the sector. Additional information is in Appendix 4.\n\n1.\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\nThe Water and Sanitation Service (WSS) has been established and is operating. While\n37.\nthere is some uncertainty about its role and responsibility, particularly its capacity to sustainably\nmanage WS&S systems below the district capital level, the organization now has staff appointed\nin all districts, is managing 13 public water supply systems, and has begun the essential policy\ndevelopment and capacity building required to develop its capacity to deliver services.\n\n                                                \n8 Tais Timor (Local UNTAET Newsletter), 22 October 2000.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 2, page 8\n\nThe  strategic  plan  for  WSS9  envisages  broad  responsibilities  for  the  organization\n38.\nincluding  water  policy/water  resource  management,  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste,  and\ndrainage. Under the Indonesian administration, these functions were fragmented across several\nministries and levels of government.\n\n39.\nHowever,  WSS  is  a  new  agency  that  is  developing  its  staff,  institutional  infrastructure,\npolicies  and  legislation,  and  operational  and  management  systems.  WSS  requires  significant\ncapacity  building  and  is  constrained  in  undertaking  its  broader  responsibilities  by  insufficient\nhuman resources as a consequence of UNTAET-imposed staffing ceilings.\n\n40.\nRehabilitation is thus being undertaken in an evolving institutional and policy framework\nand significant resource constraints in all areas of WSS. The organization will play a key role in\ncoordinating  the  wide  range  of  aid  activities  for  the  sector,  but  there  a  need  for  flexibility  in\nplanning  and  implementation  to  ensure  that  activities  comply  with  WSS  requirements  as  they\nevolve.\n\n2.\n\nWater Supply and Sanitation\n\n41.\nSince  the  destruction  of  September  1999,  progress  has  been  significant  in  both\nemergency system repairs and planning for more substantial rehabilitation and augmentation of\nWS&S  systems.  Appendix  4  lists  the  major  external  assistance  activities  by  multilateral\nagencies,  bilateral  sources,  and  NGOs.  The  major  interventions  in  this  area  include  the\nfollowing.\n\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has completed the Study on Urgent\n42.\nImprovement for Water Supply Systems in East Timor. This study covers 15 towns including Dili\nand 12 district capitals (excluding Oecusse) plus the townships of Ermera (Ermera), Maubisse\n(Ainaro),  and  Vila/Beloi  on  Atauro  Island.  The  study  produced  asset  mapping  and  condition\nsurveys of the water supply facilities in each town and a feasibility study for a proposed three-\nyear  rehabilitation  plan.  Currently  being  considered  is  funding  for  implementation  in  some  2-5\ntowns selected from Liquica, Lospalos, Ainaro, Suai, and Maliana.\n\nIn  association  with  the  study,  JICA  also  provided  about  $1  million  to  fund  a  number  of\n43.\nimmediate  implementation  projects  for  leakage  control  in  Dili;  new  water  resource  facilities  in\nManatuto; rehabilitation of bores in Dili, Hera, and Liquica; and WS&S for schools.\n\nJapan has committed some $11.28 million to the planning, design, and implementation\n44.\nof improvements to the urban water supply for Dili. Planning for this phase was completed and\nimplementation began in March 2001. This activity is funded through the Government of Japan\nand implementation is managed by the United Nations Office of Project Services.\n\n45.\nAustralia has given significant funding for emergency rehabilitation activities undertaken\nthrough NGOs such as Oxfam and Bia Hula. It has also provided substantial assistance to WSS\nthrough  the  Staffing  Assistance  Program  for  East  Timor  (SAPET)  and  the  Capacity  Building\nProgram  for  East  Timor  (CAPET).  Further  capacity  building  assistance  totalling  $1.5  million  is\nplanned  during  2001-2003. \nfor  a\nIn  addition,  Australia  plans \ncommunity/rural WS&S program, which will focus on the districts of Kova Lima, Bobonaro, and\nViqueque over three 3 years commencing by September 2001.\n\nto  provide  $8  million \n\n                                                \n9  Office of Water and Sanitation. Draft Strategic Plan for the Establishment of an East Timor Government Water &\n\nSanitation Institution. March 2000.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 2, page 9\n\nPortugal is funding a range of activities covering water, sanitation and solid waste. IPE-\n46.\nAguas  de  Portugal  (Aquapor)  is  undertaking  a  range  of  water  supply  system  rehabilitation\nmeasures  in  Aileu  and  Baucau.  Portugal's  total  commitment  to  date  is  approximately  $2.5\nmillion (including some studies for solid waste and sewerage), of which $1 million is for activities\nplanned for rehabilitation in 2001, primarily in Baucau.\n\n47.\nGermany  is  funding  water  supply  system  rehabilitation  in  the  districts  of  Baucau  and\nViqueque.  The  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  is  the  primary  funding  and\nimplementing agency with some additional funding from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).\nThe  focus  is  on  the  district  capital  of  Viqueque  and  in  seven  subdistrict  centers.  The  GTZ\nbudget is $1.6 million for two years with an extension of two years planned. KfW is understood\nto be contributing $0.5 million (DM1.0 million) to this work.\n\n48.\nThe  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  recently  committed  $2  million  over\nthree  years  to  implement  rural  WS&S  programs  in  Aileu,  Ainaro  and  Lautem.  Implementation\nwill be undertaken by Care Canada commencing in the second quarter of 2001.\n\n49.\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is implementing a program on WS&S for\nschools, which will cover some 200 schools by June 2001. In implementing this work, UNICEF\nis  working  with  former  Government  of  Indonesia  Health  Department  sanitarians  who  have\nestablished  a  local  NGO  (East  Timor  Sanitarians  Association)  for  WS&S  sector  activities.  The\nUNICEF activities include WS&S and health promotion education for teachers. UNICEF is also\npromoting  the  local  manufacture  of  components  (pour  flush  toilets,  well  rings)  for  rural  WS&S\nsystems through technical assistance and training of village entrepreneurs.\n\n50.\nInternational  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  working  in  association  with  local\nNGOs  or  community-based  organizations  have  done  extensive  works  in  several  districts.  The\nmost significant are the following.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOxfam has undertaken extensive water supply rehabilitation in Dili and in district\ncapitals  and  subdistrict  areas  in  Liquica,  Oecusse,  and  Kova  Lima.  This  work\nfocused initially on the district capitals at the request of UNTAET, but the focus is\nincreasingly  shifting  to  subdistricts  and  rural  areas.  Hygiene  promotion  and\nsanitation programs are being incorporated into the activities.\n\nAction Contre la Faim (ACF)  has  undertaken  extensive  works  in  Manatuto  and\nErmera districts. As in Oxfam, the focus initially was on the district capitals, but is\nshifting to subdistricts. Some hygiene education and sanitation programs are also\nbeing undertaken.\n\nCare undertook water source cleaning and rehabilitation focusing on Kova Lima.\nCare  also  plans  WS&S  for  rural  areas  with  a  budget  of  some  $2.5  million  over\nthree years, possibly in the districts of Ainaro, Manufahi, and/or Aileu.\n\nThe  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  assisted  with  emergency\nrehabilitation of transmission mains and water treatment plants in Dili; the repair\nof hand pumps in peri-urban systems in Dili; and rural WS&S activities in Aileu,\nAinaro, Baucau, and Ermera.\n\n51.\nThe European Community Humanitarian Office is planning to fund WS&S for schools in\ncoordination with UNICEF, with implementation undertaken by a number of international NGOs.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 2, page 10\n\nThe Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project (CEP) is providing funds\n52.\nfor  local  development  projects  at  the  village  level.  Approximately  50  percent  of  the  project\nfunding is allocated to social infrastructure (including water supply). Based on a small sample of\nsecond round proposals received to date, water could account for some 10-20 percent of total\nCEP funding.\n\n3.\n\nDili Sewerage and Sanitation\n\nTo  accommodate  the  influx  of  UNTAET  and  peacekeeping  forces  (PKF)  personnel,  a\n53.\nnumber  of  barrack-type  complexes  have  been  constructed  and  septic \ntank  and\nevapotranspiration  disposal  systems  installed.  Some  are  not  operating  correctly  due  to  design\nand/or construction deficiencies and unacceptable effluent discharges to the surface. UNTAET\nhas also contracted a private sector firm to desludge septic tanks and cesspits. This service is\nlimited  to  UNTAET/PKF  facilities  generally.  PKF  has  constructed  a  lagoon  treatment  plant  to\nreceive  and  treat  liquid  wastes  from  these  sources.  The  facility  has  limited  capacity  for  the\ncurrent waste load. Further, the current management responsibility for this facility is not clear.\n\nPortugal is funding a study on sewerage and sanitation being undertaken for central Dili.\n\n54.\nThe draft report was recently released and is being reviewed by WSS.\n\n4.\n\nSolid Waste\n\n55.\nShort-term temporary measures have been implemented to manage solid waste in Dili to\ndate.  They  have  included  a  number  of  employment-generating  schemes  for  street  cleaning,\ncollection,  and  disposal  at  the  disposal  site  in  Tibar.  UNTAET  has  contracted  private  sector\nfirms  to  collect  its  waste.  The  service  provided  has  been  limited.  Burning  of  waste  by\nhouseholds  is  prevalent  as  are  indiscriminate  dumping  and  disposal  to  drains,  roadsides,  etc.\nThe temporary employment-generating schemes are winding down and there are no plans for\ncontinuing similar activities.\n\n56.\nPortugal  has  undertaken  studies  on  solid  waste  management  in  Dili  and  the  districts.\nDraft  reports  were  issued  in  late  2000.  They  included  recommendations  for  Dili  incorporating\nurban  street  cleaning,  collection  and  transport  of  solid  waste,  and  rehabilitation  of  the  solid\nwaste disposal site at Tibar. Portugal will not fund the implementation of these proposals.\n\n5.\n\nDrainage\n\n57.\nNo  systematic  work  has  been  done  on  Dili  drainage.  Some  minor  works  were  done  at\nthe end of 1999 in preparation for the wet season. Dili district has undertaken a limited program\nto construct concrete covers to replace broken drain covers.\n\n58.\nThe  disposal  of  solid  waste  including  general  garbage  and  building  waste  into  drains\ncontinues. The practice reduces the capacity of the drains to handle flood flows and provides a\nbreeding ground for insects and vermin. Sediment deposition and agricultural activities in some\nmajor drains are also of concern. Some maintenance work in Dili District has been undertaken\nwith short-term assistance from PKF resources.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 2, page 11\n\n6.\n\nWater Resource Management\n\n59.\nResponsibility for water resource management has been assigned to WSS; however, at\nthis  stage  there  has  been  no  organizational  or  physical  progress  due  to  budget  and  staffing\nconstraints (water supply has a higher priority).\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nWATER AND SANITATION SERVICE DRAFT STRATEGIC PLAN AND\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\nThe  Water  and  Sanitation  Service  (WSS)  March  2000  draft  strategic  plan  gives\n\n1.\nthe overarching goal or mission statement for WSS:\n\n\"To  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to  such  water  &\nsanitation services as are considered essential for public health, protection of the\nenvironment and for promotion of economic growth.\"\n\n2.\nTo achieve this mission, WSS has determined the following four main key areas\nof responsibility (in order of priority based mainly on expected immediate health benefit):\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nurban water supply\ncommunity (i.e. rural) water supply and sanitation\nurban sanitation (i.e. drainage, wastewater, and solid waste)\nwater resources\n\n3.\nObjectives  determined  for  each  area  are  detailed  in  the  draft  strategic  plan.  To\nachieve  the  stated  objectives,  an  organization/staffing  structure  and  budget  were\nproposed for FY 2000/01.\n\n4.\nUnfortunately, the East Timor recurrent budget constraints necessitated a budget\nreduction of approximately 50 percent, and staff reduction of approximately 60 percent.\nThe  budget  constraints,  combined  with  numerous  international  staffing  shortcomings,\nhas  allowed  WSS  to  focus  only  on  urban  water  supply  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,\ncommunity water supply and sanitation, to date.\n\nA.\n\nUrban Water Supply\n\n5.\nWSS  is  currently  managing  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  urban\nwater  supplies  in  Dili  and  12  district  main  towns.  Levels  of  service  are  sufficient  to\nachieve basic health objectives, although water quality is, at best, marginal. The longer\nterm objectives are continual improvement, and the management of water supplies in 62\ntownships  (i.e.,  all  district  and  subdistrict  main  towns  previously  supplied  with  water\nsupply systems by the Government of Indonesia).\n\n6.\nThe  achievement  and  sustainability  of  this  ultimate  objective  dependent  on\nincreased  budget  (primarily  sourced  from  water-user  charges)  and  local  staffing\nthe\nallocations.  WSS \nimplementation of water-user charges.\n\nthe  planning  and  resourcing  stages \n\nis  currently \n\nfor \n\nin \n\nB.\n\nCommunity (Rural) Water Supply and Sanitation\n\n7.\nSome 70 percent of the population of East Timor live outside urban areas. The\nprovision  of  community-managed  and  -operated  small  water  supply  systems  will  allow\nthis  large  population  to  access  piped  water  at  minimal  cost  to  East  Timor's  recurrent\nbudget.  Community  management  usually  results  in  a  lower  cost  to  users  of  small\nsystems, but is usually accompanied by a lower, but acceptable, level of service.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nThe  WSS  objective  is  to  facilitate  the  provision  of  adequate,  safe,  and\n8.\nsustainable water supplies for the rural communities. The establishment of community-\nmanaged  water  supplies \nlengthy  process,  requiring  extensive  community\nconsultation  and  participation  to  ensure  sustainability.  WSS  has  accessed  substantial\nexternal  resources  to  achieve  this  objective.  Such  external  funding  usually  includes\nsmall-scale sanitation improvements and environmental health education.\n\nis  a \n\nC.\n\nUrban Sanitation (i.e., Drainage, Wastewater, and Solid Waste)\n\n9.\nSolid waste collection to date has been undertaken by district administrations in\nan ad hoc manner and with variable success. There is an increasing need to implement\nmore  sustainable  waste  collection  and  safe  disposal  arrangements.  WSS  has  initiated\ndiscussions with Dili District to implement such arrangements through the private sector\nand to encourage waste minimization.\n\n10.\nRecent heavy rains have highlighted the need for proactive activities in drainage.\nAlthough flooding is a transitory inconvenience, it does decrease road pavement life and\ncreates  disease  vector  breeding  sites.  Again,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  maintain\nexisting drains and undertake drainage improvements.\n\nEast  Timor's  recurrent  budget  allocations  are  needed  to  implement  drainage\n11.\nmaintenance  and  waste  collection  and  disposal,  although  some  minor  external  funding\nhas  been  accessed  to  undertake  one-off  activities.  WSS  recently  recruited  an\ninternational  staff  member  to  focus  solely  on  achieving  sustainable  urban  sanitation\narrangements. WSS is confident such arrangements will be implemented within the next\nsix months, provided budget allocations are forthcoming.\n\nD.\n\nWater Resources\n\n12.\nThe assessment, responsible allocation, and adequate protection of East Timor's\nsurface  and  underground  freshwater  supplies  are  vital  to  the  sustainable  provision  of\nwater supply at the lowest possible cost. To date, budget and staffing restrictions have\nprevented  WSS  from  undertaking  any  significant  activities  in  this  very  important  area.\nExternal  funds  may  become  available  in  the  future,  but  will  depend  on  East  Timor\nidentifying water resource management as a priority funding area.\n\nE.\n\nLocal Staffing\n\nLevela\nApproved 2000-2001 Budget\nChanges arising from Oct Budget review\nApproved staffing plan at this date\nRecruitment in process CRO\nRecruitment in process WSS\nRecruited\n\n1\n47\n0\n47\n0\n21\n26\n\n2\n58\n0\n58\n6\n22\n30\n\n3\n30\n0\n30\n4\n11\n15\n\n4\n13\n0\n13\n0\n11\n2\n\n5\n4\n0\n4\n0\n1\n3\n\n6\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\nTotal\n153\n0\n153\n10\n67\n76\n\n CRO  =  Central  Recruitment  Office  of  the  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor\n(UNTAET), WSS = Water and Sanitation Service.\n a These are grading levels for local staff as determined by the UNTAET.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nF.\n\nWater and Sanitation Sector Coordination of Donor Projects\n\n13.

The  projects  include  the  Trust  Fund  for  East\nTimor-Phase I, AusAID's Capacity Assistance Project for East Timor (CAPET) and East\nTimor  Water  and  Sanitation  Service  Rural  Partnership  Scheme,  Government  of\nPortugal's Water Supply Rehabilitation, and JICA's Dili Water Supply Improvement.\n\nAll  projects  include  significant  capacity-building  components.  The  CAPET\n14.\nprogram, in particular, will place experienced technical advisers as counterparts to most\nWSS divisional managers.\n\nIn addition to these projects, WSS undertakes the national peak organization role\n15.\nin  the  East  Timor  water  and  sanitation  sector,  coordinating  the  activities  of  over  20\nNGOs and other agencies working in this sector.\n\n\fFigure A3: UNTAET/ETTA Water and Sanitation Service\n\nCorporate\nManagement\nDirector\n\nAdministrative\nSupport\n\nMajor Donor Project\nCoordination\nTFET PMU\n\nWater Resource\nManagement\n\nInfrastructure\nManagement\n\nAdministration/\nHR Management\n\nFinancial\nManagement\n\nUrban Sanitation\nManagement\n\nCommunity\nWS&S\n\nInfrastructure Devt\nand Rehabilitation\n\nInfrastructure\nAsset Management\n\nEngineering Plan\nand Design\n\nWater Quality\nMonitoring\n\nSupport\nServices\n\nOperations and\nMaintenance\n(O&M)\n\nDistrict\nO&M\n\nDili Water\nO&M\n\nDili WS\nDistribution\n\nDili WS\nProduction\n\nAdministration\nOfficers\n\nPersonnel\nManager\n\nCustomer\nService Manager\n\nCustomer\nService\n\nMeter\nReaders\n\nBilling\n\nDebtors\n\nSanitation\nOfficer\n\nRural\nWS&S\n\nUNICEF\nProject\n\nAccounting\n\nCash Receipts\n\nProcurement\n\n4\n8\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n4\n\n \n\nETTA  =  East  Timor  Transitional  Administation,  PMU  =  Project  Management  Unit,  TFET  =  Trust  Fund  for  East  Timor,  UNICEF  =  United  Nations  Children's  Fund,\nUNTAET = United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, WS&S = water supply and sanitation.\n\n\fSource\n\nProject\n\nDistrict\n\nSubdistrict\n\nTiming\n\nActivity\n\nCost\n\nRemarks\n\nONGOING AND PROPOSED EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE\n\nTrust Fund for\nEast Timor\n(TFET)\n\nWater Supply &\nSanitation (WS&S)\nRehabilitation Project\n\nAll\n\nJapan\nInternational\nCoordination\nAgency (JICA)\n\nUrgent Improvement\nProject for Water\nSupply in East Timor\n\n15 towns\n\nPhase I Sep 2000\u2013\nDec 2001\n\nPhase II July 2001\u2013\nDec 2002\n\nCompleted in\nDecember 2000\n\n$4.5 million\n\nOngoing\n\n$4.5 million\n\nPlanned\n\n$2 million\n\nUrgent Improvement\nProject for Water\nSupply in East Timor\n\nUrgent Improvement\nProject for Water\nSupply in East Timor\n\nUrgent Improvement\nProject for Water\nSupply in East Timor\n\nDili\n\nDili town\n\nQuick project\n\n$330,000\n\nCompleted in\nDecember 2000\n\nManatuto\n\nManatuto town\n\nQuick project\n\n$550,000\n\nCompleted in\nDecember 2000\n\nVarious\n\nVarious\n\nQuick project\n\n$50,000\n\nCompleted in\nDecember 2000\n\nCapacity building and\ninstitutional\ndevelopment.

The  risk  matrix  will  be  an  integral  part  of\nproject  monitoring  and  ongoing  evaluation,  with  updated  results  presented\nregularly to the steering committee.\n\n(iii)  Within three months of mobilization, the PMU will prepare a report setting down a\nsystem for project performance management and evaluation, in accordance with\nADB  guidelines.  In  association  with  WSS,  the  PMU  will  conduct  project\nperformance management and evaluation using inputs from managing agents of\naid-funded  projects,  NGOs,  community  organizations,  and  other \nrelated\nstakeholders.  Apart  from  regular  review  reports,  the  PMU  will  produce  special\nperformance reports for the midterm review and the final report.\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nBrief  quarterly  progress  reports  will  inform  UNTAET  and  ADB  of  achievements\nunder  the  Project.  The  reports  will  identify  any  emerging  difficulties  in  project\nimplementation, and outline proposed solutions. The reports will graphically show\nthe  status  of  project  progress  and  performance,  and  plans  for  the  next  months\u2019\nwork,  including  budgets,  and  quarterly  disbursement  and  payment  forecasts\nsubmitted  a  month  before  the  start  of  the  following  quarter.  The  PMU  will  also\ninclude and provide, in consultation with UNTAET, the WSS recurrent resources\nfor  the  WS&S  sector  including  activities  and  expenditures;  implementation  of\nexternal  support;  and  progress \ninitiatives,\nregulations,  and  organizational  changes.  These  reports  will  adopt  a  uniform\nformat facilitating project monitoring.\n\nimplementing  WS&S  policy \n\nin \n\nThe  PMU  will  contribute  to  the  review  report  to  be  produced  12  months  after\nmobilization. The focus of the review is to determine the need for any deviations\nfrom the project design or implementation.\n\nThe  draft  final  report,  to  be  submitted  no  later  than  one  month  before  project\ncompletion,  will  summarize  all  project  activities  and  recommendations.  It  will\noutline  continuing  training  programs;  programs  for  establishing,  implementing,\nand strengthening relevant institutions; and recommendations for future support.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe  consultants  will  submit  the  final  report  after  receiving  the  comments  on  the\ndraft final report from ADB, immediately before project completion.\n\n\fFigure A6: Project Management Unit Organization Chart\n\nUNTAET\nInfrastructure\nCabinet Member\n\nHead of\nInfrastructure\n\nHead of\nWater and Sanitation Service\n(WSS)\n\nWSS District\nOffices\n(13)\n\nTeam Leader/\nCommunity\nDevelopment Adviser\n(international)\n\nChief Technical\nAdviser\n(international)\n\nPMU\n\nProject Manager\n\nChief Financial\nAdviser\n(international)\n\nCommunity\nDevelopment\nSpecialist\n(domestic)\n\nProject-funded WS&S repair and\nrehabilitation, management, community\ndevelopment, capacity building, and\ninstitutional development activities,\nsubprojects, and contracts\n\nCoordination with and facilitation of\nexternally funded WS&S projects,\nactivities, and contracts\n\n6\n1\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n6\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n7\n\n \n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nINDICATIVE LIST OF REPAIR AND REHABILITATION WORKS\n\nSubproject\nDescription\n\nLocation\n\nProposed\nNeeds\n\nProcurement\nModes\n\nCost Estimate\n($million)\n\nA.

An initial environmental\n1.\nexamination  (IEE)  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development\nBank (ADB)'s Environmental Assessment Requirements.1 The summary IEE (SIEE) was based\non information in the IEE, which reviewed all project components to identify potential sources of\nenvironmental impacts, appropriate mitigation measures, and a monitoring plan.\n\nB.\n\nProject Description\n\n1.\n\nRationale\n\n2.\nThe  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET)  is  executing  a\nprogram of humanitarian assistance in East Timor, part of which involves rehabilitation of water\nsupply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  facilities  damaged  during  the  September  1999  crisis.  The\nchallenge, however, is not just a matter of restoring the facilities, but ensuring sustainability and\ncost recovery can be achieved in the postcrisis environment. While emergency assistance and\nsupport  under  the  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Rehabilitation  Program,  Phase  I  (WSSRP-1)\nhave  repaired  and  rehabilitated  existing  water  supply  systems  in  Dili  and  the  district  capital\ntowns,  WS&S  coverage  remains  below  developing  country  targets,  and  service  coverage\nimprovement will require additional sector investment over the coming years.\n\n3.\nWhile  the  Water  and  Sanitation  Service  (WSS)  has  progressed  significantly  since  its\nestablishment  and  currently  has  an  operational  unit  in  each  district  capital,  the  remaining\nchallenges  are  significant.  WSSRP-1  is  providing  substantial  assistance  to  strengthen  the\ninstitutional capacity of WSS and to rehabilitate priority public and community WS&S systems in\nDili  and  districts.  However,  WSS  capacity  to  plan,  develop,  operate,  and  maintain  WS&S\nsystems requires strengthening through further support for policy and systems development and\ntraining.\n\n2.\n\nObjectives\n\n4.\nThe  Project  will  (i)  extend  the  operation  of  the  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)\nestablished  under  UNTAET\u2019s  WSS  to  manage  project  implementation  for  15  months;  (ii)\nimplement  a  capacity  building  and  institutional  development  follow-up  program  to  further\nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  WSS  to  deliver  services  in  accordance  with  its  strategic  plan;  and\nundertake  a  WS&S  implementation  program  covering  public  water  supply  systems  in  Dili  and\ndistrict towns, community WS&S systems, and priority urban sanitation improvements.\n\n5.\nThe  immediate  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  improved  WS&S,  and  (ii)  enhanced\nquality  of  life  for  people  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas  whose  attempts  to  improve  their  status\nand health are continually impeded by the need to divert time, energy, and financial resources\nto  acquire  their  daily  water  needs.  The  Project  will  generate  employment  for  local  labor,  thus\nhelping to create a stable social and economic environment. The Project is expected to directly\n\n                  \n\n1  Office  of  Environment  and  Social  Development.  1998.  Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian\n\nDevelopment Bank.

It  is  designed  to  distribute  its\nbenefits  in  an  equitable  manner  across  East  Timorese  urban  and  rural  communities,  thus\ncontributing  to  sustainable  development  and  operation  in  the  WS&S  sector  and  reducing\npoverty.\n\n3.\n\nDescription\n\n6.\nThe  Project  will  have  the  following  components:  (i)  extension  of  the  operation  of  the\nPMU  under  WSS;  (ii)  implementation  of  a  capacity  building  and  institutional  development\nprogram  that  will  identify  and  implement  priority  policy,  human  resources  development,  and\ninstitutional  support  activities  as  well  as  support  physical  reconstruction  already  under  way  or\nbeing planned; and (iii) formulation of a WS&S implementation program comprising (a) WS&S\nquick-response facility, (b) Dili water supply rehabilitation and improvement to complement the\nworks being undertaken by other donors, and (c) district town (public) water supply rehabilitation\nand improvement in coordination with plans and implementation activities being undertaken by\nother donors; (d) community water supply and sanitation rehabilitation and improvement using\nappropriate and sustainable approaches through nongovernment organizations and/or other aid\nprograms;  and  (e)  assistance  to  priority  urban  sanitation  rehabilitation  and  improvement\nincluding drainage, and solid waste and human waste management.\n\nThe  Project,  particularly  the  WS&S  implementation  program,  will  have  the  following\n\n7.\nactivities:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nWater  supplies.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  improve  existing  public  piped\nwater  supply  systems  and  community  water  supply  schemes.  Rehabilitation  of\nexisting and construction of augmented facilities will involve providing pipelines,\npumping stations, treatment plants, and storage spaces.\n\nSanitation.  There  are  no  communal  or  public  sewerage  systems  in  East  Timor.\nImproved  latrines,  where  they  occur,  dispose  of  effluent  in  septic  tanks  or\nsoakage  pits.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  or  repair  some  damaged,  on-site\ndisposal  facilities  associated  with  markets,  schools,  clinics,  etc.  in  the  main\ntowns. Appropriate technology options will be utilized. As part of WS&S system\nimplementation,  community  awareness  programs  will  encourage  the  use  of\nimproved environmental sanitation practices and behavior.\n\nDrainage.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  selected,  damaged  drainage  works  at\nappropriate locations.\n\nSolid  waste  management.  The  Project  will  support  solid  waste  collection  in\npriority  areas,  mainly  in  Dili.  Proposals  will  be  developed  to  encourage  the\ninvolvement of private sector resources in providing this service.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\n8.\nTimor is the largest and easternmost island in the Lesser Sunda Archipelago. East Timor\ncomprises the eastern half of Timor Island. East Timor has a contiguous area of 19,000 square\nkilometers  (km2),  and  an  additional  2,461  km2  in  the  Oecusse-Ambino  enclave  inside  West\nTimor.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nThe island is along the junction of the Australian and the Asian geological plates and is\n9.\nthus  subject  to  frequent  earthquakes.  The  rock  formations  are  primarily  sedimentary  karst\nuplifted by the collision of the two plates. As the formation is recent, the karst is highly fractured\nand crumbles easily. Metamorphic rock from past volcanic activity is limited to the northern and\ncentral sections of the island. The high erosion rate from the crumbling karst layers has resulted\nin the formation of alluvial plains and isolated fertile valleys.\n\n10.\nThe main geographic feature is the mountain range that runs east-west along the center\nof the island and that causes watercourses to flow either north to the Banda Sea or south to the\nTimor Sea. Mountain peaks reach up to 3,000 meters in elevation, so watercourses are steep,\nfast flowing, and, because of the extended dry season, generally ephemeral. The river systems\nare short, cutting deep ravines into the unstable rock, forming deep canyons in the highlands,\nand  abruptly  widening  as  they  reach  the  flat  alluvial  plains.  Often  the  rivers  narrow  as  they\napproach the sea because of obstruction caused by sandbars and intertidal deposits. Countless\nlittoral terraces of coral origin and some extensive plateaus, also of coral origin, characterize the\nnorth  side  of  the  island  (e.g.,  Baucau  and  Laga).  A  few  alluvial  areas  occur  between  Lautem\nand  Baucau  and  in  Manatuto  District.  The  main  plains  to  the  north  occur  at  Batugade,  Lois\nstream, Dili, Manatuto, and Com. The south coast comprises a wide plain that extends from the\nborder  east  to  Viqueque  where  it  begins  to  narrow,  through  to  Lore  in  Lautem  District.  The\nenclave  of  Oecusse-Ambino  is  also  very  mountainous  with  a  narrow  coastal  strip.  Here  all\nstreams  flow  to  the  north.  The  volcanic  island  of  Atauro  rises  steeply  from  the  sea  to  a\nmaximum elevation of 999 meters on Mount Mano Coco.\n\n2.\n\nClimate and Water Resources\n\n11.\nSituated in the equatorial region, Timor has basically two annual seasons (wet and dry)\ninfluenced variously by the monsoon regime, proximity to the Australian continent, and locally by\nthe  orographic  effects  of  the  mountainous  topography.  The  wet  season,  which  lasts  from\nNovember  to  May,  results  from  the  northern  monsoon.  It  is  characterized  by  thunderstorms,\nhigh  tropical  rainfall  and  temperature,  and  concomitant  humidity.  During  the  dry  season  from\nJune  to  October,  winds  from  the  south  bring  little  rainfall  and  result  in  lower  temperatures.\nAnnual rainfall ranges from some 500 to 1,500 millimeters (mm) in the low-lying coastal areas to\nover  3,000  mm  in  the  mountains.  Depending  on  location,  average  wet  season  rainfall  ranges\nfrom  70  percent  (Kova-Lima)  to  95  percent  (Ambino)  of  annual  rainfall.  Districts  along  the\nnorthern  coastline  (Ambino,  Liquica,  Dili,  Manatuto,  and  Baucau)  have  the  lowest  rainfall,\nranging  from  about  500  mm  in  Manatuto  to  800  mm  in  Ambino  and  Baucau,  with  over  90\npercent generally falling in the wet season.\n\n12.\nThe  hydrological  regime  depends  primarily  on  the  climatic  conditions  of  the  alternating\nwet and dry monsoon seasons. Rivers in the area are generally characterized by their relatively\nshort  length,  steep  gradient,  short  flood  peaks,  very  high  sediment  load,  and  mobile  beds.  In\nmany areas, river and stream crossings require frequent realignment and repair due to continual\nchanges  in  river  channels.  Sediments  tend  to  be  very  coarse,  with  boulders  and  large  gravel.\nThe mountainous topography and streamflow pattern makes the construction of dams and weirs\nproblematic.\n\n13.\nBecause of the relatively high rainfall and abundant springs and surface water, and the\nsmall  population,  there  was  no  need  for  significant  groundwater  investigation  in  the  past.\nKnowledge of groundwater occurrence and quality is therefore limited. Groundwater is accessed\nin the mountain areas mainly through springs, which are commonly tapped at their source with\nwater  fed  by  gravity  to  towns  and  villages  through  small-diameter  pipelines,  often  many\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nkilometers long. Villagers along the coastal alluvial plains usually rely on open, hand-dug, wells\nfor their domestic supplies. In addition a number of towns in East Timor obtain at least part of\ntheir raw water from groundwater, via small-diameter deep bores equipped with bore pumps.\n\nTypically,  surface  water,  where  available  in  the  dry  season,  is  of  acceptable  quality.  In\n14.\nthe wet season, however, turbidity is normally unacceptably high with consequent implications\nfor  water  treatment.  In  general,  the  quality  of  water  from  springs  and  groundwater  sources  is\nacceptable for most of the year, though often hard. Communities in coastal areas may also have\nthe additional problem of saltwater intrusion into wells. The generally unfavorable geology and\nsteep topography in East Timor exacerbate the normal water resources difficulties faced during\nthe  dry  season  as  rivers  dry  up  and  spring  flows  recede,  often  to  very  small  flows.  All  this\ncombines  to  produce  a  hydrological  environment  in  which  securing  safe  and  reliable  water\nsources for town and village supplies is difficult. Recurrent droughts exacerbate this problem.\n\n3.\n\nBiological Environment\n\nTimor is on the eastern side of Wallace's Line. The flora and fauna are similar to that of\n15.\nthe tropical Australia-Pacific group. It has no large animals, but many small mammals, such as\ndeer,  and  brightly  colored  birds.  Timor  was  one  of  the  first  islands  settled  by  Europeans\nbecause of its proximity to the Spice Islands. A number of domesticated\u2013horses, cattle, chicken,\nand  pigs\u2013and  feral  animals  have  been  introduced  in  the  islands.  During  the  last  10  years,\ndeforestation was officially estimated at 70,000 hectares, with the unofficial estimate double this\nlevel.  The  central  highlands  are  planted  to  coffee,  which  commands  a  high  price  in  the  world\nmarket because of its higher-than-normal alkaline properties. Rice, corn, sorghum, beans, and\nroot crops are grown in the lowlands. Slash-and-burn agriculture is common even on the steep\nhillsides. A major environmental issue is deforestation of catchment areas through timber cutting\nfor fuel, which has increased significantly since the Indonesian withdrawal, particularly in areas\naround Dili and the major towns.\n\n4.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\n16.\nMost of the population is concentrated in the northern coastal towns and in fertile valleys\nin  the  interior.  The  coastal  flatlands  in  the  south  are  sparsely  populated  because  of  the  harsh\nmountain terrain that divides the island. Sea travel from the north to the south is constrained by\nstrong waves most of the year. The economy is based on agriculture, with coffee as the major\nexport crop. Surplus rice, corn, and other agricultural produce are consumed within the island.\nThere is little industry or manufacturing. A number of mineral deposits have been identified, but\ntheir  commercial  potential  has  not  been  explored.  During  the  Indonesian  period,  the  service\nindustry  was \nthe  civil  service  and  state-owned  corporations,  such  as\ntelecommunications,  power  and  water,  and  oil  and  gas  distribution.  Trading  and  other\ncommercial  activities  were  limited  to  traditional  marketplaces  in  small  settlements.  Banks,\nrestaurants, hotels, and other businesses were mostly in the two large centers: Dili and Baucau.\nMost formal businesses were burned down during the postconsultation destruction.\n\nlimited \n\nto \n\nAlmost  70  percent  of  the  schools  were  destroyed  during  the  postconsultation\n17.\ndestruction.  School  reconstruction  has  progressed  significantly  through  other  Trust  Fund  for\nEast Timor programs and support from other sources. Tetum is the local language, with Bahasa\nIndonesia  and  Portuguese  spoken  by  sizable  portions  of  the  population.  Almost  95  percent  of\nthe population are Roman Catholics, and the Muslim and Protestant populations are small.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nThe dislocation of large numbers of people as a consequence of the violence has had an\n18.\nimpact in many areas of East Timor. A significant number (perhaps up to 100,000) of refugees\nremain to be repatriated from West Timor.\n\nD.\n\nScreening Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n19.\nEnvironmental  Problems  Due  to  Project  Location.  These  problems  cannot  be\nassessed  at  this  stage  since  the  exact  location  of  project  activities  will  be  determined  during\nimplementation.  The  activities  are  likely  to  be  in  various  towns  and  rural  areas  across  East\nTimor,  and  will  be  determined  by  circumstances  like  priorities  of  other  donors.  However,  the\nProject will support only small works comprising the repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities\nthat  were  either  deliberately  damaged  in  the  postconsultation  period  or  are  otherwise\nunserviceable. Only a few new facilities to improve the effectiveness of existing facilities will be\nconstructed. Therefore, no significant environmental impact related to project sites is expected.\n\n20.\nEnvironmental  Problems  Related  to  Design.  Comments  in  paragraph  19  apply.\nDesigns for the rehabilitation and improvement works will have to generally observe preexisting\narrangements  and  thus  there  is  little  latitude  for  the  Project  to  make  significant  changes  to\naccommodate environmental problems that may be encountered. However, if any problems are\nencountered,  they  will  be  mitigated  using  good  environmental  practices  incorporated  in  the\nproject design.\n\n21.\nEnvironmental  Problems  Associated  with  Construction  Stage.  The  Project  will\ninvolve  only  minor  construction.  As  such,  transient  environmental  disturbances  normally\nexperienced during construction will be insignificant. Typical environmental disturbances related\nto  WS&S  will  include  minor  excavations  to  replace  pipes  and  fittings  and  repair  drains,\ntemporary  road  and  street  closures  to  allow  pipe  and  drain  replacement,  minor  clearing  along\nshort lengths of pipeline routes to allow rehabilitation/construction, clearing of small areas (up to\n20  meters  square  [m2])  for  drill  rig  and  truck  access  to  bore  sites,  and  minor  short-term\nassociated  soil  erosion  if  works  are  undertaken  in  high-rainfall  periods.  Most  of  these\ndisturbances will be temporary and will have an areal impact generally limited to 10-100 m2. As\nmost works will involve the repair or replacement of existing pipelines and other WS&S facilities,\nenvironmental effects will be insignificant. Other possible works are the repair and rehabilitation\nand/or construction of WSS-related structures such as intakes, pump stations, treatment plants,\ngenerator  rooms,  storage  tanks,  and  boreholes.  These  works  will  generally  be  carried  out  on\nsites  of  existing  (damaged)  structures  and  no  significant  environmental  effects  are  foreseen\nother  than  normal,  small-construction  activities  such  as  cartage  of  building  materials  and\nconstruction noise. Again, any effects will be small and temporary, possibly lasting from a few\ndays  to  a  few  weeks.  Specific  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  contracts  for  works  at  or\nadjacent to water intakes to prevent contamination of water supplies.\n\n22.\nEnvironmental  Problems  Resulting  from  Project  Operations.  A  potential  adverse\noperational  impact  is  increased  local  discharge  of  wastewater  because  of  improved  water\nsupplies. In many instances wastewater discharges will be reduced because of improvement to\nuncontrolled connections and repair of major pipe leaks. Therefore, the Project will emphasize\nthe  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  drainage  systems  in  problematic  areas.  Any  other  potential  or\nidentified  adverse  effects  will  be  preempted  or  minimized  by  (i)  improving  water  resource\nmanagement,  and  (ii)  increasing  promotion  of  environmental  conservation  through  community\nparticipation  and  education  activities.  The  capacity  of  existing  final  disposal  sites  will  be\nconsidered  for  studies  related  to  additional  waste  disposal  sites.  The  issue  of  sustainability  of\nsystem  operation  is  being  addressed  through  capacity  building  and  institutional  development\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\nactivities under the Project and through cooperation with WSS and donor partners active in the\nWS&S sector.\n\n23\nPotential  Environmental  Enhancement  Measures.  Some  project  activities  will\nsignificantly enhance the environment. In particular, the drainage, solid waste management, and\nseptage collection and treatment will substantially improve the urban environment, particularly in\nDili.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  environmentally  sustainable  development,  in  the  sector,\nthrough environmental monitoring under the guidance of the PMU.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nMonitoring  will  comprise  (i)  measuring \n\n24.\nthe  effectiveness  of  any  environmental\nimprovements  needed;  (ii)  identifying  problems  that  may  arise  during  the  construction  works;\nand (iii) providing, if necessary, ecological audit information for future works of this nature. The\nproposed monitoring will be designed to quantify the benefits gained and any impacts sustained\nfrom repairing and rehabilitating town and community WS&S systems.\n\n25.\nEnvironmental parameters to be monitored will be defined by the PMU, and will include\nthe  qualioty  of  raw  water,  treated  water,  and  delivered  water;  need  for  and  effectiveness  of\ndrainage systems; environmental conditions in river and spring catchments, including pollution\nand  land  clearing,  landslide  and  erosion  problems  affecting  WS&S  facilities;  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of sanitation facilities; and growth of algae in reservoirs.\n\n26. WSS  will  be  responsible  for  all  water  quality  testing  (chemical  and  bacteriological).  In\ncooperation  with  local  communities,  WSS  will  also  be  responsible  for  monitoring  construction\nand postconstruction environmental aspects of the project.\n\n27.\nUnder  UNTAET,  Indonesian  environmental  laws  remain  valid,  but  their  implementation\ncapacity  will  need  to  be  strengthened.  UNTAET  is  presently  reviewing  environmental  laws,\nregulations,  and  standards;  these  may  be  applied  to  the  Project  in  the  future,  although  the\nProject is not expected to result in any adverse outcomes.\n\nThe  PMU  and  WSS  will  compile  project  environmental  reports,  information  from  which\n28.\nwill  be  passed  on  to  the  relevant  sections  of  UNTAET  for  consideration  when  environmental\nstandards and legislation are developed.\n\nAn  environmental  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  PMU  in  ensuring  that\n29. \nappropriate  environmental  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  implementing  project  activities\nand that the PMU implements appropriate monitoring and reporting.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n30.\nThe Project will substantially improve the environmental conditions in the project area by\nrehabilitating  and  repairing  the  existing  facilities  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the\nresponsible  institution  as  well  as  through  an  improvement  program  that  will  educate  the\ncommunities  to  participate  in  maintaining  good  environmental  conditions,  e.g.,  managing\nhousehold wastes, maintaining the drainage system. Apart from the immediate beneficial impact\nof  cleaning  up,  repairing,  and  rehabilitating  WS&S  infrastructure,  the  project  will  encourage\n\n                  \n\n2 TA 3501-ETM: Environmental Assessment Capacity Improvement, for $250,000, approved on 15 September 2000.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\npromotion  of  environmental  health  and  hygiene  education,  ensuring  that  correct  health\nprocedures  and  water  conservation  measures  are  undertaken.  The  Project  will  improve  the\nmanagement of wastewater, and the solid waste and drainage systems.\n\nAny environmental impacts associated with the Project will be minor and temporary, will\n31.\nbe minimized by proper measures, and will be monitored by the PMU. Since the Project is part\nof the overall existing facilities, the result of the monitoring plan will generate a comprehensive\nmonitoring report touching on other investments in water supply and sanitation by other donors.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\n32.\nThe  Project  will  not  generate  any  significant  adverse  impact,  but  will  result  in\nenvironmental  improvements.  Therefore,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  not\nwarranted.  However,  is  any  additional  new  facilities  need  to  be  developed,  an  environmental\nassessment will be carried out.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nAn  initial  social  assessment  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  Fact-Finding/Appraisal  Mission.  The  report  was  prepared  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations.\n\nB.\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nIn  1998,  East  Timor  had  an  estimated  population  of  under  0.9  million  people,  over  50\n2.\npercent  of  whom  had  been  displaced  during  the  postconsultation  violence.  It  is  estimated  that\nupward of 85 percent have returned to their homes since the end of 1999. About 80-90 percent\nof the population live in rural areas, with the remainder living in the capital Dili and in 12 main\ntowns. The towns have formal urban dwellers, and an estimated 50 percent squatters and peri-\nurban populations.\n\n3.\nEven before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in southeast Asia, with severe problems of adult literacy (64 percent), life expectancy (55-\n58 years), and infant mortality moderately high at 85 deaths per 1,000 live births, only 25 percent\nof villages had a health clinic, and health indicators demonstrated that East Timor was one of the\nunhealthiest provinces within Indonesia.1 The fall in the value of the rupiah against the dollar as\na result of the Asian financial crisis reduced real gross domestic product to only $246 in 1997.\nThe  incidence  of  poverty  fell  from  37  percent  in  1993  to  around  25  percent  in  1997,and  then\nclimbed back to 37 percent due to the financial crisis and political upheaval. This has increased\nto  75  percent  in  1999-2000  as  a  result  of  the  political,  economic,  and  social  upheaval  from\nAugust  1999  to  September  2000  (footnote  1).  In  the  rural  sector,  the  destruction  of  people's\nmeans  of  agricultural  production,  the  closure  of  banks,  and  loss  of  meager  savings  resulted  in\nEast Timor being considered one of the absolutely poorest countries in the world.\n\n4.\nUnder most Timorese traditional systems, the role of women was severely restricted, with\nmen  dominating  in  decision  making  and  leadership  roles  within  the  villages.  These  roles  are\nchanging  as  a  result  of  the  social  disruption  caused  by  the  country's  long-term  struggle  for\nindependence,  with  women  participating  fully  in  the  clandestine  front  and  in  the  armed\nresistance.  Women  are  gaining  new  skills  and  responsibilities,  and  are  beginning  to  move  into\ntraditionally  male-dominated  income-generating  activities.  It  is  imperative  that  this  respect  and\nnewly acquired roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\n\nC.\n\nNeeds, Demands, and Absorptive Capacity\n\n5.\nPrior to the upheaval it is estimated that less than half the population had access to safe\nwater  (48  percent)  and  sanitation  (38  percent)  facilities.  Sanitation  practices,  which  were  often\nunhygienic,  were  constrained  by  the  absence  of  sufficient  water.  Dry  pit  latrines  were  used\nextensively  and  were  often  located  adjacent  to  water  courses,  or  households.  Major  health\nhazards were due to lack of sanitation facilities in poorer rural and urban areas. Poor households\nwere further disadvantaged, with poor access to basic health and education services.\n\n                  \n\n1  Initial  Poverty  Assessment  East  Timor,  Asian  Development  Bank  in  collaboration  with  the  East  Timor  Transitional\n\nAdministration, September 2000.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nto \n\nWith \n\nthe  substantial  damage \n\ninfrastructure  and  public  utilities \n\nthe\n6.\npostconsultation violence, already degraded services ceased to function. Most communities had\naccess  to  water  through  traditional  means  or  through  some  emergency  reconstruction  works.\nThe  situation  worsened  with  the  onset  of  the  dry  season.  Emergency  programs  funded  by\nvarious  donors  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  had  generally  restored  basic  water\nsupply  services  in  Dili  and  in  district  capitals  by  the  start  of  the  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation\nRehabilitation Program, Phase I (WSSRP-1).\n\nfollowing \n\nIn this environment, the immediate tasks of WSSRP-1 and the proposed Project will be to\n7.\nensure the establishment of a comprehensive and equitable water supply and sanitation (WS&S)\nprogram that will eventually provide adequate supplies and an appropriate level of service for all\npeople in East Timor. It is important to implement this program within the constraints imposed by\nthe  community's  commitments  to  other  programs,  restricted  financial  and  institutional  capacity,\nand other competing community and household objectives.\n\n8.\nIn all areas, the rehabilitation and development of water supplies will free labor (both men\nand  women)  for  more  productive  uses.  Improved  sanitation  facilities  and  practices,  and  the\nprovision  of  clean  water  will  have  beneficial  health  effects,  particularly  on  children  and  infants,\nand reduce the costs associated with disease and morbidity.\n\nD.\n\nAdverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n\n9.\nThe Project will not involve any significant land acquisition. Small areas of land may be\nrequired for facilities such as intakes or borehole sites. In such situations, rights of access and\nuse  will  be  negotiated  for  a  period  of,  say,  50  years,  with  compensation  to  include  damage  to\ncrops. No resettlement is required under the Project. Project works will use the existing rights-of-\nway wherever possible. The Project will not have negative impacts on any vulnerable group.\n\nE.\n\nSocial Dimensions in Project Design\n\n1.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nThe  remoteness  of  many  of  the  communities  and  the  difficulty  of  access  to  the\n10.\nsettlements made it almost impossible in the past for any effective services to be provided at the\ncommunity  level.  It  was  observed,  and  recounted  in  discussions,  that  community  participation\nhad been lacking in the process of developing appropriate water supply systems and sanitation\nfacilities. In a number of villages, where infrastructure such as WS&S existed, the residents did\nnot  know  which  agency  the  facilities  came  from.  This  resulted  in  lack  of  a  sense  of  ownership\nand  lack  of  a  motivation  for  the  community  to  manage,  operate,  or  maintain  the  facilities  and\nsystems.  When  technical  problems  arose,  the  community  took  no  action,  and  reverted  to  the\nprevious  methods  of  attaining  water  or  disposing  of  faeces.  This  situation  is  prevalent  in  the\nmajority of communities visited during the mission.\n\n11.\nThe  communities  have  a  very  limited  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  any  facilities,\nprimarily due to lack of funds, and also poor training, lack of technical support, and lack of simple\nmanuals,  tools,  and  repair  equipment.  The  use  of  inappropriate  technology  in  the  past  made\nmany systems difficult to maintain due to the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and the shortage\nof  qualified  and  experienced  technical  staff  to  undertake  the  repairs.  Some  systems  were  also\nvery expensive to operate and maintain due to the need for constant repair and replacement of\nparts  that  were  of  inferior  quality  or  where  poor  workmanship  and  quality  of  design  and/or\nconstruction had resulted in frequent breakage or failure. It is therefore especially important for\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\ncommunities  to  be  able  to  plan,  manage,  and  implement  their  own  development.  Systems  in\ncommunities  that  operate  and  maintain  their  own  facilities  are  more  likely  to  sustainable  than\nsystems that rely on government operation and maintenance (O&M).\n\nThe  success  of  any  development  project  involved  in  the  WS&S  sector  depends  on  the\n12.\neffective  participatory  involvement  of  the  community,  especially  at  the  earliest  stages  of\ncommunity  project  activities.  The  use  of  a  methodology  such  as  participatory  rural  appraisal\n(PRA)  is  effective  in  social  preparation,  problem  solving,  awareness  raising,  informing  choice\nand facilitating participation of the community at all stages. An important lesson of WSSRP-1 is\nthe  value  of  NGOs  in  facilitating  participatory  development.  Their  closeness  to  the  community\nhelps in participatory planning and community mobilization, which creates a sense of ownership\nand therefore extends sustainability. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to\nwater use, hygiene, and sanitation are essential to achieve improvements in community health\nand well-being. Community participation and social preparation are critical in promoting hygiene\nand sanitation. The installation of facilities such as water supply systems and latrines does not in\nitself  guarantee  improved  health  of  the  people.  The  focus  must  be  extended  to  the  proper\nutilization and management of WS&S.\n\n13. While the process of community participation within the WS&S sector is an ideal way to\nproceed,  in  East  Timor  the  current  situation  is  more  complicated.  A  Trust  Fund  for  East  Timor\n(TFET) World Bank Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project (CEP)1 is already\nunder way. Community WS&S activities are being implemented by NGOs including some under\nWSSRP-1. It is important to recognize that these programs may result in an inordinate time and\nresource  burden  on  recipient  community  members  who  are  still  struggling  to  rebuild  their  own\npersonal lives. It is important that WS&S programs do not exceed this capacity threshold.\n\n14.\nTherefore, all WS&S program components, while still utilizing a community participatory\nand ownership approach wherever possible, should take account of other community initiatives\nand a community\u2019s capacity to engage in such activities.\n\n2.\n\nGender\n\nThe role of women in most Timorese traditional systems,was severely restricted. But the\n15.\nsituation  has  changed  (para.  4).  Women  have  gained  new  skills  and  responsibilities,  and  are\nbeginning to move into traditionally male-dominated income-generating activities. It is imperative\nthat these newly acquired status and roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\n\n16. Women  are  major  contributors  to  household  income  by  marketing  agricultural  produce\nand  engaging  in  petty  trading  activities.  Women  report  they  have  a  say  in  decisions  about\nhousehold spending and have access to savings to spend as needed.\n\n17.\nAlthough  women  reported  fairly  evenly  divided  responsibilities  for  water  fetching,  it  was\ngenerally  acknowledged  that  they  bore  the  most  burden  and  responsibility,  as  men  were  often\nworking  elsewhere.  Most  rural  women  reported  times  in  excess  of  1  hour  a  day  for  water\ncarrying. Water was often not treated, due to lack of knowledge, time, or resources. In addition,\nwomen are the primary caregivers and are responsible for household work. They look after the\nhealth of family members and care for sick family members, further reducing time and energy for\nboth  productive  and  personal  activities.  It  is  therefore  women  who  are  in  most  need  of\n\n                  \n\n1 The CEP is a World Bank/ADB-managed, TFET-funded project that began in March 2000.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nassistance in reducing the time and effort required to obtain water supplies and to care for family\nmembers.\n\n18.\nFemale survey respondents reported frequent skin and genital inflammations, indicative\nof poor water quality and sanitation practices. Lack of water for washing was a recurrent theme.\nImplementation of community WS&S programs integrated with hygiene promotion activities will\nhelp  improve  the  situation.  It  will  give  women  more  time  to  pursue  other  opportunities,  and\nprovide  a  healthy  environment  for  themselves  and  their  families.  Any  WS&S  program  is\nexpected  to  work  in  conjunction  with  other  initiatives  in  community  development  and\nempowerment.\n\n19.\nImproving  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and  the  use  of  WS&S  facilities  by  improving\nknowledge,  attitudes,  and  practices  of  the  whole  community  will  positively  impact  on  women.\nThe  health  of  the  family  will  improve,  and  the  load  borne  by  women  as  caretakers  will\ncorrespondingly  reduce.  Due  to  their  traditional  roles  in  the  sector,  women  have  a  particular\nneed for improved access to and effective management and use of WS&S facilities.\n\n3.\n\nSustainability\n\n20.\nAt this early stage of reconstruction and development, it is difficult to say how the WS&S\nsector, can be sustainable. There will certainly be a need for aid and support for many years to\ncome. The strength and perseverance of the East Timorese throughout and following the conflict\nare amazing and will provide a sound foundation for their nation.\n\na.\n\nCommunity Ownership\n\n21. Within  the  WS&S  sector,  sustainability  will  be  different  between  the  urban  (public)  and\nthe rural (community) systems. However, a common element in achieving sustainability will be a\nstrong level of ownership of project activities by the target groups, whether through community\nmanagement in the rural areas or cost recovery in the urban areas. Issues of sustainability can\nbe addressed through adequate involvement of target groups and participants early on in project\nactivities.\n\nb.\n\nHealth and Hygiene Awareness\n\n22.\nAnother common element for sustainability is health and hygiene awareness in water use\nand  sanitation.  It  is  essential  that  the  community  gain  an  understanding  of  the  link  between\nwater,  and  sanitation  and  health  conditions  of  the  community.  The  recognized  importance  of\ndomestic  and  personal  hygiene,  proper  water  use,  and  appropriate  sanitation  will  encourage\ncommunities to change their habits. These changes will ensure that the people will sustain the\ndevelopments implemented within the Project, such as improved WS&S and water management\ngroups. An understanding of the importance of the changes to the health of the community will\nensure sustainability.\n\nc.\n\nInstitutions\n\n23. WSS  was  established  as  a  national  WS&S  organization  with  broad  responsibilities  for\nservice  delivery  in  the  sector.  It  is  expected  to  continue  and  develop  under  the  future\nindependent East Timorese Government. WSS must consider the sustainability of the institutions\nwithin the sector. Issues to consider include cost recovery, corporatization, and human resource\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\ncapability. These issues are being dealt with under WSSRP-1 and the Project will provide further\ncapacity-building support.\n\nd.\n\nCost Recovery\n\n24.\nIn the urban WS&S systems there will eventually be the need for recovery of operation\nand  maintenance  costs  if  systems  are  to  be  sustained.  In  the  urban  areas,  particularly  in  Dili,\nthere  is  a  decided  lack  of  community  management  in  an  everyday  utility  like  water  and\nsanitation, that is, it is taken for granted. Given this, it is essential that recipients be made aware\nof the price implications of the substantial investments and the operating costs involved. Aside\nfrom  sustaining  management  and  operations,  tariffs  also  encourage  users  to  utilize  a  resource\nmore effectively, further increasing the sustainability of the water resource itself.\n\ne.\n\nWillingness and Ability to Pay\n\n25.\nAn essential component of cost recovery is the community\u2019s willingness and ability to pay\nor to participate in management. Without regard for these two issues, sustainability through cost\nrecovery  cannot  be  achieved.  During  project  implementation,  assessing  affordability  and\nwillingness to pay through a survey is suggested as basis for the progressive introduction of cost\nrecovery objectives. As the economy progresses, the situation will change (in varying degrees)\nand WSS will need to monitor these changes to ensure the threshold is not breached.\n\nf.\n\nAppropriate Technology\n\nThe  importance  of  appropriate  technology  in  sustainability  cannot  be  overemphasized.\n26.\nProblems have been encountered with O&M in some of the emergency systems implemented by\nthe  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET)  and  NGOs.  By\nincorporating  technology  that  is  within  the  financial  capabilities  and  technical  capacities  of  the\ncommunity to manage, the extent to which the system will be sustainable will increase. Problems\nrelating to the lack of spare parts and repairs are also key concerns in the transfer of technology\nto  rural  communities.  Within  any  program,  provision  must  be  included  to  train  community\nmembers in the O&M of the facilities installed. In deciding appropriate technology mechanisms,\nthe  accessibility  of  spare  parts  must  be  considered.  In  relation  to  O&M,  encouraging  the\ncommunity  to  establish  financial  capabilities  to  sustain  ongoing  maintenance  and  repairs  must\nalso be considered. Appropriate technology also means use of the most cost-effective technical\nsolutions.\n\n4.\n\nUrban and Rural Groups\n\n27.\nFollowing the destruction, there has been a fear that rural groups will relocate to urban\nareas.  There  is  no  conclusive  evidence  to  support  this  now.  Conversely,  with  the  cessation  of\nIndonesian  rule  (and  their  relocation  policies),  both  urban  and  rural  populations  are  grappling\nwith  land  title  and  occupation  issues  that  impact  on  their  ability  to  recover  from  the  crisis.  In\nsome  cases,  original  landowners  are  reportedly  asking  families  to  relocate  to  their  traditional\nhomelands,  or  to  seek  opportunities  in  urban  areas.  Additionally,  town  and  district  borders  are\nbeing  redrawn,  families  are  still  returning,  and  there  are  sporadic  militia  activities  within  border\ndistricts.  Overall,  there  is  a  sense  of  change  that  is  still  affecting  people\u2019s  decisions  and\npractices, and will do so until some normality returns.\n\n28.\nIt is therefore important that all programs for urban and rural areas be seen as equitable.\nUrban  works  will  eventually  need  to  show  cost  recovery  because  of  the  greater  investment\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\nrequired.  This  cost  should  not  be  borne,  even  indirectly,  by  the  rural  population.  Community\nwater  supplies  may  never  be  wholly  economical;  however,  their  small  investment  costs,\ncombined  with  linkage  to  other  community  development  objectives  (such  as  self  management,\nempowerment, and community autonomy), may obviate the need for cost recovery. Additionally,\nwith  the  relocation  of  some  families  into  urban  areas,  and  the  development  of  improved  water\nand  sanitation  facilities  in  all  communities,  it  is  imperative  that  households'  knowledge  of\nappropriate water and hygienic practices be strengthened, so as to avert wastage and misuse,\nand maximize health benefits.\n\n5.\n\nNongovernment Organizations\n\n29.\nOver 150 international and local NGOs currently operate in East Timor. With their greater\nfinances and support, the international NGOs, while doing great work and often working closely\nwith local NGOs, are overshadowing the local organizations. On many occasions, local groups\nstated  that  they  wanted  to  have  more  involvement  and  autonomy  within  the  sector.  Indeed,  a\nmore dynamic and larger group of local NGOs would be an asset to the sector, and the WS&S\nlocal  NGOs'  establishment,  coordination,  development,  and\nprogram  should \nparticipation in the sector.\n\nfacilitate \n\n30.\nImplementation  of  WSSRP-1  used  international  and  local  NGOs  to  provide  a  range  of\nservices.  Further  engagement  of  NGOs  is  proposed  for  the  Project.  The  development  of  local\nNGOs  and  community-based  organizations  is  significantly  encouraged  by  a  range  of  donor\nprograms.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  in  particular  is\nproviding capacity-building support to local NGOs for WS&S activities through the NGO forum.\nThe intention is to build the local capacity of the East Timor NGOs to facilitate the sustainability\nof community WS&S work within the country.\n\n6.\n\nHealth\n\n31.\nPoor  health  conditions  related  to  WS&S  and  hygiene  practices  exist  widely  throughout\nEast Timor. While poor health in itself is a problem, high rates of morbidity adversely impact on\npoor  communities.  The  increased  burden  of  caring  for  sick  family  members,  as  well  as  a\nconsequent  reduction  in  productive  activities,  exacerbates  the  already  poor  socioeconomic\nstatus of the community.\n\n7.\n\nMinority Groups\n\n32.\nEast  Timor  has  no  identified  minority  groups.  Rural  communities  are  the  main\nbeneficiaries  of  the  water  and  sanitation  works,  especially  those  in  the  border  districts  that\nsuffered  and  continue  to  suffer  the  most  interruption  to  normal  activity.  The  Project  aims  to\nensure equity across districts, between genders, and between urban and rural communities.\n\n8.\n\nResettlement and Land Acquisition\n\nThe Project is not expected to require any resettlement based on existing service levels.\n33.\nWithin urban communities, there may be some land tenure and land acquisition issues that may\nrequire  careful  attention.  Mechanisms  for  dealing  with  land  access  issues  were  established\nduring  WSSRP-1  and  will  be  used  for  the  Project  if  required.  Where  public  land  was  not\navailable,  rights  of  access  and  use  for  a  period  of  (say)  50  years  were  negotiated  with  land\nowners.\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 10, page 7\n\n9.\n\nStakeholder Participation\n\n34.\nThe  Project  framework  was  developed  using  a  rapid  consultative  approach  consulting\nwith  key  stakeholders  particularly  within  the  UNTAET  administration.  The  Project  design  is\nflexible,  and  it  will  be  necessary  to  undertake  further  consultation  with  diverse  stakeholders  to\nfurther refine the detailed activities to be implemented. A process of community participation will\nbe part of the detailed planning and implementation of various project activities, managed either\nthrough  the  project  management  unit  or  through  the  participating  NGOs.  As  part  of  the\npreparation for WSSRP-1, many men and women, and various community and political groups\nat  national,  district,  and  community  levels  were  consulted.  Communities  and  both  formal  and\ninformal women\u2019s groups were consulted extensively throughout the field visits.\n\nIt is essential that communities, local NGOs, and women\u2019s groups be involved in project\n35.\ndesign,  implementation,  and  O&M  of  the  program  components.
