An initial environmental examination was undertaken.  \n\n \nThe Project will rehabilitate and expand the capacity of Avatiu port. The \nProject  comprises  (i)  widening  the  harbor  entrance,  (ii)  dredging  to \nincrease the depth alongside the wharf plus dredging and enlarging the \nship  turning  area,  and  (iii)  reconstructing  and  realigning  the  quay  and \nrepairing the adjacent wharf deck. \n \nIn 2007, the Government adopted the Preventive Infrastructure Master \nPlan  (IMP),  an  integral  part  of  the  National  Sustainable  Development \nPlan  2007\u20132010.  The  IMP  concluded  that  lack  of  investment  in \nmaintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  upgrading  of  basic  infrastructure  has \nresulted  in  aging  systems  that  do  not  provide  appropriate  levels  of \nservice to meet current demand and support sustained growth. \n \nAvatiu is the principal international port for the Cook Islands, as well as \nthe transshipment port for cargo to the second most populated island of \nAitutaki  and  the  less  populated  outer  islands.  The  country  is  heavily \nreliant on international imports by sea to support its tourism industry\u2014\nthe mainstay of the country\u2019s economy\u2014as well as for general imports \nand  exports.  Continued  efficient  operation  of  the  port,  its  security \nagainst periodic cyclone events, and its development to accommodate \nchanges in regional shipping methods are therefore critical to the Cook \nIslands\u2019 economy and the social well-being of its population. \n \nThe wharf is weak, aging, and vulnerable to damage from storms and \nimpact  from  vessels.  The  port  is  at  the  margin  of  safe  operations  for \ninternational  cargo  vessels  currently  serving \nIslands. \nMeanwhile,  longer,  deeper-draft,  and  more  efficient  cargo  vessels  are \nplanned for the Pacific Islands trade in the next few years. The existing \nvessels  will  be  removed  from  service.  The  larger  ships  cannot  be \nhandled  through  Avatiu  at  present,  due  to  limited  depth  alongside  the \nwharf  and  in  the  harbor,  berthing  length  limitations,  and  inadequate \nturning area within the harbor. The length limitation also prevents larger \ncruise  vessels  from  berthing  at  Avatiu,  thus  limiting  the  economic \nbenefit  to  be  gained  from  this  part  of  the  tourism  market.  Without  the \nProject,  there  will  be  escalating  costs  for  periodic  repair  of  the  wharf \nand  the  port\u2019s  use  will  need  to  be  restricted  to  only  smaller  vessels. \nCosts will be higher, and there will be adverse economic impacts. \n\nthe  Cook \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nThe impact will be continued economic growth and improved well-being \nof the population (the disadvantaged in particular). \nThe  outcome  will  be  a  secure  and  efficient  port  infrastructure  in \nRarotonga with constraints and safety risks removed. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  cost  is  estimated  at  $18.2  million  (NZ$27.2  million), \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.2 million (NZ$3.3 million).  \n \nADB will provide a blended loan of $15.5 million equivalent, comprising \n$8.6  million  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  $6.9  million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund (ADF) to finance 85.2% of the total \ncost  including  taxes  and  duties.  The  Government  will  provide  $2.7 \nmillion, or 14.8% of the total cost.  \n\nADB\u2019s $6.9 million loan from ADF will have a 32-year term with a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% during the balance of the loan term, equal amortization, and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft ADF loan and project \nagreements.  \n\nADB\u2019s  $8.6  million  loan  from  OCR  will  be  provided  under  its  lending \nfacility  based  on  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR).  The  loan \nwill have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other \nterms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. \n \nThe  Government  will  onlend  the  loans  through  subsidiary  loan \nagreements  to  the  Cook  Islands  Ports  Authority  on  terms  and \nconditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  currency  risk  of  the  loans  will  be \nborne by the Government. \n \nUntil 31 December 2012 \n \n30 April 2012 \n\n \nThe Cook Islands Ports Authority (CIPA) \n \nThe chief executive officer of CIPA will be the project director. CIPA will \nrecruit qualified and experienced staff for detailed design, construction \nsupervision, and financial administration of the Project and for ongoing \nmanagement  of  the  port  assets.  The  Board  of  the  Cook  Islands \nInvestment  Corporation  (CIIC)  will  be  the  steering  committee  for  the \nProject.  \n \nProcurement  of  civil  and  marine  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The works, involving \ndredging and reconstruction of the quay on a new alignment, will be in \na  one-contract  package  to  be  awarded  through  one-stage,  one-\nenvelope  international  competitive  bidding  with  prequalification.  The \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nin  port  engineering  and  contract  management, \n\nGovernment has asked ADB to approve advance action, conforming to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  for  recruiting \nconsultants,  prequalification,  inviting  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and \nlimited contract award. \n \nInternational and national consulting services will be required to support \nCIPA \nfinancial \nmanagement,  construction  supervision,  and  environmental  monitoring. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants. A total 92 person-months of consulting services \n(35  person-months  international  and  57  person-months  national)  have \nbeen budgeted for these purposes. An international consulting firm will \nbe  recruited  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  design  and \ncost  review,  detailed  design,  construction  contract  supervision,  and \nenvironmental monitoring.  \n \nThe  net  present  value  at  a  12%  discount  rate  is  $3.7  million,  and  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  15.9%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshows the Project to remain economically viable, with an EIRR of 12%, \nfor an increase in construction cost of 20% or a reduction in benefits of \n20%. The beneficiaries of the proposed Project are the end consumers \nof  food,  fuel,  materials,  and  other  goods  in  the  Cook  Islands  who  will \navoid  the  impact  of  steeply  rising  costs  associated  with  the  without-\nproject scenario. The poor and socially excluded will benefit from these \nlower  costs,  as  will  all  consumers,  but  the  poor\u2019s  benefit  as  a \npercentage of household income will be higher compared to most Cook \nIslanders.  The  increase  in  trade  and  new  port  users,  such  as  larger \ncruise  ships,  will  produce  secondary  benefits  by  boosting  retail  trade \nand tourism, thereby creating jobs among the local population.  \n \nThe Cook Islands are subject to extreme weather events, such as the \ncyclones  of  2005.  There  is  a  risk  of  damage  to  the  port  works  in \nprogress if a severe storm event were to occur at a critical time during \nthe  construction  period.  The  progressive  construction  method  for  the \nnew  quay  should  minimize  the  extent  of  works  being  exposed  to \ndamage risk at any one time, and all movable construction equipment \nwould  be  secured  ahead  of  an  approaching  storm.  In  addition,  the \nconstruction methodology will involve phasing of the quay construction \nto allow for uninterrupted port operations.  \nInstitutional  risks  lie  in  the  Government\u2019s  adequately  supporting \nimproved  oversight  of  the  maritime  sector  by  the  CIIC  and  public \nauditor,  and  in  the  CIPA\u2019s  fully  implementing  and  maintaining  an \neffective assets management plan over the 30-year life of the new port \ninfrastructure. \nto  a \nInadequate  asset  management  could \nshortening  of  the  service  life  and  reduction  in  the  economic  benefits \nand EIRR of the Project. These risks will be mitigated by ADB technical \nassistance  for  improving  infrastructure  services  delivery  and  asset \nmanagement. \n\nlead \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f159  55'Wo\n\no\n165  50'W\n\n159  50'Wo\n\nCOOK ISLANDS\nAVATIU PORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nAvatiu Port\n\nAVARUA\n\nRarotonga\nInternational Airport\n\nNikao\n\nArorangi\n\no\n21  30'S\n\nR A R O T O N G A\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n2\n9\n4\na\n \nE\nG\n\n159  55'Wo\n\nTitikaveka\n\n10  55'So\n\nPukapuka\n\nNassau\n\nRakahanga\n\nManihiki\n\nPenhryn\n\n10  55'So\n\nN     O     R     T     H     E     R     N              G     R     O    U     P\n\nSuwarrow\n\nS  O  U  T  H      P  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\n\nPalmerston\n\n18  55'So\n\nPROJECT AREA\n\nAitutaki\n\nManuae\n\n18  55'So\n\nTakutea\n\nMitiaro\n\nMauke\n\nAtiu\n\nAVARUA\n\nS     O     U     T     H     E     R     N\n G     R     O    U     P\n\nRAROTONGA\n\nMangaia\n\no\n165  50'W\n\n159  50'Wo\n\nMatavera\n\nNgatangiia\n\no\n21  30'S\n\nMotutapu\n\nOneroa\n\nKoromiri\n\nMuri\n\nTaakoka\n\nNational Capital\n\nLocality\n\nRoad\n\nReef\n\nN\n\n1\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n2\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\n\fCOOK ISLANDS\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF AVATIU PORT PROJECT\n\nM\n\nA\n\nI\n\nN\n\n \n\nR\n\nO\n\nA\n\nD\n\nWiden entrance\n channel\n\nRelocate rip-rap and slope breakwater\nhead and overtapping drainage channel\n\nWESTERN BASIN\n\nRelocate rip-rap\n\nLimit of Dredging\n\nRemove old\nsheet piling\n\nRemove existing\nwharf and apron\n\nNew Quay\nStructure\n\nRip-rap faced embankment\n\nDredge to\n\u20138.0mCD\n\n150.0000\n\nRemove existing Patrol\nboat landing and slipway\n\nNavigation Buoy\n\nCargo Shed\n\nRoad\n\nRehabilitate\ndomestic wharf\n\nPunanga Nui\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n2\n9\n4\nb\n \nE\nG\n\nRealign entrance\nlead light\n\nAVATIU ROAD\n\nM A I N   R O A D\n\nM\na\np\n \n2\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nto the Cook Islands for the Avatiu Port Development Project.  \n \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Cook  Islands  comprise  15  small  volcanic  islands  and  coral  atolls  with  a  total  land \narea  of  240  square kilometers,  spread  over  an  ocean  area  of  1.8  million  square kilometers.  A \nnorthern  group  of  islands  is  separated  from  the  southern  group  by  about  1,200  km.  The  total \npopulation is estimated at about 21,100.1 The principal island, Rarotonga, is only about 6 km in \ndiameter, and has a population of around 14,000. The second most populous island group is the \natoll  of  Aitutaki,  with  a  population  of  about  2,100  people.  The  balance  of  the  population  is \ndistributed among 11 of the remaining 13 islands. In addition to the resident population, tourists \nnumber around 3,000 at any one time, mostly on Aitutaki and Rarotonga. \n \n3. \nThe national economy has performed strongly in recent years. Growth in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) averaged 4.1% from 2004 to 2007, led by the private sector (particularly tourism \nand retail trade). Tourism is the most important economic driver and now contributes over 50% \nof  total  GDP.  Use  of  the  New  Zealand  dollar  (NZ$)  as  the  local  currency  helps  to  contain \ninflation.  The  average  annual  increase  in  the  consumer  price  index  was  2.6%  from  2004  to \n2007. \n \n4. \nThe  Cook  Islands  is  heavily  dependent  on  imports,  and  service  exports  from  tourism \nlargely cover the merchandise trade deficit. Pearls and fisheries are key merchandise exports, \nbut  these  contribute  just  0.8%  and  0.5%  of  GDP,  respectively.  Their  production  has  declined \nsignificantly in recent years due to disease in the pearl farms, intense market competition, and \ndepleted fish stocks.  \n \n5. \nTransport in the Cook Islands is well-developed. The gateway international airport is in \nRarotonga, with airstrips on several of the outer islands catering to domestic air traffic. The two \nmain  islands,  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  contain  64%  of  the  country\u2019s  road  network  of  392 \nkilometers  of  sealed  and  unsealed  roads  (in  the  outer  islands,  roads  are  almost  entirely \nunsealed). \n \n6. \nThe  Cook  Islands  port  infrastructure  comprises  two  international  ports\u2014at  Avatiu  near \nthe  main  town  of  Avarua  on  Rarotonga  and  at  Aitutaki\u2014plus  a  small  domestic  port  and  jetty \nfacilities  on  each  of  the  13  outer  islands.  The  latter  handle  interisland  traffic  only.  Avatiu  port \nhandles about 90% of total imports by sea, and Aitutaki accounts for the balance. International \ncargo  destined  for  the  outer  islands  is  transshipped  at  Avatiu.  The  volume  of  international \nexports  by  sea  is  minor  and  largely  comprised  of  fish.  The  ports  at  Avatiu  and  Aitutaki  are \noperated by the Cook Islands Ports Authority (CIPA), and the outer island ports are under the \njurisdiction of the Office of the Minister of Island Administration (OMIA) and the individual island \nadministrations.  OMIA  is  a  government  department  granted  an  annual  budget  allocation  to \nprovide essential services to the outer islands, including transportation, energy, and water. \n \nAvatiu  port  is  managed  by  CIPA.  CIPA  is  a  Crown-owned  statutory  corporation \n7. \nestablished  by  Parliament  under  the  Ports  Authority  Act  1995  to  provide  commercially \n\n                                                 \n1  Statistics Office. 2008. Social Statistics. Rarotonga. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsustainable port facilities and develop growth opportunities from the port assets, which include \nCrown  land  and  buildings,  wharves  and  marina,  port  facilities,  tugboats,  plant  and  equipment, \nstorage sheds, and hardstand areas. CIPA levies ports charges at both Rarotonga and Aitutaki, \nalthough the ports operations are under separate management. The newly rehabilitated marina \nat  Avatiu  Harbor  began  providing  revenue  to  CIPA  in  2008.  Cook  Islands  Investment \nCorporation (CIIC)2 presently collects the rent on land and buildings within the port area from a \nliquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  company  and  several  food  concessions.  These  rents  and  any \nrentals  from  future  concessions  will  accrue  to  CIPA  following  transfer  of  the  land  from  the \ncontrol of CIIC to CIPA in 2008. Stevedoring is outsourced to the private sector, but CIPA owns \nand operates the heavy forklift equipment in the container yard. \n \n8. \nCIPA  has  produced  deficits  for  4  out  of  the  last  5  years.  It  provides  approximately \nNZ$400,000 per year of free services under community service obligations, however, including \nberthing  for  interisland  shipping  and  the  Government\u2019s  patrol  boat,  storage  facilities,  and  a \nbuilding for the Maritime Surveillance and Marine Service at the Avatiu port. The port operations \nin  Aitutaki  are  not  commercially  viable  and  are  subsidized  from  CIPA\u2019s  Avatiu  port  revenues. \nInclusion into the accounts of this revenue forgone would allow CIPA to show a profit for those \nyears. In 2007, the management of CIPA changed with the resignation of the general manager \nand  the  chairman  of  the  board.  Following  the  appointment  of  new  board  members  and \nreplacement of the general manager, CIPA has adopted an enhanced commercial focus that is \nexpected  to  improve  its  performance  in  the  future  and  ensure  its  financial  sustainability.  CIPA \nkeeps comprehensive annual accounts that are produced and audited by outside auditors in a \ntimely manner. CIPA does not itself have professionally qualified accounting staff. Budgets are \nprepared  by  management  on  an  annual  basis  for  approval  by  the  board.  CIPA  does  not \ncurrently  have  a  business  plan  or  asset  management  plan,  nor  does  it  carry  out  multiyear \nbudgeting.  CIPA  controls  port  charges,  and  the  tariff  structure  was  recently  revised.  A  new \nstructure with an 8.5% increase in ship services and berthing tariffs will become effective from \nFY2009.  The  revised  tariffs  include  marine  service  charges,  tugboat  charges,  vessel  moves, \nberth hire, goods wharfage, equipment hire and demurrage, storage, and transport. These will \nresult in an anticipated increase in income of around 5% per year relative to application of the \nexisting  tariff  schedule  that  was  last  revised  in  August  2005.  The  revised  tariffs,  which  have \nbeen  increased  roughly  in  line  with  inflation,  will  provide  for  an  operating  profit  (including \ndepreciation  but  before  interest  and  tax)  equal  to  8%  of  average  fixed  assets,  which  is  an \nacceptable return on the assets employed. \n \n9. \nImports, comprising dry goods (containers, vehicles, break-bulk, and bulk items such as \ncement, timber, and other building materials) are transported by two vessels, one operated by \nReef  Shipping  and  the  other  by  the  Pacific  Forum  Line,  with  a  ship  in  port  at  Avatiu \napproximately every 10 days. Petroleum liquid fuels (automotive diesel, unleaded gasoline, and \njet A1) are delivered to Rarotonga about once a month and LPG about once every 2 months. \n \n10. \nThe  Avatiu  port  also  serves  tourism,  with  increasing  numbers  of  yachts  and  pleasure \nboats and especially passenger cruise ships. Calls by yachts increased from 113 in 2003 to 137 \nin 2007. Thirty-seven cruise ships visited Rarotonga in 2007 (54% more than in 2003), but very \nfew of them are able to berth at the quay. The cruise ships, most of which anchor outside the \nreef, are up to 200 meters (m) in length and passengers are generally brought ashore by tender \nfor  day  excursions.  Just  the  smallest  cruise  vessels  are  able  to  berth  at  the  quay.  Only  about \n40%  of  the  passengers  opt  to  come  ashore  if  use  of  a  tender  is  required,  whereas  90%  of \npassengers disembark when a vessel berths alongside. \n\n                                                 \n2  The  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  is  a  statutory  organization  established  as  a  holding  company  for  the \n\nGovernment\u2019s state-owned enterprises, including CIPA. \n\n\f11. \nVessels that use the wharf most frequently are local fishing vessels, averaging 5\u20137 calls \nper week with stays of a week or more, plus private yachts and tour boats. This small boat traffic \ncauses  some  congestion  in  the  harbor  at  busy  periods,  although  calls  by  local  and  foreign \nfishing vessels have fallen considerably since 2004 due to poor fishing conditions. Apart from a \nsmall  quantity  of  air  cargo,  all  overseas  imports  to  the  outer  islands  are  transshipped  through \nthe  port  of  Avatiu,  emphasizing  the  critical  lifeline  role  that  the  port  plays  in  the  national \neconomy. The number of vessels available for transporting passengers and cargo to the outer \nislands has recently been reduced to one, due to marine accidents, and the frequency of service \nis now reduced. \n  \n12. \nAitutaki  Harbor  comprises  the  Arutanga  Channel  leading  to  a  small  basin  and  finger \nquay. Ships cannot berth at the quay because of the limited channel depth and restricted basin \nspace.  A  lighter  operation  uses  two  old  barges  to  transfer  cargo  ashore.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment needs at Aitutaki are deepening and widening of the channel and basin, repairs to \nthe quay and pavements, upgraded navigation aids, and covered storage for plant and goods. \nThese major improvements are not economically viable, however, and do not form part of this \nproject. \n \n13. \nThe harbors in the outer islands typically comprise a channel cut through the reef flat to \na  small  basin  containing  a  dock  area  and  small  boat  ramp.  Some  harbors  have  concrete \nseawalls  to  provide  a  measure  of  protection  to  the  channel  and  basin.  Typically,  the  landing \narea  is  a  concrete  dock  and  small  hardstand.  Each  island  has  one  or  more  barges  or  large \ndinghies  for  transferring  cargoes  from  the  ship.  The  smallest  islands  have  no  harbor,  and  so \ngoods  and  passengers  must  be  ferried  to  the  reef  flat  or  landed  through  a  reef  channel  to  a \nbeach. No fees are levied by OMIA to users of outer island ports facilities.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure Constraints \n\n \n14. \nIn 2007, the Government adopted a 20-year Preventive Infrastructure Master Plan (IMP) \nthat was prepared under technical assistance (TA) from Asian Development Bank (ADB)3 as an \nintegral  part  of  the  National  Sustainable  Development  Plan  2007\u20132010  (NSDP). 4 The  IMP \nranked  infrastructure  development  projects  using  a  multi-criteria  analysis  and  recommended \npriority  investments  needed  for  sustainable  economic  growth  in  the  immediate,  medium,  and \nlong  terms.  The  IMP  also  assessed  the  condition  and  management  of  existing  infrastructure, \nconcluding that lack of investment in maintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading has resulted in \naging systems that do not provide appropriate levels of service for current demand and that this \nplaces  sustained  economic  development  at  risk.  Following  the  IMP,  ADB  funded  a  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) 5 for  preparing  an  infrastructure  development  project \n(IDP) with detailed feasibility studies for a number of priority infrastructure investments including \ntechnical,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  social,  and  poverty  assessments  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  policies and guidelines. The studies supported priority implementation for a 5-year \nIDP.  \n \n15. \nThe  PPTA  reviewed  the  status  of  the  physical  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  economic \nand social consequences of delay or inaction in rectifying critical deficiencies. The development \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2006.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n16. \nIn addition to the physical infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation needs, institutional \ncapacity constraints exist within some of the infrastructure agencies. These constraints impact \non  operations,  cost  recovery,  and,  consequently,  on  the  regularity  and  quality  of  basic \ninfrastructure service delivery. Institutional arrangements are fragmented, overlapping, and lack \ncoordination.  Thus,  there  are  management  weaknesses  and  a  lack  of  clear  ownership  of \npolicies,  planning,  and  regulatory  responsibility.  A  review  of  institutional  arrangements  and \ncapacity  was  undertaken  under  the  PPTA,  and  recommendations  for  an  infrastructure \ngovernance  framework  were  prepared.  The  Government  is  expected  to  adopt  these  in  2008. \nThe recommendations aimed to enhance management of existing and future infrastructure (with \na focus on projects to be constructed under the IDP and follow-on projects for the IMP\u2019s 20-year \nhorizon) while improving results-focused service delivery and asset management. \n \n17. \nThe  governance  framework  will  involve  improved  planning,  institutional  arrangements, \ncapacity  development,  policies,  and  arrangements  for  cost  recovery.  It  will  provide  (i)  rigorous \nplanning  and  investment  criteria  for  vetting  infrastructure  proposals;  (ii)  an  asset  management \nregime  that  includes  adequate  resource  allocations  for  asset  maintenance  and  asset \nmanagement plans that are subject to annual audit; and (iii) arrangements for ensuring sector \nsustainability, including institutional arrangements, through regular reviews of tariff regimes and \nprivate  sector  participation.  ADB  will  provide  separate  TA6 to  help  the  Government  implement \nthis  framework,  and  the  principal  benefits  to  the  current  project  will  accrue  through  improved \nasset management and institutional arrangements for tariff reviews. \n \n\n2. \n\nPort Sector Constraints \n\n \n18. \nThe Cook Islands is highly dependent on imports to meet its basic needs, as well as to \nretain competitiveness and encourage growth in tourism, its main industry. All international sea \ntrade (with the exception of a small proportion destined for Aitutaki, which receives containers \nand other cargoes directly from New Zealand) passes through Avatiu port on the main island of \nRarotonga.  All  domestic  cargo  destined  for  the  outer  islands  originates  from  Avatiu  port. \nTherefore,  the  Cook  Islands  economy  heavily  relies  on  the  continued  serviceability  and \nefficiency  of  the  port  to  guard  against  disruptions  to  import  flows  and  to  contain  sea  transport \ncosts. The Government recognizes that the primary mainstay of the economy is tourism, which \nrequires access to high quality and affordable imports for its survival and growth. \n \n19. \nThe  harbor  cannot  handle  ships  above  approximately  90  m  in  length,  and  the  berth  is \nlimited to a 6 m draft. That effectively excludes cargo vessels above 4,000 tons, and most cruise \nships  must  transfer  passengers  by  ship\u2019s  boat.  The  port  has  suffered  periodic  damage  from \ncyclones and emergency procedures are in place to minimize losses when cyclones occur. The \nexisting  wharf  was  constructed  in  1989.  It  is  in  a  state  of  advanced  deterioration,  due  to \ndeficiencies in the design and poor construction. The quay face and parts of the wharf deck are \nvulnerable to sudden failure, which could be triggered by storm or vessel impact. Such failures \nwill involve unplanned and increasingly expensive emergency repairs as the wharf continues to \ndeteriorate. Meanwhile, serviceability will be reduced and operating costs increased. In addition, \nthe width of the harbor entrance, size of the turning basin, and deteriorated surface of the port \nyard constrain efficient operations. Full reconstruction of the quay is urgently needed, along with \ndeepening  and  widening  of  the  harbor  to  accommodate  the  next  generation  of  cargo  vessels \n\n                                                 \n6  TA  funded  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund  for  improving  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  is  planned  for \n\nimplementation from 2009 until 2012. \n\n\fand larger cruise ships. Upgrading of the wharf could facilitate berthing at least 70% of all cruise \nships that currently call. A problems and constraints analysis is included in Appendix 2, and its \nmajor elements are summarized below: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe harbor entrance and turning basin. (a) Inadequate channel width for safe \nnavigation of ships; (b) navigation aids are generally limited to leading lights with \nlittle  delineation  of  the  entrance  channel;  and  (c)  insufficient  maneuvering  area \nwithin the harbor to turn ships, with the length of vessels restricted to 90 m.  \nQuay  structure.  (a)  Deterioration  of  the  cope  beam,  with  extensive  concrete \nspalling  and  corrosion  of  reinforcement  exacerbated  by  numerous  contacts  by \nberthing  ships;  (b)  gaps  between  the  concrete  sheet  piles,  cracked  and  broken \npiles  with  reinforcement  projecting  from  the  wall,  short  piles  not  driven  to \nsufficient  depth  to  meet  design  parameters;  (c)  inadequate  fenders  comprising \nlarge truck tires with little berthing energy absorption capacity and supplemented \nrecently by cylindrical fenders slung horizontally from the wharf (one of which has \nalready  been  damaged);  (d)  original  bollards  in  poor  condition  and  of  limited \ncapacity (approximately 20 tons), supplemented by new 100-ton bollards but with \nunknown foundation integrity; (e) reduced draft adjacent to the quay face due to \nconcrete  repairs  at  the  base  of  the  wall,  debris  on  the  seabed  that  includes \ndiscarded tire fenders, precast kerbs, and large boulders; and (f) corrosion of the \nwall  anchorage  steel  tie  bars,  and  particularly  the  quay  face  threads,  nuts,  and \nanchor plates. \nPort  container  handling  yard.  (a)  Areas  of  badly  cracked  concrete  pavement \nand gaps between slabs, and (b) voids that have opened under slabs adjacent to \nthe  quay  due  to  the  leaching  of  fines  (the  full  extent  of  which  will  not  become \nclear until the deck is removed and reconstructed). \nCapacity.  CIPA  lacks  capacity  for  (a)  financial  management,  and  (b)  asset \nmanagement.  A  qualified  accountant  is  needed  to  control  increasingly  complex \nfinancial  operations  as  the  port  increases  its  commercial  focus.  An  asset \nmanagement  engineer  is  required  to  exercise  tighter  control  and  pursue  better \nplanning of maintenance functions. \n\n \nIn addition to deterioration, the size of ship that can be berthed and turned safely within \n20. \nthe  harbor  is  limited.  The  port  presently  fails  to  meet  international  standards  for  the  safe \noperation  of  container  and  fuel  tanker  vessels.  Issues  include  inadequate  slip  clearance \ndistances between vessels and permanent structures, insufficient working load capacity of the \nmooring  bollards  due  to  weaknesses  in  the  wharf  structure,  an  inadequate  fendering  system, \nand  considerable  debris  and  concrete  rubble  below  the  waterline  and  on  the  harbor  floor  that \ndamage  the  hulls  of  large  vessels.  The  harbor  and  berths  limit  the  vessel  draft,  having  an \nuneven depth of about 6\u20137 m below chart datum, a confined turning basin (effective diameter of \nabout  120  m),  and  a  narrow  harbor  entrance  (about  100  m  width).  International  tanker  and \ncargo vessels that currently use the harbor are typically 86\u201390 m long, the maximum size that \ncan be handled by the port, and these are operating outside proper safety margins in terms of \nunderkeel clearance and turning room. The existing wharf is not straight over its length in plan, \nwith a change in angle (about 120 m from the harbor entrance) that both prevents long vessels \nfrom turning and constrains use of the berthing length. By 2011, longer and deeper draft vessels \nare expected to be employed by the international shipping industry for cargo deliveries to Pacific \nports. These will not be able to be accommodated at Avatiu. \n \n21. \nUpgrading  of  harbor  facilities  in  the  outer  islands  is  also  a  priority  under  the  NSDP. \nExisting  infrastructure  is  inadequate  for  efficient  transfer  of  goods  (including  containerized \naviation fuel) to shore. The Government is planning to repair and improve harbor facilities in the \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nouter  islands  with  its  own  financing  plus  financing  from  the  Cyclone  Recovery  and \nReconstruction  Program  of  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development  (NZAID). \nDesign and procurement for upgrading of the Mangaia, Mauke, and Mitiaro harbors is planned \nfor FY2009 under the Cyclone Recovery and Reconstruction Program, and the Government will \nconstruct a jetty and associated works at Nassau using its own resources. NZAID is expected to \ncontinue  with  its  support  for  development  of  outer  island  harbors  under  its  Outer  Islands \nDevelopment  Program.  Past  external  assistance  to  the  ports  and  maritime  sector  is  shown  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2008\u20132012 7  recognizes \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  continued  economic  growth  and  well-being  of  the \npopulation (particularly the disadvantaged). The Project aligns with government policy outlined \nin the NSDP. The Project addresses two key strategic goals of the NSDP: (i) an innovative and \nwell-managed  private  sector-led  economy;  and  (ii)  strengthened  and  affordable  basic \ninfrastructure,  transport,  and  utilities  to  support  national  development.  By  safeguarding  the \ncontinued  efficient  operations  and  expansion  of  the  port,  the  Project  will  ensure  that  facilities \nrequired  for  private  sector-led  economic  growth  are  strengthened  and  risks  to  operational \nefficiency are removed.  \n \n23. \nthat  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  depends  on  removing  the  binding  constraints  to  environmentally \nsustainable  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  improving  the  quality  of  public  sector \ngovernance. The strategic focus proposed for the partnership strategy is derived from the NSDP \nand  addresses  these  constraints  through  improved  economic  and  social  infrastructure  and \npublic sector service delivery. This directly supports implementation of the NSDP. \n \n24. \nThe  Project  will  address  existing  deficiencies  and  constraints  and  bring  the  port  and \nharbor up to acceptable international maritime safety standards by reconstructing the quay and \npart  of  the  wharf  area,  thus  extending  its  life  by  30  years,  and  by  increasing  the  harbor  and \nport\u2019s capacity for the current and larger vessels expected to call in the future. \n \n25. \nThe outcome of the Project will be a secure and efficient port infrastructure in Rarotonga \nwith  constraints  and  safety  risks  removed.  The  Project  will  enhance  safety  and  bring  ship \nberthing  and  maneuvering  within  the  harbor  more  closely  into  line  with  accepted  maritime \nindustry practice. At present, the operations of Avatiu Harbor are at the limits of safe operation \nfor the larger vessels using the port, and there is a risk that, as the port deteriorates, shipping \noperators may have difficulty in obtaining insurance and decide that they can no longer service \nthe Cook Islands with their existing or replacement vessels. \n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  also  widen  and  deepen  the  harbor  and  realign  the  quay  to  enable  the \nport to handle larger cargo ships, thereby ensuring that the port remains resilient in the face of \nchanging  international  conditions.  The  upgraded  port  will  also  be  able  to  safely  berth  larger \nsizes of cruise ships (that are equipped with bow thrusters8) that cannot presently enter Avatiu \nHarbor. The Project will stabilize the cost of port services and of imported goods to consumers, \nallowing for surety and predictability while stimulating economic growth. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy. Cook Islands (2008\u20132012). Manila. \n8  A bow thruster is a propulsion device built in to the bow of a ship to enhance its maneuverability. \n\n\fB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  physical  outputs  of  the  Project  are:  (i)  harbor  dredged  to  8  m  below  chart  datum \n27. \n(from the current depth of about 6 m), (ii) widened harbor entrance (by approximately 10 m), (iii) \ndemolition  of  the  outer  and  inner  berths  and  replacement  of  them  by  a  continuous  quay  (total \nstraight wharf face of 270 m), (iv) new sheet piling along the new quay wall, (v) rehabilitation of \nthe wharf deck back to 20 m from the wharf face, (vi) demolition of the old slip and patrol boat \nwharf  and  facing  the  embankment  with  riprap,  (vii)  providing  protection  to  the  northern  end  of \nthe quay by repositioning riprap at the western end of the breakwater, (viii) rearrangement of the \npetroleum-products  pipe  and  hazardous  materials  area,  (ix)  rehabilitated  south  (domestic) \nwharf,  and  (x)  relocated  cargo  storage  sheds.  The  proposed  development  of  Avatiu  port  is \nshown on the outline concept drawing (Map 2). \n \nExisting seabed depths within the harbor generally vary from 4.0 m to 6.0 m below chart \n28. \ndatum. For larger ships with drafts from 7.0  m to 7.5 m, a  dredge depth of 8.0  m  below chart \ndatum is proposed within the harbor. Incorporated in the scope of the dredging will be widening \nof the entrance channel on its western side to create a channel at least 100 m wide. This will \ninvolve  the  removal  of  an  old  sheet  pile  wall  and  repositioning  of  riprap  on  the  reef  flat  at  the \nentrance to CIPA\u2019s western marina development. Additional navigation aids will be provided at \nthe seaward end of the entrance channel. \n \n29. \nTo service larger cargo ships (up to 120 m in length) that will serve the port in the future, \na  maneuvering  area  of  some  150  m  diameter  is  required.  To  achieve  this,  the  existing  patrol \nberth,  an  adjacent  disused  slipway,  an  existing  government  building  housing  a  Department  of \nMarine  Resources  store,  and  a  fast  food  outlet  will  be  demolished.  The  resulting  sloping \nembankment will be faced with riprap armor to protect against wave action. \n \n30. \nThe main wharf will be replaced by a new, realigned, and continuous sheet piled quay \nstructure 270 m long. To allow continuing port operations during the construction period, some \n110  m  of  the  outer  end  of  the  existing  international  wharf will  remain available  while  the inner \nsection  of  the  quay  is  constructed  on  its  new  alignment.  Once  this  is  operational,  the  outer \nsection will be demolished in turn and the remainder of the wharf constructed. The quay will be \nfitted with appropriate fenders and  100-ton capacity bollards. To provide working space during \nconstruction and an improved working yard area for the new quay, an existing cargo shed will \nbe demolished and a new structure will be provided. As part of the quay construction, a new 20 \nm  wide  concrete  working  apron  will  be  constructed  to  levels  that  tie  in  with  the  existing \npavement levels and replacing the existing cracked and broken slab. Fuel supply pipelines will \nbe relocated by the operators in conjunction with the construction contract. The protective riprap \nand  the  adjacent  wave  overtopping  drainage  channel  at  the  western  end  of  the  northern \nbreakwater will be repositioned to provide full-depth access at the northern end of the quay. \n \n31. \nThe  section  of  existing  wharf  on  the  south  of  the  harbor  basin  (generally  used  for \ndomestic shipping and visiting yachts) is in relatively better condition than the section used for \ninternational shipping. The cope beam will be replaced and the bollards and fenders upgraded. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  climate-proof  the  wharf  by  replacing  the  existing  structure  that  is \nextremely  vulnerable  to  wave  action  and  forces  with  one  that  is  fully  resistant  to  such  forces. \nAdditionally, the wharf will be designed such that it can be raised along with the container yard \nat some future date, should a rising sea level require it. Similarly, the design of the anchorage \npoints for the fendering system will allow the fenders to be set at a higher level if required.  \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSpecial Features \n\nAsset  Management. \n\nC. \n \n33. \nDonor Harmonization. The Project has been developed as a priority component of the \nIMP.  Implementation  of  other  priority  components  is  required  to  maximize  developmental \nimpacts.  Other  development  partners,  including  NZAID  and  the  European  Union,  have \nsubscribed  to  the  need  for  rational  prioritization  among  competing  infrastructure  development \nneeds  that  are  within  the  absorptive  capacity  of  institutions  and  the  borrowing  capacity  of  the \nGovernment,  and  they  will  integrate  their  assistance  within  the  IDP.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina has expressed interest in supporting priority components of the IDP with grant money or \nconcessional  loans.  To  build  on  this,  an  infrastructure  partnership  framework  is  being \ndeveloped,  initially  between  the  Government,  ADB,  NZAID,  and  the  European  Union.  The \nframework will set out the expected contributions of all the parties toward implementing the IDP \nand for supporting capacity development. \n \n34. \nthe \ngovernment-owned  infrastructure  sector  in  the  Cook  Islands,  and  the  port  sector  is  no \nexception.  Accounting  and  financial  management  are  weak,  due  to  inadequate  staff  skills  and \nqualifications. Much of the observed weakness relates to inadequate public sector oversight of \ninfrastructure service operations plus lack of a coordinated asset management and monitoring \nsystem.  ADB  TA,  to  be  implemented  over  4  years  concomitant  with  the  construction  period  of \nthe Project, is planned. Under a TA grant, it will improve infrastructure governance, establish a \nmechanism  for  public  sector  oversight  and  monitoring  of  infrastructure  services,  and  build \ncapacity within service provider institutions (including CIPA) to carry out appropriate asset and \nfinancial management functions. \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $18.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.2  million.

A  debt \n40. \nsustainability analysis carried out by ADB in April 2007 and updated debt projections prepared \nin August 2008 conclude that the additional borrowing required for the port is sustainable. The \nproposed ADB loan for the port, a loan recently secured from the People\u2019s Republic of China for \ngovernment buildings and sports facilities, and a proposed loan from the European Investment \nBank for energy and airport investments are projected to raise the ratio of net government debt \nto GDP to about 25%. Debt servicing costs are projected to peak at 3% of revenue and remain \nbelow  5%  of  exports  of  goods  and  services.  Such  debt  indicators  are  substantially  below \nrelevant debt thresholds. Debt indicators would remain comfortably within threshold levels even \nif there were no growth in GDP or exports of goods and services and if revenue generated by \nthe loan projects were to fall below projections. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The  country  cost-sharing  ceiling  is  up  to  99%  for  lending  and  nonlending  products.  Taxes  and  duties  will  be \n\nfinanced by ADB. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nCIPA  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  Under  the  direction  of  its  chief \n41. \nexecutive,  who  shall  be  the  project  director,  a  project  office  will  be  established  within  CIPA. \nCIPA  will  strengthen  its  administrative  capacity  to  cater  for  the  Project\u2019s  ongoing  operations, \nincluding  management  of  port  assets.  At  a  minimum,  additional  staff  to  be  recruited  to \npermanent  positions  within  CIPA  will  comprise  a  professionally  qualified  chief  financial  officer \n(CFO) and a port asset management engineer. The chief executive, chief financial officer, and \nport asset management engineer will form the project management team, which will have core \nresponsibility for the oversight and financial administration of the Project. \n \nThe board of the CIIC will be the steering committee for the Project. The chief executive \n42. \nof  CIPA  will  present  reports  on  the  Project\u2019s  technical  and  financial  progress  to  the  regular \nmeetings of the CIIC board, and to such special meetings as that board shall deem necessary. \nAs  the steering  committee,  the  CIIC  board  will  review  progress  and  will  keep  the  Government \ncognizant  of  any  issues  or  concerns,  as  well  as  the  remedial  action  proposed  in  relation  to \nthese.  The  CIIC  board  will  also  ensure  that  the  interests  of  stakeholders  are  respected  and \nappropriately catered for during the port construction activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n43. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  37  months,  from  May  2009  to  May  2012.  The \npreconstruction  activities  such  as  the  design  review,  the  preparation  of  prequalification  and \nbidding  documents,  and  the  tendering  and  award  of  the  contract  will  begin  in  May  2009. \nInvitations to bid will be issued to prequalified bidders by November 2009. The civil works for the \nport  facilities  are  expected  to  start  in  June  2010  and  be  completed  by  April  2012.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n44. \nAll  procurement  for  works  under  the  ADB,  ADF,  and  OCR  loans  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  procurement  will  consist \nmainly  of  civil  works  to  increase  the  operating  life  and  capacity  of  Avatiu  port.  A  procurement \nplan is in Appendix 6. \n \n45. \nThe  civil  works,  involving  reconstruction  and  realignment  of  the  international  quay  and \npart  of  the  wharf  deck,  widening  of  the  harbor  entrance,  and  dredging  to  increase  the  depth \nalongside  the  berths  and  ship  turning  area,  will  be  grouped  into  one  contract  package  and \ntendered  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocurement in a single contract package is proposed so as to attract international bidders and \nto  reduce  administrative  pressure  on  the  executing  agency.  International  contractors  will  be \nencouraged  to  subcontract  packages  of  work  to  the  national  construction  industry  where \ncapability  and  capacity  exist  and  can  be  efficiently  employed.  Procurement  will  follow  a  single \nstage, one-envelope international bidding process with prequalification. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n46. \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  engaging  consultants  to  support  the  project  management \nteam  in  (i)  reviewing  the  design  concepts,  plans,  and  documents  for  the  port  improvements \ncompleted during the PPTA in consultation with CIPA; (ii) preparing the detailed design of the \n\n \n\n\fproposed  port  improvements  and  recomputing  the  cost  estimates  and  the  economic  and \nfinancial analysis to confirm project viability and affordability; (iii) preparing a system for project \nperformance monitoring acceptable to ADB for the performance targets and key indicators in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework,  including  collection  and  reporting  of  baseline  project \nperformance  monitoring  information;  (iv)  compiling  the  contract  documents  and  specifications; \n(v)  in  consultation  with  CIPA,  conducting  the  prequalification  of  bidders;  (vi)  preparing  bidding \ndocuments  that  recognize  the  need  to  maintain  port  operations  throughout  construction;  (vii) \nhandling the bidding process; (viii) evaluating the bids received and preparing a bid evaluation \nreport and recommendation to CIPA and CIIC on contract award; (ix) assisting CIPA and CIIC in \nexecuting  the  contract;  (x)  managing  and  supervising  the  construction  contract;  and  (xi) \nproviding environmental and social monitoring and management services over the course of the \nProject. \n \nA total of about 92 person-months of consulting services will be required comprising 35 \n47. \nperson-months  of  international  and  57  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  All \nconsulting  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod. A ratio of 80:20 will apply to quality and cost, respectively. Outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 7. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n48. \nThe Project is both revenue-generating and critical to ensuring the continuing operations \nof the existing facilities. As time is critical to the financial and economic viability of the Project, \nthe  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  for  recruiting  consultants  and \nprocuring  civil  works.  Advance  action  covers  prequalification,  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid \nevaluation, and limited contract award. The advance action will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the advance action, if granted, does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n49. \nTo meet the implementation schedule, preconstruction activities must start in 2008. The \nProject will provide retroactive financing for project management, including consulting services. \nRetroactive  financing  will  be  permitted  only  if  (i)  it  is  specifically  agreed  by  ADB  and  the \nBorrower in the loan agreement and only pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement; (ii) \nthe  goods,  works,  services,  and  consultants  for  which  it  is  requested  are  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants; and \n(iii)  the  amount  to  be  retroactively  financed  does  not  exceed  5%  from  the  OCR  loan  and  5% \nform the ADF loan respectively. The expenditures must have been incurred before effectiveness \nof the loan, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing date of such loan agreement. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n50. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  CIPA,  and  CIIC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f7. \n\nGrievance and Redress Mechanism \n\n \n51. \nA complaint and problem management procedure will be established under the Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Economic  Management  to  (i)  review  and  address  grievances  of  project \nstakeholders  in  relation  to  either  the  Project,  any  of  the  service  providers,  or  any  person \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  the  Project;  and  (ii)  set  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for \nhandling such grievances, for proactively responding to them, and for providing the stakeholders \nwith notice of the chosen mechanism or action. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n52. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  form  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for \nthe civil works contract and consulting services. CIPA will establish an imprest account, for the \nADF loan only, at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with an initial advance equivalent to \nestimated  eligible  project  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  to  be  paid  through  the  imprest \naccount  or  $50,000,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed, \nliquidated,  and  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the \nimprest account for individual payments of $25,000 and below. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n53. \nCIPA  will  make  arrangements  that  are  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  reporting  progress  on \nproject  implementation.  CIPA  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  concerning \npreconstruction  activities  and  construction  of  all  civil  works,  including  physical  and  financial \nprogress;  status  of  environmental  management  and \ninstitutional  development;  asset \nmanagement;  financial  administration  and  forward  budgeting;  institutional  capacity  building; \npublic  communications;  and  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation.  To  facilitate \nperformance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  will  provide  ADB,  within  3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of \nthe  Project,  a  completion  report  covering  project \nimplementation details, costs and benefits, and any other information that may be  required by \nADB. In addition, CIPA will establish a website within 2 months of loan effectiveness for public \ndissemination of project information and periodic project reports. \n \nCIPA will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project that identify the goods \n54. \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan,  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  use  of \ncounterpart funds. The project accounts will be established and maintained in accordance with \nsound  accounting  principles  and  practices  that  will  follow  internationally  accepted  accounting \nstandards.  The  project  accounts  and  annual  financial  statements  will  be  subject  to  annual \nexternal audit by auditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial covenants included in \nthe loan and project agreements. A separate opinion will be provided on the use of the imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedures. The Government  will provide ADB with the \nannual  audited  financial statements, audited  project  accounts,  audit  reports,  and  management \nletters and other related statements in English, and no later than 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal  year  for  the  entire  implementation  period.  ADB  will  issue  a  formal  warning  for  accounts \nmore  than  6  months  overdue  and  will  suspend  the  disbursement  for  accounts  that  are  12 \nmonths overdue. \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n55.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, and with TA provided by the detailed design and \nconstruction  supervision  consultants,  CIPA  will  agree  with  ADB  a  system  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating the performance of the Project in relation to its expected impact and outcomes as set \nout  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  CIPA  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s \nprogress annually throughout construction, and it shall prepare annual reports to ADB within 3 \nmonths of the end of each calendar year. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n56. \nADB, the Government, and CIPA will undertake semiannual and midterm reviews of the \nProject  to  consider  (i)  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants,  (ii)  physical  achievements  against \nmilestones,  (iii)  loan  disbursements  and  financial  progress,  and  (iv)  project  implementation \nissues requiring resolution or action. The midterm review shall be undertaken within 15 months \nof the loan effectiveness date. At the midterm review, the Government and ADB will review in \ndetail  the  project  design  and  implementation  progress  to  identify  areas  for  strengthening  and \nimprovement  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  and  achievement  of  the  project  objectives.  All \nassumptions and risks noted in the design and monitoring framework will be reviewed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefit \n\n \nA. \n \n57. \nThe economic analysis (Appendix 8) compares with- and without-project scenarios. The \nassessment  covers  the  period  2009\u20132036  and  assumes  a  construction  period  of  2.5  years \nstarting in the second half of 2009. All benefits and costs are in constant 2008 prices. \n \nIn the without-project scenario, it is expected that international cargo deliveries through \n58. \nAvatiu  Harbor  in  the  near-  and  long-term  future  will  be  subject  to  steeply  rising  costs  in \ncomparison with current costs, and for three reasons: (i) continued reliance on 4,000-ton (85\u201390 \nm)  vessels  within  the  confines  of  the  existing  harbor  basin  will  require  replacing  the  existing, \naging vessels (to be retired in the next 5 years) with new custom-built vessels at a much higher \ncost per ton than previously, since vessels of this class are no longer a mainstream line of the \ninternational  shipbuilding  industry;  (ii)  continued  unchecked  deterioration  of  the  existing  wharf \nstructure will, in the near term, raise risks to commercial shippers (and their insurers) and cause \nthem  to  suspend  deliveries  to  Avatiu,  forcing  the  government  to  charter  small  vessels  (and \ninsure them at premium rates) to provide for continued deliveries at significantly higher cost than \ncommercial shipping rates; and (iii) continued deterioration will bring rising costs for emergency \nrepairs,  which  will  be  passed  on  in  the  form  of  higher  port  charges.  In  the  without-project \nscenario,  all  of  these  increases  would  be  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  higher \nwholesale  and  retail  prices.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  on  the  other  hand,  new  and  larger \n\u201cmainstream\u201d  vessels  may  be  accommodated  in  the  harbor,  thereby  containing  commercial \nshipping  costs  and  avoiding  the  costs  of  government  charters,  and  avoiding  the  costs  of \nemergency repairs to the wharf. \n \n59. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  port  redevelopment  are  (i)  capital  cost,  including  labor, \nequipment  and  materials,  consulting  services,  and  physical  contingency;  and  (ii)  maintenance \ncost. In comparing the with-project and without-project scenarios, the economic benefits of the \nProject arise from (i) savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs (i.e., in vessel capital cost and fuel \nand  other  operating  costs),  (ii)  additional  earnings  from  tourism  due  to  increased  berthing  of \npassenger cruise vessels in the harbor, and (iii) avoided costs of frequent emergency repairs to \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fFinancial Benefit \n\nthe  present  port  to  keep  it  operating  without  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  have  other \nbenefits, such as supporting the delivery of essential social services and minimizing the cost of \nconsumer goods, most of which are imported and nearly all of which enter the country through \nthe  Avatiu  Harbor.  These  additional  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify  and  are  therefore  not \nincluded in the economic assessment. \n \n60. \nAt a 12% discount rate, the Project is economically viable. The net present value (NPV) \nis  about  $3.7  million  (NZ$5.5  million)  and  the economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  about \n15.9%.  The  savings  in  cargo  and  fuel  delivery  costs  as  well  as  income  from  additional  cruise \nships  berthing  at  the  wharf  are  important  benefits.  Another  key  benefit  is  the  savings  in \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  port  from  refurbishing  its  structure,  extending  its  life  by  30 \nyears,  and  avoiding  the  necessity  of  frequent  emergency  repairs  to  keep  it  in  operation.  The \nProject  will  enable  the  port  to  handle  increasing  volumes  of  cargo  efficiently,  whereas  without \nthe  Project,  the  port  would  not  be  able  to  increase  throughput  and  could  continue  to  handle \npresent volumes only with difficulty\u2014and at increasing cost. \n \nThe EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \n61. \nchanges  in  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  Project.  The \nsensitivity analysis showed the Project to be economically viable with a 20% increase in costs or \na 20% decrease in all benefits. \n \n62. \nA distribution analysis (presented in Appendix 8) concludes that the economic benefits of \nthe Project accrue chiefly to consumers in the form of cargo and fuel delivery cost savings, but \nalso to the Government and economy in the forms of taxes and additional tourism earnings. \n \nB. \n \n63. \nA  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  Project\u2019s  viability  and  sustainability. \nRevenues  and  tariffs  were  analyzed  to  year  2025  to  assess  income  from  the  port  operations. \nThe  analysis  confirms  CIPA\u2019s  ability  to  boost  income  through  sustainable  port  operations  that \ngrow in line with the anticipated increases in goods and traffic handled by the port. It shows, too, \nthat CIPA will be able to achieve an appropriate pretax return on equity over the analysis period. \n \n64. \nFinancial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  CIPA  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects \n(2005) to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the Project. The financial evaluation \nwas undertaken in real terms using constant 2008 prices. Incremental costs and benefits were \nderived under with- and without-project scenarios. \n \n65. \nThe  after-tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  Project  is  6.0%,  which \ncompares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 1.23%. The financial \nnet  present  value  (FNPV)  is  NZ$19.1  million  ($12.8  million).  The  results  of  the  sensitivity \nanalyses  (20%  reduction  in  operating  revenues,  20%  increase  in  project  costs,  and  20% \nincrease  in  port  operating  costs)  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability. \nDetails of the financial evaluation are in Appendix 9. \n \nC. \n \n66. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  Environmental  Category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and the Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Accordingly, \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  the  proposed  Project \n(Supplementary Appendix B) and a summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix C. The Project \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fwill  also  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements  as  specified  in  the \nEnvironmental  Act  2003,  and  thus  an  environmental  assessment  will  be  reviewed  by  the \nNational Environment Service (NES) and prior consent from NES will be obtained. \n \n67. \nPotential impacts are mainly those associated with construction, particularly dredging of \n107,000 cubic meters (m3) of bottom sediment and 25,000 m3 of concrete rubble. Six samples \nof dredged materials taken from the proposed dredging area showed that they consist mostly of \nsands  and  coral  rubbles,  and  the  silt  content  is  only  2%.  Chemical  analysis  of  the  dredged \nsediment has confirmed the absence of toxic or otherwise harmful levels of contaminants that \nwould have required special consideration when selecting disposal sites. Environmental impacts \nof  dredging  will  be  mitigated  by  means  of  (i)  a  detailed  dredging  program,  with  proper \nsequencing of activities; (ii) use of a silt curtain; and (iii) staging and drying of spoil on-site, and \nstockpiling  of  spoil  at  the  contractor\u2019s  quarry.  About  10%  of  the  material  will  be  used  for \nconstruction  on-site,  and  the  rest  will  be  utilized  off-site  or  disposed  of  in  landfill  areas.  In \nprevious dredging activities, there was high demand for sand and rubble that resulted in sales to \nthe public as aggregate, fill, or soak pit material. \n \n68. \nOverall, the IEE predicted insignificant environmental impacts of the Project because of \nthe following: (i) the Project will be undertaken within the footprint of the existing harbor and port \noperations, (ii) there are no sensitive habitats in the vicinity of the harbor, and (iii) the harbor has \nin  fact  undergone  previous  projects  of  a  similar  nature  (blasting,  dredging,  and  wharf \nconstruction) without significant environmental impacts (i.e., in 1980, there were dredged about \n200,000  m3  and  in  2003  about  50,000  m3  mainly  consisting  of  reef  materials  comprising  coral \nboulders,  gravel,  and  coarse  sand).  This  material  was  used  to  create  the  current  port  facility \n(reclaimed  land)  east  of  the  harbor,  and  also  some  of  the  reclaimed  land  in  the  Punanga  Nui \nMarket  area  east  of  the  port  area  (to  create  ramps  up  to  the  main  road  and  parking  areas  in \nbetween the road and the wharves). \n \nThe  IEE  provides  for  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  EMP  will  be \n69. \nrefined  during  detailed  design,  reflected  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  included  in  the \ncontractors\u2019  contracts  for  the  Project.  The  contractors  will  be  guided  by  the  EMP  in  managing \nenvironmental  impacts.  A  monitoring  plan  has  been  prepared  to  monitor  key  environmental \naspects, and it will provide feedback to the EMP as necessary.  \n \nD. \n \n70. \nThe initial beneficiaries of lower costs from the proposed Project in comparison with the \nwithout-project scenario (para. 58) are private and public sector consumers in the Cook Islands, \nas they will avoid the impact of the steeply rising delivery costs that are expected if the harbor is \nallowed to continue deteriorating. The proposed project will result in avoiding increased costs of \nfood,  fuel,  and  goods  to  consumers  that  would  arise  on  account  of  increased  freight  charges \noccurring  in  the  without-project  scenario.  Therefore,  savings  in  cargo  and  fuel  delivery  costs \n(comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios)  will  be  retained  by  ultimate \nconsumers  of  goods  and  fuel  in  the  Cook  Islands  and  not  by  shippers.  The  poor  and  socially \nexcluded  will  benefit  from  these  cost  savings,  like  all  other  consumers,  but  the  benefit,  as  a \npercentage  of  household  income,  will  be  higher  for  them  compared  to  most  Cook  Islanders. \nSecondary benefits of the Project, including economic spinoffs from new users of the port (such \nas  cruise  ships)  leading  to  increased  retail  trade,  should  also  percolate  through  the  local \npopulation in Rarotonga. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \n\nGender Impacts \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\nE. \n \n71. \nResettlement impacts are limited and can be mitigated. They include (i) the relocation of \ngoods from within a customs warehouse leased by Excil Shipping to another warehouse to be \nlocated  nearby  on-site,  and  (ii)  the  relocation  of  a  small  fish  restaurant  business  presently \ncarried  out  in  leased  premises  on  port  land  opposite  the  wharf.  The  restaurant  will  be \nreestablished  in  a  similar  location  off-site.  Compensation  will  include  lost  profit  and  support  of \nstaff  salaries.  There  have  been  consultations  with  the  affected  businesses,  and  initial \nagreements  on  relocation  costs  and  compensation  payable  have  been  reached.  Resettlement \nactions  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement  plan  is  in  Appendix  11  and  the  complete  short  resettlement  plan  is  contained  in \nSupplementary Annex D. All costs associated with resettlement will be financed by CIPA. There \nare no indigenous people or ethnic minorities within the Project\u2019s zone of influence. \n \nF. \n \n72. \nThere are no gender issues or specific opportunities for gender equality associated with \nthe  proposed  Project,  given  its  very  limited  focus  on  construction  and dredging.  Nevertheless, \nthe  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  pervasive,  benefiting  all  segments  of  the  Cook  Islands \npopulation including women, men, youth, and disadvantaged groups. \n \nG. \n \n73. \nTechnical risks lie in (i) continuity of port operations during construction, (ii) damage to \nthe new quay structure and to engineering plant in the event of a severe storm event occurring \nat critical times during the construction period, and (iii) the unknown extent of fill erosion below \nthe  wharf  deck  and  need  for  repair.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  as  follows:  (i)  the  design \nprovides  for  half  of  the  quay  length  to  be  available  for  shipping  while  the  other  half  is  under \nconstruction, (but some minor delays to commercial shipping cannot be entirely discounted); (ii) \nfishing boats and visiting yachts will be required to use the newly rehabilitated adjacent marina, \nowned and controlled by CIPA, while construction is underway; (iii) conservative estimates have \nbeen made of the extent and cost of any subsurface repairs in estimating the total cost of the \nwork; and (iv) the progressive construction method for the new quay should minimize the extent \nof  works  exposed  to  damage  risk  at  any  one  time,  and  all  movable  construction  equipment \nwould  be  secured  ahead  of  an  approaching  storm.  The  extent  of  fill  erosion  beneath  the \nconcrete slab wharf deck, particularly the sections adjacent to the quay, will not be known until \nthe existing concrete deck slab has been removed. \n \n74. \nInstitutional  risks  lie  in  the  Government\u2019s  adequately  supporting  improved  oversight  of \nthe  maritime  sector  by  the  CIIC  and  public  auditor,  and  in  the  CIPA\u2019s  fully  implementing  and \nmaintaining  an  effective  asset  management  plan  over  the  30-year  life  of  the  new  port \ninfrastructure. Inadequate asset management could lead to a shortening of the service life and \nreduction in the economic benefits and EIRR of the Project. These risks will be mitigated by (i) \nthe  separate  ADB  TA  for  improving  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  and  asset \nmanagement  in  general,  and  (ii)  inclusion  of  specific  assurances  for  the  recruitment  by  CIPA \nand training of a ports asset management engineer. \n \n75. \nFinancial  risks  lie  in  the  management  effectiveness  and  financial  control  exercised  by \nCIPA  over  its  port  operating  costs,  as  well  as  in  setting  levels  of  port  charges  to  adequately \nrecover these costs and to meet CIPA\u2019s debt service and Government dividend obligations. In \nthe  event  that  CIPA  would  fail  to  operate  profitably,  the  burden  of  debt  servicing  would  be \npassed back to the Government to fund from general revenue. Mitigating the financial risks will \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fbe the support to the maritime sector for strengthening asset management under the separate \nADB  TA  and  during  the  construction  phase  through  the  consultants\u2019  services  for  construction \nsupervision,  as  well  as  assurances  regarding  the  appointment  of  a  full-time,  suitably  qualified \nchief financial officer to the CIPA executive. \n \nEconomic  risks  lie  in  (i)  the  ongoing  competitiveness  of  shipping  services  to  the  Cook \n76. \nIslands, and (ii) unforeseen and substantial increases in fuel prices and general transport costs. \nA reduction in competition might occur if there were to be a rationalization of shipping services \nonce the larger vessels come into service. The economic analysis has been conservative in not \nallocating all of the ship operating cost benefits to the Project, and the sensitivity analysis shows \nthe Project to be robust against this risk. Substantial increases in fuel prices and transport costs \ncould partially offset the beneficial effects of the Project (and particularly in the tourism sector) \non economic growth through real increases in the prices of imported goods and reduced export \ncompetitiveness.  However,  this  risk  would  have  equal  or  greater  adverse  effect  if  the  Project \nwere not to be implemented. \n \nOverall,  the  identified  risks  do  not  threaten  the  economic  or  financial  viability  of  the \n77. \nProject  and  manageable  risks  can  be  mitigated  through  the  project  design.  Institutional  and \nfinancial  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  separate  ADB  TA  and  the  strengthening  of  CIPA\u2019s \nmanagement  capacity.  Detailed  design  and  provision  for  strict  technical  oversight  will  mitigate \nengineering  design  and  construction  risks.  The  Project  involves  investment  in  basic  lifeline \ninfrastructure that carries no risk of becoming obsolete or redundant and will generate benefits \ndirectly or indirectly for the entire Cook Islands community. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n78. \nAuthority have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  Cook  Islands  Ports \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nfor \n\nInfrastructure  asset  management.

Avatiu  port \nhandles  about  90%  of  total  imports  by  sea,  and  Aitutaki  the  balance.  International  cargo \ndestined  for  the  outer  islands  is  transshipped  at  Avatiu.  International  exports  by  sea  (largely \ncomprised of fish) are minor. The ports at Avatiu and Aitutaki are operated by the Cook Islands \nPorts Authority (CIPA), and the outer island ports are under the jurisdiction of the Office of the \nMinister  of  Island  Administration  (OMIA)  and  the  individual  island  administrations.  OMIA  is  a \ngovernment department granted an annual budget allocation by the Crown to provide essential \nservices to the outer islands, including transportation, energy, and water. \n \n2. \nCIPA is a Crown-owned statutory corporation established by Parliament under the Ports \nAuthority  Act  1995  to  provide  commercially  viable  port  facilities  and  develop  growth \nopportunities  from  the  port  assets,  which  include  Crown  land  and  buildings,  wharves  and \nmarina,  port  facilities,  tugboats,  plant  and  equipment,  storage  sheds,  and  hardstand  areas. \nCIPA  levies  ports  charges  at  both  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  The  new  marina  constructed  at \nAvatiu  Harbor  under  the  Cyclone  Recovery  Reconstruction  Program  also  began  to  provide \nrevenue to CIPA in 2008. The Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC) presently collects the \nrent on land within the port area that is occupied by a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) company \nand  several  food  concessions.  CIIC  has  agreed  that  these  rents  and  any  rentals  from  future \nconcessions  on  port-controlled  land  are  to  be  transferred  to  the  CIPA  accounts.  No  fees  are \nlevied by OMIA to users of outer island ports facilities. \n \nB. \n\nPort Trade \n \n1. \n\nAvatiu Port \n\n \n3. \nThroughputs of dry cargoes and fuel at Avatiu in the past 5 years are shown in Figures \nA2.1  and  A2.2.  Dry  goods  (containers,  vehicles,  break-bulk,  and  bulk  items  such  as  cement, \ntimber, and other building materials) are serviced by two vessels. These are operated by Reef \nShipping  and  the  Pacific  Forum  Line,  alternating  on  an  approximately  21-day  rotation  (i.e.,  a \nship  off-loads  at  Avatiu  about  every  10  days).  All  ships  loading  or  unloading  cargo  at  Avatiu \nmust  be  self-supporting  with  onboard  cranes  or  derricks.  The  port  operates  only  forklifts. \nApproximately 76% of the 68,000 tons imported in FY2007 was in containers. Although the two \nships  are  of  similar  capacity  (86\u201389  meters  [m]  in  length,  6\u20137  m  draft,  about  2,700  gross \nregistered tons, and capacity of about 250 twenty-foot equivalent containers), the Reef Shipping \nvessel carries about 70% of the total dry cargo. \n \n4. \nLiquid bulk cargoes consist of automotive diesel, unleaded gasoline, jet A1 air fuel, and \nLPG.  The  liquid  fuels  are  sourced  from  two  international  fuel  suppliers  (BP  and  ExxonMobil), \nwhile there is a single supplier for LPG imports (Origin Energy). In tonnage, LPG accounts for \n3%\u20135% of total fuel imports. The liquid fuels are offloaded in bulk at the wharf from vessels of \n72\u201390 m chartered by three competing onshore fuel distributors and are pumped into a pipeline \nshared by the distributors under a leasing arrangement. The pipeline connects the wharf to their \nrespective fuel storage facilities. LPG is delivered in tanker containers from vessels of 76\u201386 m \nand transferred to bulk LPG storage adjacent to the cargo storage area at the wharf. There is \ncurrently  no  physical  separation  or  barrier  between  the  LPG  storage  facility  and  the  general \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\ncargo area, but the Government is considering to move the LPG facility to another location for \nsafety  reasons.  Liquid  fuels  are  delivered  to  Rarotonga  about  once  a  month  and  LPG  about \nonce every 2 months. \n\nVessels that use the wharf most frequently are local fishing vessels, averaging 5\u20137 calls \n5. \nper week with stays of a week or more, plus private yachts and tour boats. This small boat traffic \ncauses  some  congestion  in  the  harbor  at  busy  periods,  although  calls  by  local  and  foreign \nfishing  vessels  have  fallen  considerably  since  2004  due  to  poor  fishing  conditions.  There  is  a \nsingle  small  local  interisland  shipping  vessel.  It  carries  transshipped  international  containers, \nfuel, and bulk cargoes to the outer islands on an irregular schedule. \n\nFigure A2.1: Dry Goods Imports Through Avatiu\n\n100,000\n\n90,000\n\n80,000\n\n70,000\n\n60,000\n\n50,000\n\n40,000\n\n30,000\n\n20,000\n\n10,000\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\ns\nn\no\nT\n\ns\nn\no\nT\n\n-\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\n2005\u20132006\n\n2006\u20132007\n\n2007\u20132008\n\nSource: Cook Islands Ports Authority.\n\n \n\nFigure A2.2: Fuel Imports Through Avatiu\n\n-\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\n2005\u20132006\n\n2006\u20132007\n\n2007\u20132008\n\nADO = automotive diesel, LPG = liquefied petroleum gas, MOGAS = motor gasoline.\nSource: Cook Islands Ports Authority.\n\n \n\nBuilding\nMaterial\nCement\n\nTimber\n\nBreak Bulk\n\nVehicles\n\nContainer\nCargo\n\nLPG \n(tons)\nJet A1 \n(tons)\nMogas \n(tons)\nADO \n(tons)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGrowth  in  dry  cargo  and  fuel  imports  was  dampened  by  the  cyclones  of  2005  and  the \n6. \ngeneral  downturn  in  world  economic  conditions  since  2007.  However,  there  has  been  a \nsignificant  upturn  in  cargo  volumes  in  the  current  fiscal  year.  Cargo  volumes  are  strongly \ninfluenced  by  short-  and  long-term  changes  in  the  tourism  sector,  which  also  influence  food \nconsumption,  other  retail  activity,  capital  goods  imports,  fuel  use,  and  construction  of  tourism \nfacilities.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  A2.3,  there  was  strong  growth  in  tourism  from  Europe  and \nAustralia between 1998 and 2000, in addition to growth from New Zealand. Since 2000, almost \nall  growth  in  tourist  arrivals  has  been  from  New  Zealand  (a  significant  proportion  of  which  is \nrepresented  by  Cook  Islanders,  with  a  markedly  lesser  impact  on  tourism  income)  while  other \ntourist  markets  have  been  stagnant  or  declining.  There  is,  however,  strong  potential  for \nresumption  of  growth  in  the  non-New  Zealand  markets\u2014especially  from  North  America  and \nAsia\u2014and hence for strong growth in tourism-related imports. \n \n7. \nTourism also creates direct demand for services at the port, due to increasing arrivals of \nyachts  and  pleasure  boats  and,  especially,  passenger  cruise  ships.  Calls  by  yachts  rose  from \n113 in 2003 to 137 in 2007. Thirty-seven cruise ships visited Rarotonga in 2007 (54% more than \nin 2003), but very few of them have been able to berth within Avatiu Harbor. Most cruise ships \npresently anchor off the reef and bring passengers ashore by tender for day excursions. Once \nthe port project is completed, it is expected that at least 25 cruise ships will be able to berth at \nthe  wharf,  and  cruise  ship  passengers  will  thus  contribute  more  spending  and  income  to  the \nCook Islands economy. \n \n8. \nBased  on  comments  from  international  shippers  and  retailers  in  Rarotonga,  it  is \nanticipated that the current level of import volumes is likely to continue for another 2 years (to \n2010) then establish a long-term growth pattern of approximately 2.5% in real terms per year. \nThis  estimate  coincides  (conservatively)  with  expectations  in  the  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan1 and of New Zealand Agency for International Development2 for 3.5% long-\nterm real annual growth in the Cook Islands economy. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Cook Islands. 2007.

Mataroa  International  used  to  provide  a  monthly \nservice  with  break-bulk  cargo.  Total  revenue  tonnages  shipped  through  Aitutaki  vary  between \n10,000  and  15,000  tons,  or  roughly  10%  of  the  tonnages  through  Avatiu.  There  has  been  an \nincreasing trend toward containers in place of break-bulk cargo. \n \n \n \n10. \nDry  cargo  and  fuel  to  the  other  outer  islands  are  transshipped  from  Avatiu  by  a  single \ninterisland  trader  vessel,  which  operates  infrequently  and  irregularly  with  small  volumes.  No \ncargo tonnage figures are available. \n \nC. \n \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\nOuter Islands Cargo \n\n3. \n\n1. \n\nAvatiu Port \n\n \n11. \nThe  existing  wharf  structure  has  deteriorated  due  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  the \nuse  of  reinforced  concrete  sheet  piles,  many  of  which  are  cracked  and  broken  due  to  hard \ndriving  during  construction,  corrosion  of  steel  anchor  ties,  spalling  of  the  concrete  cope  beam \ndue to corrosion of reinforcement and exacerbated by berthing vessels impacting the quay. \n \n12. \nSecondary  effects  caused  by  these  factors  have  contributed  to  the  loss  of  fill  material \nfrom behind the face of the quay wall and the cracking of pavement slabs on the wharf. Due to \nthe  problems  encountered  with  the  design  of  the  existing  wharf,  and  particularly  the  use  of \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nconcrete  sheet  piles,  this  construction  method  should  not  be  considered  for  the  replacement \nquay wall.

Ships cannot berth at the quay because of the channel depth (maximum less than 2 m at \nhigh tide) and restricted basin space. CIPA has a lighter operation using two old barges, each of \n\n1.00 \n\n1.16 \n\n1.24 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nwhich can transport one full twenty-foot equivalent unit and up to three empty containers. The \nport operates two mobile cranes with 18\u201320 tons capacity each and two forklifts with 3.5-ton and \n6-ton capacity, respectively. Aitutaki Harbor\u2019s main quay has a hardstand area adequate for two \nbarges and a 20-ton mobile crane. \n \n16. \nThe  port  facilities  are  very  basic,  comprising  two  quays  at  right  angles,  an  L-shaped \nstorage area behind the quays, and an additional unpaved storage area south of the quay. The \nquay is in need of repairs and pavements are broken and uneven. The only channel navigation \naid  is  a  transit,  but  there  are  no  channel  marker  buoys.  There  is  limited  storage  in  the  CIPA \ngarage,  where  its  cranes  and  forklifts  are  stored  and  maintained.  Containers  are  either \ntransported to shippers\u2019 premises or unpacked in the open behind a temporary fence. \n \nCIPA  is  carrying  out  needed  repairs  to  the  quay  walls  and  hardstand  area,  and  it  has \n17. \nordered a new 22 m barge capable of carrying two twenty-foot equivalent units and a new 25-\nton forklift. This will provide sufficient cargo handling capacity for the foreseeable future. CIPA \nproposes to develop the harbor in stages, progressively deepening the Arutanga Channel and \nenlarging the basin. \n \n\n3. \n\nOuter Islands \n\n \nThe harbors in the outer islands typically comprise a channel cut through the reef flat to \n18. \na  small  basin  containing  a  dock  area  and  small  boat  ramp.  Some  harbors  have  concrete \nseawalls to provide a measure of protection to the channel and basin. Typically, the dock area \ncomprises  a  concrete  paved  quay  and  a  small  hardstand  area.  Each  island  has  one  or  more \nbarges or large dinghies for transferring cargoes from the ship and which are unloaded onto the \nquay by truck with hydraulic arm owned by the island administration. Pallets are then moved to \na nearby storage shed. \n \nPenhryn has the only harbor (Omoka) in the outer islands that is directly accessible by \n19. \nship. It and the airport were constructed by the US military during the Second World War. Ships \nenter the lagoon through a passage north of Moananui and are able to berth alongside the quay \nand  unload  cargo  directly  onto  the  quay  pavement.  The  dock  area  also  contains  fuel  storage \ntanks for the Cook Islands patrol boat, Te Kukupa. \n \n20. \nThe  smaller  islands  have  very  basic  infrastructure:  Pukapuka  has  a  narrow,  shallow \nchannel cut through the reef into the lagoon. Cargoes are unloaded from the barge at a beach \n(Yato) in front of the storage shed. Nassau has no harbor, and cargoes are ferried by boat to the \nreef edge and trucked across the reef flat at low tide. Palmerston has a shallow channel in the \nreef but no quay and cargoes are unloaded on the beach. \n \n21.  Manihiki, Penhryn, and Pukapuka also have small boat wharfs inside the lagoon at each \nvillage for serving the barges or dinghies transferring cargoes and fuel from the main harbor to \nthe separate villages. \n \nA  needs  assessment  for  the  outer  island  harbors  carried  out  under  the  Cyclone \n22. \nRecovery Reconstruction Plan3 made the following recommendations that have been accepted \nby  the  island  councils.  For  Atiu,  Mangaia,  Manihiki,  Mauke,  Mitiaro,  and  Rakahanga  harbors, \nsome  or  all  of  the  following  works  are  required:  (i)  remove  encroaching  reef  and  improve  the \n\n                                                 \n3  Cook \n\nReconstruction Plan 2006\u20132009.

Design and tendering \nis expected to be completed in FY2009. \n \n24. \nFor  Penhryn  Harbor,  recommendations  include  the  following:  (i)  replace  entire  sheet \npiling  with  concrete  wall  anchored  by  geotextile  mesh,  (ii)  construct  gabion  walls  to  protect \nharbor  walls  north  and  south  of  the  main  quays,  (iii)  repair  or  replace  quay  pavements,  (iv) \nreplace bollards and install new fendering, (v) dredge berth area and shipping channel, and (vi) \nprovide navigation markers in main shipping channel. \n \n25. \nPukapuka  Harbor  requires  construction  of  a  concrete  jetty,  boat  ramp,  and  small \nhardstand  area  at  Yato.  A  second  small  jetty  is  needed  on  Motu  Ko  for  transferring  air \npassengers,  cargo,  and  fuel.  The  boat  passage  across  the  reef  flat  needs  to  be  cleared  and \nimproved and channel markers installed. \n \n26. \nNassau requires construction of a small harbor, including to (i) excavate a channel and \nsmall  basin;  (ii)  construct  concrete quay  or  jetty  on  the  foreshore;  (iii) install  channel  markers, \nbollards,  and  fendering;  and  (iv)  reconstruct  and  widen  the  concrete  causeway  to  the  beach \nridge. The Government plans to undertake this work during FY2009. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nCIPA  is  a  commercial  statutory  authority,  charging  commercial  rates  for  services  and \npaying  taxes  and,  upon  improving  profitability,  dividends  to  the  Government.  Financial \nperformance  for  the  5  years  to  2007  has  been  poor,  however,  due  to  weak  management  and \ndeteriorating asset performance. Operations of the Aitutaki port have never been profitable and \nhave  been  cross-subsidized  by  the  Rarotonga  port  operations.  Top  management  at  CIPA \nchanged in late 2007, and the Project will address the asset performance issues in Rarotonga. \nAs  a  result,  it  may  be  confidently  expected  that  CIPA\u2019s  financial  performance  will  markedly \nimprove in the near and intermediate terms (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n28. \nFinancial  management  at  CIPA  is  good,  although  it  currently  has  no  qualified \naccountant.  Financial  reporting  is  clear  and  based  on  externally  audited  accounts.  Cross-\nsubsidies,  which  include  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  Aitutaki  port  and \naccommodating  interisland  shipping,  the  Cook  Islands  Maritime  Surveillance,  and  local  fishing \noperations,  are  readily  identifiable  and  can  be  isolated  and  potentially  incorporated  into  a \ntransparent  community  service  obligation  subsidy  agreement  (or  payment  in  lieu  of  dividend) \nwith the Government. (The financial separation of Aitutaki port operations from those of Avatiu \nHarbor  will  enable  transparent  quantification  of  the  Aitutaki  port  operations  and  maintenance \ncosts  so  that  they  may  be  addressed  in  the  subsidy  agreement,  lowering  costs  to  the \nGovernment as CIPA\u2019s finance health improves.) \n \n29. \nPort  operations  are  efficient  and  are  carried  out  safely,  with  a  high  level  of  technical \nexpertise  evident.  With  a  total  staff  strength  of  25  and  only  5  in  senior  management  and \n\nInstitutional Capacity and Governance Issues \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ntechnical  positions,  however,  CIPA  is  vulnerable  to  capacity  loss  through  staff  turnover.  CIPA \nlacks  an  asset  management  capability,  as  there  is  only  one  wharf  hand  looking  after \nmaintenance and without the requisite qualifications to implement an asset management plan or \nto program forward-looking preventative maintenance operations on equipment or infrastructure. \nCIPA\u2019s maintenance of equipment and of the wharf structure and buildings has historically not \nbeen adequate. \n \n30. \nThe  needs  for  staff  additions  include  (i)  a  qualified  accountant  to  accommodate \nincreasingly  complex  financial  operations  and  reporting  as  the  port  grows  and  increases  its \ncommercial  focus,  and  (ii)  a  competent  technical  officer  to  exercise  tighter  control  and  better \nplanning of maintenance functions. \n \nCIPA has to date not been able to maximize the income potential of the port land under \n31. \nits control. It lacks incentives to do so, as CIPA has no formal legal instrument over the land with \nthe  right  to  secure  commercial  rents,  apart  from  those  from  the  Ministry  of  Transport  office \nbuilding and cargo storage areas. Transfer of these rights under a lease to CIPA from CIIC over \nthe port and harbor limits will significantly strengthen CIPA\u2019s financial performance and provide \nmanagement with the appropriate commercial incentives to maximize such performance. \n \n32. \nCIPA is currently a self-regulating public corporation.

The import \nof dry goods (containers, vehicles, break-bulk, and bulk items such as cement, timber, and other \nbuilding materials) is serviced by two vessels alternating on an approximately 21-day rotation (i.e., \na  ship  off-loads  at  Avatiu  approximately  every  10  days).  Approximately  76%  of  the  68,000  tons \nimported in FY2007 was in containers. Petroleum imports, all of which pass through Avatiu Harbor, \nconsist  of  three  liquid  fuels  (automotive  diesel,  unleaded  petrol,  and  jet  A1)  and  liquid  petroleum \ngas (LPG). Liquid fuels are delivered to Rarotonga about once a month and LPG about once every \n2 months. \n \nInternational  passenger  cruise  vessels  of  300\u2013650  passenger  capacity  and  up  to  200 \n2. \nmeters (m) call at Avatiu Harbor more than twice a month. Only the smallest of these berth at the \nwharf, and then only rarely. Most cruise ships anchor off the reef and bring passengers ashore by \ntender  for  day  excursions.  Vessels  using  the  wharf  most  frequently  are  local  fishing  vessels, \naveraging  5\u20137  calls  per  week  with  stays  of  a  week  or  more,  plus  private  yachts  and  tour  boats. \nThere is often considerable congestion in the harbor on account of these vessels (though calls by \nlocal  and  foreign  fishing  vessels  have  fallen  considerably  since  2004  due  to  poor  fishing \nconditions). There is a single small local interisland shipping vessel that transships containers, fuel, \nand bulk cargoes to the outer islands on an irregular schedule. \n \n3. \nThe tonnage of dry good imports grew in FY2004 over the previous year by 19%, flattened \nout or declined until FY2007 in the wake of the cyclones of 2005, then resumed strong growth in \nFY2008. A similar pattern characterizes petroleum imports over the period (Appendix 2). \n \n4. \nThe  wharf  upgrade  project  will  provide  (i)  extended  port  life  to  handle  the  country\u2019s  trade \nactivity reliably and safely for a further 30 years; and (ii) increased capacity to maintain efficiency \nand  accommodate  changes  toward  larger  ships  that  are  occurring  in  the  international  shipping \nindustry, as discussed briefly below. \n \nThe  current  wharf  structure  at  Avatiu  was  designed  and  constructed  in  1989.  During \n5. \nconstruction,  difficulties  were  encountered  in  driving  concrete  piles  at  the  wharf  face  and  the \ncompleted structure did not meet design specifications. In the period since, the structural integrity \nof  the  wharf  has  been  steadily  weakened  by  wave  action  and  erosion,  thus  requiring  periodic \nrestoration work, and there is advanced corrosion of the steel works. The wharf has a very limited \nlife, and remedial works are urgently needed. The wharf also has an angle in the middle (about 120 \nm  from  the  harbor  entrance)  that  prevents  long  vessels  from  turning.  The  harbor  itself  also  has \nlimitations, with an uneven depth of about 6\u20137 m below chart datum, a narrow turning basin (about \n120 m, effective), and a narrow harbor entrance (about 100 m). The international tanker and cargo \nvessels that currently use the harbor\u2014typically 86\u201390 m long\u2014are the maximum size that can be \nhandled by the port. \n \nThe port presently fails to meet international standards for the safe operation of container \n6. \nand  fuel  tanker  vessels.  Issues  include,  among  others,  inadequate  slip  clearance  distances \nbetween vessels and permanent structures and ground contours, insufficient working load capacity \nof the mooring bollards due to weaknesses in the wharf structure, an inadequate fendering system, \nand  considerable  debris  and  concrete  rubble  below  the  waterline  and  on  the  harbor  floor  that \ndamage  the  hulls  of  large  vessels.  Without  rehabilitation,  the  port\u2019s  capacity  to  handle  even  the \npresent  volumes  of  fuel  and  cargo  imports  will  require  rapidly  increasing  expenditures  for \nemergency repairs, with increased risks of damage to vessels. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n43 \n\n7. \nFuture  trends  affecting  the  international  shipping  industry  point  to  a  movement  toward \nlarger vessels (up to 120 m length and 6,000 deadweight tons in comparison with current vessels \nof  up  to  90  m  length  and  4,000  deadweight  tons).  There  is  compelling  evidence  that  the \ninternational  shipping  industry  is  subject  to  mergers  and  a  shift  to  larger  vessels.  A  new  vessel \nbeing planned to replace the primary vessel currently delivering cargo to the Cook Islands would \nbe about 114 m in length with a 7 m draft, and it would be capable of carrying bulk fuel in addition \nto containers and break bulk. The new vessel would burn heavy fuel oil, at considerable savings in \ncomparison  with  the  light  distillate  fuel  that  is  used  by  the  current  cargo  vessels.  Shippers  have \ncited lower delivery costs resulting from the capacity to combine fuel and dry goods deliveries. \n \n8. \nThe  port  at  Avatiu  Harbor  handles  about  90%  of  the  cargo  that  comes  into  the  Cook \nIslands.  There  are  no  other  port  facilities  anywhere  in  the  country  that  could  provide  similar \nservices as an alternative to Avatiu. Alternatives to upgrading the Avatiu port would therefore entail \nconstructing  new  port  facilities  at  another  location  in  Rarotonga  (where  70%  of  the  national \npopulation  lives).  Constructing  a  new  port  in  Rarotonga  would  be  very  substantially  more \nexpensive than upgrading the existing port, and it would entail additional considerable social and \nenvironmental costs.  \n \n9. \nWithin  the  Avatiu  Harbor,  alternative  designs  have  been  considered  during  project \npreparation,  including  different  alignments  of  the  wharf  structure,  various  configurations  for  the \nwestern  reaches  of  the  ships\u2019  turning  basin,  and  different  materials  for  the  wharf  structure  (in \nparticular) the wharf face and piling. The proposed port upgrade design has been determined to be \nthe least costly of the available alternatives that meet acceptable technical standards and result in \nextending the port life to 30 years. \n \n10. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  by  comparing  with-project  and \nwithout-project scenarios. The assessment covers 2009\u20132041, on the assumption that construction \nwill extend over a period of 2.5 years starting in the second half of 2009. All benefits and costs are \nin constant 2008 prices. \n \nB. \n \nProject economic costs include site works, quay structure works, bollards, fenders, navaids, \n11. \ndredging  and  blasting  costs,  costs  of  environmental  mitigation,  consulting  services,  and  security \nfencing. There are no land costs and resettlement costs are minor. Taxes and duties are excluded \nfrom the economic assessment. \n \n12. \nThe  local  currency  in  the  Cook  Islands  is  the  New  Zealand  dollar.  There  are  no  levies  or \nduties on imported materials. A value added tax of 12.5% is assessed on all goods and services. \nAs  Cook  Islanders  carry  New  Zealand  passports  and  have  free  rights  to  migrate  and  work  and \nclaim social benefits in New Zealand, there is virtually no unemployment in Rarotonga and wage \nrates  are  an  accurate  measure  of  the  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  Under  these  circumstances,  it  is \nestimated  that  the  shadow  wage  rate  and  exchange  rate  factors  necessary  to  equilibrate  the \nborder  and  domestic  price  levels  of  traded  and  nontraded  goods  in  the  Cook  Islands  are  not \nmaterially different from 1.0. \n \nC. \n \n13.  Without  the  Project,  the  port  facility  at  Avatiu  would  become  unreliable  and  subject  to \nfrequent  disruptions.  The  port  infrastructure  would  continue  to  deteriorate  and  weaken,  requiring \nfrequent and costly fixes. As problems appear, shippers and their insurers will refuse to allow their \nships  to  enter  the  port  without  the  fixes  being  done  to  their  satisfaction.  Short  of  general \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n44 \n \nrefurbishment of the wharf infrastructure similar to that envisaged under the Project, however, the \nfixes will not extend the life of the port and continued fixes through time at increasing cost would be \nnecessary.  As  the  harbor  continues  to  deteriorate  in  the  long  term,  imports  may  have  to  be \ndelivered on small chartered vessels, which would drive up import costs. \n \nInitial repairs to the port that, without the Project, are urgently required to strengthen the tie-\n14. \nback in the wharf face and to shore up bollards, clear underwater debris, etc., are estimated to cost \napproximately  NZ$3  million.  These  repairs,  assumed  to  be  carried  out  one-off  within  the  next  2 \nyears without the Project, would not address the deep structural flaws in the wharf infrastructure, \nsuch  as  the  existing  gaps  in  the  wharf  face  that  allow  seawater  to  intrude  under  the  wharf  deck, \ncreating voids and removing support from the wharf deck above. Without the Project, therefore, the \nvoids  would  continue  to  increase  and  wharf  deck  failures  to  become  more  and  more  common, \nrequiring increasingly frequent emergency fixes. In addition, the real costs of cargo delivery and of \nin-port  services  would  rise  over  time,  as  the  port  infrastructure  deteriorated,  the  delivery  vessels \ncurrently in service were retired but not replaced by commercial shippers due to the poor condition \nof  the  port,  forcing  the  Government  to  charter  small  vessels  with  high  insurance  and  operating \ncosts. \n \n15.  With  the  Project,  cargo  and  fuel  import  volumes  are  assumed  to  increase  at  a  long-term \naverage  annual  rate  of  2.5%  (see  the  sector  analysis  in  Appendix  2  for  further  discussion).  As \ndiscussed  in  Appendix  2,  there  is  a  direct  and  strong  correlation  between  cargo  volume  and  the \nCook Islands\u2019 economic development (i.e., cargo volumes at the port will grow in parallel with the \ngeneral GDP growth rate).1 The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management has affirmed that \nthe country remains on target to meet the Government\u2019s projected sustained real annual economic \ngrowth of 3.5% per year. To be conservative, the analysis has adopted a growth in volumes, and \nhence  port  revenues,  of  2.5%  per  annum.  Without  the  Project,  it  is  assumed  that  the  present \nvolume of dry goods and fuel deliveries would remain constant in the future as such volumes would \nbe  prevented  from  declining  due  to  the  frequent  port  fixes  carried  out  under  the  without-project \nscenario. \n \n16. \nFurther, the harbor is presently too small for current and future vessels, and it is becoming \nincreasingly  difficult  for  commercial  ships  to  maneuver  in  the  harbor  with  safe  clearances  from \npermanent  structures  and  other  vessels.  The  Project  will  improve  safety  while  allowing  a  higher \nlevel of shipping activity with lower per-unit delivery costs than would otherwise be possible.  \n \n17. \nContainerized cargo is currently delivered at Avatiu by 4,000-ton vessels (85\u201390 m length \noverall)  burning  light  distillate  fuel.  New  vessels  likely  to  come  on  line  in  the  next  3\u20135  years, \ncapable  of  carrying  both  cargo  and  fuel  for  delivery,  will  be  of  the  6,000-ton  class  (up  to  120  m \nlength overall), will travel about 50% faster than the vessels that they replace (and thus will burn \nless fuel per ton-mile),  and will burn heavy fuel oil (a substantially cheaper fuel). The Project will \nenable  such  vessels  to  make  deliveries  to  the  Cook  Islands  and  thus  will  help  to  stabilize  and \nreduce  cargo  delivery  costs  even  in  the  face  of  sustained  high  international  fuel  prices. \n(Irrespective of the actual path of fuel prices in the future, the price spread between heavy fuel oil \nand  light  distillate  fuel  is  likely  to  remain  substantial.)  A  comparison  of  vessel  operating  costs \n(slower  4,000-ton  vessel  burning  distillate  fuel  versus  faster  6,000-ton  vessel  burning  heavy  fuel \noil) suggests that the savings in dry goods cargo delivery costs will be on the order of 10%. This is \na highly conservative assumption, as it does not take into account rising costs, under the without-\nproject scenario, of freight arriving on small, chartered vessels at increasing risk and incidence of \ndamage from the unimproved wharf, as well as the attendant rising costs of vessel insurance. Even \n\n                                                 \n1  The elasticity of imports (i.e., the ratio of the percentage change in import volumes to a given percentage change in \n\nreal GDP) is estimated at 1.29 for the period 2002\u20132007. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\nif smaller (85\u201390 m) vessels remain in service to the Cook Islands for the immediate- and medium-\nterm  future,  the  Project  will  ensure  that  commercially  operated  vessels  will  continue  to  deliver \ncargo to the Cook Islands and that vessel chartering and self-insurance by Government\u2014at much \nhigher costs than commercial rates\u2014will be avoided. \n \nFuel delivery costs savings under the Project are also likely, given that the future 6,000-ton \n18. \nships  will  be  capable  of  delivering  fuel  in  combination  with  dry  goods.  A  shipping  company  that \nplans to invest in a 6,000-ton vessel to replace the 4,000-ton vessel currently in service claims that \ndelivery costs for fuel will fall by NZ$0.10 per liter because of this capability. However, potential fuel \ndelivery  cost  savings  may  also  result  from  upstream  fuel  market  rationalization  (e.g.,  regional \nprocurement arrangements or sharing of capacity by competing fuel suppliers) that may or may not \ndepend on port development. In light of this, it is assumed that fuel delivery cost savings of about \nNZ$0.02/liter  will  occur  under  the  with-project  scenario  in  comparison  with  the  without-project \nscenario. \n \n19. \nUnder the with-project scenario, passenger cruise ships will be able to berth at the port in \nmuch  higher  numbers  than  under  the  without-project  scenario.  Presently,  cruise  ships  call  at \nRarotonga approximately 35 times per year (Appendix 2) but very rarely berth at the port. Instead, \ncruise ships anchor off shore and tourist passengers that wish to do so disembark for a day\u2019s visit \nin Rarotonga by ship\u2019s tender. Records indicate that only some 40% of a cruise ship\u2019s passengers \nchoose to come ashore under these circumstances but that well more than 90% disembark if the \ncruise ship is berthed at port. Average expenditure by a cruise ship passenger in Rarotonga during \nsuch  a  visit  for  1  day  is  estimated  at  NZ$100,2 resulting  in  additional  income  in  the  economy  of \nsome NZ$50/passenger/day. Under present circumstances and under the without-project scenario, \nan opportunity for income from tourism is lost by the inability to berth cruise ships in the port. Under \nthe with-project scenario, it is assumed that 25 cruise ships will berth at the port annually and that \nan average of 90% of passengers will disembark for a day\u2019s visit in Rarotonga during such calls. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nAt  a  12%  discount  rate,  the  Project  is  found  to  be  economically  viable.  The  net  present \nvalue (NPV) is NZ$5.5 million and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.9%. The most \nimportant benefits are found to be generated by the Project through dry goods cargo delivery cost \nsavings made possible by the post-project capacity to handle larger cargo ships and the avoided \ncost  of  frequent  emergency  port  repairs.  Relatively  minor  additional  benefits  accrue  from  fuel \ndelivery cost savings and additional tourist expenditure. \n \n21. \nThe  estimates  of  the  benefits  made  possible  by  the  Project  are  considered  to  be \nconservative,  because  the  economic  evaluation  does  not  fully  quantify  the  likely  rises  in  freight \ncharges  (including insurance  charges)  associated  with  reliance  on  small  chartered vessels  under \nthe  without-project  scenario,  nor  does  it  take  into  account  benefits  to  consumers  (i.e.,  additional \nconsumer surplus) provided by a sustained higher level of imports in comparison with the without-\nproject  scenario.  The  actual  benefit  from  the  Project  could  substantially  exceed  the  estimates \npresented. \n \n22. \n \n\nResults of the Economic Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nThe base case EIRR calculation is presented in the table below. \n\n                                                 \n2  Cook Islands Tourism Corporation estimate.

On  the  benefits  side,  the  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  a \ndecrease in dry goods delivery cost savings (SI=2.1). The switching values in the above table show \nthe percentage increase in a cost variable or decline in a benefit variable required for the NPV to \nbecome zero, which is the same as the EIRR\u2019s falling to the cutoff level of 12%. \n \nE. \n \n25. \nA distribution analysis has been carried out for the Project, based on the above results and \nthe  financial  analysis  presented  in  Appendix  9.  At  a  12%  economic  discount  rate  applied  to  the \ncosts  and  benefits  streams  in  both  analyses,  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  economic  net \nbenefits  of  the  Project  to  the  country  as  a  whole  is  NZ$5.46  million,  whereas  the  NPV  of  the \nfinancial  benefits  (FNPV)  of  the  Project  to  the  Cook  Islands  Port  Authority  (CIPA)  is  \u2013NZ$8.28 \nmillion, a difference of NZ$13.74 million. The equalizing discount rate under the economic analysis \nis 15.9%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The equalizing discount rate \nunder  the  financial  analysis  is  6.0%,  exceeding  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital\u2014the  real \ninterest rate facing CIPA\u2014of 1.23%. Thus, the Project is both economically and financially viable. \nIn  particular,  port  charges  as  projected  under  the  analysis  of  CIPA\u2019s  financial  performance \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A)  are  sufficient  to  keep  CIPA  financially  solvent  and  able  to  meet  all \nproject and non-project related costs. The FNPV is negative for the distribution analysis, as the net \nincome  stream  to  CIPA  is  discounted  at  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  The  financial \nanalysis  reflects  all  financial  costs  facing  CIPA,  including  depreciation,  additional  staffing  costs, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n48 \n \ntaxes,  and  loan  financing  costs  that  are  not  reflected  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  economic \nanalysis reflects benefits in the forms of additional earnings to the economy from tourism and lower \ncargo and fuel delivery costs (comparing the with-project scenario to the without-project scenario) \nthat are not reflected in the financial analysis. \n \nAs  shipping  rates  to  the  Cook  Islands  are  regulated  by  the  Government  (the  Ministry  of \n26. \nTransport), it is assumed that savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs (comparing the with-project \nscenario to the without-project scenario) will be passed on to ultimate consumers of goods and fuel \nin the Cook Islands and will not be retained by shippers. \n \n27. \nAs  shown  in  the  distribution  analysis  in  Table  A8.3  below,  the  economic  benefits  of  the \nProject  accrue  to  the  Government  and  economy  in  the  forms  of  taxes  and  additional  tourism \nearnings, and to consumers in the form of cargo and fuel delivery cost savings. Net of the FNPV, \nthe total economic benefits of the Project result in an NPV of the economic net benefits of NZ$5.46 \nmillion. \n \n\nTable A8.3: Distribution Analysis \n(NZ$ million) \n\nDistribution of Project Effects \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \nItem \nBenefits \n  \n  \n\nIncremental Revenue \nAvoided Emergency Repairs \nConsumer Surplus (delivery \ncost savings) \nIncremental Tourism Earnings \n(cruise ships) \nTotal Benefits \n\nFPV \n \n  \n5.15  \n5.55 \n\nEPV \n \n\n  \n5.15 \n5.55 \n\nEPV \nMinus \nFPV \n \n  \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\n \n\n9.98 \n\n9.98 \n\nCIPA \n \n\nGovernment \nand Economy \n \n\nConsumers \n \n\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n9.98 \n\n2.34 \n12.33 \n  \n\n \n10.71 \n  \n15.10 \n2.46 \n1.42 \n18.98 \n(8.28) \n  \n\nCapital Works \nIncremental Operating Costs \nIncremental Taxes \nTotal Costs \n\n  \n  \nCosts \n  \n  \n  \n  \nNet Benefits \nGains and Losses \n\n2.34 \n23.04 \n  \n15.10 \n2.47 \n- \n17.57 \n5.46  \n  \n( ) = negative, CIPA = Cook Islands Ports Authority, EPV = economic present value, FPV = financial present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n\n\u2014 \n0.01 \n(1.42) \n(1.41) \n(13.74) \n\n2.34  \n  \n  \n \n \n\n1.42  \n  \n  \n3.76  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n9.98 \n\n(8.28) \n(8.28) \n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nA  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  Project\u2019s  viability  and  sustainability. \nRevenues  and  expenditures  were  analyzed  to  year  2025  to  assess  income  from  the  port \noperations. The analysis confirms the ability of Cook Islands Port Authority (CIPA) to increase \nincome  through  sustainable  port  operations  that  grow  in  line  with  the  anticipated  increases  in \ngoods  and  traffic  handled  by  the  port.  It  also  confirms  that  CIPA  will  be  able  to  achieve \nacceptable debt coverage over the analysis period. \n \n2. \nThe Project\u2019s costs are estimated at $18.20 million, of which Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  is  financing  $6.88  million  through  an  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  and  $8.64 \nmillion through ordinary capital resources (OCR). The balance ($2.68 million) is financed by the \nGovernment.  The  major  components  of  the  Project  are  realignment  and  reconstruction  of  the \nmain  wharf  at  Avatiu  harbor,  widening  of  the  approach  channel  on  its  western  side,  plus \nexpansion  and  dredging  of  the  inner  basin  to  provide  a  turning  circle  150  meters  in  diameter. \nPeripheral works will include drainage and port lighting plus the upgrading of bollards, fenders, \nand other facilities for the berthing of larger vessels. \n \nThe  accompanying  financial  analysis  measures  the  revenue  generated  from  these \n3. \ncomponents with the future costs of operation and maintenance and debt servicing. A financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) and net present value (NPV) of the financial benefit of the Project \nto  the  CIPA  are  estimated,  with  appropriate  sensitivity  analysis.  The  analysis  is carried  out  by \ncomparing  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  Financial  projections  for  CIPA  are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nCargo  Size  and  Traffic. The Cook Islands is critically dependent on Avatiu Harbor, as \nthe country is highly import-dependent and 90% of the total imports passes through the port. In \nits present state, the port has a very short remaining life. Without the Project, capacity to handle \ncargo volumes would deteriorate, with high risk of import disruptions and correspondingly high \ncosts  for  frequent  emergency  repairs  and  rehabilitation  work.  With  the  Project,  additional \nrevenues will be generated from the steadily increasing volumes of dry goods and containerized \nmaterials coming into the Cook Islands that are necessary to support economic growth. FY2007 \nhas seen significant growth in imports and a corresponding increase in CIPA revenues. There is \na  direct  and  strong  correlation  between  cargo  volume  and  the  Cook  Island\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment (i.e., cargo volumes at the port will grow in parallel with the general rate of GDP \ngrowth. 1  The  Ministry  of  Financial  and  Economic  Management  confirms  that  the  country \nremains  on  target  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  projected  sustained  real  annual  growth  for  the \neconomy of 3.5% per year.2 To be conservative, the analysis has adopted an assumed growth \nin volumes, and hence port revenues, of 2.5% per annum.  \n \nUnder  both  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios,  the  assessment  of  future \n5. \nrevenues  allows  for  the  one-off  introduction  of  new  fees  and  charges  approved  for  the  2009 \nfinancial  year  (applying  from  1  July  2008).  Other  revenues  will  come  from  the  new  western \n\nMajor Revenue Assumptions, With-Project and Without-Project \n\n                                                 \n1  The elasticity of imports (i.e., the ratio of the percentage change in import volumes to a given percentage change in \n\nreal GDP) is estimated at 1.29 for the period 2002\u20132007. \n\n2  Government of Cook Islands. 2007.

A 2.5% increase in business from 2010 onwards is assumed to \n6. \ncontinue in line with expected traffic through the port. Additional income will come from cruise \nships  berthing  alongside  the  wharf  from  2011  onwards,  when  the  port  improvements  and \ndredging  will  be  completed.  The  costs  of  the  Government\u2019s  port-related  community  service \nobligations  (CSOs),  presently  nonrecoverable  by  CIPA,  are  shown  separately.  These  relate  to \nthe  interisland  shipping  and  the  maritime  surveillance  patrol  boat,  for  which  berthage  and \nrelated  port  services  are  provided  without  charge  by  CIPA,  and  the  maritime  surveillance  and \nMinistry of Marine Resources buildings that are sited on port land, but presently do not pay rent \nto  CIPA.  All  revenue  under  the  with-project  scenario  is  expressed  in  2008  dollars  with  the \nfollowing key assumptions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRevenues  for  2008  are  based  on  the  year  to  date  (31  April  2008)  incomes \nannualized for the full year. \nRevenues  for  2009  and  beyond  are  based  on  CIPA\u2019s  new  scale  of  fees  and \ncharges effective from 1 July 2008. \nRevenues  for  2009  show  the  cost  of  the  Government\u2019s  CSOs,  estimated \naccording to CIPA\u2019s fees and charges. \nRevenues  for  2009  and  thereafter  allow  for  increased  rental  fees  to  CIPA  for \nbuildings and development on harbor land. \n(v) \nRental fees for 2009 and thereafter reflect base growth in real terms of 2%. \n(vi)  Marina revenue for 2009 and thereafter reflects base growth in real terms of 2% \n\n(iv) \n\nper annum. \n\n(vii)  Revenue from port core operations for 2010 and thereafter reflects growth in real \n\nterms of 2.5% due to increasing cargo volumes. \n\n(viii)  The formal lease of the port and harbor limits to CIPA will allow the transfer of all \n\nbuilding rents from CIIC to CIPA. \nRevenue for the anchoring of cruise boats at the harbor approaches will continue \nat normal rates until the wharf is improved. The income then adjusts for 25 cruise \nships per annum berthing alongside the wharf plus larger cruise ship vessels that \nwill continue to anchor offshore. \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n7. \nRevenues  without  Project.  Without  the  Project,  cargo  volumes  remain  stagnant \nthroughout  the  analysis  period.  Urgent  repairs  to  the  existing  wharf  and  quay  structure  are \nassumed  to  be  undertaken  between  2009  and  2011,  at  an  estimated  cost  of  NZ$3  million. \nCargo  volumes  are  prevented  from  declining  by  undertaking  increasingly  frequent  emergency \nrepairs and rehabilitation work throughout the analysis period. \n \n8. \nRevenues  included  under  the  with-project  scenario  from  the  recently  commissioned \nwestern marina are retained without the Project but without real growth, as the port and users \nface constant disruptions due to frequent repair work. Also, additional revenues from buildings \nand  activities  transferred  to  CIPA  from  CIIC  are  constrained  due  to  reduced  commercial \nopportunities  in  the  port,  and  additional  revenue  from  cruise  ship  berthing  is  eliminated.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n\n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe \nhow the Project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty \nreduction strategy of the partner country. \n\n \nThe Proposed Project \nThe Project is focused on improving the facilities in Avatiu Harbor, Rarotonga, Cook Islands. The current wharf at this \nlocation is in very poor condition and unsafe. As such, it has a very limited life. It is also designed with an angle that \nprevents berthing of vessels longer than 90 meters. The narrow turning basin in the harbor also restricts vessel length. \n \nThe Project will involve rehabilitation, upgrading, and realignment of the international wharf in Avatiu Harbor (creating a \nsingle wharf face that is about 270 meters [m] long), sheet piling along the entire length of the new wharf face, slight \nwidening  of  the  harbor  entrance,  and  dredging  of  the  existing  harbor  to  8  m  below  chart  datum.  In  the  process,  a \nturning  basin  with  a  150  m  diameter  will  be  created  to  accommodate  vessels  up  to  120  m  long  and  with  full  turning \npotential.  In  this  configuration,  vessels  up  to  about  200  m  in  length  could  reverse  in  with  tug  facilitation,  but  with  no \nturning potential (see site plans at the end of this summary poverty reduction and social strategy). The Project will also \ninvolve improving security of the international wharf, a hazardous material staging area, and rerouting of the petroleum-\nproduct pipeline (currently buried under the wharf), all of which reduce risks to safety at the port. \n \nLinkages to Poverty Reduction \u2013 Cook Islands Context \nAlthough  the  Cook  Islands  is  one  of  the  better  performing  economies  in  the  Pacific,  with  per  capita  gross  national \nincome increasing steadily in  recent  years (by  about 7%\u20138% per annum, from 2000 to 2005, annual  growth in gross \ndomestic product slowed from 8.2% in 2003 to 1.8% in 2006. Some of this is due to increasing costs, especially in the \nlast  2\u20133  years  (oil  price  increases  being  a  major  factor).  Although  the  Cook  Islands  is  not  really  characterized  by \npoverty per se, and especially on Rarotonga, where 80% of the economy of the Cook Islands is generated, data from \n1998 indicated that 12% of the population  was unable to meet the costs of food  and other basic needs and services \nthat are essential for a minimum standard of living. This is referred to as the basic needs poverty line, indicative of the \nproportion  of  households  that  report  having  insufficient  income  (including  subsistence  production)  to  meet  minimum \ndietary  needs  in  addition  to  essential  expenditures  for  goods  and  services  that  are  required  for  a  basic  standard  of \nliving. In fact, Cook Islands does not have a definition for the poverty line, and official statistics now do not report data \nfor families living below the poverty line. Most poor families live in the outer islands, which do not have much in the way \nof  opportunities  for  cash  employment.  They  rely  on  government  pensions  and  welfare,  plus  informal  family  support \nsystems. There are also some pockets of poor families on Rarotonga. \n \nWith increasing costs of imports, poor families are now more vulnerable than they have been in the past. A key factor in \nreducing the cost of imports (a benefit to all Cook Islanders, but especially so for poor families, which spend a much \ngreater percentage of their incomes on basic, essential commodities) is to find some efficiencies of scale (using larger \nships, for example) to counter the continually rising cost of transportation. This is the main link between the proposed \nProject and poverty reduction, discussed below. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  make  an  indirect  contribution  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  Cook  Islands  by  maintaining  and \nupgrading  an  effective  system  of  maritime  imports,  upon  which  the  Cook  Islands  is  almost  totally  dependent,  and \ncreating improved efficiencies to help reduce unit costs of imports. It is consistent with one of the eight priorities in the \nNational  Sustainable  Development  Plan  (strengthened  and  affordable  basic  infrastructure,  transport,  and  utilities  to \nsupport national development). The Project falls  within one of four broad areas that are targeted in the ADB Country \nPartnership  Strategy  for  the  Cook  Islands  (strengthened  and  affordable  basic  infrastructure,  transport,  and  utilities, \nleading to improved economic and social infrastructure and public sector service delivery). Specific project benefits that \ncontribute to poverty reduction or prevention are detailed below. \n \nSpecific Project Benefits that Contribute to Poverty Reduction or Prevention \nApproximately 90% of the food and 100% of the fuel imported into the Cook Islands comes through Avatiu Harbor. The \ncurrent  wharf  configuration  limits  the  size  of  vessels  that  can  berth,  resulting  in  inefficiency  in  cargo  transport  and \nhandling  and  unnecessarily  high  unit  costs  for  imports.  The  upgraded  facilities  will  allow  larger  vessels  to  use  the \nharbor,  reducing  unit  costs.  The  cost-savings  can  be  passed  on  to  all  businesses,  government  agencies,  and \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nconsumers in the Cook Islands (Rarotonga, Aitutaki, and all the outer islands). For example, the value of imports in the \nCook Islands in 2006 was NZ$131 million, or about NZ$6,000 per person living in the Cook Islands. Even an efficiency \nsavings  of  2%  (a  conservative  estimate,  assuming  all  other  input  costs  related  to  shipment  and  handling  of  imports \nremain stable) would amount to $120 per person per year, which is not an insignificant amount.  \n \nThere  is  a  recent  specific  example  of  cargo  consolidation  (maximizing  the  cargo  capacity  of  a  vessel)  resulting  in \nreduced  unit  costs.  Piggybacking  the  import  of  diesel  required  for  Cook  Islands  energy  generators  with  aviation  fuel \nprovided  by  BP  has  lowered  the  unit  cost  of  diesel  and  allowed  electricity  tariffs  to  be  reduced  by  up  to  6%  (for \ncommercial users). Similar cost savings could be achieved for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), as well, if larger ships were \nable to enter the harbor. There is even a risk that the company that charters the current LPG carrier will be required to \nscale up the size of its vessel to meet growing LPG demand in the Pacific, which would then preclude LPG shipments \nto the Cook Islands altogether (if a larger LPG carrier cannot enter Avatiu Harbor). \n \nThe Project indirectly supports the maintenance of a vibrant tourism sector, which is the main contributor to the Cook \nIslands  economy.  With  up  to  100,000  visitors  per  year,  tourism  increases  the  food  requirement  in  the  Cook  Islands \n(above that required by the local population) by about 10%\u201320% at any one time. Much of that must come through the \nport. Increasing food costs, due to inefficient transportation and handling, reflected in the retail prices of meals in hotels \nand  restaurants,  then,  comprise  one  more  factor  reducing  the  tourism  competitiveness  of  the  Cook  Islands  at  a  time \nwhen global tourism is likely to recede in any case. \n \nThe  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  wharf  at  Avatiu  Harbor  will  preclude  a  catastrophic  failure  of  the  existing  wharf \n(possible in a cyclone or in a ship collision). Thus, a critical lifeline to the Cook Islands (provision of survival essentials \nand commercial opportunities) can be secured. \n \nThe improved facilities in Avatiu Harbor will accommodate passenger cruise ships (especially the smaller Tahiti-based \nships, which typically have a length of about 157 meters or less). At the moment, very few cruise ships can enter Avatiu \nHarbor  (the  Clipper  Odyssey,  at  110  meters  length,  reversed  into  the  harbor  in  early  April  2008).  Some  larger \npassenger  cruise  ships  try  to  access  Rarotonga  by  passenger  lighters,  depending  on  the  sea\u2019s  state,  but  at  the \nmoment much local retail business opportunity is lost. For example, there was a pent-up demand from 23 cruise ships \nin FY2007 wanting to enter the harbor. Accommodating the smaller passenger cruise ships (Tahiti-based, and perhaps \nothers) in Avatiu Harbor will provide significant positive economic spinoffs to local businesses throughout Rarotonga. \n \nAlignment of the two sections of the international wharf will allow larger vessels to move further into the harbor, beyond \nthe airport flight path (which has a structure height restriction of 24 meters). At the moment, tall vessels must leave the \nharbor altogether when flights arrive and depart or at least drop their loading booms at these times. With the new wharf \nalignment, this will no longer be necessary (saving time and fuel costs). \n \nThe construction of the wharf and harbor dredging will provide significant local business and labor opportunities, which \nwill themselves create immediate benefits to the Rarotonga economy.  \n \nThe entire Project will be undertaken on port land and within the existing Avatiu Harbor \u201cfootprint,\u201d with the exception of \none small business (a fish restaurant) in premises leased from Cook Islands Investment Corporation on port land which \nwill be moved to an alternate site within the port. There is no requirement for a new land lease by the Ports Authority. \nThe requirement to move or destroy buildings is limited to one Ports Authority shed that is part of the port development \nplus the restaurant business. No houses or roads are affected. This means there are no significant obstacles related to \nland tenure and social issues. That reduces the cost of the Project and increases the efficiency of its implementation, \nrepresenting a net benefit to the Cook Islands economy. As such, the Project will have no direct negative social impact \nor contribute to poverty inasmuch as it will not marginalize any segment of Cook Islands society. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n\n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n\n     General  Intervention; \n\n Individual  or  Household  (TI-H); \n\n Geographic  (TI-G); \n\n Non-Income  MDGs  (TI-M1, \n\n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: \n\nThe  proposed  Project  does  not  target  a  specific  segment  of  the  Cook  Islands  population.  It  is  intended  to  benefit  all \nCook Islanders who depend of maritime imports for subsistence and for business.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n\n1. \n\nIf the Project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n\nNo full poverty analysis is required, as this is a GI project. \n\nM2, etc.) \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n57 \n\n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n\nThe PPTA economist will determine the net economic benefits (in dollar terms) of the proposed Project. That will give a \nmore  accurate  picture  of  the  potential  for  poverty  reduction  when  the  defined  benefits  are  spread  through  the  Cook \nIslands population. \n\n2. \n\nIf GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n\nThis is a very specific infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading project having no direct link to poor segments of \nCook Islands society or to government policy affecting such groups. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity during the \nconstruction phase of the Project to provide jobs for unemployed youth and other disadvantaged groups (unskilled \nlabor) \n\n \n\nA. \n\nInitial Social Analysis \n\nfrom the Project? \n\nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n\nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who  are  the  potential  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project?  How  do  the  poor  and  the  socially  excluded  benefit \n\nThe initial beneficiaries of lower costs from the Project in comparison with the without-project scenario are private and \npublic  sector  consumers  in  the  Cook  Islands,  as  they  will  avoid  the  impact  of  steeply  rising  delivery  costs  that  are \nexpected if the harbor is allowed to continue deteriorating. The proposed Project will result in avoidance of increased \ncosts of food, fuel, and goods to consumers that will arise on account of increased freight charges that would occur in \nthe  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario.  Therefore,  savings  in  cargo  and  fuel  delivery  costs  (comparing  the  with-project  and \nwithout-project  scenarios)  will  be  retained  by  ultimate  consumers  of  goods  and  fuel  in  the  Cook  Islands  and  not  by \nshippers. The poor and socially excluded will benefit from these cost savings like all other consumers, but their benefit, \nas a percentage of household income, will be higher compared to that of most Cook Islanders. Secondary benefits of \nthe Project, including economic spinoffs from new users of the port (such as cruise ships) that lead to increases in retail \ntrade should also percolate through the local population in Rarotonga.  \n \nWhat are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed Project? \nConsumers in the Cook Islands need to know that the Government is making all efforts to stabilize or even reduce the \ncost  of  imports  upon  which  the  Cook  Islands  are  so  dependent.  As  part  of  the  economic  analysis  of  the  Project, \nefficiencies of scale related to shipping  with larger vessels need to be clearly defined and the potential distribution of \nsuch benefits mapped in terms of different segments of the Cook Islands population.  \n\n \n2.  What  are  the  potential  constraints  in  accessing  the  proposed  benefits  and  services,  and  how  will  the  Project \n\naddress them? \n\nThe  main  potential  constraint  upon  Cook  Islanders\u2019  accessing  the  proposed  benefits  of  the  Project  is  that  the  cost \nsavings in transportation and handling of cargo at Avatiu Harbor will be absorbed in increased port fees or taken up in \nthe profit margins of the shipping companies. The Government will need to monitor the Ports Authority\u2019s wharfage fees, \nas  well  as  the  local  wholesale  and  retail  prices  of  fuel,  food,  building  materials,  etc.,  in  order  to  gauge  the  extent  to \nwhich  cost  savings  due  to  more  efficient  transportation  and  handling  of  cargo  at  Avatiu  Harbor  are  passed  on  to \nconsumers and not retained by the shipping companies and agents. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. \n\nIndicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n\nInitial  stakeholders  include  the  Ports  Authority,  local  shipping  companies  and  agents,  the  petroleum  products \ncompanies,  local  wholesale  and  retail  businesses,  and  all  consumers  in  the  Cook  Islands,  as  well  as  the  local  civil \nengineering companies that may be involved in design and construction of the Project. Secondary stakeholders include \nthe Government agencies that have some regulatory jurisdiction over the Project or a technical interest (including the \nMinistry  of  Works,  National  Environment  Service,  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources).  Tertiary  stakeholders  include \nenvironmental  nongovernment  organizations,  local  business  associations,  and  local  landowners  (representing \ncommunity interest in the Project and acting as conduits of information as the Project develops). \n \n\n2.    What  type  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  required  during  the  PPTA  or  project  processing  (e.g., \ninvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \n\nworkshops,  community  mobilization, \norganizations, etc.)? \n\nConsultations  have  already  been  held  with  all  identified  stakeholders  to  determine  their  interests  and  concerns \nrelated  to  the  Project.  A  land  use  policy  workshop  was  used  as  a  venue  to  describe  the  Project  and  solicit  ideas, \nconcerns,  and  issues  from  representatives  of  all  stakeholders.  As  a  result  of  the  one-on-one  consultations  and  the \ngroup  meeting,  no  specific  social  or  poverty-related  issues  have  been  raised.  Environmental  issues  (which  can  be \naddressed  in  project  design  and  by  mitigation  during  construction)  will  be  documented  in  the  project  initial \nenvironmental examination. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n\n  \n\n   Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making       \n\n Empowerment \n\nOngoing information sharing and stakeholder consultation will continue, especially as the engineering design develops \nand the economic aspects of the Project are analyzed. \n \n\n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared? \n\n  Yes       \n\n   No    Please explain.  \n\nThe  current  style  and  format  of  consultation  and  participation  (one-on-one  meetings  and  occasional  group  sessions) \nshould continue as the Project is designed. To date, this has ensured that all stakeholders are informed and given a \nchance  to  be  involved,  and  there  is  already  a  sense  of  inclusiveness  in  the  Project.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the \nProject has adversaries (although there is always discussion of alternative port options, which are outside the scope of \nthe Ports Authority mandate and the focus of the proposed loan). \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n\nThere  are  no  gender  issues  or  specific  opportunities  for  gender  equality  with  this  proposed  Project,  given  its  very \nlimited focus on construction and dredging. Nevertheless, the benefits of the Project (potentially stabilized or reduced \ncosts  of  imports)  will  be  pervasive  and  affect  all  segments  of  the  Cook  Islands  population:  women,  men,  youth,  and \ndisadvantaged groups). \n\n \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment  by  improving  women\u2019s  access  to  and  use  of  opportunities,  services,  resources,  assets,  and \nparticipation in decision making?     \n\n   No    Please explain. \n\n  Yes       \n\nThe Project has a very sharp focus on shipping and cargo handling (improving efficiency, and ensuring the integrity of \nport  services  well  into  the  future).  It  does  not  lend  itself  to  policy  change,  governance  per  se,  or  selective  access  to \nservices and benefits. \n\n \n3.  Could the proposed Project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?         \n       \n\n   No    Please explain. \n\n  Yes       \n\nThe main benefits of the Project will accrue to the business community and all Cook Islands consumers. There is no \ngender bias evident in these benefits, and no adverse impact on women and girls is expected. \n\n \n\n \n\nIssue \n\n \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement  \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nNature of Social Issue \n\nSingle small business in leased \nbuilding to be relocated to a \nsimilar position nearby. \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact/Not Known \nLimited impact. \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples  \n \n \n \n\n \nLabor \n\n  Employment \n\nOpportunities \n\n Labor Retrenchment  \n Core Labor Standards \n\n \n\n \n\nThere are no indigenous people \nwithin the zone of influence of \nthe Project. \n\nNo impact. \n\nSlight positive impact on \nlocal labor opportunities. \n \nLittle or no risk of breach \nof Core Labor Standards, \ndue to employment and \nsociety norms in the Cook \nIslands. \n \n\nThere will be some opportunities \nfor local employment (dredging \nand construction), and possibly \nsome economic spinoffs in \nmaterial supply to the selected \ncontractor.

If \nthis benefit occurs, there are no \naffordability issues for Cook \nIslanders. \nAll port projects, whether new or \ninvolving rehabilitation or \nupgrading, raise the local risk of \nHIV/AIDS associated with \nincreased port visitation by \nseafarers. Current official \nHIV/AIDS statistics for the Cook \nIslands indicate only two \ndocumented cases (neither \nrelated to shipping, ports). So, \nalthough the risk of HIV/AIDS in \nthe Cook Islands may rise if \nthere is a future increase in \nshipping and greater numbers of \nseafarers in Rarotonga, the \ncurrent risk appears to be well-\nmanaged.   \n\n \n\n1.

All affected land and structures are fully owned by the \nCook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  (CIIC)  of  the  Cook  Islands  Government,  and  these  are \nshortly  to  be  transferred  to  the  Cook  Islands  Ports  Authority.  Apart  from  two  businesses,  all \nbuildings  that  will  be  internally  relocated  by  the  Government  are  leased  by  governmental \ndepartments.  The  remaining  two  businesses  and  their  leased  premises  are  the  subject  of  this \nresettlement plan.
