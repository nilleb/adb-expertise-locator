THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Cook Islands for the Improving Internet Connectivity for the South Pacific Project. \n \n2.  The Government of the Cook Islands has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support the Cook Islands\u2019 share in the Manatua cable system (MCS), a regional submarine \ninternet cable system that will link Samoa and French Polynesia (non-ADB member), with \nadditional spurs and branching units to link Rarotonga and Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, and Niue \n(non-ADB member). ADB financing will cover (i) the design and construction of the spurs and \nbranching units for Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and (ii) the Cook Islands\u2019 share in the design and \nconstruction of the MCS. The Government of New Zealand, represented by the Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade, will provide grant cofinancing to the government for the project. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economy. The Cook Islands\u2019 economy is small and open, and has a narrow base, \nmaking it vulnerable to all kinds of shocks, including disasters triggered by natural hazards. The \nsize and dispersion of the islands over a remote and wide area of ocean reduce opportunities to \nachieve economies of scale.1  Though the population has one of the highest per capita incomes \nin the Pacific ($15,055 in FY2016),2 the free movement of people to New Zealand has led to a \ndeclining and aging population. \n \n4.  Despite these difficulties, the government has maintained macroeconomic stability. Prices \nhave been relatively stable, goods and services trade has large and persistent surpluses, and the \nfinancial system is sound. The government has made significant investments in infrastructure. \nEven so, long-term average growth hovers at about 1% (footnote 2). This manifests itself in limited \njob creation and slow growth in government revenue, which can inhibit the provision of essential \nservices and the desired level of social support. \n \n5.  Tourism accounts for more than 60% of gross domestic product (GDP). But its growth \npotential is constrained by shortages in accommodation facilities; issues with the current land \nleasing framework; inadequate water supply, sanitation, and electricity infrastructure; and high \ntelecommunications costs. The tourism and public sectors are the biggest internet users. \n \n6.  Connectivity and growth. Improved access to more affordable telecommunications, \nespecially  high-speed  broadband  internet,  may  mitigate  isolation  and  other  constraints  to \neconomic development in the Cook Islands. Based on a World Bank report, every 10-percentage-\npoint  increase  in  broadband  penetration  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries  accelerates \neconomic growth by 1.38 percentage points.3 High-speed internet reduces transaction costs for \n                                                \n1  The Cook Islands has Tonga to its west, Kiribati to its north, and French Polynesia to its east. It is surrounded by \nnearly 2 million square kilometers of ocean and has 15 islands with a total land area of 240 square kilometers. There \nare two main island groups: the north consists of seven atolls and the south consists of eight volcanic islands. The \nCook Islands has a population of 19,000, most of whom live on the largest island, Rarotonga. Many of the smaller \nislands are sparsely populated. \n2  ADB. 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017: Transcending the Middle-Income Challenge. Manila. \n3  World Bank. 2009. Information and Communications for Development 2009: Extending Reach and Increasing Impact. \nWashington, DC. ", "2 \nbusinesses, governments, and households; opens new business opportunities; and improves \npublic service delivery by harnessing information and communication technology.4 \n \n7.  A submarine cable would provide higher capacity and quality broadband internet at much \nlower cost to the Cook Islands than is currently the case, making the internet more accessible \nand affordable to the broader population. This would help Cook Islanders communicate with their \nrelatives  residing  abroad.  Regional  integration  would  also  be  supported  by  increasing  the \nfrequency and quality of communications among countries in the Pacific region, thus increasing \ntrade in services (tourism and back-office functions) and allowing the region to form a sizable \nmarket for digital products and services. It would also strengthen existing regional public goods \nand encourage the development of new forms of regional cooperation by allowing countries to \nbetter share available knowledge and human resources in the Pacific. \n \n8.  Industry structure and governance. Telecom Cook Islands (TCI), trading as Bluesky \nCook Islands (40% government owned and 60% owned by Bluesky Pacific Group),5 is the only \ntelecommunications provider in the Cook Islands. TCI provides 100% geographic coverage for \ntelecommunication in the country and 83% of Cook Islanders with access to mobile data services. \nTCI began using Other Three Billion (O3B) provided service in 2014 to reduce communication \ncosts. Uptake was rapid and capacity is already constrained. Moreover, the service is prone to \nweather  disruption.  The  retail  price,  while  lower  than  that  for  traditional  satellite-based \nconnectivity, is still significantly higher than that for services provided via fiber-optic cables.6 The \nhigh cost of international bandwidth is the principal constraint to higher internet penetration, the \nintroduction of new telecommunications services, and new retail market entrants. \n \n9.  The government is finalizing appropriate legislation to regulate telecommunications in \nparallel with development of the cable, so that necessary regulations and institutional structures \nare in place before the cable service becomes operational. The legislation will (i) liberalize the \ntelecommunications market, allowing the entry of interested operators through licensing; and (ii) \nset up an independent regulatory body to manage licensing, tariff setting, service level, resource \nsharing, and customer complaints. The legislation has gone through wide consultation and is \nexpected to be passed by Parliament in November 2017. \n \n10.  Regional approach to internet connectivity. The Cook Islands has recognized the need \nto improve internet connectivity. A 2012 assessment financed by ADB found the cost of building \na cable connection to Samoa (the closest internet submarine cable connection point) was too \ncostly to be financially viable for the Cook Islands alone.7 Shared cable construction of a \nsubmarine cable would have reduced the cost borne by the Cook Islands, but this option did not \neventuate given different countries\u2019 (Samoa, French Polynesia) priorities. \n \n11.  Following critical facilitation and support from New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs \nand Trade, in April 2017, the government signed an agreement with the governments of French \nPolynesia, Niue, and Samoa to facilitate the design, construction, and operation and maintenance \nof the MCS. These governments will share the cost of the cable system, estimated at $60 million, \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2017.

This supports e-government feasibility in the Cook Islands. \n5  Amalgamated Telecom Holdings, Fiji\u2019s main telecommunications holding company, is in the process of acquiring \nBluesky Pacific Group, a telecommunications provider in the Pacific. \n6  Prepaid Wi-Fi services are available at different data volume levels. A 1,250-megabyte prepaid package costs NZ$50 \nand a monthly package for 100 gigabytes of data costs NZ$699 per month. No unlimited data plan is available. \n7  ADB. 2013. Report on the Feasibility of an International Submarine Cable System for the Cook Islands. Consultant\u2019s \nreport. Manila (TA 7787-REG). \n ", "3 \n \nwith ADB and the Government of New Zealand cofinancing for the Cook Islands, the Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement and European Investment Bank cofinancing for French Polynesia, \nand the Government of New Zealand financing for Niue. Resources of the Samoa Submarine \nCable Company (SSCC) will finance Samoa\u2019s costs. The Cook Islands\u2019 share of the cost is $20 \nmillion. Avaroa Cables, a newly established limited liability company to own and operate the Cook \nIslands cable system,8 has joined the Project Steering Group (PSG)9 consortium to implement \nand operate the MCS. Consortium members will enter into a construction and maintenance \nagreement (CMA)10 for the MCS, which will include the financing commitments of the consortium \nmembers.11 \n \n12.  The PSG\u2019s technical advisor recommended a submarine cable solution connecting Tahiti \nin French Polynesia to Samoa. The Cook Islands and Niue will connect to it through their own \nspurs and branching units. The cable system will provide an additional internet redundancy option \nfor Samoa and French Polynesia. Samoa is currently connected to the system via the American \nSamoa Hawaii Cable to American Samoa and onward to Hawaii, and the Tui-Samoa Cable to Fiji \nthat is under construction. French Polynesia is currently connected via the Honotua cable owned \nby the Office des Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication (OPT). The MCS solution offers the Cook Islands \nan opportunity to share the cable system\u2019s implementation and operating cost. The Cook Islands \nwill have access to the technical and operational expertise of OPT and SSCC to run a cable \nsystem.  \n \n13.  The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for the \nCook Islands.12 It is also consistent with the Cook Islands\u2019 National Sustainable Development \nPlan, 2016\u20132020, which identified improving broadband connectivity and making broadband \ninternet affordable as key activities under goal 5 (build resilient infrastructure and information and \ncommunication technology to improve the standard of living).13 \n \n14.  The proposed project is the fourth ADB funded submarine cable system in the Pacific. \nLesson  from  the  previous  projects  have  been  considered  in  designing  the  technical \nconfigurations, institutional arrangements, and developing the operational plan for the cable \nsystem. Telecommunications reform undertaken will facilitate the project outcome. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: telecommunications in the Cook Islands \nimproved (footnote 13). The project will have the following outcome: internet service cost reduced \nand quality improved.14 \n \n                                                \n8  Avaroa Cables\u2019 ownership comprises equal shareholding by the Government of the Cook Islands and the Cook \nIslands Investment Corporation. This ownership arrangement allows for up to 20% of the company to be held by the \nprivate sector. The government is seeking to attract private shareholders. \n9  Other consortium members are the Office des Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication (OPT) in French Polynesia, SSCC in \nSamoa, and Telecom Niue in Niue. ADB has completed integrity due diligence on the consortium members and \nidentified no significant integrity risk.  \n10 The CMA details the organizational structure, cost-sharing mechanism, roles, and responsibilities of the consortium \nmembers for the MCS. The CMA is critical for the cable system and will be signed before consortium members enter \ninto a works contract with the contractor. \n11 The Cook Islands will have 40% capacity share. \n12 ADB. 2016.

The project output will be the construction and commissioning of the Cook Islands\u2019 portion \nof the MCS connecting Samoa and French Polynesia, which includes additional spurs and \nbranching units to connect Aitutaki and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands.15 It will be achieved \nthrough the (i) construction of the MCS (partially financed under the project) and (ii) landing \nstations in Rarotonga and Aitutaki, efficient and effective operation of Avaroa Cables by the \ngovernment, and timely negotiation and signing of the CMA among PSG consortium members. \nThe project will be supported by a project management unit (PMU) initially resourced by a team \nof project implementation consultants. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $27.47 million (Table 1). \n \n18.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).16 The Project will fund a dedicated PMU to support Avaroa \nCables  during  project  implementation.  Financing  charges  during  implementation  will  be \ncapitalized and are included in the project cost estimates. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a regular loan of $15 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The government will contribute $2 million equivalent in the \nform of tax and duty exemptions and will meet the cost of operating Avaroa Cables during project \nimplementation that cannot be met by revenues. The Government of New Zealand will provide \ncollaborative joint financing with a NZ$15 million grant for the project. \n \n                                                \n15 The spurs and branching units for Rarotonga and Aitutaki are integral parts of the MCS. Therefore, the entire MCS \nis referred to under the project output. \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n \n20.  The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements.17 Based on the government\u2019s choice of repayment terms \nand the straight-line repayment method, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.1% per year. The interest and the commitment charges for the loan \nduring project implementation will be capitalized. \n \n21.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nManatua Cable supply and installation, construction of the landing stations, and cost of setting up \nthe Project Management Unit (PMU). \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  15.00  54.6 \nNew Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (grant)  10.00a  36.4 \nGovernmentb  2.47  9.0 \nTotal  27.47  100.0 \na  Estimated NZ$15 million equivalent in United States dollars. \nb  The Government of the Cook Islands will contribute in the form of tax and duty exemptions and the cost of operating \nAvaroa Cables during project construction and until revenues can sustain this cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management will be the executing agency and will \nfacilitate the smooth flow of funds and overall project management. The government has set up \nAvaroa Cables to be the project\u2019s implementing agency and will relend the loan proceeds to \nAvaroa Cables under the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan.18 Avaroa Cables will enter \ninto a project agreement with ADB. \n \n23.

Pursuant to the CMA, the PSG will implement the MCS, including procurement and \ncontract administration. Avaroa Cables will be responsible for building the landing station facilities \nin Rarotonga and Aitutaki. Avaroa Cables will set up a PMU to coordinate with other PSG \nconsortium members, vendors, and financiers. The PMU will also help the government and \nAvaroa Cables meet all technical and safeguard-related project covenants. ADB will sign a \nmemorandum of understanding with other financiers to reflect the cofinancing amount. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Avaroa Cables joined the PSG to connect Rarotonga and Aitutaki in the Cook Islands to \nthe internet network through the MCS. The regional approach will help Avaroa Cables share \nsignificant capital and operational costs with other PSG consortium members. Moreover, Avaroa \nCables  will  have  the  opportunity  to  get  support  from  experienced  consortium  members  in \nmanaging cable operations. The configuration will also provide the flexibility for the Cook Islands \nto connect via Samoa or French Polynesia. \n \n26.  Given its well-established and proven technology, a submarine cable is the preferred, \nmost  cost-effective,  and  most  sustainable  method  for  internet  connectivity.  The  indicative \nlocations for cable landing stations are identified and will be finalized after the marine survey \noperation during implementation. In both Rarotonga and Aitutaki, the landing station will be \nconnected to the existing copper and fiber-optic ring system. Local telecommunications providers \nwill be responsible for bringing internet services to the public, offices, and institutions using their \nown infrastructure. The technical design considers the possible impacts due to climate change \nand adopts measure to mitigate it, including through the location of land -based facilities. \n \n27.  Avaroa Cables will act as the wholesale internet bandwidth provider and will sell to local \ntelecommunications operators in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner, following the Cook \nIslands  telecommunications  regulatory  policy  (under  development).  The  independent \ntelecommunications regulatory body will be responsible for maintaining internet price and quality. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Financial. In assessing the project\u2019s financial viability, ADB conservatively forecasted \ndemand below the region\u2019s average adoption rates, at about 45% average growth during the first \n5 years after the cable comes into service, and then a steady decline to 2% over the next 15 \nyears, which is sustained thereafter for five years. The average annual growth rate over 25-years  \nis estimated at 24%. Avaroa Cables will generate revenues from the wholesaling of broadband \ninternet capacity. ADB evaluated the project\u2019s financial viability by estimating the cash flows from \n ", "7 \n \noperations and calculating the financial internal rate of return. The project cost was estimated \nbased on mid-2017 United States dollar prices. Financing charges were excluded for the financial \nevaluation. \n \n29.  The financial internal rate of return was estimated at 11.20% against the weighted average \ncost of capital of 6.62%. Cash flows are most sensitive to revenue shocks. To support its financial \nviability, Avaroa Cables must encourage demand growth through fair and open access and \nattractive, transparent pricing for all retail service providers. Financial viability is also sensitive to \na  substantial  capital  cost  overrun,  but  this  risk  is  considered  low  as  cost  estimates  are \nbenchmarked on similar cable development projects in the Pacific. \n \n30.  Economic. The analysis used constant 2017 prices and a world price numeraire. ADB \nadjusted benefits, onshore operating costs, and 60% of costs incurred by domestic retail service \nproviders to economic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.87 and a shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.95. No conversion factors were applied to tradable capital costs. Price reductions at \u2013\n60% and a service quality premium at +20% were considered for existing medium earth orbit \nsatellite system internet users. For new customers, willingness to pay corresponds to the entire \narea under their demand curve. \n \n31.  Benefits are proportional to internet users\u2019 willingness to pay, which is calculated as the \nsum of two components: (i) the annual consumer surplus, estimated at about 0.8% of GDP and \ndetermined through (a) World Bank estimates of comparable demand curves for mobile telephony \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and the Philippines; and (b) estimated consumer surplus \nratios in those countries; and (ii) the annual revenue per user (ARPU) for retail internet services, \nwhich is the product of the mature market ARPU and the projected number of subscribers. The \nmature market ARPU was estimated at 7% of GDP per capita ($84 per subscriber per month in \n2016) based on a composite normalized demand curve for the same three countries, which \nflattens out at 7% beyond a 15% penetration rate. Benefits are considered to grow in line with real \nGDP growth (assumed at 2.1% per year) and capped at 3.5% of GDP. \n \n32.  The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return under the base case scenario is estimated \nat 13.6%, above the minimum required economic internal rate of return for ADB investment \nprojects of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis confirms that economic viability is maintained even with a \n20% reduction in projected benefits, a 10% increase in capital expenditure, or a 10% increase in \noperating expenditures. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n33.  Financial management. The government\u2019s public financial management performance \nhas  improved  in  terms  of  budget  credibility,  mainly  because  of  better  budget  execution, \nmonitoring, and reporting.19 Its national accounting standards are generally consistent with \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards. The auditing practice is based on international \nstandards, but limited resources constrain timely reporting. The financial management risk is high \nmainly because Avaroa Cables is newly established. During implementation, the PMU will support \nAvaroa Cables with an experienced finance and accounting specialist to manage its financial \naccounting and reporting within the first 6 months of the project effectiveness date. ADB has \nproposed a comprehensive time-bound action plan in the PAM to mitigate the risk. \n \n                                                \n19  PEFA.

The government has made significant improvements in public \nprocurement since 2012 in terms of legislation, regulation, and documentation.20 Still, lack of \nintegration of functions and limited resources and expertise remain a challenge. The PSG has \nrecruited a consulting firm, funded by its members, to prepare the bidding documents and conduct \nthe bidding process for the MCS. The PSG will work with ADB to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended time to time). As agreed between PSG consortium \nmembers and ADB, ADB will review the bid evaluation report and provide a \u2018no objection\u2019 before \nPSG consortium members sign a contract with the contractor. For the landing station construction \nand  PMU  recruitment,  Avaroa  Cables  will  work  closely  with  ADB  and  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). Universal procurement will apply as the ADB loan and New Zealand grant will jointly \nfinance the procurement and the consulting services packages.21 \n \n35.  Avaroa Cables has two directors and a secretary in place who will engage staff, including \na chief executive officer, a technical engineer, and an accountant, to run the company\u2019s business \nbefore the cable becomes operational. The PMU will provide training to the new recruits on the \nbusiness process and accounting standards. There will be sufficient overlap between Avaroa \nCables staff and PMU consultants to maintain uninterrupted business operation. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  The project is expected to lower internet costs and make them more affordable to wider \nsegments of the population. It is expected to promote a conducive environment for businesses \nand private investment, which would create employment and income opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.22 \n \n39.  Environment (category B). ADB has prepared an initial environmental examination, \nincluding an environmental and social management plan (ESMP). The project will affect a corridor \nthat is 3\u20134 meters wide, including the footprint of the submarine trenching machine on the seafloor \nin the inner reef zone, and to a depth of 0.75\u20131.00 meters beneath the sediment. The one-off \ndisturbance associated with cable placement is restricted mainly to a strip of seabed less than 2 \nmeters wide. The cable, 4\u20137 centimeters in diameter in the nearshore zone, will be buried as it \npasses the natural channel through the barrier reef into the Rarotonga and Aitutaki nearshore \nzone. The key environmental interactions are in the nearshore areas where the cable requires \nburial  to  avoid  potential  entanglement  with  fishing  activities  and  other  human  activities. \nDisturbances and impacts caused by cable laying and maintenance should be viewed in the \ncontext of the frequency and extent of these activities. The cable route will avoid sensitive habitats \nsuch  as  corals  and  designated  areas.  Experienced  divers  will  place  the  cables  following \ninstructions from the Ministry of Marine Resources. These measures will limit any chance that the \n                                                \n20  ADB. 2017.Country and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk Assessment \u2013 Final report.

Unless a cable fault develops, the seabed will \nnot be disturbed again within the system\u2019s design life of about 25 years. \n \n40.  Avaroa Cables will update the ESMP based on detailed information from the surveys to \nbe conducted during the project\u2019s pre-construction stage. Any existing information gaps in the \nbaseline will be filled at this stage. The PMU will oversee the implementation of all actions defined \nin the ESMP during the construction stage. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category C). Due \ndiligence confirmed that land access for landing sites and cable stations for Rarotonga and \nAitutaki will use either vacant Crown land or government-leased land, while the cable route will \nbe buried along the easement of a public road. Avaroa Cables will obtain a permit to gain access \nto the Crown land or government-leased land. The government will negotiate an easement \nagreement with the landowners as required by law, and failure to negotiate will not result in \ncompulsory acquisition. The easement process will be validated by a third party acceptable to \nADB. The government has consulted key stakeholders, including communities, and has disclosed \nthe findings of the due diligence. An easement agreement will no longer be required if the existing \nland law is revised before the civil works contract for the landing stations is signed. \n \nF.

The Government of \nNew Zealand has approved its funds, and AFD and EIB are in \nthe advanced stages of approving funds for the project. The \nconstruction and management agreement expected to be signed \nin Q4 2017 will finalize the financing amount. All cofinanciers will \nenter into a memorandum of understanding on the financing \narrangement. \nLand for  the cable  path  and  landing  In any cable project, there is a low land requirement. However, \nstation is not made available in a timely  in  the  Cook  Islands,  even  land  used  for  public  services  is \nmanner  privately owned and requires permission from the landowners for \nany further development. The government is preparing a bill to \nfacilitate  the  use  of  nongovernment-owned  land  for  public \nservices, which is expected to be adopted and become effective \nin Q4 2017. There has been widespread public consultation on \nthis proposal and there is broad acceptance of the need for this \nas per the government. \nImplementation of telecommunications  ADB has provided technical assistance to help the government \nsector reforms is delayed  finalize new legislation for the telecommunications sector, and \nwide  consultations  were  undertaken  in  its  development  to \nengender broad-based support.24 This is expected to be tabled \nin Parliament in Q4 2017.
