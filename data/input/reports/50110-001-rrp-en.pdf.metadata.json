ADB  financing  will  cover  (i)  the  design  and  construction  of  the  spurs  and \nbranching  units  for  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  and  (ii)  the  Cook  Islands\u2019  share  in the  design  and \nconstruction of the MCS. The Government of New Zealand, represented by the Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade, will provide grant cofinancing to the government for the project. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe economy. The Cook Islands\u2019 economy is small and open, and has a narrow base, \nmaking it vulnerable to all kinds of shocks, including disasters triggered by natural hazards. The \nsize and dispersion of the islands over a remote and wide area of ocean reduce opportunities to \nachieve economies of scale.1  Though the population has one of the highest per capita incomes \nin the Pacific ($15,055 in FY2016),2 the free movement of people to New Zealand has led to a \ndeclining and aging population. \n \n4. \nDespite these difficulties, the government has maintained macroeconomic stability. Prices \nhave been relatively stable, goods and services trade has large and persistent surpluses, and the \nfinancial  system  is  sound.  The government  has made significant  investments  in infrastructure. \nEven so, long-term average growth hovers at about 1% (footnote 2). This manifests itself in limited \njob creation and slow growth in government revenue, which can inhibit the provision of essential \nservices and the desired level of social support. \n \nTourism  accounts  for  more  than  60%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  But  its  growth \n5. \npotential  is  constrained  by  shortages  in  accommodation  facilities;  issues  with  the  current  land \nleasing framework;  inadequate water  supply,  sanitation,  and electricity  infrastructure;  and high \ntelecommunications costs. The tourism and public sectors are the biggest internet users. \n \n6. \nConnectivity  and  growth.  Improved  access  to  more  affordable  telecommunications, \nespecially  high-speed  broadband  internet,  may  mitigate  isolation  and  other  constraints  to \neconomic development in the Cook Islands. Based on a World Bank report, every 10-percentage-\npoint  increase  in  broadband  penetration  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries  accelerates \neconomic growth by 1.38 percentage points.3 High-speed internet reduces transaction costs for \n\n                                                \n1  The Cook Islands has Tonga to its west, Kiribati to its north, and French Polynesia to its east. It is surrounded by \nnearly 2 million square kilometers of ocean and has 15 islands with a total land area of 240 square kilometers. There \nare two main island groups: the north consists of seven atolls and the south consists of eight volcanic islands. The \nCook Islands has a population of 19,000, most of whom live on the largest island, Rarotonga. Many of the smaller \nislands are sparsely populated. \n\n2  ADB. 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017: Transcending the Middle-Income Challenge. Manila. \n3  World Bank. 2009. Information and Communications for Development 2009: Extending Reach and Increasing Impact. \n\nWashington, DC. \n\n\fbusinesses,  governments,  and  households;  opens  new  business  opportunities;  and  improves \npublic service delivery by harnessing information and communication technology.4 \n \n7. \nA submarine cable would provide higher capacity and quality broadband internet at much \nlower cost to the Cook Islands than is currently the case, making the internet more accessible \nand affordable to the broader population. This would help Cook Islanders communicate with their \nrelatives  residing  abroad.  Regional  integration  would  also  be  supported  by  increasing  the \nfrequency and quality of communications among countries in the Pacific region, thus increasing \ntrade  in  services (tourism  and  back-office  functions)  and  allowing  the  region  to form  a  sizable \nmarket for digital products and services. It would also strengthen existing regional public goods \nand encourage the development of new forms of regional cooperation by allowing countries to \nbetter share available knowledge and human resources in the Pacific. \n \n8. \nIndustry  structure  and  governance.  Telecom  Cook  Islands  (TCI),  trading  as  Bluesky \nCook Islands (40% government owned and 60% owned by Bluesky Pacific Group),5 is the only \ntelecommunications provider in the Cook Islands. TCI provides 100% geographic coverage for \ntelecommunication in the country and 83% of Cook Islanders with access to mobile data services. \nTCI began using Other Three Billion (O3B) provided service in 2014 to reduce communication \ncosts. Uptake was rapid and capacity is already constrained. Moreover, the service is prone to \nweather  disruption.  The  retail  price,  while  lower  than  that  for  traditional  satellite-based \nconnectivity, is still significantly higher than that for services provided via fiber-optic cables.6 The \nhigh cost of international bandwidth is the principal constraint to higher internet penetration, the \nintroduction of new telecommunications services, and new retail market entrants. \n \nThe  government  is  finalizing  appropriate  legislation  to  regulate  telecommunications  in \n9. \nparallel with development of the cable, so that necessary regulations and institutional structures \nare in place before the cable service becomes operational. The legislation will (i) liberalize the \ntelecommunications market, allowing the entry of interested operators through licensing; and (ii) \nset up an independent regulatory body to manage licensing, tariff setting, service level, resource \nsharing,  and  customer  complaints.  The  legislation  has  gone  through  wide  consultation  and  is \nexpected to be passed by Parliament in November 2017. \n \nRegional approach to internet connectivity. The Cook Islands has recognized the need \n10. \nto improve internet connectivity. A 2012 assessment financed by ADB found the cost of building \na  cable  connection  to  Samoa (the  closest  internet  submarine  cable  connection  point)  was  too \ncostly  to  be  financially  viable  for  the  Cook  Islands  alone.7  Shared  cable  construction  of  a \nsubmarine cable would have reduced the cost borne by the Cook Islands, but this option did not \neventuate given different countries\u2019 (Samoa, French Polynesia) priorities. \n \n11. \nFollowing critical facilitation and support from New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs \nand Trade, in April 2017, the government signed an agreement with the governments of French \nPolynesia, Niue, and Samoa to facilitate the design, construction, and operation and maintenance \nof the MCS. These governments will share the cost of the cable system, estimated at $60 million, \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2017.

This supports e-government feasibility in the Cook Islands. \n5  Amalgamated  Telecom  Holdings, Fiji\u2019s  main  telecommunications  holding  company,  is in  the  process  of  acquiring \n\nBluesky Pacific Group, a telecommunications provider in the Pacific. \n\n6  Prepaid Wi-Fi services are available at different data volume levels. A 1,250-megabyte prepaid package costs NZ$50 \nand a monthly package for 100 gigabytes of data costs NZ$699 per month. No unlimited data plan is available. \n7  ADB. 2013.

Resources  of  the  Samoa  Submarine \nCable Company (SSCC) will finance Samoa\u2019s costs. The Cook Islands\u2019 share of the cost is $20 \nmillion. Avaroa Cables, a newly established limited liability company to own and operate the Cook \nIslands cable system,8 has joined the Project Steering Group (PSG)9 consortium to implement \nand  operate  the  MCS.  Consortium  members  will  enter  into  a  construction  and  maintenance \nagreement (CMA)10 for the MCS, which will include the financing commitments of the consortium \nmembers.11 \n \n12. \nThe PSG\u2019s technical advisor recommended a submarine cable solution connecting Tahiti \nin French Polynesia to Samoa. The Cook Islands and Niue will connect to it through their own \nspurs and branching units. The cable system will provide an additional internet redundancy option \nfor Samoa and French Polynesia. Samoa is currently connected to the system via the American \nSamoa Hawaii Cable to American Samoa and onward to Hawaii, and the Tui-Samoa Cable to Fiji \nthat is under construction. French Polynesia is currently connected via the Honotua cable owned \nby the Office des Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication (OPT). The MCS solution offers the Cook Islands \nan opportunity to share the cable system\u2019s implementation and operating cost. The Cook Islands \nwill  have  access  to  the  technical  and  operational  expertise  of  OPT  and  SSCC  to  run  a  cable \nsystem.  \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for  the \nCook  Islands.12  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  Cook  Islands\u2019  National  Sustainable  Development \nPlan,  2016\u20132020,  which  identified  improving  broadband  connectivity  and  making  broadband \ninternet affordable as key activities under goal 5 (build resilient infrastructure and information and \ncommunication technology to improve the standard of living).13 \n \n14. \nThe  proposed  project  is  the  fourth  ADB  funded  submarine  cable system  in  the  Pacific. \nLesson  from  the  previous  projects  have  been  considered  in  designing  the  technical \nconfigurations,  institutional  arrangements,  and  developing  the  operational  plan  for  the  cable \nsystem. Telecommunications reform undertaken will facilitate the project outcome. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: telecommunications in the Cook Islands \nimproved (footnote 13). The project will have the following outcome: internet service cost reduced \nand quality improved.14 \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n8  Avaroa  Cables\u2019  ownership  comprises  equal  shareholding  by  the  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  the  Cook \nIslands Investment Corporation. This ownership arrangement allows for up to 20% of the company to be held by the \nprivate sector. The government is seeking to attract private shareholders. \n\n9  Other consortium members are the Office des Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication (OPT) in French Polynesia, SSCC in \nSamoa,  and  Telecom  Niue  in  Niue.  ADB  has  completed  integrity  due  diligence  on  the consortium members  and \nidentified no significant integrity risk.  \n\n10 The CMA details the organizational structure, cost-sharing mechanism, roles, and responsibilities of the consortium \nmembers for the MCS. The CMA is critical for the cable system and will be signed before consortium members enter \ninto a works contract with the contractor. \n\n11 The Cook Islands will have 40% capacity share. \n12 ADB. 2016.

Moreover, Avaroa \nCables  will  have  the  opportunity  to  get  support  from  experienced  consortium  members  in \nmanaging cable operations. The configuration will also provide the flexibility for the Cook Islands \nto connect via Samoa or French Polynesia. \n \n26. \nGiven  its  well-established  and  proven  technology,  a  submarine  cable  is  the  preferred, \nmost  cost-effective,  and  most  sustainable  method  for  internet  connectivity.  The  indicative \nlocations  for  cable  landing  stations  are  identified  and  will  be  finalized  after  the  marine  survey \noperation  during  implementation.  In  both  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  the  landing  station  will  be \nconnected to the existing copper and fiber-optic ring system. Local telecommunications providers \nwill be responsible for bringing internet services to the public, offices, and institutions using their \nown infrastructure. The technical design considers the possible impacts due to climate change \nand adopts measure to mitigate it, including through the location of land -based facilities. \n \n27. \nAvaroa Cables will act as the wholesale internet bandwidth provider and will sell to local \ntelecommunications operators in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner, following the Cook \nindependent \nIslands \ntelecommunications regulatory body will be responsible for maintaining internet price and quality. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nFinancial.  In  assessing  the  project\u2019s  financial  viability,  ADB  conservatively  forecasted \ndemand below the region\u2019s average adoption rates, at about 45% average growth during the first \n5 years  after  the  cable comes  into service,  and  then  a steady  decline  to  2%  over  the  next  15 \nyears, which is sustained thereafter for five years. The average annual growth rate over 25-years  \nis estimated at 24%. Avaroa Cables will generate revenues from the wholesaling of broadband \ninternet capacity. ADB evaluated the project\u2019s financial viability by estimating the cash flows from \n\n(under  development).  The \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\ntelecommunications \n\nregulatory  policy \n\n \n\n\foperations  and  calculating  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return.  The  project  cost  was  estimated \nbased on mid-2017 United States dollar prices. Financing charges were excluded for the financial \nevaluation. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return was estimated at 11.20% against the weighted average \n29. \ncost of capital of 6.62%. Cash flows are most sensitive to revenue shocks. To support its financial \nviability,  Avaroa  Cables  must  encourage  demand  growth  through  fair  and  open  access  and \nattractive, transparent pricing for all retail service providers. Financial viability is also sensitive to \na  substantial  capital  cost  overrun,  but  this  risk  is  considered  low  as  cost  estimates  are \nbenchmarked on similar cable development projects in the Pacific. \n \n30. \nEconomic. The analysis used constant 2017 prices and a world price numeraire.  ADB \nadjusted benefits, onshore operating costs, and 60% of costs incurred by domestic retail service \nproviders to economic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.87 and a shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.95. No conversion factors were applied to tradable capital costs. Price reductions at \u2013\n60%  and  a  service  quality  premium  at  +20%  were  considered  for  existing  medium  earth  orbit \nsatellite system internet users. For new customers, willingness to pay corresponds to the entire \narea under their demand curve. \n \n31. \nBenefits are proportional to internet users\u2019 willingness to pay, which is calculated as the \nsum of two components: (i) the annual consumer surplus, estimated at about 0.8% of GDP and \ndetermined through (a) World Bank estimates of comparable demand curves for mobile telephony \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and the Philippines; and (b) estimated consumer surplus \nratios in those countries; and (ii) the annual revenue per user (ARPU) for retail internet services, \nwhich is the product of the mature market ARPU and the projected number of subscribers. The \nmature market ARPU was estimated at 7% of GDP per capita ($84 per subscriber per month in \n2016)  based  on  a  composite  normalized  demand  curve  for  the  same  three  countries,  which \nflattens out at 7% beyond a 15% penetration rate. Benefits are considered to grow in line with real \nGDP growth (assumed at 2.1% per year) and capped at 3.5% of GDP. \n \n32. \nThe project\u2019s economic internal rate of return under the base case scenario is estimated \nat  13.6%,  above  the  minimum  required  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  ADB  investment \nprojects of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis confirms that economic viability is maintained even with a \n20% reduction in projected benefits, a 10% increase in capital expenditure, or a 10% increase in \noperating expenditures. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nFinancial  management.  The  government\u2019s  public  financial  management  performance \nhas  improved  in  terms  of  budget  credibility,  mainly  because  of  better  budget  execution, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting.19  Its  national  accounting  standards  are  generally  consistent  with \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards. The auditing practice is based on international \nstandards, but limited resources constrain timely reporting. The financial management risk is high \nmainly because Avaroa Cables is newly established. During implementation, the PMU will support \nAvaroa  Cables  with  an  experienced  finance  and  accounting  specialist  to  manage  its  financial \naccounting  and  reporting  within  the  first  6  months  of  the  project  effectiveness  date.  ADB  has \nproposed a comprehensive time-bound action plan in the PAM to mitigate the risk. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n19  PEFA.

The  government  has  made  significant  improvements  in  public \n34. \nprocurement  since  2012  in  terms  of  legislation,  regulation,  and  documentation.20  Still,  lack  of \nintegration of functions and limited resources and expertise remain a challenge. The PSG has \nrecruited a consulting firm, funded by its members, to prepare the bidding documents and conduct \nthe bidding process for the MCS. The PSG will work with ADB to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended time to time). As agreed between PSG consortium \nmembers and ADB, ADB will review the bid evaluation report and provide a \u2018no objection\u2019 before \nPSG consortium members sign a contract with the contractor. For the landing station construction \nand  PMU  recruitment,  Avaroa  Cables  will  work  closely  with  ADB  and  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time).  Universal  procurement  will  apply  as  the  ADB  loan  and  New  Zealand  grant  will  jointly \nfinance the procurement and the consulting services packages.21 \n \n35. \nAvaroa Cables has two directors and a secretary in place who will engage staff, including \na chief executive officer, a technical engineer, and an accountant, to run the company\u2019s business \nbefore the cable becomes operational. The PMU will provide training to the new recruits on the \nbusiness  process  and  accounting  standards.  There  will  be  sufficient  overlap  between  Avaroa \nCables staff and PMU consultants to maintain uninterrupted business operation. \n \n36. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n \n37. \nThe project is expected to lower internet costs and make them more affordable to wider \nsegments of the population. It is expected to promote a conducive environment for businesses \nand private investment, which would create employment and income opportunities. \n \nE. \n \n38. \ncategories are as follows.22 \n \n39. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  ADB  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination, \nincluding an environmental and social management plan (ESMP). The project will affect a corridor \nthat is 3\u20134 meters wide, including the footprint of the submarine trenching machine on the seafloor \nin the inner reef zone, and to a depth of 0.75\u20131.00 meters beneath the sediment. The one-off \ndisturbance associated with cable placement is restricted mainly to a strip of seabed less than 2 \nmeters wide. The cable, 4\u20137 centimeters in diameter in the nearshore zone, will be buried as it \npasses  the  natural  channel  through  the  barrier  reef  into  the  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  nearshore \nzone. The key environmental interactions are in the nearshore areas where the cable requires \nburial  to  avoid  potential  entanglement  with  fishing  activities  and  other  human  activities. \nDisturbances  and  impacts  caused  by  cable  laying  and  maintenance  should  be  viewed  in  the \ncontext of the frequency and extent of these activities. The cable route will avoid sensitive habitats \nsuch  as  corals  and  designated  areas.  Experienced  divers  will  place  the  cables  following \ninstructions from the Ministry of Marine Resources. These measures will limit any chance that the \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n20  ADB. 2017.Country and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk Assessment \u2013 Final report.

Unless a cable fault develops, the seabed will \nnot be disturbed again within the system\u2019s design life of about 25 years. \n \n40. \nAvaroa Cables will update the ESMP based on detailed information from the surveys to \nbe  conducted  during  the  project\u2019s  pre-construction  stage.  Any  existing  information  gaps  in the \nbaseline will be filled at this stage. The PMU will oversee the implementation of all actions defined \nin the ESMP during the construction stage. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Due \n41. \ndiligence  confirmed  that  land  access  for  landing  sites  and  cable  stations  for  Rarotonga  and \nAitutaki will use either vacant Crown land or government-leased land, while the cable route will \nbe buried along the easement of a public road. Avaroa Cables will obtain a permit to gain access \nto  the  Crown  land  or  government-leased  land.  The  government  will  negotiate  an  easement \nagreement  with  the  landowners  as  required  by  law,  and  failure  to  negotiate  will  not  result  in \ncompulsory  acquisition. The  easement  process will  be  validated  by  a third party  acceptable to \nADB. The government has consulted key stakeholders, including communities, and has disclosed \nthe findings of the due diligence. An easement agreement will no longer be required if the existing \nland law is revised before the civil works contract for the landing stations is signed. \n \nF. \n \n42. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nLack  of  consortium  financing  delays \nimplementation of the cable system \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nMitigation Measures \nAFD,  EIB,  and  the  Government  of  New  Zealand  are  the  other \ncofinanciers for the Manatua cable system. The Government of \nNew Zealand has approved its funds, and AFD and EIB are in \nthe  advanced  stages  of  approving  funds  for  the  project.  The \nconstruction and management agreement expected to be signed \nin Q4 2017 will finalize the financing amount. All cofinanciers will \nenter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  the  financing \narrangement. \nIn any cable project, there is a low land requirement. However, \nin  the  Cook  Islands,  even  land  used  for  public  services  is \nprivately owned and requires permission from the landowners for \nany further development. The government is preparing a bill to \nfacilitate  the  use  of  nongovernment-owned  land  for  public \nservices, which is expected to be adopted and become effective \nin Q4 2017. There has been widespread public consultation on \nthis proposal and there is broad acceptance of the need for this \nas per the government. \nADB has provided technical assistance to help the government \nfinalize  new  legislation  for  the  telecommunications  sector,  and \nwide  consultations  were  undertaken  in  its  development  to \nengender broad-based support.24 This is expected to be tabled \nin Parliament in Q4 2017.
