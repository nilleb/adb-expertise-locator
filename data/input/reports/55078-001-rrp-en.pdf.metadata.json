THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the COVID-19 Vaccine Support Project under the Asia Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility (APVAX). \n \n2.  The project will provide the Government of Tajikistan with financing for coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) vaccine procurement and logistics and capacity-strengthening activities \nthrough APVAX.1 Tajikistan has met all APVAX access criteria (Table 1). The project investment \ncomponent under APVAX will be utilized. The project will support the implementation of the \nNational Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) to introduce COVID-19 vaccines in Tajikistan \nin line with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDemonstrated adverse  Economic growth slid to 4.5% in 2020 from 7.5% in 2019; fiscal deficit expanded from 3.8% \nimpact of COVID-19   of GDP in 2019 to an estimated 5.2% in 2020; unemployment rose to 6.1% by the end of \n   2020 from 2.0% in early 2020; remittance inflows dropped by an estimated 32.4%, from \n$2.7 billion in 2019 to $1.7 billion, or 22.2% of GDP; volume of foreign trade dropped by \n10.9%; and total public debt grew from 44.9% of GDP in 2019 to 47.3% at the end of 2020. \nCompleted needs  Assessment  of  readiness,  using  WHO\u2019s  COVID-19  Vaccine  Introduction  Readiness \nassessment   Assessment Tool and the World Bank\u2019s Vaccination Readiness Assessment Framework, \nis updated periodically with UNICEF and other development partners\u2019 support. \nNational vaccination   The MOHSPP developed the NDVP in consultation with ministries, institutions, and \nallocation plan   partners.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  The COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n3.  Status of the pandemic. COVID-19 rapidly accelerated into a global pandemic, as \ndeclared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The number of cases grew \nexponentially across countries and continents, resulting in closed borders; travel restrictions; \nlockdowns; national health crises; and disruptions in trade, investment, tourism, and remittance \nflows. Tajikistan confirmed its first 15 cases of COVID-19 on 30 April 2020 and, as of 12 May \n2021, total cases have risen to 13,308 although no new cases have been reported since \nDecember 2020. Tajikistan also confirmed 90 deaths.3 Only 407,841 tests were completed in \nTajikistan up to 28 February 2021, indicating a high probability of undetected cases. The country \nis ill-equipped to handle large-scale health crises and remains highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 \npandemic. Limited testing capacity and absence of strict social distancing and self-isolation \nmeasures have led to increasing pressures in the health system.4  \n \n4.  Country context. Tajikistan is a small, landlocked country in southeastern Central Asia. \nTajikistan is bordered by Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic to the west and north, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China to the east, and Afghanistan to the south. COVID-19, therefore, presents a \nregional challenge that needs coordinated actions. Transit arrangements with neighbors will be \ncritical to maintain trade and tourism flow into the country, as well as ease mobility of migrant \nworkers as remittances are important for the economy, accounting for about a third of gross \ndomestic product (GDP).5 The legacy of the Semashko health system,6 is that the country has a \nsignificantly higher number of physicians, nurses, and hospital beds than average for low-income \ncountries. The system has resulted in significantly better health outcomes compared with income \nlevel (i.e., the measles, mumps, and rubella immunization rate is 97.0%, compared with 62.8% in \nlow-income countries in 2019). However, such a system incurs higher costs and, because \ngovernment financing is limited, results in a disproportionate out-of-pocket burden (68% of current \nhealth expenditure in 2018). \n \n2.  Impact of the Pandemic \n \n5.  Cost for the economy. COVID-19 has significantly weakened the economy as prevention \nmeasures and external factors have slowed domestic consumption and the output of firms, \nincluding micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. COVID-19-related lockdowns adversely \naffected the economy in 2020, where reported growth dropped from 7.5% in 2019 to 4.5% in \n2020.  Growth  deceleration  could  have  been  worse  without  government  support  measures \nassisted by development partners, which exceeded 4.5% of GDP in 2020. COVID-19 has \nsignificant impact on remittances, tourism, and trade, with remittances falling by 14.8% in the first \nhalf of 2020;7 tourism receipts had decreased by 56.0% as of September 2020 (compared with \nthe same period in 2019, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization) as the \n \n3  MOHSPP. Single National Coronavirus (COVID-19) Portal (accessed 12 May 2021). \n4  Tajikistan\u2019s technology infrastructure and employment profile are not well suited to work-from-home measures. \n5  Current US dollars, Atlas method. World Bank. 2020. World Development Indicators (accessed 3 March 2021). \n6  \u201cThe Semashko model was built in the former Soviet Union as a multi-tiered system of care with a strongly \ndifferentiated network of service providers, where each of the five levels corresponded to the severity of the disease \n(district, central rayon, municipal, oblast and federal hospitals) and these were all connected by a sound referral \nsystem\u201d (WHO. 2013. Rocky Road from the Semashko to a New Health Model). \n7  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. \n ", "  3 \n \nnumber of tourist arrivals dropped by 72.0% in 2020; and foreign trade contracted by 10.9% \naccording to the government. \n \n6.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. Tajikistan remains one of the lowest-income \neconomies in Central Asia, with gross national income per capita of $1,030 (Atlas method) in 2019 \n(footnote 5). The national poverty rate is 27.4%; 12% of the population is extremely poor and an \nadditional 46% is classified as vulnerable and at risk of falling into poverty.8 A late 2020 United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) report stated that \u201cincomes from self-employment, \nmigrant labor and non-registered jobs have had the largest declines as a result of the COVID-19 \noutbreak,  the  lack  of  savings  and  the  presence  of  loans  forces  households  into  further \nindebtedness, and there is a high risk of perpetual indebtedness of the sizable proportion of the \npopulation,  and  risking  expansion  and  intensification  of  poverty.\u201d9  Official  data  show  that \nunemployment rates increased from 2.0% in January 2020 to 6.1% in December 2020.10  \n \n7.  Impact on gender. Women are among those most vulnerable to the fallout from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. They are heavily represented among formal (82,842 of 113,899 health \nworkers are women) and informal care workers. External labor migration has affected women\u2019s \neconomic and social well-being. The heavy reliance on remittances has resulted in missed \nopportunities for women in their socio-economic lives and personal aspirations. The UNDP survey \nreport (footnote 9) confirmed that \u201csocial factors negatively affect women\u2019s mobility, education \nand skills and hence exacerbating their vulnerability to COVID-19 impacts; the share of women \nand girls in informal employment is very large; and gender and age disparities are evident with \nwomen and youth at higher risk of long-term unemployment.\u201d  \n \n8.  Impact on the health system. The health system is ill-prepared to deal with a large-scale \nhealth crisis such as COVID-19 and the accompanying surge in demand for medical services, as \nindicated by Tajikistan\u2019s ranking of 130th out of 195 countries in the Global Health Security \nIndex.11 The sector has insufficient resources, and government spending on health is low at 7% \nof general government spending, compared with 12% in the Kyrgyz Republic and a regional \naverage of 16%.12 Out-of-pocket spending accounts for 68% of current health expenditure, and \nper capita current health expenditure is the lowest in the region at $60 in 2018.13 Limited capacity \nin medical management of COVID-19 cases and limited medical supply and access to high-quality \nhealth care are all expected to contribute to the severe impact of COVID-19. Tajikistan has limited \ntesting and contact tracing capacity; only 42 tests per 1,000 population had been conducted as \nof 28 February 2021, compared with 437 in Kazakhstan as of 18 March 2021. COVID-19 cases \nare most likely underreported because of inadequate testing and tracing capacity across the \ncountry. \n \n9.  Initial government measures to control the pandemic. The government implemented \nrapid measures at the start of the global outbreak to prevent the spread of the virus and protect \nthe health system. A task force was established, chaired by the Prime Minister, to determine \nmeasures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and deal with its impacts. The government then \napproved the Tajikistan COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan on 19 March 2020. \nAmong the restrictions imposed included closure of the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China \nin January 2020; prohibition of citizens from five high-risk countries from entering Tajikistan from \n \n8  Poverty figures are sourced from the Tajikistan State Statistical Agency 2018 Household Budget Survey. \n9  UNDP. 2020.

Throughout the \npandemic, TJS1.6 billion of additional funds were allocated from the state budget to the health \nsector to purchase medicines and medical equipment, create temporary hospitals, and support \nhealth workers\u2014an increase of 19% in current health expenditure (TJS1.347 billion in 2018).  \n \n10.  Lessons  learned.  The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Protection  of  the  Population \n(MOHSPP),  the  executing  agency,  has  experiences  in  implementing  projects  funded  by \ndevelopment partners, including ADB, KfW, and the World Bank. The project design is informed \nby best practices learned from recent projects (para. 20). These include: (i) the importance of a \nstrong coordination mechanisms between development partners and the MOHSPP; (ii) the value \nin partnering with agencies such as UNICEF that can provide strong technical support and \nexpertise; and (iii) the need to continue strengthening project management capacity within the \nexecuting agency and/or implementing agency. The project administration group (PAG) of the \nMaternal and Child Health Integrated Care Project (MCHICP) has been implementing the ADB-\nfunded  project  since  2019  and  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  and  due  diligence \nrequirements.14 Strengthening capacity requires a long-term commitment from ADB and should \nbe continued under the proposed project.  \n \n3.  Government\u2019s Response (Needs Assessment and Vaccination Allocation \nPlan) \n \n11.  Needs assessment. Tajikistan is among the youngest countries, with a median age of \njust 22 years. The government will aim for functional immunity through the vaccination of 62.5% \nof  the  population  (e.g.,  all  those  above  the  age  of  18).  The  total  cost  estimate  for  the \nimplementation of the NDVP is $99 million. The amount includes the funding requirements for all \nNDVP components, including vaccines and injection supplies, with an estimated cost of $7 per \ndose. The NDVP will be funded through various sources, including the government; COVID-19 \nVaccines Global Access (COVAX); and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), channeled through the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO. Other donors include ADB, the Agha Khan \nFoundation and World Bank.15  \n \n12.  National Deployment and Vaccination Plan. Through the NDVP, adopted in early \nFebruary 2021, the government aims to protect vulnerable groups, interrupt transmission of \nCOVID-19, protect critical social and routine health services, create and maintain effective \nstakeholder communication during planning and vaccine administration, ensure a high level of \nawareness and regular monitoring of the process, and mobilize the resources and partnerships \nneeded to implement the plan. The MOHSPP developed the NDVP with members from the \nNational  Immunization  Technical  Advisory  Group  (NITAG),  various  agencies  under  the \nMOHSPP, and representatives from development partners. \n \n13.  The NDVP builds on WHO\u2019s Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool and the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Vaccine Readiness Assessment Framework. The NDVP is aligned with the WHO \nStrategic  Advisory  Group  of  Experts  on  Immunization  on  global  COVID-19  policies  and \nstrategies. The first stage will be vaccination of the first and second priority groups. The first (3% \n \n14 ADB. 2018. Tajikistan: Maternal and Child Health Integrated Care Project. Manila. \n15 More details are in the linked document Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "  5 \n \nof the total population or 297,817 people) will include all health workers and people from the 70+ \nage group. The second (7% of the total population or 690,988 people) will include (i) the 60\u201369 \nage  group  and  people  living  with  HIV;  and  (ii)  patients  with  chronic  diseases  (diabetes, \ntuberculosis, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, ischemic heart diseases, and cancer). \nThe second stage will be vaccination of the third priority group (9.41% of the total population or \n876,857 people), consisting of (i) the 50\u201359 age group; (ii) people with chronic kidney disease, \nobesity, immunodeficiency (including posttransplant patients), and neurological diseases; and \n(iii) teachers (employees of educational and science institutions). The third stage will cover the \nremaining 42.5% of the population and will include those who are above 18 but do not fall into \nany of the categories outlined in first two stages. The NDVP was approved by the Regional \nReview Committee of the WHO, which described the NDVP as \u201ca solid and comprehensive plan.\u201d  \n \n14.  The NDVP will be carefully monitored and followed to ensure delivery of vaccines, with \nattention to equity and inclusion. The NDVP\u2019s monitoring system will undertake surveillance with \nthe support of the government\u2019s Republican Center for Immunoprophylaxis (RCIP), which is \nmandated  to  coordinate  and  implement  vaccination-related  activities,  including  planning, \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Locally, regional branches of the RCIP and district \nimmunization centers will report on data using a bottom-up approach, from primary health-care \nfacilities up to the national level. The MOHSPP will utilize the WHO and European Centre for \nDisease Prevention and Control Joint Weekly Data Collection Facility on COVID-19 Vaccine \nDistribution and Vaccine Coverage. Data collection will use The European Surveillance System \n(TESSy) online software, a tool to monitor vaccination in WHO member countries. To ensure \nhigher vaccine uptake and cover the priority groups as planned, the government will enact \nadditional  measures  such  as  vaccination  registers,  reporting  forms,  tally  sheets,  tools  for \nvaccination analysis, an electronic system for registration of vaccination, vaccine tracing and \ndistribution, as well as distribution of injection equipment and supplies, home-based personal \nrecords as reminders for vaccination follow-up, and home visits and reminder phone calls. \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n15.  Tajikistan is a member of the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC),16 one of the \nfour pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator,17 under WHO.18 As a beneficiary \nof COVAX AMC, Tajikistan is eligible to receive vaccines for 20% of the population.19 ADB\u2019s \nproposed grant of $25 million is one of a series of APVAX projects in Central Asia, which will \nsupport procurement and transport of vaccines, operating expenses, a demand generation \ncampaign, and training, and fully complement the assistance of other development partners. The \nMOHSPP is working closely with development partners to mobilize funding and ensure close \ncoordination in delivering priority assistance for the COVID-19 response.20 The first round of \n \n16  Gavi launched COVAX-AMC in June 2020. It is an innovative financing instrument that aims to support the \nparticipation of 92 low- and middle-income economies in COVAX, which enables them to access donor-funded doses \nof safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Together with support for country readiness and delivery, COVAX AMC \nwill ensure that the most vulnerable in all countries can be protected in the short term, regardless of income level (S. \nBerkley. The Gavi COVAX AMC Explained. Gavi).  \n17 Launched in April 2020, the ACT Accelerator, is a groundbreaking global collaboration to accelerate development, \nproduction, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It is organized into four pillars: \ndiagnostics, treatment (therapeutics), vaccines, and health system strengthening (WHO. COVAX). Each pillar is vital \nto the overall effort and involves innovation and collaboration (WHO. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) \nAccelerator). \n18 The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi, WHO, and the World Bank.  \n19 In March 2021, 192,000 of the 624,000 expected doses of AstraZeneca vaccines under the COVAX facility have \nbeen delivered to Tajikistan. As of May 2021, about 74,000 individuals have been vaccinated with at least one dose. \n20 Donor Coordination Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \n \nvaccines for 20% of the population will be financed through COVAX AMC for about $30 million. \nCOVAX will support the government with additional cold chain equipment funded through Gavi, \nand with technical assistance through WHO and UNICEF. The UNICEF and WHO will help the \ngovernment with NDVP measures such as cold chain assessment, waste management, and \ncapacity building. The World Bank added $8.63 million to its Tajikistan Emergency COVID-19 \nProject,  which  will  support  the  purchase  of  additional  vaccines  through  COVAX,  personal \nprotective equipment (PPE), in-country transport, a demand generation campaign, training, \ndatabase management, supervision, and monitoring.21 The Aga Khan Foundation has committed \nfinancing  of  $0.24  million  for  medical  supplies  (PPE,  cold  chain  equipment,  and  program \nmanagement). Discussions are ongoing with development partners to fill the financing gap (about \n$32.5 million) to vaccinate all those above 18 years old (62.5% of the population).  \n \nB.  Project Description   \n \n16.  The project responds to the government\u2019s request for ADB support under APVAX to help \nmeet COVID-19 vaccine response challenges. In accordance with the guidance provided in \nAppendix 5 of the APVAX policy, the project investment component under APVAX will support \nADB\u2019s procurement and project implementation, which will benefit Tajikistan given due diligence \nassessments that identified fiduciary-related risks (footnote 1).  \n \n17.  Impacts and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) vulnerable \ngroups are protected from morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19;22 and (ii) the spread of \nthe  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV-2)  is  reduced,23  and \nconfidence of citizens is restored.24 The project\u2019s outcome is priority populations are vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19.25 The project outputs are described below. \n \n18.  Output  1.  COVID-19  vaccine  procured  and  delivered  to  designated  points.  \nThe project will provide financing to procure vaccines through COVAX AMC with support from \nUNICEF  as  the  procurement  agent  through  a  turnkey  service.  The  project  will  support \nprocurement of about 3 million doses (assuming 2 doses per person), which will be sufficient to \nvaccinate more than 1. 3 million people or about 14% of the population. The expenditure items \nwill include (i) vaccines that meet any of the eligibility requirements of the APVAX policy,26 \nincluding advance payments; (ii) safety boxes, syringes, and other items required to administer \nthe vaccines; and (iii) international and national logistics and related services required to transport \nvaccines from the place of purchase to national, regional, and district health facilities. \n  \n19.  Output 2. Vaccination program implementation capacity strengthened. The output \nwill help strengthen the MOHSPP\u2019s capacity to effectively and efficiently manage procurement \nand delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, and develop and conduct information, education, and \ncommunication campaigns and outreach programs with tailored messages for the different target \ngroups using gender- and age-sensitive approaches. The capacity-strengthening activities will \nbe coordinated with regional technical assistance under the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) framework to support information and knowledge sharing with other \n \n21  World Bank. 2020.

ADB value addition. The project is integral to ADB\u2019s support for Tajikistan\u2019s COVID-19 \nresponse. ADB provided $50 million through the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure \nSupport Program,28 and a $2.5 million grant through the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to \npurchase medical supplies for COVID-19. For the quick purchase of medical supplies and PPE \nfor health-care staff, ADB provided about $1 million sourced from regional technical assistance,29 \nand reallocation from the ongoing MCHICP (footnote 14). The CAREC RETA (footnote 26) \nsupports  the  project\u2019s  behavior  change  communication,  among  others.  Through  targeted \nassistance in 2020, ADB has established monitoring mechanisms to ensure that its support \ncovers the most vulnerable groups and promotes gender-sensitive approaches.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s involvement in health is not limited to vaccination; ADB is a main partner and key \nfinancier of the health sector. The MCHICP ($32 million) focuses on integrating health care and \nstrengthening health systems. Reinforcing the government\u2019s efforts is crucial value addition that \nallows for holistic ADB support to fight COVID-19. The MCHICP has innovative components that \npilot critical interventions in maternal and child health. For instance, the project\u2019s behavior change \ncommunication component has a prospective impact evaluation design to rigorously examine \nwhat route of information campaigns is most effective in routine immunization of children. \nLessons  from  these  experiments  will  be  incorporated  into  the  design  of  behavior  change \ncommunication and social mobilization campaigns for COVID-19 vaccination and future health \noperations. Sustained support to the health sector is a good platform from which to pursue ADB\u2019s \ngender mainstreaming efforts, given the significant role and participation of women in the sector. \nWith global health interconnectedness highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the call for \nregional approaches is heightened. Through the CAREC Program, ADB has been expediting \nregional dialogue and knowledge sharing on mitigating risks at borders, including a $4.35 million \nregional technical assistance (footnote 26) to support the formulation of a CAREC health strategy \nleading to 2030. At the 19th CAREC Ministerial Conference, Tajikistan, together with its partners \nin the CAREC Program, reaffirmed its commitment to regional cooperation to face the challenges \nposed by the pandemic.  \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $26.8 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).30 \nThe major expenditure items that constitute the project are the purchase and delivery of COVID-\n19 vaccines that meet APVAX eligibility criteria, goods, and consulting services to develop the \nMOHSPP\u2019s capacity.  \n \n \n \n \n27  ADB. 2020.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  Project organization structure. The MOHSPP will be the project\u2019s executing agency. \nThe implementing agency will be the ongoing ADB project PAG, which will be augmented with \nconsultants. The PAG, headed by a project director, will be appointed by the MOHSPP. The \nproject director will be supported by a national coordinator, who will oversee the day-to-day \nimplementation  supported  by  six  regional  coordinators  or  vaccination  specialists.  The \ncoordinators (national and regional) and other key PAG staff (gender, procurement, financial \nmanagement and disbursement, monitoring and evaluation, waste management, translation) will \nbe selected through a competitive procedure and financed by the project under the recurrent cost \ncategory. Auditing firms (financial and performance) will be engaged to ensure comprehensive \nfiduciary assurance to ADB on overall project delivery. A consulting firm will be engaged to handle \nimpact assessment, including a satisfaction survey among vaccine recipients, and third-party \nmonitoring. The roles, responsibilities, and draft terms of reference for staff and consultants who \n ", "  9 \n \nwill support the MOHSPP and the PAG are described in the PAM. Implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 4. \n \n25.  Governance structure. The project\u2019s oversight and implementation arrangements are \nanchored on the government\u2019s governance structure. The project will be guided by the directives \nof the national multisectoral COVID-19 task force chaired by the Prime Minister. The MOHSPP \nhas the overall mandate to implement the NDVP. The responsibility for strategic decision-making \non COVID-19 vaccine introduction is under the NITAG, with members from the State Sanitary \nEpidemiological Surveillance Service, the RCIP, the Republican Healthy Lifestyle Center, and \nthe Republican Center for Medical Statistics and Information. Development partners such as \nADB, the Aga Khan Foundation, Gavi, UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank will meet regularly to \nensure  timely  implementation  of  the  NDVP.  The  well-established  country-wide  institutional \nmechanisms will be used to execute the vaccination plan.  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2021\u2013June 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2023 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 December 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  National Inter ministerial or Intersectoral COVID-19 task force chaired by the Prime \nMinister with participation of relevant ministries \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population  \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population PAG \nProcurement  Direct contracting to UNICEF for  1 contract  $21,776,501 \nvaccine supply, safety boxes, \nsyringes, and other related items, \nand delivery to designated points \nPAG office equipment and furniture  1 contract  $22,913 \nConsulting Services   PAG staff for APVAX   Multiple contracts  $300,000 \n  CQS (performance auditor firm)  1 contract  $60,000 \n  LCS (project financial auditing firm)  1 contract  $20,000 \nCQS (firm for impact assessment  1 contract  $38,800 \nand/or third-party monitoring firm) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Grant funds may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures incurred before grant \nadvance contracting   effectiveness, subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 30% of the grant amount, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred after the allocation by the government of \nresources to respond to the COVID-19 emergencya but not earlier than 12 months \nbefore the date of the grant agreement, and provided that disbursement conditions \nare met. \nThe issuance of (i) invitations for bids and (ii) consulting services recruitment notices \nunder advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval.  \nDisbursement   The grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, APVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nCQS = consultants\u2019 qualification selection, LCS = least-cost selection, PAG = project administration group, UNICEF = \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund. \na  On 30 March 2020, the national government approved the allocation of resources in support of the disaster response \nefforts to fight COVID-19 and indicated that external assistance was welcome. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n26.  The RCIP is mandated to coordinate and implement immunization-related activities, \nincluding planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The vaccines will be delivered \nthroughout the country, from the central vaccine store in Dushanbe to 5 regional zones, 63 district \n ", "10   \n \nstores, 888 rural health centers, 52 district health centers, 48 city health centers, 22 family \nmedicine centers, 13 family medicine ambulatories, 20 medical posts, and 1,742 health houses. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s standard due diligence requirements for processing sovereign operations have \nbeen applied. \n \nA.   Economic and Financial Analysis  \n \n28.  The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, causing loss of lives \nand a major economic downturn arising from the introduction of containment measures that \nrestrict economic activities and an economy-wide slowdown in investment and international trade. \nReducing morbidity and mortality of vaccinated vulnerable populations will not only quickly ease \nstress on hospital activities but also help contain and diminish the spread of the virus across \nborders and complement response efforts in Tajikistan\u2019s neighbors. Reducing morbidity and \nmortality will create a joint enabling environment to expedite the return of normal cross-border \nactivities, contributing to economic growth in Tajikistan and its neighbors. A project financial \nviability assessment was not undertaken since project outputs are not meant to produce cost \nrecovery direct revenue. Basic public health services are provided in Tajikistan free of charge. \nThe government has allocated only 6.8%\u20138.4% of the national budget to health care since 2016, \nwith a forecast allocation up to 2024 that will cover only general and other health-care projects. If \nexpected  development  partner  support  does  not  continue,  the  vaccination  program\u2019s  fiscal \nsustainability will be at risk.31  \n \nB.   Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n \n29.  Tajikistan has taken steps to fight corruption, including establishing specialized bodies to \ncontrol utilization of budget resources (the Agency of State Financial Control and Combating \nCorruption, and the Chamber of Accounts), and adopting and implementing the comprehensive \nAnticorruption Strategy 2013\u20132020, which is being updated and was aligned with the National \nDevelopment  Strategy  2030,  among  others.  The  two  specialized  bodies  annually  audit  all \ngovernment organizations that receive budget allocations. Internal control and audit departments in \nline ministries, including in the MOHSPP, also monitor the use of resources. The MOHSPP is guided \nby its own anticorruption strategy (section 7: preventing corruption in education and health care). \nThe Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment for 2017 supported by the World \nBank shows that some improvements had been made since 2012 in four of six pillars, including \ncontrol and transparency of budget execution, accountability, and reporting.32 According to ADB\u2019s \ncountry  performance  assessment  for  2020,  the  score  for  public  sector  management  and \ninstitutions  did  not  improve  significantly,  and  the  score  of  2.5  out  of  6  for  transparency, \naccountability, and control of corruption in the public sector had not changed since 2016. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the MOHSPP. Under output 2 and in the areas of financial management and \nprocurement (discussed below), steps are being taken to ensure sufficient governance of the \nproject. The risk assessment and risk management plan (Table 5) includes governance-related \nrisks and mitigating measures developed with inputs from ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and \nIntegrity. \n \n \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  Government of Tajikistan. 2017.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n31.  Environment (category C). The COVID-19 vaccination will result in a temporary increase \nof hazardous health-care waste (used syringes, needles, PPE, etc.) at service points. Minimal \nenvironmental impacts are envisaged as the waste will be disposed of in accordance with the \nstandard operating procedure on disposal of medical waste after vaccination against COVID-19 \n(approved on 6 March 2021 by the MOHSPP), which was reviewed and confirmed to be adequate \nby ADB, as well as the requirements of relevant national legislation and regulations. Management \nof  incremental  waste  generated  from  this  activity  will  be  monitored  to  ensure  proper \nimplementation of the standard operating procedure.34 \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not \nentail any physical intervention that would cause involuntary resettlement or impact indigenous \npeoples and thus is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \nD.   Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n33.  Poverty  and  social  considerations.  The  project  supports  reducing  poverty  with \nmeasures to safeguard health to allow people to resume their livelihoods.35 Overall food security \ndeteriorated during the pandemic across a range of indicators, with rising numbers of people \nreporting going hungry, reducing dietary diversity, worrying about obtaining enough food, being \nless able to pay for utilities, and coping by selling assets and reducing spending on medical care. \n  \n34.  Gender. Most of the groups prioritized for vaccination, i.e., health workers, the elderly, \nand teachers, are predominantly women. While the prioritization plan bodes well for women, \nsocial and physical barriers could keep them from fully enjoying the benefits of vaccination, such \nas limited decision-making power in the household and inadequate gender awareness of health \nworkers. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming as it tackles these gender \nissues through demand-raising community campaigns, for example, that include gender-sensitive \nmessages targeting women\u2019s and men\u2019s concerns on the benefits of vaccination.36 The project \nconducts gender sensitivity training for health workers to enable them to administer the vaccines \nin a culturally appropriate way that respects beneficiaries\u2019 gender, class, and preconceived \nnotions. Gender-sensitive messages and clear information on the vaccines and post-vaccine \nprocedures, including how to treat symptoms that follow vaccinations, will help health workers \nensure that beneficiaries are fully informed. Vaccination sites will be set up with consideration \ngiven to women\u2019s need for privacy and security from harassment. To resolve issues related to \nmobility, decision-making power, and financial constraints that women in remote and rural areas \nexperience, 196 mobile teams will be deployed to administer vaccines to women and men from \nthe targeted population groups in those locations. The project will conduct a satisfaction survey \non the vaccinated population to assess the gender-sensitive approaches to vaccination, and \ndevelop a sex-disaggregated database of the priority groups for vaccination.  \n \n \n33  ADB. 2009.

Financial Due Diligence  \n \n35.  Financial management. The financial management assessment concluded that the \noverall pre-mitigated financial management risk of the project is high, owing in part to the risks \nassociated  with  the  weak  public  financial  management  system,  inadequate  institutional \ngovernance and internal control system, and limited experience with ADB-funded projects. To \ncorrect  these  shortcomings,  the  following  mitigation  measures,  as  presented  in  the  PAM \ntimebound financial management action plan, were discussed and agreed with the MOHSPP: (i) \nfinancial management consultants and disbursement consultant engaged to support MOHSPP, \n(ii)  training  provided  by  ADB  to  MOHSPP  PAG  staff  on  ADB  financial  management  and \ndisbursement guidelines and policies, (iii) PAG staff with ADB or World Bank project experience \ndeployed, (iv) an information system to monitor project implementation operationalized, (v) \ninternal controls and financial reporting strengthened, (vi) independent auditors conduct project \nfinancial  reporting  audit  and  performance  audit,  and  (vii)  an  inventory  information  system \noperationalized. \n \nF.  Procurement  \n \n36.   Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).37 \nFollowing the APVAX policy (footnote 1), ADB member country eligibility restrictions will be \nwaived and universal procurement apply. UNICEF will be engaged through direct contracting as \na turnkey procurement agent to handle all aspects of goods and logistics procurement. The task \nwill include procurement of vaccines and ancillary items through COVAX, along with transport \nand logistics from origin to final destinations throughout Tajikistan. Goods and logistics services \nwill be procured in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply Manual.38 The use of direct contracting as \nthe procurement method is well justified since most vaccine contracts are being entered into \nglobally through UNICEF under COVAX. UNICEF has the resources to immediately provide \nservices through COVAX and is best positioned to navigate the quickly evolving vaccine market. \nUNICEF  has  been  procuring  routine  immunizations  for  Tajikistan  since  2004  and  is  well \npositioned to handle in-country logistics, and UNICEF\u2019s cold chain experience is critical for the \nsafe handling of vaccines. \n \n37.   Value for money in procurement will be achieved by (i) selecting candidate vaccine types \nthat are best suited to the domestic logistics supply chain and distribution mechanisms; (ii) \nidentifying vaccines that will meet project disbursement conditions; (iii) engaging a procurement \nagent who has direct contact with manufacturers who can ascertain vaccine availability and \ndelivery timelines; and (iv) entering into agreements on terms and conditions that are reasonable, \nnoting the currently constrained global market for vaccines. ADB will provide financing for vaccine \nprocurement only once the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria have been met (footnote 25). \n \n \n37 Strategic Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 ADB. 2010.

Under this Board-approved paper, ADB agrees to the use of UNICEF\u2019s \nSupply Manual and UNICEF\u2019s Human Resources Manual for the procurement of associated goods, equipment, and \nservices (including consulting services); and the procurement of goods, equipment, and services in a nonmember \ncountry or the procurement of goods, equipment, and services produced in a nonmember country. Administrative \narrangements, including on procurement, for ADB\u2013UNICEF project cooperation are spelled out in the memorandum \nof understanding between UNICEF and ADB dated October 2018.  \n ", "  13 \n \n38.  All cold chain equipment, from the national to the district level, are prequalified by WHO. \nAll other procurement requirements (Table 4) will be handled by the MOHSPP per the approved \nprocurement plan in the PAM. \n \nG.
