The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.   \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\nIn  response  to  the  PRC's  greater  role  in  promoting  low-carbon  and  sustainable \n2. \ndevelopment  in  the  international  community,  clean  energy  has  been  a target  area  in  business \ndevelopment  in  the  PRC  since  2006.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  first  private  sector \nwind  power  project  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funded  by  local  currency  bonds1 \ngenerated  considerable  interest  among  sponsors  of  wind  power  projects  and  financial \ninstitutions,  as  lack  of  access  to  finance  has  been  a  bottleneck  for  wind  power  development. \nPersistent  barriers  to  the  financing of  wind  power  projects  include  (i)  the  intermittence  of  wind \nenergy, as availability depends on nature and cannot always be guaranteed; (ii) the large, front-\nloaded  development  and  capital  costs  for  wind  power  projects,  requiring  loans  with  longer \nmaturity  than  is  available  in  the  commercial  market;  and  (iii)  the  small  scale  of  most  wind \nprojects, making transaction costs for project finance disproportionately high.  \n \nCWP has invested in 22 wind power plants with a total capacity of 1.2 gigawatts (GW) \n3. \nand has secured development rights for up to 1.3 GW in Jilin Province. Under project approvals \nfrom the government, CWP is responsible for seeking financing to cover the entire costs of its \nnew projects. Lack of access to flexible financial packages has impeded the company's project \ndevelopment, particularly in Jilin, where private sector wind development has lagged. CWP thus \nrequested ADB to take the lead in arranging the financing package for multiple projects, relying \non  ADB\u2019s  structuring  skill.  Through  due  diligence,  ADB  determined  that  the  proposed  project \nsupports ADB\u2019s strategies regarding environmental sustainability, inclusive growth, financial and \ntechnical feasibility, potential for carbon reduction, and demonstration impact. \n \nB. \n\nSector Background  \n\n1. \n\nWind Power in the PRC \n\n4. \nThe  PRC  is  Asia\u2019s  largest  consumer  of  energy  and  ranked  second  in  the  world  as  an \nenergy consumer. By 2015, the PRC\u2019s energy  sector will need investments of $50 billion\u2013$70 \nbillion per annum, more than double past rates of investment. Coal has historically been the fuel \nof choice, as abundant reserves exist throughout the country. Three-quarters of electricity and \n69% of primary energy is derived from burning coal. The heavy use of coal can cause severe \nlocal  impacts  such  as  resource  depletion,  environmental  deterioration,  and  pollution-related \nhealth effects. Sulfur dioxide emissions\u201470% of which are from coal burning\u2014cause acid rain \non  about  one-third  of  the  country's  landmass.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions\u201480%  of  which  are \nfrom  coal  burning\u2014outstrip  those  of  other  countries  and  are  seen  as  a  global  environmental \nissue.  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for the Inner \n\nMongolia Wind Power Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n5. \nThe  PRC  has  a  total  exploitable  wind  energy  reserve  of  4,350  GW,  one  of  the  world\u2019s \nlargest. Of this, 1,000 GW onshore and 200 GW offshore can be commercially developed with \nexisting  technologies.  Over  one-quarter  of  the  PRC\u2019s  land  area  has  been  classified  as  \u201cwind \nrich\u201d or \u201crelatively wind rich\u201d by official meteorological surveys. The richest wind resources are in \nthe north and in southeastern coastal areas. Nevertheless, wind power still has an insignificant \nshare  in  the  nation\u2019s  overall  power  mix,  accounting  for  only  3%  of  generation  capacity  and  a \nmeager 1.5% of total electricity output in 2009. \n \n6. \nThe  government  has  committed  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  acted  to \nchange the country's pattern of energy use to better balance economic growth and environmental \nprotection.  This  commitment  is  reflected  in  the  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Development  Plan  for \nRenewable  Energy  in  China,  promulgated  in  August  2007,  in  which  one  of  the  most  prominent \ntargets  is  to  increase  renewable  energy\u2019s  share  of  electricity  generation  to  15%  by  2020.2 In \nDecember  2009,  the  government  announced  plans  to  cut  carbon  intensity  (carbon  dioxide \nemissions per unit of economic output), targeting a 40%\u201345% reduction from 2005 levels by 2020. \nGiven  the  expected  long-term  growth  in  PRC  energy  demand,  major  cuts  in  carbon  intensity \nrequire a significant expansion of lower-carbon energy technologies such as wind.     \n \n7. \nNational  targets  for  wind  power  capacity  in  the  Medium-  and  Long-term  Development \nPlan for Renewable Energy in China were originally 5 GW by 2010 and 30 GW by 2020. The \ngoal for 2010 was achieved 3 years early in 2007 and was thus lifted to 10 GW. As of 2009, the \nChina Electricity Council estimated that total installed wind power capacity has reached 21 GW. \nThe  government  now  aims  to  install  150  GW  of  wind  power  by  2020,  meaning  that  12  GW  of \nwind power needs to be installed per year on average for 10 years between 2011 and 2020.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulatory Framework \n\nSince  the  early  2000s,  the  government  has  instituted  a  series  of  renewable  energy \n8. \npolicies toward rural development, industrial development, environmental protection, and energy \nsecurity goals. As a whole, these policies (i) clarify the strategic objective of renewable energy \ndevelopment,  (ii)  remove  market  barriers,  (iii)  help  to  create  a  social  and  cultural  environment \nconducive  to  renewable  energy  development,  and  (v)  promote  the  commercialization  and \ndevelopment of renewable energy.  \n \n9. \nThe Renewable Energy Law, 2005 and amended in 2009 stipulates financial incentives \nfor  renewable  energy  projects,  reduces  risks  for  project  developers  by  mandating  power  grid \ninterconnection  and  full  power  off-take,  and  provides  guaranteed  minimum  prices  for  certain \ntypes  of  renewable  energy.  For  wind  power  projects  approved  by  the  government,  the \nRenewable Energy Law requires that (i) the grid utility be responsible for the timely construction \nof transmission lines to connect the wind farms to the nearest grid; (ii) the grid utility purchase \nall the electricity generated by the wind farms; (iii) the tariff for uploading electricity to the power \ngrid be determined through a nationwide concession bidding process, taking into consideration \npower  generation  costs,  loan  repayments,  and  a  reasonable  profit;  (iv)  the  gap  between  the \nwind  electricity  tariff  and  the  average  electricity  tariff  be  shared  across  the  whole  power  grid \nthrough a levy on each kilowatt-hour of electricity sold to the end users. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   National Development and Reform Commission. 2007. Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable \n\nEnergy in China. Beijing.  \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nIn July 2009, the government further adopted fixed feed-in tariffs for new onshore wind \n10. \npower farms, replacing the previous competitive bidding process, which put private wind power \ndevelopers at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the large state-owned power generation companies. This \ntariff reform significantly enhances transparency and efficiency in tariff determination, removes \nprocedural uncertainties, and fosters the confidence of project sponsors and finance providers. \nAll  feed-in  tariffs  are  set  at  a  uniform  level  by  region,  determined  by  that  region\u2019s  wind \nresources. \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n11.  While  PRC  wind  projects  have  a  wide  range  of  developers,  the  dominant  players  are \nlarge state-owned conventional power generation companies. The 10 largest developers, which \ntogether controlled 76% of installed wind capacity in 2009, include Guodian (18.8% of installed \nwind  capacity),  Datang  (12.6%),  Huaneng  (11.9%),  Huadian  (8.9%),  and  China  Power \nInvestment (2.3%). For these companies, the motivation to develop wind projects stems in part \nfrom  quota  regulations  requiring  3%  of  capacity  from  renewable  sources  by  2010  and  8%  by \n2020.3 As a result, many wind projects in the PRC have been developed with low margins that \nare  cross-subsidized  by  other  assets  or  with  relatively  low  utilization,  as  renewable  energy \nquotas  are  based  on  installed  capacity,  not  power  generated.  Further  private  sector \nparticipation, which has been insignificant so far, is expected to improve operational efficiency \nand  play  an  important  role  in  achieving  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  150  GW  of  installed  wind \npower capacity by 2020. \n \n12. \nFinancing has been a key constraint on private wind developers\u2019 scaling up operations. \nFor  domestic  loans,  local  banks  typically  prefer  to  lend  to  large  state-owned  firms  employing \nconventional  power  generation  technologies,  and  are  averse  to  lending  to  emerging  private \nsector  alternative  energy  companies.  Private  companies  also  have  difficulty  tapping  the \nenterprise  bond  market,  as  bond  issuance  in  the  PRC  is  time-consuming,  complicated,  and \nsubject  to  various  approvals.  Private  renewable  energy  developers  are  increasingly  forced  to \ntap  other,  more  expensive  forms  of  financing  such  as  equity  and  trusts.  As  a  further \ncomplication, project companies are typically required to commence the construction of a wind \nproject within a relatively short period after the award of development rights.  \n \n\n4. \n\nJilin Province \n\n13. \nJilin  Province  offers  strong  potential  as  a  base  for  developing  wind  power.  Affected  by \nSiberian cold fronts and high atmospheric pressure in Mongolia, the province\u2019s wind resources \nare among the best in the PRC, especially in the western areas of the province bordering Inner \nMongolia.  Jilin  has  implemented  a  low-carbon  development  strategy,  provincial  emissions \nreduction  targets,  renewable  energy  utilization  targets,  and  environmental  dispatch  practices. \nThe  province  has  put  in  place  for  2020  a  wind  capacity  target  of  20  GW,  an  almost  tenfold \nincrease from the 2009 installed base of 2.1 GW. Nonetheless, wind investment from the private \nsector  is  lagging;  the  five  largest  state-owned  generators  account  for  nearly  70%  of  wind \ninstallations.  Jilin\u2019s  2010\u20132020  economic  plan  notes  the  contribution  that  private  sector \ninvestment can make toward achieving clean energy goals.4 \n \n\n                                                 \n3  The medium- and long-term renewable energy development plan requires power companies with installed capacity \nabove 5 GW to have non-hydro renewable energy account for at least 3% of capacity by 2010 and 8% by 2020. \n\n4   Jilin Provincial Government. 2010. Jilin Province 2010\u20132020 Industrial Development Plan. Changchun. \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nJilin  is  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  northern  PRC.  Per  capita  income  in  Jilin  in \n14. \n2008  was  CNY23,514,  on  par  with  that  of  neighboring  Heilongjiang  (CNY21,727)  but \nsignificantly  below  those  of  Inner  Mongolia  (CNY32,214)  and  Liaoning  (CNY31,259),  and  far \nbelow  those  of  the  PRC\u2019s  wealthier  areas  such  as  Beijing  (CNY63,029)  and  Shanghai \n(CNY73,124). Traditionally a center of heavy industry, Jilin remains reliant on large state-owned \nmanufacturing: state-owned firms\u2019 output was more than double that of private firms in 2008, 5 \nand their fixed investment more than 4 times greater.  Foreign investment was $17.5 billion in \n2008,  or  0.8%  of  the  PRC  total,  which  was  well  below  the  province\u2019s  2.1%  share  of  national \nGDP.6 Remote  areas  of  the  province,  such  as  those  targeted  for  wind  site  development,  are \nunderdeveloped in terms of industry, with local communities relying on herding and farming. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n15. \nStrategy 2020 emphasizes support for achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth \nthrough environmentally sustainable development and private sector development.7 The project \nis consistent with the strategy, which identifies infrastructure and environment as two of the five \ncore areas in which ADB will employ its financial and institutional resources to maximize results, \nefficiency, and impact. In terms of infrastructure, specifically energy, the project will embody the \nstrategy,  which  sets  forth  that  ADB  will  (i)  help  expand  the  supply  of  energy  and  (ii)  support \nclean energy. With respect to the environment, the project is in line with the strategy's focus on \n(i) climate change, (ii) livable cities, and (iii) complementary actions. The strategy also aims to \npromote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in  financing  infrastructure  by  supporting  public\u2013\nprivate partnership. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy  is  based  on  four  development  pillars: \n16. \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.8 The project reinforces each of these pillars, with particular support \nto pillars (ii), (iii), and (iv), and will be integral to ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts to help improve the use \nof renewable and clean energy in the PRC.  \n \n17. \nThe  PRC  has  been  steadily  turning  to  development  that  is  market  oriented  and  led  by \nthe  private  sector,  which  has  become  the  driving  force  of  economic  growth  and  job  creation. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental improvement, building on ADB\u2019s public sector policy advice to the government on \nprivate  sector  development.  Regarding  infrastructure  and  energy,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering \nprojects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and  improve  corporate  governance.  As  agreed \nwith the government, ADB\u2019s private sector operations focus on viable projects located in less-\ndeveloped  regions  and  explore  the  possibility  of  loans  funded  by  ADB\u2019s  yuan-denominated \nbonds. As a financially strong project focused mainly on relatively underdeveloped areas of Jilin, \n\n                                                 \n5   Gross industrial output was CNY406.4 billion for state-owned firms and CNY181 billion for private firms. \n6   National Bureau of Statistics. 2009.

The policy \nrequires  ADB  to  help  developing  member  countries  provide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable \nenergy for inclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. It \nsets  out  three  pillars  for  policy  implementation:  (i)  promoting  energy  efficiency  and  renewable \nenergy;  (ii)  maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all;  and  (iii)  promoting  energy  sector  reform, \ncapacity building, and governance. The proposed project is in line with the policy, as the further \ndevelopment of wind power will enhance access to clean energy. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n19. \nThe  project  will  support  CWP  in  building  a  series  of  wind  farms  in  Jilin  and  other \nprovinces in the northern PRC where private sector participation is limited and abundant wind \nresources are underutilized.  \n \n20. \nCWP will utilize the ADB assistance to fund, through TXWP and XWP, a series of wind \nfarm projects with total production capacity of up to 800 MW by 2013. The portfolio approach, \nbroad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for multiple wind farm projects that \nare  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  ADB  or  international  banks  to  finance on  a  stand-\nalone basis. \n \n\n1. \n\n The Sponsor  \n\n21. \nCWP,  the  sponsor,  is  a  private  company  specializing  in  wind  power  operations  in  the \nPRC. Following the government\u2019s policy to encourage private sector investment in wind power, \nCWP was founded by a team of senior managers with strong experience in wind power in the \nPRC  and  a  good  reputation.  CWP  has  grown  rapidly  to  establish  itself  as  a  leading  private \ncompany in the PRC wind industry. It was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in July 2007 \nand is currently 44.6% owned by public shareholders.  \n \n22. \nCWP  is  organized  into  two  main  business  groups:  (i)  wind  project  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  management  and  (ii)  wind  farm  project  investment.  The \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  management  group  includes  one  of  the  largest \nunits  for  manufacturing  wind  power  tubes  in  the  PRC,  as  well  as  units  providing  service  and \nexpertise  in  wind  project  design,  including  wind  resource  assessment,  feasibility  studies,  and \nengineering design.  \n \n23. \nCWP has invested in 22 wind farms with aggregate capacity of 1.2 GW and has secured \ndevelopment rights for 1.3 GW in Jilin. This substantial pipeline allows CWP to select projects \nbased on favorable grid conditions and other factors, facilitating stable and fast development. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrowers \n\n24. \nXWP  and  XWP,  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  CWP,  are  holding  companies  for  CWP's \nwind  farm  operations.  TXWP  is  registered  as  a  foreign-invested  enterprise  and  has  dual \ncurrency, US dollar\u2013yuan borrowing capacity, while XWP is registered as a PRC enterprise and \ncan borrow only in yuan.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Design \n\n25. \nThe project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing medium-sized wind power \nprojects,  which  involves  relatively  high  transaction  costs  for  financing.  ADB  and  CWP  aim  to \nfinance a series of wind farm projects on a portfolio basis to reduce financing transaction costs \nand diversify the wind resource risk.  \n \n26. \nTo  ensure  long-term  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and  set  standards  in  the  fast-\ngrowing wind industry, the proposed ADB assistance will incorporate loan conditionality, such as \nwind data assessment methodologies, the maintenance of a transparent corporate governance \nstructure,  transparent  and  competitive  procurement  practices,  and  the  maintenance  of  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  consistent  with  ADB  safeguards  policy.  These \ncomponents of the project enhance its demonstration effects, serving as best-practice examples \nto CWP\u2019s peers in the industry. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\nThe project outputs are the installation and operation at designed performance levels of \n27. \nup to 800 MW of wind power generating facilities, in Jilin and/or other locations in the PRC, that \ncomply  with  ADB  safeguards  and  technical  and  financial  eligibility  criteria.  The  project's \nexpected  outcome  is  the  efficient  provision  of  clean  power  through  increased  private  sector \nparticipation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n28. \nThe project directly supports environmentally sustainable development in Jilin, one of the \npoorest  provinces  in  northern  PRC,  by  providing  needed  electricity.  Additional  benefits  will \naccrue  from  the  project\u2019s  benign  environmental  impact,  such  as  air  quality  improvements  and \nclimate  change  mitigation.  In  this  way,  the  project  will  contribute  meaningfully  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s plans to achieve by 2020 (i) 150 GW of wind power capacity installed, (ii) a 15% \nshare of energy supply provided by renewable sources, and (iii) a reduction of carbon intensity \n(greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP) of 40\u201345% from 2005 levels.      \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nThe  project  supports \n\nthe  government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private  sector \n29. \nparticipation  in  wind  power,  which  is  currently  dominated  by  state-owned  conventional  power \ngeneration  companies.  Wind  farms  financed  by  the  project  will  be  some  of  the  few  PRC  wind \nprojects majority owned by the private sector. Specifically for Jilin, the capacity additions by the \nprivate sector will contribute to the province\u2019s 2010\u20132020 economic plan. The inclusion of best-\npractice corporate governance conditions in ADB\u2019s loan will strengthen management standards \nin  wind  power.  In  addition,  the  project\u2019s  B-loan  will  facilitate  international  lending  to  the  PRC \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nwind  subsector,  helping  to  address  the  constraints  private  developers  face  in  securing  private \nsector financing.   \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n30. \nThe  economic  benefits  are  significant  and  include  (i)  the  value  of  electricity  generated, \n(ii) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and (iii) unquantified reductions in other emissions. \nThe expected economic internal rate of return is 19%. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\nimpacts  such  as \n\n31. \nThe  project  is  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  as  its \nanticipated environmental impacts are insignificant or temporary. Typically, wind power projects \nentail small civil works on small parcels of land for the wind turbine towers, maintenance roads, \ntransmission line towers, and a substation. The siting of turbine towers is flexible and can avoid \necologically  sensitive  areas.  Maintenance  access  roads,  transmission  line  towers,  and \nsubstations may require the removal of some vegetation but will be within limited corridors, with \nminimal  ecological  impact  anticipated.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  normally \nrequired  in  the  PRC  for  a  future  subproject  and  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  in \naccordance with the corporate environmental and social management system (ESMS) detailed \nin para. 34 and the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nThe potential noise and visual impacts are considered insignificant given the distance of \n32. \nturbine  towers  from  the  nearest  settlements  in  typical  wind  projects.  During  construction, \nenvironmental \nland  disturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation are temporary and can be \nmanaged  properly  by  the  good  engineering  practices  stipulated  under  each  subproject\u2019s  EIA \nand environmental management plan.  \n \n33. \nThe project is expected to displace 638,000 tons of standard coal utilization per annum \nand annually avoid 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide. The project will help reduce emissions in \ncarbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, smoke and dust, and furnace waste.  \n \n34. \nEnvironmental  and  social  management  system.  In  accordance  with  safeguard \nrequirement  4  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  covering  corporate  finance,  an  audit  of \nCWP\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  was  conducted  with  respect  to  its \nperformance  on  existing  wind  power  projects.  CWP  recently  created  its  Social  Responsibility \nand Environmental Protection Department to manage the environmental and social aspects of \nCWP\u2019s  operations.  Each  plant  covered  by  the  audit  has  its  own  environmental,  health,  and \nsafety  system.  Environmental  and  social  assessment  of  CWP  projects  is  normally  contracted \nout to consultants as part of the processes of feasibility and environmental impact assessment. \nTo  comply  with  ADB's  safeguard  requirements,  CWP  will  adopt  an  ESMS  prior  to  the  first \ndisbursement. CWP will ensure that its wind farm investment vehicles, TXWP and XWP, comply \nwith all safeguard requirements in respect of any wind farm project using ADB funds.    \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n35. \nSocial safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement in accordance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. A typical wind power plant requires small parcels of land \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\nfor  the  wind  towers,  maintenance  roads,  transmission  line  towers,  and  a  substation.  Land \nacquisition  for  two  existing  wind  farms  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  national  and \nprovincial regulations. The compensation rates paid were above the established compensation \nrate for unused land. The siting of wind towers is flexible and can avoid affecting cultivated land \nand  structures.  In  some  cases,  maintenance  access  roads,  transmission  line  towers,  and \nsubstations  may  occupy  or  abut  lands  classified  as  agricultural,  or  affect  crops  and  trees. \nLimited  involuntary  resettlement  is  expected.  Resettlement  plans,  if  required  for  future \nsubprojects, will be prepared and submitted to ADB in accordance with the corporate ESMS and \nsafeguard requirement 2.  \n \n36. \nThe  project  is  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Wind  power  projects  are  generally  located  on  idle  and  barren  land  remote \nfrom local populations. Future subprojects to be funded under this corporate loan are expected \nto  be  sited  in  similar  locations.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  future  subprojects  affect  indigenous \npeoples, the corporate ESMS to be established by CWP will require TXWP and XWP to prepare \nindigenous peoples plans in accordance with safeguard requirement 3. \n \n37. \nGender,  labor,  and  working  conditions.  CWP  upholds  gender  equality  and  provides \nequal  employment  opportunities  for  men  and  women  during  project  design,  construction \nsupervision, and plant operation. In the two plants visited during due diligence, about half of the \nemployees are women. The construction and operation of wind power generating facilities are \nnot  expected  to  have  any  specific  cultural  or  social  impacts  on  any  socioeconomic  group, \nincluding  women,  or  exclude  them  from  benefiting  from  the  project.  Gender  issues  will  be \ncarefully considered during the design of future subprojects.   \n \n38. \nCWP  currently  has  about  1,000  permanent  employees  and  is  expected  to  hire  more \nemployees  as  its  operations  grow.  During  construction  at  a  project  site,  200\u2013300  workers  are \ntypically expected to be engaged, and during the O&M phase 25\u201330 people are employed. It is \nexpected  that  most  of  the  workers  will  be  from  nearby  districts.  CWP  has  human  resource \npolicies  and  procedures  covering  recruitment,  induction,  rewards,  disciplinary  procedures,  and \nlabor contract management. The policies and procedures were formulated in consultation with \nemployees and are communicated to all new employees during induction. CWP will ensure that \ncontractors\u2019 contracts include provisions covering core labor standards. The ESMS will include \nrequirements  to  monitor  the  working  conditions  of  workers  employed  by  contractors  to  ensure \ncompliance with national labor laws and regulations. \n \nStakeholder engagement. The ESMS will include requirements for TXWP and XWP to \n39. \nconduct meaningful consultations during project design, construction, and operation and to have \nongoing  procedures  for  receiving,  documenting,  and  responding  to  community  and  other \nstakeholders\u2019 interests, information requests, and grievances. CWP, through TXWP and XWP, \nwill develop and implement appropriate community development programs and corporate social \nresponsibility  initiatives  in  consultation  with  affected  and  nearby  communities.  These  activities \nwill be monitored by CWP\u2019s Social Responsibility and Environmental Protection Department.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n40. \nProject costs are estimated to be CNY5.8 billion ($853 million equivalent) during 2011\u2013\n2013, including the costs of acquiring turbines, tower tubes, and electrical equipment, as well as \nother installation expenses. ADB\u2019s loan will fund part of the investment plan. The remainder of \nfunding  needs  is  expected  to  be  met  through  (i)  equity  investments  (ii)  debt  financing  from \ncommercial banks, and (iii) internally generated cash flow from CWP\u2019s operations.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Development \n\n41. \nCWP, operating through TXWP and XWP, will control project development and financing \narrangements.  It  will  set  up  subproject  companies  to  construct,  own,  and  operate  the  various \nwind  farms.  This  will  enable  CWP  to  respond  to  local  market  conditions  effectively  and \nefficiently, particularly with regard to issues arising from the quality of construction, management \nand operational policy, budget, financial and accounting procedures, and grid connectivity.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n42. \nCWP, TXWP, and XWP were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  and  Policy  on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire CWP, TXWP, and XWP to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and CWP, TXWP, and \nXWP  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation \n\n43. \nDuring project implementation, ADB will receive reports regularly on project financial and \noperational  indicators,  as  well  as  other  information  to  be  agreed  between  ADB  and  CWP. \nReporting  will  include  (i)  the  financial  statements  of  CWP;  (ii)  calculations  and  compliance \ncertificates  of  the  financial  covenants;  (iii)  the  business  plans  of  CWP,  TXWP,  and  XWP; \n(iv) reports  on  the  progress  and  costs  of  wind farm  construction;  (v)  the  amount  of  power  and \ncertified  emission  reductions  sold;  and  (vi)  O&M  and  other  administrative  costs.  ADB  will \nconduct  annual  reviews  to  monitor  environmental  and  social  safeguard  compliance,  credit \nassessments of projects, and a review of development impacts, among other things. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nLoan \n\n44. \nADB's proposed loan to TXWP and XWP will have two components: (i) a dual currency, \nUS dollar\u2013yuan direct loan (A-loan) in aggregate of up to $120 million equivalent funded by ADB \nand  (ii)  a  B-loan  of  up  to  $120  million  funded  by  commercial  banks.  The  A-loan  will  carry  an \ninterest rate and commitment and front-end fees as approved by ADB's Investment Committee.  \n \n45. \nThe B-loan of up to $120 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan and be on terms and conditions agreed by the borrowers and participating banks. B-loan \nsyndication will be undertaken on a best efforts basis.  \n \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nThe  loan  will  be  without  guarantee  from  the  government.  During  the  life  of  the  loan, \n46. \nTXWP, XWP, and CWP will be bound by financial and operational covenants stipulated in the \nloan agreement, including regular financial and operational monitoring reports and requirements \nto meet minimum financial ratios. \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance \n\n47. \nimpacts  and \nis \ndemonstration effects. It will support the government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n \n\nits  development \n\njustified  by \n\nthe  project \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDespite  the  considerable  investment  in  wind  power  in  the  PRC  during  2007\u2013\n2009,  the  subsector  has  been  dominated  by  major  state-owned  generation \ncompanies.  The  growth  of  private  wind  companies  has  been  constrained  by \ndifficulties in raising financing for projects, particularly in provinces such as Jilin \nwhere  private  sector  development  has  lagged.  The  project  features  a  strong \nmodel  for  addressing  disproportionately  high  transaction  costs  of  medium-  and \nsmall-sized wind power project finance. As a multi-project financing structure, the \nproject  will  enable  ADB  to  extend  its  reach  to  multiple  smaller  wind  power \nsubprojects  that  are  difficult  to  assist  directly.  ADB  assistance  is  essential  for \nholding  companies\u2019  development  of  multiple  projects,  and  it  will  play  a  catalytic \nrole in mobilizing other commercial financing. \n\nADB\u2019s  conditionalities  such  as  more  transparent  corporate  governance,  open \nprocurement  systems,  and  environmental  management  ensure  the  long-term \nsustainable growth of CWP and set early standards in this growing industry. \n\nThe  presence  of  ADB  reaffirms  CWP\u2019s  long-term  strategic  commitment  to  the \nPRC  wind  subsector  and  encourages  the  government  to  continue  support  for \nsubprojects throughout their life. ADB\u2019s participation in the project is expected to \ninstill  confidence  for  future  private  sector  participation  in  and  financing  of  wind \npower projects in the PRC. \n\n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 10  the \n48. \ngovernment has been requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto TXWP and XWP. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, following \nthe approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1966.
