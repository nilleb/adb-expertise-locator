I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \ncomprising an A-loan of up to $120 million and a B-loan of up to $120 million to Tianjin Xiehe \nWind Power Investment Company Limited (TXWP) and Xiehe Wind Power Limited (XWP) for \nthe  Jilin  Wind  Power  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  In  response  to  the  PRC's  greater  role  in  promoting  low-carbon  and  sustainable \ndevelopment in the international community, clean energy has been a target area in business \ndevelopment in the PRC since 2006. The successful implementation of the first private sector \nwind power project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded by local currency bonds1 \ngenerated  considerable  interest  among  sponsors  of  wind  power  projects  and  financial \ninstitutions, as lack of access to finance has been a bottleneck for wind power development. \nPersistent barriers to the financing of wind power projects include (i) the intermittence of wind \nenergy, as availability depends on nature and cannot always be guaranteed; (ii) the large, front-\nloaded development and capital costs for wind power projects, requiring loans with longer \nmaturity than is available in the commercial market; and (iii) the small scale of most wind \nprojects, making transaction costs for project finance disproportionately high.  \n \n3.  CWP has invested in 22 wind power plants with a total capacity of 1.2 gigawatts (GW) \nand has secured development rights for up to 1.3 GW in Jilin Province. Under project approvals \nfrom the government, CWP is responsible for seeking financing to cover the entire costs of its \nnew projects. Lack of access to flexible financial packages has impeded the company's project \ndevelopment, particularly in Jilin, where private sector wind development has lagged. CWP thus \nrequested ADB to take the lead in arranging the financing package for multiple projects, relying \non ADB\u2019s structuring skill. Through due diligence, ADB determined that the proposed project \nsupports ADB\u2019s strategies regarding environmental sustainability, inclusive growth, financial and \ntechnical feasibility, potential for carbon reduction, and demonstration impact. \n \nB.  Sector Background  \n1.  Wind Power in the PRC \n4.  The PRC is Asia\u2019s largest consumer of energy and ranked second in the world as an \nenergy consumer. By 2015, the PRC\u2019s energy sector will need investments of $50 billion\u2013$70 \nbillion per annum, more than double past rates of investment. Coal has historically been the fuel \nof choice, as abundant reserves exist throughout the country. Three-quarters of electricity and \n69% of primary energy is derived from burning coal. The heavy use of coal can cause severe \nlocal impacts such as resource depletion, environmental deterioration, and pollution-related \nhealth effects. Sulfur dioxide emissions\u201470% of which are from coal burning\u2014cause acid rain \non about one-third of the country's landmass. Greenhouse gas emissions\u201480% of which are \nfrom coal burning\u2014outstrip those of other countries and are seen as a global environmental \nissue.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for the Inner \nMongolia Wind Power Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n ", "2      \n \n \n5.  The PRC has a total exploitable wind energy reserve of 4,350 GW, one of the world\u2019s \nlargest. Of this, 1,000 GW onshore and 200 GW offshore can be commercially developed with \nexisting technologies. Over one-quarter of the PRC\u2019s land area has been classified as \u201cwind \nrich\u201d or \u201crelatively wind rich\u201d by official meteorological surveys. The richest wind resources are in \nthe north and in southeastern coastal areas. Nevertheless, wind power still has an insignificant \nshare in the nation\u2019s overall power mix, accounting for only 3% of generation capacity and a \nmeager 1.5% of total electricity output in 2009. \n \n6.  The government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and acted to \nchange the country's pattern of energy use to better balance economic growth and environmental \nprotection. This commitment is reflected in the Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for \nRenewable Energy in China, promulgated in August 2007, in which one of the most prominent \ntargets is to increase renewable energy\u2019s share of electricity generation to 15% by 2020.2 In \nDecember  2009,  the  government  announced  plans  to  cut  carbon  intensity  (carbon  dioxide \nemissions per unit of economic output), targeting a 40%\u201345% reduction from 2005 levels by 2020. \nGiven the expected long-term growth in PRC energy demand, major cuts in carbon intensity \nrequire a significant expansion of lower-carbon energy technologies such as wind.     \n \n7.  National targets for wind power capacity in the Medium- and Long-term Development \nPlan for Renewable Energy in China were originally 5 GW by 2010 and 30 GW by 2020. The \ngoal for 2010 was achieved 3 years early in 2007 and was thus lifted to 10 GW. As of 2009, the \nChina Electricity Council estimated that total installed wind power capacity has reached 21 GW. \nThe government now aims to install 150 GW of wind power by 2020, meaning that 12 GW of \nwind power needs to be installed per year on average for 10 years between 2011 and 2020.  \n \n2.  Regulatory Framework \n8.  Since the early 2000s, the government has instituted a series of renewable energy \npolicies toward rural development, industrial development, environmental protection, and energy \nsecurity goals. As a whole, these policies (i) clarify the strategic objective of renewable energy \ndevelopment, (ii) remove market barriers, (iii) help to create a social and cultural environment \nconducive  to  renewable  energy  development,  and  (v)  promote  the  commercialization  and \ndevelopment of renewable energy.  \n \n9.  The Renewable Energy Law, 2005 and amended in 2009 stipulates financial incentives \nfor renewable energy projects, reduces risks for project developers by mandating power grid \ninterconnection and full power off-take, and provides guaranteed minimum prices for certain \ntypes  of  renewable  energy.  For  wind  power  projects  approved  by  the  government,  the \nRenewable Energy Law requires that (i) the grid utility be responsible for the timely construction \nof transmission lines to connect the wind farms to the nearest grid; (ii) the grid utility purchase \nall the electricity generated by the wind farms; (iii) the tariff for uploading electricity to the power \ngrid be determined through a nationwide concession bidding process, taking into consideration \npower generation costs, loan repayments, and a reasonable profit; (iv) the gap between the \nwind electricity tariff and the average electricity tariff be shared across the whole power grid \nthrough a levy on each kilowatt-hour of electricity sold to the end users. \n \n                                                 \n2  National Development and Reform Commission. 2007. Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable \nEnergy in China. Beijing.  \n ", "3 \n10.  In July 2009, the government further adopted fixed feed-in tariffs for new onshore wind \npower farms, replacing the previous competitive bidding process, which put private wind power \ndevelopers at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the large state-owned power generation companies. This \ntariff reform significantly enhances transparency and efficiency in tariff determination, removes \nprocedural uncertainties, and fosters the confidence of project sponsors and finance providers. \nAll  feed-in  tariffs  are  set  at  a  uniform  level  by  region,  determined  by  that  region\u2019s  wind \nresources. \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n11.  While PRC wind projects have a wide range of developers, the dominant players are \nlarge state-owned conventional power generation companies. The 10 largest developers, which \ntogether controlled 76% of installed wind capacity in 2009, include Guodian (18.8% of installed \nwind  capacity),  Datang  (12.6%),  Huaneng  (11.9%),  Huadian  (8.9%),  and  China  Power \nInvestment (2.3%). For these companies, the motivation to develop wind projects stems in part \nfrom quota regulations requiring 3% of capacity from renewable sources by 2010 and 8% by \n2020.3 As a result, many wind projects in the PRC have been developed with low margins that \nare cross-subsidized by other assets or with relatively low utilization, as renewable energy \nquotas  are  based  on  installed  capacity,  not  power  generated.  Further  private  sector \nparticipation, which has been insignificant so far, is expected to improve operational efficiency \nand play an important role in achieving the government\u2019s goal of 150 GW of installed wind \npower capacity by 2020. \n \n12.  Financing has been a key constraint on private wind developers\u2019 scaling up operations. \nFor domestic loans, local banks typically prefer to lend to large state-owned firms employing \nconventional power generation technologies, and are averse to lending to emerging private \nsector  alternative  energy  companies.  Private  companies  also  have  difficulty  tapping  the \nenterprise bond market, as bond issuance in the PRC is time-consuming, complicated, and \nsubject to various approvals. Private renewable energy developers are increasingly forced to \ntap  other,  more  expensive  forms  of  financing  such  as  equity  and  trusts.  As  a  further \ncomplication, project companies are typically required to commence the construction of a wind \nproject within a relatively short period after the award of development rights.  \n \n4.  Jilin Province \n13.  Jilin Province offers strong potential as a base for developing wind power. Affected by \nSiberian cold fronts and high atmospheric pressure in Mongolia, the province\u2019s wind resources \nare among the best in the PRC, especially in the western areas of the province bordering Inner \nMongolia.  Jilin  has  implemented  a  low-carbon  development  strategy,  provincial  emissions \nreduction targets, renewable energy utilization targets, and environmental dispatch practices. \nThe province has put in place for 2020 a wind capacity target of 20 GW, an almost tenfold \nincrease from the 2009 installed base of 2.1 GW. Nonetheless, wind investment from the private \nsector  is  lagging;  the  five  largest state-owned  generators  account  for  nearly  70%  of  wind \ninstallations.  Jilin\u2019s  2010\u20132020  economic  plan  notes  the  contribution  that  private  sector \ninvestment can make toward achieving clean energy goals.4 \n \n                                                 \n3  The medium- and long-term renewable energy development plan requires power companies with installed capacity \nabove 5 GW to have non-hydro renewable energy account for at least 3% of capacity by 2010 and 8% by 2020. \n4   Jilin Provincial Government. 2010. Jilin Province 2010\u20132020 Industrial Development Plan. Changchun. \n ", "4      \n \n14.  Jilin is one of the poorest provinces in the northern PRC. Per capita income in Jilin in \n2008  was  CNY23,514,  on  par  with  that  of  neighboring  Heilongjiang  (CNY21,727)  but \nsignificantly below those of Inner Mongolia (CNY32,214) and Liaoning (CNY31,259), and far \nbelow  those  of  the  PRC\u2019s  wealthier  areas  such  as  Beijing  (CNY63,029)  and  Shanghai \n(CNY73,124). Traditionally a center of heavy industry, Jilin remains reliant on large state-owned \nmanufacturing: state-owned firms\u2019 output was more than double that of private firms in 2008, 5 \nand their fixed investment more than 4 times greater.  Foreign investment was $17.5 billion in \n2008, or 0.8% of the PRC total, which was well below the province\u2019s 2.1% share of national \nGDP.6 Remote areas of the province, such as those targeted for wind site development, are \nunderdeveloped in terms of industry, with local communities relying on herding and farming. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n15.  Strategy 2020 emphasizes support for achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth \nthrough environmentally sustainable development and private sector development.7 The project \nis consistent with the strategy, which identifies infrastructure and environment as two of the five \ncore areas in which ADB will employ its financial and institutional resources to maximize results, \nefficiency, and impact. In terms of infrastructure, specifically energy, the project will embody the \nstrategy, which sets forth that ADB will (i) help expand the supply of energy and (ii) support \nclean energy. With respect to the environment, the project is in line with the strategy's focus on \n(i) climate change, (ii) livable cities, and (iii) complementary actions. The strategy also aims to \npromote a larger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure by supporting public\u2013\nprivate partnership. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n16.  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy  is  based  on  four  development  pillars: \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.8 The project reinforces each of these pillars, with particular support \nto pillars (ii), (iii), and (iv), and will be integral to ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts to help improve the use \nof renewable and clean energy in the PRC.  \n \n17.  The PRC has been steadily turning to development that is market oriented and led by \nthe private sector, which has become the driving force of economic growth and job creation. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental improvement, building on ADB\u2019s public sector policy advice to the government on \nprivate sector development. Regarding infrastructure and energy, ADB prioritizes pioneering \nprojects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate governance. As agreed \nwith the government, ADB\u2019s private sector operations focus on viable projects located in less-\ndeveloped regions and explore the possibility of loans funded by ADB\u2019s yuan-denominated \nbonds. As a financially strong project focused mainly on relatively underdeveloped areas of Jilin, \n                                                 \n5   Gross industrial output was CNY406.4 billion for state-owned firms and CNY181 billion for private firms. \n6   National Bureau of Statistics. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nand with an option to be partly funded through a yuan loan, the project is consistent with these \naims.  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n18.    ADB's Energy Policy9 requires energy operations to be aligned with ADB's overall \nstrategy  emphasizing  energy  security,  facilitating  a  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy, \nuniversal access to energy, and achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty. The policy \nrequires ADB to help developing member countries provide reliable, adequate, and affordable \nenergy for inclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. It \nsets out three pillars for policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy;  (ii)  maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all;  and  (iii)  promoting  energy  sector  reform, \ncapacity building, and governance. The proposed project is in line with the policy, as the further \ndevelopment of wind power will enhance access to clean energy. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n19.  The project will support CWP in  building a series of wind farms in Jilin and other \nprovinces in the northern PRC where private sector participation is limited and abundant wind \nresources are underutilized.  \n \n20.  CWP will utilize the ADB assistance to fund, through TXWP and XWP, a series of wind \nfarm projects with total production capacity of up to 800 MW by 2013. The portfolio approach, \nbroad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for multiple wind farm projects that \nare often too small and time-consuming for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-\nalone basis. \n \n1.   The Sponsor  \n21.  CWP, the sponsor, is a private company specializing in wind power operations in the \nPRC. Following the government\u2019s policy to encourage private sector investment in wind power, \nCWP was founded by a team of senior managers with strong experience in wind power in the \nPRC and a good reputation. CWP has grown rapidly to establish itself as a leading private \ncompany in the PRC wind industry. It was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in July 2007 \nand is currently 44.6% owned by public shareholders.  \n \n22.  CWP  is  organized  into  two  main  business  groups:  (i)  wind  project  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  management  and  (ii)  wind  farm  project  investment.  The \nengineering, procurement, and construction management group includes one of the largest \nunits for manufacturing wind power tubes in the PRC, as well as units providing service and \nexpertise in wind project design, including wind resource assessment, feasibility studies, and \nengineering design.  \n \n23.  CWP has invested in 22 wind farms with aggregate capacity of 1.2 GW and has secured \ndevelopment rights for 1.3 GW in Jilin. This substantial pipeline allows CWP to select projects \nbased on favorable grid conditions and other factors, facilitating stable and fast development. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "6      \n \n2.  The Borrowers \n24.  XWP and XWP, wholly owned subsidiaries of CWP, are holding companies for CWP's \nwind  farm  operations.  TXWP  is  registered  as  a  foreign-invested  enterprise  and  has  dual \ncurrency, US dollar\u2013yuan borrowing capacity, while XWP is registered as a PRC enterprise and \ncan borrow only in yuan.  \n \n3.  Project Design \n25.  The project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing medium-sized wind power \nprojects, which involves relatively high transaction costs for financing. ADB and CWP aim to \nfinance a series of wind farm projects on a portfolio basis to reduce financing transaction costs \nand diversify the wind resource risk.  \n \n26.  To ensure long-term environmentally sustainable growth and set standards in the fast-\ngrowing wind industry, the proposed ADB assistance will incorporate loan conditionality, such as \nwind data assessment methodologies, the maintenance of a transparent corporate governance \nstructure,  transparent  and  competitive  procurement  practices,  and  the  maintenance  of  an \nenvironmental and social management system consistent with ADB safeguards policy. These \ncomponents of the project enhance its demonstration effects, serving as best-practice examples \nto CWP\u2019s peers in the industry. \n \n4.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n27.  The project outputs are the installation and operation at designed performance levels of \nup to 800 MW of wind power generating facilities, in Jilin and/or other locations in the PRC, that \ncomply  with  ADB  safeguards  and  technical  and  financial  eligibility  criteria.  The  project's \nexpected outcome is the efficient provision of clean power through increased private sector \nparticipation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n   \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n28.  The project directly supports environmentally sustainable development in Jilin, one of the \npoorest provinces in northern PRC, by providing needed electricity. Additional benefits will \naccrue from the project\u2019s benign environmental impact, such as air quality improvements and \nclimate  change  mitigation.  In  this  way,  the  project  will  contribute  meaningfully  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s plans to achieve by 2020 (i) 150 GW of wind power capacity installed, (ii) a 15% \nshare of energy supply provided by renewable sources, and (iii) a reduction of carbon intensity \n(greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP) of 40\u201345% from 2005 levels.      \n \n2.  Private Sector Development \n29.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation in wind power, which is currently dominated by state-owned conventional power \ngeneration companies. Wind farms financed by the project will be some of the few PRC wind \nprojects majority owned by the private sector. Specifically for Jilin, the capacity additions by the \nprivate sector will contribute to the province\u2019s 2010\u20132020 economic plan. The inclusion of best-\npractice corporate governance conditions in ADB\u2019s loan will strengthen management standards \nin wind power. In addition, the project\u2019s B-loan will facilitate international lending to the PRC \n ", "7 \nwind subsector, helping to address the constraints private developers face in securing private \nsector financing.   \n \n3.  Economic Sustainability \n30.  The economic benefits are significant and include (i) the value of electricity generated, \n(ii) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and (iii) unquantified reductions in other emissions. \nThe expected economic internal rate of return is 19%. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions   \n1.  Environment \n31.  The  project  is  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  as  its \nanticipated environmental impacts are insignificant or temporary. Typically, wind power projects \nentail small civil works on small parcels of land for the wind turbine towers, maintenance roads, \ntransmission line towers, and a substation. The siting of turbine towers is flexible and can avoid \necologically  sensitive  areas.  Maintenance  access  roads,  transmission  line  towers,  and \nsubstations may require the removal of some vegetation but will be within limited corridors, with \nminimal ecological impact anticipated. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is normally \nrequired in the PRC for a future subproject and will be prepared and submitted to ADB in \naccordance with the corporate environmental and social management system (ESMS) detailed \nin para. 34 and the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n32.  The potential noise and visual impacts are considered insignificant given the distance of \nturbine  towers  from  the  nearest  settlements  in  typical  wind  projects.  During  construction, \nenvironmental  impacts  such  as  land  disturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation are temporary and can be \nmanaged properly by the good engineering practices stipulated under each subproject\u2019s EIA \nand environmental management plan.  \n \n33.  The project is expected to displace 638,000 tons of standard coal utilization per annum \nand annually avoid 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide. The project will help reduce emissions in \ncarbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, smoke and dust, and furnace waste.  \n \n34.  Environmental  and  social  management  system.  In  accordance  with  safeguard \nrequirement 4 in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, covering corporate finance, an audit of \nCWP\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  was  conducted  with  respect  to  its \nperformance on existing wind power projects. CWP recently created its Social Responsibility \nand Environmental Protection Department to manage the environmental and social aspects of \nCWP\u2019s operations. Each plant covered by the audit has its own environmental, health, and \nsafety system. Environmental and social assessment of CWP projects is normally contracted \nout to consultants as part of the processes of feasibility and environmental impact assessment. \nTo comply with ADB's safeguard requirements, CWP will adopt an ESMS prior to the first \ndisbursement. CWP will ensure that its wind farm investment vehicles, TXWP and XWP, comply \nwith all safeguard requirements in respect of any wind farm project using ADB funds.    \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n35.  Social safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement in accordance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. A typical wind power plant requires small parcels of land \n ", "8      \n \nfor the wind towers, maintenance roads, transmission line towers, and a substation. Land \nacquisition  for  two  existing  wind  farms  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  national  and \nprovincial regulations. The compensation rates paid were above the established compensation \nrate for unused land. The siting of wind towers is flexible and can avoid affecting cultivated land \nand  structures.  In  some  cases,  maintenance  access  roads,  transmission  line  towers,  and \nsubstations may occupy or abut lands classified as agricultural, or affect crops and trees. \nLimited  involuntary  resettlement  is  expected.  Resettlement  plans,  if  required  for  future \nsubprojects, will be prepared and submitted to ADB in accordance with the corporate ESMS and \nsafeguard requirement 2.  \n \n36.  The project is category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Wind power projects are generally located on idle and barren land remote \nfrom local populations. Future subprojects to be funded under this corporate loan are expected \nto be sited in similar locations. In the unlikely event that future subprojects affect indigenous \npeoples, the corporate ESMS to be established by CWP will require TXWP and XWP to prepare \nindigenous peoples plans in accordance with safeguard requirement 3. \n \n37.  Gender, labor, and working conditions. CWP upholds gender equality and provides \nequal  employment  opportunities  for  men  and  women  during  project  design,  construction \nsupervision, and plant operation. In the two plants visited during due diligence, about half of the \nemployees are women. The construction and operation of wind power generating facilities are \nnot expected to have any specific cultural or social impacts on any socioeconomic group, \nincluding women, or exclude them from benefiting from the project. Gender issues will be \ncarefully considered during the design of future subprojects.   \n \n38.  CWP currently has about 1,000 permanent employees and is expected to hire more \nemployees as its operations grow. During construction at a project site, 200\u2013300 workers are \ntypically expected to be engaged, and during the O&M phase 25\u201330 people are employed. It is \nexpected that most of the workers will be from nearby districts. CWP has human resource \npolicies and procedures covering recruitment, induction, rewards, disciplinary procedures, and \nlabor contract management. The policies and procedures were formulated in consultation with \nemployees and are communicated to all new employees during induction. CWP will ensure that \ncontractors\u2019 contracts include provisions covering core labor standards. The ESMS will include \nrequirements to monitor the working conditions of workers employed by contractors to ensure \ncompliance with national labor laws and regulations. \n \n39.  Stakeholder engagement. The ESMS will include requirements for TXWP and XWP to \nconduct meaningful consultations during project design, construction, and operation and to have \nongoing  procedures  for  receiving,  documenting,  and  responding  to  community  and  other \nstakeholders\u2019 interests, information requests, and grievances. CWP, through TXWP and XWP, \nwill develop and implement appropriate community development programs and corporate social \nresponsibility initiatives in consultation with affected and nearby communities. These activities \nwill be monitored by CWP\u2019s Social Responsibility and Environmental Protection Department.  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n40.  Project costs are estimated to be CNY5.8 billion ($853 million equivalent) during 2011\u2013\n2013, including the costs of acquiring turbines, tower tubes, and electrical equipment, as well as \nother installation expenses. ADB\u2019s loan will fund part of the investment plan. The remainder of \nfunding needs is expected to be met through (i) equity investments (ii) debt financing from \ncommercial banks, and (iii) internally generated cash flow from CWP\u2019s operations.  \n ", "9 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Development \n41.  CWP, operating through TXWP and XWP, will control project development and financing \narrangements. It will set up subproject companies to construct, own, and operate the various \nwind  farms.  This  will  enable  CWP  to  respond  to  local  market  conditions  effectively  and \nefficiently, particularly with regard to issues arising from the quality of construction, management \nand operational policy, budget, financial and accounting procedures, and grid connectivity.  \n \n2.  Anticorruption Policy  \n42.  CWP, TXWP, and XWP were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire CWP, TXWP, and XWP to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and CWP, TXWP, and \nXWP  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings. \n \n3.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation \n43.  During project implementation, ADB will receive reports regularly on project financial and \noperational indicators, as well as other information to be agreed between ADB and CWP. \nReporting will include (i) the financial statements of CWP; (ii) calculations and compliance \ncertificates of  the  financial covenants;  (iii)  the  business plans  of  CWP,  TXWP,  and  XWP; \n(iv) reports on the progress and costs of wind farm construction; (v) the amount of power and \ncertified  emission  reductions  sold;  and  (vi)  O&M  and  other  administrative  costs.  ADB  will \nconduct  annual  reviews  to  monitor  environmental  and  social  safeguard  compliance,  credit \nassessments of projects, and a review of development impacts, among other things. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Loan \n44.  ADB's proposed loan to TXWP and XWP will have two components: (i) a dual currency, \nUS dollar\u2013yuan direct loan (A-loan) in aggregate of up to $120 million equivalent funded by ADB \nand (ii) a B-loan of up to $120 million funded by commercial banks. The A-loan will carry an \ninterest rate and commitment and front-end fees as approved by ADB's Investment Committee.  \n \n45.  The B-loan of up to $120 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan and be on terms and conditions agreed by the borrowers and participating banks. B-loan \nsyndication will be undertaken on a best efforts basis.  \n \n ", "10     \n \n46.  The loan will be without guarantee from the government. During the life of the loan, \nTXWP, XWP, and CWP will be bound by financial and operational covenants stipulated in the \nloan agreement, including regular financial and operational monitoring reports and requirements \nto meet minimum financial ratios. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n47.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  project  is  justified  by  its  development  impacts  and \ndemonstration effects. It will support the government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n \n(i)  Despite the considerable investment in wind power in the PRC during 2007\u2013\n2009,  the  subsector  has  been  dominated  by  major  state-owned  generation \ncompanies. The growth of private wind companies has been constrained by \ndifficulties in raising financing for projects, particularly in provinces such as Jilin \nwhere private sector development has lagged. The project features a strong \nmodel for addressing disproportionately high transaction costs of medium- and \nsmall-sized wind power project finance. As a multi-project financing structure, the \nproject  will  enable  ADB  to  extend  its  reach  to  multiple  smaller  wind  power \nsubprojects that are difficult to assist directly. ADB assistance is essential for \nholding companies\u2019 development of multiple projects, and it will play a catalytic \nrole in mobilizing other commercial financing. \n \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s conditionalities such as more transparent corporate governance, open \nprocurement  systems,  and  environmental  management  ensure  the  long-term \nsustainable growth of CWP and set early standards in this growing industry. \n \n(iii)  The presence of ADB reaffirms CWP\u2019s long-term strategic commitment to the \nPRC wind subsector and encourages the government to continue support for \nsubprojects throughout their life. ADB\u2019s participation in the project is expected to \ninstill confidence for future private sector participation in and financing of wind \npower projects in the PRC. \n \nC.  Assurances \n48.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 10  the \ngovernment has been requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto TXWP and XWP. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, following \nthe approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1966.
