If the Board approves the proposed loans, grant, and administration of loan and \nTA, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB providing the \nbalance of the TA.  \n\nThe  sector  development  program1 comprises  (i)  a  program  to  address  national  water \n2. \nresources  management  and  irrigation  policy  issues  in  Cambodia;  (ii)  a  project  to  assist  the \nMinistry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  to  rehabilitate  small-  to  medium-\nscale  irrigation  systems  and  deliver  irrigation  services  within  the  Tonle  Sap  basin;  and  \n(iii)  supporting  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (CDTA).  The  sector  development \nprogram is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Cambodia, 2009\u20132012.2,3   \n\n3. \nThe design of the sector development program and the focus of the proposed activities \nin the Tonle Sap basin are based on TA feasibility studies from 2007 to 2009.4  They also take \naccount  of  lessons  learned  from  the  ongoing  and  recently  completed  ADB-  and  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)-financed  Northwest  Irrigation  Sector 5 and  Stung  Chinit \nIrrigation  Projects,6 investments  under  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative,7 and  ADB\u2019s  country  and  sector \nassistance  program  evaluations.8 Extensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  during \nthe  program  design  process  in  2009\u20132010  and  through  the  Government\u2019s  Technical  Working \nGroup  on  Agriculture  and  Water.  Recognizing  the  ongoing  dialogue  with  the  government  on \nwater  sector  policy  issues  addressed  under  the  sector  development  program,  the  program \nperiod is considered to have begun in May 2008 (footnote 4). \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale. Cambodia\u2019s economy is highly dependent on water. Its importance for food \n4. \nproduction,  rural  livelihoods  and  economic  development  is  recognized  in  the  Government\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n3   The sector development program contributes to ADB Strategy 2020 core operations through the provision of rural \ninfrastructure,  promotion  of  environmentally  sustainable  growth  (improved  water  management  and  adaptation  to \nclimate change) and education, as well as supporting non-core operations in agriculture. \n\n4   ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  to  Prepare  the  Water  Resources  Management \n(Sector)  Project.  Manila  (TA  4848-CAM,  approved  for  $1.3  million  on  16  October  2006).  The  Water  Resources \nManagement Sector Development Program was initially proposed as a sector project and loan fact finding was first \nconducted  in  December  2007.  Additional  TA  studies  were  initiated  on  institutional  capacity  and  to  strengthen \ninvestment project aspects in May 2008. Because of concerns about ongoing projects and recognition of the need \nto  address  sector-wide  policy  issues,  processing  was  deferred  to  2010  and  a  sector  development  program \napproach was adopted. A major change in TA scope was prepared in 2009 to refocus the TA. Preparation of the \nsector development program began in March 2009. \n\n5   ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nRectangular  Strategy  on  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency  (Phase  2,  2008),  the \nNational Strategic Development Plan (NSDP, 2006\u20132013), and the Strategy for Agriculture and \nWater  Resources  (SAW,  2009\u20132013).  Rainfall  distribution  and  river  discharges  are  highly \nseasonal, variable and unpredictable, with a natural pattern of wet and dry seasons, typhoons, \nfloods and droughts. Coupled with this, the annual rise and fall of the Mekong River9 has both \npositive  and  negative  effects\u2014sustaining  the  critical  water  cycles  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake  and \nLower Mekong delta necessary for agriculture and fisheries production, but with the potential to \ncause major flooding and damage to infrastructure and crops, and loss of life. It is anticipated \nthat  climate  change  will  increase  the  challenges  of  water  management;  less  rainfall  is \nanticipated during the dry season and more during the wet season, with more frequent extreme \nweather events and potentially worse seasonal water shortages and floods.  \n\n5. \nThe  sector  development  program  supports  the  process  of  (i)  strengthening  national \nwater sector policy, regulatory and the institutional environment; (ii) improving integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) performance in river basins, focusing on the Tonle Sap basin \nand the Strung Sen sub-basin; and (iii) strengthening irrigation services in a selected area of the \nTonle Sap basin. These are the three main thrusts of ADB\u2019s Water for All policy.  \n\n6. \nThe  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management,  2007  (the  Water  Law)  is  the  basis  of  the \nenabling  environment,  which  aims  to  manage  water  resources  using  an  IWRM  approach.10 \nMOWRAM,  headed  by  the  minister  for  water  resources,  has  the  lead  responsibility  for  water \nresources  management.  The  minister  also  chairs  the  Cambodia  National  Mekong  Committee \nwhich  represents  Cambodia  on  the  Mekong  River  Commission  and  the  Tonle  Sap  Authority \nwhich  was  recently  established  to  coordinate  development  activities  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin. \nOther  ministries  and  agencies  involved  in  water  resource  use  and  management  include  the \nMinistries  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF),  Environment  (MOE),  Health  (MOH); \nIndustry  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME),  Rural  Development  (MRD),  and  Public  Works  and \nTransport  (MPWT)  and  the  National  Committee  for  Disaster  Management  (NCDM).  Instituting \nan effective IWRM regime requires that these agencies and relevant stakeholders work together \nand  in  a  coordinated  manner,  on  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  policy,  strategies  and \npriorities. \n\nAlthough provided for under the Water Law, there is currently no regular mechanism for \n7. \nto  address  critical  water  resource  development  and \nintersectoral  coordination \nbroad \nmanagement  such  as:  (i)  the  balance  between  fisheries,  irrigated  agriculture,  hydro-electric \npower generation, urban, industrial and rural water supply, and tourism; (ii) the development on \ntributary  rivers  and  the  balance  of  upstream  and  downstream  benefits;  (iii)  the  operation  of \ndams,  and  the  storage  and  diversion  of  water;  and  (iv)  the  management  of  water  quality  and \nmaintenance of ecosystems.   \n\n8. \nThe  government  plans  to  review  and  strengthen  inter-ministerial  arrangements  for \nnational water resources management either by elevating existing coordination structures or by \nestablishing  a  new,  high-level  inter-ministerial mechanism  to  determine  national  policy  relating \nto water.11 At the river basin level, the government will pilot activities in the Stung Sen sub-basin \nto  develop  coordination  mechanisms  for  river  basin  management  that  can  then  be  applied \n                                                 \n9   About 86% of Cambodia lies within the Mekong basin, about 20% of which is in Cambodia.  \n10 IWRM  is  described  by  the  Global  Water  Partnership  Technical  Advisory  Committee  (2006)  as  \u201ca  process  that \npromotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximize \nthe resultant economic and social  welfare in an equitable manner  without compromising the sustainability of vital \necosystems.\u201d See feasibility studies conducted under the TA cited in footnote 4 for a discussion of IWRM issues in \nCambodia.  \n\n11  This  will  be  supported  through  the  establishment  of  working  groups,  comprising  government  staff  from  key \nagencies,  sector  stakeholders  from  the  private  sector  and  academic  institutions,  supported  under  the  CDTA,  to \nadvise the government on appropriate coordination mechanisms. This process will be used for all policy activities.  \n\n\fnationwide,  building  on  existing  provincial  rural  development  council  structures.  A  committee \nrepresenting provinces, sectors, and stakeholders (including water users and civil society) at the \nriver  basin  level  will  be  established.  National  and  local  level  organizational  development  and \ncapacity building is needed for sound water resource planning, mainstreaming IWRM; improving \ndata management and flood and drought forecasting; and strengthening coordination for climate \nchange adaptation. \n\n9. \nPrevious ADB projects have assisted the government to develop the Water Law, but the \nnecessary sub-decrees and implementing regulations have not yet been finalized or approved. \nSub-decrees  for  water  allocation  and  licensing,  river  basin  management,  establishment  of \nfarmer  water  user  communities  (FWUCs),  and  water  quality  are  prioritized  under  the  SAW.  In \nparticular,  legislation  is  needed  for  FWUCs  to  (i)  ensure  farmers  have  sufficient  autonomy  to \nundertake  activities  corporately,  and  (ii)  assign  responsibility  and  rights  for  the  infrastructure \nfrom the government to the FWUCs to enhance local ownership and responsibility for operation \nand maintenance (O&M). Institutional capacity is also needed to implement the regulations.  \n\n10. \nMOWRAM is responsible for providing irrigation services, including the development of \nall irrigation infrastructure (large, medium and small), O&M, and support for farmers to manage \nirrigation  schemes.12 MOWRAM  has  the  capacity  to  oversee  and  manage  investment  projects \nwith  external  assistance,  but  needs  capacity  strengthening  and  resources  at  national  and \nprovincial levels to improve irrigation operations. A clearer demarcation is needed of the roles \nand responsibilities of MOWRAM, the provincial departments of water resources management \nand  meteorology  (PDWRAMs),  and  FWUCs,  as  well  as  their  links  with  MAFF\u2019s  provincial \ndepartments  of  agriculture.13 Engineering  and  project  management  human  resource  capacity \nand  competences  for  irrigation  and  drainage  O&M  need  to  be  upgraded  and  strengthened. \nImprovements  in  administration,  financial  and  business  processes  are  needed  in  line  with  the \ngovernment's  public  financial  management  reform  program. 14 To  support  long-term  O&M,  a \nnational asset management system is being developed to identify O&M costs, benchmarks and \nbudgets. \n\n11. \nThe  sustainability  of  irrigation  services  is  highly  dependent  on  the  capabilities  and \nresponsibilities  of  farmers.  A  national  program  to  strengthen  their  ability  to  manage  minor \nirrigation  schemes  through  FWUCs  has  been  in  progress  since  1999.  Additional  investments \nare needed (i) to expand FWUCs and training of farmers, including on-farm water management \nand O&M of irrigation systems and (ii) for putting in place legal mechanisms to enable farmers, \nthrough elected FWUCs, to cover the costs of O&M independently, with appropriate incentives. \nVocational  and  on-the-job  training  needs  to  be  extended  to  FWUCs,  with  matching  grants  for \nFWUCs so they can access funds for works and capacity building. \n\n12. \nCambodia  needs  more  engineers,  agronomists,  economists,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  specialists  to  promote  IWRM  and  irrigation  services.  In  particular,  MOWRAM \nneeds to recruit and retain more qualified engineers. The Institut de Technologie du Cambodge \n(ITC)  has  a  Rural  Engineering  Department,  and  MOWRAM  has  its  own  technical  services \ncentre.  Tertiary  training  in  water  resource  management,  irrigation  engineering,  on-farm  water \nmanagement  and  hydrology  needs  to  be  strengthened  and expanded;  and  vocational  and  on-\nthe-job training in irrigation O&M needs to be extended for MOWRAM staff and farmers.  \n\n                                                 \n12  MOWRAM\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  (2009)  identifies  2,403  irrigation  schemes  with  a  total  wet  season \n\nirrigated area of 773,188 ha, and total dry season area of 347,058 ha; for a total area of 1,120,246 ha.  \n\n13 Reflecting ADB\u2019s Water Policy, the program has been designed to assist MOWRAM to distinguish between its role \n\nof \u201cservice provider\u201d and that of \u201cregulator\u201d, and develop appropriate institutional mechanisms and capacities. \n\n14  Also  supported  under:  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Public  Financial  Management  for  Rural  Development \nProgram. Manila (Grants 0132/1033-CAM). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n13. \nTo  support  Cambodia  to  meet  its  food  security,  poverty  reduction,  and  economic \ndevelopment targets under the NSDP, and to strengthen the delivery of irrigation services, the \ngovernment  plans  to  rehabilitate  about  15,000  ha  of  small-  and  medium-scale  irrigation \nschemes  in  three  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin,  building  on  Northwest  Irrigation  Sector \nProject investments. \n\n14. \nImpact and outcome. The impact of the proposed sector development program will be \nenhanced  food  security.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  management  of  water  resources  and \nmore efficient and sustainable irrigation services in the project area.  \n\n15. \nOutputs.  The  sector  development  program  has  three  key  outputs  with  the  objective  of \nimproving  the  management  of  water  resources  in  Cambodia  by  enhancing  the  capacity  of  (a) \nthe government to manage water resources; and (b) MOWRAM to manage and deliver irrigation \nservices,  as  detailed  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  and  project \nadministration  manual  (PAM).15 Outputs  A  and  B  are  outputs  related  to  the  program,  whereas \noutput C is related to the project. \n\nOutput  A:  Enhanced  capacity  for  sustainable  water  resources  management.  The \n16. \nsector  development  program  will  strengthen  (i)  the  enabling  policy,  regulatory  and  institutional \nenvironment  to  coordinate  and  collaborate  on  water  resources  management;  (ii)  strengthen \nMOWRAM's  capacity  to  promote  IWRM  in  river  basins;  and  (iii)  ensure  adequate  human \nresources are available for carrying this out.  \n\n17. \nOutput  B:  Enhanced  capacity  of  MOWRAM  to  manage  and  deliver  irrigation \nservices.  The  sector  development  program  will  support  MOWRAM  to  implement  activities \nidentified under the SAW and to improve its organization and financial management at national, \nprovincial  and  local  levels  by  (i)  supporting  implementation  of  the  SAW;  (ii)  strengthening  the \norganization,  administration  and  technical  capacity  of  MOWRAM,  PDWRAMs,  and  district \noffices;  (iii)  providing  adequate  budgets  for  O&M;  and  (iv)  developing  the  capacity  of \ngovernment staff and farmers to carry out sustainable O&M. \n\nits  national  development  goals  under \n\n18. \nOutput  C:  Sustainable  rehabilitation  of  small-  and  medium-scale  irrigation \nschemes in the Tonle Sap basin.

The taxes and duties to be financed by ADB \nrepresent a small share of the project investment plan (3.4%) and apply only to ADB-financed expenditures. The \nfinancing of the taxes and duties is considered material and relevant to the success of the project to ensure timely \nprocurement of goods and services. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nwill have a 20-year maturity, including a 5-year grace period, a 1.5% interest charge and a 1% \nservice  charge  per  annum.  The  government  will  contribute  $6.36  million  equivalent,  including \nboth in-kind expenditure (as well as priority operating costs)20 and a portion of taxes and duties. \nContributions from beneficiaries will take the form of payment of fees for irrigation services. \n\nImplementation  Arrangements:  MOWRAM  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the \n22. \nprogram  and  project.  A  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  for  overall \nprogram  coordination,  and  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  of  MOWRAM,  with  the  secretary  of \nstate of MOWRAM as permanent vice chair. The PSC will include high level representatives of \nMAFF, Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), MOE, MRD, MOH, MPWT, MIME, Ministry of \nLand  Management,  Urban  Planning  and  Construction,  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of \nWomen\u2019s\u2019 Affairs, and the NCDM.21 A program management office (PMO) will be established in \nMOWRAM  to  manage  the  program  and  ensure  policy  actions  are  implemented.  It  will  be \nsupported by (i) a water resources program support unit in the Department of Water Resources \nManagement of MOWRAM to coordinate activities under output A, and (ii) an irrigation services \nprogram  support  unit  in  the  Department  of  Irrigated  Agriculture  of  MOWRAM  to  coordinate \nactivities  under  output  B.  The  detailed  implementation  arrangements  for  the  program  are \ndescribed  in  the  PAM.  The  implementation  period  for  the  program  is  May  2008  to  December \n2012, and the loan closing date is June 2013 (para. 3). \n\n23. \nImplementation arrangements for the project are summarized in Table 3 and described \nin  detail  in  the  PAM.  These  arrangements  are  fully  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \noperating procedures.22  \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n24. \nGrant-financed  CDTA,  Supporting  Policy  and  Institutional  Reforms  and  Capacity \nDevelopment in the Water Sector, will support the implementation of the program (as reflected \nunder  outputs  A  and  B).  The  expected  outcome  of  the  CDTA  is  better  management  of  water \nresources and irrigation services through enhanced planning, policy, legislation, organizational \ndevelopment and enhanced human resources capacity. The CDTA will provide direct assistance \nto  ITC  to  support  undergraduate  and  post-graduate  degrees  in  water  resources  and  irrigation \nmanagement and technical assistance to MOWRAM to support the expansion of vocational and \non-the-job  training  for  staff  and  farmers  through  its  technical  services  centre.  The  CDTA  will \nsupport  the  PMO  to  implement  the  agreed  actions  under  the  policy  matrix  and  to  monitor  the \nprogress of policy reforms.  \n\nThe cost of the CDTA is estimated at $11.16 million equivalent over a 5-year period. The \n25. \nCDTA will be cofinanced on a grant basis by: ADB\u2019s TA funding program for $1.0 million (from \nTASF-IV);  the  Government  of  Australia  (AusAID),  will  provide  support  of  A$5  million  ($4.55 \nmillion  equivalent);23 and  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF),  will  provide  support  of  \u20ac3.0 \nmillion ($3.75 million equivalent). The CDTA will be jointly cofinanced, and ADB will administer \nit. The balance of the local currency cost, amounting to $1.86 million equivalent, will be met by \nthe government to cover office accommodation, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars \nand meetings, and other administrative expenses. The executing agency for the CDTA will be \nMOWRAM, and its activities will be monitored by the PSC (for which purpose ITC will be invited \nto join the PSC). ADB will select and engage an international firm in association with a national \n\n                                                 \n20 Priority operating costs are government incentives paid to staff to achieve agreed outputs of development activities. \n21 ADB, AusAID, NDF and OFID will be invited as observers to the PSC meetings. \n22 Ministry of Economy and Finance. 2005.

The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  program  will  include  \n26. \n(i)  improved  management  of  water  resources  to  increase  water  and  food  security,  enhance \nlivelihoods  and  ecosystem  services,  reduced  incidence  of  floods  and  droughts,  and  greater \nresilience  to  climate  change;  and  (ii)  improved  productivity  of  irrigated  agricultural  production \nand cost savings arising from increased system efficiency.  \n\n27. \nThe project adopts a sector approach, under which the entire scope of project activities \nis not firmly identified at the project preparation stage. The core subprojects were analyzed as \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\frepresentative  of  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  and  financial  sustainability. 24  These  core \nsubprojects  covered  an  irrigated  area  of  6,634  ha  (about  24%  of  the  area  covered  by  the \nsubprojects).  From  a  financial  perspective,  the  project  will  help  project  beneficiaries  to  raise \nfarm  productivity  by  increasing  the  timeliness  and  reliability  of  irrigation,  improving  on-farm \nmanagement  of  water  and  soils,  and  introducing  better  irrigated  agriculture  practices.  The \noutcomes will be greater household incomes and more food for household consumption. For the \ncore subprojects, the average additional value added per farm was found to range from $205 to \n$423  per  annum.  Based  on  the  incremental  increase  in  this  household  income,  investment  in \nthese subprojects was found to yield a financial internal rate of return of 7.4%\u201314.4%.25 \n\n28. \nFrom  an  economic  perspective,  the  project  will  yield  tangible  and  intangible  economic \nbenefits to the national economy. The major tangible benefits will be an incremental increase in \nfarm production and productivity, contributing to sustained growth of the agricultural sector. The \nintangible benefits will be improved health of project beneficiaries as a result of the better food \nsupply,  improved  productivity  of  project  beneficiaries,  increased  water  availability  for  domestic \nconsumption,  and  more  efficient  use  of  soil  and  water.  For  the  core  subprojects,  the  project \ninvestment was found to yield an economic internal rate of return of 13.9%\u201324.3%.26   \n\n29. \nGovernance. The sector development program is designed to assist the government to \naddress priority policy, legislative, and institutional reforms in the water sector. ADB will monitor \nthe  sector  development  program  during  its  implementation  through  regular  program  reporting \nand its review missions. Project implementation, procurement and financial management will be \naligned with the government's standard operating procedures (Table 3, footnote a). The sector \ndevelopment  program's  alignment  with  the  government's  public  financial  management  reform \nprocess  and  its  decentralization  and  deconcentration  initiatives  will  improve  governance  and \nreduce  corruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to \nand  discussed  with  the  MEF  and  MOWRAM  for  both  the  program  and  project  elements.  The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  of  the  project  are  described  in  the \nPAM. A good governance framework has been prepared.27    \n\n30. \nPoverty  and  social  impacts.  The  policy  reforms  and  project  investment  activities \nincluded in the sector development program are expected to reduce the poverty of the program \nbeneficiaries  directly  through  increased  food  security  and  rural  job  creation.  The  program  will \npromote  gender  mainstreaming.  Better  water  sector  management  will  improve  water  use  and \nmanagement  by  MOWRAM,  PDWRAMs  and  water  users.  The  current  poor  agricultural \nproductivity  and  consequent  food  shortages  and  out-migration  are  expected  to  decrease  with \nbetter  management  of  local  water  resources.  The  establishment  and  support  of  FWUCs  will \nprovide  opportunities  for  beneficiaries  to  manage  their  local  water  resources  and  assume \nresponsibility  for  maintaining  the  structures.  Beneficiaries,  especially  women  and  households \nheaded  by  women,  will  be  empowered  when  they  secure  land  entitlements  and  gain  greater \nsecurity  over  natural  resource  management  as  a  basis  for  future  investments.  MOWRAM\u2019s \ngreater  capacity  for  IWRM,  irrigation  O&M,  climate  change  adaptation,  flood  and  drought \nforecasting,  and  dissemination  of  information  to  communities  will  help  farmers  to  plan  for  and \nrespond to natural disasters, buffering the shock and limiting crop losses.28    \n\n                                                 \n24 The three core subprojects and 24 potential subprojects, with a total area of 27,489 ha, were identified for possible \ninclusion  based  on  MOWRAM  and  PDWRAM  priorities  in  each  province.  Subproject  profiles  were  prepared  for \neach scheme under the PPTA, and selection criteria for further screening are in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \n\n25  ADB. 2008 (updated in 2010).

A  gender  action  plan29 will  support  MOWRAM's  strategy  of  promoting  greater \n31. \ninvolvement of women and encouraging equality of opportunity in all aspects of water resources \nmanagement, irrigation services, rehabilitation of irrigation systems, and agricultural production. \nADB classifies the sector development program as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d \n\nSocial  safeguards:  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (categories  B  and  C, \n32. \nrespectively).  Limited  involuntary  resettlement  is  foreseen  under  the  sector  development \nprogram. For the project loan, subproject selection criteria limit the inclusion of any activities that \nwould  cause  significant  involuntary  resettlement.  Rehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems  will  not \ncause  significant  resettlement  impacts  because  the  works  will  be  along  existing  rights  of  way \nand  will  mainly  require,  if  any,  the  acquisition  of  minor  amounts  of  land,  relocation  of  persons \nliving in areas to be flooded or inundated (within existing or former reservoir areas), and minor \ncompensation  for  trees,  crops  or  possibly  small  buildings.  The  government  has  prepared  and \nendorsed a resettlement framework.30  Resettlement costs will be financed by the government. \n\n33. \nEthnic  minorities,  mainly  Kouy,  live  and  derive  their  livelihoods  in  upland  areas  of  the \nwatersheds. Field studies indicate that they are not likely to be affected or directly benefit from \nthe rehabilitation of irrigation schemes, since they live outside the proposed subproject areas.  \n\n34. \nSocial  safeguards:  environment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  was \nconducted  for  the  policy  and  project  interventions.  It  indicates  that  the  proposed  policy \ninterventions focusing on improved water resource management and institutional strengthening \nare likely to have major positive impacts and significantly contribute to water conservation and \nenvironmental  protection.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  conducted  for  a  sample \nsubproject  to  identify  potential  impacts,  appropriate  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nmechanisms. It confirmed that the proposed investment component of the sector development \nprogram is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts. Subprojects will follow \nenvironmental assessment procedures stipulated in the environmental assessment and review \nframework.31  \n\n35. \nRisks and mitigating measures.

Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \nAsian  Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n\nYour Excellency, \n\nPhnom  Penh, 29 June 2010 \n\nSubject: Development Policy Letter - Water Resources Management Sector Development Program \n\n1. \nOn  behalf of the  Royal  Government of Cambodia  (RGC),  I am  writing to  request a loan \nfrom  the  Special  Fund  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Water  Resources \nManagement Sector  Development  Program  (WRMSDP).  The  WRMSDP  has  been  formulated \nthrough  extensive  discussions  between  ADB  and the  RGC,  and  key stakeholders  in  the  water \nresources  sector.  We  recognize  that  our  national  economic  growth  and  development  is \nincreasing  the  complexity  of  managing  the  competing  demands  for  water,  and  we  need  to \nensure that the management of water resources is more effective.  In  addition, climate change is \nlikely to  increase  the  frequency  and  intensity of floods  and  droughts,  and  with  it  the  need  for \nimproved water resources management, to which RGC  is firmly committed. \n\nThis  letter  is  intended  to  briefly  describe  the  strategy  of  the  RGC  for  social  and \n2. \neconomic  development,  and  recent  progress  in  poverty  reduction  and  growth.  It  notes  the \nimportance of the agriculture sector in  reducing  poverty and improving food security, about 60% \nof  the  population  depending  directly  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood,  and  the  critical \nimportance of sustainable management of water resources. \n\nin  2008,  provides \n\nThe  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth.  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency.  Phase  2 \n3. \nfor  the  country's  socio-economic \nframework \n(RS2),  approved \ndevelopment.  It is founded on  the platforms of good  governance,  peace,  political stability, social \norder,  macroeconomic  stability,  partnership  and  economic  integration.  The  four  strategic \n\"growth  rectangles\"  are:  enhancement of the  agricultural  sector,  rehabilitation  and  construction \nof physical infrastructure, private sector development and  employment generation, and capacity \ndevelopment and human resource development. \n\nthe \n\n4. \nThe  updated  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2009-2013,  which  was \napproved  by the  National Assembly on  31  May 2010,  will  serve to  ope rationalize  RS2  with  the \noverall  aim  of poverty  reduction,  and  act as  the  guiding  document for implementation  of RS2. \nThe  NSDP  draws  on  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  the  National  Population  Policy \nand  other sector policies  and  strategies  aimed  to  ensure  Cambodia's  rapid  progress  towards \nachieving  the  Cambodia  Millennium  Development Goals  and  other socio-economic goals.  The \nNSDP directs 62.4% of resources to rural areas, with increased attention to production activities \nincluding  agriculture  and  rural  development,  and  to  health  and  education  for  human  capital \ndevelopment. \n\n5. \nBetween  2004  and  2008,  Cambodia's  economic  growth  rate  averaged  an  impressive \n10% per year,  owing to the  maintenance of macroeconomic stability and  sustained  high growth \nof the garments, tourism,  and construction sectors.  The agricultural sector also contributed,  but \nwith  a high  degree  of volatility,  mostly reflecting  uneven  climactic  conditions.  This  high  rate  of \ngrowth  has  resulted  in  a decline in the  incidence of poverty, from  35%  in  2004 to 30%  in  2007 . \n\ntlrmm el!lNirliifeu~ 2llill:l9tc1m  n~'iil9i\\tc1m 'figill \nSt.92, Sangkat Wat Phnom.

More specifically, garment exports contracted from  much \nlower  external  demand  from  the  main  U.S.  market;  construction  slowed  sharply  from  much \nlower construction-related FDI  inflows, including from the Republic of Korea which was invested \nheavily  in  the  sector;  and  tourism  activity  was  very  subdued.  Agricultural  output  however,  is \nestimated  to  have  expanded  by  5.4%  and  acted  as  the  traditional  safety  net for  retrenched \ngarment, tourism, and  construction workers. \n\n6. \nTo  help mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis on  growth and  on  the  most vulnerable, \nthe  RGC  took  a  series  of  measures,  including  an  accommodating  monetary  policy,  an \nexpansionary fiscal  policy, and an acceleration of some key structural reforms.  In  particular, the \nminimum reserve  requirement imposed  on  commercial banks was  reduced  to  12%  in  February \n2009, and the Government provided some temporary taxation relief to the tourism and garment \nindustries;  increased  spending  on  rural  infrastructure,  including  on  irrigation;  eliminated  tariffs \non  fertilizers  and  imports  of agricultural  machinery;  provided  $18 million  (0.2%  of GDP) to  rice \nmillers to help them expand capacity and  purchase rice for processing and export; and  provided \n$10  million  in  funds  for  retraining  laid-off  garment  workers.  The  RGC  also  took  measures  to \nfacilitate transport and trade with neighboring countries. \n\nRecognizing  the  importance  of  agriculture  and  water  resources,  a  Government\u00ad\n\n7. \nDevelopment  Partner  Technical  Working  Group  for  Agriculture  and  Water  (TWGAW)  was \nestablished  in  2006  to  develop  a  Strategy  on  Agriculture  and  Water  (SAW),  which  was \napproved  by the RGC in  March 2007.  The TWGAW  identified and  prioritized  activities,  policies \nand institutional reforms through a consultative process with a wide range of stakeholders. The \nStrategy represents  a shared agenda of actions to improve effectiveness;  it includes improved \nmanagement of water resources following an  integrated water resources  management (IWRM) \napproach.  Most development  partner-supported  activities  in  the  sector have  addressed  policy \nand  institutional  reforms  for  agriculture  related  activities,  to  which  the  RGC  remains  firmly \ncommitted. \nI  am  now  asking  ADB  to  support  improvements  in  critical  water  resources \nmanagement through the WRMSDP. \n\n8. \nThe WRMSDP will  support the RGC in addressing two areas we recognize as critical:  (i) \nenhancing  our capacity to manage water  resources,  and  (ii)  enhancing  our capacity to  deliver \nirrigation services. \n\n9. \nThe  basis  for  water  management  in  Cambodia  is  the  Law  on  Water  Resources \nManagement of 2007,  which  states  (Article  4) that water resources  will  be  managed  using  an \nintegrated  water  resource  management  approach  (lWRM).  The  Law  appoints  the  Ministry  of \nWater  Resources  and  Meteorology  (I\\IIOWRAM)  as  having  the  lead  responsibility  for  water \nresources  management in  Cambodia,  in  consultation  with  other  line  ministries.  The Cambodia \nNational  Mekong  Committee  (CNMC),  reporting  to  the  Minister for Water Resources,  was  set \nup  to  liaise  between  the  RGC  and  the  Mekong  River Commission  (MRC);  it  is  responsible  for \nlinking  water management in  the  Mekong  region  with  the  water  resources  of Cambodia.  The \nTonie  Sap  Authority  (TSA) ,  chaired  by  the  Minister  for  Water  Resources,  coordinates \ndevelopment activities in the Tonie sap basin, in close coordination with  MOWRAM and  CNMC. \n\n10. \nOther ministries with  important roles  in  water resources management include the  Ministry of \nEnvironment (environmental  flows,  water quality and  adaptation  to  climate  change);  the  Ministry of \nHealth; the Ministry of Industry Mines and Energy (hydropower development and urban water supply); \nand  the  Ministry  of Rural  Development  (rural  water  supply).  The  National  Committee  for  Disaster \nManagement (NCDM) has an  important link with water resources in its response role to droughts and \nfloods. The activities of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries (MAFF) are closely linked to \nwater resources management,  both  with  respect to rain fed  agriculture and  watershed  management, \nand  with  respect to  inland  fisheries.  The  Ministry  of Public  Works  and  Transport  is  responsible  for \ninland water navigation, highways and waste water and drainage management. \n\n\u00b72\u00ad\n\n\f11. \nThe  RGC  recognizes  however,  that  while  coordination  mechanisms  exist  for  certain \nissues,  there  is  no  regular  mechanism  for  broad  inter-sectoral  coordination  of water  issues  at \nthe  national  level,  or at the  river basin  level.  With  increasing  growth  and  national  development, \nit will  become  more  pressing  for the  RGC  to take  decisions  and  actions  on  critical  areas  such \nas:  (i)  the  balance  between  competing  economic  activities  of  fisheries,  irrigated  agriculture, \nhydro-electric  power  generation,  urban, \ntourism \ndevelopment,  (ii) the extent of development on  tributary rivers  and  the  balance of upstream and \ndownstream  benefits,  (iii) the operation of major dams,  and  storage and diversion of water,  and \n(iv)  the  management  of water  quality  and  maintenance  of  ecosystem  services.  With  86%  of \nCambodia  falling  within  the  Mekong  River  Basin,  close  cooperation  and  coordination,  through \nthe  CNMC,  is  essential  to  ensure  consistency  between  national  and  regional  water  resources \nmanagement planning and  management. \n\nindustrial  and  rural  water  supply,  and \n\n12. \nThe  RGC  will  thus  review  and  strengthen  existing  inter-ministerial  arrangements  for \ncoordination of national water resources  management,  proceeding either (a) to reformulate and \nelevate  existing  coordination  structures  or  (b)  to  establish  a  new,  high  level  inter-ministerial \ncommittee.  This  committee  will  be  chaired  at the  highest  level  of RGC  and  include  Ministers \nfrom  relevant  ministries  as  members,  and  supported  by  an  inter-ministerial  secretariat.  This \nnational water resources management committee will  help determine national  policy and  decide \nmatters of national significance relating to water. \n\n13. \nTo  start  the  process,  we  plan  to  hold  a  national  seminar  to  explore  the  mandate, \nmodalities  and  operations  of the  proposed  national  water  resources  management  committee, \nand then form  inter-ministerial working groups to further develop and finalize this. WRMSDP will \nprovide  support  for  this  and  in  preparing  necessary  sub-decrees  and  regulations,  and  in  the \nformation and capacity development of the inter-ministerial secretariat. \n\nOne of the first activities of the  national  water resources  management committee will  be \n14. \nto  assess  water  resources  at  a  nationwide  scale,  and  initiate  the  preparation  of  a  National \nWater Resources Plan as called for in Article 9 of the Law on Water Resources Management.  It \nwill  promote  and  mainstream  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM),  improve  data \nmanagement  and  flood  and  drought  forecasting,  and  improve  coordination  on  adaptation  to \nclimate change. \n\nThe  RGC  also  intends  to  improve  coordination  at  the  river  basin  level.  We  recognize \n15. \nthat water follows  basin boundaries and  not provincial or district boundaries, and thus should  be \nmanaged  accordingly, as recognized  in  the  Law on Water Resources  Management (Article  10). \nWe also  recognize  that  river  basin  management  needs  to  involve  all  relevant  stakeholders  at \nthis level,  both governmental and civil SOCiety and  private sector. \n\n16.  We also  plan to  strengthen  MOWRAM's capacity for planning  and  operating at the  river \nbasin  level  and  thus  the  RGC  has  agreed  to  establish  a  pilot  activity  in  the  Stung  Sen  River \nBasin,  with  the  support  of WRMSDP,  to  develop  coordination  mechanisms  at the  river  basin \nlevel  and  good  practices for river basin  management to  be applied across Cambodia.  This  pilot \nactivity  will  build  on  existing  provincial  rural  development  council  (PRDC)  structures  and  the \nOrganic  Law,  and  include the  development of a  committee  representing  inter-provincial,  inter\u00ad\nsectoral  and  multi-stakeholders  representatives  at  the  river  basin  level.  The  pilot  activity  will \nsupport  programs  in  water  resources  assessment,  planning  and  development.  WRMSDP  will \nhelp MOWRAM hold  national consultations on  the implementing Prakas for the Sub-decrees for \nthe  Law on Water Resources Management, develop guidelines and support the development of \nthe Stung Sen committee (involving  Kampong Thom and  Preah Vihear Provinces), and  support \nand  develop  capacity  for  river  basin  planning  and  management  in  the  basin.  This  will  be  a \nprecursor of development of river basin water management plans. \n\n17. \nThe  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management  establishes  the  legal  framework for water \nresources  management but necessary sub-decrees and  implementing  regulations  have  not yet \n\n-3\u00ad\n\n\fbeen finalized and approved. The need to complete the legislative framework is  identified  in  the \nSAW and  is a priority for MOWRAM.  I am thus  requesting that the WRMSDP also supports the \ncontinuing  development  of  legislation  and  implementing  regulations  for  the  sub-decrees  in \nwater  allocation  and  licensing,  river  basin  management  and  farmer  water  user  community \n(FWUC)  establishment  and  water  quality.  Legislative  aspects  needed  for  FWUCs  include:  (i) \nensuring  that  the  FWUC  legislation  provides  sufficient  autonomy  for  farmers  to  undertake \nactivities corporately,  and  (ii) assigning  both responsibility and  rights for the infrastructure to the \nfarmer corporate body (FWUC). We plan  to  explore  legal  options to  provide farmers with  rights \nconcerning the irrigation works for which they are responsible for managing. Such rights would \ndivest  the  works  from  the  full  responsibility  of the  government  to  enhance  the  sense  of  local \nownership and  responsibility for operation and maintenance. \n\nMOWRAM  is  also  responsible  for  the  management  and  delivery  of  irrigation  services \n18. \nand we are thus also requesting assistance not just in strengthening MOWRAM's capabilities in \nwater resources  management  at a  national  and  river  basin  level,  but  also  in  service  delivery. \nMOWRAM  is  responsible  for  the  development  of  irrigation  infrastructure  (new  works  and \nrehabilitation  of existing  works), for the  operation  and  maintenance of irrigation scheme works, \nand  for  supporting  farmers  in  managing  minor  irrigation  schemes  and  works.  MOWRAM  has \nthe  capacity  to  oversee  and  develop  new  investment  projects  (dams  and  irrigation  works, \nincluding  rehabilitation)  with  external  funds  and  assistance.  However,  we  plan  to  further \nstrengthen  MOW RAM's  and  provincial  departments  of  water  resources  and  meteorology \n(PDWRAM)  capacity  and  resources  for  irrigation  operations  and  water  management,  with  a \nclearer  demarcation  of  responsibilities  between  MOWRAM,  PDWRAMs  and  FWUCs,  and \nimproved  linkages with  MAFF  provincial  department of agriculture  staff.  Staff qualifications  in \nengineering  for  irrigation  and  drainage  works  operation  and  maintenance,  and  project \nmanagement,  need  to  be  strengthened. We thus  seek assistance  in  supporting  improvements \nin  administration,  financial  accounts  and  business  processes  in  line  with  the  Government's \noverall  PFM  reform  program,  and  support  for  the  extension  of  medium-term  expenditure \nframework (MTEF) within  MOW RAM. \n\n19.  We  recognize  also  that  Cambodia  as  a  nation  needs  more  engineers  in  specific fields \nrelevant  to  water  resources  management and  irrigation.  MOWRAM  faces  many challenges  in \nengaging  and  retaining  appropriately  qualified  engineering  staff,  and  requires  an  active \napproach  to  recruitment and  placement of qualified  engineers.  The  Institut de  Technologie  du \nCambodge  (lTC)  has  a  Rural  Engineering  Department and  MOWRAM  has  its  own  Technical \nServices  Centre  (TSC).  We  plan  to  strengthen  the  Rural  Engineering  Department  of  lTC, \nreviewing  its  current  engineering  courses  and  providing  for specializations  in  water  resource \nmanagement,  irrigation  engineering,  on-farm  water  management  and  hydrology.  Training  in \nirrigation  operation and  management will  continue  through the TSC and  Department of Farmer \nWater  User  Communities  for  staff  of  MOW RAM ,  members  of  FWUCs  and  irrigators.  This \ntraining  will  include  on-farm  water  management and  irrigation  practices,  and  maintenance  of \nmajor  and  minor  irrigation  works.  These  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  MAFF  extension \nservices in agriculture. \n\n20.  We  recognize  that  maintenance  of  irrigation  infrastructure  is  essential.  Many  old \nschemes  are  being  rehabilitated  and  many new schemes  are  being  built,  all  of which  require \nattention to  ongoing  maintenance to ensure sustainable operation  over the long  term. We plan \nto  develop a national asset management inventory and  plan for operation and  management for \nirrigation  works  and  other  water  works  of  MOWRAM,  identify  10-20  year  operation  and \nmanagement  costs  and  performance  indicators,  and  assign  increased  operating  budgets  for \nirrigation works maintenance in  line with the asset management plan. \n\nThe  operation  of  irrigation  systems \n\nis  very  dependent  on  the  capabilities  and \n21. \nresponsibilities  of farmer organizations.  A  national  program  to strengthen the ability of farmers \nto  manage minor irrigation  works  has  been  in  progress  since  the  promulgation  of Circular  No \n1/1999  which  provides  for  establishing  FWUCs.  To  establish  these  FWUCs  and  other water \n\n\fuser groups requires considerable attention and a long-term program. As noted  above, we plan \nto  conduct an  inventory  of  irrigation  works  and  to  determine  MOWRAM's  and/or water  users' \nresponsibility for operation  and  maintenance for each scheme.  For works  designated  as  water \nusers'  responsibility,  we  recognize  that  two  types  of  support  are  needed,  and  thus  we  are \nrequesting WRMSDP support for:  (i) capacity development that includes the existing  programs \nof FUWC development and training of farmers,  but expanded to cover training  in  on-farm water \nmanagement  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation  works  and  (ii)  assistance  in \ndeveloping  legal  mechanisms  to  enable  farmers,  through  their  elected  FWUC,  to  cover  the \ncosts  of  operation  and  maintenance  independently.  with  appropriate  incentive  mechanisms. \nVocational training will  be  extended  to  FWUCs,  and  on-the-job training  will  be  provided  in  pilot \nirrigation schemes. We also plan to establish a matching grants program for FWUCs to access \nfunds for works and capacity building for irrigation scheme management and maintenance. \n\n22.  We  are  also  seeking  assistance  under  WRMSDP  to  rehabilitate  and  further  develop \napproximately  15,000  hectares  of existing  small- and  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes  in  the \nTonie Sap  basin within the  provinces  of Kampong Thom,  Banteay Meanchey,  and  Siem  Reap. \nThe  rehabilitation  designs  will  build  on  lessons  learned  during  the  identification  and  selection \nprocess developed  under the ongoing ADB- and Agence Fram;aise de Developpment-financed \nNorthwest Irrigation Sector Project. \n\n23.  We  believe  that  successful  implementation  of the  WRMSDP  will  help  in  making  these \nrehabilitation  investments effective and worthwhile.  Success will also help create a sound  basis \nfor future development and investment in the water and agriculture sectors. \n\nPlease accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of our highest consideration.~ \n\nKeatChhon \nDeputy Prime Minister \nMinister of Economy and  Finance \n\n- 5\u00ad\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nOutput (A): Enhanced Capacity of the Government to Manage Water Resources  \nPolicy Initiative/Objective \nA.1.
