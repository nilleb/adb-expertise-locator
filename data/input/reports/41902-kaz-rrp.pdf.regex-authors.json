RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Kazakhstan Economy: Overview and Outlook \n2.  Kazakhstan maintained solid economic growth in 2006 (over 7.4% in the first half of the \nyear), based on foreign direct investments in the energy sector, increased pipeline export \ncapacity, conservative fiscal and monetary policy that balanced the need for public investment \nwith price stability, and strong banking system regulation and supervision. The country has \nbenefited from higher oil prices and greater exports, which have increased foreign currency \ninflows and assisted debt-servicing. Kazakhstan is rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s, BBB by Standard \nand Poor\u2019s, and BBB by Fitch (all long-term issues default rating). Appendix 1 provides details \nof the country\u2019s macroeconomic outlook. \n \n3.  Nevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe economy given the potential volatility in the international oil market. Small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  and  other  manufacturing  and  service  companies  are  currently \nunderrepresented in the national economy.1 Creating conditions for and stimulating the growth \nof the corporate and SME sector is very important to diversifying the economy.2  \n \nB.  Banking and Capital Markets in Kazakhstan \n4.  Improvements in the economic and operating environment of Kazakhstan\u2019s financial \nsector have led to rapid growth in the past 5 years and more creditworthy domestic banks. In \nparticular, the Government of Kazakhstan and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the \ncentral bank, have undertaken structural reforms to promote consolidation and improve the \noverall viability of the banking system. \n \n5.  Encouraged by this improving macroeconomic environment and by robust growth, banks \nhave increased their lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year (albeit from a \nvery  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and  profitability.  This  is \nespecially true for the top performers in the first two tiers of the banking system. However, the \n                                                 \n1 The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. Because the sector is relatively \nlabor-intensive, providing approximately 40% of total employment, SME growth is inherently inclusive and pro-poor \nin nature. \n2  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kazakhstan. Manila (p. 17). The Government has a \npolicy of fostering SME development by promulgating SME laws (for instance the Law on State Support to \nDevelopment of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan) and establishing organizations to implement this \npolicy. The policy includes various support measures, provision of services via business development centers, and \nsmall business loans. An exhibition and information center (a wholly state-owned joint-stock company) supports \nSMEs. In addition, the Government set up the SME Support Fund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The \nfund\u2019s main objective is to use financial resources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for \nprojects and activities aimed at supporting SMEs. The fund is tasked to (i) broaden access to finance for SMEs, \n(ii) use state and nonstate resources to support SMEs, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide advice for \nSMEs. \n ", " 2 \n \nstrong asset growth over the past five years has put pressure on the adequacy of bank capital, \nprompting the need for Tier II capital infusions denominated especially in Tenge. Because of the \nexport- driven economy and low interest rates, banks have in the past relied heavily on dollar-\ndenominated funding and lending; however, a changing economy means that banks now need \nto move more into a tenge-denominated assets and liabilities.  \n \n6.  One of the key challenges facing the financial sector is the emergence of debt and \nequity capital markets, especially with respect to the corporate sector. To widen their access to \nfunding, many banks are keen to enter these markets. \n \nC.  Future-Flow Securitization: Overview \n1.  Securitization Background \n7.  Securitization  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  dominant  means  of  capital  formation \nthroughout the world, particularly in the United States and Europe. In developed markets, asset \nsecuritization serves a number of purposes: (i) supports public policy objectives, such as broad \nhome ownership and development of financial markets (especially capital, retail, and mortgage \nmarkets); (ii)  addressing regulatory requirements for financial institutions, especially capital \nadequacy and lending limit requirements applicable to banks; (iii) transfers risk, especially in the \ncontext of nonperforming assets and portfolio diversification; and (iv) provides an alternative \nmeans of raising finance. In developing Asia, however, securitization is underdeveloped. \n \n2.  Future-Flow Securitization and Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n8.  Future-flow securitization became popular in emerging markets in the 1990s as a way of \nreducing sovereign-related risk and providing more attractive access to international capital \nmarkets  for  issuers  in  the  stronger  emerging  markets.  A  future-flow  transaction  is  the \nsecuritization of a company\u2019s future and existing receivables. In the case of originators in \nemerging markets, such receivables originate from offshore obligors. Future-flow securitizations \nmitigate many of the sovereign risks associated with an emerging market borrower by capturing \ncash flows offshore.  \n \n9.  Future-flow investments have consistently proven themselves to investors, and over the \nyears they have successfully mitigated a variety of the risks associated with emerging market \ninvestments. No future-flow transaction has defaulted so far. \n \n10.  In Kazakhstan, future-flow transactions are only beginning to be introduced.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \nA.  Project Conceptualization \n1.  Background and ADB\u2019s Business History in Kazakhstan \n11.  ADB took its first steps in Kazakhstan with loans to Bank TuranAlem JSC ($75 million) \nand Alliance Bank JSC ($50 million).3 Both loans were disbursed in July 2006. In addition to \ntheir  direct  development  impact  in  terms  of  SME  development,  these  transactions  also \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Assistance to \nPrivate Banks in Kazakhstan. Manila. \n ", "  3\nintroduced ADB as a participant in the market. The two loans have been well received, were \nnoted in the market, and have provided a number of follow-up opportunities. \n \n12.  In  the  next  phase  of  financial  sector  development  in  Kazakhstan,  ADB  intends  to \nconcentrate on capital markets. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors endorsed the first step in this direction \nby approving in September 2006 ADB\u2019s guarantee for the DPR securitization undertaken by \nAlliance Bank JSC.4 This transaction reached financial closure in mid-November 2006.  \n \n2.  ADB Equity Investments  \n13.  ADB is considering taking an equity position in the Kazakh banking market, to further \nfoster the development of this sector and position ADB as serious market participant. \n \nIV.  JSC KAZKOMMERTSBANK \nA.  Overview  \n14.  Established in 1990, KKB is one of the leading banks in Kazakhstan. As of 30 June 2006, \nit was the market leader as measured by total assets and loans, the third largest in terms of \ndeposits, and the fourth largest in terms of the number of branches. KKB provides a full range of \ncorporate, SME, and retail banking services and insurance, pension, asset management, and \nother financial services through a network of 22 full branches and 68 outlets. The bank has a \nwell-developed alternative distribution network, including internet banking, 454 ATMs (including \n224 added since the beginning of 2004, of which 49 are multi-functional), over 3,200 point-of-\nsale terminals, and a call center. KKB\u2019s main competitors are Bank TuranAlem JSC and Halyk \nBank.  \n \n15.  KKB has a clear expansion strategy to become the leading universal bank in Kazakhstan. \nAs growth through the acquisition of a major player in Kazakh banking is not possible (for anti-\nmonopoly reasons), KKB is growing aggressively in key market areas outside its traditional \nstronghold  of  corporate  banking  (where  the  growth  potential  is  limited  because  of  strong \ncompetition from Bank TuranAlem JSC and Halyk Bank). KKB has managed to build a sizable \npresence in the retail and SME markets, which are viewed as increasingly attractive. KKB\u2019s \nstrong commercial position and good earnings profile mean it is in a good position to prosper \nfrom  economic  growth.  The  presence  of  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD) as a shareholder should help with KKB\u2019s corporate governance, funding, \nand capitalization. \n \n16.  Currently, KKB is rated by three rating agencies: Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), and \nFitch (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: KKB Bank Credit Ratings \n \nItem  Moody\u2019s  S&P  Fitch  \nLong-term  Baa1  BB+  BB+ \nOutlook  Stable  Stable  Stable \nSurvivability Assessment  Baa2  BBB  BBB \nS&P = Standard & Poor\u2019s     \nSource: Moody\u2019s,S&P, Fitch. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Guarantee for the \nDiversified Payment Rights Securitization by Alliance Bank JSC. Manila. \n ", " 4 \n \n \nB.  Business Description \n17.  Corporate  Banking.  KKB  is  the  largest  lender  to  medium-sized  companies  and \ninternational companies operating in Kazakhstan. KKB\u2019s competitive advantages in corporate \nbanking include its ability to provide larger and longer-term facilities than its peers, and its \naccess to cheaper financing. KKB currently provides payroll services to its main corporate \nclients, which is used for cross-selling into retail products. \n \n18.  Banking  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises.  KKB  is  rapidly  increasing  its \nbanking services for SMEs, a market it regards as underserved and as offering high-yielding \nlending opportunities.  \n \n19.  Retail Banking. KKB offers its retail customers a comprehensive range of products, \nincluding residential mortgages, consumer loans, e-banking, debit and credit cards, and deposit \nand current accounts. It has one of the top three positions in terms of market share, residential \nmortgages and retail loans, retail deposits, and credit cards, and ATM services. KKB had about \n253,000 retail customers as of 30 June 2006 and plans to increase its retail operations by \nexpanding its branch network to 240 by 2010 and launching an aggressive marketing campaign \nfocused on cross-selling opportunities. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n20.  The proposed transaction has two components. (i) a credit guarantee will be issued in \nfavor of investors in notes backed by DPRs originated by KKB. The total amount of the issuance \nis expected to be up to $500 million, with ADB guaranteeing up to $100 million and MBIA and \nFGIC guaranteeing the remainder; (ii) the provision of a senior or subordinated, unsecured \nTenge denominated loan of up to $50 million equivalent for onlending into the Kazakh SMEs \nand corporate market. The Guarantee is anchored to the Tenge Loan. \n \nB.  Guarantee for DPR Securitization \n1.  Overview \n21.  The proposed guarantee will be issued in favor of investors in notes backed by DPRs \noriginated by KKB. The total amount of the issuance is expected to be up to $500 million, with \nADB guaranteeing one series of notes with a face value of up to $100 million and interest \naccrued thereon.  \n \n22.  This will be the third issuance under KKB\u2019s DPR program. The first was in December \n2005 by way of a private placement. In June 2006, KKB issued two further series of notes, \nSeries 2006A and 2006B Notes, which redeemed the $50 million floating-rate notes series \n2005C in their entirety. The issuance in 2006 had a seven year final maturity.5 The new 2007 \nseries will increase KKB\u2019s maturity profile beyond the 7-year benchmark available in the market, \nso it can provide longer-term funding for its customers. ADB will assist KKB in this by providing \nits guarantee for a 10-year maturity.  \n                                                 \n5 Both series pay quarterly interest of three-month US dollar LIBOR plus 0.24%. The final expected maturity of both \nseries is in June 2013, with an average life of 5.1 years. The 2006 series notes have an underlying rating of \nBBB/Baa2 and due to the two guarantees provided by Ambac Insurance Co. and FGIC have a AAA/Aaa rating. \n ", "  5\n \n23.  This transaction would not only be one of the largest DPR deals ever worldwide, but also \nthe first to reach a 10-year maturity. ADB\u2019s decision was used by KKB to convince the two other \nguarantors to match ADB\u2019s maturity.  \n \n2.  KKB\u2019s Diversified Payment Rights \na.  Introduction \n24.  DPRs  usually  take  the  form  of  SWIFT6  MT102,  103,7  and  202  payment  order \nmessages. 8   These  payment  orders  are  generated  as  part  of  the  international  financial \noperations  of  KKB.  Payment  orders  are  created  as  a  result  of  KKB\u2019s  role  as  a  financial \nintermediary between foreign payors wishing to send funds to Kazakhstan and residents of \nKazakhstan receiving these funds. KKB proposes to securitize its MT100 DPRs, denominated in \nUS dollars.  \n \n25.  KKB generates DPRs by acting as a recipient of payment orders, which arise through a \nvariety of transactions, including from exporters inside Kazakhstan selling goods or services to \ncustomers  outside  Kazakhstan,  foreign  direct  investment,  \u201cKazakhstan  flows\u201d,9   overseas \ntransportation,  and  personal  remittances.  The  payors,  who  wish  to  make  payments  to \nbeneficiaries in Kazakhstan with accounts with KKB Bank, request their banks (payor banks), in \nthe majority of cases located outside Kazakhstan, to initiate transactions for the payment of \namounts to beneficiaries in Kazakhstan through KKB, thereby generating payment orders. 10\n \n26.  Processing payment orders is a basic banking business that offers significant benefits \nincluding the ability to (i) strengthen correspondent banking relationships and obtain favorable \nterms on other banking products and businesses from correspondent banks; (ii) attract new \nclients in cases where payment orders are the initial contact the client has with KKB and monitor \nKKB\u2019s borrower\u2019s cash flows, (iii) provide high-quality clearing services to clients in Kazakhstan, \n(iv) generate foreign currency, (v) expand daily treasury activity, and (vi) improve liquidity.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nThe BBB underlying rating on the series 2006A and 2006B notes reflects the rating agencies survivability \nassessment of KKB, i.e., its ability to generate the necessary assets to service the transaction even under a state \nof selective default or other financial impairment, over the term of the transaction and other structural features that \nmitigate sovereign interference risk and other credit risks. \n6  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is an international messaging system \nowned and maintained by the member banks (payment order only, no settlement). MT103/103+ are sent by the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction.  \n7  MT102 is principally a set of bulked customer transfers that meet certain criteria (e.g., common correspondent \nbanks, common currency or common value date). MT103 is a customer transfer wherein either the sending party or \nthe payer or both is not a financial institution. MT103 is a more structured version. MT202 relates to payment \norders from senders to payees that are financial institutions. \n8  MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through banks. MT200 \n(including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders to payees \nthat are financial institutions. \n9  As a result of current Kazakhstan currency regulation, a Kazakhstan resident cannot make a foreign-currency-\ndenominated payment in favor of another Kazakhstan resident. However, he or she may transfer his or her own \nfunds from an account with one Kazakhstan bank in favor of another account held with another Kazakhstan bank. \nSuch a payment order would be settled outside Kazakhstan. \u201cKazakhstan flows\u201d are collections that arise when a \nKazakhstan bank (whether through a branch, representative office, or other office located inside or outside \nKazakhstan) or a foreign bank\u2019s Kazakhstan branch or other office has initiated a payment order. \u201cKazakhstan \nflows\u201d are often the result of Kazakhstan companies moving their own dollar and euro funds. \n10 Excluded are payments related to Western Union, credit card payments, and check payments settled through KKB. \nAppendix 17 provides a detailed description of a MT100 payment flow. \n ", " 6 \n \n \nb.  Depository Banks \n27.  Payment orders received by KKB are effected by making a deposit into one of the KKB \naccounts held with one of its correspondent banks (the depositary banks). These \u201cdesignated \ndepositary banks\u201d (DDBs) are correspondent banks that KKB has chosen because of their \nexisting relationship with KKB, their credit quality, and their experience with DPRs.  \n   \n3.  Notes Issuance \n28.  Issuer. The special purpose vehicle (SPV), KKB DPR Company, will issue up to three \nseries of notes. The issuance is expected to be listed either in London or Luxembourg. The \nnotes will be distributed under Rule 144A in the United States of America.  \n \n29.  Structure of the Issuance. The issued notes will have a fixed or floating rate. Principal \nrepayment  will  be  amortized.  Investors  will  be  entitled  to  quarterly  interest  payments  and \nprincipal  payments,  in  accordance  with  the  transaction's  amortization  schedule.  On  each \nquarterly payment date, the trustee will make the scheduled debt service payments to the \ninvestors.  \n \n30.  Pricing of the Notes. The notes issued by the SPV and guaranteed by ADB are not \nexpected to compete directly with any ADB bond issues. Despite both issues having the same \nratings (AAA), the spread of the ADB bonds is expected to be tighter, reflecting the risks of ADB \nas the ultimate borrower. Pricing of the SPV notes will incorporate a prepayment risk, since KKB \ncan choose to buy back the notes from the note holders in the event that it wants to stop paying \nguarantee fees to ADB and its credit rating improves to a level where reissuing would be less \nexpensive in case of a trigger event. Investors buying the notes are not seeking an ADB bond; \nthey will have to price in the risk of prepayment, other structural features of the notes, and the \nilliquidity of the paper (essentially buy and hold), all of which will justify a higher yield than for a \nregular ADB bond.  \n \n4.  Expected Rating \n31.  Moody\u2019s and Standard & Pors are expected to provide shadow ratings of the notes. The \nratings are expected to be up to Baa2 for Moody\u2019s and BBB for Standard & Poors. The rating \nupgrade  (as  compared  to  KKB\u2019s  corporate  rating)  will  be  based  on  (i)  the  structural \nenhancements built into the transaction, which will include certain DSCR and rating triggers, \nand (ii) the respective rating agency\u2019s bank survivability assessment of KKB that will mitigate \nsovereign and certain bank credit risks.11 The survivability assessment also looks at potential \nsupport by the regulator in case of the bank\u2019s default or insolvency.12 Rating agencies generally \n                                                 \n11  Ratings of future flow transactions are tied to the credit quality of the originator, which is typically measured by its \nlocal currency issuer default rating, which could be rated higher than the company\u2019s local currency issuer default \nrating after considering the company\u2019s ability to continue operating beyond a general default and generate \nreceivables for the duration of the deal. The rating agencies generally assume that banks will be able to continue \ntheir business, even in case of default, especially with respect to a core business like DPRs. In addition, \nGovernment support for the top five banks is expected in Kazakhstan. The going concern assessment (Fitch \nmethodology) and survivability assessment (Moody\u2019s) address these issues. Achieving a rating at this level is \ntherefore a twofold concept: The company must not only continue to generate these receivables by producing and \ndelivering the product, but the collections from the receivables must also be legally protected through a true sale \nstructure. Both aspects are fulfilled for a Kazakh DPR securitization. \n12 The central bank\u2019s support for banking has been mixed. In the first instance, Kramds Bank, at the time the fifth \nlargest bank in terms of assets and a privately owned bank, was liquidated in October 1996 despite its size and \napparent importance. The bank was insolvent because of the high level of bad loans. Before the liquidation, the \n ", "  7\nsee the involved volume risk, devaluation exposure, obligor risk, and sovereign redirection risk \nin a DPR securitization as low compared to corporate transactions. \n \n5.  Terms and Conditions of the Guarantee \n32.  Guarantee Coverage. ADB will guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on \nthe  notes.  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  will  be  unconditional  and  irrevocable,  and  documented  in \naccordance with market standards for this type of transaction and at the same terms and \nconditions as those for the other two guarantee companies. \n \n33.  Exclusions and Limits on Coverage. ADB will not guarantee (i) any failure to pay by \nhedge  counterparties,  (ii)  any  \u201cmake-whole  redemption\u201d  premium,  (iii)  taxes  on  the  Series \n2007B Notes, (iv) default or overdue interest, and (v) accelerated principal (whether or not as \nthe  result  of  an  early  amortization  event  or  a  sale  recision  event).  Further,  ADB  will  not \nguarantee the repayment of the Series 2007B Notes prior to a scheduled quarterly amortization \ndate. \n \n34.  Guarantee Fee. ADB will receive a guarantee fee, the amount of which will be based on \nsimilar DPR securitization structures in Kazakhstan and Turkey. The guarantee fee will be set in \naccordance with ADB policies by the guarantee committee. \n \nC.  Tenge-denominated Unsecured Loan \n35.  ADB is proposing a senior or subordinated, unsecured loan for up to the equivalent of \n$50 million, denominated in tenge. The main terms and conditions are (i) a 5-year maturity, \n(ii) amortization of the loan, with a grace period to determined, (iii) a fixed or floating interest rate \nto be determined by the ADB interest rate committee, (iv) an underwriting fee of 0.50% to 1.0%, \nand (v) a commitment fee of up to 0.5%. The loan would be used for SME and corporate \nonlending. Instead of senior debt the loan may also be structured as subordinated debt, with an \nindicative maturity of up to 8 years (or the minimum regulatory requirement for Tier II capital). \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS \nA.  Justification  \n1.  Investment Objective \n36.  ADB\u2019s objective in the proposed Guarantee and Tenge Loan is to develop Kazakhstan\u2019s \nbanking and securitization market in order to (i) diversify funding options, (ii) allow access to \nlonger term funds, (iii) increase onlending to SMEs, and (iii) attract a new set of investors.  \n \n37.  Provision  of  Guarantee. ADB\u2019s proposed Guarantee will increase interest in DPR \nsecuritization from Kazakhstan. By further cementing a credit history for KKB, the proposed \n                                                                                                                                                          \ncentral bank provided Kramds Bank with financial and technical support to try to return the bank to solvency, but \nproblems were irremediable. In 1997, the central bank decided to support Turan Bank and Alem Bank, at that time \nthe fourth and second largest banks. The banks were insolvent because of a very high level of problem loans. The \ntwo banks were merged to form Bank TuranAlem in 1997 by setting aside $90 million for the bank\u2019s recapitalization. \nBank TuranAlem no longer has any significant problems and was privatized in 1998, which restored public \nconfidence. The central bank intervened to support smaller banks affected by the Russian crisis of 1998. In the \ninitial stage of banking restructuring between 1992 and 1995, the central bank\u2019s response to the high level of \nproblem loans was to transfer them to state-owned banks and entities. The rating agencies therefore expect \nGovernment support in case of a sector crisis. \n ", " 8 \n \nProject enhances its ability to raise funds in the international capital markets and obtain longer \ntenor funds than currently possible in the market. KKB\u2019s business lines generating DPRs will be \nunder constant scrutiny by rating agencies forcing KKB to adopt and comply with best market \npractices. The DPR Transaction will boost investor and creditor confidence, both international \nand domestic, in Kazakhstan\u2019s banking system, and increase depositor confidence in the local \neconomy and banking system. The DPR Transaction allows KKB to extend the tenor of its \nborrowings to up to 10 years, 3 years longer than the maximum tenor it has been able to obtain \nfrom the market. In turn KKB will be able to lengthen its tenor for its customers. The DPR \nTransaction will therefore bridge an unwanted maturity gap and allow KKB to match its assets \nand liabilities more closely. In addition, the securitization will allow KKB to access lower cost \nfunds, which will make KKB more competitive and allow it to pass savings to its customers. \n \n38.  Tenge Loan. ADB\u2019s second objective is to foster Tenge-denominated corporate and \nSME financing. ADB is assisting the Government to steer the economy toward more sustainable \ncorporate-led growth and away from dependence on natural resource industries.  \n \n39.  If the Tenge Loan is structured as subordinated debt (Tier II capital), this will help KKB \nachieve sustainable growth.  Such structure could be replicated by other other Kazahk banks \nfollowing the KKB Tier II capital management model. \n \n40.  In a country with a rapidly developing economy and a fast growing banking sector such \nas Kazakhstan, there is inevitable pressure on banks\u2019 capital adequacy. Access to subordinated \ndebt, which counts as Tier II capital, is key to addressing this issue. ADB would be the first \ninstiution to offer this product denominated in Tenge. With this project, ADB will therefore \nsupport the development and growth of a sustainable banking sector. \n \n41.  Banks make use of subordinated debt as a capital instrument\u2014i.e., to achieve their \nregulatory capital requirements. This is a common practice worldwide and prevalent even in \nrelatively unsophisticated markets. The key feature of subordinated debt is that in the case of a \nliquidation of the bank, subordinated creditors will be paid only after all senior creditors have \nbeen repaid in full. Any call or pre-payment of subordinated debt would typically be subject to \ncompliance with minimum capital ratios (after the call) and/or require approval by the regulator. \n \n42.  ADB Bond Issue. ADB\u2019s third objective is to issue its first domestic bond in Kazakhstan \nand therefore to establish a benchmark for AAA risk in the country and foster the development \nof the local bond market. \n \n2.  Development Outcome \n43.  Corporate-led Growth. The Government is striving to diversify the economy and reduce \nKazakhstan\u2019s dependence on oil. This entails improving the access of the non-oil sectors to \nfinance and making these sectors more attractive to investors. The DPR Transaction seeks to \nachieve this by helping develop the capital market through diversifying funding sources for \nborrowers and increasing the availability of investment grade products for investors.  \n \n44.  Although the concept of DPR securitization is not entirely new to Kazakhstan, there have \nbeen only a few issues, the only ones completed in Asia. They form part of a handful of future-\nflow transactions executed so far in Asia. An increase in the number of DPR securitizations will \nimprove the understanding of this financing technique. This proposal is expected to facilitate the \ndevelopment of a full-scale securitization market in Kazakhstan, and to have spillover effects \nelsewhere in the region. \n ", "  9\n \n45.  The proposed DPR Transaction will allow KKB to service its core businesses and to \nexpand its financing of SMEs and other companies\u2014including those in rural areas\u2014via the \nexisting and growing branch network of KKB, as well as to foster diversification of its loan \nportfolios.  \n \n46.  Increase Access to International Capital Markets. DPR securitization is designed to \nmitigate  sovereign  risk  so  that  non-investment-grade  borrowers  can  access  longer-term \nfinancing at lower interest rates than they could by borrowing directly. The innovative structuring \nof  these  transactions  has  allowed  many  non-investment-grade  borrowers  in  developing \ncountries to obtain financing at significantly lower interest costs and for longer durations. ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement as guarantor will enhance KKB\u2019s credit rating.  \n \n47.  Securitization of future-flow and existing receivables can provide a way of raising finance \nfor many low-income and, in particular, middle-income countries, especially during times of low \nliquidity  and  heightened  perception  of  sovereign  risk.  During  a  liquidity  crisis,  developing \ncountries  need  innovative  ways  of  raising  finance.  Future-flow  receivables  securitization \nprovides a way of securing credit ratings for new issues that reduce sovereign-related risk and \nthereby of reducing the cost of funding. Future-flow securitizations also attract a much wider \nclass of investors because of their investment grade rating. Moreover, by establishing a credit \nhistory for the borrower, these deals enhance its ability to access capital markets in the future \nand reduce the costs. \n \n48.  From the investors\u2019 point of view, the attractiveness of this asset class lies in its good \ncredit rating and its stellar performance in good and bad times. No debt defaults on rated future- \nflow asset-backed securities issued by developing country entities have been recorded, despite \nrepeated liquidity and solvency crises.13\n \n49.  DPR flow securitization has not been available in Central Asia or other parts of Asia, \nexcept for Kazakhstan. It would be suitable to such countries as Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Pakistan, \nand the Philippines. ADB has already been approached by lead managers in other markets and \nwill need to build its reputation and expertise in this field.  \n \n50.  As local banks realize the funding advantages inherent in packaging securitized DPR \nflows, they will become more competitive in terms of fees charged for DPRs and remittance \ntransfers. This will encourage both senders and beneficiaries to become bank clients and \nthereby enter the formal banking system. \n \n51.  Improve Finances of Local Banks. Tenge-denominated debt and securitization will \nhelp improve the asset and liability management of local banks by providing them with access to \nfunding  that  is  free  from  foreign  exchange  risk,  has  a  longer  term,  and  is  cheaper. \nImprovements in the banks\u2019 finances will in turn improve the stability of the region\u2019s banking \nsystem. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13  The asset class withstood the test of the Mexican peso crisis in 1994\u20131995, the Asian liquidity crisis in 1997\u20131998, \nand the Ecuadorian debt default in 1999. A receivable transaction with of PTCL, Pakistan's telephone company, \ncontinued to perform even in the face of a selective default on sovereign debt. \n ", " 10 \n \n3.  Value Added of ADB  \n52.  ADB\u2019s proposed Guarantee will add value by (i) enabling wider distribution of the Series \n2007B Notes, especially to Asian investors; (ii) increasing and diversifying funding sources and \ninvestment products; (iii) providing access to longer-term financing for KKB; (iv)  helping to \ndevelop  the  securitization  market  in  Kazakhstan;  and  (v) increasing  investor  confidence  in \nKazakhstan\u2019s relatively young banking and capital market. ADB\u2019s proposed Tenge Loan will \nprovide value by (i) developing the SME market in Kazakhstan, in general; and (ii) assisting \nKKB  in  its  transition  into  local  currency  operations  and  improving  its  capital  adequacy \nrequirments, in particular. \n \n4.  Development Impact Measurement \n53.  ADB will measure the expected development impact of the Project. Its performance \nmeasures will follow the Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations of \nthe Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral development banks. Development impact \nis measured in three distinct categories: (i) business performance of the project, (ii) economic \nsustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Appendix 2 shows the development impact \nframework. \n \n54.  ADB will discuss with KKB the inclusion of EBRD\u2019s monitoring standards for the usage of \nits funds under the proposed Tenge Loan. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n55.  The  proposed  Tenge  Loan  has  been  assigned  a  Category  \u201cFI\u201d  environmental \nclassification  and  is  classified  as  Category  \u201cC\u201d  with  respect  to  indigenous  people  and \nresettlement. KKB will be required to establish an environmental management system and to \nbuild  capacity  for  implementing  it.  At  least  one  KKB  officer  will  attend  ADB-sponsored \nenvironmental  management  training.  It  should  be  noted  however  that  the  social  and \nenvironmental safeguard policies of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nare already in place and that the EMS, which is based on EBRD standards, conforms to ADB \nstandards.  \n \n56.  A desk review of KKB\u2019s DPR operations shows that these activities will have no adverse \nimpacts with respect to the environment. Thus, on a stand-alone basis, the proposed Guarantee \nwould be assigned a Category \u201cC\u201d environmental classification. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n57.  KKB has been advised of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.14 KKB will \nundertake to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best practice standards for preventing corruption, money laundering activities, and \nthe  financing  of  terrorism  in  the  insurance  and  indemnity  agreements.  Further,  KKB  will \nundertake to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and \nKKB will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2003.

ADB will enter into acceptable guarantee and loan agreements and other required legal \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed Guarantee and Tenge Loan by the Board. These \nagreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n59.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its lending and guarantee operations in the private sector is in effect between Kazakhstan \nand  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed ADB guarantee \nand tenge loan to KKB. The Guarantee will not become effective and no funding under the \nTenge Loan will be made available until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n60.  I am satisfied that the proposed guarantee and tenge-denominated loan would comply \nwith the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the  \nBoard approve (i) the Guarantee of up to $100 million of principal and accrued interest for notes \nwith a maturity of 10 years; (ii) the proposed unsecured Tenge denominated loan of up to $50 \nmillion equivalent, both on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin this report, and as may be reported to the Board; and (iii) the proposal that ADB\u2019s investment \nthrough the Guarantee and the Tenge Loan exceed the exposure limit of $75 million in any \nsingle investment. \n \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n \n \n28 February 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1   \nKAZAKHSTAN: MAJOR MACROECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS \n \nA.  Economic Assessment and Outlook \n \n1.  High world oil prices, strong domestic consumption, and buoyant investment underlie the \ncontinuing economic boom in this oil-rich export economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil subsector, averaged 10.4% per annum during 2001\u20132006. GDP growth \nreached 10.6% in 2006 and is set to grow annually by an average of 9% during 2007\u20132009 \n(increasing from $78 billion in 2006 to $140 billion in 2009). Furthermore, representing 65% of \nGDP, the private sector is increasingly driving growth in the economy.1  \n \n2.  The fiscal position remained robust in 2006, owing to high world oil prices and improved \ntax administration. Despite an expansionary fiscal policy, mainly associated with large salary \nincreases, the general government budget still recorded a surplus; though it contracted from 2% \nof GDP in 2005 to 0.8% of GDP at the end of 2006.  \n \n3.  High world commodity prices in 2006 helped boost exports by 37.3% to $38.2 billion; oil \nand metals continued to be major export items, accounting for more than two thirds of the \nincrease. Although imports also increased by almost 37%, the trade surplus expanded by 38% \nto $12.2 billion. While the deficit on the services, income, and transfers account has widened, \nthe current account recorded a surplus at 0.3% of GDP at the end of the third quarter of 2006.  \n \n4.  Gross official reserves (including the assets of the National Fund of the Republic of \nKazakhstan) doubled, totaling $30 billion in 2006 (equivalent to about 5 months of imports of \ngoods and services); while year-end foreign asset holdings of the National Fund, which saves a \npart of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral revenues for future generations, amounted to $14 \nbillion. Outstanding public external debt fell to $1.7 billion (or 2% of GDP) by the end of 2006. In \ncontrast, the stock of private sector external debt (excluding oil and gas intracompany debt) \nsurged by $16 billion in 2006 to $33 billion (or 42% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in \nrecent  years\u2014mainly  local  bank  borrowing  for  onlending\u2014was  largely  a  response  to  the \ndifferential between available foreign borrowing rates and domestic lending rates.  \n \n5.  Led by the strong increase in public wages, buoyant oil revenues, and credit boom, \ninflation picked up to 8.6%, higher than the Government target of 7.0%. Structural rigidities that \nlimit competition in certain segments of the economy also contributed in part to rising inflation. \nTo subdue inflation, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) endeavored to reduce excess \nliquidity in the economy by (i) increasing the refinancing rate from 8% to 9%, (ii) strengthening \nthe minimum bank reserve requirements, (iii) sterilizing extra foreign exchange inflow, and (iv) \nallowing tenge appreciation. However, despite all these measures, broad money growth rose by \n60% in 2006, compared to 29% in 2005.   \n  \n6.  In 2006, the tenge appreciated strongly against the dollar (7.7% on average) as a result \nof strong export earnings, foreign direct investment, and private external borrowing. Largely \nbecause  of  future  substantial  oil-related  revenues,  real  appreciation  may  continue  in  the \nmedium term.  \n \n7.  The medium-term outlook for the economy is positive, assuming high world oil prices, \nbuoyant  foreign  direct  investment  inflows,  strong  domestic  consumption,  continuation  of \n                                                 \n1 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Merrill Lynch estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in \n1998. \n ", "    Appendix 1  13\neconomic  diversification,  good  macroeconomic  management,  and  political  stability.  In  the \nmedium term, GDP is expected to grow at an average of 9%; the Government\u2019s target is to \ndouble  GDP  by  2008  in  comparison  to  the  2000  level.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  efforts, \ninflation is expected to rise above the current NBK target (6\u20137%), mainly because of the excess \ndomestic demand, an expansionary fiscal policy, and buoyant oil-related business incomes. \nDriven by the hydrocarbons sector, exports are projected to surge by 10% on average per year. \nThis  strong  growth  will  be  supported  by  greater  oil  production  and  continued  high  world \ncommodity prices. Imports are also forecast to rise, driven by strong domestic consumption and \na boost in investments.  \n \nB.  Political and Regional Background \n \n8.  Kazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution of the former Soviet Union. Since then, Kazakhstan has experienced significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy to a market-oriented, democratic model. The transition was initially marked by political \nuncertainty and tension, a recessionary economy marked by high inflation and instability of the \nlocal currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \n9.  Since 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program of economic reform designed \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation; it \nis  more  advanced  in  this  respect  than  some  other  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States. However, as with any transition economy, no assurance can be given that \nsuch reforms and other reforms described elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such \nreforms will achieve all or any of their intended aims. \n \n10.  Kazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, and \nwheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent on good relations with its neighbors to ensure its ability to \nexport. In addition to taking various steps to promote regional economic integration among \nneighboring countries, Kazakhstan signed an agreement in September 2003 with Belarus, the \nRussian Federation, and Ukraine to create a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin common economic policies, harmonization of legislation implementing such policies, and \ncreation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone is to \ncreate a free customs area within which member countries would enjoy free movement of \ngoods, services, capital, and labor. Another step toward integration, which is being considered \nby member countries, is the coordination of their fiscal policies, credit and currency policies, and \ngovernment  policies.  These  efforts  will  support  further  economic  integration  within  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access \nto export routes. \n \nC.  Macroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n \n11.  Since  Kazakhstan  is  heavily  dependent  on  export  trade  and  commodity  prices,  its \neconomy was severely affected by the Asian financial crisis in July 1997 and by the Russian \ncrisis  in  1998,  both  of  which  caused  world  commodity  prices  to  plummet.  To  protect \nKazakhstan\u2019s economy from low commodity prices and economic instability elsewhere in the \nworld,  the  Government  has  promoted  economic  reform,  inward  foreign  investment,  and \ndiversification of the economy. Notwithstanding these efforts, low commodity prices and weak \ndemand in its export markets may adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019s economy in the future. \n \n ", "14  Appendix 1   \n12.  The  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \nincluding (i) a significant privatization program, (ii) promotion of high levels of foreign direct \ninvestment (particularly in the oil and gas sectors), and (iii) introduction of an extensive legal \nframework.  Despite  uneven  progress,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  extensive  economic \ntransformation over the last 12 years. Since mid-1994, the Government has adhered to a \nmacroeconomic stabilization program aimed at curtailing inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and \nboosting  international  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s \nNational Statistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following the adoption of a \nfloating exchange rate policy in April 1999. GDP rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in 2002, 9.2% in \n2003, 9.6% in 2004, 9.5% in 2005, and 10.6% in 2006. However, no assurance can be given \nthat GDP will continue to grow, and any decrease in GDP or in the rate of GDP growth in \nsubsequent years could adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019s development. \n \n13.  The tenge is convertible for current account transactions, but it is not a fully convertible \ncurrency outside Kazakhstan. Between 1991, when Kazakhstan began its transition to a market-\nbased economy, and April 1999, NBK maintained a managed exchange rate policy, which, \nalthough permitting the exchange rate to reflect market conditions, involved official intervention \naimed  at  limiting  fluctuations.  Depressed  export  markets  in  1998  and  early  1999  put \nconsiderable  pressure  on  Kazakhstan\u2019s  managed  exchange  rate.  The  resulting  official \nintervention in the foreign exchange markets led to losses on foreign currency reserves. In \nresponse to these pressures, the authorities instituted a number of expenditure cuts, took \nrevenue-increasing measures, and in April 1999, floated the tenge. The tenge fell by 64.6% \nagainst the dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation of 10.7% as of 31 \nDecember 1998. Following the adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in 1999, the tenge \ncontinued to depreciate against the dollar, although at a much slower rate. It depreciated by \n4.6% in 2000, 3.8% in 2001, and 3.3% in 2002. The tenge subsequently appreciated against the \ndollar by 7.3% in 2003 and 9.9% in 2004. Then during the first 6 months of 2005, it depreciated \nagainst  the  dollar  by  4.0%,  to  T135.26.  Since  30  June  2005,  the  tenge  has  gradually \nappreciated against the dollar. On 30 October 2006, NBK reported the official T/$ exchange rate \nas T127.98/$1.00. \n \n14.  While NBK has stated that it has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate policy, \nany  subsequent  decision  to  support  the  exchange  rate  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on \nKazakhstan\u2019s public finances and economy. \n \nD.  Monetary Policy \n \n15.  NBK maintains a managed floating currency regime and does not set any official targets \nfor the tenge exchange rate. It uses interventions on the foreign exchange market as one of the \ntools to manage systemic liquidity. Monetary policy implementation is complicated by strong \nprivate capital inflows, rising oil earnings, and buoyant domestic demand. Broad money supply \n(M3) rose 49.7% per annum on average during 2000\u20132005, and was up a further 58% in 2006. \nCash in circulation expanded 34% per annum on average during 2000\u20132004, and increased \nanother 35% in 2005. The big build-up of money in the National Reserve Fund ($14 billion, or \n18% of GDP as of the end of 2006), along with selling short-term notes and deposits, has \nassisted  partial  sterilization  of  the  domestic  liquidity  produced  by  NBK  interventions. \nNevertheless, the authorities are worried about the rise in monetary pressure on the overall \ninflation process. With no formal target, the Government aims to keep annual inflation in the 5\u2013\n7% range during 2006\u20132008 to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment, while in 2006 the \nconsumer price index increased to 8.6%. During the next 2 years, stronger social spending \nalong with further tax cuts will continue to put upward pressure on disposable income growth \n ", "    Appendix 1  15\nand consequently on prices. Market observers therefore expect that with some easing of the \ntight fiscal stance, greater exchange rate flexibility will be allowed to keep inflation in check. \nNBK might allow the tenge to appreciate in 2007\u20132008 to restrain further price expansion. \n \nE.  Regulation of the Banking Industry \n \n16.  In September 1995, NBK introduced strict prudential requirements for the operation and \ncapital adequacy of banks. In addition, an institutional development plan was prepared for \nleading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to prepare their accounts \nin  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  to  apply  the  Basel \nCommittee  norms  within  the  period  determined  by  NBK  on  a  case-to-case  basis.  Further, \nKazakhstan banks are required to join a bank-funded deposit insurance scheme and be audited \nannually by a public accountancy firm approved by NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading \ninternational  firms.  Following  legislative  changes  in  July  2003,  the  Financial  Markets \nSupervisory Agency was formed, and as of 1 January 2004, it took responsibility for most of the \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  financial  sector,  which  had  previously  been \nperformed by NBK. The agency\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial markets \nand financial institutions in Kazakhstan. \n \nF.  Implementation of Market-Based Economic Reforms \n \n17.  The need for substantial investment in many enterprises has driven the Government\u2019s \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant by the Government, although major privatizations in key sectors have taken place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational telecommunication company. However, a need remains for substantial investment in \nmany sectors of the Kazakhstan economy and in some areas economic performance in the \nprivate sector is still constrained by inadequate business infrastructure. Furthermore, the extent \nof noncash transactions in the economy and the size of the shadow economy adversely affect \nimplementation of reforms and hamper the efficient collection of taxes. The Government has \nstated that it intends to address these problems by improving bankruptcy procedures, business \ninfrastructure,  and  tax  administration;  as  well  as  by  continuing  the  privatization  process. \nImplementation of these measures in the short term has produced few positive results, and \nimproved results may not materialize until the medium term, if at all. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "16  Appendix 20 \nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.
