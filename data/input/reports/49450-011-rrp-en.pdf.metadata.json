Upon approval, the Board delegated authority to \nthe President to approve loans and/or grants to each targeted country for qualifying projects. \n \n2. \nfinanced under the facility. \n \n3. \nThe  project  will  rehabilitate  the  Majuro  tank  farm  (MTF),  the  fuel  handling  and  storage \nfacilities built in 1981 and operated by Marshalls Energy Company (MEC) on Majuro Atoll. The \nMTF  comprises  eight  750,000-gallon  (2.84  million-liter)  above-ground  steel  storage tanks,  two \nsmaller  intermediate  transfer  tanks,  and  associated  piping  and  pumping  infrastructure.  Power \ngeneration throughout the Marshall Islands is dependent on fuel delivered by MEC through the \nMTF, as is domestic and international maritime transport operating in  Marshall Islands waters. \nThe  MTF  has  become  dilapidated  because  of  the  harsh  operating  environment  and  chronic \ninadequate maintenance practices and budgeting. The project will return the MTF to compliance \nwith  applicable  industry  standards  and  will  institute  policies  and  operating  practices  (including \npersonnel training) to provide for appropriate maintenance to ensure its sustainability. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nMacroeconomic  context.  The  Marshall  Islands  is  heavily  dependent  on  external \nassistance, with annual grants averaging 60% of gross domestic product (GDP), mostly through \nthe  Compact  of  Free  Association  (COFA)  with  the  United  States,  which  terminates  in  2023. \nUnemployment is high and human development indicators are generally low; income distribution \nis quite uneven and poverty on the outer atolls is considerable. When grant flows from the COFA \ndeclined  during  1995\u20132001,  per  capita  GDP  over  the  same  period  dropped  by  nearly  35%. \nEconomic  growth  accelerated  from  0.6%  in  FY2015  to  1.5%  in  FY2016  because  of  stronger \nfisheries  output  and  the  resumption  of  infrastructure  projects  connected  with  the  COFA.  ADB \nestimates growth of 4.0% in FY2017 and forecasts 2.5% in FY2018,2 and an economic review \nprepared through Graduate School USA expects average GDP growth of 1.7% through FY2025.3 \n \n5. \nRenewable energy investment demand. MEC is a fully state-owned electricity utility that \ngenerates, distributes, and retails electricity on Majuro to a population of about 28,000 (roughly \nhalf of the Marshall Islands\u2019 population). Serving the country\u2019s capital, the Majuro system accounts \nfor 72% of electricity generated and consumed in the Marshall Islands. Ebeye in Kwajalein Atoll \naccounts for an additional 24%, while the outer islands make up the balance. Renewable power \ngeneration in the Marshall Islands is negligible; nearly all power delivered to customers on Majuro \nis  generated  from  diesel  fuel.  While  the  Government  of  the  Marshall  Islands  has  established \nambitious  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  and  renewable  energy  targets  based  on  its \nnationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (implying a required 50% \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Honolulu: Graduate School USA Pacific Islands Training Initiative. \n\n \n\n \n\n\freduction  in  diesel  consumption  for  power  generation  by  2025),4  achieving  these  targets  will \nrequire  an  investment  of  at  least  $120  million.5  Funding  for  these  investments  has  not  been \nidentified. Responsible sector investment planning demands that existing plant and infrastructure, \nincluding the MTF, be maintained and preserved until they become obsolete and are replaced by \nalternative plants and technologies. \n \n6. \nUrgency of tank farm rehabilitation. The MTF was commissioned in 1981 and appears \nto  have  been  designed  and  soundly  constructed  in  compliance  with  applicable  codes  and \nstandards.  However,  its  current  condition  is  very  poor\u2014a  consequence  of  many  years  of \ninadequate  maintenance  in  a  harsh  and  corrosive  marine  environment  that  is  subject  to \natmospheric  salt  spray  from  all  directions.  All  tanks  and  above-ground  piping  show  significant \nsigns of corrosion. The concrete bunding also exhibits deterioration. Concrete flooring under tanks \nhas eroded significantly, exacerbating corrosion and causing stress on the steel tanks\u2019 welding \njoints. Critical safety and security features, such as ladders, bannisters, and basic lighting, have \nalso deteriorated or are entirely absent. \n \nThe MTF is a critical facility and the cornerstone of the Marshall Islands\u2019 energy security. \n7. \nIts dilapidated and rapidly deteriorating condition is a severe risk to the Marshall Islands economy, \nthe population\u2019s well-being, and the local environment. The risk of catastrophic failure of the tanks \nand  associated  infrastructure  (pumping  equipment,  piping,  and  containment  bunding)  is \nsignificant.  Such  failure  will  likely  result  in  an  acute  and  prolonged  shortage  of  fuel  for  power \ngeneration,  a  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  and  extraordinarily  high  costs  for \nremediation and interim alternative supply of fuel, as well as loss of revenue for MEC from fuel \nsales to commercial marine fleets. \n \n8. \nRehabilitation  of  the  MTF  will  preserve  the  Marshall  Islands\u2019  energy  security,  while \nmitigating  risks  associated  with potential  catastrophic failure.  MEC\u2019s  fuel  supply  to commercial \nmaritime  transport  and  fishing  fleets  also  contributes  significantly  to  the  Marshall  Islands\u2019 \neconomy  and  is  a  revenue  source  for  MEC  that  helps  support  its  other  operations  (power \ngeneration and sales). \n \n9. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Through technical assistance (TA), ADB is supporting \nMEC in its reforms to ensure its future as a viable and sustainable commercial public enterprise.6 \nThe rehabilitation of the MTF under the project will take place while the reform measures that this \nTA is preparing are being implemented. ADB is also implementing a grant to the Marshall Islands \nfor improving the power network distribution in Majuro,7 and considering a waste-to-energy project \nthat will contribute to the Marshall Islands\u2019 renewable energy targets and an additional network \nstrengthening investment project. Implementation of the reform measures that will be developed \nunder the TA will form part of the planned future investments. \n \nDevelopment coordination. The project will be implemented alongside investments and \n10. \ntechnical  assistance  supported  by  other  development  partners,  including  the  World  Bank,  the \nEuropean Union, Japanese International Cooperation Agency, the Government of New Zealand, \n\n                                                \n4  In its NDCs, the Marshall Islands set a target of a 45% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions based on 2010 levels \n\n5  Government of the Marshall Islands.

The facility was approved \nto cover supporting infrastructure, including required power sector infrastructure to maintain grid \noperation.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  transmission  and  distribution  assets,  diesel \ngeneration  rehabilitation  and  upgrades,  and  rehabilitation  of  tank  farm  assets.14  The  project \nqualifies to be approved under the Pacific Renewable Energy Financing Facility because (i) the \nproject\u2019s scope includes renewable energy generation and supporting energy sector infrastructure \n(para. 14), (ii) the Marshall Islands is one of the 11 eligible Pacific developing member countries, \n(iii) the project is identified in national energy sector planning documents as a priority investment \n(footnote 10), and (iv) the project has been classified category B for environment.  \n \n14. \nPreservation of, and reinvestment in, MEC\u2019s and Kwajalein Atoll Joint Utilities Resources\u2019 \n(KAJUR)  existing  diesel  generation  assets  will  remain  cost-effective  and necessary  under  any \nrealistic  scenario,  even  if  RMI  achieves  its  renewable  energy  targets:  intermittent  renewable \nenergy resources, irrespective of the extent of installation of capital-intensive battery storage and \nother enabling technologies, cannot cost-effectively form the basis of a reliable power grid in the \nMarshall  Islands  context.    This  can  only  be  provided  by  diesel  generation  in  this  context.  \nIntermittent renewable generation technologies can cost-effectively only complement and partially \ndisplace diesel generation; they cannot replace it.  In fact, dispatch of any amount of intermittent \nrenewable power generation in RMI\u2019s power systems (MEC and KAJUR) is not feasible without \ndiesel generation forming the basis of the power systems to maintain system frequency. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) energy security for the Marshall Islands \nimproved and (ii) safety and environmental risks associated with handling and storage of refined \npetroleum  products  reduced.15  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  safe  and  reliable \noperation  of  the  fuel  tank  farm  sustained  and  supply  of  fuel  to  power  generation  facilities \nthroughout the Marshall Islands continued.16 \n \nC. \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Majuro  tank  farm  rehabilitated.  The  project  will  fund  an  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contract  for  (i)  the  restoration  of  all  fuel  tank  farm  facilities  to \nacceptable condition for sustained operation in compliance with applicable norms and standards \nfor safety, reliability, and environmental protection; and (ii) repair and enhancement of the seawall \nthat protects the MTF from erosion and storm surge (the MTF boundary is within 20 meters of the \nocean side of the atoll). \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Majuro  tank  farm  operation  and  maintenance  program  instituted.

It is used to store fuel for electricity \ngeneration  throughout  the  Marshall  Islands,  as  well  as  for  the  supply  of  the  international  and \ndomestic fishing industry, international and domestic marine transport, and local road transport. \n \n24. \nThe  fuel  tank  farm  facility\u2019s  rehabilitation  is  an  urgent  priority.  Its  dilapidated  condition \npresents multiple risks. Catastrophic failure of its critical components could lead to the facility\u2019s \ninability  to  provide  fuel  handling  and  storage  services.  The  health  and  welfare  of  personnel \nemployed in fuel handling and storage operations are in jeopardy because of the facility\u2019s poor \ncondition, lack of safety equipment, and poor operational practices. The risk of an adverse local \nenvironmental impact if critical component failure leads to large-volume spillage of diesel fuel or \nwaste oil currently stockpiled at the facility is also significant. \n \n25. \nThe fuel tank farm facility is adjacent to the ocean side (south side) of the Majuro lagoon, \nand is protected from erosion and inundation by a sloping rock seawall. The seawall has subsided \nin some  places,  and waves occasionally  overtop  the  seawall  and deposit  debris  in the facility. \nSince  1988,  three recorded  high-water  events  have  inundated  part  of  the site. While  the  bund \naround the fuel storage tanks has not been breached, inundation remains a real risk given the \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nThe project will need to be implemented in stages to allow for uninterrupted operation of \n\nanticipated  sea-level  rise  and  extreme  weather  event  intensification  from  climate  change. \nAccordingly, the project will  include rehabilitation and enhancement of the rock seawall on the \nsouth side of the facility to mitigate against climate change-related risks. \n \nThe rehabilitation and upgrade of the MTF will include the replacement of tank assets and \n26. \nequipment that will be permanently exposed to the elements over their life cycle. The tank farm \nfacility  technical  due  diligence  for  rehabilitation  has  been  conducted  following  the  American \nPetroleum  Institution  standard  653  (API  653),  which  provides  minimum  requirements  for \nmaintaining the integrity of such facilities after they have been placed in service; and addresses \ninspection, repair, alteration, relocation, and reconstruction. Works and goods packages under \nthe project will be based on this and other applicable standards. \n \nThe  project  will  include  advisory  services  for  the  development,  implementation,  and \n27. \nincorporation into MEC\u2019s routine business operations of appropriate arrangements and practices \nfor the O&M of the rehabilitated fuel tank farm facility. This will include training MEC personnel \nand allocating sufficient budget for continuous and adequate O&M program implementation. \n \n28. \nthe MTF facilities, hence the implementation period from 2019 through 2023. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nThe project is found to be economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR)  of  16.9%,  above  the  9.0%  minimum  required  EIRR  for  ADB  investment  projects,  and \neconomic net present value of $10.8 million.  This is due mainly to the substantial benefits arising \nfrom  the  uninterrupted  operation  and  extended  economic  life  of  the  MTF,  which  would  also \nfacilitate continued sale of fuel for power generation, as well as for maritime transport.  Economic \nviability is most sensitive to reductions in benefits, although sensitivity analyses confirm that the \nproject is expected to remain viable across a range of adverse scenarios. \n \n30. \nThe FIRR for the project is 4% and the FNPV, when discounted at the WACC of 1.8%, is \n$2.4  million.  This  demonstrates  that  the  project  is  financially  viable  to  its  owner,  MEC.  \nRefurbishment of the MTF would facilitate the uninterrupted sale of fuel, resulting in large annual \nrevenue streams. Financial viability likewise remains robust across adverse project scenarios. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nADB conducted a financial management assessment for the implementing agency, MEC. \nInherent financial management risk of the project before mitigation was assessed as substantial \nbecause  of  MEC\u2019s  entity-level  risks18.  MEC  has  delegated  the  selection  of  the  project \nimplementation consultants to ADB. Contractors and consultants will be paid directly by ADB. \n \n32. \nTo  address  threats  to  MEC\u2019s  long-term  viability,  the  MOF  and  MEC  have  agreed  to \nimplement reform measures that are being prepared under ADB technical assistance (footnote \n6). These reform measures will be presented to MEC and the government in the second quarter \nof 2019.  In advance of this, the government has assented to four key assurances in the project \nlegal agreements:  \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n18 MEC Financial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis of MEC (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nwithin  1  year  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  government  has  committed  to  transfer \nownership of the MTF to MEC; \nwithin 15 months of grant effectiveness, the government has committed to a reform \nof  MEC\u2019s  corporate  governance  arrangements  such  that  they  conform  to \nOrganization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nCorporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2015); \nthe government  will  provide for  a  tariff  policy  and  rate  structure  that establishes \nMEC\u2019s  authorized  revenue  based  on  verifiable,  prudent  and  reasonable  costs, \nwhile providing MEC an opportunity to recover its costs associated with providing \nelectricity service and incentivizing MEC to control and minimize its costs; and \nthe government will cause MEC to make available adequate budgetary resources \nfor the implementation of a suitable O&M program for the MTF (Output 2 of the \nproject). \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the MOF and MEC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual19. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  will  provide  sustainability  of  critical  economic  infrastructure  in  the  Marshall \n34. \nIslands that is at risk of catastrophic failure.  Such failure would have a severe negative impact \non the Marshall Islands economy, and on the population\u2019s well-being and societal welfare.  This \nproject is an urgent necessity to prevent such failure. \n \n35. \nThe project is classified no gender elements given the limited scope to ensure realistic \nand safe gender mainstreaming in the rehabilitation works. However, the project includes some \nproactive  gender  features  including  (i)  ensuring  women  are  involved  in  operation  and \nmaintenance training and (ii) ensuring the project management unit (PMU) conducts training as \nrequired to increase gender awareness among MEC staff and the contractors. ADB will provide \ntraining  to the  PMU  and project staff  on the  principles outlined in the  multilateral  development \nbanks\u2019 joint statement on combatting sexual exploitation to ensure that the PMU and project staff \nare  able  to  detect,  intercept,  respond  to,  and  prevent  (or  refer)  cases  of  sexual  harassment, \ngender-based violence, and other problems that may emerge during project implementation. In \naddition, the project will indirectly support women through the continued provision of basic energy \nservices  that  provide  specific  benefits  to  women  including  increased  safety,  increased \nopportunities for women\u2019s economic empowerment, and time saved from sourcing alternative fuel \nsources. \n \nE. \n \n36. \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \nEnvironment (category B).
