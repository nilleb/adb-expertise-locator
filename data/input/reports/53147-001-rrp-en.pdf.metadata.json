TTC Energy has already completed and financed \nwith equity the project\u2019s first 11.2 MW.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its capacity as \nthe  mandated  lead  arranger,  has  worked  with  TTC  Energy  to  develop  a  financial  and  project \nstructure  that  has  crowded  in  other  development  finance  institutions  to  provide  longer-tenor \nUnited  States  (US)  dollar  financing,  which  local  lenders  are  unable  to  offer.  In  addition,  the \nproposed PCG has allowed BIDV to become comfortable with providing a local currency tranche \nwith a tenor beyond what it typically offers. The project will be the first and largest independent \npower  producer  solar  rooftop  project  in  the  country  and  will  significantly  increase  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ncommercial and industrial rooftop solar generating capacity by about 11 times, from an estimated \n11.3 MW as of May 2019 to 129.3 MW by project completion, which is expected in 2023.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nElectricity demand in Viet Nam has grown on average by 12% annually from 2005 to 2015 \nand is projected to grow by more than 8.0% through 2030,3 posing a huge challenge to its energy \nsector and National Green Growth Strategy. 4 By 2025, peak demand in Viet Nam is expected to \novertake  Thailand  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  Meeting  this  growing  demand  without \nsignificantly  increasing  the  country\u2019s  contribution  to  global  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  levels  will \nrequire an alternative to the large-scale coal developments that are currently underway. \n \nStrong projected electricity demand growth, declining coal reserves, and limited potential \n4. \nto  develop  further  large-scale  hydropower  plants  led  the  government  in  2018  to  create  a  pilot \nrenewable energy program,5 which increased national solar production from 150 MW to nearly 5 \ngigawatts by June 2019.6 In spite of the success of the pilot program,  Viet Nam faces a threat \nthat demand for power will outpace supply as soon as 2021.7 Rooftop solar offers a quick and \nefficient way for Viet Nam to quickly deploy substantial amounts of additional renewable energy \ncapacity.  Unlike  utility-scale  projects,  which  need  significant  investments  in  grid  infrastructure, \nrooftop  solar  systems  can  be  widely  deployed  without  substantial  upgrades  to  the  distribution \n\n \n\n1  As of January 2020. \n2  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  Vietnam  Low  Emission  Energy  Program.  2019.

The decision established a pilot renewable energy program, setting targets of 800 \nMW for solar energy and an additional 850 MW for wind energy. \n\n6  EVN. 2019.

Ground-mounted solar benefits from a 20-year feed-in tariff of $0.0935 per \nkilowatt-hour.8 Aside from guaranteed revenues from the state-owned offtaker, Vietnam Electricity \n(EVN),  ground-mounted  solar  benefits  from  the  US  dollar-indexation  of  the  tariff,  allowing \ninternational financiers to finance projects in US dollars, which is much cheaper than doing so in \nlocal currency. \n \n6. \nIn contrast, rooftop solar installations do not have a set power purchase agreement with \nEVN, and do not earn revenue in US dollars. This has prevented the market from expanding, as \npotential project developers have to rely on more expensive local currency financing. Potential \ncommercial and industrial customers would typically not be able to use all the electricity generated \nby  their  rooftop  solar  systems  because  of  downtime,  such  as  on  weekends  or  holidays.  This \nunusable surplus power prevents potential customers from entering into take-or-pay contracts. \nThe higher financing costs, combined with the inability to enter into take-or-pay contracts, have \nhistorically prevented the rooftop solar industry from being commercially viable. As such, as of \nJune 2019, the total commercial and industrial solar rooftop segment in Viet Nam was less than \n20 MW, compared with the total solar capacity of more than 4,000 MW for utility-scale solar.9 \n \n7. \nSeeking  to  increase  the  adoption  of  rooftop  solar,  the  Viet  Nam  regulators  eliminated \nlicensing requirements for the installation and operation of solar systems of less than 1 MW.10 In \nearly 2019, the Ministry of Industry and Trade began allowing rooftop solar projects in Viet Nam \nto have two-way meters, which permitted owners of solar rooftop systems to sell unused power \nto the grid, independent of any existing sales agreement, and to receive a feed-in tariff.11 This has \ngreatly improved the economics of rooftop solar and has mitigated a key risk barrier, which had \nhindered Viet Nam\u2019s scaling up of grid-parity rooftop solar power. \n \n8. \nProject  design.  The  project  entails  leasing  of  sub-1  MW  solar  systems  (each  a \nsubproject)  on  the  rooftops  of  commercial  and  industrial  buildings  in  southern  Viet  Nam.  All \nsubprojects  will  adhere  to  the  standardized  financial,  technical,  environmental,  and  social \nframework agreed by TTC Energy and the lenders including ADB, the Netherlands Development \nFinance Company, the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, and BIDV. BIDV \nwill screen all potential customers against an agreed set of financial criteria. Individual subproject \nconstruction will only take place once BIDV has approved the potential lessee on behalf of the \nlenders.  TTC  Energy  will  use  its  equity  to  fully  fund  the  installation  of  each  solar  system  and \nlenders  will  only  disburse  once  each  subproject  has  completed  construction  and  the  lenders\u2019 \ntechnical advisor has confirmed compliance with an agreed technical framework. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED]  Lessees  will  also  be  free  to  enter  into  a \n9. \npower purchase agreement with EVN, which will purchase all surplus electricity generated by the \nsolar rooftop system. \n \n\n \n\n8  Government of Viet Nam. 2017.

Thanh Thanh Cong Investment Joint Stock Company (TTC) is a \n10. \ngroup of private and publicly owned legally independent companies. All of TTC\u2019s companies and \nsubsidiaries are ultimately owned or controlled by Dang Van Thanh\u2019s family. TTC began in 1979 \nas a sugar and molasses company and has grown into a leading Vietnamese conglomerate with \nmore  than  10,000  employees  working  in  four  core  business  sectors:  real  estate,  energy, \nagriculture, and tourism.12 In 1991, Dang Van Thanh, the TTC chairperson, took control of a small \nrural bank, Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Sacombank),13 and turned it into \none of the largest commercial banks in Viet Nam.14 \n \n11. \nTTC is a renewable energy pioneer in Viet Nam. Beginning in 2003, TTC-Bien Hoa Joint \nStock  Company  was  among  the  few  sugar  companies  in  Viet  Nam  to  begin  installing  sugar \nbagasse cogeneration facilities at their sugar plants. Today, TTC-Bien Hoa Join Stock Company \nhas 88.6 MW of total biomass generation capacity. The TTC energy unit, Gia Lai Electricity Joint \nStock Company (GEC), owns and operates 14 small and medium-sized hydropower plants with \ntotal capacity of about 100 MW. In 2017, GEC received an equity injection from Armstrong South \nEast  Asia  Clean  Energy  Fund.  Armstrong  South  East  Asia  Clean  Energy  Fund  and  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  are  now  the  second  and  third  largest  shareholders  of  GEC, \nafter the Dang family. GEC is listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. \n \n12. \nFollowing the release of feed-in tariffs for wind and solar power, TTC identified wind and \nsolar power as its most important investment priority and future growth driver. In late 2018, TTC \n(through GEC) completed and connected to the national grid the first large-scale solar projects \nunder  Vietnam\u2019s  renewable  pilot  program  in  Thua  Thien-Hue  province  (35  MW)  and  Gia  Lai \nprovince (69 MW). Under separate joint ventures, GEC, as the majority shareholder, worked with \nGulf Energy (Thailand) to develop two additional solar farm projects (69 MW and 50 MW), which \nwere completed in mid-2019. The TTC group is the largest and most experienced private sector \noperator of renewable energy in Viet Nam. \n \nTTC Energy, the borrower, was established in 2017 as a subsidiary to spearhead TTC\u2019s \n13. \nefforts in the solar rooftop business. TTC Energy targets commercial and industrial buildings as \npotential  clients  because  of  their  large  usable  rooftop  space  and  strong  incentives  to  reduce \nelectricity costs, as their cost per kilowatt-hour is in the highest grid electricity price brackets. As \nof January 2020, TTC Energy had completed nearly 50 rooftop solar installations totaling 11.2 \nMW,15 and was responsible for more than 60% of the total solar rooftop capacity in Viet Nam. All \nof TTC Energy\u2019s existing rooftop projects use Sharp panels. \n \nADB conducted integrity due diligence.16 TTC Energy, its shareholders, and its executives \n14. \nand  management,  as  well  as  its  significant  contracting  entities,  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a \nsignificant  or  potentially  significant  integrity  risk  as  there  are  no  unresolved  or  substantiated \nadverse  media  or  relevant  information  related  to  them.  Tax  integrity  due  diligence  was  not \nrequired. \n \n\n \n\n12 About 40% of TTC\u2019s employees are women. \n13 In  2008,  ADB  provided  a  $25  million  loan  to  Sacombank.  ADB.

The Revised National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020 aims to prioritize \nthe  development  of  renewable energy  sources  for  power  production  and  increase  solar  power \ncapacity to 850 MW by 2020, about 4,000 MW by 2025, and 12,000 MW by 2030. 17 The project \nis aligned with the following impacts: the contribution of solar energy increased, GHG emissions \nlowered, and Viet Nam\u2019s power supply diversified. The successful implementation of the project \nwill demonstrate how to implement rooftop solar at scale in Viet Nam. This project structure can \nbe replicated across ADB member countries. \n \n16. \nOutcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  supply  of  clean  power  to  the \ncommercial  and  industrial  sectors  increased.  It  will  generate  about  123,000  MW-hours  of \nelectricity per year and reduce about 107,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per \nyear.18 \n \n17. \nOutputs.  The  outputs  of  the  project  will  be  as  follows:  (i)  total  installed  rooftop  solar \ncapacity  increased  to  118  MW  with  a  marketing  strategy  focused  on  promoting  TTC  Energy\u2019s \nproducts  and  services  to  women  developed  and  executed;  (ii)  at  least  150  permanent  jobs \ncreated; (iii) gender inclusiveness of TTC Energy improved through employment targets, internal \npolicies and training; and (iv) local economy supported through domestic purchases of at least $2 \nmillion per annum.  \n \nC. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  private \nsector participation in infrastructure, a core pillar of ADB\u2019s long-term strategy as affirmed by its \nStrategy 2030.19 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, \n2016\u20132020 in supporting the expansion of infrastructure and environment-friendly technologies \nfor clean energy generation.20 It also contributes to the objectives of Viet Nam\u2019s Revised National \nPower Development Plan, 2011\u20132020.21 \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  aligns \n19. \nwith ADB\u2019s energy policy, which encourages interventions designed to shift reliance on fossil fuel \nsources for energy to renewable forms of energy to slow down the growth of GHG emissions and \nhelp  countries  achieve  energy  self-sufficiency. 22 The  project  will  increase  Viet  Nam\u2019s  use  of \nrenewable  energy  and  reduce  reliance  on  fossil  fuels  such  as  coal,  thereby  mitigating  GHG \nemissions.  It  is  also  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  commitments  to  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing $80.0 billion in \nclimate finance by 2030.23 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n17 Government of Viet Nam. 2016.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nTTC  Energy  will  be  responsible  for  finding  qualified  customers,  and \ninstalling and maintaining their solar rooftop systems. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \nThe lessee only pays TTC Energy for actual electricity consumed. TTC \nEnergy remotely reads the meter each month and sends an invoice to \nthe lessee. The lessee will also enter into a power purchase agreement \nwith  Vietnam  Electricity,  which  will  purchase  all  surplus  power. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] While the diversification \nof revenue is a benefit, success of the project is not dependent upon \nthe sale of surplus electricity. \nTTC  Energy  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \nsolar systems. It is able to remotely monitor the expected  and  actual \nperformance  of  every \nits  control  room. \ninstalled  system \nUnderperforming  systems  are  inspected  by  TTC  Energy\u2019s  technical \nteam, while all other systems are inspected once a quarter. \nThe  borrower  will  report  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on  key \nperformance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, and \nsubmit  (i)  semiannual  unaudited  and  annual  audited \nfinancial \nstatements,  (ii)  annual  environmental  and  social  monitoring  reports, \nand (iii) an annual development effectiveness report. \n\nfrom \n\nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n \n24. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\n25 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  will  have  two  components:  (i)  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $4.95 \n25. \nmillion and (ii) a PCG covering a principal amount of the dong equivalent of up to $5.4 million to \nBIDV plus interest thereon. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n \n26. \nCatalytic  impact.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  first  nonrecourse  financing  of  a  rooftop  solar \nprogram  in  Viet  Nam  has  the  potential  to  be  paradigm  shifting.  Viet  Nam  urgently  needs  new \npower generation to address growing demand, and rooftop solar offers a quick solution, with little \nor  no  cost  to  EVN.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  would  provide  a  considerable \ndemonstration effect to the private sector regarding the viability of rooftop solar for the commercial \nand industrial market segments. \n \n27. \nImproving  commercial  viability  and  compliance.  ADB\u2019s  PCG  is  essential  for  BIDV\u2019s \nparticipation in the project. Lending from BIDV and Netherlands Development Finance Company \nin local currency significantly mitigates the foreign exchange risk, which is often a difficult or cost-\nprohibitive barrier for most private sector projects in Viet Nam. ADB is also able to offer the longer-\ntenor debt that infrastructure projects typically require, improving the commercial viability of the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  participation  also  promotes  stringent  governance,  and  extensive  environmental \nand social due diligence. \n \n28.  Mobilization  of  financing.  As  the  mandate  lead  arranger,  ADB  is  responsible  for \nstructuring the debt and arranging the finance. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n29. \nDemonstration  of  a  scalable  model  for  private  sector  financing  of  distributed \nrenewable  energy  projects.  Rooftop  solar  programs  are  typically  more  difficult  to  implement \nthan ground-mounted solar. It is difficult to find the correct balance in establishing a standardized \nfinancial and technical framework that ensures a creditworthy portfolio of subprojects, yet does \nnot inhibit the growth and competitiveness of the project sponsor. If this project is successfully \nimplemented, it will be replicable and scalable not only in Viet Nam, but in other ADB member \ncountries. \n \nC. \n \n30. \n \n31. \n \n32. \n \n33. \n \n\n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n34. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  C),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).26 \n \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n35. \nimpacts  of the  project  and  the measures to avoid, minimize,  mitigate,  and compensate  for  the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  TTC  Energy  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n36. \nThe solar installations, which will be located on the rooftops of existing commercial and \nindustrial buildings, are considered to have minimal potential environmental impacts. Since the \nsolar panels will be located on the rooftops of buildings in commercial and industrial areas, it is \nconfirmed  that  there  will  be  no  need  to  acquire  land  and  no  potential  adverse  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  land.  In  addition,  TTC  Energy\u2019s  environment,  health,  and  safety  plan  has \nbeen  reviewed  and  will  be  enhanced  to  be  consistent  with  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations, as well as with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. Effective measures \nto avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential adverse impacts will be incorporated in the environment, \nhealth,  and  safety  plan of  the  borrower.  The  borrower  will  monitor  and  report their  compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant national laws, standards, and guidelines in \nthe annual environmental and social performance reports. \n \n37. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998),  TTC  Energy  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment  in  its  business  activities.  Key  features  of  the  gender  action  plan  include:  (i)  a \nmarketing  strategy  focused  on  promoting  TTC  Energy\u2019s  products  and  services  to  women \ndeveloped and executed; (ii) an anti-sexual harassment policy developed and implemented; (iii) \na female employee retention and promotion policy developed and implemented on recruitment, \ncompensation,  opportunities  for  growth,  and  promotion;  (iv)  an  increase in  female  employees, \nparticularly  in  technical  or  engineering  capacities;  and  (v)  a  new  internship  or  apprenticeship \nprogram for women in engineering. TTC Energy will submit periodic reports on the implementation \nof gender measures to ADB. \n \n38. \nTTC Energy will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.27 TTC Energy will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \nsuch  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected \npeople will follow ADB requirements.28 \n \nB. \n \n39. \nTTC  Energy  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.
