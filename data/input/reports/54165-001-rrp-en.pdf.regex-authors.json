I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed debt \nfinancing facility of up to $50,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent by subscribing to senior secured \nunlisted non-convertible debentures (NCDs) being issued by ReNew Power Private Limited \n(RPPL) for the ReNew Power COVID-19 Liquidity Support Project (Project) in India. \n \n2.  RPPL is the largest independent renewable energy company in India, and will use the \nfacility to partially finance its working capital needs arising out of cashflow mismatches that may \noccur as a result of delayed payments from its customers because of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. RPPL is anticipating such delays from its main customers\u2014India\u2019s state \npower distribution companies (DISCOMs)\u2014as a result of the lockdown (announced by the \nGovernment of India on 24 March 2020) to contain the spread of COVID-19, and the resulting \nsubdued economic activity. The lockdown and reduced economic activity have also led to a \ntemporary decline in power demand. Industries and commercial establishments are normally \nprofitable DISCOM customers but have substantially reduced their power consumption, which is \nnegatively impacting DISCOM cash flows.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. India is the world\u2019s third-largest electricity producer after the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the United States,1 with an installed capacity of 370.1 gigawatts \n(GW) as of March 2020.2 India\u2019s electricity generation capacity increased by 213 GW during \n2010\u20132019. Although thermal power accounts for 62.3% of installed capacity, renewable energy \nhas been a key driver of growth. India ranks fifth in installed renewable energy capacity globally,3 \nand added 71 GW of renewable power generation capacity during 2010\u20132019. Despite these \nachievements in increasing installed capacity, India\u2019s average per capita energy consumption of \n1,181 kilowatt-hours in FY2019 was estimated to be one-third of the global average. India\u2019s \nrenewable energy installed generation capacity is expected to increase to 450 GW by 2030,4 \nequal to 40% of total generation capacity.5 India has a shorter-term interim target of adding 175 \nGW of renewable installed capacity by FY2022, including 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind \nenergy capacity.6  \n \n4.  (Confidential information redacted.) \n \n5.  While India is making progress towards meeting its development goals, gender disparities \nare prevalent across all sectors, including a decline in women\u2019s labor force participation and an \nincrease in crimes against women.7 The health and economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 \npandemic is further widening these gender-based disparities, with economic impacts falling \ndisproportionately on women and girls, who generally earn less, save less, and hold insecure jobs \n \n1  Enerdata. 2019.

The health of women generally is adversely impacted by the \nreallocation of resources and priorities, including away from sexual and reproductive health \nservices. Unpaid care work has increased, as children are out of school, older persons have \nheightened  care  needs,  and  health  services  are  overwhelmed.  Gender-based  violence  is \nincreasing exponentially with restricted movement and social isolation measures.8  \n \n6.  (Confidential information redacted.) \n \n7.  Project design. A majority of RPPL\u2019s operational portfolio (77.8%) consists of long-term \nPPAs with various DISCOMs, which have weak to moderate financial risk profiles. The lower \npower demand resulting from the COVID-19 lockdown is expected to extend receivable days for \nindependent power producers. The direct impact of an increase in the working capital cycle \nincludes (i) an increase in working capital liquidity required to be provided by RPPL to its \nsubsidiaries and affiliates, and (ii) a reduction in the dividend income from subsidiaries and \naffiliates to RPPL as a result of reduced cash available because of delays in receipt of revenue.  \nRPPL proposes to mitigate this impact by (i) postponing planned capacity expansion by delaying \nconstruction of some projects by a few months, (ii) borrowing a short-term liquidity facility of $50 \nmillion from ADB, and (iii) utilizing part of its existing cash balance. The proceeds from the \nproposed debt financing facility will be used by RPPL to fund its working capital requirements. \nRPPL will infuse liquidity into its operating special purpose vehicles by way of shareholder loans \nthat will enable the special purpose vehicles to sustain business operations even with reduced \ncash flows. \n \n8.  Borrower. RPPL is India\u2019s largest independent renewable power company by operational \ncapacity. It was incorporated in 2011 and commenced operations in 2012 with a 25.2 megawatt \n(MW) wind power project located in Gujarat, India. As of 31 March 2020, RPPL had 5.49 GW of \noperational wind and solar power capacity across nine states in India. (Confidential information \nredacted.) The projects owned and under implementation by RPPL are backed by PPAs with \ncentral or state government off-takers, with predefined tariffs; 92.2% of RPPL's operating assets \nare held by fully or majority-owned subsidiaries, except for six projects with a combined capacity \nof 492.3 MW that are held directly by RPPL.9  \n \n9.  Capacity growth. RPPL\u2019s operational capacity has increased at a compound annual \ngrowth rate of 85% from FY2012 (25.2 MW capacity) to FY2020 (5.49 GW capacity) through \ninternal growth and acquisitions. RPPL acquired KCT Renewable Energy Pvt. Ltd. and its portfolio \nof 103.10 MW of wind energy projects in November 2017, and Ostro Energy Private Limited and \nits portfolio of 1,108.10 MW of wind and solar energy projects in March 2018. As of 31 March \n2020, the operational capacity of RPPL consists of wind power capacity of 3.25 GW, utility-scale \nsolar power capacity of 2.10 GW, and rooftop solar capacity of 144 MW. \n \n10.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impact. The project will have the following impacts: adverse social and economic impact \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic reduced. This is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s COVID-19 \nResponse Stimulus Package,12 which aims to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on \neconomic  activity  in  India,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Comprehensive  Response  to  the  COVID-19 \nPandemic.13 \n \n14.  Outcome. The outcome of the project is continuity of renewable power delivery to the \ndomestic grid ensured. \n \n15.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are: (i) continuity of RPPL operations ensured; \n(ii) continuity of salary payments to female and male employees ensured; (iii) gender equality of \nCOVID-19 staff arrangements enhanced; (iv) women\u2019s entrepreneurship opportunities enhanced \nand; (v) gender equality of corporate social responsibility program enhanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project, through its support \nfor sustaining renewable energy operations, is consistent with following operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) priority 3: tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability; and (iii) priority 4: making cities more livable.14 The project will help enhance \nRPPL\u2019s gender inclusiveness. The project qualifies for climate mitigation as it supports the \noperations of renewable energy projects, which is an eligible activity under the multilateral \ndevelopment banks\u2019 climate finance tracking methodology.15 However, there can be no direct \nemission reduction effect that can be attributed to the project as the renewable energy generation \nby RPPL does not increase as a result of the investment. Ensuring the supply of electricity will \nenable economic activity across the country and enhance the resilience of Indian cities to sustain \nand support an effective response to the pandemic and limit its negative externalities. The project \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, specifically with \npillar 2 (providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and services by improving the \ninfrastructure bottlenecks in lagging regions).16 \n \n17.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith  ADB\u2019s  $20  billion  response  package  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (announced  on \n13 April 2020). 17  As  part  of  this  emergency  package,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \n \n11 ADB. 2016.

The proposed project is \nin line with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024,18 as well as ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Policy,19 as it supports the operations of India\u2019s largest renewable energy company. \n \n18.  Lessons from previous operations. This is ADB\u2019s second transaction with RPPL and \nfifth transaction with the RPPL group. The previous projects improved ADB\u2019s understanding of \nthe renewable sector in India and the challenges faced by developers in the sector.  The key \nchallenges facing the renewable sector in India are construction delays resulting from delays in \nland acquisition and delays in receipt of payments from DISCOMs. These challenges can be \nmitigated by acquiring most of the land required for the project before starting construction of the \nproject and having an adequate liquidity buffer so that the developer can provide any short-term \nliquidity support needed to its projects. The proposed project design acknowledges lessons from \nprevious projects in the renewable sector and will provide RPPL with short-term liquidity that \nwould be used to address any temporary funding needs of its operational projects resulting from \ndelays in receipt of payments from off-takers. \n \nD.

The Government of India\u2019s MNRE promotes renewable energy; it is assisted \nby the Solar Energy Corporation of India, a government enterprise under MNRE\u2019s \ncontrol, in implementing and facilitating schemes for solar, wind and solar\u2013wind hybrid \nprojects. \nManagement  RPPL has a strong management team headed by Sumant Sinha, who has extensive \nexperience across operational and strategic focus areas. The key employees in the \nmanagement team have been with RPPL since its inception and have a proven \nperformance  record.  RPPL  has  a  well-developed  organizational  structure,  which \nincludes experienced mid-level and field-level personnel and a significant number of \nqualified technical personnel.

RPPL works with \nreputed wind OEM providers for O&M services and largely undertakes O&M services \nrequired for solar energy projects in-house. It has a strong in-house O&M team of more \nthan 200 employees.  \nWorking capital  Renewable  energy  is  a  working  capital-intensive  business  as  a  result  of  long \narrangements  receivables periods, especially because of delays in receiving payments from off-takers \nwith weaker credit profiles. The project finance lenders at the operational subsidiaries \nallow the projects to borrow working capital for receivables periods of 3\u20136 months. \n(Confidential information redacted.) \nPerformance monitoring  RPPL will report key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = engineering, procurement, and construction, MNRE = Ministry of New and \nRenewable Energy, O&M = operation and maintenance, OEM = other equipment manufacturers, PPA = power \npurchase agreements, RPPL = ReNew Power Private Limited.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and ReNew Power Private Limited. \n \nF.

ADB will provide up to $50 million in Indian rupee equivalent by subscribing to senior \nsecured unlisted NCDs issued by RPPL. These NCDs would be redeemed 2 years after the \nsubscription date.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  ADB financing is critical to minimize business disruptions resulting from COVID-19. This \nwill enable RPPL, which is an essential services business, to continue its operations and deliver \na reliable supply of power to the domestic grid during the crisis. The project complements the \ngovernment\u2019s $11.9 billion financial package to provide liquidity to DISCOMs to enable them to \npartly clear their payment obligations, which had been building up even prior to the COVID-19 \ncrisis.21 ADB support would address short-term liquidity constraints at a time of crisis when local \ncommercial banks have become risk averse and have reduced lending activity.22 ADB\u2019s existing \nrelationships have enabled it to build a strong relationship with RPPL, which in combination with \nthe proposed debt financing facility will facilitate an enhancement of gender inclusiveness of \nRPPL, even during this crisis. \n \n \n \n21 The liquidity would be infused (in two equal tranches) through Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural \nElectrification Corporation (REC). Consequently, REC and PFC will extend special long-term transition loans up to \n10 years to DISCOMs. Loans will be provided to the DISCOMs against guarantees by the respective state \ngovernments. \n22 The amount of cash deposited by banks with the Reserve Bank of India increased from $30.95 billion on 20 March \n2020 to $83.78 billion on 29 May 2020 despite two rate cuts (totaling 115 basis points in aggregate) by RBI during \nthis period.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n30.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C).23 Proceeds of the ADB investment would not be used to finance \nconstruction or any project development activities.  RPPL has established an Environmental and \nSocial Management System (ESMS) that is aligned with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement.24 \nThe ESMS defines the procedures and institutional arrangements at the corporate and project \nlevel for managing the environmental and social risks associated with RPPL\u2019s solar and wind \nproject operations. In line with ESMS requirements, RPPL has also established a corporate \nenvironment and social team with qualified and dedicated personnel to manage environmental \nand social operations in coordination with subproject-level environment and social staff.  \n \n31.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. ADB\u2019s due diligence focused on the seven \nsubprojects funded by ADB against the requirements of the ESMS. The annual environmental \nand social monitoring reports and supervision records were reviewed, and consultations were \nheld with RPPL\u2019s environment and social team to understand the status and management of \nsample subprojects under normal and current COVID-19 scenarios. These reviews confirmed the \nadequacy of the ESMS in managing and mitigating environmental and social impacts in line with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The review also validated the implementation \nof the ESMS across subprojects throughout the project cycle processes. The environmental and \nsocial measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of RPPL to manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. RPPL has committed to conducting an \nindependent portfolio audit (based on a review of sample projects) to confirm the effective \nimplementation of the ESMS. RPPL will implement time-bound corrective action plans in the event \nof any identified gaps. ADB will continue to monitor RPPL\u2019s environmental and social progress \nand performance on an ongoing basis.  \n \n32.  Effective gender mainstreaming.

Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i)  RPPL \nwill communicate each month with employees about the COVID-19 situation and government or \ncivil society services that staff can access, including on domestic violence and mental health; \n(ii) RPPL will support at least eight women\u2019s self-help groups to start facemask production \nenterprises with training, mentoring, in-kind donations and marketing support; (iii) dry ration food \npackets will be donated by RPPL to at least 10,000 women and their families living near the \ncompany\u2019s project sites; (iv) at least \u20b92.5 million worth of personal protective equipment or other \nmedical equipment will be donated by RPPL to local hospitals or clinics; and (v) RPPL will \ncontinue to maintain the employment of all of its female staff on full salary. RPPL will submit \nperiodic reports on its implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n33.  RPPL will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list; (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations, and comply with national labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001); (iii) take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards;25 and \n(iv) commit to undertake the recommended improvements in the implementation of  its ESMS. \nInformation  disclosure  and  consultation  as  applicable  will  be  conducted  following  ADB \nrequirements. RPPL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the \nmeasures taken. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  RPPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n35.  The proposed NCDs are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n36.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to RPPL.
