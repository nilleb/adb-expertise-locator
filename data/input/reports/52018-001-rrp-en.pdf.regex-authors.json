THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Palau for the Disaster Resilience Program.1 \n \n2.  Palau is at high risk from natural hazards. It is taking important steps to improve disaster \nand climate risk management\u2014to reduce risks from, better plan for, respond to, and recover from \ndisasters. The proposed program will provide the Government of Palau with rapid access to \nfinancing if a significant disaster caused by any type of natural hazard affects the country.2 A \nsingle-tranche, stand-alone, policy-based loan (PBL) from the regular ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is proposed to provide Palau with a source of contingent \nfinancing for immediate disaster response, early recovery, and reconstruction.3 To establish \neligibility to access the contingent financing, the government has undertaken policy actions that \n(i) strengthen policies and institutions for disaster and climate resilience, (ii) improve capacity and \nplanning for disaster and climate risk management, and (iii) expand financing for disaster and \nclimate risk management. The actual withdrawal of funds will be deferred until the President of \nPalau declares a state of emergency because a disaster caused by a natural hazard has occurred. \nProgram monitoring will ensure continued progress toward the overall goals. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Development  context.  Palau  consists  of  about  370  islands  covering  466  square \nkilometers and has a population of around 21,500 (2016). Palau\u2019s free association with the United \nStates has contributed to its relative affluence\u2014its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of \n$17,096 (FY2017) is one of the highest in the Pacific. However, Palau depends heavily on grants, \nwhich accounted for 18.5% of GDP and 43.7% of total revenue during FY2011\u2013FY2017.4 The \n \neconomy is narrowly based, and tourism receipts generally contribute 45%\u201355% of annual GDP.\n \n4.  Palau experiences frequent natural hazards (mainly typhoons, droughts, and tidal surges), \nwhich can result in human casualties, disrupt economic activity, lead to loss of livelihoods, divert \nfiscal resources, and undermine development priorities. Although not all disasters are caused by \nclimate change, the country\u2019s vulnerability to climate change will heighten disaster risks because \nextreme weather events are likely to increase in the future.5 Analysis undertaken under the Pacific \nCatastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative indicates that Palau faces an average \nannual loss of $2.7 million from typhoons, earthquakes, and tsunamis, with probable maximum \nlosses of $16.8 million from a 1-in-50-year event, $46.7 million from a 1-in-100-year event, and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Financial impacts. Palau has suffered three major disasters caused by natural hazards \nsince  2012,  leading  to  significant  financial  stress.  In  2012,  Typhoon  Bopha  caused  about \n$5.9 million in initial damages (2.7% of GDP), but the final damage estimate was raised to \n$15 million\u2013$20 million (7.0%\u20139.3% of GDP).7 In 2013, initial damage from Typhoon Haiyan was \nassessed to be $6.3 million (2.8% of GDP), with the final damage estimated at $9.7 million (4.3% \nof GDP).8 In 2016, severe drought associated with El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions led to water \nshortages across Palau, and generated significant sanitation and hygiene risks. Government \nestimates placed financing needs at $3.2 million (1.1% of GDP) in FY2016, mainly for water \nacquisition and distribution. Drought conditions persisted into 2017, leading to continued water \nrationing. The  drought also  led  to  the  closure  of  Jellyfish  Lake,  a major  tourist  attraction. \nConsequently, real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen to \u20133.7% in FY2017 as tourist arrivals \ndeclined. Tourism receipts fell from a peak of $138.9 million in FY2015 to $115.7 million in FY2017. \n \n6.  Key constraints. Insufficient fiscal resources constrained disaster response, recovery, \nand reconstruction.9 In the absence of dedicated resources to finance post-disaster needs, the \ngovernment relied largely on budget reallocations, which redirected funds away from development \npriorities and fell short of the initially assessed damages. Short-term post-typhoon needs were \nfinanced by emergency appropriations from internal revenue, authorized through legislation \napproved by the President. The government authorized $10 million but appropriated $5 million \nunder  the  Super  Typhoon  Bopha  Emergency  Funding  Act  in  2012,  financed  from  internal \nrevenue.10 Almost $1.5 million was appropriated under the Super Typhoon Haiyan Emergency \nFunding Act in 2013, also financed from internal revenue.11 The government appropriated $2 \nmillion in emergency funding for severe drought relief under the Extreme Drought Emergency \nFunding Act in 2016, of which about $1.65 million was drawn from the General Fund Reserve \n(GFR) (para. 15).12 Palau received support from development partners following the typhoons,13 \nand longer-term reconstruction activities were also funded under the government budget. \n \n7.  Inadequate community-based planning and preparedness (including coping mechanisms, \npublic awareness, and emergency response capacity) affected disaster response and recovery \n(footnotes 7 and 8). Weaknesses in institutional arrangements and donor coordination14 also \nexacerbated the indirect economic and social costs of disasters. \n \n8.  Fiscal situation. Despite these development challenges, Palau has largely maintained \nmacroeconomic  stability.  External  public  debt,  estimated  at  34.2%  of  GDP  in  FY2017,  is \nsustainable over the medium term as the government pursues fiscal consolidation measures \n                                                \n6  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative.  2011.

However, the debt situation remains highly sensitive to real GDP growth shocks, \nsuch as those that Palau could experience if affected by a major disaster. The International \nMonetary Fund recommends that Palau boost its resilience to disasters and climate change.15 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n9.  Government vision. The Government of Palau is committed to managing disaster risks. \nThe National Disaster and Risk Management Framework 2010 (NDRMF)16 sets out a vision of \n\u201csafe, resilient and prepared communities in Palau.\u201d The key objectives of the NDRMF are to \n(i) establish  organizational  arrangements  that  maximize  the  use  of  available  resources  to \nstrengthen mitigation, preparedness, response, and relief and recovery planning for natural \nhazards; (ii) promote integrated planning and collaboration for disaster risk management (DRM) \nacross all levels of government, departments, sectors, and communities; and (iii) integrate climate \nchange adaptation and disaster management into national and sectoral planning and strategy. \nThe NDRMF draws special attention to women in livelihood recovery and to strengthening DRM \nfor local communities. \n \n10.  The NDRMF outlines the institutional arrangements for its implementation. The highest \nauthority is the Disaster Executive Council, which is convened and chaired by the President of \nPalau, with all ministers as members. The second tier is the National Emergency Committee \n(NEC), convened by the vice president, comprising 28 members from various ministries, bureaus, \ndivisions, and agencies. The NEC provides oversight, coordination, and guidance on DRM \nactivities. The National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) acts as the secretariat for the \nNEC, and is involved in all aspects of NDRMF implementation. \n \n11.  In 2015, the government adopted the Palau Climate Change Policy for Climate and \nDisaster Resilient Low Emissions Development 2015 (PCCP) to lay out its overarching vision.17 \nThe PCCP objectives reiterate and expand on those in the NDRMF. Its main objective is to build \nthe resilience of Palau to climate change and disasters. Additional objectives are to (i) enhance \nadaptation and resilience to the expected impacts of global climate change across sectors; \n(ii) improve Palau\u2019s ability to manage unexpected disasters and minimize disaster risk; and \n(iii) mitigate  global  climate  change  by  working  toward  low-carbon  emission  development, \nmaximizing energy efficiency, protecting carbon sinks, and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe PCCP advocates a proactive approach to community-level DRM, to build knowledge and \nunderstanding of the hazards and risks to which communities may be exposed. \n \n12.  The  PCCP  sets  out  an  ambitious  5-year  action  plan  for  implementation.  It  covers \ninterventions across four strategic priorities: (i) climate change adaptation, (ii) DRM, (iii) mitigation \nand  low-emission  development,  and  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  for  effective  policy \nimplementation. It also outlines individual reform actions to be undertaken under the broader \ninterventions. The Office of Climate Change in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) coordinates PCCP \nimplementation and monitoring. \n \n13.  Declaration of emergency. The President of Palau may declare a state of emergency in \nthe event of war, external aggression, civil rebellion, or natural catastrophe threatening the lives \nor property of a significant number of people in Palau, in accordance with Article VIII, Section 14 \n                                                \n15 International Monetary Fund. 2016.

Koror. \n ", "4     \n \nof the Palau Constitution.18 The NDRMF clarifies the declaration procedure in the event of a \ndisaster triggered by a natural catastrophe. The NEC can recommend to the President, through \nthe Disaster Executive Council, to declare a state of emergency in all or part of the affected or \npotentially affected areas. The recommendation is based on reliable information received from a \nverifiable source such as the weather service, an aerial reconnaissance, and/or significant \nemergency impact reports. The declaration has to be confirmed by the Palau National Congress \nwithin 10 days if it is to continue beyond the initial 10-day period.19 In the event of an emergency, \nNEMO coordinates disaster response and recovery, acting under the oversight of the NEC, in all \nor part of the affected or potentially affected areas of Palau. Also, state governors can declare a \nstate of emergency covering only their state. \n \n14.  The President of Palau has declared three states of emergency due to natural hazards \nsince 2012\u2014after Typhoon Bopha in 2012, Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and the drought in 2016 \n(para. 5). In addition, the governor of Koror has twice declared a state of emergency in Koror.20 \n \n15.  Disaster  risk  financing.  Palau  has  no  dedicated financing  available for  immediate \ndisaster response, early recovery, and reconstruction, relying instead on reallocation of internal \nrevenues and drawdown from the permanent GFR. The permanent GFR was established in \nFY2014 following the experience of the two typhoons (para. 5).21 The minimum annual allocation \nfor the GFR is set at 2% of unrestricted local revenue collections from the preceding fiscal year.22 \nUnspent amounts from previous fiscal years accumulate in the GFR, and the Palau National \nCongress can also allocate additional amounts towards it. The available balance in the GFR as \nof June 2018 is $14.4 million.  The GFR may be tapped after a disaster in the absence of \nalternative financing, but is not exclusive for post-disaster financing needs, and may also be \naccessed for other purposes.23  Budget realignment to finance all types of post-disaster needs is \ngenerally undertaken in practice, but is not well-documented in budget laws and papers.  \n \n16.  The government sees a further need to build resources for immediate disaster response, \nearly recovery, and reconstruction instead of relying on (i) budget reallocations from internal \nrevenue which can take time to secure (partly due to government approval procedures), fall short \nof requirements, and redirect funds away from development priorities, and (ii) GFR reserves, \nwhich are not intended exclusively for financing post-disaster needs. The PCCP envisions the \nestablishment of a $25 million disaster contingency fund to respond in times of emergency and \nan $11 million National Disaster Recovery Fund and Insurance Program, neither of which is in \nplace. The government is considering typhoon insurance cover through the Pacific Catastrophe \nRisk Insurance Company for the 2018\u201319 typhoon season, for low-frequency high-impact events.  \n                                                \n18 Government of Palau. 1979.

At this time, \nthe government (through its authorized officials) can engage directly in negotiations with potential companies without \ngoing through regular tendering procedures. All procurement decisions are recorded for review and scrutiny.  \n20 The first state of emergency declared by the Governor of Koror for Koror was in response to Typhoon Bopha in 2012 \nseveral hours before the national state of emergency was declared, and the second followed the end of the national \nstate of emergency in response to the 2016 drought. \n21 As part of the FY2014 budget, the government approved the establishment of a permanent GFR, to create a buffer \nreserve fund to support government operations through periods of shortfall of resources, and thus avoid deficit \nfunding through running up short-term debt as happened subsequent to the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis.   \n22 Appropriations during FY2014\u2013FY2016 fell short of 2% of unrestricted local revenue collections from the preceding \nyear by 15%\u201320% each year, but the FY2017 appropriation was 18% more than 2% of unrestricted local revenue \ncollections from the preceding year. \n23 Until 2024, when US Compact funds are due to expire, the GFR may be drawn down when any state of emergency \nis declared, if other funds are unavailable. The GFR can also be accessed if local revenues drop by more than 5% \nof projected revenues of the previous year. After the expiration of the Compact funding period, the GFR may be \nutilized to fund any lawful purpose. \n ", "5    \n \n \n17.  Ongoing reforms. The government is implementing several reforms across the four \nPCCP priorities (para. 12).

Policy actions included in the proposed program (para. 21) are part of broader \ninterventions presented in the shaded boxes. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.  Several reform actions (contributing to the broader PCCP interventions presented in the \nfigure) are underway, although the pace of progress varies depending on implementation agency \ncapacity and available funding (footnote 9). In 2016, the President endorsed a policy framework \nfor responsible tourism that integrates climate resilience into tourism development and adds a \nfocus on eco-tourism in outer islands to ease the pressure of tourism in Koror.24 Proposals are \nunder consideration to provide tax relief to hotels that invest in water catchment plants (to help \nensure water supply for tourists during droughts) and install solar panels to promote renewable \nenergy for tourism. To enhance mitigation, funding to improve the energy efficiency of housing \nand transport is being sought, and energy-efficient building codes are under development. \nSupport in the amount of $1.2 million was allocated to integrate climate change actions into \nexisting Protected Areas Network (PAN) frameworks and management plans.25 \n                                                \n24 Government of Palau, Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism, Bureau of Tourism. 2016. \nResponsible Tourism Policy Framework.

Palau has made good progress on reform actions to strengthen community-level planning, \ncapacity,  and  response,  as  envisaged  in  the  PCCP  (para.  11).  NEMO  has  developed  a \ncommunity-based disaster risk reduction toolkit in 2016 to guide communities in responding to \ndisasters. NEMO has also conducted climate change vulnerability assessments in eight states. \nMeasures  to  improve food  security  in  the face  of frequent  droughts include  support for  a \nsustainable piggery and rehabilitation of taro patches (which were damaged during the typhoons). \nEvacuation shelters have been identified in each of Palau\u2019s 16 states to accommodate community \nmembers in times of disasters, and are being disaster-proofed. The government is developing a \ncomprehensive  geographic  information  system database,  which  will  help  identify  structures \nimpacted by wave inundation and sea-level rise, and vulnerable to typhoons and tsunamis, to \nimprove community-level planning and response. Work is underway to identify vulnerable areas, \nso that communities can be relocated to safer locations as needed.26 The government is also \ndeveloping a work program to strengthen equipment and capacity for the rapid and fully functional \ndissemination of early disaster warnings to all affected communities.27 \n \n20.  Proposed program. The PBL is aligned with the following development objective: safety, \nresilience, and preparedness of communities in Palau enhanced (footnote 16). It will provide \nPalau with a source of contingent financing for immediate disaster response, early recovery, and \nreconstruction. To establish eligibility to access the contingent financing, the government has \ncompleted nine policy actions to strengthen disaster and climate risk management. \n \n21.  Reform areas. The nine policy actions are based on the government\u2019s ongoing reforms \nto achieve the PCCP objectives, and were completed between July 2017 to June 2018. 28 They \nwere prioritized in consultation with the government, help advance broader interventions to \nstrengthen climate and disaster-resilient development (as presented in the figure), and indicate \ngovernment commitment to PCCP implementation. The policy actions serve to (i) strengthen \npolicies and institutions for disaster and climate resilience, (ii) improve capacity and planning for \ndisaster and climate risk management, and (iii) expand financing for disaster and climate risk \nmanagement. The actions are outlined below.  \n(i)  Strengthening policies and institutions for disaster and climate resilience. \nThe MOF has approved a midterm review of the PCCP, prepared by the Office of \nClimate Change (para. 12), which includes an update on the implementation of \nadaptation, mitigation, DRM, and institutional strengthening measures since 2015. \nNEMO has finalized a Mass Rescue Operations Contingency Plan that clarifies \ninstitutional roles and responsibilities of government agencies for a coordinated \noperational response in the event of large-scale disasters, which the NEC has \napproved. \n(ii)  Improving capacity and planning for disaster and climate risk management. \nIn order to strengthen community planning and capacity as envisioned in the PCCP, \nNEMO has finalized a community disaster plan template for hamlets that details a \ncommunity\u2019s emergency response organizations and assigns responsibilities for \nvarious tasks in the event of a disaster. NEMO has also completed training \nworkshops on developing the community disaster plan based on the disaster risk \nreduction toolkit (para. 19) in 12 (of 16) states. The Ministry of Education has \n                                                \nto apply for designated PAN funds, which will be used by each PAN site to manage its own resources in accordance \nwith system-wide goals and objectives for conservation and sustainable development. \n26 Melekeok State has developed a plan to relocate its coastal community, which is at risk of floods, to higher ground. \n27 A radio tower that could broadcast in amplitude modulation was destroyed during Typhoon Bopha in 2012 and is still \nawaiting  reconstruction.  Therefore,  for  early  warning,  the  government  has  to  rely  on  frequency  modulation \nbroadcasting systems with a more limited range. \n28 The Policy Matrix is in Appendix 4, and details the nine completed policy actions. \n ", "7    \n \n \napproved updated school emergency management plans for 15 (of 18) public \nschools as guides for the principal, staff, and teachers, who will be responsible for \nensuring the safety of students during emergencies.29 The Ministry of Education \nhas also incorporated climate change and DRM into the public school science \ncurriculum for grades 7\u20138, and provided support to teachers through climate \nscience training based on the new science curriculum framework. In view of \nfrequent droughts and the destruction of crops during the recent typhoons, the \nMinistry of Agriculture has finalized training manuals for horticulture and livestock \nproducers that include climate resilience measures, and approved their rollout for \ntraining. The MOF, through the Office of Palau Automated Land and Resource \nInformation System, has completed geographic information system layers for \nhouseholds, businesses, farms, roads, utilities, and major infrastructure, including \ninformation on construction materials and storey height, which are key in assessing \ndisaster risks and losses (para. 19). \n(iii)  Expanding  financing  for  disaster  and  climate  risk  management.  The \ngovernment has continued efforts to enhance funding from its own resources. For \nFY2018, it has appropriated $1.265 million for the GFR (para. 15), which can be \ntapped in the event of a disaster caused by natural hazards. The government has \nstarted implementing a $100 per person Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee for \ntourists,  replacing  the  $50  per  person  green  fee.  This  fee  will  help  finance \nbiodiversity conservation efforts in marine protected areas and the PAN, including \ncommunity adaptation and DRM priorities in PAN sites (para. 18). \n \n22.  Program monitoring framework. In addition, a program monitoring framework (footnote \n28) identifies how the government plans to broadly continue reforms in the three program reform \nareas through 2021. The PCCP will be updated based on its midterm review, to rationalize reform \nactions. NEMO will secure community endorsement and approval of at least 16 community \ndisaster plans at the hamlet-level based on the new template (para. 21), as well as approval for \n16 state-level Disaster Risk Reduction Action and Evacuation Plans. Suitable school buildings will \nbe identified, and climate/disaster proofed adequately to serve as evacuation shelters. Training \non climate- and disaster-resilient horticulture and livestock farming will be rolled out, based on the \nnew training manuals (para. 21). Palau\u2019s equipment for the rapid, fully functional dissemination of \ndisaster early warnings to all affected communities and the capacity of communities to respond \nappropriately will be strengthened, based on a proposal to improve the typhoon early warning \nsystem that is under preparation. High resolution topographical maps for the main inhabited areas \nof Babeldaob and Koror (covering more than 90% of the population of Palau) will be prepared to \nimprove local planning and response efforts. The government will continue to annually appropriate \nat least 2% of local revenue collections from the preceding fiscal year for the GFR. Disaster \nrecovery planning and post-disaster budget execution capabilities will be further strengthened. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The most cost-effective way of financing disaster response is \nthrough various tools in a common framework to minimize different layers of risk, as no single \ninstrument is optimal for responding to all disaster events, which range from frequent, small-scale \nevents to rare catastrophic events.30 The government recognizes that contingent financing can \nbe effective in minimizing risks from disaster events that would exhaust funds available for \n                                                \n29 The remaining three schools are in the outer islands, and have fewer than 30 students each, and will update their \nplans later in 2018. \n30 Disaster Risk Financing Tools and Approaches (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) presents \ndetails on existing ADB instruments and different options available to Palau to address different layers of risks arising \nfrom disasters caused by natural hazards.  \n ", "8     \n \nimmediate response, early recovery, and reconstruction under the GFR, but are too frequent to \nbe covered cost-effectively through insurance. The PBL will address this critical financing gap. \nAmong ADB\u2019s existing instruments to respond to post-disaster financing needs, emergency \nassistance loans can take more than 3 months to process, while reconstruction loans under \nnormal lending modalities can take even longer.31 The PBL will enable financing to be in place \nbefore a disaster, and provide Palau with immediate access to resources for timely response, \nearly recovery, and reconstruction in the event of a qualifying disaster. ADB will also add value \nthrough technical assistance (TA) under the program monitoring framework. \n \n24.  Proposed technical assistance. The PBL marks ADB\u2019s initial engagement on DRM and \nclimate change reforms in Palau, and will pave the way for more systematic interventions. The \nprogram monitoring framework (para. 22) will serve as the basis for ADB\u2019s continued engagement \nwith Palau to support longer-term reforms.32 Based on the availability of resources, ADB\u2014in \nconsultation  with  the  government  and  other  partners\u2014will  explore  the  provision  of  TA  to \n(i) strengthen  disaster  recovery  planning  and  post-disaster  budget  execution  capabilities, \nensuring that available post-disaster financing can be used quickly and effectively; (ii) undertake \ndisaster and climate vulnerability and risk assessments of priority critical infrastructure (potentially, \nBelau National Hospital, Meyungs Causeway, and Minato-bashi Bridge);33 and (iii) continue to \nprepare and implement community disaster plans. \n \n25.  ADB experience. ADB has provided significant loans, grants, and TA for post-disaster \nresponse, early recovery, and reconstruction in the Pacific (footnote 30).34 It piloted similar \ncontingent financing in the Cook Islands in 2016 through a stand-alone, single-tranche PBL from \nordinary capital resources to support timely disaster response (footnote 2).35 This approach is \nalso  reflected  in  the  2017  regional  program  for  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Tuvalu,  from  ADB\u2019s \nconcessional resources (footnote 2). Following extensive damage from Cyclone Gita in Tonga in \nFebruary 2018, ADB released $6 million from the regional program within 24 hours of receiving \nthe Government of Tonga\u2019s request, demonstrating the benefits of this approach. The regional \nprogram provides $2 million in TA to further expand ADB engagement in DRM reforms. \n \n26.  Lessons learned. Several lessons from ADB\u2019s support for DRM in the Pacific were \nincorporated in the program: (i) as evidenced in the case of Tonga, the primary benefit of a \ndeferred drawdown is that it is quick disbursing, providing the government with an immediate \nsource of bridge financing after a disaster; (ii) for the government to fully benefit from the quick-\ndisbursing nature of contingent financing, it has been ensured that institutional arrangements are \nin place in Palau to enable the post-disaster submission of a withdrawal request for funds to ADB; \n(iii) since the policy matrix includes reforms across different sectors, dialogue with the various line \nagencies  was  initiated  early  during  program  preparation,  and  continued  through  ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n31 ADB provides dedicated funding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian Development Fund \n12 Disaster Response Facility. Palau is not eligible since it has access to ordinary capital resources. Also, grants of \nup to $3 million per event may be provided for humanitarian relief under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. \n32 Under the program monitoring framework, ADB expects to provide targeted support from regional TA funds. ADB. \n2015. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Climate and Disaster Resilience of Investments in the Pacific. Manila \n(TA 8961-REG). \n33 Meyungs Causeway links the country\u2019s only public hospital, Belau National Hospital on Southwest Islanders Village, \nto Koror Island. The Minato-bashi Bridge carries the main sewage trunk line from Koror to the sanitation plant, and \nalso links several major hotels to Koror and the airport, and is thus particularly important for tourism. All three \nstructures face high disaster risk, according to the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Industries and Commerce. \n34 In 2013, ADB provided Palau with $200,000 from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund after Typhoon Haiyan. \n35 The Government of the Cook Islands undertook reforms to strengthen DRM policies and institutions, improve the \ndisaster resilience of physical assets, and expand disaster risk financing. The program includes provision of TA, \ndepending on government demand. DRM issues are regularly discussed during country consultation missions. \n ", "9    \n \n \nDevelopment Coordination Office in Koror to ensure timely completion of actions; (iv) the PBL \nprovides the opportunity to elevate DRM issues to the MOF level, and the provision of TA to \nsupport the reform areas in the program monitoring framework (para. 24) is expected to facilitate \nsubstantive policy dialogue and effective implementation even if the loan is fully disbursed. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n27.  It will only be possible to quantify the full economic impact of the program after a disaster, \nas the benefits (or costs avoided) will be determined by the scale and nature of the specific event. \nThe PBL will allow the government to finance post-disaster needs in a timely manner, and avoid \nopportunity  costs  associated  with  budget  or  aid  reallocations,  and/or  any  financial  costs \nassociated  with  additional  commercial  or  concessional  borrowing  that  may  be  needed  for \nimmediate response, early recovery, and reconstruction. Direct economic benefits include faster \nrestoration of essential services, facilitation of medical support that can minimize loss of lives, \ncontainment of the emergency situation, and less risk of negative post-disaster health impacts. \n \n28.  In addition, the policy actions to establish eligibility to access the contingent financing will \nimprove Palau\u2019s ability to withstand and cope with the short- and longer-term impacts of disasters \nand climate change. They will encourage reforms that ultimately result in beneficial economic \nimpacts, such as (i) reduced loss of lives and property reflecting improved disaster planning, \nresponse, preparation, and public training; (ii) less destruction of property resulting from better \nmapping and location of critical public infrastructure and assets; and (iii) lower damage to crops \nthrough the adoption of better and more climate-resilient cropping techniques. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n29.  The government has requested a single-tranche, stand-alone loan of $15 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance immediate disaster response, early recovery, \nand reconstruction. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, with \nrepayments calculated based on a disbursement-linked amortization schedule, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. There is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n30.  Post-disaster financing needs are determined based on the likely fiscal impact of medium- \nto high-impact disasters, taking into account the resources likely available from domestic and \ninternational sources, and the need to ensure that Palau maintains a sustainable level of debt \n(footnote 4). As the proposed loan funds are for contingent financing to support additional public \nspending associated with immediate disaster response, early recovery, and reconstruction, the \nloan amount is not directly correlated with the cost of policy reforms. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n31.  The MOF will be the executing agency, responsible for coordinating and monitoring \nprogram implementation. The implementing agencies will include the Ministry of Education; the \nMinistry of Natural Resources, Environment, and Tourism; the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, \nIndustries, and Commerce; and NEMO\u2014which are responsible for reforms presented in the policy \nmatrix, together with MOF. The program period will be from approval to 31 December 2021.  \n \n32.  Eligibility to withdraw from the loan is based on the achievement of the nine policy actions \n(para. 21). Actual withdrawal will be deferred until the occurrence of a disaster triggered by a \n ", "10     \n \nnatural hazard that results in the official declaration of a state of emergency by the President of \nPalau in accordance with Article VIII, Section 14 the 1979 Constitution (para. 13), covering all or \npart of Palau, within the program period.36 The government can withdraw the loan proceeds \npartially or entirely, depending on its assessment of the disaster\u2019s severity and resultant need, \nand after the government and ADB have agreed on the withdrawal amount. Loan proceeds will \nbe withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n33.  A specific repayment schedule based on the size of the drawdown and the remaining \nunutilized funds will be calculated. Funds will be spent through national budget processes. During \nloan effectiveness, ADB will monitor the implementation of reforms according to the program \nmonitoring framework (para. 22). If no state of emergency is declared within the program period, \nloan proceeds will not be withdrawn. If a new disaster resilience program is processed after 2021, \nprogress will be reviewed against the program monitoring framework. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n34.  Governance.  Palau  has  limited financial  arrangements  in  place for  disaster  events \n(para. 15). Moreover, coordinating disaster response, including the support offered by donors and \ncivil society organizations with competing requirements and procedures, can pose significant \nadministrative challenges, and government absorption capacities are often stretched in the \naftermath of disaster events. TA will prioritize capacity development focusing on financing and \nbudgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation and execution, to ensure that Palau \nhas adequate systems in place to use program resources in an effective, accountable, and \ntransparent manner (para. 24). \n \n35.  Poverty and social. The program will allow the government to maintain greater fiscal \nstability in the event of a disaster, and enable it to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimum \ndelay, mitigating the immediate adverse impacts. Implementation of the policy actions will further \nensure that communities, including vulnerable households, are able to better plan and prepare \nfor disasters. Training for households on the community-based disaster risk reduction toolkit (para. \n21) involves community consultations and outreach. \n \n36.  The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The midterm review of the \nPCCP  includes  an  update  on  reforms  benefiting  women.  The  Mass  Rescue  Operations \nContingency Plan includes sex-disaggregated tracking of evacuees and identification of their \nspecial needs. In 2016, NEMO finalized a community-based disaster risk reduction toolkit (para. \n19), which (i) prioritizes women and other vulnerable groups for community-level DRM, (ii) \nrecognizes the importance of partnerships with women\u2019s groups for effective DRM, and (iii) \nrecommends the inclusion of the leader of the traditional women\u2019s group in the hamlet emergency \ncommittee. The community disaster plan template is based on this toolkit, and training workshops \non the toolkit were completed by NEMO in 12 (of 16 states). Of the 182 community members who \nwere trained, 79 were women (against a target of 40%). The horticulture and livestock training \nmanuals and the training to be rolled out will benefit women, who make up more than 75% of \nfarmers in Palau.37 The school emergency management plans include guidance on how students \n(disaggregated by gender) will be accounted for, through student emergency cards that also \ninclude  consideration  for  special  needs.  The  revised  science  curriculum  for  grades  7\u20138 \nincorporates the special role of women in times of disaster response. \n                                                \n36 States of emergency declared by governors in their particular states will not qualify for withdrawal of loan proceeds.  \n37 Government of Palau. 2015. 2015 Census of Population, Housing and Agriculture of the Republic of Palau. Koror. \n ", "11    \n \n \n37.  Safeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the PBL has \nbeen screened and is classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples. Environmental and social impacts of policy actions were evaluated. Program \nactivities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and no policy action will result in or lead \nto involuntary resettlement or have adverse impacts on indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n38.   Risks and mitigation. Key risks to program implementation relate to possible external \nshocks and capacity constraints of the government agencies, including constraints in public \nfinancial management systems. MOF has experience in executing donor-financed (including \nADB-financed) projects (footnote 14), and financial management systems for externally financed \nprojects are considered adequate (footnote 9). The remaining fiduciary risks will be managed \nthrough TA support for capacity development of government counterparts (para. 24). Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in the table below and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.38 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOF. \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures Risks Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nRepeated or major external shocks  Development partners help the government build buffers to improve \n(e.g., disasters or economic downturns)  resilience, and provide assistance in case of economic shocks. \nhurt the economy.

ASSURANCES \n \n39.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement. No disbursements of loan proceeds will be made unless the \nPresident of Palau has declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d in accordance with Palau\u2019s constitution \ndue to the occurrence of a disaster caused by natural hazards. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.
