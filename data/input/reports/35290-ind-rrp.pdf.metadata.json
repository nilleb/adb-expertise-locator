The  first \n(PFR)  has  been  classified  as \nperiodic \nenvironment  category  B.  An overall summary initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) and four IEEs have been conducted.  \n \nindigenous  peoples' \nA \ndevelopment  framework  have  been  prepared  for  the  MFF.  The \nfirst  PFR  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement \nand  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples'  development.  A  draft \nresettlement  plan  has  been  undertaken  for  Gangtok\u2019s  water \nsupply rehabilitation subproject. \n \nThe  proposed  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development \nInvestment Program (NERCCDIP) has been designed to improve \nthe  urban  environment  and  promote  reforms  for  sustainable, \nefficient, and responsive urban service delivery in the capital cities \nof five states in the North Eastern Region (NER), namely, Agartala \n(Nagaland),  Sikkim \n(Tripura),  Aizawl \n(Gangtok)  and  Shillong  (Meghalaya).  The  physical  investments \ninvolve  improvements  in  water  supply,  sanitation  and  sewerage, \nand \ninfrastructure.  Physical \nimprovements  will  be  coupled  with  urban  governance,  finance, \nand  service  delivery  reforms  and  a  capacity-building  program  to \nsupport  the  implementation  of  NERCCDIP  and  the  urban  reform \nagenda.  \n \nThe MFF will finance subprojects under NERCCDIP, provided the \ncentral  Government  and  the  state  governments  of  Meghalaya, \nMizoram,  Nagaland,  Sikkim,  and  Tripura  comply  with \nthe \nassurances  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  the \nconstituent subprojects are in line with those assurances and the \ncriteria set out in the framework financing agreement (FFA). \n \n\nsolid  waste  management \n\n(Mizoram),  Kohima \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nthe  NER,  one  of \n\nADB will provide loans to finance projects under the MFF as soon \nas  the  projects  are  ready  for  financing  and  after  a  satisfactory \nrelated PFR is submitted. Each loan will constitute a tranche and \nmay  carry  terms  different from the financing terms  of previous  or \nlater  loans.  The  choice  of  financing  terms  will  depend  on  the \nproject  and  ADB\u2019s  financing  policies  at  the  time  the  loan  is \ndocumented  in  a  legal  document.  Tranches  may  be  provided  in \nsequence or simultaneously, and may overlap.  \n \nA  core  objective  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012)  of  the \nGovernment  is  reducing  regional  disparities.  Investments  in \ninfrastructure  and  services \nIndia\u2019s \nin \nless-developed  regions,  have  priority.  The  10th  and  11th  plans \nhighlight  the  vital  role  of  capital  cities  in  NER\u2019s  socioeconomic \ntransformation.  Given  the  difficult  access  to  and  remoteness  of \nNER, the capital cities perform a function of a much higher order \nthan  other  cities  of  similar  size  in  India.  With  the  opening  up  of \ntrade  with  neighboring  countries  and  the  emergence  of  transport \ncorridors  in the  region, these  cities  are  expected to  play  an  even \ngreater  strategic  role  in  NER\u2019s  economy  as  commercial  and \nbusiness  hubs  besides being  administrative  centers. Investments \nin  urban  infrastructure  and  services  will  be  the key  to  unleashing \nthe potential of these cities to catalyze the growth of NER.  \n \nThe  11th  plan  also  stresses  the  importance  of  improving  the \nquality  of  governance  and  service  delivery  systems,  to  pace \nNER\u2019s development. It advocates a two-pronged approach linking \nfunds  for  capital  investments  with  reforms.  The  plan\u2019s  main \nreference for reforms is the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of \n1994,  which  promotes  decentralized  urban  governance. With  the \nJawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission, \nthe \nGovernment has reaffirmed its commitment to urban development \nthrough  investments  in  a  number  of  cities,  subject  to  the  cities\u2019 \ncommitment  to  reforms  for  decentralized  and  sustainable  urban \nservice  delivery.  NERCCDIP,  as  well  as  the  sector  road  maps \nfrom which it is derived, is guided by this policy framework. Its aim \nis  to contribute  to the Government\u2019s goal  of bringing  the  NER  up \nto par with developed regions of India. The Program links capital \ninvestments  to  reforms  for  sustainable  impact.  It  targets  the \ncapital  cities  that  will  spearhead  the  development  of  NER  linking \nIndia to the neighboring states.  \n \nThe expected impact of NERCCDIP is improved environment and \nwell-being  of  urban  residents  in  the  five  capital  cities.  The \nexpected  outcome  at  the  end  of  the  program  will  be  sustainable \nand  increased  access  to  better  urban  services  in  five  program \ncities. To this end, NERCCDIP will (i) improve and expand urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  the  cities,  including  slums;  and  (ii) \nstrengthen  the  urban  institutional,  management,  and  financing \ncapacity  of  the  local  institutions,  particularly  the  urban  local \nbodies. NERCCDIP will ensure that benefits from investments are \n\n\fiii \n\nenjoyed by the poor, women, and all other vulnerable groups.  \n \nOf the estimated $1.9 billion in long-term investment requirements \nfor  the  NER  capital  cities  according  to  the  sectoral  road  maps, \nNERCCDIP is expected to provide $285.7 million equivalent. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of India and state \ngovernments \nTotal \n \n\nTotal \n200.0 \n 85.7 \n\n285.7 \n\n% \n\n70 \n30 \n\n100 \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  facility  of  up  to  $200.0  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility.  The  Government  will \nensure  that  the  state  governments  of  Meghalaya,  Mizoram, \nNagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura use the proceeds of each tranche \nfor  the  expenditures  of  NERCCDIP,  according  to  the  conditions \nset forth in the FFA and the legal agreements for each tranche. \n \nA loan of $30.0 million has been requested under the first PFR to \ncover part of the cost of project 1. The Government will make the \nthrough \nto  the  state  governments \nloan  proceeds  available \ngovernment grants (90%) and government loans (10%).  \n \nNERCCDIP  resources  will  be  tentatively  available  in  three \ntranches  (or more  if  needed)  until  30  June  2016  (the  last  PFR  is \nexpected to be submitted by 31 December 2012).  \n \n31 December  2015 \n\ninvestment  program  coordination  cell \n\n \nThe  national  executing  agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Urban \nDevelopment  (MOUD).  The  state  executing  agencies  (SEAs)  will \nbe the Urban Development Department for Tripura and Nagaland, \nthe  Urban  Development  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Department  for \nMizoram,  the  Urban  Affairs  Department  for  Meghalaya,  and  the \nUrban Development and Housing Department for Sikkim. \n \nAn \n(IPCC)  will  be \nestablished  in  MOUD.  IPCC  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nmanagement  of  NERCCDIP  in  the  five  cities.  This  team  of \ntechnical,  and  social  and \nadministrative  and \nenvironmental  officials  (at  least  three),  under  an  investment \nprogram  manager,  will  (i)  monitor  overall  NERCCDIP  physical \nprogress  and \nthe  subprojects \nsubmitted  by  the  states  according  to  the  subproject  selection \ncriteria  and  submit  PFRs  to  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs, \n(iii)  consolidate  payment  and  reimbursement  requests,  (iv)  report \n\nimplementation, \n\nfinancial, \n\nreview \n\n(ii) \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nthe  subprojects, \n\nthe  detailed  designs  of \n\nto ADB on the progress of NERCCDIP implementation and other \nmatters, (v) monitor implementation of the overall reform program \nand  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  (vi)  provide  assistance \nto the states. A national steering committee will monitor the overall \nuse of the MFF. \n  \nA  consolidated  state  investment  program  management  and \nimplementation  unit  (SIPMIU)  will  be  established  in  each  of  the \nfive  SEAs.  A  state  steering  committee  (SSC)  and  an  investment \nprogram  empowered  committee  will  also  be  established  in  each \nstate.  The  SIPMIU,  to  be  headed  by  a  state  investment  program \ndirector,  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and  implementing \nNERCCDIP  in  the  state,  including  monitoring  its  progress; \npreparing  and  forwarding  subprojects  for  approval  to  SSC  and \nMOUD;  ensuring  compliance  with  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework,  subproject  selection  criteria,  loan  covenants,  and \nurban reform targets; and coordinating with MOUD and other state \nagencies  in  the  selection  of  consultants  and  contractors,  the \napproval  of \nthe \npreparation  of  disbursement  requests  and  their  forwarding  to \nMOUD for submission to ADB, the administration of the contracts \nof  consultants  and  contractors,  the  certification  of  payments  and \nthe  preparation  of  change  orders,  and  the  implementation  of \nawareness programs and environment and resettlement plans.  \n \nAll  goods  and  services  under  NERCCDIP  will  be  procured \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Civil  works contracts estimated at $5.0 million \nor more, and supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher, will \nundergo  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  and  supply \ncontracts  costing  less  than  those  amounts  will  be  procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding.  Goods  below  $100,000  in \nvalue  will  be  procured  through  shopping.  The  feasibility  of \ncommunity  contracting  will  be  examined  individually  for  low-cost \nsanitation and other community works not exceeding $100,000 in \nvalue. \n \nConsultants  will  be  hired  by  each  of  the  five  SIPMIUs  to  support \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  management,  and \ninstitutional  development  activities.  The  need  for  consulting \nservices is expected to decline gradually during implementation as \nthe  SIPMIUs  and  SEAs  increase  their  capacity,  and  will  be \nreviewed after the first two tranches are completed. \n \nMOUD  will  also  be  supported  by  a  program  management  and \nmonitoring  consultant,  who  will  (i)  assist  program  coordination  by \nmonitoring  and  reporting  regularly  on  progress, \nidentifying \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  and \nrecommending  corrective \nactions;  (ii)  review  the  subproject  appraisal  reports  prepared  by \nthe SIPMIUs and support the preparation of PFRs for submission; \n(iii)  support  capacity-building  activities;  and  (iv)  draft  an  urban \n\n\fv \n\ninstitutions, \n\nincluding  established \n\nreform action and monitoring plan. \n \nAgencies  or \nregistered \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  will  also  be  hired  for \nparticipatory  planning,  community  awareness  activities,  and \nsurveys, among others. All consultants and NGOs will be recruited \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nNERCCDIP  will  benefit  the  estimated  1.2  million  people  who  are \nexpected  to  be  living  in  the  five  cities  by  2015,  by  improving  the \nurban  environment  and  thus  the  health  and  living  conditions  and \nproductivity  of  the  residents.  The  rise  in  productivity  and  urban \nefficiency  resulting  from  the  urban  infrastructure  and  service \nimprovements  will  benefit  their  economies.  As  their  infrastructure \nand  services  improve,  the  cities  will  be  better  able  to  answer  the \ngrowing needs of industry and trade resulting from investments in \ntransport  and  NER  connectivity.  All  NERCCDIP  interventions  will \nbenefit  the  poor  directly  or  indirectly.  Improvements  in  citywide \ninfrastructure, e.g., sanitation and sewerage, will have a profound \nimpact on the poor, most of whom live in vulnerable and low-lying \nareas.  Further,  NERCCDIP  will  ensure  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment  by  supporting  urban  reforms  and  capacity  building \nfor  better  urban  governance  and  service  delivery.  All  these \nimprovements  will  reduce  the  disparities  between  NER  and  the \ndeveloped regions of India.  \n \nNERCCDIP\u2019s  potential  risks  include  the  following:  (i)  public \nresistance  to  the  water  metering  program;  (ii)  low  connectivity  to \nthe  new  sewerage  network;  (iii)  delayed  implementation  of  the \nurban reform agenda by the state governments, and unwillingness \nof  the  public  to  pay  for  the  services;  and  (iv) slow  program \nthe  states\u2019  unfamiliarity  with  ADB \nimplementation  due \nprocedures.  \n \nMeasures incorporated into the program design will address these \npotential  risks.  Civic  awareness  programs  will  stimulate  demand \nfor  better  services  and  willingness  to  pay.  Regulations  to  be \nissued  will  require  residents  to  connect  to  the  new  networks. \nNERCCDIP\u2019s strategy of linking investments to reforms will create \nincentives for reforms and ADB\u2019s continued policy dialogue during \nNERCCDIP implementation will provide further reinforcement. \n \nThe risk  of  slow  implementation  is  being  addressed from  several \nangles  including  (i)  ongoing  technical  assistance  in  project \nimplementation  and  capacity  development, \nthe  early \nappointment  of  project  management  consultants,  and  (iii)  the \nproposed establishment of an ADB extension office in the NER.  \n \nFinally, to address the risk of destruction to assets due to natural \nhazards, earthquake faults and slip lines have been mapped and \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\n \nInvestment Program \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \n\nvarious  components  have  been  designed  to  protect  against \ndamage.  All  detailed  designs  will  incorporate  further  measures, \nsuch as comprehensive geotechnical assessments.  \n  \n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF)1 for India for the North Eastern Region (NER) Capital Cities \nDevelopment Investment Program (NERCCDIP). The design and monitoring framework for the \nNERCCDIP is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES   \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n\n2. \nThe NER, where the five states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura \nare located, is one of India\u2019s least-developed regions. It is remote, landlocked, and far from the \nmarkets in the mainland. Only 2% of its territory connect the region to the rest of India through a \nnarrow land corridor. The five states share an international boundary with Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Myanmar,  and  Nepal.  The  five  states  are  encumbered  by \ndifficult  terrain  and  a  mountainous  periphery.  In  these  predominantly  agricultural  and \ngovernment service economies, there is scant exploitation of natural resources and progress in \nindustry,  the  private  sector  and  foreign  direct  investment  are  negligible,  and  unemployment  is \nhigh.  In  2003/04\u20132006/07  economic  growth  in  the  NER  was  3.4%  yearly,  compared  with  the \nnational  average  of  around  7.8%.  The  region  contributes  only  0.2%  to  the  national  output  but \n4.4% of the total population. Social indicators in the NER have nonetheless improved over the \nlast  decade.  Literacy  is  nearly  100%  in  three  of  the  five  cities  and  about  two  thirds  of  the \npopulation  of  all  five  cities2 has  had  at  least  a  secondary  education.  While  life  expectancy  at \nbirth  is  lower  than  the  national  average,  the  infant  mortality  rate  is  better  than  the  national \naverage of 68 per 1,000 live births. \n \n3. \nThe urbanization rate in NER (15%) is lower than in the rest of India (27.8%). The rapid \ngrowth of urban populations since independence has been driven by high natural growth rates, \naccession  to  statehood,  insurrections  in  the  countryside,  and  the  flow  of  government  funding \ninto NER. Urban development in the five states is dominated by the capital cities, which account \nfor more than 60% of the states\u2019 total urban population. The population in the five capital cities \nranges  from  a  low  of  93,000  in  Gangtok  to  a  high  of  about  380,000  in  Agartala.  These  cities \nhave  grown  annually  by  up  to  more  than  5%  in  the  past.  The  growth  rates  are  projected  to \ndecline in the future but are still expected to range from 1.8%\u20133% yearly over the next 15 years.  \n \n4. \nAll  five  capital  cities  are  in  seismic  zone  V  and  are  therefore  highly  susceptible  to \nearthquakes. All have tropical monsoon climates. The location of all the cities except Agartala, \non  top  of  steep  mountain  slopes,  constrains  physical  growth,  makes  development  costly,  and \ncontributes to vulnerability to landslips. The NER\u2019s poor connectivity with and isolation from the \nrest of India and the countries on its borders severely limits the development of the five cities. \nBut  the  geographic  status  of  the  states  and  the  capital  cities  is  changing  as  ongoing  and \nplanned transport projects link the capital cities to one another, to the rest of India, and to the \nneighboring countries. Improved connectivity, combined with India\u2019s recent policy of opening up \nits  borders  to  trade  with  neighbors  and  to  a  better  relationship  with  the  rest  of  South  Asia,  as \n                                                 \n1   NERCCDIP has been designed as an MFF primarily because of the broad and complex institutional and financial \nreform agenda associated with the Government\u2019s road map, which requires a long-term partnership between ADB \nand India and the North Eastern states, and performance-based approaches. MFF will allow flexibility in investment \ndecisions based on the needs and constraints in each city, progress with the reform agenda, and the readiness of \nindividual  subprojects  and  cities.  It  will  enable  long-term  engagement  to  build  the  capacity  of  urban  local  bodies \nand  will  provide  proper  incentives  for  performance  improvements,  with  individual  loans  linked  to  reform  targets \nstretched over a realistic time frame.  \n\n2   Agartala (Tripura), Aizawl (Mizoram), Gangtok (Sikkim), Kohima (Nagaland), and Shillong (Meghalaya). \n\n\f2 \n\nwell  as  with  Southeast  and  East  Asian  countries,  presents  immense  opportunities  for  NER\u2019s \ncapital cities, which could become dynamic economic hubs.  \n \n5. \nAll the states rank low on the infrastructure index. The five capital cities are held back by \ninadequate urban infrastructure and services from fulfilling the development potential created by \na latent productive labor force and increasing connectivity. From 15% to 25% of the population \nin these cities lives below the poverty line, according to the states\u2019 income-based classification. \nPoverty based on non-income factors (access to basic urban services) is higher, indicating that \nthe  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services  not  only  constrains  the  economic  growth  of  the \ncities but also contributes in a major way to poverty.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInadequate Urban Infrastructure and Services  \n\n6. \nUrban  infrastructure  and  services  (water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  urban  transport,  and  roads)  in  the  five  NER  cities  are  considered  grossly \ninadequate.3 The percentage of the population with access to central piped water supply ranges \nfrom  50%  in  Shillong to 80%  in Gangtok.  Service  is  poor.  Agartala  has piped  water for  only  a \nfew  hours  a  day;  Aizawl,  Kohima,  and  Shillong are  supplied  with  water  for  only  a few  hours  a \nweek  in  the  dry  season.  Distribution  systems  in  all  the  cities  are  old  and  inadequate,  and \nproduction  capacity  in  Aizawl  and  Kohima  is  substantially  below  demand.  Most  cities  have \n\u201cbunched\u201d service connection systems, where consumers make their own connections to small \nsupply  tanks.  These  individual  connection  pipes,  mostly  laid  along  drains,  cause  system \ninefficiencies, are prone to contamination, and interfere with other services. A critical issue is the \nhigh  rate  of  unaccounted-for  water  in  the  cities:  officially  it  ranges  from  35%  to  50%,  but  the \nactual figures are higher. Water is unmetered in the cities except Aizawl, and to a limited extent \nKohima, where metering and volumetric charging have recently been introduced.  \n \n7. \nThere  are  no  centralized  piped  sewer  systems  in  the  cities  except  Gangtok,  and  its \nsystem serves only about 12% of the population. About 72% of households in the region have \nseptic  tanks  or  soak  pits  with  wastewater  percolating  into  the  soil,  and  an  overflow  to  the \nnearest drain or stream. Sullage water is often directed to drains. On average, about 95% of the \npopulation of the cities has access to a toilet (or a shared toilet) at home, while 5% uses either a \npublic toilet or an open field. Septic tank emptying services are insufficient in all the cities except \nAizawl,  and  there  are  no  waste  treatment  facilities.  Public  health  regulations  that  control  the \ndischarge  of  sewage  are  still  to  be  met.  Inadequate  sanitation  causes  pollution  of  the  ground, \nstreams,  and  roadside  drains,  presenting  a  severe  environmental  and  health  risk.  Inadequate \nsanitation is also a major cause of landslips in all the hill cities.  \n  \nOn average, only 30%\u201350% of solid waste generated is collected and, depending on the \n8. \nState,  3%\u201334%  of  households  have  access  to  house-to-house  services.  There  is  little  or  no \nprovision for the collection and disposal of hazardous wastes; these are generally disposed of \nthrough open dumping and burning. A substantial proportion of households dump their wastes \nin  the  nearest  open  space  or  drain,  and  many  others  do  the  same  from  time  to  time.  The \nsituation is worse in low-income areas, where, despite the communities\u2019 best efforts, there are \nsimply not enough resources to provide the necessary services, and in the hill towns, where the \nhills  are too  steep to  allow  collection  vehicles  to  enter  and  bins  are  difficult to  use.  Equipment \nuse is generally inefficient, and wastes collected, transported, and disposed of are not recorded. \n\n                                                 \n3   LEA International. 2006.

Guwahati.  \n\n\f3 \n\nAlthough  management  is  not  without  difficulties,  Gangtok  and  Shillong  operate  composting \nplants. Other cities have no treatment facilities.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nUrban Governance and Management    \n\nAn  analysis  of  urban  institutions  and  finances  in  the  five  NER  states  suggests  that \n9. \ninadequate urban governance and management systems contribute significantly to poor urban \nplanning,  infrastructure, and  services  in  the  cities.  Dedicated  urban  local  authorities  are  still  at \nan  early  stage  of  development  in  several  capital  cities.  Only  Agartala  has  a  fully  functioning \nurban local body (ULB) with a service area that encompasses most of the urban built-up area, \nbut its jurisdiction, ward boundaries, and municipal limits still have to be finalized. Shillong has a \nmunicipal  board  but  no  elected  council,  and  the  board  serves  only  about  30%  of  the  city. \nKohima has a municipality with an elected council, but its effectiveness is circumscribed by legal \nprovisions  inconsistent  with  the  concept  of  a  ULB,  its  pure-conservancy  functions,  and  small \narea  of  coverage.  In  Gangtok,  no  ULB  has  existed  since  1985;  the  Sikkim  Municipal  Bill  was \npassed  in  2007  but  is  yet  to  be  implemented.  The  Aizawl  Municipal  Council  was  formed  in \nJune 2008 and elections to the council are to be held within 12 months, but jurisdiction has yet \nto be defined and functions are still to be transferred.  \n \n10. \nUrban  governance  is  further  complicated  by  conflicts  between  modern  legislation  and \ntraditional  governance  structures  in  some  cities.  Shillong,  for  example,  comes  under  the \n6th Schedule to the Constitution, which calls for traditional systems of governance for scheduled \ntribes.4 The overlapping jurisdictions of modern and traditional structures affect service delivery. \nMoreover, without fully functioning ULBs, these cities provide many urban services through their \nstates\u2019 departments. But these departments, having limited resources and wide responsibility for \nboth urban and rural areas within the states, cannot provide the dedicated management needed \nto  meet  the  diverse  demands  of  the  growing  and  densely  populated  cities.  Water  supply  and \nsanitation are generally the responsibility of the state departments of public health engineering \n(PHEDs).  Infrastructure  builders  by  tradition,  PHEDs  are  not  equipped  with  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  skills  and  resources.  They  lack  proper  asset  management  systems  and \ntheir operating costs are often high. Sanitation regulations are also poorly enforced.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nUrban Finance   \n\n11. \nUrban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  five  capital  cities  are  mostly  financed  by  the \ncentral Government through the state governments. Only a few small schemes are financed by \nthe  private  sector.  Most  funding  goes  to  major  capital  works;  little  funding  is  set  aside  for  the \nrepair  and  replacement  of  infrastructure.  The  states  and  ULBs  lack  revenues  of  their  own  to \nattend to the O&M of infrastructure and services and to sustain service delivery. \n \nUser charges and urban-based taxes are only partially implemented, if at all. Among the \n12. \nfive  capital  cities,  only  Agartala  and  Shillong 5  levy  property  taxes. 6  The  introduction  and \nrationalization of user charges is also a challenge. Water charges are levied in all the cities but \n\n                                                 \n4   In  Shillong,  the  dorbar  (traditional  assembly  or  council  of  elders)  system  of  governance  coexists  with  the  state \n\ngovernment.  \n\n5   The Shillong Municipal Board has already set up a unit area\u2013based system with a property database backed by a \n\ngeographic information system. Agartala, on the other hand, is still to migrate to such a system. \n\n6   In  Aizawl  a  government  notification  regarding  the  introduction  of  property  tax  has  been  issued.  Kohima  has  no \nproperty tax, although the Nagaland Municipal Act, 2001, provides for one. In Gangtok, the introduction of property \ntax should follow the formation of a ULB. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nare far below the operating costs and are, for the most part, not based on consumption.7 They \ncover  no  more  than  10%\u201330%  of  O&M  costs.  Aizawl  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  Kohima  have \nintroduced  water  metering  and  volumetric  charges,  not  without  problems.  Aizawl  and  Kohima \nlevy  no  solid  waste  charges.  Agartala  and  Shillong  obtain  revenues  from  a  solid  waste \nmanagement tax included in the property tax. Gangtok levies small \u201ctoilet charges\u201d monthly and \nsolid  waste  management  fees  yearly.  Again,  revenues  are  substantially  below  O&M  needs. \nPoor financial management and accounting systems8 are also responsible for the poor services. \nIn these cities the gap between the residents\u2019 desire and willingness to pay for better services \nand the level of services is widening.  \n\n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned  \n\n13. \nExternal  Assistance.  The  five  NER  states  have  not  received  any  large-scale  external \nassistance  for  urban  sector  development.  Only  the  roads  sector  has  had  sizable  external \nassistance, from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). External assistance \nto the urban sector has been confined to pilot small-scale infrastructure schemes and capacity \nbuilding.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  recently  completed  a \nsmall water supply, sewerage, and solid waste management project in Gangtok and Shillong.  \n \n14. \nUntil  recently,  ADB  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  in  India  has  been  directed  toward \nother  states.  ADB  has  provided  38  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  totalling  $36.75  million  to \nIndia\u2019s  urban  sector  since  1993,  and  has  approved  $3.61  billion  in  loans  for  14  projects.  The \nassistance, mostly for integrated urban infrastructure and services projects, has been aimed at \npoverty reduction through shared growth, social development, and good governance. Recently, \ngiven  the  need  to  redress  the  growing  regional  disparities  in  the  country,  ADB  committed  to \ndiversify its operations to the northern states, which it identified as priority geographic areas of \nassistance.  An  advisory TA for the  preparation  of  an  urban  sector  profile  of  the  North  Eastern \nstates was followed by a project preparatory TA for the NERCCDIP. In addition, an advisory TA9 \nfor  capacity  building  in  NER  is  being  implemented  to  provide  project  management  and \nimplementation support to agencies and improve their project preparedness. Appendix 2 gives \ndetails of external support to the urban sector in India.  \n \n15. \nLessons.  ADB\u2019s experience in the urban sector in India reveals that complex issues in \nurban  development  projects 10  (i)  require  greater  coordination  among  concerned  agencies, \nstronger  institutional  capacity,  and  the  active  participation  of  stakeholders;  (ii) delay  project \nimplementation,  especially  during  project  start-up;  and  (iii) compromise  the  sustainability  of \nproject assets. The experience suggests that (i) up-front support for capacity building in project \nmanagement  and  implementation  minimizes  delays  in  project  start-up;  and  (ii)  more  attention \nmust  be  paid  to  ensuring  sustainability  by  building  the  capacity  of  ULBs  and  other  urban \ninstitutions and service providers to plan, manage, and finance urban development. A number of \nNER-specific lessons can also be gleaned from the ongoing World Bank\u2013funded roads project. \nterrain  delay \nIn  particular, \nimplementation, constrain supply, and raise costs beyond the amounts envisaged at the design \nstage.  These  lessons  indicate  the  need  to  extend  the  period  of  implementation,  including \n\ninstitutional  capacity,  poor  connectivity,  and  difficult \n\nlow \n\n                                                 \n7   In Agartala and Shillong, revenue functions for water services are vested in the ULB, while capital works and O&M \n\n(only partly for Shillong) rest with PHED. In other states, all three functions are PHED responsibilities. \n\n8   Accounts  of  ULBs  in  Agartala,  Kohima,  and  Shillong  are  based  on  single-entry,  cash-based  systems.  Other \nagencies (PHED, etc.) all keep regular accounts on the same basis. Aizawl, on the other hand, still has to prepare \na state accounting manual. \n\n9  ADB. 2006.

The design of NERCCDIP takes the foregoing lessons into account. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nRationale: North Eastern Region Capital Cities Development Road Map \n\nAs  reflected  in  its  policies,  the  Government  of  India  attaches  increasing  importance  to \n16. \nurban development. Under the 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) the Government committed to \ninvest  more  in  less-developed  states  and  to  build  sustainable  infrastructure  in  major  urban \nareas.11 The  Jawarhalal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM)  was  of  particular \nsignificance  in  defining  a  common  framework  for  reform 12  and  the  associated  conditional \ninfrastructure  investment  program.13 The  five  capital  cities  covered  by  NERCCDIP  are  among \nthe  63  JNNURM  cities.  All  five  NER  state  governments  have  signed  memorandums  of \nagreement with the Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD). The agreed targets and the status \nof their implementation are summarized in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n17. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012),  while  focused  on  more  broad-based  and \ninclusive  growth,  sets  to  reduce  poverty  and  disparities  between  regions  and  communities  by \nensuring access to basic physical infrastructure and a comprehensive strategy for better health, \namong  others. 14  The  recently  approved  National  Urban  Sanitation  Policy  is  an  immediate \noutcome of this vision. The private sector is identified as a key partner for rapid growth, although \nthe  11th  Plan  also  recognizes  that  public-private  partnerships  may  not  always  be  possible, \nespecially  in  more  economically  disadvantaged  areas  of  the  country,  and  that  continuous \nsupport  from  the  public  sector  is  required.  The  strategic  role  of  the  capital  cities  in  NER\u2019s \nsocioeconomic transformation  is  also recognized. Given  the  difficult terrain  and  remoteness  of \nNER to mainland India, the capital cities perform a function of a much higher order than capital \ncities of similar size in the rest of India. With border trade with neighboring countries opening up \nand emerging transport corridors improving the connectivity of the cities with one another, with \nmainland  India,  and  with  neighboring  countries,  these  cities  are  expected  to  play  an  even \ngreater  role  in  the  region\u2019s  economy  as  commercial  and  business  hubs  in  addition  to  being \nadministrative  centers.  The  timely  provision  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  capital \ncities would be a key to harnessing the emerging economic potential of these cities.  \n \n18. \nThe  Vision.  The  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development  Road  Map \n(Appendix 3)  is  guided  by  the  10th  and  11th  plans,  major  urban  policy  and  legislative \ninstruments, and state-specific policies, targets, and aspirations. \n                                                 \n11  The  main  reference  for  reform  was  defined  to  be  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  of  1994  (74th  CAA), \ncreating an enabling framework for ULBs to play a pivotal role in urban service delivery and to be equipped with \nnecessary  financial  and  administrative  powers  and  capacity.  Key  areas  of  support  were  (i)  broad-based  urban \nsector  reforms  giving  the  ULBs  autonomy  and debt servicing  capability  so  that  they could  gain  access to  capital \nmarket  funds,  (ii)  rationalization  and  improvement  of  the  property  tax  system,  (iii)  promotion  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships  in  urban  sector  activities,  (iv)  studies  to  develop  a  disaggregated  picture  of  urban  growth,  and \n(v) better O&M of municipal assets. \n\n12  JNNURM reiterates the need for the states to empower ULBs to pursue reforms for the levy of user charges, the \nenhancement  of  property  tax,  the  rationalization  of  establishment  costs,  and  the  improvement  of  financial \nmanagement  systems.  It  also  advocates  balancing  asset  creation  with  asset  management,  incorporating  private \nsector efficiencies into service delivery, and making service providers financially sustainable. \n\n13  The  10th  Plan  supported  a  two-pronged  approach  whereby  funds  for  capital  investments  were  linked  to  urban \ngovernance,  finance,  and  service  delivery  reforms.  With  this  program,  the  Government  reaffirmed  its  promise  of \nsustainable  urban  development  by  committing  sizable  funds  for  fast-track  investments  in  63  cities  across  the \ncountry, subject to the cities\u2019 commitment to a range of reforms. \n\n14  Preliminary  exercises  suggest  that  investment  in  infrastructure  (defined  as  road,  rail,  air,  and  water  transport; \npower  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  telecommunication;  water  supply;  irrigation;  and  storage)  will \nneed to increase from 4.6% of GDP to around 8% in the 11th Plan period. Specific targets set forth in the 11th Plan \ninclude  (i)  the  provision  of clean  drinking  water  for all by  2009,  and  (ii)  the  treatment  of all  urban  wastewater  by \n2011\u20132012.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nThe long-term investment requirements (for the next 20 years), assessed as part of the \n19. \nroad map, is estimated to exceed $1.9 billion,15 of which $1.1 billion is needed for water supply, \nsewerage and sanitation, and solid waste management. NERCCDIP constitutes over 12% of the \nlonger-term  urban  infrastructure  investment  requirements  and  about  21%  of  the  total  required \ninvestment  in  the  three  captioned  subsectors.  It  covers  priority  investments  with  emphasis  on \nupgrading  infrastructure  and  services,  improving  operational  efficiencies,  testing  new  methods \nof  delivery  of  better  services,  and  establishing  the  institutional,  operational,  and  financial \nfoundation  for  sustainable  improvements.  Improvements  are  envisaged  to  continue  after  the \ncompletion  of  NERCCDIP,  on  the  basis  of  proven  approaches  and  enhanced  institutional  and \nfinancial  capacity  to  increase  service  coverage  by  2027.  The  states  will  need  to  avail \nthemselves of alternative sources of financing to meet the remaining investment requirements, \nfrom  potential  sources  like  JNNURM,  the  non-lapsable  central  pool  of  resources,  multilateral \ninstitutions, and the private sector.  \n \n20. \nThe  road  map,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  also  sets  a  vision  for  the \ndevelopment of urban governance, finance, and service delivery frameworks in the capital cities. \nThe  vision  entails  a  number  of  sequenced  municipal  reforms  to  develop  legislative  and \ninstitutional  frameworks  for  ULBs  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  ULBs  for  effective  and \naccountable urban service delivery. The road map stipulates as well the need for infrastructure \nand  service  provision  to  have  a  commercial  and  self-sustaining  basis  and  for  the  required \ninstitutional  mechanisms  to  be  put  in  place.  The  cities  are  foreseen  to  gradually  move  toward \ndeveloping  water  and  sewerage  agencies  that  are  capable  of  performance-based  service \ndelivery  and \nreform  measures  are  also \naccompanied  with  reforms  that  will  create  sustainable  sources  of revenues  by  introducing  and \nrationalizing user charges and urban-based taxes. \n \n21. \nNERCCDIP is designed to use the MFF because of the broader and complex agenda for \nthe  development  of  the  NER  capital  cities.  The  road  map  involves  providing  core  urban \ninfrastructure and services in five capital cities with similar geographic and locational attributes \nand growing interconnectedness but with needs and absorptive capacities that vary in degree. \nMFF, while enabling a single development framework, allows investment decisions to be flexible \nand  based  on the  specific  needs  of  each  city  and  the  readiness  of  individual  subprojects,  and \nnot  on  a  strict  definition  of  needs  up-front.  The  road  map  also  involves  a  complex  agenda  of \ninstitutional  and  financial  reforms  that  necessitates  a  long-term  partnership  between  ADB  and \nIndia  and  its  NER  states,  and  performance-based  approaches.  MFF  allows  long-term \nengagement  to  build  the  capacity  of  urban  institutions  and  ULBs  and  proper  incentives  for \nimproved performance, with individual loans linked to reform targets over a realistic period. \n \n\nfinancial  self-sustainability.  The \n\ninstitutional \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n22. \nThe  expected  impact  of  NERCCDIP  is  improved  environment  and  well-being  of  urban \nresidents  in  the  five  capital  cities.  The  expected  outcome  at  the  end  of  the  program  will  be \nsustainable and increased access to better urban services in five program cities.  To this end, (i) \nurban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  capital  cities,  including  slums,  will  be  improved  and \nexpanded;  and  (ii) the  institutional,  managerial,  and financial  capacity  of the  urban  institutions, \nincluding ULBs, will be strengthened. The benefits from investments will be enjoyed by the poor, \n\n                                                 \n15  This  value  has  been  derived  from  adding  the  estimate  for  infrastructure  development  in  each  individual  city \n\ndevelopment plan (as required under JNNURM) and updated in value as of October 2008. \n\n\f7 \n\nwomen, and all other vulnerable groups, and any negative environmental and social impact will \nbe minimized or prevented. \n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThere  are  two  groups  of  outputs:  (i)  urban  infrastructure  and  service  improvements, \n23. \nincluding  the  rehabilitation,  improvement,  and  expansion  of  water  supply,  sewerage  and \nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  facilities  (part  A);  and  (ii)  program  management  and \nimplementation  assistance,  and  comprehensive  capacity  building  for  institutional  and  financial \nreforms,  planning,  O&M,  revenue  mobilization,  and  financial  management,  to  increase \nsustainability (part B). The size and type of the urban infrastructure and service improvements \nunder  part  A  may  vary  depending  on  the  specific  needs  and  demands  of  each  city,  as \ndetermined  in  infrastructure  master  planning  exercises,  social  surveys,  and  stakeholder \nconsultations.16 \n \n\nPart A: Urban Infrastructure and Service Improvement  \n\n1. \n \n\n24.  Water Supply. Investments in this regard will be aimed at improving the quality of water \nand  extending  the  service  duration  all  year  round  to  at  least  12  hours  a  day  throughout  the \nsystem and 24 hours a day in most parts of the cities, and completely meeting demand by the \nend of the NERCCDIP. The investments, to be made in Agartala, Aizawl, Gangtok, and Kohima, \nwill  involve  expanding  water  production  capacity  through  source  and  treatment  works  (in \nAgartala);  expanding  and  rehabilitating  distribution  systems,  reservoirs,  and  machinery; \nreplacing \u201cbunched\u201d service connections (in the four hill cities) and old and leaking connections; \ninstalling  bulk  and  consumer  meters;  and  reducing  non-revenue  water  (NRW).  The \ninfrastructure  improvements  will  be  supported  by  awareness  campaigns  to  promote  water \nconservation,  demand  for  water  supply  improvements,  and  sustainability  and  cost  recovery \nobjectives.17  \n \n25. \nSewerage and Sanitation. The sewerage and sanitation improvement program will take \na two-pronged approach comprising (i) the construction of central piped sewerage and sewage \ntreatment  systems  and  the  provision  of  service  connections;  and  (ii)  the  improvement  of \nsanitation systems that rely on individual systems, particularly septic tanks and soak pits, until \nsewerage  systems  can be  built.  Community  latrines  will  also  be  provided  in  low-income  areas \nand \nimproving  sanitation.  The  sewerage \nimprovements are designed as modestly sized components serving the worst-affected areas of \nall  cities  but  Agartala18 as  the  first  stage  of  the  development  of  sewerage  master  plans.  The \nimprovements take into account (i) availability of enough wastewater to provide for gravity flows; \n(ii) efficient zoning of each city to minimize the number of treatment plants while still relying on \ngravity flows, and to avoid pumping; (iii) avoidance of sewage overflows due to pumping station \nfailure  from  power  supply  shortage;  (iv) alignment  and  avoidance  of  landslip  and  earthquake \nrisk;  and  (v) affordability.  The  infrastructure  improvements  will  be  supported  by  awareness \ncampaigns to promote understanding of the need for better sanitation, increase demand for the \nimprovements,  and  gain  broad  acceptance  of  higher  service  rates  to  cover  the  cost  of  the \n\nlow-income  households  will  be  assisted \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n16  A  comprehensive  description  of  all  activities  proposed  under  the  NERCCDIP  and  the  first  periodic  financing \n\nrequest for each of the cities can be found in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n\n17  Improvements in water schemes for Shillong are being considered for JNNURM financing. \n18  The government of Tripura has indicated that financial assistance for the construction of a sewerage system in the \nCentral Zone has been allocated from other financiers, such as JNNURM. In the interim, according to data from the \nsocioeconomic  surveys,  consumers  must  be  more  willing  to  pay  for  sewerage  services.  Awareness  programs \nunder the MFF will support this imitative.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nimprovements. Assistance in implementing sanitation regulations to prevent unsafe discharge of \nsanitary wastes also forms part of the sewerage improvements. \n \n26. \nSolid Waste Management. The improvements in solid waste management will increase \nservice coverage to more than 80%. To this end, (i) awareness campaigns will be launched to \npromote  understanding  of  the  importance  of  good  sanitation  and  in-house  waste  collection, \nsegregation, and recycling; (ii) solid waste collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal will \nbe improved through the provision of solid waste equipment, the construction of transfer stations \nas needed, and the development of sanitary landfill sites and composting plants;19 and (iii)  solid \nwaste operations will be made more efficient through the introduction of improved management \nsystems  for  the  routing  and  scheduling  of  vehicles,  other  machinery,  and  staff  and  training \nprograms  to  maximize  the  benefits  from  investments  in  infrastructure  and  equipment.  All \nprogram components are described in detail in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n\nPart B: Capacity Building and Investment Program Management  \n\n2. \n \n27. \nUrban Governance and Financing. NERCCDIP will support the state governments and \nULBs in meeting their commitments to the institutional and financial reform agenda in line with \nthe  policies  of  the  central  and  state  governments.  In  particular,  it  will  help  (i) further  reforms \nassociated  with  the  creation  and  strengthening  of  ULBs,  (ii)  incorporate  efficiencies  and \ncommercial  principles  into  service  delivery  through  the  gradual  introduction  of  sustainable \nservice delivery agencies especially in water supply and sewerage, and (iii) implement financial \nmanagement  reforms  to  promote  sustainable  sources  of  financing  and  the  transparent  use  of \nfinancial resources for service delivery.  \n \n28.  Municipalization.  NERCCDIP  will  assist  the  states  in  implementing  the  74th  CAA  by \nsupporting  them  in  (i)  conducting  civic  awareness  campaigns  and  public  hearings  toward  the \ncreation and strengthening of ULBs, (ii) preparing or strengthening municipal legislation20 with a \nview  to  transferring  functions  from  the  state  to  the  ULB,  and  (iii)  conceptualizing  and \nimplementing  organizational  development  measures  and  introducing  operational  systems \nimprovements. 21 Efforts  will  be  made  to  integrate  traditional  structures  into  emerging  urban \ngovernance frameworks.  Such  improvements  will  be  complemented  by  comprehensive  human \nresource development programs and training for officials. \n \n29.  Municipal  Financial  Reform. Improvements will be made in accounting and budgeting \nsystems and practices through the adoption of accrual-base accounting, the use of geographic \ninformation  systems  in  revenue  administration,  and  the  computerization  of  financial  systems. \nimplementation  of \nin  the  design, \nAssistance  will  also  be  extended \nconsumption-based and progressive user charges and improved property taxation to enable the \nrecovery of full O&M costs by the end of the NERCCDIP implementation period.  \n                                                 \n19 Improvements will be introduced in all program cities. Composting facilities will be built in all towns but Shillong and \n\nintroduction,  and \n\nGangtok, which already have such facilities. \n\n20  One  or  more  of  the  following  actions  may  be  included:  (i)  framing  rules  under  the  Municipal  Act  to  govern \nday-to-day  administration,  (ii)  issuing  an  executive  order  constituting  a  municipality,  (iii)  agreeing  on  general \nprinciples of demarcating municipal boundaries and wards, (iv) amending the Municipality Act according to the 74th \nCAA, (v) issuing government orders and notifications transferring functions listed under the 12th Schedule of the \n74th CAA, (vi) framing the rules for ward delimitation, (vii) holding municipal elections, (viii) agreeing on a proposed \nstaffing  and  reporting  structure  and  manpower  requirements  and  submitting  recommendations  on  these  to  the \nimplementing \nState  Finance  Commission, \nits \nrecommendations,  and  (x) submitting  recommended  municipal  budget  allocations \nthe  State  Finance \nCommission. \n\nthe  State  Finance  Commission  and \n\n(ix)  constituting \n\n21  Such as (i) fixing of cadre strength and responsibilities for various levels of officers; (ii) definition of job functions, \nskills,  and  qualification  requirements;  (iii)  short-term  training  for  new  staff  and  officers;  and  (iv)  improving \nrecruitment and transfer policies. \n\nto \n\n\f9 \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nImproved  Service  Delivery.  NERCCDIP  will  also  support  the  states  in  (i) improving \noperational  and  financial  efficiency  and  asset  management, 22 and  (ii)  restructuring  over  the \nshort term the states\u2019 departments into a single ring fenced area with dedicated responsibility for \ncity  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  for  accounting  and  financial  management.  The \ncapacity-building  component  will  also  include  an  umbrella  program  of  civic  awareness  and \ncommunity  participation  (in  waste  segregation,  among  other  activities)  to  support  the \nimplementation  and  positive  impact  of  all  the  physical  improvements  under  NERCCDIP.23 The \nparticipation  of  the  city  residents,  including  the  women,  the  poor,  the  slum  communities,  and \nother vulnerable groups, in program implementation and their equal sharing in its benefits will be \nensured.  \n \n31. \nImproved  Capacity  to  Manage  NERCCDIP.  This  component  will  provide  funding \nsupport  for  costs  associated  with  NERCCDIP  management  and  implementation,  including  the \nincremental administrative and operating costs of program management units in MOUD and the \nstates,  equipment,  logistics,  and  the  services  of  consultants  who  will  assist  these  units  in \nmanaging  NERCCDIP  and  carrying  out  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  Such \nsupport  is  considered  essential  to  the  implementation  of  NERCCDIP  in  view  of  the  proposed \nexecuting  agencies\u2019  lack  of  experience  with  undertakings  of  this  size,  and  implementation \nthrough separate design and construction contracts.  \n \nC. \n \n32. \nPlanned  and  Integrated  Approach  to  City  Development.  The  design of  NERCCDIP \nbenefits  from  a  planned  approach.  Long-term  investment  requirements  were  identified,  and \nNERCCDIP and subprojects designed, on the basis of city growth strategies and infrastructure \nmaster  plans.  NERCCDIP  also  follows  the  principle  of  integrated  provision  of  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  to  harness  synergies  and  realize  the  full  potentials  from  individual \nsector improvements.  \n \nReform Orientation: Urban Governance, Finance, and Service Delivery Reforms. In \n33. \nsupport of the Government\u2019s urban policy NERCCDIP will combine infrastructure improvements \nwith  reforms  intended  to  make  service  delivery  more  efficient,  sustainable,  and  equitable.  In \nparticular,  it  will  (i)  support  the  establishment  and  promotion  of  ULBs  in  NER,  (ii)  enhance \nefficient  and  self-sustainable  service  delivery  through  the  gradual  introduction  of  dedicated \nservice  delivery  entities  in  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  (iii)  create  sustainable  revenue \nsources by rationalizing service charges and taxes. The NERCCDIP focus will be on operating \nefficiency, sustainability, and accountability rather than pure commercialization or private sector \nprovision  of  infrastructure.  Until  revenue  levels  are  enough  to  cover  O&M  and  asset \ndepreciation and financing costs, private sector participation (PSP) is envisaged to be limited to \neither (i) short-term service contracts, to reduce non-revenue water, among other objectives; or \n(ii) medium-term  management  contracts  for  certain  service  operations,  to  improve  efficiency. \nThe forms and details of PSP will be worked out through a study under the NERCCDIP. \n \n\n                                                 \n22  In  addition  to  the  introduction  of  appropriate  financial  management  systems,  the  activities  may  include,  among \nothers,  energy  and  non-revenue  water  reduction  programs,  environmental  audits,  introduction  of  management \ninformation systems, and quality assurance and quality control. \n\n23  The  civic  awareness  activities  will  stimulate  demand  for  improved  urban  infrastructure  and  services  by \n(i) disseminating  information  on  the  scope  and  nature  of  the  improvements;  (ii)  educating  the  people  on  the  link \nbetween  the  environment  and  health,  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  the  interventions,  and  their  role  in  and \nresponsibility for good environmental practices in solid waste and septic management; and (iii) raising awareness \nof the cost implications of improved services. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n34. \nClimate  Change  Mitigation.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  11th  Plan  objectives  and \nADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020), 24 NERCCDIP  will  seek  to \nidentify  opportunities  for  environmental  improvement  and  climate  change  mitigation.  It  will \ntherefore  promote  improvements  in  urban  sanitation  and  a  reduction  in  fugitive  methane \nemissions by providing treatment systems for sewage and biodegradable waste. Opportunities \nhave  been  identified  and  a  preliminary  assessment  of  carbon  emission  reduction  has  been \nmade to estimate the impact of the proposed composting and wastewater treatment subprojects \nand financing possibilities (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe  cost  of  the  entire  investment  plan  for  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  and \nsolid  waste management  in the five  capital  cities  of  NER for the  next  20 years  is  estimated  at \n$1.1  billion.  Of  this  total,  the  estimated  cost  of  NERCCDIP  is  $285.7  million,  as  shown  in \nsummary  in  Table  1  below.

Section  D14/BP:  Multitranche  Financing  Facility. \nManila),  the  MFF  will  extend  several  loans  to  finance  a  range  of  subprojects  under  NERCCDIP,  subject  to  the \nsubmission of a related periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and the execution of the related loan \nand project agreements. \n\n\f11 \n\nagreement (FFA). A minimum amount of $30 million is proposed for periodic financing requests \n(PFRs). The proposed ADB loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment, consulting \nservices,  and  capacity-building  costs.  All  the  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan \nregulations applicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based loans dated 1 July 2001 \nwill apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included in the loan agreement. \nThe  Government  may  choose  between  eligible  currencies  and  interest  rate  regimes  for  each \nloan. The specific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR, with interest determined \naccording to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facilities. The Government will make the proceeds of \nthe loan available to MOUD and each state, promptly and on terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB, for the implementation of NERCCDIP. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of India and state governments \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nTotal \n200.0  \n85.7  \n285.7  \n\n% \n70.0  \n30.0  \n100.0  \n\n \n37. \nProject 1.

IPCC  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  management  of  NERCCDIP  in  the  five  cities.  This  team  of  at  least \nthree  administrative  and financial, technical,  and  social  and  environmental  officials,  headed  by \nan  investment  program  manager,  will  (i)  prepare  and  submit  consolidated  quarterly  reports  on \nNERCCDIP  implementation  progress  and  other  matters  to  ADB;  (ii)  review  the  compliance  of \nsubprojects  submitted  by  the  states  for  financing  with  subproject  selection  criteria,  and  submit \nPFRs  to  DEA;  (iii)  consolidate  payment  and  reimbursement  requests;  (iv)  coordinate \npolicy-related  activities  and  ensure  that  actions  highlighted  during  the quarterly  NSC  meetings \nare acted on; (v) prepare the overall NERCCDIP implementation plan and consolidated annual \nwork plan; (vi) coordinate training programs and allocations for each of the states; (vii) conduct \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  to  ensure  compliance  with  loan  covenants  and  agreed  targets;  and \n(viii) design and implement NERCCDIP performance management system surveys.  \n \nA state executing agency25 (SEA) in each state will carry out the part of the loan falling \n39. \nunder the state government. In each state a state steering committee (SSC) and an investment \nprogram  empowered  committee  (IPEC)  will  also  be  formed  before  the  loan  takes  effect.  SSC, \nchaired  by  the  chief  secretary,  will  have  the  secretaries  and  heads  of  the  departments \nconcerned as members. It will meet quarterly, review progress, provide policy guidance, advise \non necessary actions (particularly regarding the scope or cost and urban reform agenda of the \nNERCCDIP), and facilitate interagency coordination. The convening officer for the SSC will be \nthe  SEA  secretary  for  NERCCDIP.  IPEC  will  decide  on  matters  related  to  NERCCDIP  that  do \nnot  affect  its  scope  or  cost,  including  financial  and  administrative  approvals,  procurement, \ntenders,  purchases,  staff  recruitment,  post  creation,  consultant  recruitment,  land  acquisition, \nand other similar matters.

For the implementation of \nthe  infrastructure  components,  the  SIPMIU  will  have  a  number  of  small  engineering  cells  with \nstaff appointed by the line departments and ULBs, where applicable. The engineering units will \ndesign,  contract  out,  supervise,  and  administer  work  in  various  sectors  of  NERCCDIP.  There \nwill  also  be  units  to  implement  awareness  campaigns,  consultations  with  affected  persons, \nrehabilitation and resettlement, environmental management, and capacity building and training. \nThe investment program organization chart is in Appendix 5. \n \n42. \nSubproject  Selection  Criteria  and  Implementation  Procedure.  All  subprojects  to  be \nincluded under NERCCDIP will meet the selection criteria stated in the FFA. Each PFR will have \nbeen  technically  prepared,  financially  appraised,  and  processed  in  compliance  with  the \napplicable  social  and  safeguard  frameworks.  The  PFR  will  specify  the  tranche  amount,  the \nconversion  instruments,  the  financing  terms,  the  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  the \nimplementation arrangements, advance contracting, and the amount and purpose of retroactive \nfinancing.27 \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule for the Investment Program  \n\n \nNERCCDIP  will  be  implemented  in  three  tranches  (or  more  if  necessary)  over  7  years \n43. \n(2009\u20132015). Tranching will be based on the subproject selection criteria and on the readiness \nof  subprojects  in  terms  of  land  acquisition  and  safeguard  requirements  for  environment  and \nresettlement,  technical  links  between  components,  and  institutional  capacity.  Tranches  will  be \nsequenced according to the following principles:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nWorks  pertaining  to  emergency  repairs,  and  infrastructure  and  operational \nefficiency  improvements,  will  be taken  up  in  the first  tranche. These  include  the \nrehabilitation  of  water  supply  systems,  e.g.,  reducing  leakage,  introducing  bulk \nand  individual  metering,  raising  awareness  of  water  conservation  and  improved \nsanitation  and  solid  waste  practices,  and  building  capacity.  Tranche  1  will  also \ninclude two subprojects, in water supply and in solid waste management, which \nwill serve as samples for replication in other cities in succeeding tranches. \n\nSubprojects  involving  the  expansion  of  infrastructure  and  services  will  be  taken \nup in the second and third tranches as they require commitments from the states \n(e.g.,  regarding  the  availability  of  water  sources or  suitable  land  with  necessary \nsafeguard  clearances)  and  progress  toward  cost  recovery  for  O&M  to  sustain \nimprovements. \n\n \n44. \nThe NERCCDIP implementation schedule in tranches is presented in Appendix 6 and a \nschedule  for  each  of  the  cities  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  While  the  minimum  contract \nperiod is envisaged to be 2 years, contract packages worth over $7.0 million are envisaged to \nbe implemented over 3 years. The implementation schedule for the tranches will therefore be as \nfollows:  (i)  for  tranche  1,  May  2009\u2013October  2015;  (ii)  for  tranche  2,  March  2010\u2013\nDecember 2013; and (iii) for tranche 3, December 2012\u2013December 2015. \n                                                 \n27  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB,  along  with  the  PFR,  the  summaries  of  feasibility  studies  and  engineering \ndesigns  (as  necessary),  terms  of  reference  for  the  engagement  of  advisers,  the  results  of  any  advance  actions \ntaken, and relevant economic and financial assessments. Each PFR will refer to an attached procurement plan and \nappropriate  safeguard  documents, including safeguard  plans  required  under  the  safeguard  frameworks  prepared \nfor the MFF. Each PFR will confirm that the general understandings under the FFA remain true and will describe \nthe client\u2019s compliance with the undertakings. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n45. \nCivil  Works  and  Goods.  All  procurement  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  the  SIPMIUs \nfor their respective states. Procurement to be financed by the loans under MFF will conform to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding  will  be  used for civil  works  contracts  estimated  at  $5.0  million  or  more,  and for  supply \ncontracts  valued  at  $1.0  million  or  higher.  Civil  works  and  supply  contracts  costing  less  than \nthose  amounts  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding.  Equipment  worth  up  to \n$100,000 will be procured through shopping. Before the start of any procurement under national \ncompetitive  bidding,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  public  procurement  laws  of  the \ncentral and state governments to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The \nfeasibility  of  community  contracting  will  be  examined  for  each  individual  case  for  low-cost \nsanitation and other community works not exceeding $100,000 in value. The procurement plan \nfor the first PFR is in Appendix 7, and a preliminary procurement assessment of the SEAs and a \npreliminary procurement plan for the entire financing facility are in Supplementary Appendixes F \nand G.  \n \n Procurement  packages  will  be  sized  (i)  to  suit  the  particular  nature  of  the  works \n46. \ninvolved,  (ii)  to  allow  reasonable  competition  in  the  bidding,  and  (iii)  to  optimize  contract \nadministration  and  management  by  the  SIPMIUs,  and  enable  gradual  capacity  building.  The \nprocurement  packages\u2014indicative  other  than  for  the  first  tranche\u2014will  be  further  elaborated \nand updated annually by the SIPMIUs for approval by ADB. On the basis of an assessment of \nthe states\u2019 procurement capacity and experience during the implementation of the first tranche, \nADB will review the contract packages under succeeding tranches. \n\n \nAdvance  Action  and  Retroactive  Financing.  Under  each  MFF  loan,  advance \n47. \ncontracting of civil works, equipment and materials, and consultants may be requested, subject \nto  eligibility  according  to  the  agreed  procedures  and  guidelines  indicated  above.  Except  as \notherwise agreed with ADB, expenditures incurred for civil works, equipment and materials, and \nconsulting services that are eligible for advance contracting qualify for retroactive financing of up \nto 20% of the proposed amount of the loan, for eligible expenditures in each category incurred \nbefore  loan  effectiveness  but  no  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan \nagreement.  \n\n    \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nDesign,  construction  supervision,  and  management  consultants \n\n48. \n(DSMCs)  and \ninstitutional  development  consultants  (IDCs)  will  be  hired  by  each  of  the  five  SIPMIUs, \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nEach  state  DSMC  team  will  be  headed  by  urban  development  and  municipal  engineering \nspecialists  with  experience  in  India  and  abroad.  The  team  will  (i)  support  the  SIPMIUs  in \nidentifying,  preparing,  and  appraising  subprojects;  (ii)  ensure  compliance  with  the  subproject \nselection criteria, as well as the safeguards and other policy requirements and guidelines of the \ncentral  and  state  governments  and  ADB;  (iii)  undertake  detailed  surveys  and  investigations, \nprepare  detailed  engineering  designs,  technical  specifications,  and  procurement  and  contract \ndocuments,  and  supervise  construction  according  to  established  good  practices;  (iv) support \ntechnical evaluation during the tender process and supervise the construction of the NERCCDIP \ninvestments;  and  (v)  support  the  SIPMIU  in  program  management,  awareness  and  public \nrelations activities, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, technical capacity building \nprograms, etc. The IDCs will support the SIPMIUs and government agencies (particularly ULBs \nand,  where  relevant,  parastatals)  in  (i)  implementing the  institutional, financial,  regulatory,  and \noperational  reform  agenda;  (ii)  conducting  capacity-building  programs  to  improve  asset \n\n\f15 \n\nmanagement;  and  (iii)  updating  action  plans  and  strategies  to  meet  the  reform  objectives. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  in  each  of  the  SIPMIUs  are  in \nSupplementary Appendixes H and I. \n \nThe  IPCC  will  be  supported  by  a  team  of  program  management  and  monitoring \n49. \nfinance  and  management \nconsultants  (PMMCs),  comprising  urban  management  and \ninformation  systems  specialists,  and  headed  by  an  urban  development  and  municipal \nengineering expert with extensive experience. The central PMMC team will (i) support the IPCC \nin MOUD in program coordination by monitoring and reporting regularly on progress, identifying \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  and  recommending  corrective  actions;  (ii)  review  subproject \nappraisal  reports  prepared  by  the  SIPMIUs,  and  support  the  IPCC  in  preparing  PFRs  for \nsubmission  to  DEA;  and  (iii)  support  IPCC  in  capacity  building.  The  consultants  will  also  be \nrequired  to  assist  the  IPCC  in  implementing  the  urban  reform  plan  and  undertaking  relevant \nstudies,  establishing  systems,  and  preparing  strategy  and  action  plans  for  the  solid  waste \nmanagement  and  PSP  packages.  The  services  of  both  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nand  community-based  organizations  are  also  likely  to  be  needed  to  support  civic  awareness \nraising,  community-level  solid  waste  management,  and  resettlement  monitoring.  Outline  terms \nof reference for the PMMC services are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n50. \nIt  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  1,985  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  in \nproject  management  and  in  design  and  construction  supervision,  and  549 person-months  of \nnational  expertise  in  institutional  development,  will  be  required  over  the  NERCCDIP  period.28 \nThe  specific  number  of  consultants  deployed  at  any  point  in  time  will  depend  on  the  work \nrequirements,  but  it  is  estimated  that,  on  average,  5\u20136  consultants  will  be  deployed  at  the \ncentral  IPCC  and  10\u201312  consultants  in  each  of  the  five  state  DSMCs  at  any  one  time.  For \nconsulting  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  and  above,  the  selection  will  be  quality-  and \ncost-based.  For  consulting  contracts  below  that  amount,  least-cost  selection  or  individual \nrecruitment will be followed. The need for consulting services is expected to decline gradually as \nSEAs gain more capacity during implementation, and will be reviewed during the MFF midterm \nreview.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n51. \nwith  the  Government  and  states.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  examine  and  review,  directly  or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nInvestment  Program.  In  this  regard,  investigation  of  government  officials,  if  any,  would  be \nrequested  by  ADB  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Investment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  NERCCDIP  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program  \n \nTo supplement the policy, these following specific measures are included: (i) information \n52. \ntechnology  will  be  used  to  increase  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency,  through \n(a) public  disclosure  of NERCCDIP  information through government  and  program  websites  (to \nbe prepared), and (b) an expedited program of e-governance in the states; (ii) communities will \nparticipate in state steering committee decisions, and the minutes of meetings will be disclosed \n                                                 \n28  In  addition,  support  staff  will  be  hired  for  project  management,  design,  and  construction  supervision \n\n(1,386 person-months), and for services in support of the IDCs (640 person-months). \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nto  the  public  through  the  program  webpage;  (iii)  independent  procurement  and  performance \naudits,  commissioned  by  MOUD,  will  be  carried  out  as  often  as  necessary,  and  at  least  once \nbefore the NERCCDIP midterm review; (iv) fiduciary issues will be reviewed; and (v) the Right to \nInformation Act 2005 (RTI Act), the Prevention of Corruption Act (1998), and the Service Rules \nand  Codes  of  Conduct  of  Public  Officials  will  be  strictly  applied  in  all  the  five  states,  thus \nempowering  departments  to  investigate  the  conduct  of  their  officials,  and  to  investigate \nallegations  of  corruption,  through  internal  vigilance  offices  or  state  equivalents  of  the  Central \nBureau of Investigation, and take legal action if required. \n \n\nDisbursement \n\n6. \n \n53. \nLoans  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Immediately  after  the  first  loan  takes  effect,  the  Government  will \nopen and maintain a first-generation imprest account (FGIA) in the account of the controller of \naid accounts and audit of the Reserve Bank of India in Delhi to ensure the timely release of loan \nproceeds  and  expedite  implementation.  The  FGIA  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars.  Imprest \naccounts will be opened separately for each PFR.29 The advance to be paid into the FGIA will \nbe  equivalent  to  6  months\u2019  estimated  expenditure  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower.  The  initial  advance  or  replenishment  by  ADB  into  the  FGIA  will  be  converted  into \nequivalent rupees by the controller of aid accounts and audit according to Reserve Bank policy, \nand transferred in rupees to each of the states through the budget. \n \n54. \nConcurrently,  second-generation  imprest  accounts  (SGIAs)  may  be  opened  in  a \ncommercial bank by the governments of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura, \nsubject to the commitment by each of these governments and urban departments, as SEAs, to \nadhere  to  ADB  procedures  for  operating  the  SGIA.  The  governments  will  assure  ADB  that  all \nADB  disbursements  for  imprest  advance  or  replenishment  will  be  passed  on  to  urban \ndevelopment departments for deposit into the commercial-bank SGIAs within 30 calendar days \nof receipt of the advance or replenishment from ADB. The amount to be deposited initially into \neach  SGIA  account  will  not  exceed  the  state\u2019s  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of \nprogram implementation or 10% of the loan amount allocated to the state, whichever is lower. \nThe  SIPMIUs  will  warrant  that  funds  in  each  of  the  SGIAs  will  be  used  only  to  fund  eligible \nexpenditures  according  to  the  terms  of  the  loan  agreements  and  to  meet  the  immediate \nshort-term  disbursement  requirements  of  the  loans.  Both  the  FGIA  and  the  SGIA  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated according to the guidelines in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  The  NERCCDIP  funds  flowchart  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  statement  of  expenditures \n(SOE) procedure will be adopted in reimbursing and liquidating SGIAs for eligible expenditures \nnot exceeding $100,000 per payment.  \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n7. \n \nThe  IPCC  and  each  of  the  SIPMIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  for  each \n55. \nPFR  according  to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  for  all  NERCCDIP  expenditures, \nwhether funded out of loan proceeds or other sources. Separate records will be established and \nmaintained for works, goods, and services financed out of loan proceeds.  \n \n56. \nThe  central  and  state  governments  will  cause  their  respective  project  accounts,  as \nmaintained  by  the  IPCC  and  the  SIPMIUs,  to  be  audited  by  independent  auditors,  whose \nqualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  must  be  acceptable  to  ADB.  State \ngovernments  will  submit  their  audited  accounts  to  MOUD  for  endorsement  and  further \n\n                                                 \n29  Charges associated with opening and maintaining imprest accounts will be financed by the Government.  \n\n\f17 \n\nsubmission to ADB within 9 months of the end of the fiscal year.30 This period will be reviewed \nduring the midterm and may be subsequently reduced to 6 months. The annual audit report will \ninclude  the  audit  of  the  central  imprest  account,  the  SGIA,  and  the  SOE  procedure,  and  will \nspecifically  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds, the  operation  of \nthe SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures. MOUD and the states have been made aware \nof  ADB\u2019s  policy  regarding  delayed  submission,  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  satisfactory  and \nacceptable audited accounts. \n \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Review    \n\n8. \n \n57. \nIPCC  in  MOUD  will  establish  an  investment  program  performance  monitoring  system \nacceptable  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan  under  MFF,  including \n(i) data  collection  and  reporting  procedures;  (ii)  performance  indicators  relating  to  physical \ninfrastructure, capacity development, and program management support, including those in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  (for  individual  loans  and  the  overall  NERCCDIP);  and \n(iii) corresponding  target  dates,  including  those  for  institutional  and  financial  reforms  and \ncapacity building. The IPCC will help the SIPMIUs set baseline values for each of the indicators \nand conduct annual surveys to update these baseline values. \n \n58. \nThe IPCC will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports informing ADB of overall MFF \nprogress (subproject and tranche preparation and approval) and the implementation progress of \nongoing  individual  loans.  The  reports  should  consolidate  the  quarterly  reports  prepared \nseparately  by  the  SIPMIUs  and  provide  summary  financial  accounts  of  NERCCDIP,  including \n(i) a  summary  financial  account  for  each  of  the  states,  (ii)  expenditures  to  date,  (iii)  a  benefit \nmonitoring  report,  and  (iv)  a  safeguard  compliance  report.  Within  3  months  of  the  physical \ncompletion  of  each  loan,  the  IPCC  will  also  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  covering  the \ndetails of project implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation, safeguard compliance, and \nother  information  requested  by  ADB.  An  ADB  program  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  soon \nafter  MFF  approval,  and  regular  review  missions  for  each  loan  will  be  held  at  least  every \n6 months. In addition, an MFF midterm review will be conducted in 2012 for NERCCDIP. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n\n59. \nNERCCDIP  consists  of  13  clearly  defined  projects  in  the  five  states,  which  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  with  several  sequenced  loans.  All  13  projects  were  appraised  by  ADB \ndue-diligence missions. A \u201cproject economic analysis\u201d for each of the 13 projects was therefore \ndeemed  appropriate.31 The  economic  analysis  covered  (i)  the  macroeconomic  context,  (ii)  the \nsector  context,  (iii)  the  justification  for  public  intervention,  (iv)  demand  analysis,  (v)  the  project \nrationale, (vi) project alternatives, and (vii) project costs and benefits. The development of basic \nurban  infrastructure  in  NER  supports  the  Government\u2019s  economic  policies,  such  as  the  \u201clook \neast\u201d policy of establishing closer economic relations with the rest of South Asia and with East \n\n                                                 \n30  This exceptional consideration, based on ADB. 2001. Project Administration Instructions. PAI 5.09: Submission of \nAudited  Project  Accounts  and  Financial  Statements.  Manila  (revised  January  2009,  para.  17),  is  dictated  by  the \nlarge number of stakeholders involved, the weak capacity of the five SEAs, and the need to introduce both SEAs \nand the NEA to ADB\u2019s requirements.     \n\n31 Since  this  is  a project loan,  the  scope  of this  economic  analysis  is  governed  by  ADB.  2006. Operations  Manual. \nSection  F1/BP:  Environmental  Considerations  in  ADB  Projects.

Affordability assessment is a part of ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. \nManila (Section 4.3.3.5.5), and was therefore done in the financial analysis. Project sustainability was assessed by \nestimating the financial internal rate of return in the financial analysis. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nthat \n\nThe \n\nfinancial  management  assessment  revealed \n\nFinancial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis \n\nAsia through the NER, and a number of regional trading agreements since 1992. The economic \nrationale  for  government  intervention  is  justified,  since  all  the  projects  support  basic  public \nservices,  with  monopolistic  conditions,  externality  management,  and  impact  on  income \ndistribution. Targeting less-developed regions like the NER supports the 11th Plan objective of \n\u201cfaster  and  more  inclusive  growth,\u201d  given  the  increasing  disparities  between  states,  between  \nregions  within  states,  between  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  between  various  sectors  of  the \ncommunity, resulting from inequitable share in growth.  \n \n60. \nThe  projects  are  intended  to  (i)  overcome  gaps  between  service  demand  and  supply, \nand  (ii) reduce  the  cost  associated  with  providing  inadequate  services.  An  emphasis  on \nincreasing efficiency in infrastructure and systems has given rise to least-cost designs for each \nproject.  All  the  projects  demonstrate  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  above  the \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  about  12%;  all  are  therefore  economically  viable.  The \nsensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRRs are sensitive to a reduction in the realized benefits \nand that the planned coverage of services must be achieved to realize higher economic benefits. \nThe economic analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nB. \n \n61. \nthe  asset  owners,  after \nconstruction,  will  not  have  enough  operating  income  to  meet  operating  expenses.  To  improve \ntheir financial base, there will be a need for institutional reforms including (i) property tax base \nincrease, reassessment, mapping, and computerization; (ii) a gradual increase in user charges; \nand  (iii)  improvements  in  collection  efficiency.  An  indicative  financial  improvement  action  plan \nfor achieving these reforms, which the state governments in the NER have approved, is shown \nin the financial analysis (Supplementary Appendix M). It provides specific figures for introducing \nnew user charges, increasing tariffs, widening service coverage, and improving tariff collection \nefficiency. State agencies and ULBs now use cash-basis accounting, which does not provide an \naccurate  picture  of  their  assets  (including  receivables)  and  liabilities.  Further,  asset  recording, \nphysical  verification,  and  reconciliation  with  records  is  not  kept  current  because  staff  are \noverworked  and  also  lack  the  necessary  skills.  To  strengthen  financial  management  capacity \nand  work  efficiency,  accountants  from  relevant  state  departments  and  asset  owners  will  be \ntrained \ninformation  management  and  reporting,  accrual-based \ndouble-entry accounting, and the use of information technology.  \n \n62. \nThe financial sustainability of all 13 projects was assessed according to ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement  and  analysis  procedures. 32  For  revenue-generating  sectors\u2014water  supply, \nsewerage, and solid waste management\u2014incremental revenue and cost due to the subprojects \nwere  estimated  on  a  with-project  and  a  without-project  basis.  To  meet  the  objective  of  the \nfinancial  improvement  action  plan  of  achieving  full  O&M  cost  recovery  within  the  NERCCDIP \nimplementation  period,  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  solid  waste  management  tariffs  must  be \nincreased.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  ranges  from  3.1%  to  14.7%  for  water \nsupply projects, is negative for all sewerage projects, and ranges from 3.0% to 41.7% for solid \nwaste  management  projects.  Water  supply  and  solid  waste  management  have  an  estimated \nFIRR  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.88%.  Despite  the  negative  FIRR  for  all \nsewerage projects, revenues will cover O&M expenditures. Sensitivity analysis shows generally \nrobust FIRRs, showing them to be highly sensitive to an increase in revenue. In other words, to \nobtain desirable returns on investment, coverage and revenue must increase. \n\nin  budgeting, \n\nfinancial \n\n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2005.

Safe  drinking  water  is  a  basic  need, \nyet it is not easily accessible to significant numbers of poor people in the cities. NERCCDIP will \nreduce  the  burden  of  water  collection  now  placed  on  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population, \nparticularly the women. Free water connections and lifeline tariffs will enable the poor to afford \ndrinking water. Improvements in sewage treatment, sanitation, and solid waste management will \nlead to public health improvements, resulting in a reduced burden of disease\u2014treatment costs \nand  productivity  losses\u2014experienced  to  a  higher  degree  by  the  poor.  Low-cost  sanitation \nfacilities will be pilot-tested in poor areas, and waste collection will be undertaken through NGOs \nin  slums  and  poor  neighborhoods  that  are  inaccessible  to  vehicles.  Program  components  will \nalso  create  jobs  for  the  poor.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n64.  Women\u2019s  issues  were  considered  in  the  program  design.  Stakeholders  involved  in \nwomen  and  gender  affairs,  e.g.,  female  councilors,  self-help  groups,  NGOs,  and  other \ninstitutions,  were  consulted.  Because  of  women\u2019s  primary  role  in  household  management  and \nwater  collection,  the  lack  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  has  greater  impact  on \nwomen\u2014their health, well-being, and participation in productive activities\u2014than it has on men. \nNERCCDIP will have a major positive impact on women. A gender action plan (Supplementary \nAppendix  N)  will  further  mainstream  gender  issues  in  subproject  design,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring. \n \nD. \n \nSocial. The Program is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impact. \n65. \nRehabilitation subprojects will be carried out within the existing facilities\u2019 premises and will not \ninvolve  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Subprojects  involving  the  construction  of  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  sewerage  systems,  and  solid  waste  management  improvements  are \nproposed  on government  land  wherever  possible. The  overall  impact  will  be further minimized \nthrough  careful  subproject  siting  and  alignment  during  detailed  design  and  subproject \nimplementation.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \nrequirements for involuntary resettlement, a resettlement framework was prepared on the basis \nof  national  laws\u2014the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  (amended  in  1984)  and  the  National \nRehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy  of  2007\u2014as  well  as  state  laws  and  regulations33 and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995, as amended from time to time). The resettlement \nframework,  outlining  the  objectives,  policy  principles,  and  procedures  of  land  acquisition  (if \nrequired),  compensation,  and  other  assistance  measures  for  affected  persons,  will  guide  the \nimplementation of subprojects. The resettlement framework is summarized in Appendix 10 and \npresented in full in Supplementary Appendix O. Resettlement plans based on the resettlement \nframework  will  be  prepared  for  program  subprojects.  Subprojects  with  significant34 impact  will \nrequire  full  resettlement  plans,  while  subprojects  with  insignificant  impact  will  require  short \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n                                                 \n33  The relevant state laws are: (i) for Agartala: the Tripura Municipal Act of 1994 and the Tripura Land Revenue and \nLand Reform Act of 1960; (ii) for Aizawl: the Mizoram Prevention of Government Land Encroachment Act of 2001 \nand the Mizoram Urban and Regional Development Act of 1990; (iii) for Gangtok, the Sikkim Urban and Regional \nPlanning Development Act of 1998 and the Sikkim Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act of 1977; (iv) for Kohima, \nthe  Nagaland  Land  (Requisition  and  Acquisition)  Act  of  1965,  the  Nagaland  Eviction of Persons  in  Unauthorized \nOccupation of Public Land Act of 1971, the Nagaland (Ownership and Transfer of Its Land Resource) Act of 1990, \nand the Nagaland Town and Country Planning Act of 1966; and (v) foor Shillong: the Meghalaya Town and Country \nPlanning Act of 1973. \n\n34 Resettlement  is  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impact.  The  impact  is  major  when  it \nphysically  displaces  the  affected  people  from  housing  or  causes  them  to  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive, \nincome-generating assets. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plans  will  ensure  that  the  socioeconomic  conditions, \nneeds,  and  priorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  recognized  and  that  the  process  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage vulnerable groups.  \n \n66. \nIn all cities, initial screening for impact on indigenous peoples showed no impact. In the \nurban  program  areas  of Agartala,  Aizawl,  and  Gangtok,  where  scheduled  tribes  do  not form  a \nmajority of the population, the groups are no different from other groups in their social, cultural, \neconomic,  and  political  characteristics.  In  Kohima  and  Shillong,  where  scheduled  tribes  are \nstrongly  attached  to  natural  resources,  habitats,  and  ancestral  territories,  they  compose  the \nmainstream or dominant society, and the urban areas are socially, culturally, economically, and \npolitically  homogeneous.  NERCCDIP  will  result  in  environmental  and  public  health  benefits for \nthe whole program population. The likelihood that subprojects will affect indigenous peoples is \nsmall;  resettlement  plans  address  the  likely  impact.  Further,  subproject  design  prioritizes \nrehabilitation over new construction of basic social infrastructure, avoiding land acquisition and \nconsequent  resettlement,  and  subproject  siting  in  built-up  areas.  An  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  framework  (IPDF)  has  been  formulated  (Supplementary  Appendix  Q)  to  ensure \nthat appropriate indigenous peoples development plans or specific actions enable equal sharing \nof NERCCDIP benefits should a future subproject have impact on indigenous peoples. \n \n67. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  NERCCDIP  is  designed to  improve  environmental quality \nand  living  conditions  in  urban  areas  through  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) show that net subproject environmental benefits are positive \nand  extensive,  and  include  (i) reduced  water  pollution  as  a result  of  investments  in  sanitation, \nsewage treatment, and municipal solid waste management facilities; (ii) increased availability of \npotable  water  at  appropriate  pressure  from  water  supply  subprojects;  (iii)  better  public  health, \nincluding  reduced  waterborne  and  infectious  diseases,  through  improvements  in  water  supply \nand sewage treatment, and municipal solid waste management investments; and (iv) improved \naesthetics from the improvement of sewage treatment and municipal solid waste works. \n \nThe  potential  negative  environmental  impact  is  mostly  localized  and  temporary,  and \n68. \nmostly  related  to  dust,  noise,  and  disruptions  in  access  due  to  construction  activities  and \nconstruction-related  waste  disposal.  Such  impact  can  largely  be  avoided  through  proper \nsubproject  design  (particularly  in  siting),  or  mitigated  through  proper  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental management (Appendix 11).  \n \n69. \nEnvironmental  subproject  selection  criteria  will  further  ensure  that  any  adverse \nenvironmental impact is not significant or permanent. An environmental assessment and review \nframework  has  been  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  policies,  guidelines,  and \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects (Supplementary Appendix R).  \n \nE. \n \n70. \nThe  main  risks  identified  are:  (i)  potential  public  resistance  to  water  metering,  (ii)  low \nconnectivity for the sewerage component, (iii) lack of state actions to implement the institutional \nand  financial  reform  agenda,  (iv)  public  refusal  to  pay  for  the  services,  and  (v)  slow  program \nimplementation  due  to  the  states\u2019  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures  and  the  difficulties \nassociated with acquiring land for subproject implementation. NERCCDIP will mitigate the risks \nthrough  a  number  of  measures.  Civic  awareness  programs  will  stimulate  demand  for  the \nimproved services and make the public more willing to pay the higher tariffs. Regulations will be \nissued  to  enforce  connection  to  improved  services.  The  risk  of  destruction  from  earthquakes \nand landslips was addressed at the feasibility stage through the mapping of earthquake faults, \n\nRisks \n\n\f21 \n\nslip  lines,  and  landslip  hazard  areas  and  the  design  of  the  various  components  to  include \nprotection  from  damage.  Other  measures  building  on  the  initial  designs  (such  as  detailed \ngeotechnical surveys) will be incorporated during detailed design. \n \n71. \nNERCCDIP  assumes  (i)  a  stable  political  environment  and  positive  economic  growth, \nand  (ii)  a  commitment  by  all  institutions  (modern  and  traditional)  to  participate  actively  in \nplanning and development. SIPMIUs will regularly brief ADB on the progress of each package, \nimmediately  highlighting any  security-related  disruption. The following  mitigation measures  will \nbe  implemented:  (i)  careful  and  continuous  monitoring  of  security  developments;  (ii)  balanced \nrecruitment of qualified staff from within and outside the states; (iii) complete participatory and \ntransparent implementation, including the disclosure of financial information; (iv) mobilization of \nstrong community support and trust in project staff; and (v) encouragement of local employment, \npossibly through joint ventures. \n \n72. \nThe  risk  of  slow  program  implementation  is  being  addressed  from  several  angles, \nincluding  (i) the  early  training  of  program  directors  and  other  key  SIPMIU  staff  in  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  early  support  through  the  ongoing  project  implementation  and  capacity \ndevelopment  TA,35 (iii)  the  early  appointment  of  project  management  consultants,  and  (iv)  the \nproposed establishment of an ADB extension office in the NER.  \n \n\nA. \n\nFramework Financing Agreement Undertakings \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n\n73. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government of India and the governments of \nthe states have given the following assurances, which will be incorporated into the FFA as well \nas  the  individual  loan  and  project  agreements  as  applicable,  subject  to  any  amendment  to  be \nmutually  agreed  on  by  ADB,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state \ngovernments, on the other. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government of India will ensure that the facility funds are utilized effectively \nand efficiently to implement NERCCDIP and achieve its objectives.  \nStates will implement the urban institutional, finance, regulatory, and operational \nreform program (Appendix 12) in accordance with the time frame set in the action \nplan. \nEmpowered  committees  and  SIPMIUs,  headed  and  staffed  by  officers  with \nsuitable  qualifications  and  experience  who  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  in \nplace in each state throughout NERCCDIP. \nThe  Government  of  India  and  the  states  will  ensure  that  adequate  funds  are \nprovided to meet any shortfall in financing for the O&M of assets created under \nNERCCDIP. \nPrior to any investment in the augmentation of water supply in any of the capital \ncities, the city concerned will have approved a plan for increased investments in \nsewerage and sanitation. \nThe Government of India and the states will ensure that all land and right-of-way \nrequired  for  NERCCDIP  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  adequate \ncompensation is provided prior to the signing of the relevant civil works contracts, \nand  involuntary  resettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework and the resettlement plans agreed on by the Government of India and \nADB, the Government\u2019s National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation, and \n\n                                                 \n35  ADB. 2006.

A resettlement plan will be \nprepared  for  each  subproject  that  involves  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  and \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval prior to the award of any related civil \nworks  contracts.  For  sample  subprojects,  updated  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprovided  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  following  detailed  design  and  prior  to \nthe award of civil works contracts. \nThe  Government  of  India  and  the  states  will  ensure  that  all  subproject  facilities \nare  designed,  constructed,  operated,  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nfor  core \nenvironmental  assessment  and \nsubcomponents  agreed  on  by  the  Government  of  India  and  ADB,  and  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy  (2002).  Any  adverse  environmental  impact  arising  from  the  construction, \noperation,  and  implementation  of  subcomponent  facilities  will  be  minimized \nthrough  environmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and  other \nrecommendations  specified  in  the  environmental  assessment  reports  (e.g., \nIEEs). The Government of India will ensure that environmental requirements are \nincorporated in the bidding documents and civil works contracts. Bid documents \nwill be issued after review and clearance of the IEE or the environmental impact \nassessment by ADB and the state environmental impact assessment authority or \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests.  The  Government  of  India  will  prepare \nand  submit  annually  to  ADB  an  environmental  monitoring  report  that  describes \nprogress  in  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and  the \nenvironmental assessment and review plan, issues encountered, and measures \nadopted, and compliance with the relevant assurances and loan covenants.  \n(viii)  The  Government  of  India  and  the  states  will  ensure  that  subprojects  do  not \nnegatively  impact  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  indigenous  peoples.  In  the  event \nthat indigenous peoples are involved in any of the subprojects, the Government \nand the states will ensure that the subprojects are carried out in accordance with \nthe  IPDF  agreed  on  by  the  Government  of  India  and  the  states  and  ADB,  with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and India's and the States' laws and \nregulations. \nThe Government of India and the states will ensure that all civil works contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, including those on occupational health and \nsafety, equal pay for men and women for work of equal value, and do not employ \nchild  labor  as  defined  in  national  legislation  for  construction  and  maintenance \nactivities. \nThe  states  will  take  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures  to  encourage \nadequate representation of all sections of society in ULBs. \nIn  cities  receiving  funds  from  the  water  and  sewerage  facility,  the  state  or  the \nULB  in  charge  of  service  delivery  will  make  information  on  water  and  affluent \ntesting publicly available. \nThe Government of India and the states will comply with the gender action plan \nagreed on by the Government and ADB. \n\n(xii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n(xiii)  The Government of India and the states will ensure that all subprojects meet, to \nthe  satisfaction  of  ADB,  the  selection

The  five  states  share  an  international  boundary  with    Bangladesh,  Bhutan, \n1. \nPRC,  Nepal,  and  Myanmar.  They  are  often  hilly,  landlocked,  and  far  from  mainland  markets. \nTheir economies are largely agrarian. Urbanization rates range from 11% to 50%. By 2027, the \nurban  population  of the states  is  estimated  to  be  30%  of their total  population.  Urbanization  is \ndominated by the capital cities, which account for over 60% of the total urban population. The \nlargest cities are Agartala (Tripura) and Shillong (Meghalaya), with populations of over 300,000. \nAizawl  (Mizoram)  has  230,000  people,  Kohima  (Nagaland)  120,000,  and  Gangtok  (Sikkim) \n90,000. The cities had high annual growth rates in the past (over 5%); future growth rates are \nestimated to range from 1.8% to 3%.  \n \n2. \nWater  and  Sanitation  Coverage  and  Service  Levels.  The  development  potential \ncreated by increasing connectivity and a productive labor force in the capital cities is hampered \nby  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  Coverage  is  limited  to  a  reduced  number  of \nbeneficiaries:  the  percentage  of the  population  with  access to  piped  water  supply  ranges from \n50%  to  80%.1  All  of  the  cities  have  a  tropical  monsoon  climate,  with  rainfall  that  ranges  from \n2,000 mm (Kohima) to 3,500 mm (Gangtok) per year. There are, however, marked differences \nin rainfall during the year, with a rainy season from June to November and a dry season the rest \nof the  year,  when  water shortages  are more  acute.  Non-revenue  water (NRW)  levels  are  high \n(ranging in most cities from 40% to 60%), water is supplied for 2\u20134 hours a day, schemes are \noften stretched beyond their design life resulting in operational deficiencies,2 and service does \nnot  meet  the  required  standards.3  Where  pipe-borne  drinking  water  is  not  available,  water  is \ngenerally  sourced  from  private  or  public  streams,  dug  or  tube  wells,  public  tanks,  ponds,  and \nchannels; however, the quality of extracted water is often compromised and seldom verified. In \naddition  to  limited  access,  water  supplies  are  usually  insufficient,  particularly  at  the  end  of the \ndry season. Demand and willingness to pay for water and sanitation are nonetheless reasonably \nhigh.4 \n \n3. \nAll  five  capital  cities  present  size  and  densities  where  sanitation  is  a  problem.  In  all \ncities,  the  dominant  mode  of  sanitation  is  a  septic  tank  or  soak  pit  for  toilet  wastes,  with \nwastewaters  that  percolate  into  the  soil  and  an  overflow  to  the  nearest  drain  or  stream,  while \nsullage wastes drain directly into the nearest drain or stream. Only Gangtok has a central piped \n                                                 \n1  Agartala\u2019s  coverage  is  around  70%,  Aizawl\u2019s  around  50%,  Gangtok\u2019s  around  80%,  Kohima\u2019s  50%  (of  which  half \ndepends on stand-post supplies), and Shillong\u2019s around 50% (but only about 44% have taps in their dwellings). \n2   Agartala\u2019s  production  system  is  reportedly  operating  at  50%  of  the  total  capacity,  and  Aizawl\u2019s  at  about  50%. \nGangtok  is operating  at 40% of  its  treatment  capacity  (lower  if  abstraction levels  are considered).  In  the  case  of \nKohima, the treatment plant is not operating at present.  \n\n3   In all instances, water pressures are also below the recommended 7 meters at the consumer outlet. Water quality \nis,  in  many  instances,  not  monitored  often  enough  (in  Kohima,  samples  are  only  occasionally  taken  and  sent  to \nDimapur  for  analysis;  in  Shillong,  many  of  the  tests  are  done  off-plant;  in  Agartala,  iron  concentrations  are \nsometimes above  recommended  levels)  and does  not  always  meet  the  water  quality  standards  of  the  Bureau  of \nIndian Standards and the World Health Organization (WHO).  \n\n4   Lack of adequate water supplies has created severe hardship for the population of all five cities and hampered the \ndevelopment  of  the  cities.  In  Agartala,  particularly  in  older  parts  of  town,  distribution  pipes  are  blocked  by  iron \ndeposits,  and  supplies  are  restricted.  In  Aizawl  and  Kohima,  where  production  capacity  is  substantially  below \ndemand, and the distribution system pipelines are old and inadequate, water may be available for only a few hours \na week during the dry season. In Kohima, the shortages are so severe that private operators have begun providing \npiped  water  supplies  in  competition  with  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department.  Gangtok  and  Shillong  have \nrecently  improved  their  water  production  capacity,  but  neither  city  has  carried  out  the  distribution  system \nimprovements  needed  to  serve  the  population  better.  Although  some  of  the  traditional  dorbars  (tribal  villages) \nsurrounding Shillong operate their own piped water supply systems, these are now under pressure from population \ngrowth  and  limited  sources.  Gangtok  is  perhaps  the  most  advanced  of  the  five  cities  in  water  supply  services, \nbecause  of  its  access  to  a  substantially  large  source  of  water  and  the  introduction  of  certain  operational  and \nmanagement improvements. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nsewer system of substantial size, but even there the present system caters to only about 12% of \nthe population.5 In Kohima, a small piped sewerage system providing only basic treatment has \nbeen constructed by the residents of Chota Basti slum community. On average, about 95% of \nthe  population  in  program  cities  has  access  to  a  toilet  at  home  or  a  shared  toilet.6  In  Agartala \nand Aizawl, most households have a toilet in their dwelling, whereas in Gangtok, Kohima, and \nShillong  a  fraction  share  toilets.  About  5%  of  households  have  no  access  to  a  toilet  in  the \ndwelling or shared with others, and use either public toilets or defecate in the open. About 19% \nof  toilets  are  pit  latrines  or  dry  toilets;  therefore,  about  24%  of  the  population  of  the  program \ncities  use  pit  latrines,  dry  toilets,  or  open  fields  and  streams.  About  72%  of  households  have \nseptic tanks or soak pits. On average, about 26% of households have their septic tanks or soak \npits  emptied  by  vacuum  trucks,  while  the  rest  empty  them  manually.  It  is  common  practice  to \ndump the wastes into the nearest stream or drain.7 \n \n \nAlthough the levels vary, it is estimated that only 30%\u201350% of solid waste generated is \n4. \ncollected. Despite efforts, service is limited in low-income areas, slums, and inaccessible areas \nincluding  those  with  steep,  hilly  terrain.  Biodegradable  wastes  are  not  segregated  from \nnonbiodegradable wastes; the latter often contain biomedical and industrial hazardous wastes. \nNo  storage  bins  are  provided;  waste  generated  accumulates  at  the  roadside.  Manual \nmulti-handling  of  waste  continues  through  manual  loading  of  waste  into  refuse  vehicles. \nSanitation  workers,  at  high  risk  to  their  health,  often  do  not  use  personal  protective  gear  like \ngloves  dust masks. The  transport fleet  is  often  insufficient  in  capacity,  vehicles  are  uncovered \nand  old,  and  parking  and  garage  facilities  are  not  available.  None  of  the  cities  have  compost \nfacilities  except  for  Gangtok  and  Shillong,  and  even  in  these  towns  compost  marketing  is  a \nproblem. No sanitary landfills are available in any of the five program cities. Crude dumping and \nburning of waste is still common. \n \n5. \nWater  and  Sanitation  Sector  Governance  and  Financial  Performance. Deficiencies \nin  urban  systems,  management,  and  finance  are  responsible  for  the  poor  infrastructure  and \nservice provision. Urban local bodies (ULBs) are still at an early stage of development. Among \nthe five cities, only Agartala has a fully functioning ULB. Existing and emerging ULBs in Shillong \nand Agartala at this point are mostly in solid waste management, minor roads, drains, and water \nsupply.  In  Kohima,  12th  Schedule  functions  have  only  partially  been  included  in  the  state \nMunicipal  Act  and transferred to  the  ULB,  whereas  in  Aizawl  and Gangtok,  the functions  have \nfor  the  most  part  been  incorporated  in  the  Municipal  Acts  but  are  still  held  by  the  parastatal \nagencies.8  The  situation  is  further  complicated  by  conflicting  legislation  and  traditional \ngovernance  structures  with  overlapping  jurisdictions,  resulting  in  poor  service  delivery.  The \noperation and maintenance of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services is generally the duty \nof  public  health  and  engineering  departments,  but  these  are  traditionally  oriented  to \ninfrastructure  building  and  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  deliver  good  service.  Overly  complex \n\n                                                 \n5   The sewerage system in Gangtok suffers from several problems. One of these is lack of connectivity. Connections \nare difficult to make, given the mountainous terrain. Houses above the sewer line are relatively easy to connect, \nwhile  those  immediately  below  the  sewer  line  often  must  connect  farther  down  the  hillside.  Households  are  not \nrequired to connect to the sewer system. The main outfall line is badly deteriorated and leaking; the bottom of the \npipe has been eroded by the mix of high velocities, and the joints are of poor quality or damaged. The treatment \nplant is soon to be replaced. \n\n6   Toilet coverage in 2006 was 98% in Mizoram, 97% in Tripura, 86% in Nagaland, 71% in Meghalaya, and 89% in \n\nSikkim.  \n\n7   All the cities in the NER have public health rules that regulate the discharge of human wastes, but.these rules are \nwidely ignored. Although septic tank emptying services are provided by both public and private entities, there are \nno facilities for treatment. In all the program cities, the shallow groundwater table and streams are often polluted by \nwastewater,  which  is  commonly  discharged  into  roadside  drains,  exposing  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  and \ndownstream water users to the health risks that go with poor environmental sanitation. Generally, the problems are \nworse in lower-lying areas, along the rivers, and in slum and squatter communities. Wastewater percolating into the \nsoil causes the landslips that cause problems for all the hill cities, particularly Aizawl, Gangtok, and Kohima. \n\n8   Gangtok approved its Municipal Act in 2007, and Mizoram, in 2008. It may take some time for all functions to be \n\nprogressively devolved. \n\n\fAppendix 3        33 \n\nRoad Map \n\ndesign, high rates of NRW, and high establishment costs have raised operating costs, even as \ntariffs  have  stayed  low.  Weak  accounting  systems  do  not  produce  the  financial  information \nneeded to make sound improvement decisions. \n \n6. \nThe main problems facing the WSS sector are low self-financing ratios, insufficient tariff \nrecovery, and high production costs. The vast majority of urban infrastructure and services are \nfunded by the Government through the state governments. User charges and urban taxes are \nlimited.  Water  charges  as  flat  and/or  volumetric  (Aizawl  and  Kohima)  tariffs  are  levied  in  all \ncities, but they are far below the operating costs. No sewerage charge exists, except in Sikkim. \nSolid  waste  charges  are  being  levied  in  Gangtok  and  proposed  to  be  levied  in  Aizawl  and \nKohima while a solid waste tax is levied as part of property tax in Agartala, and service charges \nis in place in Shillong. The gap between the residents\u2019 desire for better services and the current \nlevel  of  services  in  the  cities  is  growing.  All  the  cities  need  to  develop  a  new  tariff  method  to \nmeet their revised cost-recovery objectives, introduce sewerage tariffs and solid waste charges, \nand monitor financial and operating indicators quarterly. In addition to reducing NRW, they need \nto achieve progress in strengthening financial management, reducing power consumption, and \nimproving operating and institutional efficiency. The following areas must be developed: (i) asset \nmanagement, (ii) asset planning, and (iii) public utility management. Private sector involvement \nin service provision is severely limited9 by the lack of regulation, commercially oriented delivery \nsystems,  and  adequate  tariffs.  The  lack  of  own-source  revenues  among  the  states  and  ULBs \ncontributes to poor operation and maintenance and the consequent low sustainability of service \ndelivery.  \n \nB. \n \nA  core  objective  of  the  Government\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012)  is  to  reduce \n7. \npoverty  and  regional  disparities  by  ensuring,  among  other,  access  to  basic  physical \ninfrastructure  and  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  better  health.10  NER,  as  one  of  the \nleast-developed  regions,  has been  prioritized for  infrastructure  and  social  service  investments. \nThe  11th  Plan  highlights  the  vital  role  of  the  capital  cities  in  NER\u2019s  socioeconomic \ntransformation. Given the difficult terrain and inaccessibility of the region, these cities perform a \nfunction of a much higher order than other cities of similar size in India. With the opening up of \ntrade with neighboring countries and the emergence of transport corridors in the region, these \ncities  are  expected  to  play  an  even  greater  role  in  the  NER  economy  as  commercial  and \nbusiness  hubs  besides  being  administrative  centers.  Investments  in  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices will unleash the potential of these cities to catalyze growth in NER. The 11th Plan, as \ndid the 10th Plan before it, also stresses the importance of improving the quality of governance \nand  service  delivery  systems.  The  plans  advocate  a  two-pronged  approach  to  urban \ndevelopment  that  couples  funds  for  capital  investments  with  reforms.11  With  the  Jawarharlal \nNehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  the  Government  has  reaffirmed  its \ncommitment  to  sustainable  urban  development.  JNNURM  looks  forward  to  fast-tracking \ninvestments in urban infrastructure in a large number of cities, subject to the cities\u2019 commitment \nto  a  range  of  reforms  in  line  with  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  of  1994  (CAA). \nJNNURM  also  advocates  balancing  asset  creation  with  asset  management,  incorporating \nprivate sector efficiencies into service delivery, and making ULBs financially sustainable service \nproviders.  \n                                                 \n9   Other than a private composting venture in Shillong, no other activities with private sector participation are in place \n\nin the major urban sectors. \n\n10  The recently approved National Urban Sanitation Policy is an immediate result of this vision. \n11  The plans\u2019 main reference for reforms is the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994 (CAA), which promotes \ndecentralized urban governance. The CAA enables the broadening of the role of ULBs from being mere providers \nof  civic  services  to  encompassing  the  wider  arena  of  socioeconomic  planning.  Further,  it  acknowledges  that \nfunctional delegation can work only if it is accompanied by financial devolution. The CAA stipulates that the states \nshould  empower  the  ULBs to  raise  revenues and undertake  reforms to  levy  user  charges,  enhance  the  property \ntax, rationalize establishment costs, and improve municipal accounting and budgeting. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  road  map  and  investment  program  derives  its  rationale  from  the \nabove development agenda and policy priorities. Its aim is to pave the way for the Government \nto  attain  its  goal  of  bringing  NER  up  to  par  with  the  developed  regions  of  India.  It  intends  to \naddress  the  urban  infrastructure  and  service  needs  that  continue  to  be  a  critical  constraint  on \nthe development of the NER cities and on the improvement of living conditions for their rapidly \ngrowing  populations.  The  road  map  and  investment  program  links  capital  investments  to \nreforms for sustainable impact. It targets those capital cities that will spearhead the repositioning \nof NER as a gateway joining India with neighboring states and the rest of South Asia, as well as \nwith  Southeast  and  East  Asia.  It  will  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  improve  environmental \nconditions  in  all  five  program  cities,  address  problems  of  poor  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and \nreduce  vulnerability  within  a  disaster-prone  environment.  Moreover,  the  investment  program \nseeks to provide adequate services to all, including the poor, and incorporates in its design the \ntools,  mechanisms,  and  resources  needed  to  ensure  that  the  views  and  aspirations  of \ncommunities within the program cities (often characterized by strong identities) are adequately \nreflected.  \n \n9. \nVision.  The road map and investment program underpinning the North Eastern Region \nCapital  Cities  Development  Investment  Program  (NERCCDIP)  is  guided  by  the  Government\u2019s \npolicy  framework  and  development  priorities.  The  vision  is  to  \u201cprovid[e]  sustainable  urban \ninfrastructure and services leading to better quality of life for a population of 2.07 million people \nby 2027\u201d and thereby create more efficient and productive cities, strengthen their economy, and \nthese  principles: \nreduce  poverty.  The \n(i) simultaneously  providing  investments  in  the  five  capital  cities  that  will  spearhead  the \nrepositioning  of  NER  as  the  gateway  linking  India  to  the  neighboring  states  and  to  Southeast \nand East Asia, (ii) providing urban infrastructure and services to realize the full potential benefits \nof  integrated  subsector  development;  and  (iii)  linking  investments  to  reforms  for  urban \ngovernance, finance, and service delivery. NERCCDIP will meet priority investment and reform \nneeds and pave the way for the attainment of the vision for the NER capital cities.  \n \nLong-Term  Sector  Needs  and  Proposed  Investment  Program.  The  assessment  of \n10. \nthe  long-term  (20-year)  urban  infrastructure  and  service  improvement  needs  and  the \nprioritization  exercise  prepared  to  match  the  requirements  of  the  five  cities  over  the  next  10 \nyears  are  based  on  growth  strategies  and  conceptual  infrastructure  master  plans.  The \ndemographic and physical growth of the cities and its distribution was assessed.12  \n \n11. \nNERCCDIP forms part of the medium- to long-term road map for the NER capital cities. \nTo  be  implemented  over  a  7-year  period,  it  places  emphasis  on  increasing  operational \nefficiencies, carrying out pilot initiatives to test methods of service delivery, and establishing the \ninstitutional,  operational,  and \nfurther \nimprovements. In the 12 years after that, the systems established would be consolidated around \nthe proven approaches and operations would continue to expand to cover most urban services \nby 2027. The states will need to identify alternative sources of financing to meet the remaining \ninvestment needs. Sources include JNNURM, the Non-lapsable Central Pool of Resources, the \nMinistry  of  Urban  Development  and  Poverty  Alleviation  (10%  of  funding),  financial  institutions, \nand private sector. \n \n\nfoundations  and  building  capacity \n\ninvestment  program \n\nroad  map  and \n\nfinancial \n\nfollows \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n12 Conceptual master plans in the form of city development plans (http://jnnurm.nic.in/).were prepared on the basis of \ngrowth  strategies,  existing  master  plans  (where  available),  consultations  with  stakeholders,  socioeconomic \nsurveys, and an analysis of infrastructure deficiencies, demand projections, and institutional absorptive capacity to \ndevelop and sustain infrastructure assets. \n\n\fAppendix 3        35 \n\nStrategic Context \n\nPolicy Framework: Urban Institutional, Financial, and Service Delivery Reforms  \n\nC. \n \n12. \nUrban development has been a key priority of the Government over the last decade. The \n11th FYP recognizes that \u201cIndian cities will be the locus and engine of economic growth over the \nnext  2  decades,  and  realization  of  the  ambitious goal  of  9%\u201310% growth  in  GDP  depends  on \nmaking Indian cities much more livable, inclusive, bankable and competitive.\u201d Both the 11th FYP \nand  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  strategy  stress  (i)  the  existence  of  intra-urban,  intrastate, \nand interstate differences in the level of urban services and the need for balanced development, \nand  (ii)  the  urgency  of  reducing  urban  poverty  as  part  of  the  strategy  of  promoting  inclusive \ngrowth.  Environmental  protection  and  environmental  sustainability\u2014the  need  to  avoid  water \npollution,  improve  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  and  increase  environmental \nawareness\u2014are also deemed critical to inclusive growth. The 11th FYP remains committed to \nstrengthening  urban  governance  and  management \nthrough  decentralization,  enhancing \naccountability,  and  establishing  regulatory frameworks for  service  delivery.  NERCCDIP,  in  line \nwith  the  11th  FYP  targets,  will  set  out  to  provide  the  urban  populations  of  the  capital  cities  of \nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura in the NER with (i) better access to water \nand  sanitation,  an  essential  Millennium  Development  Goal;  and  (ii)  improved  environment  and \npublic health. \n \nD. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  urban  policy  framework,  the  road  map  sets  a \n13. \nvision for developing urban governance, finance, and service delivery frameworks in the capital \ncities.  The  vision  entails  a  number  of  sequenced  interventions  to  (i)  advance  municipal \ngovernance  and  management  by  developing  legislative  and  institutional  frameworks  for  ULBs \nand enhancing their capacity for effective and accountable urban governance and management, \n(ii)  gradually  establish  efficient  and  financially  sustainable  WSS  service  providers,  and \n(iii) create sustainable sources of financing for urban infrastructure and services.  \n \nULBs and Local Governance. The road map supports the development of new ULBs in \n14. \nAizawl and Gangtok. In both instances, reforms will involve enabling recently enacted municipal \nlegislation  and  the  constitution  of  the  ULBs  in  each  of  these  cities.  Pending  elections  a \ndedicated  administrative  unit  will  be  created  and  its  organizational,  staffing,  and  management \nsystems  will  be  developed.  Then,  from  early  2011,  the  transfer  of  functions  from  state \ngovernment to the ULBs will be fully pursued. \n \n15. \nIn  Shillong,  where  there  is  an  operating  but  unelected  municipal  board,  the  immediate \nefforts  will  be  directed  at  transforming  it  into  a  statutory  municipal  body  within  the  existing \nboundaries; the medium-term target will be establishing an urban governance framework for the \nGreater  Shillong  area.  The  process  will  involve  enabling  the  representation  of  traditional \ngovernance  structures  within  the  municipal  system,  amending  municipal  legislation,  and \ndeveloping  an  organizational  structure,  improved  management  systems and  tools,  and  human \nresources  for  the  ULB.  In  Kohima,  where  municipal  legislation  and  an  elected  municipal  body \nexist,  reforms  will  accelerate  municipal  capacity  building,  including  the  actual  transfer  of \nfunctions,  assets  and  financial  resources,  and  staff  to  the  municipality,  the  upgrading  of \nadministrative  and  management  systems,  and  the  development  of  ward  and  village  structures \nand capacity according to the state\u2019s \u201ccommunitization policy.\u201d In addition, the current Municipal \nAct will undergo minor revisions in line with the CAA. In Agartala, which is the most advanced \ncity in terms of ULB reforms, efforts will be directed at providing the Agartala municipality and its \nzones  and  wards  with  adequate  administrative,  management,  and  operating  systems  and \nstaffing. In all the three existing ULBs of Agartala, Kohima, and Shillong, steps will be taken to \nbetter define the roles of the legislative and executive branches; streamline key processes such \nas  those  for  budgeting  and  for  financial  and  asset  inventory  and  management;  amend  the \norganizational  structure,  e.g.,  by  creating  new  wings,  units,  or  sections;  and  introduce  a \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\npersonnel  code  of  practice  (office  administration  regulation  rules)  and  performance-based \nmanagement systems.  \n \n16. \nEfficient  and  Sustainable  Service  Providers. The road map  stipulates  that  cities  will \ngradually  develop  ring-fenced WSS  service  providers focused  on good-quality  service  delivery \nand financial sustainability. In the short term, existing state departments will be restructured into \ndivisions  with  dedicated  responsibility  for  city  water  supply  and  sewerage,  to  be  eventually \ntransformed  into  financially  viable  WSS  providers.  The  divisions  will  be  provided  with \n(i) double-entry  accounting  systems  that  can  record  assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  and  costs; \n(ii) management  systems  for  carrying  out  in  the  short  term  a  NRW  reduction  and  metering \nprogram,  later  to  become  an  asset  management  program,  and  performance-based  service \ndelivery systems; and (iii) the ability to levy user charges, adjust tariffs, and retain and use funds \nfor  gradual  cost  recovery,  as  well  as  to  optimize  and  redistribute  staff.  In  the  medium  term, \nefforts will be directed at developing well-tailored options for WSS service providers operating in \na client-oriented, cost-effective, and sustainable manner, with their own sources of funds. This \nprocess would involve (i) awareness campaigns; (ii) valuation of assets and financial modeling \nof  options;  (iii) proposals  for  the  structure,  functions,  organization,  staffing,  and  financial  and \nhuman resource management systems for the preferred option; (iv) stakeholder consultations to \ngenerate  consensus  on  the  preferred  option;  (v)  the  passage  of  legislation  to  implement  the \npreferred  option;  and  (vi) the  creation  of  the  agency.  While  a  number  of  options\u2014such  as  a \npublicly owned agency under the state, a community-owned agency, or an agency owned jointly \nby the state, the ULB, and the community\u2014are available, given the decentralization framework, \nring-fencing  the  WSS  operations  at  ULB  level  would  be  the  most  appropriate  option  to \ncontemplate.  \n \nAppropriate arrangements would be made initially at the state level and eventually at the \n17. \nULB  level  for  regulating  the  WSS  service  provider  and  any  future  concessionaires  and  for \nadvising on policy development. Due consideration will be given to the rights and roles of water \nrights holders and private and community water suppliers. In the case of Kohima, support would \nbe provided for the development of a sustainable partnership agreement between the state and \nthe  water  rights  holders,  involving  compensation  measures  for  water  withdrawals  based  on \nmetered water consumption. \n \n18.  Municipal Finance  Reforms.  Institutional reforms will be accompanied with reforms to \nset in motion a system of sustainable funding. Reforms in this regard will involve the introduction \nand  rationalization  of  user  charges  through  (i)  volumetric  metering  of  water  supplies,  coupled \nwith volumetric water charges; (ii) imposition of a new sewerage service charge as a percentage \nof the water bill; (iii) levy of solid waste service charges based on the level of service provided; \nand (iv) improved collection efficiencies. The charges will be set low for basic consumption and \nincreased according to consumption level, allowing all consumers, even the poor, to afford the \nservices.  \n \n19. \nThe interventions will also involve reforming the property tax as a major source of local \nrevenue. The property tax will be introduced in those cities where it is not currently levied (i.e., \nAizawl,  Gangtok,  and  Kohima)  and  enhanced  in  Agartala  and  Shillong.  It  will  be  set  at  a  level \nthat generates revenues of 1%\u20132% of capital value, and the tax rate will be increased as public \nacceptance  grows.  The  property  tax  reforms  will  involve  improving  tax  administration \n(area-based  methods  supported  by  geographic  information  systems  and  computerization  of \nbilling  and  other  functions),  periodically  revising  property  tax  assessment,  and  improving  tax \ncollection  efficiency.  Finally,  the  reforms  will  include  measures  to  promote  the  efficient  and \ntransparent  use  of  financial  resources:  (i)  a  modern,  accrual-based  double-entry  system  of \naccounting will be implemented to enable the regular issuance of financial statements on urban \noperations  and  the  recording  of  all  bills,  state  grants,  fixed  assets,  and  physical  inventories; \n(ii) accounting  will  be  computerized;  and  (iii)  an  efficient  and  transparent  budget  process  that \n\n\fAppendix 3        37 \n\nlinks financial targets to physical targets set as part of city investment programming will be put in \nplace.  \n \n20. \nPotential  for  Private  Participation.  Under NERCCDIP, the dominant mode of service \ndelivery  is  government-led  (ULBs,  state  departments,  future  water  and  sewerage  agencies). \nThis  is  justified,  as  NERCCDIP  is  limited  to  basic  urban  infrastructure  sectors  in  which  (i)  a \nnatural  monopoly  exists;  (ii)  the  services  and  benefits  are  of  the  nature  of  public  good;  and \n(iii) the  externality  and  interdependence  of  multiple  sectors  require  integrated  management.  In \nthe short term, private sector participation (PSP) on a major scale is constrained by the lack of \nregulatory  frameworks,  commercially  oriented  service  delivery  systems,  and  adequate  tariff \nstructures  and  rates  that  allow  the  private  sector  to  have  satisfactory  cost  recovery.  However, \nthe NERCCDIP reform initiatives creating regulatory frameworks, efficient and financially viable \nservice delivery systems, and enhanced tariffs will gradually create an enabling environment for \nPSP.  NERCCDIP  will  also  finance  a  PSP  study  to  examine  specific  components  with  PSP \npotential.13  The  study,  to  be  conducted  in  each  city  through  adequate  awareness-raising  and \nparticipatory  methods,  will  propose  detailed  time-bound  road  maps  for  realistic  PSP  in  the \nsectors where potential is identified and will survey interest among potential private partners.  \n \nE. \n \n21. \nIt is estimated that over $1.9 billion will be needed over the next 20 years to meet all the \ninfrastructure  requirements  of  the  five  cities,  and  $1.1  billion  will  be  needed  to  meet  essential \nservice  delivery  functions  relating  to  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement.14 Financial assistance from NERCCDIP to cover 26% of the estimated cost of the \noverall program is proposed.  \n \n22. \nImpact and Outcome. Both the Government\u2019s investment program and NERCCDIP are \nexpected to improve the quality of life for 1.2 million people and enhance urban productivity in \nthe five capital cities by (i) making urban infrastructure and services more accessible to the city \npopulations,  including  the  poor;  and  (ii)  supporting  urban  institutional,  management,  service \ndelivery, and financial reforms to create an environment and capacity for sustainable provision \nof  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  NERCCDIP  constitutes  an  opportunity  to  finance  priority \ninvestments.\n\nInvestment Program \n\n                                                 \n13  PSP may take the form of

\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: India/Northeast Region Capital Cities Development Investment Program \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSouth Asia Department/ \nUrban Development Division \n\n \n\nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nADB's  strategies  are  aligned  with  India\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan.  The  Government  continues  to  focus  on  infrastructure \ninvestment,  social  development,  and  agriculture  and  rural  development  to  make  the  growth  process  more  inclusive. \nNortheastern Region Capital Cities Development Investment Program is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy and the Government\u2019s \n11th  Plan.  It  will  have  direct  impact  on  poverty  reduction  by  increasing  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  a  basic  need. \nImprovements  in sewerage  and  sanitation and in  solid  waste  management  will  result  in public  health  improvements  for  the \npoor, who have less access to basic urban services.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention   \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nUsing both primary (socioeconomic survey and community consultations) and secondary data (including reviews of central \nand state government programs on poverty alleviation), poverty analysis with poverty mapping was undertaken during \nprogram preparation. \n \nStatistics from the Planning Commission of India (2001) shows that the Northeast region is home to 3.1 million persons living \nbelow poverty. Official statistics quote poverty to be largely rural with 2.9 million persons in rural areas classified as poor (this \ncorresponds  to  a  poverty  headcount  of  40%).  While  the  poverty  headcount  is  relatively  low  in  urban  areas  (8%  with  0.16 \nmillion  persons  classified  as  poor),  due  to  urban  population  growth  including  the  increasing  rural-to-urban  migration,  urban \npoverty is an emerging issue. It should also be noted that the urban\u2013rural distinction in the Northeastern Region suffers from \nunclear  definitions,  and  studies  show  that  there  are  areas  classified  as  rural,  which  should  actually  fall  under  the  urban \ncategory. While official estimates show relatively low levels of urban poverty\u2014other definitions suggest urban poverty is likely \nto be underestimated. The socioeconomic survey undertaken in program cities show that 14% to 39% have incomes below $1 \nper  capita  per  day.  This  is  consistent  with  State  estimates  of  poverty  used  for  determining  households  who  will  receive \nassistance which ranges from 16% to 25% in program cities. \n \n2.  Design features  \n \nBasic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  from  the  Program  will  have  positive  impacts  on  the  poor.  Safe  drinking  water  is  a \nbasic need which significant numbers of poor people in the Northeastern region do not have easy access to. The burden of \nwater  collection  on  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population  such  as  women  will  be  reduced.  Improvements  in  sewage \ntreatment, sanitation, and solid waste management will lead to public health improvements resulting in reductions in burden of \ndiseases\u2014treatment costs and productivity losses\u2014whose impacts are experienced by the poor in higher degrees. Low cost \nsanitation facilities will also be piloted in poor areas. Program components will also generate employment opportunities for the \npoor. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe North Eastern Region, largely because of geographic isolation, deficient infrastructure, and low investment, has low gross \ndomestic  product  and  few  employment  opportunities,  and  remains  a  highly  underdeveloped  region  in  India.  Low  access  to \nbasic urban infrastructure and services in the region, particularly for poor segments of the population, is also detrimental to \npublic health. \n \nPrimary data show that in the program citiesa up to 60% of the poor have no access to water connections. Many depend on \npublic water sources, hand pumps, streams, and rivers for their water supply, and devote time and energy to water collection. \nMost, having very limited access to safe drinking water, apply some form of treatment before consumption. Most of the poor \nare not connected to sewerage systems and many have no access to adequate sanitation: up to two thirds rely on unsanitary \npit latrines. Up to 40% dump solid waste in open spaces or drains, for lack of collection systems. All these factors contribute to \npoor  public  health.  Water-borne  diseases  such  as  hepatitis,  diarrhea,  malaria,  and  typhoid  are  common  among  poor \nhouseholds.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   Appendix 9 \n\n    51 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive  consultations  in  the  form  of  consultation  workshops,  meetings,  FGDs,  and  structured  interviews  have  been \nundertaken  with  the  following  stakeholders:  beneficiary  communities  and  affected  households  (including  poor  and  other \nvulnerable households and households headed by women or indigenous persons), NGOs and CBOs, elected representatives \n(such as councilors and ministers), traditional organizations, ULBs, administrative departments, state governments, and the \ncentral Government. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\nX  Information sharing       X  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nExtensive information dissemination and consultations have been undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in program \ndesign. During program preparation, it was noted that a key factor in the nonperformance of many poverty reduction programs \nis  the  lack  of  participation  by  the  poor.  A  stakeholder  participation  framework,  which  engages  key  stakeholders  in  design, \nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance,  has  been  formulated  for  each  program  city.  The  gender  action  plan  also \nincludes a gender-responsive participation framework, which identifies the role of women in program design, implementation, \nand operation and maintenance. \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \n \nPrimary and secondary data have been analyzed to assess the status of women in program cities. While there are differences \nin the status of women in the different program cities, there are also common trends. In education, although female literacy is \nhigh, it is a few percentage points lower than male literacy. Unemployment is higher among women than among men, and the \ndisparity in unemployment levels increaes with lower incomes. For example, in Agartala, unemployment is 24% among poor \nfemale-headed households but only 10% in poor male-headed households. There is also a high correlation between poverty \nand the gender of the household head. Again, in the case of Agartala, women head 18% of all households but 32% of poor \nhouseholds.  While  day-to-day  household  decisions  are  made  by  women,  all  major  decisions,  such  as  those  related  to \nchildren\u2019s education, and the purchase and sale of property, are made by male members of the family.  \n \nWomen\u2019s  issues  and  priorities  were  identified  during  program  design.  Stakeholders  concerned  with  improving  the status  of \nwomen, including female councilors, self-help groups for women, NGOs involved in gender issues, and institutions involved in \nwomen\u2019s development, were consulted. The lack of basic urban infrastructure and services affects women more than men. \nThe  burden  of  water  collection  falls  on  women  because  of  their  primary  role  in  managing  the  household.  During  program \npreparation,  it  was  noted  that  water  collection  takes  an  average  of  4\u20135  hours  per  day,  reducing  the  time  women  have  to \nengage  in  productive  activities  that  would  increase  the  household  income  and  improve  their  position  within  the  household. \nLack of clean water supply also burdens women who handle water more than men. Women are more exposed to diseases \nfrom contaminated water in the process of collecting water, and using water in cooking and washing. A reduction in diseases, \naside  from  reducing  treatment  costs  and  productivity  losses,  would  also  reduce  the  burden  of  caring  for  sick  household \nmembers, a role often taken on by women in the household. The lack of toilet facilities also has larger impact on women\u2019s \nsense of privacy.  NERCCDIP  responds  to  these  issues  in  the  design  of  its subprojects.  In  addition,  it  will provide  enclosed \nbathing  spaces  as  part  of  public  sanitation  subprojects,  extend  waste  collection  to  unserved  areas  to  reduce  unhygienic \nconditions near homes, and involve women in water management. \n \n2.  Key  Actions.

A  gender  action  plan  has  been  formulated  to  maximize  program  benefits  for  women  through  gender \nmainstreaming in the program and a gender-responsive participation framework. Gender mainstreaming will be done in four \nareas:  awareness  generation,  gender  sensitization,  institutional  arrangements,  and  training  and  capacity  building.

It  will  improve  and  expand  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  cities, \nincluding  the  slums,  and  strengthen  the  management  and  financing  capacity  of  urban \ninstitutions.  NERCCDIP  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  improved  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices,  including  rehabilitated,  improved,  and  expanded  water  supply,  sewerage  and \nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  facilities;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  and  investment \nprogram management. \n \nimpact. \n2. \nRehabilitation  subprojects  will  be  accommodated  within  the  premises  of  existing  facilities  and \nwill not involve land acquisition or resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction of water \nsupply,  sanitation  and  sewerage,  and  solid  waste  management  systems  will  be  carried  out  on \nvacant government land wherever possible. The overall impact will be further minimized through \ncareful subproject siting and alignment during detailed design and subproject implementation. A \nshort  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  Gangtok  water  supply  subproject \n(Supplementary Appendix G), the only subproject in tranche 1 with resettlement impact.2  \n\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement \n\nis  designed \n\nto  minimize \n\nNERCCDIP \n\nB. \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\nframework \n\nthe  resettlement \n\nThis  summary  captures \n\n3. \nin \nthe  salient  points  of \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  The  resettlement  framework  outlines  the  objectives,  policy \nprinciples, and procedures of land acquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance \nmeasures for affected persons. The resettlement framework is based on national laws (the Land \nAcquisition  Act  of  1894,  amended  in  1984,  and  the  National  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement \nPolicy of 2007), state laws and regulations,3 and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). These documents are compared and gaps are addressed \nin the resettlement framework.  \n \nWith  all  these  in  mind,  core  involuntary  resettlement  principles  have  been  put  together \n4. \nfor  NERCCDIP:  (i)  as  a  policy  principle,  land  acquisition  and  other  involuntary  resettlement \nimpact  will  be  minimized  as  much  as  possible;  (ii)  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  will  be \ncarried  out  and  compensation  provided  in  order to  improve  or  at  least  restore  the  income  and \nliving standards of affected persons to their level before the program; (iii) affected people will be \nconsulted on compensation options; (iv) compensation will be paid for acquired assets at market \nor  replacement  rates;  (v)  compensation  for  lost  land,  housing,  and  assets  and  resettlement \nallowances  will  be  paid  in full  before the  contractor  takes  physical  control  of  the  land  and  any \nconstruction  activities  begin;  (vi)  resettlement  assistance  will  be  offered  to  affected  persons \n\n                                                 \n1  Agartala, Aizawl, Gangtok, Kohima, and Shillong. \n2  The subproject will have temporary impact from the laying of water supply distribution networks. The transect walks \n\nshow that disruption is minimal and can be mitigated. \n\n3  The relevant state laws are: (i) for Agartala: the Tripura Municipal Act of 1994 and the Tripura Land Revenue and \nLand Reform Act of 1960; (ii) for Aizawl: the Mizoram Prevention of Government Land Encroachment Act of 2001 \nand the Mizoram Urban and Regional Development Act of 1990; (iii) for Gangtok: the Sikkim Urban and Regional \nPlanning Development Act of 1998 and the Sikkim Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act of 1977; (iv) for Kohima: \nthe  Nagaland  Land  (Requisition  and  Acquisition)  Act of  1965,  the  Nagaland  Eviction  of Persons  in  Unauthorized \nOccupation of Public Land Act of 1971, the Nagaland (Ownership) and Transfer of Its Land Resource) Act of 1990, \nand the Nagaland Town and Country Planning Act of 1966; and (v) for Shillong: the Meghalaya Town and Country \nPlanning Act of 1973. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nincluding  non-titled  persons  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers  or  squatters,  and  encroachers)  before  the \ncontractor  takes  physical  control  of  the  land  and  any  construction  activities  begin; (vii)  income \nwill  be  restored  and  rehabilitated;  (viii)  appropriate  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be \nestablished  to  speed  up  the  resolution  of  disputes;  (ix)  special  attention  will  be  given  to \nvulnerable  groups;  and  (x)  women  will  be  involved  in  resettlement  planning,  implementation, \nand monitoring. The entitlement matrix for NERCCDIP is in Table A10.1. \n \n5. \nCompensation will be paid for loss of land, structures, trees and crops, and other assets, \nat replacement cost. A valuation committee will be formed to determine replacement values. It \nwill comprise the land acquisition officer from the revenue department of the state government, \nthe  resettlement  officer  and  social  development  specialist  from  the  state  investment  program \nmanagement  and  implementation  unit  (SIPMIU),  and  representatives  of  affected  persons  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Vulnerable  households  will  be  given  additional \nassistance  in  the  form  of  land-for-land  replacement  options,  preferential  consideration  in \nsubproject employment, skills and livelihood training, and income-generating assets. Short-term \nincome  restoration  activities \nthe  provision  of  short-term  allowances  such  as \n(i) subsistence  allowances  (3  months),  and  (ii)  shifting  assistance.  Medium-term  income \nrestoration activities, such as the provision of income-generating assets and longer-term training \nwill also be provided. \n\ninclude \n\nC. \n\nProcedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n\n6. \nResettlement  plans  for  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  the  following  manner.  SIPMIUs \nwill  undertake  socioeconomic  surveys  for  each  identified  subproject,  based  on  the  preliminary \ntechnical design. If the impact is found to be significant,4 full resettlement plans will be prepared \nfor the subproject; if not, short resettlement plans will be prepared. The resettlement plans will \ninclude  measures  to  ensure  that  the  socioeconomic  conditions,  needs,  and  priorities  of \nvulnerable groups are identified and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement does \nnot  disadvantage  vulnerable  groups.  Social  development  specialists familiar  with  ADB  policies \nand  procedures  for  the  preparation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans  will  be  among  the \nconsultants.  The  resettlement  plans  will  comply  with  national  and  state  policies,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  other  social  safeguard  guidelines,  and  the \nresettlement  framework.  The  resettlement  plan  for  tranche  1  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of other subproject resettlement  plans. Approval  of  subproject \nresettlement  plans  by  ADB  and  compensation  before  displacement  will  be  conditions  for  the \ncontracting of civil works.  \n \nThe  Executing  Agency,  through  the  investment  program  coordination  cell  (IPCC),  will \n7. \nensure  that  this  resettlement  framework  is  closely  followed  when  a  resettlement  plan  is \nformulated  for  a  subproject.  The  Executing  Agency  will  further  ensure  that  adequate \nresettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  SIPMIUs,  and  that  NGOs  are  involved  in  the \ntimely implementation of the resettlement plans. \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nThe Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) will be the national EA for NERCCDIP. The \n8. \nIPCC, to be established in MOUD, will include a social officer. A national steering committee will \nmonitor  fund  use  and  overall  implementation  performance  of  NERCCDIP.  A  state  executing \nagency will execute the part of the loan falling under each state government. \n                                                 \n4  Resettlement  is  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impact.  The  impact  is  major  when  it \nphysically  displaces  affected  people  from  housing  or  causes  them  to  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive, \nincome-generating assets. \n\n\f \n\n

Focus \ngroup discussions, meetings, and individual interviews were held with stakeholders, particularly \naffected  households,  and  a  survey  was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential  impact  of  land \nacquisition.  Information  was,  and  continues  to  be,  disseminated  to  the  affected  persons. \nLocal-language versions of the resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be placed in                                     \nlibraries. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \nand  state  government  websites.  Finalized  resettlement  plans  will  also  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite, state government websites, and SIPMIU websites, and information dissemination and \nconsultation  will  continue  throughout  program  implementation.Grievances  of  affected  persons \nwill  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  implementing  NGO  or  the  resettlement  officer  and \nsocial  development  specialist.  Grievances  not  redressed  by  either  will  be  brought  before  the \ngrievance  redress  committee  (GRC)  established  in  each  state.  Each  GRC  will  comprise  the \nstate  investment  program  director,  the  resettlement  officer  and  social  development  specialist, \nthe land acquisition officer of the state government, a representative of the implementing NGO, \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nfemale and male representatives of the affected persons (including vulnerable households), and \nan eminent member of the community. The GRC will meet every month, determine the merit of \neach grievance, and resolve grievances within a month of receiving the complaint, failing which \nthe  grievance  will  be  addressed  by  the  IPEC.5  Further  grievances  will  be  referred  by  affected \npersons  to  appropriate  courts  of  law.  All  grievances  received,  including  contact  details  of  the \ncomplainant,  the  date  the  complaint  was  received,  the  nature  of  the  grievance,  the  agreed \ncorrective actions and the date these were carried out, and the final outcome, will be recorded. \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n11. \nResettlement  plan  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  to  provide  the  Executing \nAgency  with  an  effective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying  potential \ndifficulties  and  problems.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  by  the  SIPMIU.  Internal \nmonitoring  will  involve:  (i)  administrative  monitoring  to  ensure  that  implementation  is  on \nschedule  and  problems  are  dealt  with  on  time;  (ii)  socioeconomic  monitoring  during  and  after \nany  resettlement  impact,  using  baseline  information  established  through  the  socioeconomic \nsurvey of affected persons undertaken during subproject preparation; and (iii) overall monitoring \nto assess the status of affected persons. Job charts will be given to the resettlement officer and \nsocial development specialist. The job charts will indicate the targets to be achieved during the \nmonth.  Monthly  progress  reports  of  actual  achievements  against  the  targets  fixed  in  the \nrespective  job  charts  and  the  reasons  for  any  shortfalls  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  the \nExecuting Agency. The SIPMIU will be responsible for managing and maintaining databases on \nthe affected, documenting the results of the census of affected persons, and verifying asset and \nsocioeconomic survey data to be used as the baseline for assessing the impact of resettlement \nplan  implementation.  The  Executing  Agency  will  appoint  an  independent  agency  to  undertake \nexternal  monitoring to  document:  (i)  the  restoration  of  income  levels;  (ii) changes  and  shifts  in \noccupation pattern; (iii) changes in the type of housing of affected persond; (iv) assessment of \naffected  persons\u2019  access  to  amenities,  such  as  water,  electricity,  and  transportation;  and \n(v) performance of the NGO and the SIPMIU in resettlement implementation. The independent \nagency  will  monitor  subprojects  twice  a  year  and  submit  reports  directly  to  the  Executing \nAgency, which will submit all external monitoring reports to ADB for review.  \n\nG. \n\nResettlement Budget \n\n12. \nDetailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  prepared  for  each \nresettlement  plan  by  the  SIPMIU  and  will  be  included  in  the  overall  subproject  estimate.  The \nbudget  will  include  (i)  detailed  costs  of  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and  livelihood  and  income \nrestoration and improvement; (ii) source of funding; (iii) arrangements for approval; and (iv) flow \nof  funds  and  contingency  arrangements.  All  land  acquisition  funds  will  be  provided  by  the \nExecuting Agency. Land acquisition, compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of income and \nlivelihood will be considered an integral component of program costs. \n\n                                                 \n5  The IPECwill be fully empowered by the state government to decide on all matters related to NERCCDIP. These \nmatters  will  include  financial  and  administrative  approvals;  approval  of  procurement,  tenders,  and  purchases; \nappointment of staff; creation of posts; recruitment of consultants; and decisions related to land acquisition. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n61 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction and Description of the Investment Program \n\nThe  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development \n\nInvestment  Program \n1. \n(NERCCDIP) envisages the achievement of sustainable urban development in the project cities \nof  Agartala  (in  the  state  of  Tripura),  Aizawl  (Mizoram),  Kohima  (Nagaland),  Gangtok  (Sikkim), \nand  Shillong (Meghalaya) through  investments  in  urban  infrastructure sectors.  NERCCDIP  will \nsupport  the  Government  of  India  and  the  five  state  governments  in  their  policy  of  balanced \nregional  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  through  improvements  in  urban \ngovernance,  management,  and  infrastructure  and  service  provision.  NERCCDIP  will  support \n(i) water  supply;  (ii)  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment;  (iii) municipal  solid  waste  management; \nand (iv) planning and design, institutional and capacity development, and awareness raising.  \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nNERCCDIP is designed to improve environmental quality and living conditions in urban \n2. \nareas  through  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs) \nconducted  for  NERCCDIP  show  that  net  subproject  environmental  benefits  are  positive  and \nlarge,  and  include  (i)  reduced  pollution  resulting  from  investments  in  sewage  treatment  and \nmunicipal  solid  waste  management;  (ii)  increased  availability  of  adequate  potable  water  at \nappropriate  pressure  from  water  supply  subprojects;  (iii)  better  public  health,  particularly \nreduction  in  waterborne  and  infectious  diseases,  through  investments  in  water  supply  and \nsewage treatment, and in municipal solid waste management; and (iv) improved aesthetics from \nthe improvement of sewage treatment and municipal solid waste works. \n \n3. \nThere  will  be  no  adverse  cumulative  or  sector-level  impact.  The  potential  negative \nsubproject impact during construction and operation will not be significant, and most of it will be \nlocalized  and  temporary.  Environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  will  further  ensure  that \nNERCCDIP  has  no  significant  adverse  impact  on  the  environment.  Impact  that  is  potentially \nsignificant and permanent in nature has been identified; the environmental subproject selection \ncriteria will not allow subprojects with such impact. The potential negative impact and mitigation \nmeasures are summarized in Table A11.1. \n\n \nTable A11.1: Summary of Potential Adverse Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nPotential Negative Impact \nA.

If  future  subprojects  involve \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact,  resettlement  plans  based  on  the \nresettlement framework agreed on by the Government and ADB will be prepared.  \nNo  subproject  will  be  sited  within  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  and  core  zones  of \nbiosphere  reserves.  Through  proper  alignment  or  site  selection,  NERCCDIP  will \navoid  or  minimize  locating  facilities  in  forested  areas.  If  location  on  reserve  forest \nland is unavoidable,  work  will  be  undertaken  only  after  consultation  and  clearance \nfrom the state forest department.  \nAdopt erosion control measures such as stabilization of topsoil and vegetation cover \nto arrest erosion. \n \nAdopt best proven treatment technology considering site-specific characteristics and \ndesign the facility to meet the CPCB disposal standards.

Provide/Procure    maintenance  equipment \nwith  adequate  safety  design  features  for  safe  cleaning  or  maintenanceof  sewers \nand septic tanks. \n \nNo  subproject  will  be  sited  within  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  and  core  zones  of \nbiosphere  reserves.  Through  proper  alignment  or  site  selection,  NERCCDIP  will \navoid  or  minimize  locating  facilities  in  forested  areas.  If  location  on  reserve  forest \nland is unavoidable,  work  will  be  undertaken  only  after  consultation  and  clearance \nfrom the state forest department. Work will be confined to the actual subproject site, \nand  no  auxiliary  activities  will  be  carried  out  in  these  areas.  No  work  will  be \nundertaken when it rains. \nIdentify beneficial use of waste soil. Use waste for construction or to fill up low-lying \nareas. Obtain construction material from licensed quarries. \n\nUse  construction  equipment  that  complies  with  CPCB  emission standards.  Ensure \nregular  wetting  of  soil.

An  investment  program  coordination  cell  (IPCC)  will  be  established  in \nMOUD.  IPCC  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of  NERCCDIP  in  the  five  cities \nand  will  include  social  and  environmental  safeguard  specialists,  who  will  monitor  NERCCDIP \nimplementation  and  review  and  screen  the  subprojects  submitted  by  the  states  in  accordance \nwith the subproject selection criteria, including the environmental provisions. A national steering \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n63 \n\ncommittee  (NSC)  will  be  set  up  by  the  Government  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to \nmonitor the use of funds under the multitranche financing facility and the overall implementation \nperformance  of  NERCCDIP.  A  project  management  consultant  to  IPCC  will  support  and \ncoordinate the environmental assessment and review. A state executing agency (SEA) in each \nstate will be responsible for executing the part of the loan falling under the state government.  \n \n5. \nA  consolidated  state  investment  program  management  and  implementation  unit \n(SIPMIU)  headed  by  a  program  director  will  be  established  in  each  of the five  SEAs.  SIPMIU \nwill  oversee  environment  and  resettlement  planning  for  NERCCDIP.  This  task  includes  the \npreparation  of  all  documentation  needed  for  decision  making,  contracting,  and  supervision  of \nwork, and the provision of progress monitoring information to the SIPMIU program director. The \nSIPMIU  will  have  a  safeguards  and  social  cell  staffed  with  an  environment  officer,  who  will \nimplement the environmental safeguard provisions including (i) ensuring that the environmental \ncriteria for subproject selection in the environmental assessment and review framework (EARF, \nalso see Table A11.2) are followed; (ii) ensuring that the mitigation requirements are included in \ncontractor bidding documents; and (iii)  coordinating with various central and state government \nagencies in compliance matters. The SIPMIU will appoint and manage construction contractors \nto  build  elements  of  the  infrastructure;  they  will  be  required  to  submit  environmental \nimplementation plans (EIPs) to SIPMIU for approval.  \n \nSIPMIU  will  be  assisted  by  design,  construction  supervision  and  management \n6. \nconsultant, who will design the infrastructure, manage the tendering of contracts, and supervise \nthe construction process. An environment specialist in the DSMC team will be responsible for \naddressing  the  environmental  issues  in  the  program  components  during  design  and \nimplementation.  The  specialist  will  ensure  that  all  mitigation  requirements  are  included  in \ncontractor  bidding  documents  and  EIPs,  and  will  supervise  the  effective  implementation  of \nenvironmental provisions during construction. In addition, the specialist will assist the SIPMIU in \nthe procurement needs and other project implementation aspects and will have a central role in \nbuilding  the  environmental  management  capacity  of  the  SIPMIU,  the  contractor,  and  the  line \ndepartments through support and training.  \n \n7. \nThe DSMC team will submit periodic monitoring and implementation reports to SIPMIU, \nwhich  will  take  the  necessary  follow-up  actions.  SIPMIU  will  submit  monitoring  reports  to  the \nprogram  director,  who  will  then  forward  these  to  ADB.  SIPMIU  will  also  prepare  annual \nmonitoring reports for IPCC and assist the latter in preparing an annual monitoring report to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The annual report will focus on the progress of implementation \nof  the  environmental  management  plans,  and  EARF  implementation,  issues  encountered  and \nmeasures adopted, follow-up actions required, if any, and the status of NERCCDIP compliance \nwith subproject selection criteria and relevant loan covenants. IPCC will seek clearance for the \nsubmission and disclosure of the annual environmental monitoring report to ADB. \n\nD. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n\nStakeholder consultation was an integral part of the environmental assessment process. \n8. \nDuring  project  preparation,  consultations  were  undertaken  with  various  stakeholder  groups \nincluding  state  government \nrepresentatives,  nongovernment \norganizations  and  environmental  groups,  urban  residents,  and  affected  persons.  These \nconsultations  were  conducted  at  various  levels  (project,  state,  and  subproject  levels)  and \nemployed  various  methods  (socioeconomic  survey  of  5,000  households,  formal  meetings, \nindividual  interviews,  structured  discussions,  and  focus  group  discussions).  Consultations  with \n\nrepresentatives,  elected \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\neach  of  the  five  states  were  held  in  November  2005.  Regular  and  continued  stakeholder \nparticipation at all stages of project design and implementation is envisaged.  \n \n9. \nDuring  program  preparation,  consultations  and  presentations  were  made  to  affected \npersons and the general population in the subproject sites in January and February 2006. The \nconsultations  detailed  potential  impact  due  to  the  subprojects,  and  discussions  were  held  on \nmeasures proposed in the IEEs to address the foreseen impact. The IEEs will be translated into \nthe  local  language  and  disclosed  through  public  notices  at  urban  local  bodies  and  SIPMIU \noffices  through  posters  presenting  the  subproject\u2019s  environmental  impact  and  mitigation \nmeasures. These posters will be posted on state government and SIPMIU websites. SIPMIU will \nissue notices 1 month ahead of the start date of subproject implementation to create awareness \nof  subproject  implementation  among  the public. Moreover,  a grievance  redress  cell  will  be  set \nup  within  the  SIPMIU  to  register  grievances  of  the  people  regarding  technical,  social,  and \nenvironmental  aspects.  This  participatory  process  will  ensure  that  all  views  of  the  people  are \nadequately reviewed and suitably incorporated in the design and implementation process. \n\nE. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\n10. \nIEEs  show  that  sample  subprojects  will  result  in  large  net  environmental  benefits. \nPotential  adverse  environmental  impact  is  largely  temporary  and  localized  and  can  be \naddressed  through  subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  No  further  assessment  on \nenvironmental impacts is required for sample subprojects.  \n\nF. \n\nEnvironmental Selection Criteria and Environmental Review Procedures \n\nTo  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  environmental  criteria  and \n11. \nrequirements,  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  and  an  EARF \nthe \nimplementation  of  future  subprojects  have  been  developed.  A  summary  of  the  environmental \nsubproject selection criteria is provided in Table A11.2. \n \n12. \nThe  full  EARF,  based  on  provisions  of  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  policies  and \nlegislative  provisions  and  the  environmental  assessment  criteria  of  ADB,  is  provided  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  M.

\n\nthe \n\nfocus  on \n\nEnabling Environment \n\nimprove  revenue  mobilization,  and  strengthen \n\n1. \nThe proposed capacity development program will target two different levels of assistance: \n(i)  project  implementation;  and  (ii)  a  comprehensive  capacity-building  program  to  support  the \naccomplishment  of India\u2019s  urban  institutional  and financial  reform  agenda,  enhance  planning  and \nfinancial \noperation  and  maintenance, \nmanagement  capabilities  of  service  providers.  Capacity  development  will  be  undertaken  at  five \nessential  levels  or  entry  points:  (i)  enabling  environment,  (ii)  sector  capacity,  (iii)  organization  or \nentity\u2019s capacity, (iv) individual agency employee capacity, and (v) end user or beneficiary. \n \n2. \nCapacity  development  will  require  a  variety  of  learning  and  development  methods  (formal \ntraining  and  seminars,  study  tours,  on-the-job  work  experience,  etc.)  delivered  by  two  teams  of \nexperts in each state. The design, construction supervision, and management consultants will be \nresponsible for strengthening the design, management (including utility management for increased \nefficiency), and administration capabilities of key state and urban local body (ULB) staff (delegated \nto  the  state  investment  program  management  and  implementation  unit  [SIPMIU]),  while  the \ninstitutional  development  consultants  will \nimplementing  essential  sector  reform \nrequirements  pertaining  to  municipal  governance  and  financial  reform  and  improved  service \ndelivery.  Specific  outputs  and  outcomes  expected  to  result  from  these  two  assignments  are  as \nfollows. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Jawarhalal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM) \nframework  signed  between  the  five  program  states  and  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  (MOUD) \nclearly  establishes  the  major  thrusts  of  the  urban  reform  program.  The  North  Eastern  Region \nCapital  Cities  Development Investment  Program  (NERCCDIP)  will  support  the  state  and  ULBs  in \nits implementation through the formulation of (i) municipal acts or amendments to existing ones to \nensure  compliance  with  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  of  1994  (CAA);  (ii)  government \norders/notification  of  transfer  of  functions  under  the  12th  Schedule  of  the  CAA;  (iii)  ward \ndemarcation  and  creation  of  ULB  election  committees;  and  (iv) preparation  of  a  comprehensive \nULB  staff  and  reporting  structure,  initial  budgets,  recruitment/redeployment  and  ULB  capacity \ndevelopment programs.  \n \n4. \nThe  Program  will  also  assist  the  Government  and  its  departments  and  later  the  ULB  in \nachieving  sustainability  and  accountability  in  the  water  and  sewerage  sector  by  separating \nservice  delivery  from  regulation.  For  this  purpose,  the  consultants  will  help  the  Government  (i) \ndrafting  applicable  acts  and  rules  and  other  supporting  legal  documents;  (ii)  designing  a \nregulatory body and institutional mechanisms; (iii) preparing operating procedures, training and \ndevelopment  of  regulation,  licenses,  and  rules;  and  (iv)  developing  a  clear  and  binding \nframework for tariff regulation.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAt  the  sectoral  level,  the  Program  will  support  state  governments  and  ULBs  preparing \nessential  documentation  applicable  across  the  states,  including  (i)  completion  and  adoption  of \naccounting  manuals  for  ULBs;  (ii)  preparation  of  notifications  to  pass  resolutions  regarding \nintroduction  of  property  tax  or  shifting  to  unit  area-based  systems,  and  preparation  of  associated \nroad  maps;  (iii)  rationalization  of  charges;  and  (iv)  introduction  of  guidelines  pertaining  to  the \napplication of e-governance systems across the states.  \n \n6. \nIn  addition,  NERCCDIP  will  introduce  (i)  utility  benchmarking  principles;  (ii)  utility \nrestructuring through ring-fencing of urban infrastructure and services, to separate them from the \n\nSector Network \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nOrganization or Entity\u2019s Capacity Development \n\nrest  of  the  rural  or  semirural  areas;  and (iii)  performance-based  systems  and  asset  management \nconcepts. \n \nC. \n \nAt  project  level,  NERCCDIP  will  establish  systems  and  develop  state  and  ULB  staff \n7. \ncapacity  in  project  management;  project  budgeting,  accounting,  and  financial  management; \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  quality  assurance  and  quality  control;  procurement  systems;  contract \nmanagement  and  contract  administration;  and  safeguard  compliance  and  monitoring.  It  will  also \nimprove SIPMIU design capabilities. \n \n8. \nNERCCDIP, within the specific context of each of the capital cities, will help (i) pass a ULB \nresolution regarding the shift from single-entry to double-entry accounting, (ii) complete registers \nfor  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  ULB,  (iii)  complete  the  physical  verification  and  valuation  of \nassets and liabilities, (iv) compile all entries required for the preparation of the opening balance \nsheet  and  adopt  this,  (v)  develop  municipal  financial  management  computer  software,  and \n(vi) reengineer  municipal  management  processes  to  align  with  the  accrual-based  accounting \nsystem.  \n \n9. \nNERCCDIP  will  assist  each  of  the  above  ULBs  in  (i)  conducting  a  sample  property  tax \nsurvey, (ii) preparing a draft format (road map) for the introduction or shift to the unit area system \nof  property  tax,  (iii)  preparing  digital  property  maps  for  the  municipality,  (iv)  verifying  the  digital \nmaps and conducting a full physical survey of the properties, (v) creating a geographic information \nsystem  (GIS)  database  of  property,  (vi)  conducting  an  assessment  of  guidance  value  (unit  area \nvalue),  (vii)  developing  software  for  the  administration  and  management  of  the  new  taxation \nsystem  using  the  GIS  database,  (viii)  pilot-testing  the  introduction  of  the  revised  system  in  one \nward, (ix) eliminating exemptions, and (x) setting up a website for property tax issues. \n \nD.  \n \nSpecialized  training to  be  delivered  by  the  NERCCDIP  will  include  (i)  training  of  ULB  and \n10. \nutility accounting staff in double-entry, accrual-based accounting systems and software; (ii) training \nof ULB assessment, accounting, and budgeting staff in the new property tax systems and software; \n(iii)  training  of  utility  staff  in  benchmarking,  the  introduction  of  performance-based  management \nsystems  and  their  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements,  and  the  preparation  of  asset \nmanagement  programs;  (iv)  training  of  utility  staff  in  improved  operational  management;  and \n(v) training  of  senior  ULB  and  utility  staff  in  the  evaluation  of  the  potential  opportunities  and \nbenefits of private sector participation, particularly within the context of management contracts. \n \nE.  \n \n11.   NERCCDIP will target end users through the implementation of a community education and \nawareness  program,  specifically  focusing  on  (i)  public  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  principles \n(and  the  reduction  of  discharge  into  drains/streams);  (ii)  waste  segregation  and  waste \nmanagement  (including  the  responsibilities  of  communities  for  the  safe  and  hygienic  disposal  of \nwaste  and  the  prevention  of  dumping  and  open  burning);  (iii)  introduction  to  and  enhanced \nunderstanding of tariffs to secure long-term quality service (sustainability), and taxpayer education \nprogram;  and  (iv)  improved  understanding  of  the  municipalization  process  among  traditional \nsocieties  and  how  both  systems  can  be  integrated  to  ensure  improved  service  delivery.  The \ncampaigns  will  also  present  NERCCDIP  objectives  and  will  seek  to  adequately  manage \nexpectations. \n\nIndividual Agency Employee Capacity \n\nEnd User or Beneficiary \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 20 May 2009) \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n \n$0.02092 \n \nRs47.779 \n", " \n \n", "Currency Unit \nRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCAA \nDEA \nDSMC \nEARF \nFFA \nFGIA \nFIRR \nIDC \nIEE \nIPCC \nIPDF \nIPEC \nJNNURM \nLIBOR \nMFF \nMOUD \nNEA \nNER \nNERCCDIP \nNGO \nNRW \nNSC \nO&M \nPFR \nPHED \nPMMC \nPSP \nSEA \nSGIA \nSIPMIU \nSOE \nSSC \nULB \nWSS \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank  \n\u2013  Constitutional Amendment Act \n\u2013  Department of Economic Affairs \ndesign, construction supervision, and management consultants \n\u2013 \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \n\u2013 \nframework financing agreement  \n\u2013 \nfirst-generation imprest account \n\u2013 \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013 \ninstitutional development consultant \n\u2013 \ninitial environmental examination  \n\u2013 \ninvestment program coordination cell \n\u2013 \nindigenous people development framework \n\u2013 \ninvestment program empowered committee \n\u2013 \nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013  multitranche financing facility \n\u2013  Ministry of Urban Development  \n\u2013 \nnational executing agency \n\u2013  North Eastern Region \n\u2013  North Eastern Region Capital Cities Development Investment Program \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  water supply and sanitation \n", "nongovernment organization \nnon-revenue water \nnational steering committee \noperation and maintenance  \nperiodic financing request \npublic health engineering department  \nprogram management and monitoring consultant \nprivate sector participation \nstate executing agency \nsecond-generation imprest account \nstate investment program management and implementation unit \nstatement of expenditures  \nstate steering committee \nurban local body \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of India ends on 31 March. \u201cFY\u201d before a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2009 ends \non 31 March 2009.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "X.
