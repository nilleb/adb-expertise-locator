Features that contribute to physical and material comfort or increase attractiveness \nor value. Rural amenities cover a wide range of resources such as built environments, natural or \nsemi  natural  habitats,  and  cultural  activities  of  significance,  as  well  as  the  human  skills  and \noccupations  associated  with  them.  The  utility  and  corresponding  value  that  rural  (and  urban) \npopulations derive from  these resources demand that rural amenities be considered important \nto rural development. \n \nBiological diversity. Defined in the Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992, as the variability \namong living organisms from all sources including, among others, terrestrial, marine, and other \naquatic  ecosystems  and  the  ecological  complexes  of  which  they  are  part.  The  term  includes \ndiversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. Biological diversity is commonly \nreferred to as biodiversity. \n \nBiosphere reserve. An area of terrestrial and coastal or marine ecosystems, or a combination \nthereof. Biosphere reserves are nominated by governments and remain under their jurisdiction. \nThey must meet a minimal set of criteria and adhere to a minimal set of conditions before being \nadmitted  to  the  World  Network  of  Biosphere  Reserves  of  the  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific,  and  Cultural  Organization.  Reserves  are  intended  to  fulfill  three  complementary \nfunctions:  (i)  a  conservation  function,  (ii)  a  development  function,  and  (iii)  a  logistic  function. \nBiosphere reserves contain one or more core areas that are securely protected sites, a clearly \nidentified buffer zone, and a flexible transition area. \n \n\n\f \n\nfor \n\nfunctions \n\nBuffer zone. A zone that usually surrounds or adjoins core areas, and is used for cooperative \nactivities  compatible  with  sound  ecological  practices,  including  environmental  education, \nrecreation,  ecotourism,  and  research.  In  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve,  a  buffer  zone  of \nabout  5,400  square  kilometers  (km2)  surrounds  the  core  areas  up  to  the  outer  limit  of  the \nflooded forest. \n \nCommune councils. In Cambodia, a body that governs commune administration. In addition to \nfulfilling  their  administrative  tasks,  they  engage  in  dispute  resolution,  plan  and  implement \nthe  central  and  provincial \ndevelopment  projects,  provide  some  agency \ngovernments,  and  conduct  advocacy.  Development  activities  consist  mainly  of  small-scale \ninfrastructure  and  public  goods  projects.  Every  commune  council  has  a  commune  chief,  who \nalso  acts  as  presiding  commune  councilor.  The  commune  chief  has  two  assistants,  a  first \ndeputy  chief  and  a  second  deputy  chief,  who  come  from  among  the  elected  councilors.  The \ncommune chief may also appoint advisory committees. \n \nCommunity  fisheries.  In  Cambodia,  (i)  a  form  of  co-management  in  which  a  community  of \npeople,  usually  a  village  or  group  of  villages,  is  recognized  and  empowered  as  a  co-\nmanagement  unit  for  fisheries;  and  (ii)  a  clearly  defined  and  demarcated  area  in  the  fisheries \ndomain  that  is  allocated  to  a  community  for  management.  The  sub-decree  on  community \nfisheries  management  defines  community  fisheries  as  a  group  of  persons  holding  Cambodian \ncitizenship  living  in  or  near  a  community  fishing  area,  voluntarily  established,  and  initiated  to \nimprove livelihoods by using fisheries resources sustainably  for economic development, social \nimprovement, and poverty reduction. \n \nCommunity  management.  The  community-based  management  of  local  natural  resources, \nincluding certain designated fishing areas, with support from relevant authorities, and institutions \nand organizations. \n \nCore areas. Securely protected sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed \necosystems,  and  undertaking  research  and  other  low-impact  uses  such  as  education.  In  the \nTonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve,  core  areas  are  in  Prek  Toal  (213  km2),  Battambang;  Boeng \nTonle  Chhmar  (Moat  Kla)  (145.6  km2),  Kompong  Thom;  and  Stung  Sen  (63.5  km2),  Kompong \nThom. They are characterized, respectively, by a flooded forest, streams and water bodies, and \nrich biodiversity. Nearly 100 water bird species are found there, a dozen of which are of global \nsignificance. The areas are also known for their fish, mammals, and reptiles. \n \nFisheries  domain.  A  body  of  water,  defined  by  law,  that  includes  practically  all  inland  waters \nexcept man-made ponds and reservoirs, as well as areas that are only temporarily aquatic such \nas the flooded forest. The Department of Fisheries is responsible for it. \n \nFishing gear. Any equipment used for fishing. More than 200 different types of gear are in use \non the Tonle Sap. They range from large-scale gear such as barrage traps and bagnets; middle-\nscale gear such as arrow-shaped traps, drift seine nets, rafted mounted lift nets, and scooping \nnets;  to  family-scale  gear  such  as  gill  nets,  small  traps,  single  long  lines,  small  dip  nets,  and \ncast nets. Almost all gear is developed locally. \n \nFishing  lots.  Exclusive  geographic  areas  that  are  awarded  through  a  competitive,  public \nbidding system for a period of 2 consecutive years, with the auction fee payable for each of the \ntwo fishing seasons. They range in size from 20 to 500 km2 and may include lake areas, river \nareas, and a flooded forest. The largest are found on the Tonle Sap. The operator of each lot \nhas the right to harvest fish according to the burden book for the lot. The burden book describes \n\n\f \n\nthe  open  season,  the  payment  schedule,  permissible  fishing  gears,  the  boundaries,  the  main \ngeographic  features,  and  the  designated  public  fishing  areas.  In  2000,  there  were  175  fishing \nlots  in  Cambodia,  covering  9,537  km2.  That  year,  as  a  result  of  conflict  between  lot  operators \nand communities over access to fisheries, about 56% of the area was transferred to community \nfisheries, leaving 82 lots covering 4,175 km2. \n \nFish sanctuaries. Water bodies set aside to protect fish stocks, improve fish recruitment, and \nprovide  dry  season  refuge  areas  for  nonmigratory  fish.  Year-round,  fishing  activities,  including \nsmall-scale  fishing,  are  prohibited.  Fishing  for  research  is  allowed.  Seven  of  the  eight \nsanctuaries on the Tonle Sap are inside the permanent lake, and one is near the mouth of the \nTonle Sap River. Most are found in the deeper parts of the lake. None is in the flooded forest. \n \nFlooded  forest.  A  descriptive  term  for  the  particular  natural  vegetation  that  originally  covered \nmost  of  the  Tonle  Sap's  floodplains.  It  is  now  characterized  by  low  forest  and  shrubs  that  still \naccount for the productivity of the Tonle Sap. \n \nInland fisheries. Divided into three legally recognized categories, on the basis of fishing gear \nand allocation of waters: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLarge-scale  fisheries.  Commercial  fisheries  that  use  such  gear  as  barrage \ntraps,  bagnets,  and  large  arrow-shaped  traps  in  fishing  lots.  Fishing  lots  are \nauctioned every 2 years. \nMedium-scale  fisheries.  Commercial  fisheries  that  use  such  gear  as  arrow \ntraps,  large  seine  nets,  and  large  gillnets.  Such  gear  can  be  deployed  only  in \nopen-access waters under license. \nSmall-scale  fisheries.  Subsistence  fisheries that  use  gear  such  as  nets,  traps, \nand  hooks.  Such  gear  requires  no  license.  Fishing  can  be  carried  out  in  all \ncategories  of  inland  fisheries,  except  within  fishing  lots  during  the  open  season \nand in protected areas. \n\n \nLivelihoods. The capabilities, assets, and activities required for a means of living. A livelihood \nis sustainable when it can cope with stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance itself in the \npresent and in the future without undermining the natural resource base. \n \nLivelihoods  approach.  A  way  of  thinking  about  the  objectives,  scope,  and  priorities  for \ndevelopment.  It  reinforces  positive  aspects  and  militates  against  constraints  or  negative \ninfluences. Its core principles are that poverty-focused development should be people-centered, \nresponsive, and participatory; multilevel; conducted in partnership; sustainable; and dynamic. It \nputs people at the center of development. \n \nSustainable  livelihoods  framework.  A  tool  to  improve  understanding  of  livelihoods.  It \nillustrates the main factors that affect people's livelihoods (e.g., access to assets; vulnerability; \npolicies,  institutions,  and  processes),  and  the  typical  relationships  between  these.  Livelihood \nassets  can  be  divided  into  five  types  of  capital:  (i)  human  capital,  e.g.,  skills,  knowledge,  and \nability  to  work;  (ii)  social  capital,  e.g.,  networks  and  connectedness,  formalized  groups,  and \nrelationships of trust; (iii) natural capital, e.g., natural resource stocks from which resource flows \nand  services  useful  for  livelihoods  are  derived;  (iv)  physical  capital,  e.g.,  transport,  shelter, \nbuildings,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  energy,  and  access  to  information  (communications); \nand (v) financial capital, e.g., available stocks and inflows of money. \n \nTransition  area.  An  area  in  which  stakeholders  work  together  in  a  variety  of  economic  and \nother activities to manage and develop sustainably a biosphere reserve's natural resources. In \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nthe Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve, a transition area of about 9,000 km2 lies between the outer \nboundary of the buffer zone and Highways No. 5 and No. 6. \n \n\nThe Tonle Sap at a Glance \n\nItem \n\nArea \n\nHydrology \n\nBiology \n\nSocioeconomy \n\nCharacteristic \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n250,000\u2013300,000 hectares (ha) in the dry season and 1.0\u20131.6 million ha in the wet \nseason \nThe flooded forest extended over more than 1 million ha originally, 614,000 ha in the \n1960s, 362,000 ha in 1991, and about 20,000 ha in 1997 \n1\u20132 meters above mean sea level in the dry season and 8\u201312 meters above mean sea \nlevel in the wet season \n20% of the Mekong River's floodwaters are absorbed by the Tonle Sap \n62% of the Tonle Sap's water originates from the Mekong River and 38% from the Tonle \nSap basin \nThe Tonle Sap is connected to the Mekong River by the 100-kilometer-long Tonle Sap \nRiver, which reverses its flow seasonally \nThe flooded forest contains about 200 plant species \nThe Tonle Sap contains at least 200 species of fish, 42 species of reptiles, 225 species \nof birds, and 46 species of mammals \n\n\u2022  Of the 500 fish species once found in Cambodia's wetlands, as many as 300 are now \n\nthought to have disappeared \n1.2 million people live in the area bordered by Highways No. 5 and No. 6 \nThe Tonle Sap yields about 230,000 tons of fish each year (about 50% of Cambodia's \ntotal freshwater capture fisheries production) \n\n\u2022  Rice production in the Tonle Sap's floodplains makes up about 12% of Cambodia's total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n\nNOTE \n\nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n\nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n\n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n\nL.

The summary \ninitial  environmental  examination  was  circulated  to  the  Board  on \n25 August 2005. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  community-driven  development  to  deliver \ndemand-driven  services  more  equitably,  efficiently,  and  effectively \n(output  1);  safeguard  the  core  areas  to  protect  their  functions, \nproducts,  and  attributes  (output  2);  and  build  skills  and  awareness \nfor  sustainable  livelihoods  to  strengthen  institutions  and  processes \nat  all  levels  (output  3).  It  will  benefit  people  in  the  communes  that \nare located either fully or partly in the buffer zone and core areas. \nSpecifically, the project area covers 37 communes surrounding the \nlake, in which there are 316 villages with a population of 287,430 in \n54,857 families. \n \nTackling  poverty  in  Cambodia  means  working  with  the  rural  poor, \ninitially where livelihood assets are being fundamentally affected by \nunfavorable  trends.  Such  trends  are  obvious  in  the  Tonle  Sap \nregion  of  Cambodia:  its  indicators  of  poverty  are  even  more \nnegative than those of the country as a whole. There, human capital \nhas been seriously affected by the extermination of a generation of \nleaders,  levels  of  health  and  education  are  low,  and  women \nshoulder  heavy  responsibilities  as  a  consequence  of  male  deaths \nduring  the  protracted  civil  war  and  genocide.  Social  capital  has \nbeen  severely  diminished  by  the  war  and  democratic  processes \nhave  only  recently  been  introduced.  Natural  capital,  especially \nforests  and  fish,  is  under  growing  human  exploitation.  Physical \ncapital  is  inadequate  and  there  are  few  rural  amenities.  Access  to \nfinancial capital is restricted: most loans are taken from relatives or \nneighbors,  and  moneylenders  charge  interest  rates  of  up  to  100% \nper  month.  The  structures  and  processes  that  affect  these  assets \nare  institutions,  policies,  legislation,  culture,  and  power  relations. \nThey determine access, terms of exchange, and returns; shape the \nlivelihood strategies of the poor; and govern their outcomes. All are \nweak.  The  asset  base  of  the  rural  poor  must  be  enhanced  and \ndeveloped.  Without  improvements,  investments  in  the  Tonle  Sap \nregion will become progressively less productive. \n \n\n \nRecipient \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nGrant Amount \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nThe Project will improve livelihoods.

The  Council \nfor  Agricultural  and  Rural  Development,  through  its  secretary \ngeneral,  will  head  a  project  steering  committee  established  to \nprovide  policy  and  strategy  guidance.  The  Ministry  of  Interior  will \nalso  act  as  Implementing  Agency  for  output  1.  The  Tonle  Sap \nBiosphere  Reserve  secretariat  in  the  Cambodia  National  Mekong \nCommittee  will  act  as  Implementing  Agency  for  output  2,  in  close \nconsultation  with  the  Department  of  Fisheries  in  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; the Inland  Fisheries Research \nand  Development  Institute  in  the  Department  of  Fisheries; and  the \nMinistry  of  Environment.  The  activities  for  output  3  have  been \ncomposed  to  promote  the  rapid  accomplishment  of  output  1.  They \nwill  be  implemented  by  the  Council  for  Agricultural  and  Rural \nDevelopment, \nthe  Ministry  of \nEnvironment. \n \n\nthe  Ministry  of \n\nInterior,  and \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nCivil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The civil works \nthat relate to output 1, such as water supply and sanitation, schools, \nand  small  village  works,  will  be  procured  through  local competitive \nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB where the cost is less than \n$500,000.  Vehicles,  machinery,  and  office  equipment  will  be \nprocured  through  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  from \n$100,000  to  $500,000  per  package  and  through  local  competitive \nbidding  where  the  cost  is  less  than  $100,000.  Procurement  of \ngoods  with  a  value  of  less  than  of  $50,000  can  be  made  through \ndirect purchase. Service contracts may be given to nongovernment \norganizations.  Commune  councils,  through  the  bidding  committee, \nwill procure the civil works, goods, and related services for eligible \nactivities.  Details  of  packages  for  procurement  will  be  determined \nduring project implementation. \n \nThe  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement \nof domestic consultants. The WorldFish Center of the Consultative \nGroup  on  International  Agricultural  Research  will  be  appointed  by \ndirect  selection \nto  accomplish  output  2.

Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nThe Nature of the Tonle Sap \n\n2. \nThe  Tonle  Sap  is  the  largest  freshwater  lake  in  Southeast  Asia,  covering  an  area  of \n2,500\u20133,000 square kilometers (km2) in the dry season. Owing to a hydrological phenomenon, \nthe Tonle Sap River draining the lake reverses its flow in the wet season when the waters of the \nMekong River flow into the lake to inundate 10,000\u201316,000 km2 for months. The wetlands born \nof this cycle are home to a high biodiversity of fish, reptile, bird, mammal, and plant species that \nqualified the Tonle Sap as a biosphere reserve in 1997. This biological richness is reflected in \nthe enormous productivity of the Tonle Sap as a fishing area: the lake supports one of the most \nproductive  fisheries  in  the  world,  and  provides  most  Cambodians  with  their  main  source  of \nanimal  protein,  calcium,  and  vitamin  A.1  The  fisheries,  together  with  the  flooded  forest  and \nagricultural lands of the inundated area, have underpinned human activity since ancient times.2 \nIndeed, the Tonle Sap and the associated heritage of Angkor have defined Cambodia's identity. \nToday,  the  land,  water,  and  biotic  resources  of  the  Tonle  Sap  directly  benefit  40%  of  the \npopulation  of  the  provinces  adjoining  the  lake  and  shore  up  food  security  and  employment \nelsewhere.3 The lake also benefits the lower Mekong basin as a feeding and spawning area for \nmigratory fish. It is of global significance for biodiversity conservation. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Threats to the Tonle Sap \n\n3. \nHowever,  in  Cambodia,  high  population  growth  is  increasing  the  number  of  people  to \nfeed and consumptive use of the Tonle Sap basin's natural resources is intense. Major threats \nto the Tonle Sap include overexploitation of fisheries and wildlife resources,4 particularly through \nthe  fishing  lot  system,5  conversion  of  the  flooded  forest  to  agriculture,  and  collection  of  fuel \nwood  from  the  flooded  forest.6  Widespread  deforestation  in  the  watersheds  is  destroying \nhabitats,  impairing  water  and  soil  quality,  and  increasing  siltation  rates.  And  so,  despite  the \ninherent richness of the lake, indicators of poverty in the basin are even more negative than in \nthe country as a whole. Outside Cambodia, the main concern is the cumulative impact of built \nstructures on the hydrology of the Mekong basin. \n                                                 \n1  Fish consumption rates can exceed 80 kilograms per capita per year. (The national average is 25\u201330 kilograms.) \n2  They are believed to contribute more to national food security than they do in other countries. (Their contribution to \ngross domestic product has been reassessed at 16%. The value of the catch is estimated at $200 to $300 million.) \n3  The  fisheries  are  an  irreplaceable  source  of  food  and  livelihoods  for  about  2  million  Cambodians.  They  give \nopportunities to (i) diversify activities and ensure against crop failures, (ii) optimize labor among different activities \nin different seasons, (iii) access an income-generating activity  with very little capital and no requirement for land, \nand (iv) maintain or improve nutrition, as fresh and processed fish represent a significant source of protein. \n\n4  Many species are on the 2004 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122. Twelve are listed under the Convention on \nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 1979. Attention was drawn to the high rates of \nextraction in ADB. 2004. Cambodia: Country Environmental Analysis. Manila. \n\n5  The  fishing  lot  system  was  introduced  in  colonial  times  and  has  dominated  inland  fisheries  ever  since.  It  is  a \n\npotentially powerful management tool. But it has become increasingly inequitable, divisive, and destructive. \n\n6  The  area  of  flooded  forest  is  declining  rapidly.  In  1997,  satellite  imagery  revealed  only  about  20,000  hectares  of \nflooded forest, compared with 362,000 hectares in 1991, 614,000 hectares in the 1960s, and more than 1 million \nhectares originally. \n\n\f2 \n\n3. \n\nPoverty and Vulnerability \n\n4. \nDespite  the  richness  of  its  natural  resources,  the  Tonle  Sap  provides  an  inadequate \nliving for most of the inhabitants of the provinces that adjoin it as more compete for livelihood \nassets. Indicators of poverty are more negative than for the population as a whole or, indeed, for \nother  rural  areas:  between  40%  and  60%  of  the  households  in  half  of  the  villages,  and  about \n80%  in  other  areas,  are  below  the  poverty  line.  Many  communities  own  no  land  and  depend \nentirely  on  fishing  and  foraging,  with  access  to  fishing  areas  often  under  dispute.  Such  is  the \ndependence of the rural poor on natural resources and the subsistence nature of their livelihood \nstrategies that they have little to fall back on if things go wrong. \n \n5. \nMore than elsewhere in Cambodia, health shocks and chronic illness are major causes \nof  impoverishment.  The  cycle  of  poverty,  ill  health,  and  high  health-care  expenditure  by \nhouseholds (11% of household income) cripples families. Since people frequently rely on pond \nwater  for  drinking,  children  suffer  from  repeated  attacks  of  diarrhea.  Malaria,  dengue  fever, \nacute respiratory infections, and tuberculosis are endemic, and the rate of HIV/AIDS infection is \nthe  highest  in  the  region.  About  45%  of  the  people  borrow  to  cover  the  cost  of  health \nemergencies  and,  all  too  often,  respond  to  health  shocks  by  removing  children  from  schools, \nstarting with girls. Half of the children under the age of 5 are malnourished and, for every 1,000 \nlive births, 115 children die before they reach the age of 5. \n \n6. \nAdult literacy averages 63%. (This figure is inflated as it includes the partially literate and \nhides wide provincial and gender differences.) About 70% of children do not complete primary \nschool,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  60%.  Twice  as  many  women  as  men  over  15 \nyears of age have never attended school. Lack of education limits the ability to recognize and \nact on opportunities. Interestingly, however, a high demand exists for technical and vocational \neducation and training. Low literacy levels, lack of access to environmental education materials, \nand  a  dearth  of  basic  information\u2014such  as  copies  of  laws,  sub-decrees,  proclamations, \ndirectives, and circulars\u2014do not favor decision making for natural resource management. \n \n7. \nWomen  are  very  vulnerable.  They  have  even  less  access than  men  to  land  ownership \nand  other  property  rights,  credit,  paid  employment,  education,  and  health  services.  They  also \nhave few opportunities for self-development or participation in community decision making since \nKhmer tradition ascribes a passive role to women. Nevertheless, the gender division of labor is \nchanging  overall:  women  and  men  play  progressively  interchangeable  roles  because  women \nare  increasingly  called  upon  to  meet  household  needs.  There  are  also  many  displaced  or \ndisabled  persons,  who  suffer  from  poverty  and  other  forms  of  social  deprivation  to  an  even \ngreater extent than the rest of the population. \n \n8. \nThe  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  are  the  Vietnamese  and  Muslim \nCham.  Even  though  most  of  the  Vietnamese  were  born  in  Cambodia,  they  are  not  Khmer \npeople and are classified as immigrants. This status limits their contribution to community-based \nnatural resource management, despite the fact that they are innovative fishers. The Cham, who \nare  also  fishers,  do  not  experience  segregation.  But  all  ethnic  minorities  are  disadvantaged \nbecause  of  inadequate  representation  at  management  and  legislative  levels.  The  Vietnamese \nare further deprived by lack of property rights and language barriers. \n \n9. \nIn  the  wet  season,  heavy  swells  and  high  waves  can  topple  the  houses  of  the \ncommunities that live on the Tonle Sap. The inhabitants pay to have their houses towed to new \nanchorage sites to accommodate the changing water levels and move into sheltered locations. \nThese and other costs related to repairing damage to the houses account for as much as a third \n\n\f3 \n\nof annual expenditure. Indebtedness is high and returns for labor are low as most poor fishers \nare locked into a system of borrowing and selling to middlemen. Microfinance is rarely available. \nFurther, absence of clean water and sanitation leads to morbidity and low life expectancy. \n \nIn the lowlands, rural life is intrinsically linked to the natural, annual cycle of flooding. The \n10. \ncommunities have developed coping mechanisms to live with flooded conditions, often for up to \n6  months  a  year.  But  when  floods  are  deeper  than  normal,  unexpectedly  fast  at  onset,  or \nunusually prolonged, they can tax community self-reliance and capacity to cope. \n \n11. \nPoverty is also related to extended instability and conflict and the resultant harm to the \npopulation.  Most  of  Cambodia  experienced  more  peace  and  economic  growth  after  1993  but \nonly since 1998 have areas northwest of the Tonle Sap enjoyed their first real respite from war. \nMany  internally  displaced  persons,  repatriated  refugees,  internal  migrants,  and  demobilized \nsoldiers are reestablishing livelihoods in what remains a fractured society. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nLivelihood Outcomes \n\nPoverty and vulnerability are caused by declining access to assets.7 Human capital has \n12. \nbeen  seriously  affected  by  the  extermination  of  a  generation  of  leaders,  health  and  education \nare poor, and women shoulder heavy responsibilities as a consequence of male deaths during \nthe  protracted  civil  war  and  genocide.  Social  capital  has  been  severely  diminished  by  the  war \nand  democratic  processes  have  only  recently  been  introduced.  Natural  capital,  especially \nforests and fish, is under growing human exploitation. Physical capital is inadequate and there \nare  few  rural  amenities.8  Access  to  financial  capital  is  restricted:  most  loans  are  taken  from \nrelatives or neighbors, and moneylenders charge interest rates of up to 100% per month. The \nstructures  and  processes  that  affect  these  assets  are  institutions,  policies,  legislation,  culture, \nand  power  relations.  They  determine  access,  terms  of  exchange,  and  returns;  shape  the \nlivelihood strategies of the poor; and govern their outcomes. All are weak (Appendix 1). \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Government's Response \n\n13. \nThe  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve.  In  recognition  of  the  lake's  importance,  a  royal \ndecree  designated  the  Tonle  Sap  as  a  multiple-use  protected  area  in  1993.  Furthermore,  the \nlake  was  declared  a  biosphere  reserve  in  1997 under  the  Man  and  the Biosphere  Program  of \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The institution of the Tonle \nSap  Biosphere  Reserve  (TSBR),  which  entails  adherence  to  core  area,  buffer  zone,  and \ntransition  area  zoning  principles,  should  lead  to  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of \nnatural resources and biodiversity. But its management is a great challenge for the Government \nand  few  practical  measures  have  been  implemented  since  to  protect  the  reserve.  The \nGovernment needs to practice the tenets of biosphere reserve zoning: the existence of fishing \nlots in the core areas is the clearest example of failure to turn commitment into action. \n \nCommunity Fisheries. In 2000, a prime ministerial decree released 56% of the fishing \n14. \nlot area and turned it over to community fisheries. In the long term, this change should benefit \n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n8  Attention to rural amenities, e.g., schools, health posts, communal facilities, water supply and sanitation, or roads, \nis strongly justified for reasons of economic efficiency, social equity, cultural diversity, and sound management of \nnatural resources and the environment. \n\n\f4 \n\ncommunities, improve fish habitats, and lead to sustainable management of natural resources. \nBut  the  reform  process  was  driven  by  decree.  It  was  not  the  result  of  policy  planning  and \ncommunities were not involved. As a result, the boundaries of community fisheries sometimes \nneed  readjusting;  communities  are  still  trying  to  organize  themselves  in  the  absence  of \nlegislation;9  and  they  have  insufficient  funds  with  which  to  prepare  and  implement  community \nfisheries  management  plans.  The  reform  process  also  burdens  the  Department  of  Fisheries \n(DOF) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, which has low capacity. \n \nDecentralization  and  Deconcentration.  In  2001,  to  achieve  democratization  at  the \n15. \ngrassroots, the Government embarked on a process of decentralization and deconcentration.10 \nIt formulated a subnational governance system that is intended to be democratic, participatory, \naccountable, effective, efficient, and pro-poor. The reform process culminated in the election of \ncommune  councils  in  2002  and  a  three-tier  institutional  structure  with  central,  provincial,  and \ncommune  levels.  The  national  treasury  now  transfers  funds  to  commune  council  accounts, \nwhich are administered by provincial treasuries. These funds are to be used for administrative \nexpenditures  (30%)  and  development  (70%).11  Decentralization  and  deconcentration  should \nafford  opportunities  to  embed  peace  and  democracy  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region  as  elsewhere, \nincrease  accountability  and  transparency,  and  enhance  pro-poor,  participatory  development. \nCambodians are generally well satisfied with the performance of their commune council.12 What \nremains  to  be  done  is  to  ensure  efficient,  effective,  and  relevant  use  of  increased  commune \nfunds13  to  improve  livelihood  outcomes,  especially  through  investment  in  social  infrastructure, \nenterprise development, and support for community fisheries. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Tonle Sap Initiative14 \n\nIn  2003,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  drafted  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Strategy,15 \n16. \ngiving  geographical  focus  to  ADB's  Country  Strategy  and  Program,  2005\u20132009.  It  forms  the \nbasis  for  setting  priorities  and  planning  assistance  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  over  the  next  5\u201310 \nyears. It gives focus and direction to external assistance to the Tonle Sap region (Appendix 2). \nThe Tonle Sap Initiative16 will accomplish the Tonle Sap Basin Strategy through a suite of highly \nintegrated  loan,  grant,  and  technical  assistance  projects.  In  the  Tonle  Sap  basin,  the \ndevelopment objectives are to foster, promote, and facilitate (i) pro-poor, sustainable economic \ngrowth,  (ii)  access  to  assets,  and  (iii)  management  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment. \nThe  strategy  is  based  on  three  underpinning  principles:  (i)  sustainable  livelihoods,  (ii)  social \njustice, and (iii) a basin-wide approach. It focuses on two areas: (i) rural development and the \nenvironment, and (ii) human development. Its crosscutting themes ensure that attention is paid \nto vulnerable groups, governance, resource cooperation, and the private sector. The threats to \nthe Tonle Sap must be considered from the perspective of the basin as a whole, but everything \n\n                                                 \n9   The draft Fisheries Law awaits passage in the national assembly. The Council of Ministers expects this to happen \n\nbefore the Cambodia Consultative Group meeting scheduled in December 2005. \n\n10  Decentralization  is  delegation  of  political  and  administrative  authority  to  the  commune  level.  Deconcentration  is \n\ndelegation of administrative authority from central ministries to provincial departments or district offices. \n\n11  Commune councils are required to collect local contributions to cover at least 10% of the cost of their development \n\nprojects. \n\n12 The  Asia  Foundation.  2005.

Therefore,  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  has  important  tactics: \n(i) geographical  phasing  of  interventions;  (ii)  development  of  the  institutional,  policy,  and \nregulatory  framework;  (iii)  acquisition  and  dissemination  of  knowledge;  (iv)  enabling  of \nstakeholders;  and  (vi)  forging  of  partnerships.  These  should  present  opportunities  to  reduce \npoverty and vulnerability. \n \nThe Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project (TSEMP)17 was the first intervention. \n17. \nIts  outcome  is  to  be  enhanced  systems  and  developed  capacity  for  natural  resource \nmanagement coordination and planning, community-based natural resource management, and \nbiodiversity  conservation  in  the  TSBR.  The  Commune  Council  Development  Project  is  closely \nallied.18  The  present  Project  will  build  on  both,  and  on  other  grant  and  technical  assistance \nprojects of the Tonle Sap Initiative, in harmony with the Government's Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth,  Employment,  Equity,  and  Efficiency.19  Above  all,  the  Project  will  support  community-\ndriven development to bridge the end of the Seila program20 and its assimilation.21 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe Project will improve livelihoods. It will increase access to assets in the five provinces \nthat  adjoin  the  Tonle  Sap  (Appendix  3).22  The  project  area  encompasses  the  buffer  zone  and \ncore  areas.  Specifically,  it  covers  37  communes,  comprising  316  villages  with  a  population  of \n287,430 in 54,857 families. These communes qualify because they pursue livelihood activities in \nthe buffer zone.23 \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nCommunity-Driven Development Is Supported \n\n19. \nThe  purpose  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration  is  to  devolve  responsibilities, \nfunctions, and power to the lowest practicable structural level to deliver demand-driven services \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project. Manila. \n\n18 ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Cambodia for the Commune Council Development Project. Manila. \n\n19 The  strategy  has  four  goals:  (i)  economic  growth,  (ii)  employment  generation,  (iii)  improved  governance,  and \n(iv) accelerated implementation of reforms in all sectors to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. \n20 Seila means \"foundation stone.\" It is the name given to the 10-year-old trial approach to decentralized development \nplanning,  financing,  and  implementation.  The  Seila  program's  support  structures  were  rolled  out  to  all  provinces \nfollowing the election of commune councils in 2002. The result is a successful system of local government at the \ncommune  level.  The  Seila  program  will  be  wound  down  by  the  end  of  2006.  Its  support  structures  are  being \nintegrated  into  those  proposed  in  the  Government's  strategic  framework  for  decentralization  and  deconcentration \nover a period of transition of about 5 years, the most intensive of which are the next 2. \n\n21 The poor are prime actors in the development process, not targets of externally designed poverty reduction efforts. \nIn community-driven development, control of decisions and resources rests with communities. Studies have shown \nthat  community-driven  development,  especially  by  means  of  social  funds,  can  increase  the  relevance, \neffectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of projects or programs by making them more pro-poor and responsive \nto local priorities. The scaling up of such projects or programs, however, hinges on the successful embedding of \nstructures and processes in the country's social fabric. A \"learning by doing\" culture\u2014one that values adaptation, \nflexibility, and openness to change\u2014needs to be fostered at all levels. \n\n22  They are Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. \n23 Fifty-seven communes have some land in the buffer zone. The 37 target communes are of two types: (i) 21 have \nvillages  in  the  buffer  zone,  and  (ii)  16  have  community  fisheries  and  some  land  area,  but  no  villages,  inside  the \nbuffer zone. The 20 excluded communes have land but neither villages nor community fisheries in the buffer zone. \n\n\f6 \n\nmore equitably, efficiently, and effectively. The first driver of success is availability of finance to \nthe  decentralized  bodies.  This  is  being  achieved  by  direct  transfer  of  capital  from  central \ngovernment to the commune/sangkat fund (C/SF)24 managed by the commune councils. But the \namounts involved are small and so, under the Seila program, the C/SF has been augmented by \nthe donor community. The second driver of success is ability to plan and manage disbursement \nto improve livelihood outcomes. \n \n\na. \n\nEstablish a Community Livelihood Fund \n\n20. \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  community  livelihood  fund  (CLF)  to  finance  small-scale \ncommunity-driven activities planned and agreed on at village and commune levels. The CLF will \nbe managed by MOI, and the 37 communes in the project area will be able to access CLF grant \nfunds  through  their  Commune  Councils.25  The  planning  of  the  activities  will  follow  the \nprocedures  of  the  Commune  Development  Plan.26  The  Project  will  make  allocations  from  the \nCLF to 37 individual communal funds. The allocations will be channeled to a commercial bank \naccount  for  each  commune  at  the  district  level.  Eligible  activities  will  relate  to  (i)  social \ninfrastructure,27 (ii) income-generating activities, and (iii) support for community fisheries. Limits \nwill  be  set  on  the  allocation  to  each  category  (Appendix  4).  Community  livelihood  facilitation \nteams (CLFTs) will be established in each project province in the office of the governor.28 \n \n\nb. \n\nDesign and Implement Livelihood Investment Packages \n\n21. \nThe Project will integrate the planning of activities to be funded through the CLF with the \nestablished process of village and commune planning. However, village-level planning needs to \nbe  supported,  particularly  in  the  less  familiar  income-generating  and  community  fisheries \nactivities,  and  activities  to  ensure greater  participation  of women  and  the  more  disadvantaged \nhouseholds.  To  this  end,  the  Project  will  assist  demand-based  organizations  including \ncommunity fisheries in formulating proposals for funding under the CLF. It will also help to form \nvillage or commune special interest groups.29 It is accepted that in the first update of the 3-year \nrolling  commune  development  plans  in  which  the  Project  will  be  involved  there  will  be  little \nchange  particularly  in  social  infrastructure.30  However,  at  that  stage,  community  fisheries  that \nare being organized under component 2 of the TSEMP may be formulating plans for funding. \n \n22. \nVillage-based  proposals  will  be  passed  through  to  the  commune  councils  via  the \ncommune planning and budgeting committees (CPBCs) for inclusion in the annual update of the \ncommune  development  plans.  The  commune  councils  may  choose  specifically  to  earmark \nindividual items for funding under the CLF; other items may be included with other proposals put \n                                                 \n24  Provinces  are  divided  into  districts  and  communes.  Municipalities  are  divided  into  khan  and  sangkat.  There  are \nnow  20  provinces,  4  municipalities,  171  districts,  14  khan,  1,510  communes,  and  111  sangkat.  The  C/SF  was \nestablished  in  2001  to  provide  Commune/Sangkat  Councils  with  predictable  and  transparent  fiscal  transfers  for \ndevelopment spending. \n\n25  The range of eligible activities was decided based on participatory rural appraisals during project preparation. \n26  The commune development plan is a 3-year rolling plan with annual updates derived from proposals put forward by \nindividual  villages  working  through  their  representatives  on  the  commune  planning  and  budgeting  committees. \nIndividual  commune  development  plans  are  passed  to  a  district  integration  workshop  at  which  line  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, and donors pledge support. Components of the plans that are not adopted  will be \nconsidered for direct funding through the C/SF. \n\n27 Construction of small piped water supply systems, wells, or intra-village roads may entail minor acquisition of land. \n\nA land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared to guide planning and implementation. \n\n28  Emphasis will be placed on improving the quality of facilitation services to commune planning. The facilitation will \n\ninclude a discussion of what are, and what are not, pro-poor outcomes. \n29  Special interest groups will include women's groups and ethnic minorities. \n30  Experience under the Seila program shows that commune development plans tend to focus on this. \n\n\f7 \n\nforward  to  the  district  integration  workshops  and,  if  not  selected  for  funding  through  other \nsources at that forum, would be reconsidered for funding under the CLF. \n \n23. \nThe Project will set guidelines to which all proposals for activities to be funded through \nthe CLF will conform.31 The guidelines will indicate the technical support needed to ensure that \nactivities are properly implemented, and this support will be contracted to government agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  or  the  private  sector.  The  Project  will  also  contract \nindependent  auditors  to  verify  project  accounts  and  financial  transactions.  Additionally,  the \nprovincial offices of economy and finance will audit the CLF each year. \n \n\n2. \n\nCore Areas Are Safeguarded \n\nThe  core  areas  are  reservoirs  of  natural  capital  that  strengthen  the  Tonle  Sap's \n24. \nresilience  in  the  face  of  ever-increasing  pressures  and  contribute  directly  to  fisheries \nproductivity.  Protecting  their  functions,  products,  and  attributes  will  contribute  appreciably  to \nsustainable  livelihoods.  The  fishing  lots  that  overlap,  sometimes  totally,  with  the  core  areas \nprovide  a  degree  of  protection  of  sorts  but  they  compromise  their  conservation  function:  they \nmaximize  the  fish  harvest  and  private  economic  rent  with  no  regard  for  sustainability.32 \nImplementing a robust core area management system depends on a solid understanding of the \nbiological functions of the core areas (as well as sanctuaries) in the broader lake ecosystem; the \ndynamics of resource use and the livelihood strategies of the population of the core areas;33 and \nan  effective  management  framework  for  the  core  areas.  DOF  endorses  the  strategy  of  doing \naway  with  fishing  lots  in  the  core  areas  in  favor  of  establishing  fish  sanctuaries  and  a \nmanagement  system  compatible  with  biodiversity  conservation.  The  fishing  lot  licenses  in  the \ncore areas, which will expire in 2009, will not be extended. \n \n\na. \n\nEstablish an Information Base on Core Areas \n\nThe Project will (i) review and describe the operations of fishing lots in the core areas, \n25. \n(ii) establish a database of biological and socioeconomic information as a subset of the TSBR \nenvironmental  information  database,  and  (iii)  build  the  capacity  of  the  TSBR  secretariat  in  the \nCambodia National Mekong Committee to manage the information base. \n\nb. \n\nInstitute a Management System for Core Areas \n\n26. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  establish  the  position  of  core  areas  coordinator  in  the  TSBR \nsecretariat; (ii) assist the TSBR secretariat to develop, conclude, and implement a management \nand  protection  agreement  for  the  core  areas  between  the  Cambodia  National  Mekong \nCommittee,  DOF,  the  Inland  Fisheries  Research  and  Development  Institute  (IFREDI)  in  DOF, \nand  the  Ministry  of  Environment  (MOE);  (iii)  detail  a  plan  and  schedule  for  the  removal  of  the \nfishing lots,34 with reference to activities under component 3 of the TSEMP; (iv) select the best \nway to maximize the conservation of natural resources in the core areas;35 (v) identify all current \nclasses  of  direct  users\u2014seasonal  and  others\u2014of  the  core  areas  and  prepare  a  livelihoods \n\n                                                 \n31  Activities must be demonstrably free of negative effects on the environment and cultural heritage. They must not \ndisadvantage  or  cause  losses  to  any  part  of  the  community.  Activities  for  which  there  are  potentially  negative \nenvironmental  effects  may  nevertheless  be  retained  subject  to  the  findings  of  a  competent  environmental  impact \nassessment. The TSBR secretariat will be the arbiter of such cases. \n\n32 They are lot no. 2 in Prek Toal; lots no. 4, no. 5, and no. 6 around Boeng Tonle Chhmar; and lot no. 1 in Stung \n\nSen. License to exploit these fishing lots until 31 May 2009 has been granted. \n\n33  Only Boeng Tonle Chhmar is populated. In July 2004, it was home to 2,218 people. \n34  The mechanism will be applicable to any additional core areas that may be identified. \n35  This might include various levels of spatial or temporal restriction of access. \n\n\f8 \n\ndevelopment  and  support  plan  identifying  (a)  priority  interventions  in  support  of  livelihoods  for \npoorer  groups  that  might  be  affected  by  the  removal  of  the  fishing  lots,  and  (b)  activities  to \nembed  the  protection  and  management  of  the  core  areas  in  the  livelihoods  of  neighboring \ncommunities;  (vi)  identify  and  recommend  alternative  livelihoods  for  the  population  of  Boeng \nTonle  Chhmar,  whose  right  of  abode  is  maintained  under  the  Royal  Decree  on  the \nEstablishment and Management of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve,36 and who will be allowed \nto  continue  using  the  natural  resources  of  the  core  areas  in  ways  that  respect  the  protection \nobjectives of the core areas; (vii) assess, with reference to activities under component 3 of the \nTSEMP,  the  operations  of  the  fishing  lots  and  recommend  mitigation  measures  to  DOF  for \nimmediate  action  and  inclusion  in  the  burden  books  of  the  lots;  (viii)  plan  and  propose  a  new \nmanagement system for core areas, and its monitoring and evaluation; (ix) identify, jointly with \nDOF, IFREDI, and MOE mechanisms to ensure compliance;37 and (x) propose the incorporation \nof the additional potential core areas identified under component 3 of the TSEMP. \n \n\nc. \n\nInstitute an Improved Network of Fish Sanctuaries \n\nThe Project will (i) assess the function of fish sanctuaries vis-\u00e0-vis fish productivity in the \n27. \nTonle  Sap;38  (ii)  determine  the  optimum  number,  location,  and  size  of  fish  sanctuaries;  and \n(iii) formulate recommendations for their use and management. \n \n\n3. \n\nSkills and Awareness for Sustainable Livelihoods are Built \n\n28. \nDecentralization and deconcentration have boosted local autonomy and participation in \nnational  development.  Accordingly,  the  structures  supporting  this  effort\u2014at  central,  provincial, \ndistrict,  and  commune  levels\u2014have  received  considerable  assistance.  But,  given  their  short \nhistory,  the  impact  on  improved  livelihoods,  though  encouraging,  has  been  modest:  there \nremains  a  need  to  strengthen  institutions  and  processes  at  all  levels.  This  includes  improving \ncross-sectoral \nfor  community-driven \nin  development  planning,  building  skills \ndevelopment, and raising awareness of the need to protect natural resources. \n \n\nlinkages \n\na. \n\nImprove Coordination for Community-Driven Development \n\nThe  Project  will  (i)  recommend  the  institutional  arrangements,  including  the  role, \n29. \nfunctions,  terms  of  reference,  structure,  budget,  and  staff  complement,  that  would  enable  the \nCouncil  for  Agricultural  and  Rural  Development  (CARD)  to  better  coordinate  with  ministries, \nfacilitate  policy  formulation,  and  harmonize  external  assistance  for  agricultural  and  rural \ndevelopment,  (ii)  draw  up  a  work  plan  and  train  staff  of  CARD  to  update  it;  and  (iii)  build  the \ncapacity of CARD to complete critical tasks effectively, efficiently, and more inclusively. \n \n\nb. \n\nEnhance the Skills Base for Community-Driven Development \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  familiarize  government  institutions  at  central,  provincial,  and  commune \nlevels  with  the  CLF.  This  will  entail  preparing  a  range  of  materials  for  awareness-raising \nactivities  covering  the  objective  of  the  CLF,  its  scope,  and  the  means  of  accessing  it.  The \n\n                                                 \n36  Those measures would be based on a series of stakeholder and community consultations and surveys to identify \nsocially  acceptable  options  and  tradeoffs.  The  consultations  would  also  serve  the  important  function  of  building \nlegitimacy for the rules once they are implemented. \n\n37  This  involves  defining  the  roles  of  various  government  and  local  institutions,  and  also  designing  community \ninstitutions to enforce measures at the community level. MOE would be the main management authority, and the \nTSBR Secretariat would approve recommended enforcement mechanisms. \n\n38  The fish sanctuaries referred to are the eight protected areas of the Tonle Sap under the jurisdiction of DOF. \n\n\f9 \n\nprincipal modes of delivery will be group discussions, workshops, and audio-visual materials.39 \nA project information center will be set up in each project province.40 \n \n31. \nStaff  of  the  provincial  departments  of  rural  development,  environment,  and  women's \naffairs,  and  the  provincial  office  of  fisheries  assigned  to  the  CLFTs  or  otherwise  involved  in \nproject  implementation  will  receive  formal  training  in  participatory  development  planning  and \nperformance management based on the Project's design and monitoring framework. Staff of the \nprovincial  offices  of  economy  and  finance  will  be  trained  in  specific  auditing  requirements. \nTraining in operations and financial accountability will be given to members of the CPBCs and to \nthe  accountants  of  the  commune  councils.41  The  commune  facilitators  will  be  trained  in  the \nparticipatory analysis of livelihood needs and opportunities and the mobilization of communities \nfor deeper involvement in sustainable development planning, implementation, and performance \nevaluation. \n \n32. \nTraining modules specifying content, inputs, outputs, and costs will be prepared by the \nCLFTs.  Their  delivery  will  be  contracted  to  service  providers.  The  training  will  develop,  within \nprovincial  line  agency  staff,  commune  councils,  and  village-level  organizations,  the  ability  to \nconduct inclusive, community-driven development planning. \n \n\nc. \n\nEducate for Protection of Natural Resources \n\n33. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  assemble  educational  materials  on  natural  resource  management, \nincluding those developed under component 3 of the TSEMP; (ii) hold environmental awareness \nforums  for  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries,  MOE,  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment, Ministry of Women's Affairs, their provincial departments, and commune leaders; \n(iii)  prioritize  villages  according  to  their  potential  impact  on  resource  extraction;  (iv)  assemble, \ntrain, and equip a mobile training team to extend environmental awareness in priority villages; \n(v)  deliver  the  environmental  awareness  program;  and  (vi)  conduct  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nThe  activities  will  build  on  achievements  under  component  1  of  the  TSEMP,  according  to  the \nprinciples developed under an ADB-assisted pilot and demonstration activity.42 \n \n\nC. \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\n34. \nAs  a  poor,  debt-stressed  country,  Cambodia  is  eligible  for  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF)  grant  financing  of  up  to  50%  of  its  ADB  lending  program,  as  spelled  out  in  the  ADF  IX \nDonors' Report, Development Effectiveness for Poverty Reduction. It is recommended that ADB \nprovide  the  Project  with  $15,000,000  grant  financing  from  the  ADF  IX  grant  facilities.  Special \njustifications  include  the  Project's  close  alignment  with  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  and  the \nGovernment's Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, as well as \nthe Project's unequivocal intention to harness community-driven development to reduce poverty \nand vulnerability in one of the poorest regions of Cambodia. \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nGrassroots Funding. The Project will bridge the gap in access to finance by improving \n35. \nthe  sectoral  allocation  and  geographic  balance  of  public  investment.  There  is  no  generic \n                                                 \n39  These  will  include  posters  and  video  presentations  in  the  language  or  dialect  of  the  target  audience.  Specific \n\ninformation materials will also be prepared for the illiterate and semi-literate. \n\n40  These will normally be included in the office of the CLFTs. \n41  Accounting and procurement systems for the CLF will be formulated at the start of project implementation. \n42 ADB. 2003.

The Government of Cambodia will contribute $600,000, or 3% of the total project cost, \nfrom local sources (Appendix 5). The financing plan is in Table 2. \n\n                                                 \n43  Cambodia's  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  Tonle  Sap  are  embodied  in  more  than  10  treaties  and  conventions.

One of the core areas of the TSBR, Boeng Tonle Chhmar, was \ndesignated as one of the country's three Ramsar sites in 1999. \n\n44  The goals of the Seville Strategy for Biosphere Reserves are to (i) use biosphere reserves to conserve natural and \ncultural  diversity;  (ii)  use  biosphere  reserves  as  models  of  land  management  and  of  approaches  to  sustainable \ndevelopment;  (iii)  use  biosphere  reserves  for  research,  monitoring,  education,  and  training;  and  (iv)  implement  the \nbiosphere reserve concept. \n\n45 The allocation of grant proceeds in the Grant Agreement will be presented in US dollars, with reference only to total \nexpenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach. \n\n\f11 \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan ($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n4.0 \n2.8 \n0.1 \n6.9 \n\n11.0 \n1.9 \n0.5 \n13.4 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n15.0 \n4.7 \n0.6 \n20.3 \n\n% \n\n74 \n23 \n3 \n100 \n\n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Finland \nGovernment of Cambodia \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe Ministry of Interior (MOI) will act as Executing Agency (Appendix 6).46 In the context \n39. \nof  decentralization  and  deconcentration,47  MOI  has  been  tasked  with  building  the  central  and \nlocal institutions that will support the operation of the entire sub-national system of governance \nand  implementing  the  related  capacity-building  effort.  While  the  Project  will  be  executed \npredominantly  at  the  commune  level  and  rely  on  the  decentralized  structures  strengthened \nunder the Seila program, at the central level MOI plays a leading role in decentralization. MOI's \nmain  functions  will  be  setting  overall  project  direction,  resolving  implementation  problems, \nreviewing project progress and performance against milestones (with reporting every 6 months), \nensuring flow of funds to the communes48 and timely and adequate counterpart funding by the \nGovernment, and carrying out certain procurement under outputs 1 and 3. \n \n40. \nThe  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  will  assist  MOI  in  the  smooth  transfer  of \nfunds  from  the  central  to  the  commune  levels.  MEF  has  already  created  a  local  finance \ndepartment to provide assistance and monitor the performance of sub-national administrations \nin  the  management  of  local  finances.  The  Project  will  assign  a  domestic  consultant  to \nstrengthen  its  operations.  MEF  also  led  the  task  force  that  drafted  guidelines,  standard \noperating  procedures,  and  detailed  instructions  for  financial  management  and  procurement \nunder donor-assisted projects.49 These guidelines, procedures, and instructions are expected to \nbe formally approved by the Government in 2005, and the Project will provide an opportunity to \napply them on a limited basis. \n \n41. \nCARD, through its secretary general, will head a project steering committee established \nto provide policy and strategy guidance.50 CARD will also communicate project outcomes to the \nCouncil  of  Ministers.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year.  An  international \nconsultant will assist CARD intermittently. \n \n\n                                                 \n46 MOI is the Executing Agency for the Commune Council Development Project. \n47  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  2005.  Strategic  Framework  for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration  Reforms. \n\nPhnom Penh. \n\n48  First-  and  second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  opened  at  the  central  level  for  this  purpose  (see \n\nDisbursement Arrangements section below). \n\n49  This  reflects  the  commitment  made  by  Cambodia  to  implement  the  \"Declaration  by  the  Royal  Government  of \nCambodia  and  Development  Partners  on  Harmonization  and  Alignment\"  (December  2004),  and  thereby  improve \nthe management of external assistance. \n\n50  The project steering committee will include the Cambodia National Mekong Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry, and Fisheries, MEF, MOE, MOI, the Ministry of Rural Development, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs. \nOther ministries can join upon request. \n\n\f12 \n\n42.  MOI will also be the Implementing Agency for output 1. The commune-level committees \nand  working  bodies  that  were  strengthened  under  the  Seila  program  have  been  enshrined  in \nlegislation but many institutional structures at the central, provincial, and district levels are to be \nreconfigured  in  a  further  phase  of  structural  change  itemized  in  the  Government's  strategic \nframework  for  decentralization  and  deconcentration.51  Importantly,  the  Government  is  drafting \nan  Organic  Law  on  Deconcentration  to  introduce  decentralized  governance  structures  at \nprovincial  and  district  levels  (dovetailing  with  those  created  at  commune  level),  streamline \nrelations  between  government  agencies  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels  (now  clouded  by \noverlapping  responsibilities  and  a  mix  of  centralized,  decentralized,  and  deconcentrated \nfeatures), and devolve own-resource financing to sub-national levels. By February 2007, when \nthe next commune elections take place, a successor to the Seila task force secretariat will be \noperational. Meanwhile, the existing institutions will continue to function, perhaps with different \ntitles, and their roles will eventually be integrated into new structures developed according to the \nstrategic  framework.52  The  Project  will  therefore  work  through  the  existing  institutional \narrangements  but  with  such  management  and  organizational  flexibility  that  its  structures  and \nprocesses  can  evolve  and  blend  with  those  of  the  anticipated  new  administrative  structures.53 \nAs  an  important  move  toward  implementing  the  recommendations  in  the  strategic  framework, \nthe  Project  will  set  up  commune  bank  accounts  as  the  vehicle  for  moving  funds  to  the \ncommunes. The provincial local administration units in MOI's department of local administration \nwill oversee the CLFTs. \n \n43. \nThe  TSBR  secretariat,  in  close  consultation  with  DOF,  IFREDI,  and  MOE,  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency  to  accomplish  output  2.  The  long-awaited  sub-decree  on  community \nfisheries  management  was  approved  on  20  May  2005,  and  the  draft  Fisheries  Law  is  also \nexpected  to  be  ratified  by  the  national  assembly  before  December  2005.  The  Government \nintends to reinforce its commitment to the edicts of biosphere reserve zoning. Critical to this is \nstopping the operations of fishing lots in the core areas once a management system compatible \nwith biodiversity conservation has been instituted. \n \n44. \nThe activities for output 3 have been composed to promote the rapid accomplishment of \noutput  1.  CARD  will  equip  itself  to  improve  coordination  for  community-driven  development. \nGiven  its  important  and  increasing  role  in  the  implementation  of  local  development  planning \nthrough decentralized and deconcentrated agencies, MOI will also act as Implementing Agency \nin enhancing the skills base for community-driven development. MOE will act as Implementing \nAgency in educating for the protection of natural resources. \n \nThe CLFTs will oversee the implementation of livelihood support at commune and village \n45. \nlevels. Each CLFT will be headed by the chief of the provincial local administration unit and will \nhave a permanent administration and a representative from each of the provincial departments \nof rural development, environment, and women's affairs, and the provincial office of fisheries. It \nwill  also  include  commune  facilitators,54  posted  in  each  commune,55  to  assist  communities  in \n(i) identifying  activities suitable  for funding  under  the  CLF,56  and  (ii)  preparing  the  activities for \n                                                 \n51  The strategic framework was expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers in August 2005. \n52  The  new  decentralization  and  deconcentration  systems  and  processes  will  be  introduced  in  two  phases:  a \n\ntransitional phase of 2 years (2006\u20132007) and a consolidation phase of 3 years (2008\u20132010). \n\n53 Retaining CLFT staff in the new structures would further guarantee sustainability. \n54  Commune facilitators  were created under the Seila program (some 800 have been appointed in 24 provinces) to \n\nassist commune councils in planning and to monitor the implementation of works. \n\n55  An additional 74 commune facilitators (48 for Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, and Pursat; and 26 for Siem Reap \n\nand Kompong Thom) will be selected and appointed. Each commune will be represented by two facilitators. \n\n56 The CLFTs will take the opportunity to promulgate the technical packages based on sustainable natural resource \n\nmanagement that are being designed under component 2 of the TSEMP. \n\n\f13 \n\nsubmission  to  the  CPBC.57  Additionally,  the  Project  will  attach  to  each  CLFT  domestic \nconsultants responsible for guiding, training,58 fielding, and supporting the line agency staff and \ncommune facilitators in the performance of their duties. An international consultant to be based \nin  each  of  the  CLFTs  in  Pursat  and  Siem  Reap  will  manage  and  coordinate  CLF \nimplementation.59 The CLFTs will approve the activities, monitor procurement by the commune \ncouncils, and report on CLF-related activities to MOI through the provincial local administration \nunits. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n46. \nThe Project will span 4 years (Appendix 7). All project activities are expected to be fully \ncompleted within this time. But much will depend on a speedy start-up to output 1. During the \nfirst  6  months  there  will  be  an  intensive  effort  to  build  skills  and  awareness  for  sustainable \nlivelihoods.  In  each  commune,  information  dissemination  workshops  will  be  held  and \nawareness-raising materials (e.g., pamphlets, posters, and samples of activity proposals) in the \nKhmer  language  will  be  distributed  to  villages  through  their  CPBC  representatives.  Commune \nfacilitators60 will be recruited, and a first round of priority activities61 for funding under the CLF \nwill be identified in consultation with the CPBCs. Activities will be screened by the consultants to \neliminate  any  that  are  unsuitable,  and  a  combined  list  will  be  submitted  to  the  commune \ncouncils  for  approval.  Detailed  designs,  cost  estimates,  business  plans,  and  implementation \ntheir \narrangements  will  be  prepared \nimplementation  will  be  prepared  and  awarded.62  The  consultants  will  use  this  first  cycle  to \nprovide  direct,  hands-on  training  to  the  commune  facilitators  and  other  agents  (e.g.,  village \nrepresentatives, administrative staff of commune councils, and CPBC  members) in identifying, \nscreening,  designing,  and  implementing  activities  under  the  CLF.  Adherence  to  this  plan  of \naction should ensure that later activities for output 1 proceed smoothly. The accomplishment of \noutputs 2 and 3 is not expected to present difficulties. \n \n\nfor  approved  activities,  and \n\nthen  contracts \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n47. \nCivil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  for  output  1,  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nschools,  and  small  village  works,  that  cost  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Their small and scattered nature is not likely \nto  attract  international  bidders.  Vehicles,  machinery,  and  office  equipment  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  shopping  if  the  cost  per  package  is  from  $100,000  to  $500,000,  and \nthrough local competitive bidding if the cost is less than $100,000. Goods with a value of less \nthan  $50,000  can  be  purchased  directly.  Service  contracts  may  be  given  to  NGOs.  The \ncommune councils, through the bidding committee, will procure civil works, goods, and related \nservices for eligible activities. Details of procurement packages will be determined during project \nimplementation. The training packages under output 3 will be procured by MOI. \n \n                                                 \n57  The  commune  facilitators  will  have  extensive  experience  in  facilitation,  including  presenting,  synthesizing,  and \n\nresponding to organizational issues raised. \n\n58  Training will focus on awareness raising, group formation, planning, coordination, quality assurance, and reporting. \n59  Pursat has 13, Siem Reap 10, Battambang 8, Kompong Chhnang 3, and Kompong Thom 3 target communes. \n60  The long list of candidates  will be drawn up by the commune councils based on criteria agreed  with CPBCs and \n\nline agency staff assigned to the CLFTs. \n\n61 Most of the activities are expected to be drawn from existing commune development plans\u2014those that  were not \n\nfunded in the current development budget or multi-year plans. \n\n62  The Project will aim to complete these operations in time for the communes to receive the CLF funds together with \n\nthe development funds, which are released each February by the national treasury. \n\n\f14 \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n48. \nThe Project will require 841 person-months of consulting services\u2014708 person-months \nby domestic consultants and 133 person-months by international consultants (Appendix 8). The \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  according  to  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of \ndomestic  consultants.  In  view  of  its  experience,  capacity,  and  commitment,  the  WorldFish \nCenter  of  the  Consultative  Group  on  International  Agricultural  Research  will  be  appointed  by \ndirect  selection  for  output  2.63  Live  and  Learn  Environmental  Education64  will  be  appointed  by \ndirect selection for the activities in output 3 that relate to education for the protection of natural \nresources.  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  in  recruiting  all  other \nconsultants.  Two  international  consultants  and  20  domestic  consultants  will  be  based  in  the \nproject  provinces.  A  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  attached  to  MOI's \ndepartment of local administration65 in Phnom Penh. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n49. \nThe  Government  will  open  a  first-generation  imprest  account  at  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia into which grant funds from ADB will be deposited. The amount to be deposited into \nthe  first-generation  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $1  million.  A  second-\ngeneration  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  the  name  of  MOI  in  a  commercial  bank, \nacceptable to the Government and ADB, for the purpose of replenishing and liquidating the CLF \nand for other activities under the Project. The ceiling of the second-generation imprest account \nwill not exceed $500,000. ADB's statement-of-expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse \neligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest  accounts.  The  ceiling  on  the \nstatement  of  expenditure  is  $100,000  per  payment.  The  first-  and  second-generation  imprest \naccounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  of  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed \narrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  CLF  grant  funds  will  be \ntransferred  from  the  second-generation  imprest  account  to  the  account  of  each  of  the  37 \ncommune councils at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and MOI (Appendix 9). \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50.  MEF, MOE, MOI, the TSBR secretariat, and the CLFTs will maintain separate accounts \nstrictly for the Project. The CLFTs will maintain ongoing and up-to-date accounts for the Project \naccording  to  sound  and  acceptable  accounting  principles  and  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to \nMOI  through  the  provincial  local  administration  units.  The  CLFTs  will  use  the  financial \nmanagement  procedures  in  the  Financial  Management  Manual  and  its  supplement.66  MOI  will \nprepare an annual financial report on the Project's accounts and submit it to MEF and ADB. The \nimprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  of \n\n                                                 \n63 The  WorldFish  Center  works  on  inland  and  marine  fisheries  in  developing  countries.  It  has  existing  collaboration \narrangements  with  DOF  on  issues  dealing  with  institutional  frameworks,  livelihood  analysis,  and  economic \nvaluation. It has just opened a regional center in Phnom Penh. \n\n64  Live  and  Learn  Environmental  Education  is  a  regional  nongovernment  organization  specializing  in  environmental \neducation.  It  works  with  poverty-stricken  communities  to  develop  community-based  problem-solving  models  and \nwith government to integrate these models into national curricula and education strategies. It has been tasked with \ndelivering the national environmental education and awareness campaign under component 1 of the TSEMP. \n\n65  A project manager no lower in rank than a director will serve full time throughout the Project. \n66  ADB  and  World  Bank.  2005.  Financial  Management  Manual  for  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank.  Manila.  Also  relevant  here  is  the  Manual  on  Operating  Procedures  for  Externally  Assisted  Projects \nUnder the Purview of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (undated). Manila. \n\n\f15 \n\nthe Project's accounts and financial statements, and audit opinions on the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures will be set out separately according to ADB procedures. The Project's \naccounts  will  be  audited  each  year  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \naudited accounts, together with the auditor's report, will be submitted to ADB not more than 6 \nmonths  after  each  financial  year.  MOI's  decision  in  June  2005  to  establish  provincial  and \nmunicipal  C/SF  accountability  working  groups  is  also  expected  to  promote  the  transparent, \naccountable, and effective use and implementation of the CLF. The annual audit report should \nspecify the auditor's opinion on the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n51. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52. \nProject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  based  on  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  and  the  baseline  surveys  specified  in  it,  as  set  out  in  Appendix  3. \nMonitoring will also be undertaken by the Executing Agency as part of the standard procedures \nrequired by ADB through the disbursement of funds and the semiannual and annual reporting. \nThe  Implementing  Agencies  will  be  responsible  for  providing  the  Executing  Agency  with \nquarterly progress reports on their respective outputs. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB will conduct semiannual reviews facilitated by CARD. The reviews will (i) examine \n53. \nthe appropriateness of implementation arrangements and schedules of activities, (ii) assess the \nprocedures  for  village  and  commune  development  plans,  (iii)  review  compliance  with  agreed \nprocurement  procedures,  (iv)  analyze  the  outcomes  of  the  capacity-building  and  training \nprograms,  and  (v)  monitor,  in  consultation  with  the  TSBR  secretariat,  the  effectiveness  of \nsafeguard  procedures.  At  mid-term,  a  comprehensive  project  review  will  be  jointly  undertaken \nby ADB and the Government. Within 3 months of project completion, MOI will submit to ADB a \nproject completion report in the standard ADB format. \n \n\n10. \n\nGender Action Plan \n\n54. \nThe analyses conducted during project preparation confirmed gender inequality and the \nparticular  vulnerability  of  women,  especially  those  who  head  households.67  Women  have  few \nopportunities  to  take  action  because  of  traditional  gender  roles  in  Khmer  society.68  Thus,  they \n                                                 \n67  Women-headed households constitute about 25% of all households in the project area. \n68  Issues  raised  by  women  included  (i)  high  levels  of  indebtedness,  (ii)  lack  of  technical  know-how  for  livestock \nraising,  (iii)  the  passive  roles  expected  of  them  in  community  decision-making  meetings,  (iv)  lack  of  educational \nopportunities for the children of poor households, (v) heavy  workloads for women heads of households, (vi) child \nlabor  especially  among  children  of  poor  households,  (vii)  lack  of  maternal  and  child  health  facilities,  (viii)  lack  of \n\n\fare poorly represented in community decision-making bodies, have low social status, and lack \nequal  access  to  and  control  over  livelihood  assets\u2014all  the  factors  that  define  livelihood \noutcomes.  The  Project  will  seek  to  counter  these  constraints  by  promoting  community-driven \ndevelopment. A gender action plan lays out the strategy that will achieve this, which is one of \nsupporting women's claim to effective participation (Appendix 10). \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n(ii) \n\nEnvironmental. The Project will generate substantial environmental benefits. \n(i) \n\nSustainable  livelihoods.  Investing  in  livelihoods  will  mitigate  threats  to  the \nTonle Sap. Inadequate access to assets and associated activities for short-term \ngain degrade the ecosystem. \nCore  areas.  Safeguarding  the  core  areas  will  conserve  the  globally  significant, \nhigh  concentrations  of  biodiversity  within  species,  between  species,  and  of \necosystems.  It  will  also  contribute  to  maintaining  fish  populations  and  the \nproductive fisheries of the Tonle Sap. \nEnvironmental education and awareness. Better awareness of the value of the \nenvironment and how certain activities undermine it will foster behavioral change. \n\n(iii) \n\nInstitutional. The Project will boost decentralization and deconcentration. \n(i) \n\nIncentives. The Project will provide institutional incentives to address policy and \ninstitutional  failures  that  constrain  livelihood  outcomes.  These  incentives  derive \nfrom  the  changing  of  fishing  rights,  the  empowerment  of  local  social  capital \nthrough  decentralized  planning,  and  horizontal  coordination.  Natural  resource \nmanagement  will  become  more  efficient  as  transaction  and  management  costs \nare  lowered  and  more  decisions  are  made  at  the  local  level.  The  benefits  from \ninstitutionalizing these changes will be reflected in greater stakeholder access to \nresources,  services,  and  information  through  which  communities  can  retain  a \ngreater share of market value. The institutionalization of these incentives, along \nwith new mechanisms for horizontal and vertical interaction, will contribute to the \nthat  support \nemergence  of  policy, \nconservation  and  improved  livelihood  outcomes.  The  incentives  and  increased \nempowerment  of  stakeholders  in  the  longer  term  will  increasingly  define  a \nmanagement system compatible with biodiversity conservation. \nSelf-reliance.  Focusing  on  communes  and  devolving  decision  making  and \nfinancial  control  to  that  level  will  encourage  self-reliance.  Benefits  will  include \nenhanced  capacity,  at  village  and  commune  level,  to  prepare,  manage,  and \nimplement development plans, as well as monitor and evaluate results. Training \nin the establishment, orientation, and operation of activity groups will support this. \nService  delivery.  Decentralizing  and  deconcentrating  will  lead  to  more  specific \nrequests  for  service  delivery.  Building  capacity  at  the  provincial  level  will  assist \nline agencies in meeting such demands. \n\nlegal,  and  organizational  structures \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n16 \n\n55. \n\n \n56. \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \npotable  water,  (ix)  poor  sanitation,  (x)  domestic  violence,  and  (xi)  limited  opportunities  for  improved  livelihoods. \nKhmer tradition does not favor women speaking out in public. As a result, women tend to agree with proposals put \nacross by male-dominated commune councils and male commune chiefs. \n\n\f17 \n\n57. \n\nHuman and Social. The Project will raise human and social capital. \n(i) \n\nCollective  action.  Increasing  the  stock  of  active  connections  among  people\u2014\ntrust,  mutual  understanding,  and  shared  values  and  behaviors\u2014will  bind \ncommunities  and  make  cooperative  action  possible.  Cambodians  hold  social \ncapital in high regard, irrespective of income level, gender, or ethnicity. \nGender.  Helping  women  to  organize  and  develop  their  capacity  for  informed \nrepresentation and participation in an expanded community-based planning and \ndecision-making framework will give them fairer access to assets. \nSocial infrastructure. Investing in basic infrastructure such as water supply and \nsanitation,  waste  management  facilities,  clinics,  and  schools  will  improve  the \nhealth and well-being of all members of a community. Lack of basic infrastructure \nis considered a core dimension of poverty. \nEthnic  minorities.  The  Project  will  give  ethnic  minorities  equal  opportunities  to \nparticipate.  Built-in  design  features  exist  to  meet  their  needs  and  demonstrable \nbenefit to ethnic minorities is a criterion for activities eligible for funding under the \nCLF (Appendix 11). \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n58. \nEconomic  and  Financial.  The  project  benefits  are  (i)  improved  rural  livelihoods  that \ncontribute  to  sustainable  management  of  the  Tonle  Sap,  and  (ii)  better  governance  and \nprovision of incentives that encourage institutional innovation. The funding of priority commune \ndevelopment  plans  leaves  investment  decisions  with  the  mandated  commune  councils  and  as \nsuch  the  investment  is  programmatic.  The  analysis  of  economic  benefits  uses  an  assumed \ninvestment package based on indicative models derived from analyses conducted during project \npreparation.69 Actual packages will vary with emphasis on those that \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nenhance  local  access  to  assets  through  income-generating  activities  and \nincreased value addition and capture; \nreduce  vulnerability  and  risks  by  providing  social  infrastructure  such  as  water \nsupply and sanitation, waste management facilities, clinics, and schools; and \nexpand  opportunities  for  livelihood  improvement  through  better  access  to \nmarkets, services, technology, and information. \n\n \n59. \n\nTwo infrastructure models were used for the economic assessment: \n(i) \n\nIntroducing small-scale domestic water supply by providing wells and pumps for \ngroups  of  households  (30  households  representing  165  individuals).  The \ninvestment  will  reduce  water  collection  time  (by  66%),  and  the  incidence  of \nillnesses  (by  30%),  and  the  number  of  productive  days  lost.  The  expected \nbenefits  from  reducing  health  expenditure  (now  11%  of  household  expenditure) \nand  social  distress  (45%  of  households  now  have  to  borrow  for  health-care \ntreatment) have not been quantified. \nProviding  fish  marketing  infrastructure  for  each  group  of  20  households.  This  is \npredicted to reduce post-harvest losses, which now amount to 2% of total sales, \nand increase value by 3% by better preserving fish for market. \n\n(ii) \n\nFour  income-generating  activity  models  were  used  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  income- \n\n \n60. \ngenerating activities: \n\n                                                 \n69  These  analyses  developed  a  wide  range  of  models  that  were  simplified  during  grant  fact-finding  to  reflect  the \nprogrammatic  nature  of  the  funding  arrangement.  The  actual  investments  will  vary  significantly  by  locale.  The \npurpose  of  the  assessment  is  to  indicate  the  feasibility  of  the  overall  investment:  it  does  not  seek  to  validate \nindividual pre-specified investments. \n\n\f18 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nFattening pigs on boats or floating platforms. This model assumes production to \nbe  fully  incremental.  It  involves  the  yearly  purchase  of  three  piglets,  that  are \nfattened over 9 months to a final weight of 70 kilograms. The model assumes a \n10% death rate and use of unimproved local breeds.70 \nIntroducing micro irrigation schemes to garden and cropping areas. The irrigation \nsystems will replace hand watering, saving an assumed labor input of 10% and \nresulting in a 30% yield increase. Cropping intensity does not increase and other \ninputs remain the same as the model assumes that agrochemicals and fertilizers \nare not included in the model as they are not eligible for investment funds. \nIntroducing improved fish smoking technology using a low technology upgrade of \nexisting  systems.  The  model  involves  limited  investment  and  is  based  at  the \nhousehold level. The benefits are based on a 20% saving in labor input, reduced \nfuel wood demand of 23%, and a 5% increase in value addition. \nProviding  improved  fish  drying  technology  to  add  value  to  excess  and  lower \nquality catch. Groups of 10 households will introduce improved drying racks that \nwill reduce fish drying losses by 2%, add value by 5%, and through the process \nof  group  formation  bulk-purchase  salt  for  a  10%  discount.  A  10%  increase  in \nlabor input is assumed necessary for the handling of bulk salt, additional fish, etc. \n\n \n61. \nThe  financial  feasibility  of  the  models,  and  hence  their  contribution  to  household  cash \nflow as a measure of the likelihood of the households' participation, was assessed. The financial \nassessment,  on  a  \"with  project\"  and  \"without  project\"  basis,  indicates  significant  financial \nbenefits ranging from KR2,400 to more than KR6,000 per day, compared with an imputed daily \nwage rate of KR3,600. Given the high levels of underemployment in the country, these returns \nare  expected  to  attract  the  participation  of  the  target  beneficiaries.  In  all,  about  250,000 \nbeneficiaries will be directly involved in the Project. Of these, 100,000 will benefit from income-\ngenerating  activities,  and  150,000\u2014possibly  more  if  public  goods  such  as  school  classrooms \nare provided\u2014will benefit directly from social infrastructure. \n \n62. \nThe annual incremental output of the indicative models amounts to (i) 500 tons of live-\nweight pigs from 2,448 enterprises, (ii) 350 tons of irrigated garden crops from 2,448 gardens, \n(iii)  70,000  tons  of  fish  with  an  increased  value  of  about  7%  from  fish  smoking  and  drying, \n(iv) about  5,000  tons  less  in  post-harvest  losses  because  of  improved  drying  and  market \ninfrastructure, (v) 4,723 water supply systems, and (vi) 610 community-based markets. \n \n63. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the individual models range from 42% to \nmore than 200%.71 The overall EIRR is 24% for the base case, representing a return well above \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (12%).  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  Project  is  robust:  large \nchanges are required to reach the switching points. Details are in Table 3. \n \n\n                                                 \n70 The  Project  will  make  use  of  information  from  ADB.  2005.

Manila. (JFPR 9064\u2013CAM). \n\n71  Although  high,  these  EIRRs  reflect  the  small-scale  nature  of  the  investments.  They  are  also  consistent  with  the \n\nWorld Bank's assessment of small-scale rural infrastructure under the Seila program. \n\n\fTable 3: Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Tests \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDescription \n\n - Project costs up 20% \n - Net benefit streams down 20% \n - Net benefit streams down 50% \n\nBase case \nSensitivity tests \n \n \n \nSwitching values @ 12% (opportunity cost of capital) \n \n \n\n - Net benefit streams down  \n - Project costs up  \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n19 \n\nEIRR \n\n24% \n \n21% \n20% \n15% \n \n59% \n146% \n\n64. \nEnvironmental  Impact.  The  initial  environmental  examination  finalized  during  grant \nfact-finding  concluded  that  the  Project  would  have  no  negative  impacts  on  the  environment. \nQuite the reverse, it will contribute significantly to sound management of natural resources and \nthe environment. Still, because it will precipitate the removal of fishing lots from the core areas, \nIt will be vital to have a management system in place when this happens to prevent uncontrolled \nexploitation. The service provider that will design it will be fielded well in advance. \n \n65. \nCorruption.  The  Seila  program  has  experienced  abuses  and  corruption  and  it  is \nnecessary  to  build  confidence  in  the  integrity  of  financial  management.  The  fund  flow \nmechanism and procedures for the CLF, as well as the guidance that the Project provides for \nimplementing small projects with community participation, will minimize the possibility of monies \nbeing misappropriated.72 \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOI  have  given  the \n\n66. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  It  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  request \nand  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  during  each  year  of \nproject implementation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  smooth  flow  of  funds  from  central  level  to  the \nproject provinces and the commune level. \nThe  Government  and  MOI  will  ensure  that  the  CLFTs  are  established  in  the \nproject provinces to oversee the implementation of the activities funded under the \nCLF.  The  Government  and  MOI  will  also  ensure  that  the  CLF  is  established \nwithin 3 months following the grant effective date. The CLF will only be used to \nfinance  small-scale  community-driven  activities  that  are  planned  and  agreed  at \nvillage  and  commune  levels  relating  to  (a)  social  infrastructure,  (b)  income \ngeneration,  and  (c)  community  fisheries  in  accordance  with  Appendix  4  of  this \nreport.  \n\n                                                 \n72  The  guidance  proffered  includes  (i)  a  sample  questionnaire  for  community  participation  in  the  construction  of \nschool  buildings,  (ii)  a  draft  agreement  for  community  participation  in  the  construction  of  school  buildings,  (iii)  a \ndraft contract for civil works, and (iv) sample selection criteria for NGOs. \n\n\f20 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nTo  ensure  the  smooth  transfer  of  the  CLF  grant  funds  to  each  of  the  37 \ncommunes,  immediately  upon  the  establishment  of  the  CLF,  each  of  the \ncommune  councils  will  establish  a  bank  account  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to ADB. \nThe Government and MOI will ensure that only investment packages meeting the \neligibility  criteria  for  CLF  activities  set  out  in  Table  A4.1  of  Appendix  4  of  this \nreport receive funding under the CLF. \nThe Government and MOI will ensure that each of the communes implementing \nactivities funded under the CLF is responsible for adhering to the Government's \nenvironmental laws and regulations, and ADB's Environment Policy (2002), and \nmaking  certain  that  best  environmental  practices  are  incorporated  into  all \nactivities and their implementation. Further, the Government will ensure that each \nof  the  communes  meets  the  environmental  assessment  review  procedures \ndescribed in the initial environmental examination. \nThe  Government  and  MOI  will  ensure  and  will  cause  the  communes  to  ensure \nthat,  prior  to  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts,  it  will  screen  for  involuntary \nresettlement  effects  to  make  certain  that  there  are  no  losses  of  land,  income, \nhousing, community facilities, and resources that would require compensation to \nbe paid in accordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). In \nthe  event  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  required  for  any  activities  or \nprojects  funded  under  the  CLF,  such  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with the land acquisition and resettlement framework. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  MOI  will  ensure  that  the  village  or  commune  special \ninterest groups established under the Project in each of the project provinces will \ninclude  women's  groups  and  ethnic  minorities.  There  will  be  no  ethnic \ndiscrimination and equal opportunities will be provided to all minorities. \nThe Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with \nADB's Policy on Gender and Development (2003) and the agreed gender action \nplan as set out in Appendix 10 of this report. \n\n(ix) \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\n67. \nPrior  to  grant  effectiveness,  a  project  steering  committee  headed  by  the  secretary \ngeneral  of  CARD  will  have  been  established  and  all  necessary  staff  with  qualifications \nacceptable to ADB will have been appointed. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n68. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove: \n(i) \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $15,000,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia, from ADB's Special Funds resources, for the Tonle Sap Sustainable \nLivelihoods  Project,  on  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  financing  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$ 4,738,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of \nFinland on a grant basis. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n23 November 2005 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJoseph B. Eichenberger \nVice President Operations 2 \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nThe Tonle Sap in Transition \n\nThe Sustainable Livelihoods Framework \n\n \nA. \n \nPopulation and development pressures are taking their toll and the Tonle Sap is in crisis. \n1. \nSo  too  are  those  who  live  from  it.  Threats  include  overexploitation  of  fisheries  and  wildlife \nresources,  encroachment  during  the  dry  season,  and  cutting  of  the  flooded  forest,  leading  to \nsevere  and  rising  levels  of  poverty  and  a  pending  environmental  disaster.  In  the  lakeside \nprovinces of Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap about \n38% of the population falls under the official poverty line, the highest proportion in the country. \nOminously,  50%  of  villages  have  40\u201360%  of  households  living  below  the  poverty  line,  with  a \npeak of 80% in parts of Siem Reap and Kompong Chhnang. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nA  livelihood  comprises  the  capabilities,  assets,  and  activities  required  for  a  means  of \nliving. A livelihood is deemed sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and \nshocks  and  maintain  or  enhance  its  capabilities,  assets,  and  activities  both  now  and  in  the \nfuture, while not undermining the natural resource base. Sustainable livelihood approaches are \nbased on evolving thinking about poverty reduction, the way the poor and vulnerable live their \nlives,  and  the  importance  of  structural  and  institutional  issues.  They  suggest  development \nactivities  that  are  people-centered,  responsive  and  participatory,  multilevel,  conducted  in \npartnership with both the public and private sectors, dynamic, and sustainable. \n \nSustainable  livelihood  approaches  facilitate  the  identification  of  practical  priorities  for \n3. \nactions  that  are  based  on  the  views  and  interests  of  those  concerned,  but  they  are  not  a \npanacea. They do not replace other tools such as sector-wide approaches and integrated rural \ndevelopment.  However,  they  make  the  connection  between  people  and  the  overall  enabling \nenvironment that influences the outcomes of livelihood strategies. They bring attention to bear \non  the  inherent  potential  of  people  in  terms  of  their  skills,  social  networks,  access  to  physical \nand financial resources, and ability to influence core institutions. \n \nFrom  April  to  July  2004,  a  project  preparatory  survey  was  conducted  in  32  communes \n4. \nwithin  11  districts  of  the  five  provinces  that  adjoin  the  Tonle  Sap.  More  than  673  people \n(including  318  women,  25  ethnic  Vietnamese,  and  48  ethnic  Cham)  participated.  New  and \ndifferent images of each community were revealed. Entry points for sustainable livelihoods were \ndeveloped.  The  survey  was  termed  purposive  participatory  rural  appraisal  because  of  the \nemphasis placed on strengths rather than on weaknesses, and the desire to look to the future in \nterms of those strengths. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nHuman Capital. Why couldn't they\u2014whose ancestors built the temples of Angkor\u2014now \nmake  their  communities  better  places  in  which  to  live?  Survey  participants  asked  this  of \nthemselves.  They  once  caught  plentiful  fish,  gathered  as  many  non-timber  forest  products  as \nthey  needed  and,  in  most  years,  grew  enough  rice  to  feed  all  households.  Food  security  was \nnever an issue. The feeling that the world had become too complex for them to understand was \nchallenged  by  their  recognition  that  the  lives  of  their  ancestors  were  also  not  without  great \nchallenges. \n \n\nLivelihood Assets \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nirrigation  canals, \n\nThankfully,  there  is  still  considerable  human  capital  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region. \n6. \nCommunities still have enviable skills, knowledge, and ability. But they now find that these do \nnot equip them sufficiently to meet rapidly changing needs. Access to radio and television is a \ndaily reminder that they must have more advanced education and training. Survey participants \nrecognized  that  their  human  capital  deficits  relate  to  how  to:  add  value  to  fishery  products; \nconduct small-scale livestock raising and fish-cage culture, access potable water, and reconcile \nimmediate consumption with sustainable use of natural resources. \n \nSocial  Capital.  Cambodians  hold  social  capital  in  high  regard,  irrespective  of  income \n7. \nlevel,  gender,  or  ethnicity.  All  prefer  to  rely  on  their  community  than  to  seek  assistance \nelsewhere. And, notwithstanding distress sales of livelihood assets, no one wants to see fellow \nvillagers suffer unduly. \n \n8. \nNetworks and connectedness, membership in more formalized groups, and relationships \nof  trust,  reciprocity,  and  exchanges  determine  how  people  can  work  together  in  pursuit  of \nlivelihood outcomes. Communities know of prohibitions against the use of illegal fishing gears. \nThey  look  for  the  structures  and  processes  that  would  enable  them  to  abide  by  or  enforce \nregulations. \n \n9. \nVertical  patronage  networks  exist. They  include  food-for-work  programs  to  construct  or \nintravillage  roads,  school  buildings,  and  health  centers. \nrehabilitate \nIncreasingly, such networks involve political support to patrons who are elected to the national \nassembly. These patron-client relationships often appear to be a more dominant force than the \nrule  of  law.  Patronage  is  also  provided  to  individual  households  in  the  form  of  emergency \nassistance after house fires or crop failures. \n \n10. \nHouseholds routinely participate in reciprocal labor exchange to transplant and harvest \npaddy, women band together to collect non-timber forest products from the flooded forest, and \nentire villages move to catch fish during the dry season. New horizontal networks in the form of \nvillage  development  committees  have  also  emerged.  In  some  communities  they  have  created \nan  enabling  environment  for  women  to  be  heard.  In  others,  they  operate  at  non-village  level \nthrough their commune council to generate or ratify development activities. \n \n11.  Why  then  do  the  poor  and  vulnerable  end  up  on  the  streets  of  Phnom  Penh?  Initially, \nsurvey participants affirmed that they had little social capital at their disposal. Yet, as the survey \nprogressed,  they  began  to  discuss  possibilities  for  establishing  small-scale  savings  and  credit \ngroups. They recognized that establishing such groups was not so different from the vertical and \nhorizontal networks that provide safety nets. \n \n12. \nThe communities of the Tonle Sap region have far to go before they can enjoy the kinds \nof  livelihood  outcomes  that  they  had  in  the  past.  They  welcome  lessons  from  elsewhere  but \nexpect  outside  experts  to  demonstrate  intimate  knowledge  of  social  networks  in  Cambodia \nbefore they make recommendations. Those who disparage this point deepen dependency. \n \nNatural Capital. Apart from the abundance of fish in the Tonle Sap\u2014which makes it the \n13. \nmost productive freshwater-capture fisheries in the world\u2014the flooded areas are rich in natural \nassets that, if properly managed, can provide sustainable livelihoods for all. The flooded forest \ncan  supply  building  materials  and  fuel  wood,  as  well  as  a  wide  range  of  non-timber  forest \nproducts,  to  which  value  can  be  added.  The  flooded  areas  and  the  receding  floods  provide \nfertile  paddy  fields  within  which  there  is  also  a  rich  harvest  of  fish,  crabs,  frogs,  snails,  ants, \nherbs, and plants to supplement the diet. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\n \n14. \nBut  evidence  points  to  a  grim  future.  Average  fish  catches  are  smaller,  the  share  of \nlarger species in the total catch volume is in sharp decline, and the catch of medium-sized fish \nis showing a decrease. In 2004, the fish catch dropped to 250,000 tons from vertiginous peaks \nof  300,000\u2013400,000  tons  in  recent  years.  And  the  flooded  forest,  which  stimulates  fish \nreproduction,  shows  unabated  and  dramatic  decline.  It  originally  extended  over  1  million \nhectares. By the 1960s, this area had been cut to about 614,000 hectares. In 1991, the flooded \nforest  was  estimated  at  362,000  hectares.  Land  use  data  now  suggest  that  only  20,000 \nhectares remain. \n \n15. \nCommercial  fishing  lots  claim  significant  areas  of  the  lake.  Although  these  are  now \nsubject  to  reforms,  there  is  dismay  at  how  long  these  have  been  going  on  or  indeed  whether \nchange will occur at all. Survey participants, except those involved in fishing lots operations or \nseasonal construction, declared that abolishing the lots would improve their livelihoods. \n \n16. \nCommunities  should  be  supported  in  their  claim  to  greater  ownership  of  natural \nresources  that  are  critical  to  livelihoods.  Attempts  to  help  establish  community  fisheries  and \ncommunity  forestry  organizations  are  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  but  these  alone  are  not \nsufficient. Such organizations are now under-resourced\u2014often lacking basic equipment such as \nboats and motorcycles\u2014and not all community members have been encouraged to participate \nactively.  There  is  also  a  need  for  practical  community-based  management  guidelines  and  for \nsupportive legislation. \n \n17. \nIn  the  first  stages  of  the  survey,  especially  at  predominantly  Khmer  locations, \nparticipants  blamed  everyone  but  fellow  villagers  for  the  decline  in  fisheries.  The  ethnic \nVietnamese  were  often  the  focus  of  this  blame  (although  not  in  non-fishing  villages),  as  were \nlarger-scale, non-community-based fishers and executive agency officials. Yet there was some \nconcession that not all ethnic Vietnamese\u2014especially long-term residents\u2014seek to overexploit \nfishing resources. At the end of the survey, Khmer fishers admitted that members of their own \ncommunities  do  use  illegal  fishing  gears  or  engage  in  destructive  fishing  practices  using \nexplosives, poisons, and electro-fishing. They claimed that they had no choice. \n \nSurvey  participants  from  non-fishing  villages,  especially  land-poor  or  landless  people, \n18. \nlooked to the flooded forest as a natural resource that can be converted into agricultural land. \nThey found it difficult to appreciate the resource flows and services that it provides, not least of \nall  to  fishers.  But  in  dialogue  with  the  latter,  they  showed  willingness  to  examine  ways  to \nconserve the flooded forest provided their changing livelihood needs can be met. Indisputably, \nthe key to sustainable livelihoods is to maintain the balance between fisheries and agricultural \ninterests while keeping the system ecologically intact. \n \nPhysical  Capital.  Without  adequate  access  to  services  such  as  water  and  energy, \n19. \nhuman  health  deteriorates  and  long  periods  are  spent  in  nonproductive  activities  such  as  the \ncollection of water and fuel wood. Without transport infrastructure, essential fertilizer cannot be \ndistributed  effectively,  agricultural  yields  remain  low,  and  it  is  difficult  and  expensive  to  move \nlimited produce to the market. \n \n20. \nLack of clean domestic water is a problem. More than 80% of households in the Tonle \nSap region rely on shallow dug wells or surface water sources and many travel long distances \nto the closest source of supply, especially in the dry season. Since all these sources tend to be \npolluted,  it  can  be  assumed  that  at  least  80%  of  households  do  not  have  access  to  safe \ndomestic water. Survey participants recognized that their physical capital deficits relate to fully \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nstaffed  and  equipped  health  centers;  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  bathrooms,  and  latrines; \nimproved roads; and new or rehabilitated irrigation systems. \n \n21. \nPhysical  capital  can  be  expensive.  At  the  outset  of  the  survey,  most  participants \nassumed that the Government would pay for infrastructure. This is what they had observed over \nthe past decade. However, at the end of the survey, they asked how communities could build \nphysical capital if all stood to benefit. They spoke of voluntary associations. They suggested that \nvillage  development  committees  or  similar  institutions  could  mobilize  in-kind  contributions, \nperhaps  with  external  assistance,  to  build  and  maintain  essential  infrastructure  such  as  intra-\nvillage roads and water supply systems. The willingness of survey participants to consider user \ninvolvement  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  holds  promise.  Demand-driven  approaches  can \nensure that there are incentives for maintenance because of high levels of user investment in \nthe form of labor and materials. \n \n22. \nFinancial Capital. Financial capital tends to be the least available livelihood asset of the \npoor. Indeed, it is because the poor lack financial capital that the other types of livelihood assets \nare so important to them. In Cambodia, savings often take the form of jewelry, which has stood \nthe test of time and remained convertible during crises. For most farmers, livestock is still a very \nimportant financial asset. Yet it is now increasingly necessary to also have access to cash. Until \nrecently, Cambodians preferred to deal in dollars or baht. But, as though to indicate confidence \nin  the  local  currency,  more  and  more  are  willing  to  trade  for  goods  and  services  in  riels, \nespecially to meet immediate livelihood needs. \n \n23.  What  can  be  done  to  build  financial  capital  for  the  poor?  Since  development  agencies \nare not in the business of handing out money to the poor and vulnerable, and demand outstrips \nsupply in any case, increasing access to financial services is of special importance, particularly \nin  the  area  of  microfinance.  In  Cambodia,  however,  people  prefer  to  avoid  microfinance \ninstitutions.  This  is  partly  because  they  are  risk-averse  and  partly  because  they  cannot  meet \ncollateral  requirements.  Unless  people  believe  that  microfinance  institutions  will  persist  over \ntime and will continue to charge reasonable rates of interest, they will not entrust their savings to \nthem or be reliable in making their loan repayments. \n \nThe  Association  of  Cambodian  Local  Economic  Development  Agencies,  which  also \n24. \noperates as a microfinance institution, is a case in point. It was constituted to help the poor and \nvulnerable but inability to comply with its terms and conditions can spell disaster, including loss \nof  livestock,  fishing  gear,  landholdings,  and  house.  The  survey  revealed  a  general  preference \nfor borrowing money from less formal sources, preferably kin and neighbors or even wealthier \nvillagers  and  traders,  whose  repayment  terms  are  considerably  more  flexible  than  those  of \nmicrofinance  institutions.  The  survey  also  revealed  that  the  ethnic  Vietnamese  are  less  risk-\naverse and that they prefer to use traders to meet urgent livelihood needs. \n \n25. \nA  few  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  also  provide microfinance.  By  preference, \nthey  target  the  very  poor  and  vulnerable.  In  fact,  however,  non-poor  households  often  benefit \nmost  from  such  programs.  But  this  is  more  likely  to  be  a  function  of  deficient  focus.  The  real \nproblem,  as  the  survey  participants  saw  it,  is  that  NGOs,  not  communities,  manage  the \nprograms. \n \n26. \nThe  size  of  the  loans  that  survey  participants  take  can  vary.  KR50,000  ($13)  meets \nimmediate  livelihood  needs  for  rice and  other  necessities. Only  the  very  poor  take  such  loans \nout  up  to  six  times  a  year.  At  the  other  extreme,  KR5,000,000  ($1,300)  allows  investments  in \nlivelihoods activities that will increase financial capital. Only better-off households take out such \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\nThe Vulnerability Context \n\nloans.  KR50,000  buys  up  to  50  kilograms  of  rice  while  KR5,000,000  buys  large  encircling \ngillnets  to  catch  higher-value  fish  in  the  Tonle  Sap  or  a  pair  of  draft  animals  and  farming \nimplements.  Plainly,  livelihood  outcomes  from  such  loans  are  quite  different  for  the  very  poor \nand  for  the  better-off.  Credit  schemes  can  materially  improve  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor, \nespecially  if  they  are  integrated  into  a  broader  financial  services  package,  e.g.,  as  key \ncomponents  of  a  broader  financial  services  infrastructure.  In  such  instances,  revolving  credit \nfunds providing seed capital to meet start-up costs for equipment and training bode well. Higher \nstill,  village  development  funds  can  build  physical  capital  in  the  form  of  school  buildings, \nintravillage roads, or adequate water supply and sanitation. \n \nD. \n \nThe  vulnerability  context  defines  the  external  environment  in  which  people  exist.  The \n27. \nconflict that raged from the early 1970s to 1993\u2014and continued northwest of the Tonle Sap until \n1998\u2014devastated  or  traumatized  entire  communities.  To  this  must  be  added  critical  trends, \ne.g.,  demographic,  environmental,  economic,  governance,  and  technological  trends;  shocks, \ne.g.,  illnesses,  floods,  storms,  and  droughts;  and  seasonalities,  e.g.,  prices,  and  employment \nopportunities. \n \n28. \nAt  present,  primary  sources  of  vulnerability  are  low  fish  catches,  fires  in  the  flooded \nforest (set to clear it for farming or charcoal), and flooding and drought (reportedly more difficult \nto  predict  than  in  the  past).  Another  major  source  of  vulnerability  is  illness,  which  can  strip \nhouseholds of  livelihood  assets.  The  main  coping  strategy  is  to  rely  on  close  kin, sympathetic \nneighbors, and wealthier villagers to avoid at all cost the loss of fishing boats, draft animals, and \nland. Natural shocks that affect food security are now a major problem for more than half of the \nhouseholds  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region.  For  the  land-poor,  rice  deficits  may  begin  in  August  and \nextend until April. This worsens their reliance on non-timber forest products. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nStructures are the public and private sector organizations that set and implement policy \nand legislation, deliver services, purchase, trade, and perform all manner of other functions that \naffect  livelihoods.  Since  1993,  the  Government  has  done  a  great  deal  to  define  the  basic \ngovernance  framework.  As  might  be  expected,  it  has  provided  a  range  of  services  to \ncommunities  such  as  schools,  health  centers,  all-weather  roads,  and  irrigation  systems. \nHowever, it has been less successful with non-physical assets, particularly natural and financial \ncapital. Much work remains to be done in building structures for the poor in that respect. \n \n30. \nAre  there  pro-poor  structures  in  Cambodia?  Most  executing  agencies  have  embraced \npoverty reduction as a crosscutting theme but how they reduce poverty is not always apparent. \nFor  the  survey  participants,  the  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries,  and  even  environmental \nexecuting agencies that have made their presence felt at the commune level are not pro-poor. \nThe participants argued that if the rhetoric of these agencies is pro-poor, the practices of many \nof their officials are not. They requested that these agencies demonstrate their commitment to \nimproving livelihoods and explain how their processes have been made pro-poor. Likewise, they \nexpressed no confidence in judicial bodies and thought that courts are where those with money \nand  influence  can  legalize  their  plunder  of  natural  resources.  Compared  with  most  executing \nagencies,  NGOs  are  seen  as  trying  to  be  pro-poor  in  practice  even  if  they  do  not  always \nsucceed. \n \n\nThe Transforming Structures and Processes \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nNGOs  offer  a  range  of  programs  that  directly  achieve  livelihood  outcomes.  Many \n31. \neffective NGOs  maintain a visible presence at all times. Highly effective NGOs actively co-opt \ncommunity members. Survey participants appeared to know more about the services offered by \nNGOs  than  those  offered  by  executing  agencies.  Some  even  spoke  of  the  kinds  of  services \nexecuting agencies should (and should not) provide. Village development committees have an \nimportant role to play. However, to be truly of use, they must improve their capabilities, as well \nas their mechanisms for horizontal networking with commune councils. \n \nAfter seeking to understand how the private sector makes investment decisions, survey \n32. \nparticipants  saw  no  reason  why  communities  could  not  link  arms  with  it  to  jointly  investigate \nlivelihood activities in cattle raising, fish processing, or non-timber forest products. \n \nSurvey participants want policy makers to experience life on and around the Tonle Sap. \n33. \nPolicy  makers  can  take  trips  to  see  multiple-engine  boats  equipped  with  illegal  fishing  gear \noperating late at night; ask armed personnel why they harass ordinary villagers; find out whether \nor not ethnic Vietnamese do indeed over-fish; and speak to people who have migrated in search \nof  livelihoods.  Merely  calculating  poverty  headcounts  and  then  arguing  that  nearly  40%  of  the \npopulation  lives  on  less  than  $0.65  a  day  is  a  meaningless  abstraction  to  the  poor  and \nvulnerable. Perhaps because of this distrust, it might be argued that the best pro-poor structures \nare  created  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable  themselves,  in  their  communities  rather  than  outside. \nThese  may  include  self-help  groups  focused  on  highly  specific  livelihood  outcomes.  But  the \nfailure  of  elite-controlled  governance  arrangements  does  not  negate  the  need,  at  the  central \nlevel, to build structures that represent the poor, reform structures that make policy and provide \nservices  to  the  poor,  provide  support  to  the  establishment  or  expansion  of  private  sector \norganizations, and support forums for decision making and action. \n \n34. \nregulations,  policies,  operational  arrangements, \nagreements, societal norms, and practices that, in turn, determine the way in which structures \noperate.  Policy-determining  structures  cannot  be  effective  in  the  absence  of  appropriate \ninstitutions and processes through which policies can be implemented. Processes are important \nto  every  aspect  of  livelihoods.  They  provide  incentives  that  stimulate  people  to  make  better \nchoices.  They  grant  or  deny  access  to  assets.  They  enable  people  to  transform  one  type  of \nasset into another through markets. They have a strong influence on interpersonal relations. \n \n35. \nOne  of  the main  problems  faced  by  the  poor and  vulnerable  is  that  the  processes  that \nframe their livelihoods may systematically restrict them unless the Government adopts pro-poor \npolicies that in turn filter down to legislation and even less formal processes. In October 2000, a \nprime  ministerial  decree  released  56%  of  the  lot  area  to  community  fisheries.  There  are  now \nmore than 160 designated community fisheries (or 300 management units) in the fishing lot area \nreleased from commercial fisheries. The release of lots to communities should benefit the latter \nif the resource is properly managed. \n \n36. \nSurvey  participants  from  fishing  villages  are  aware  that  using  illegal  fishing  gear  will \nreduce fish catches further. However, without these, they feel they cannot compete with others \nwho,  they  presume,  also  use  illegal  fishing  gear.  The  sub-decree  on  community  fisheries \nmanagement and the draft Fisheries Law are important transforming processes. \n \n37. \nThe social land concession program of the Government facilitates consultations with the \nlandless  and  land-poor.  It  provides  an  enabling  environment  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable. \nMicrofinance  organizations  need  to  adopt  processes  that  allow  a  more  flexible  response  to \n\nProcesses  embrace \n\nlaws, \n\nthe \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n27 \n\ncommunities,  such  as  extending  microfinance  facilities  to  savings  and  credit  groups  or  other \nself-help groups without undermining their own liquidity. \n \n38. \nThe private sector often queries the Government's pro-poor approach when transaction \ncosts  are  considerably  higher  than  in  neighboring  Thailand  or  Viet  Nam.  These  include  the \nexcise tax on diesel fuel, which the private sector considers too high, and whose cost, it says, is \noften borne by the very poor that development is supposed to help. \n \nLivelihood systems would soon cease to function if it were not for the active involvement \n39. \nof women. Irrespective of their ethnic background, women generally work longer hours each day \nthan  men.  They  are  less  likely  to  be  literate.  They  have  a  lower  profile  than  men.  Any  new \nprocess  that  advances  societal  norms  and  beliefs  in  relation  to  women  will  achieve  a  marked \nimprovement in livelihood outcomes. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n

The  cost  limit  for  each  village  is  $20,000  (refer  to  Table \nA4.1).  The  participatory \nlivelihoods  analyses  conducted  during  project \npreparation showed high priority for improvement of water supply and sanitation, \nrehabilitation and enlargement of schools, provision of houses for teachers, and \nconstruction  of  small  village  facilities  (e.g.,  community  meeting  rooms,  fish \nprocessing sheds and drying platforms, small produce stores, small markets, and \nsolar power supply for public buildings). New road construction is a special case \nthat would require clearance by the Ministry of Environment. \nIncome  generation.  Grants  for  income-generating  activities  will  be  available  to \ngroups and individuals. Non-rice agricultural income-generating activities include \nimproved  horticultural  production  using  production  of  pigs  and  drip  irrigation. \nFinancing  of  processing  and  marketing  may  be  applied  to  improved  techniques \nfor  (a)  drying,  smoking,  and  fermenting  fish;  (b)  producing  fermented  fish  paste \n(prahoc);1 (c) packaging and marketing dried and shelled shrimp; (d) producing, \npackaging, and marketing fish sauce; and (e) bulk fish purchasing and marketing. \nGrants  will  be  available  for  small-scale  industries  that  would  employ  relatively \nlarge numbers of people such as repair and maintenance of electrical and other \nappliances,  production  of  basketry  and  other  products  using  bamboo,  rattan, \nhyacinth,  and  other  non-timber  forest  products;  and  production  of  honey.  In \nsupport  of  income-generating  activities  grants  could  also  be  used  for  skills \ntraining (e.g., food processing and other vocational training) or for more general \neducation  such  as  adult  literacy.  Applications  would  need  to  show  that  at  least \n25% of the beneficiaries of grants are poor. \nSupport  to  community  fisheries.  The  community  livelihood  fund  grant  funds \nmay  also  be  used  to  support  the  implementation  of  community  fisheries \nthe  Tonle  Sap \nmanagement  plans,  prepared  under  component  2  of \nEnvironmental  Management  Project,2 \nthe \nDepartment  of  Fisheries  in  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries. \nThis supplementary assistance to community fisheries will enable communities to \nestablish  fish  sanctuaries  and  administrative  facilities,  procure  boats  and  other \nnecessary  equipment,  and  expand  the  range  and  frequency  of  monitoring  of \nillegal fishing practices. \n\nthat  have  been  approved  by \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  Prahoc  is  made  from  small  low-value  fish  such  as  trey  riel.  After  the  fish  are  washed,  the  head  and  scales  are \nremoved, the fish are salted and dried for a few days, and then the fish are stored in large ceramic pots to ferment. \nThe protein in prahoc is more digestible than that in fresh fish. Prahoc is thus an excellent food for the elderly and \nthe young. It is the main product made from excess fish. Families work together and businesses that make and sell \nprahoc hire many temporary workers. \n\n2   ADB.  2002.

grant  funds  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  will  be  deposited.  MEF  will  also  create  a  budget  line  item  in  the  commune  council \naccounts  to  be  used  for  the  Project.  Funds  will  be  released  on  the  basis  of  the  annual  work \nplans  prepared  by  the  commune  planning  and  budget  committees  with  the  help  of  commune \nfacilitators  and  the  community  livelihood  facilitation  teams.  Once  the  plans  are  complete,  the \ncommune  councils  will request  fund  transfers via  the  provincial  local administration  unit  of  the \nMinistry of Interior (MOI). The community  livelihood facilitation teams will screen each request \nfor eligibility and forward them through the provincial local administration unit to MOI. MOI will \nthen request MEF to release funds into a second-generation imprest account opened by MOI in \na commercial bank for the purpose of replenishing and liquidating the community livelihood fund \nand for other activities under the Project. MOI will then direct the funds to the commercial bank \naccounts  of  the  commune  councils.  It  is  proposed  that  funds  be  released  in  two  or  three \ntranches in year 1 to ensure that the system is operating well. \n \n2. \n\nThe commune councils will use the funds according to ADB's guidelines for: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\ndirect procurement of goods, \nprocurement of technical services for village project design, \ncontracting of public works and social infrastructure, \npayments to community groups for income-generating activities, and \npayments to community fisheries. \n\n \n3. \nproject accounting system that includes: \n\nProcurement and purchases undertaken by the commune councils will be recorded in a \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nprocurement details, including specifications of goods to be procured; \nrecord of three quotes obtained; \ncontract copies and procurement dates, suppliers and schedule of payment; \ninvoices and receipts; and \nbalanced cash-book that is reconciled each month with the statements from the \ncommercial bank. \n\n \n4. \nCommunity groups will be required to maintain simple balanced cashbooks showing the \nfunds  received  and  transferred  and  the  signatures  of  at  least  three  authorized  individuals \nattesting to the accuracy of the records, and to post a copy of the cashbook in a public place. \nThe  cashbooks  will  be  the  basis  of  project  accounting.  A  copy  of  each  cashbook  will  be \nforwarded to the commune council each month. The cash book will record: \nthe amounts of money received by date, with date of receipt; \nthe amounts of money paid, to whom and when; and \nthe goods and services purchased including the supplier's name and signature \nand sale documentation (receipts, invoices, etc.) for each item purchased. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n5. \nThe  planning  and  budget  committees  of  the  commune  councils  will  consolidate  all \nexpenditure  documentation,  forward  one  copy  to  the  project  manager  from  MOI,  and  retain  a \ncomplete set for the commune records and audit purposes. The project manager  must review \nand approve the expenditure documentation before the next tranche of funding can be released. \nIncomplete expenditure documentation will stop the flow of funds to the commune council. The \nproject manager will submit a consolidated statement of expense to ADB for the replenishment \nof the imprest account. \n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  project  area  comprises  316  villages  organized  into  37  communes,  with  about \n290,000  inhabitants  in  55,000  households.  Assuming  a  poverty  rate  of  50%,  about  145,000 \npersons in 27,500 households live below the poverty line. As women constitute more than half \nof  the  population,  at  least  72,500  women  in  the  project  area  live  in  poverty.  At  least  13,500 \nhouseholds are likely to be headed by women. \n \nThe  establishment  of  the  community  livelihood  fund  (CLF)  will  offer  women  an \n2. \nopportunity to secure sustainable livelihoods. The CLF will fund community-driven development \nthrough strengthened local participation in planning. While the CLF is derived from the present \nsystem of commune council accounts\u2014which receive funds directly from the national treasury\u2014\nthe Project will significantly augment the resources available to participating communes. It will \ndeepen  and  expand  the  participation  of  community  members,  particularly  women  and  other \nvulnerable  groups,  in  planning  and  deciding  on  priority  investments  and  associated  resource \nallocation, distribution, utilization, and accountability. \n \nA. \n \n3. \ncommune planning and resource allocation: \n\nThe Project will support the following measures for improved gender responsiveness in \n\nStrategy for Gender-Responsive Community-Driven Development \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nCompulsory  gender-sensitization  training  for  all  levels  of  staff  to  be  involved  in \nthe Project, as part of project management training. \nThe  inclusion  of  sessions  on  gender  analysis  and  gender-sensitive  monitoring \nindicators  in  training  for  project  staff  in  participatory  planning  and  performance \nmanagement  based  on  the  project  framework.  Gender-related  training  for \ncommunities  will  be  adapted  to  the  absorption  capacity  of  the  communities, \nparticularly  the  commune  councils  and  the  commune  planning  and  budgeting \ncommittees (CPBCs). \nProject  presentations  for  Government  agency  staff  and  for  beneficiaries  at \ncentral,  provincial,  and  commune  levels,  designed  to  lead  to  a  shared \nunderstanding of gender issues and the gender equality concerns of the Project. \nEnsuring  women's  full  participation  and  full  benefit  are  integral  to  realizing  the \nProject's outcome. \nThe establishment of gender focal points in each provincial community livelihood \nfacilitation team (CLFT). \nThe appointment of women to at least half of the commune facilitators posts. \nAt  least  equal  participation  of  women  from  poor  households  and  men  in  all \ncommunity-training programs. The training sessions should be short and to allow \nwomen with low literacy levels to participate. \nThe nomination of at least two staff members of each provincial departments of \nwomen's  affairs  to  the  CLFT  to  ensure  that  women  will  be  represented  and \ngender issues will be discussed at CLFT meetings. \n\nStrategy for Maximizing Women's Participation at the Commune Level \n\n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe Project will make the communities better able to formulate, implement, and manage \ndevelopment plans. To promote the participation of women in development planning so that the \nplans explicitly reflect the needs and concerns of women, the gender action plan envisages the \nfollowing: \n(i) \n\nWomen will be organized into planning groups in each community. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAt  the  start  of  the  Project,  specialized  teams,  including  members  from  the \nwomen's  affairs  office,  consultants/NGOs,  and  commune  facilitators,  will  join \nmeetings  of  women  in  the  communities  to  brief  these  groups  on  the  project \ncomponents  and  expected  outcome.  The  briefing  will  be  done  at  times  that  are \nconvenient to the women. \nAt  such  meetings,  women  will  be  encouraged  to  speak  about  their  livelihoods \nand their needs so that the proper use of project resources to benefit them and \ntheir communities can be determined. \nEach commune is expected to start with one women's planning organization. For \nthis, the women's groups will select leaders between 5 and 10 per organization \ninformation dissemination, training, and capacity building. \nThe  selected  leaders  will  be  trained  in  gender-responsive  planning  and \ndevelopment,  leadership  development,  and  accountability.  They  will  represent \nthe  women  in  the  different  organizations  (e.g.,  CPBC,  bidding  committee,  and \nproject  management  committee,  community  fisheries).  By  the  end  of  year  4,  at \nleast  half  of  all  CPBC  members  should  be  trained  women  representatives, \nselected directly by their women constituents. \n\n(vi)  Women  representatives  will  participate  in  commune  planning  to  ensure  that  the \ninterests  of  their  constituents  are  represented,  and  they  will  meet  weekly  with \ntheir constituents to brief them on the various activities. \n\n(vii)  Gender-responsive  commune  development  plans  will  be  reviewed  by  the \nwomen's planning group at a plenary meeting before these are submitted to the \nCPBC for consolidation. \nLocal women's groups will meet weekly and keep records of the proceedings to \naid monitoring by commune facilitators. \n\n(viii) \n\nStrategy for Gender-Sensitive Project Management \n\nThe Project will leverage the following gender-sensitive project management tools: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nGender focal points will be established in each CLFT. \nThe  gender  focal  points  will  meet  each  month  to  assess  gender-related \nachievements and gender issues encountered during project implementation. \nThe progress reports will include gender-related achievements. \nThe midterm review will determine if the targets set for the participation of women \nare being met, and draw up plans as appropriate. \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nDesign of Gender-Responsive Commune Development Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe CLFTs, along with the provincial and district gender focal points, will meet at least \ntwice  with  the  members  of  the  CPBC  and  women's  planning  groups  at  commune  level,  to \nidentify their needs and priorities and assist them in formulating sub-proposals to be included in \nthe CLF. \n(i) \n\nThe  CPBC  prioritization  exercise  should  include  separate  group  discussions  for \nwomen participants to screen activities proposed by women and the poor. \nThe  CLF  allocation  should  reflect  women's  practical  needs,  such  as  water \nsupplies,  sanitation,  and  health  services,  which  will  reduce  women's  work  load \nand free up time for income-generating activities. \n\n(ii) \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nDelivery of Investment Packages \n\nE. \n \n7. \nroads, wells, and latrines: \n\nFor  the  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  small-scale  infrastructure,  such  as  intra-village \n\nEnsuring  that  contractors'  agreements  contain  an  appropriate  clause  promoting \nthe hiring of women and equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. \nReserving  half  of  unskilled \nfor  women,  especially  women-headed \nhouseholds,  so  that  they  can  support  their  families  without  having  to  go  out  on \nboats with their small children to catch fish. \n\njobs \n\n \nFor rural water supply and sanitation, \n(i) \n\nEnsuring  the  appropriateness  of  awareness-raising  and  health  education \nmaterials,  training  packages,  and  manuals  to  the  literacy  level  of  women  in  the \nproject area, and emphasizing the important roles of women, especially married \nwomen, in operation and maintenance, as they rarely leave the communities. \nAssisting targeted communities in establishing water and sanitation user groups1 \nwhere  women  make  up  at  least  40%  of  the  board  members,  have  equal \nopportunity  to  receive  training,  and  participate  in  meetings  to  decide  on  the \nlocation and design of water points and latrines that meet the practical needs of \nwomen. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(ii) \n\nEducation for the Protection of Natural Resources \n\n \nF. \n \n8. \nGender  focal  points  and  consultants  will  facilitate  the  testing  of  awareness-raising \nmaterial on women's groups. This issue will also be incorporated in literacy classes, in schools, \nand in the child-to-child approach for out-of-school children. \n \nG. \n \n9. \n\nExpected Outcomes \n\nThe expected outcomes of the gender action plan are: \n(i) \n\nAll  project  entities  are  trained  in  gender-responsive  planning,  implementation, \nand monitoring. \nAt  least  half  of  all  community  fisheries,  CPBCs,  and  other  committees  are  fully \ntrained. \nAll selected commune councils have trained and articulate women members. \nIn all 316 villages, women take an active part in planning. \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v)  Women constitute at least 50% of social infrastructure groups/committees. \n(vi) \n\nTraining  in  participation  and  gender-responsive  project  monitoring  is  conducted \nfor all 316 villages. \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n1  National guidelines on water and sanitation user groups were drafted during the preparation of the proposed Tonle \nSap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. At least 40% of the boards of the water and sanitation user groups \nwill be formed to include at least 40% women and at least 50% the board members will receive technical training in \noperation and maintenance. The boards will also be representative of the ethnic composition of their members. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n\n No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n \n \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe Tonle Sap and its floodplains are home to 1.2 million people, of whom about 25% live in floating villages. Despite \nthe enormous productivity of the Tonle Sap's fisheries, which yield up 230,000 tons of fish each year (about 50% of \nCambodia's  freshwater-capture  fisheries  production),  declining  access  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  food  insecurity \nand  malnutrition.  Increasing  access  to  assets  offers  great  potential  for  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  is  the  second \ngrant  project  under  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  and  aims  to  improve  livelihoods,  with  close  attention  to  the  interests  of \nparticularly vulnerable groups such as women, poor fishing households, and ethnic minorities. \n \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nExtensive  livelihood  analyses  were  conducted  during  project  preparation  to  supplement  the  participatory  poverty \nassessment  being  conducted  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region.  These  analyses  provide  significant  information  about  the \nconcerns  of  the  poor  and  their  policy  implications.  Under  the  Project,  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  poverty \nreduction impact will be participatory. \n \n \nC. \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nParticipation Process \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n No \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n Yes  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nExtensive stakeholder analysis was carried out during project preparation. Using the livelihood approach, the analysis \nwas aimed at acquiring a wider and better-informed view of the opportunities, constraints, objectives, and interactions \nthat  characterize  peoples'  lives  in  the  project  area.  The  analysis  first  explored  the  relationships  between  the  five \ncategories  of  livelihood  assets.  It  then  identified  and  prioritized,  with  beneficiaries  and  partners  such  as \nnongovernment  organizations,  entry  points  that  can  significantly  affect  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor.  Specifically,  the \nanalysis  (i)  identified  links  across  sectors,  between  field  and  policy  levels,  and  between  urban  and  rural  areas;  (ii) \nsuggested  a  range  of  high-yielding,  priority  entry  points;  and  (iii)  provided  a  basis  for  the  design  of  project  activities \nthat are appropriately sequenced and accommodate intercommunity relations and potentially conflicting interests. The \ntools  that  were  used  were  not  discrete  and  overlapped  internally.  They  included  environmental  checklists,  gender \nanalysis,  governance  assessment,  institutional  appraisal,  macroeconomic  analysis,  market  analysis,  participatory \npoverty  assessment  techniques,  risk  assessment,  social  analysis,  stakeholder  analysis,  conflict  assessment,  and \nenvironmental assessment. Rapid and participatory methods and sample surveys complemented these tools. Policies, \ninstitutions, and processes for sustainable livelihoods were also analyzed to determine how they relate to one another \nand how they influence livelihoods. \n \nThe  Project's  participation  strategy  is  straightforward,  tried,  and  tested  because  the  planning  and  approval  of  small-\nscale  community-driven  activities  will  follow  the  procedures  of  the  commune/sangkat  fund.  To  further  ensure  that \ncommunities  are  truly  involved  in  project  implementation,  the  Project  also  provides  for  the  posting  of  commune \nfacilitators in each commune within the project area. Additionally, the Project will attach to each community livelihood \nfacilitation  team  domestic  consultants  who  will  be  responsible  for  guiding,  training,  fielding,  and  supporting  the  line \nagency staff and commune facilitators in the performance of their duties. \n \nThe Project will also give ethnic minorities equal opportunities to participate. Built-in design features exist to meet their \nneeds,  and  demonstrable  benefit  to  ethnic  minorities  is  a  criterion  for  activities  eligible  for  financing  under  the \ncommunity  livelihood  fund.  The  Project  will  also  facilitate  the  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  community-driven \ndevelopment  process  through  the  community  livelihood  fund:  the  community  livelihood  facilitation  teams  will  pay \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nparticular  attention  to  the  empowerment  of  these  minorities  by  organizing  them  into  homogeneous  groups  for \nlivelihood  activities.  The  Project  will  thus  offer  ethnic  minorities  real  chances  to  participate  in  village  and  commune \nplanning  and  to  identify  priority  investments.  The  Government  has  given  assurances  that  there  will  be  no  ethnic \ndiscrimination and that equal opportunities will be given to all. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project will support the organization and capacity building of women at the community level to bring about their \nfull representation  and  participation in community-based  organizations.  The Project includes targets  for  women's full \naccess to decision making and livelihood assets. It will provide continuous gender sensitization training for all project \nstaff  at  all  levels.  All  the  project  targets  will  be  monitored  through  gender-sensitive  monitoring  frameworks.  Women \nfrom ethnic minorities will also benefit from this strategy. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE. \n \nItem \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \n \nConstruction  of  small  piped-water-supply  systems,  wells, \nor intra-village roads may entail minor acquisition of land. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared to guide planning and implementation according \nto ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\nLabor \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n \nN/A \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Framework \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n \nThe Project will generate employment by providing social \ninfrastructure and other livelihood assets. \n\n \nThere  are  no  indigenous  peoples  in  the  project  area.

An area of terrestrial and coastal or marine ecosystems, or a combination \nthereof. Biosphere reserves are nominated by governments and remain under their jurisdiction. \nThey must meet a minimal set of criteria and adhere to a minimal set of conditions before being \nadmitted  to  the  World  Network  of  Biosphere  Reserves  of  the  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific,  and  Cultural  Organization.  Reserves  are  intended  to  fulfill  three  complementary \nfunctions:  (i)  a  conservation  function,  (ii)  a  development  function,  and  (iii)  a  logistic  function. \nBiosphere reserves contain one or more core areas that are securely protected sites, a clearly \nidentified buffer zone, and a flexible transition area. \n \n", " \n", "for \n", "functions \n", "Buffer zone. A zone that usually surrounds or adjoins core areas, and is used for cooperative \nactivities  compatible  with  sound  ecological  practices,  including  environmental  education, \nrecreation,  ecotourism,  and  research.  In  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve,  a  buffer  zone  of \nabout  5,400  square  kilometers  (km2)  surrounds  the  core  areas  up  to  the  outer  limit  of  the \nflooded forest. \n \nCommune councils. In Cambodia, a body that governs commune administration. In addition to \nfulfilling  their  administrative  tasks,  they  engage  in  dispute  resolution,  plan  and  implement \nthe  central  and  provincial \ndevelopment  projects,  provide  some  agency \ngovernments,  and  conduct  advocacy.  Development  activities  consist  mainly  of  small-scale \ninfrastructure  and  public  goods  projects.  Every  commune  council  has  a  commune  chief,  who \nalso  acts  as  presiding  commune  councilor.  The  commune  chief  has  two  assistants,  a  first \ndeputy  chief  and  a  second  deputy  chief,  who  come  from  among  the  elected  councilors.  The \ncommune chief may also appoint advisory committees. \n \nCommunity  fisheries.  In  Cambodia,  (i)  a  form  of  co-management  in  which  a  community  of \npeople,  usually  a  village  or  group  of  villages,  is  recognized  and  empowered  as  a  co-\nmanagement  unit  for  fisheries;  and  (ii)  a  clearly  defined  and  demarcated  area  in  the  fisheries \ndomain  that  is  allocated  to  a  community  for  management.  The  sub-decree  on  community \nfisheries  management  defines  community  fisheries  as  a  group  of  persons  holding  Cambodian \ncitizenship  living  in  or  near  a  community  fishing  area,  voluntarily  established,  and  initiated  to \nimprove livelihoods by using fisheries resources sustainably  for economic development, social \nimprovement, and poverty reduction. \n \nCommunity  management.  The  community-based  management  of  local  natural  resources, \nincluding certain designated fishing areas, with support from relevant authorities, and institutions \nand organizations. \n \nCore areas. Securely protected sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed \necosystems,  and  undertaking  research  and  other  low-impact  uses  such  as  education.  In  the \nTonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve,  core  areas  are  in  Prek  Toal  (213  km2),  Battambang;  Boeng \nTonle  Chhmar  (Moat  Kla)  (145.6  km2),  Kompong  Thom;  and  Stung  Sen  (63.5  km2),  Kompong \nThom. They are characterized, respectively, by a flooded forest, streams and water bodies, and \nrich biodiversity. Nearly 100 water bird species are found there, a dozen of which are of global \nsignificance. The areas are also known for their fish, mammals, and reptiles. \n \nFisheries  domain.  A  body  of  water,  defined  by  law,  that  includes  practically  all  inland  waters \nexcept man-made ponds and reservoirs, as well as areas that are only temporarily aquatic such \nas the flooded forest. The Department of Fisheries is responsible for it. \n \nFishing gear. Any equipment used for fishing. More than 200 different types of gear are in use \non the Tonle Sap. They range from large-scale gear such as barrage traps and bagnets; middle-\nscale gear such as arrow-shaped traps, drift seine nets, rafted mounted lift nets, and scooping \nnets;  to  family-scale  gear  such  as  gill  nets,  small  traps,  single  long  lines,  small  dip  nets,  and \ncast nets. Almost all gear is developed locally. \n \nFishing  lots.  Exclusive  geographic  areas  that  are  awarded  through  a  competitive,  public \nbidding system for a period of 2 consecutive years, with the auction fee payable for each of the \ntwo fishing seasons. They range in size from 20 to 500 km2 and may include lake areas, river \nareas, and a flooded forest. The largest are found on the Tonle Sap. The operator of each lot \nhas the right to harvest fish according to the burden book for the lot. The burden book describes \n"]}
