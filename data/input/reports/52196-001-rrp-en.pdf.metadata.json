The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  (i) \nadministration of a loan, and (ii) administration of technical assistance (TA), both to be provided \nby the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), for the Scaling Up Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Sector \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan and the administration of the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe project will be the second Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan to EESL to support \nthe  expansion  of  investments  in  energy  efficiency.  The  project  will  follow  tested  and  improved \nnew business models to exploit vast investment opportunities in energy efficiency. Key areas of \nintervention  will  include  (i)  deployment  of  distributed  solar  photovoltaic  systems  in  rural \nagricultural areas, smart meters, and electric vehicles (e-vehicles) with charging stations; and (ii) \nend-user energy-efficiency awareness and capacity development. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIndia  witnessed  strong  economic  expansion  between  FY2003  and  FY2016,  when  the \neconomy grew by an average of about 7.2%. Annual carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion \nhave grown even faster, from 0.89 billion tons in 2000 to 1.87 billion tons in 2013 to 2.02 billion tons \nin 2016. 2 The energy mix in India is still largely based on fossil fuels and is dominated by coal even \nthough the country is striving to achieve cumulative 175 gigawatts of renewables by 2022 from about \n80 gigawatts as of August 2019. India\u2019s energy-efficiency potential remains largely untapped, with \npotential annual energy savings of more than 220,000 gigawatt-hours\u2014equivalent to about 17% \nof the country\u2019s total power generated in FY2019.3 \n \n4. \nSector development plan. The Government of India (the government) has recognized the \nneed  to  achieve  more  sustainable  economic  growth  while  reducing  carbon  emissions.  The  Energy \nConservation  Act  (2001)  formalized  the  government\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  demand  for  energy \nwithout  jeopardizing  growth  by  increasing  energy  efficiency.  The  2010  National  Mission  for \nEnhanced  Energy  Efficiency  was  one  of  eight  national  missions  by the  government  under  the \nNational Action Plan on Climate Change, launched in 2008. National missions are designed to \nintroduce innovative business models to strengthen the market for energy efficiency products and \nservices.  In April 2015, the government launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 to \nsupport increased usage of e-vehicles. The India National Smart Grid Mission (Phase 2, 2017\u20122020) \nelucidates  key  objectives  and  guidelines  for  reducing  system  losses,  deploying  advanced  metering \ninfrastructure, promoting energy storage solutions, and increasing e-vehicle usage.  Advance metering \ninfrastructure includes smart meters and communications devices that allow end-users to track \nelectricity  consumption  and  allow  distribution  companies  to  plan  and  improve  billing  and \ncollection efficiency.  \n\n \n\n1   CTF is the fund of about $5.4 billion under the Climate Investment Funds established by approval of the International \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  executive  directors  on  1  July  2008  and  governed  under  the  CTF \nGovernance Framework.   \n\n2  International Energy Agency.

Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIn  2015,  the  government  pledged,  through  its  nationally  determined  contribution  to  the \n5. \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to reduce the energy intensity of its \neconomy by 33%\u201335% from 2005 levels by 2030.4 To meet its 2015 pledge, the government must \naddress several barriers. These barriers are (i) on the regulatory side, most distribution utilities \ncontinue to subsidize retail electricity prices, and energy-efficiency programs remain voluntary; \n(ii) at the institutional level, capacity to scale up energy-efficient technologies remains limited; (iii) \non the financial side, the economic benefits of investments, even when quantifiable, cannot be \nreadily monetized and delivered as upfront financing; and (iv) on the consumer awareness side, \nunderstanding of energy-saving technologies and associated benefits remains limited, which in \nturn limits market penetration. \n \nBorrower. EESL, established  as a public sector energy service company (ESCO)5  in \n6. \n2009, is a joint venture of four public sector undertakings of the Ministry of Power (MoP): NTPC \nLimited,  Powergrid  Corporation  of  India  Limited,  Power  Finance  Corporation,  and  Rural \nElectrification Corporation.6  As  an  implementing  arm  of  the  Bureau  of  Energy Efficiency  under \nMoP,  EESL  pursues  large-scale  energy  efficiency  focused  investments  with  a  comprehensive \nservice package of project design, implementation, monitoring, and investment. ADB approved a \nloan to EESL in 2016 for the Demand Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project, which focuses on \nefficient lighting and appliances, and is being implemented in a satisfactory manner.7 EESL has \nalso  successfully  implemented  several  similar  projects  supported  by the  German  development \ncooperation through KfW, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, and the World Bank. \n \n7. \nThe approach of Energy Efficiency Services Limited. The company\u2019s overall approach \nis evolving to create a cycle of more innovation, more transparency, and more transformation. It \nadopts  low-emission  solutions  that  deliver  benefits  across  all  levels:  individuals,  institutions, \nutilities,  and  the  government.  EESL  implements  rigorous  energy  audits  and  technology  needs \nassessments, followed up by pilot projects to assess performance and calculate energy savings. \nEESL invests in and implements projects and retains operational responsibility through service \nlevel agreements throughout the project life. Typically, EESL is paid back by the beneficiary over \ntime from the resulting energy savings, thereby addressing the upfront cost barriers that hinder \nsome  energy-efficiency  projects.  Repayment  terms  are  based  in  part  on  a  deemed  savings \napproach.8 Furthermore, EESL regularly invests and partners with other technology developers \nand  private  sector  ESCOs  to  pilot-test  and  promote  new  energy-efficient  technologies  and \nbusiness models. ADB is administering a grant from the Global Environment Facility to support \nexpansion of EESL\u2019s ESCO business to new energy-efficient technologies.9 \n \nRationale  for  sector  lending.  The  sector  loan  modality  allows  for  implementation  of \n8. \nsubprojects  with  high  readiness  and  inclusion  of  newer  subprojects  as  they  are  developed, \n\n \n\n4  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Environment,  Forest  and  Climate  Change.  2015.

Manila. \n\n8  A deemed savings approach involves upfront estimation of energy savings that will be achieved from the project, \n\nwhich is agreed by both parties and serves as the basis for annuity payments made during the project life. \n\n9  ADB is supporting EESL in setting up a revolving fund to pilot-test new technologies and business models through \nAdditional Financing - Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project of $13 million approved in September 2018. \nEESL is developing a new Global Environment Facility project to promote e-mobility in India with ADB and the UN \nEnvironment Programme as partners. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\firrespective of their physical location. A sector roadmap of the Government of India is available \n(para. 4), and adequate implementation capacity in EESL and states exists (para.  7). Therefore, \nthe sector loan modality is considered appropriate. The loan will also complement support from \nother development partners such as the World Bank, KfW, and others. \n \n9. \nAlignment with ADB priorities. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which aims to boost economic competitiveness to create more and \nbetter  jobs;  provide  inclusive  access  to  infrastructure  networks  and  services;  address  climate \nchange  through  renewable  energy  development,  energy  efficiency,  and  development  of  low-\ncarbon and nonmotorized transit; and increase climate resilience.10 The project will also contribute \nto  meeting  ensuring  access  to  affordable,  reliable,  sustainable  and  modern  energy  for  all \n(Sustainable Development Goal 7). The project is aligned with the following operational priorities \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030:11  \naddressing \ninvestments \nconsumers);  \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability (through large-scale investments in distributed clean \nenergy, smart grid, and electric transport services);  \n\nremaining  poverty  and \n(by  prioritizing \nthat  provide  more  reliable  electricity  services  to  agricultural \n\ninequalities \n\nreducing \n\n (i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)   making cities more livable (through investments in electrified transport services);  \naccelerating progress in gender equality (by providing training and awareness for \n(iv)  \nwomen in the project areas); and  \npromoting  rural  development  and  food  security  (by  providing  more  reliable \nelectricity services to agricultural consumers). \n\n(v)  \n\nProject Description \n\n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: emissions intensity of economy reduced.12 \n10. \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  end-use  energy  efficiency  in  the  project  areas \nincreased.13 \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Energy-efficient  technologies  in  utility  service  areas  in  eligible  states \n(including  Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Delhi,  Gujarat,  Jharkhand,  Maharashtra, \nManipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, and Uttar \nPradesh)  promoted and deployed.14  EESL has successfully  created  a  \u201cnew  normal\u201d  for more \nefficient  lighting,  pumping,  and  buildings.  EESL  is  now  expanding  its  market  scope  to  include \n\u201cupstream\u201d efficiency opportunities that have not been targeted by traditional ESCO investments, \nincluding  smart  meters,  distributed  solar  photovoltaic  systems,  and  e-vehicles.  Installation  of \ndistributed solar photovoltaic systems will reduce network losses, improve power quality  in the \nlow-voltage  electricity  distribution  network,  and  reduce  the  need  for  new  centralized  electricity \ngeneration  plants.

The aim of \nthis  output  is  to  create  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  using  energy-efficient  technologies,  and \npersuade people to adopt; and other key stakeholders such as distribution companies to promote \nenergy-efficient measures. EESL\u2019s business is concentrated on the retail end of the energy supply \nchain, and as such is dependent on consumer acceptance of efficiency interventions. Awareness \ncampaigns under this output will engage local organizations in knowledge-sharing and training \nactivities, with a focus on women electricity consumers. Capacity building for electricity distribution \ncompanies, electricity regulatory agencies, and other government agencies is another component \nof this output.   \n \n\n13. \nCore  subprojects.  EESL  and  ADB  have  conducted  due  diligence  of  sample  core \nsubprojects in distributed solar, smart metering, and e-vehicle deployment in Maharashtra and \nAndhra Pradesh.15 EESL will ensure that all subprojects contribute to the sector development plan \n(para.  4).  EESL  and  ADB  will  appraise,  select,  and  approve  subprojects  following  criteria  and \nprocedures outlined in the project administration manual (PAM), to the satisfaction of ADB.16 The \neligibility criteria for sub-projects include: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nhave a detailed project report completed in a format and to a level of detail that are \nacceptable to ADB; \nhave all counterparty arrangements agreed, including implementation schedules \nand repayment terms; \nbe scheduled for completion no later than March 2025; \nyield  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  exceeding  its  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital, with an economic internal rate of return of at least 9%; \nmeet  category  C  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  for  environment, \nindigenous people, and involuntary resettlement; and \nuse no funds from other bilateral and multilateral sources, unless complementary \narrangements  are  clearly  agreed  beforehand, \nto  avoid  duplication  and \ndouble counting. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \nEffective gender mainstreaming approaches will be undertaken for each output to maximize \n14. \ngains where appropriate. The project will build on the experience gained since 2016, expanding the \nscope of EESL\u2019s operations to include activities which have not been addressed by the traditional \nESCO business, specifically distributed solar photovoltaic systems, e-vehicles, and smart metering. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe project  will  incorporate  lessons  learned from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Demand  Side  Energy \nEfficiency Sector Project. The loan will help scale up promotion of demand-side energy efficiency \ntechnologies and replicate the successes of and lessons learned from the ongoing ADB project. \nThese include (i) providing sufficient timeline and manpower for EESL to reach agreement and \nimplement  subprojects  in  the  eligible  states;  and  (ii)  provision  for  large  contract  package  with \nmultiple smaller lots to address manufacturing constraints while maintaining economy of scale for \ncost reduction and quality assurance. The project will also complement other ADB energy sector \ninvestment  operations,  even  though  most  of  those  are  on  the  supply  side\u2014in  electricity \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. This will be one of the few ADB projects that specifically \n\n15 Subprojects  from  other  states  where  ADB  operates  may  also  be  included,  subject  to  further  due  diligence  and \n\nacceptance by ADB following its eligibility requirements. \n\n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\ffocuses on demand-side energy efficiency and business models; this model can be scaled up in \nIndia and other ADB developing member countries. EESL continues to investigate opportunities \nto expand its services and create new market opportunities for its new technologies. One way it \ndoes this is through large-scale deployment of new business models such as leasing e-vehicles \nto  remove  up-front  cost  barriers  to  vehicle  users.  Investments  in  distributed  solar  use  proven \ntechnologies combined with a relatively new business model for clean energy services. The smart \nmetering  component  will  represent  one of  the most  comprehensive  efforts  to  implement  smart \nmetering  among  ADB  developing  member  countries.

The \n\n17 ADB  received  a  formal  request  of  investment  support  of  $500  million  from  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs, \n\nMinistry of Finance on 24 May 2018 for this project being processed in a phased manner. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nremaining  financing  will  be  mobilized  by  EESL,  including  debt  from  other  lenders  and \nequity contributions. \n \n19. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to: \n(i)  smart  meters;  (ii)  distributed  solar  photovoltaic  systems;  and  (iii)  e-vehicles  and  charging \ninfrastructure.  CTF  will  provide  loan  cofinancing  equivalent  for  distributed  solar  photovoltaic \nsystems, to  be administered by  ADB.  EESL  will  finance taxes,  equipment  installation charges, \ncontingencies, financing charges during implementation, and the cost of awareness campaigns. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\n   Source \n   Asian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan) \n\nG Clean Technology Funda \n\n    Energy Efficiency Services Limited \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n250.0 \n        46.0 \n\n296.0 \n\n     592.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n42.2 \n       7.8 \n\n50.0 \n\n   100.0 \n\na  Loan  to  be  administered  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank;  loan  amount  includes  administrative  fees  and  other \n\ncharges as may be deducted pursuant to the cofinancing agreement. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on discussions with Energy Efficiency Services Limited. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nClimate  mitigation  is  estimated  to  cost  $154.3  million.

Areas  of  support  will  include \n23. \nexpanding  policy  dialogue  with  the  government,  implementing  the  gender  action  plan  for  the \nproject,  mobilizing  private  sector  participation  in  energy-efficiency  services,  identifying  new \nbusiness opportunities, transferring knowledge about successful energy-efficiency investments, \nand  pilot-testing  new  technologies  and  business  models.  Additionally,  the  TA  will  support  (i) \nproject  management  consultants  (primarily  for  monitoring  and  reporting);  (ii)  technology  and \nbusiness  model  analyses;  (iii)  identification  and  development  of  remaining  subprojects;  (iv) \nmapping of candidate sites for e-vehicle charging systems; (v) selective pilot-testing of promising \ntechnologies that can be rapidly deployed at scale; (vi) key elements of the gender action plan; \nand (vii) workshops and seminars.18  \n \n24. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the CTF and administered by ADB. EESL will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nThe  project  will  adopt  advanced  proven  energy-efficient  technologies  including  grid-\nconnected  solar  photovoltaic,  e-vehicles  and  charging  systems,  and smart  metering  to  reduce \nelectricity  network  losses  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  distributed  solar \ncomponent  will  generate  electricity  at  distribution  substations  in  rural  areas;  this  will  help \ndistribution companies reduce technical losses and achieve performance targets. Smart metering \nimproves  billing  and  collection  efficiency  and  facilitates  introduction  of  more  efficient  and \ninteractive pricing and demand response options allowing customers and utilities to reduce their \ncosts. E-vehicles reduce overall energy consumption and reduce street-level emissions, providing \ndirect public health benefits. It is expected that the project\u2019s energy savings will total 266 gigawatt-\nhours  annually,  while  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be  reduced  by  245,000  tons  of  carbon \ndioxide (tCO2) annually.19 EESL has confirmed that equipment and systems will be (i) suitable for \nlocal  conditions;  taking  into  account  issues  such  as  mandated  reliability  and  the  quality  of  the \nelectricity  supply;  (ii)  backed  by  warranties  and maintenance  contracts  from  suppliers,  system \n\n18  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The estimated emissions reductions are from the distributed solar photovoltaic component only to be conservative \n\nand 19% capacity factor and 0.92 tCO2 per megawatt-hour emission factor are used. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nintegrators,  and  service  providers;  and  (iii)  serviceable  locally.  The  technical  specifications  for \nenergy-efficient  technologies  will  comply  with  national  and  international  standards.  Laboratory \ntesting of samples of procured equipment will be undertaken to include both safety and equipment \nlife parameters.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project  is  economically  and financially  viable.20  Distributed  solar  subprojects  under \n26. \noutput 1 will provide clean daytime electricity supply at the point of demand for rural consumers, \nreducing  upstream  network  losses  and  displacing  coal-fired  power  generation.  They  will  also \nprovide  secondary  economic  benefits  via  improved  power  quality,  particularly  voltage  levels. \nEESL  wants  to  spark  India\u2019s  e-vehicle  aspirations  by aggregating  public  sector  demand  for  e-\nvehicles, thereby guaranteeing substantial volumes to allow prospective manufacturers to invest \nin domestic e-vehicle manufacturing facilities. In turn, this will demonstrate that, despite India\u2019s \nheavy  reliance  on  coal-fired  generation,  e-vehicles  can  still  generate  net  environmental  and \neconomic benefits. Smart metering provides a direct means through which electricity distributors \ncan  address  pervasive  billing  and  collection  inefficiencies  (collectively  termed  \u201ccommercial \nlosses\u201d). Although most of these avoided losses will be converted into sales with no net economic \nbenefit, a significant reduction in wasteful end use of energy (an economic resource cost saving) \nis still expected. The economic internal rates of return for the subprojects are 9.5% for e-vehicles, \n15.7% for distributed solar photovoltaic, and 16.6% for smart meters. Questions remain over the \nexpected  life  of  the  e-vehicle  batteries.  EESL  is  largely  insulated  from  this  risk  by  way  of \nmanufacturers\u2019 performance warranties, but shorter-than-expected battery life still represents a \nrisk to the subproject\u2019s economic performance. \n \n27. \nADB conducted a financial analysis of one sample subproject for each of the subproject \nareas of intervention (distributed solar photovoltaic systems, e-vehicles, and smart meters) being \nfinanced by ADB under output 1. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), calculated on a real \npost-tax basis (and assuming no reflow of loan proceeds) is 2.70% for the smart meter subproject \nand 3.23% for the e-vehicle subproject\u2014in both cases higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.20%. In the case of the distributed solar subproject, which is also cofinanced by the \nCTF loan, the real post-tax FIRR is 1.1% per annum, against a weighted average cost of capital \nof 0.5%. The analysis indicates that the project would generate an even higher FIRR if subsequent \nreflows from the investments are considered. Although the ADB loan is for a 20\u2012year tenor, cost \nrecovery of assets financed under the project (except distributed solar photovoltaic which will earn \nrevenue over 25 years) would range from 6 years to 8 years. Consequently, the tenor of the ADB \nloan is substantially longer than the tenor of the cash reflows that EESL will receive through a \ntransfer  of  assets.  EESL will  use  such  cash  flows  for  similar  subprojects  until  the  ADB  loan is \nrepaid, which may widen the impact of the project. \n \nEESL\u2019s  financial  performance  during  2017\u20132019  has  shown  aggressive  growth,  with \n28. \nrevenue increasing from \u20b912.3 billion in FY2017 to \u20b919.4 billion in FY2019, and post-tax profit \nincreasing  to  \u20b9951  million  in  FY2019  from  \u20b9519  million  in  FY2017.  EESL\u2019s  investment  plan  is \nambitious  and  will  be  a  challenge  from  the  perspectives  of  access  to  investment  capital  and \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n \n \n\n20 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nC. \n \n29. \nAll  subprojects  will  be  revenue-generating  and  financially  sustainable.  Rigorous \nsubproject selection criteria will ensure that only financially and economically viable projects are \nselected. The ESCO business model adopted by EESL implies that the annuity is set to recover \nthe full cost of debt, plus a return on equity including income tax. Other costs, like taxes, duties, \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  charges  would  be  billed  and  recovered  periodically  at \nactuals.21 Payment is secured by way of escrow accounts, state government guarantee, and/or \nletters  of  credit.  EESL  is  also  continuing  its  focus  on  collections.  The  subprojects  are  also \ninherently sustainable with respect to environmental and social safeguards criteria (category C) \nand EESL\u2019s implementation capacity. \n \nEESL  is  exploring  various  avenues  to  improve  its  current  financial  standing  including \n30. \nincreasing its equity base, to diversify funding sources to meet its growing financing requirements. \nDepending on the progress, and in due course, ADB may consider further assistance to EESL \nfrom its nonsovereign operations. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial management risk  is  moderate  mainly  because of \nEESL\u2019s  established  financial  management  systems,  its  experience  with  ADB  procurement \nprocedures,  and  its  satisfactory  progress  on  the  ongoing  Demand-Side  Energy  Efficiency \nSector Project. \n \nFinancial  management  assessment.  EESL  has  robust  budgeting  and  accounting \n32. \nsystems  in  place,  a  finance  department  staffed  by  accounting  professionals,  an  integrated \nenterprise  resource  planning  system,  and  experience  implementing  ADB-funded  projects.  The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk arising out of higher volumes of receivables \nfrom  its  customers  in  the  urban  and  energy  sectors  and  implementation  risk  due  to  EESL\u2019s \nstrategy to diversify its business segments. EESL\u2019s customers are mainly government agencies \nthat face liquidity issues and, consequently, are not prompt with their payments. EESL and state \ngovernments are aware of the situation and are taking measures to address the issue. EESL has \nagreed to  significantly  reduce  its  receivables  balances  to  manageable  levels  within  the  next  3 \nyears. In addition, the external auditors have issued qualified audit opinions on EESL financial \nstatements for improvements in financial reporting. \n \nADB has been engaging continuously with EESL to evaluate and improve EESL\u2019s internal \n33. \ngovernance, receivables monitoring, and financial reporting. ADB has assessed EESL\u2019s financial \nmanagement  action  plan  and  determined  that  EESL  has  complied  with  financial  management \nrequirements  by  formulating  and/or  implementing  (i)  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management \nframework, (ii) a framework for protection of project assets, and (iii) a framework for monitoring \npayment security. EESL has also agreed to an ADB requirement to appoint a chief risk officer to \nformulate a risk policy, taking into consideration the business plan of EESL. Under the attached \nTA, a financial management expert will assist EESL in improving financial management. \n \n34. \nProject  procurement  risk  assessment.  EESL  has  a  well-developed  procurement \nsystem and a procurement policy that complies with the government\u2019s General Financial Rules, \n2017. Its procurement department is staffed by experienced professionals who have extensive \n\n21 EESL recovers O&M charges, including insurance, on a pass-through basis based on incurred costs, capped at 2%\u2013\n\n4% of project cost. Any differential between this and actual O&M costs would accrue to EESL. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nexperience  delivering  projects  of  similar  size  and  complexity  using  open  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. As per government guidelines, EESL has adopted an e-procurement system that is \ncompliant with the Information Technology Act, 2000 and has been reviewed and is being used \nin ADB projects. Existing information management systems are easily accessed and can provide \ndata  to  support  contract  negotiations,  dispute  resolutions,  and  required  audits.  EESL  is \nimplementing  ADB-funded  project  and  is  familiar  with  ADB  procurement  requirements  and \nprocesses.  ADB  will  also  continue  to  provide  assistance  in  developing  standard  bidding \ndocuments to facilitate the smooth implementation of procurement plans and conduct prior review \nfor procurement packages. The ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers  will  be  used  for  procurement  packages  that  use  ADB  loan  proceeds.  Lowered \nprocurement transaction cost through the use of the borrower\u2019s e-procurement system has also \nbeen considered to achieve value for money under strategic planning process. For procurement \nof goods and services for components of the project that use counterpart funds, EESL will follow \nits existing policies and rules. \n \nADB conducted integrity due diligence and identified no significant integrity risks.22 ADB\u2019s \n35. \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  EESL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n36. \nThe project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial  well-being  through  reduced  electricity  consumption,  reduced  energy  consumption  in \ntransportation services, improved consumer awareness of electricity consumption patterns, and \nimproved  access  to  energy-efficient  appliances  for  consumers.  Project  beneficiaries  will  be \nspread  across  the  regions  covered  by  the  project  and  will  include  agricultural,  residential,  and \ninstitutional consumers, and electricity distribution companies in selected states in India. People \nwill  benefit  from  (i)  economic  investment  and  growth,  (ii)  improvements  in  basic  infrastructure, \nand (iii) continued community support. A stakeholder communication plan will include end-user \nawareness programs in subproject areas that emphasize women\u2019s participation, gender-sensitive \ntraining, and the adoption and use of energy-efficient technologies. \n \n37. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project \nincludes  affirmative  gender  actions  that  will  maximize  benefits  to  women.  EESL  and  ADB \nconducted extensive consultations with stakeholders in preparing a gender action plan with well-\ndefined activities, indicators, targets, and time frames. The gender action plan provides activities \nintegrated within the project design, including (i) training women as commercial drivers, (ii) training \nrural  women  in  energy-efficient  technologies  to  expand  their  existing  businesses  or  start  new \nbusinesses,  (iii)  end-user  energy-efficiency  awareness  programs  with  at  least  40%  women \nparticipation,  (iv)  report  preparation  by  EESL  on  good  practices  in  gender  mainstreaming  in \nenergy-efficiency investments in EESL, and (v) orientation for EESL project staff on gender issues \nand gender mainstreaming practices in the energy sector. EESL will collect, monitor, and report \non sex-disaggregated project data. Toward project completion, EESL will conduct a study (with \nat least 50% women respondents) to assess the benefits of using energy-efficient technologies \nand  appliances  in  the  households.  The  attached  TA  will  finance  a  gender  action  plan  for  the \nproject.23 A gender specialist will be engaged under the attached TA to guide implementation of \nthe project\u2019s gender action plan. \n\n22 ADB. 2003.

As required by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for a \nsector  loan,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  by \nEESL to guide subproject selection, screening and categorization, environmental assessment, and \ninstitutional arrangements. The EARF specifies that only category C subprojects, according to ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), will be considered for funding. All subprojects will have energy-\nefficient  management  and  technology  systems  in  place  that  minimize  energy  losses  and  reduce \ncarbon  dioxide  emissions.  These  interventions  will  generate  some  waste,  which  will  be  collected, \nstored,  transported,  and  disposed  of  following  the  requirements  and  regulations  of  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment, Forest and Climate Change. EESL and its contractors will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and national environmental, health, and safety regulations in managing any \nwaste  that  the  project  may  generate.  EESL  will  keep  a  record  of  any  waste  disposed,  including \nrelevant permits and/or waste destruction certificates, following the requirements of the Ministry of \nEnvironment, Forest and Climate Change and the central and state pollution control boards. EESL \nwill  require  its  contractors  to  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and to follow the environment, health, and safety requirements \nof the government as the guarantor, the relevant state, and ADB. EESL will assign staff to the project \nmanagement unit to (i) manage potential environmental issues and compliance with the EARF, and \n(ii)  monitor  the  compliance  of  contractors  and  implementing  partners  with  environmental \nrequirements. \n \n40. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  activities  are  not  expected  to  cause \nphysical or economic displacement, nor will they require private land acquisition and/or government \nland  transfer.  Solar  photovoltaic  systems  will  be  installed  on  the  existing  premises  of  substations \nbelonging  to  distribution  companies  and  will  connect  to  the  existing  distribution  infrastructure.  E-\nvehicle  charging  stations  will  be  located  in  available  public  spaces;  with  EESL  entering  into \nmemorandums of understanding with municipal and/or other public agencies to use such spaces. \nReplacing  old  meters  with  new  smart  meters  will  require  resettlement.  The  project  will  have  no \nnegative impacts on titled or non-titled holders or their livelihoods. A resettlement framework has been \nprepared by EESL that details involuntary resettlement screening procedures and contains checklists \nfor subproject selection and implementation and to ensure that all future sites for solar infrastructure \nare within existing substation areas and free of encumbrances. It also contains due diligence reports \nof  sample  subprojects  to  ensure  that  the  project  will  not  cause  negative  involuntary  resettlement \nimpacts. EESL and ADB conducted stakeholder consultations and documented them in due diligence \nreports,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  loan  agreement  will \ninclude assurances related to social safeguards, core labor standards for contractors (including equal \npay for equal types of work), and HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevention.  \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  activities  will  not  negatively  impact \n41. \nindigenous  peoples  or  their  livelihoods.  The  project  outcome\u2014to  increase  end-use  energy \nefficiency\u2014will  produce  positive  socioeconomic  impacts  in  the  project  area.  The  resettlement \nframework  (para.  41)  includes  indigenous  people\u2019s  checklists,  and  due  diligence  reports  for  the \nsample subprojects to ensure that the project will not negatively impact indigenous peoples.
