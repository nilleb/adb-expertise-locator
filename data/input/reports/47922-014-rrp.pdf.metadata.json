Investing  in  human  capital  brings  about  powerful  social  change  and  creates \nopportunities for  children  to  realize  their full  potential.  Primary  education is  the  most  important \nlevel of education because it lays the foundation for all future formal learning, and without it this \nadditional education and the benefits it can bring cannot be achieved. With an enrollment rate of \n96%, India has significantly increased access to primary education, but its public primary school \nsystem  is  beset  by  problems.  The  quality  of  the  teaching  is  poor,  teachers  have  high  rates  of \nabsenteeism,  and  the  system  is  unable  to  provide  students  with  individual  attention.  These \nproblems  result  in  poor  learning  outcomes  in  primary  school,  which  leave  students  who  reach \nsecondary school unprepared for the rigor and demands of education there. Many simply drop \nout.  The  ills  of  India\u2019s  public  education  system  are  felt  most  acutely  by  the  country\u2019s  poor, \nespecially in rural areas where the majority of the children attend government-run schools.  The \nlearning deficit afflicting rural India\u2019s children urgently needs to be addressed.  \n \nIdentifying a private sector investment opportunity in education that is both commercially \n3. \nsustainable and has the strong development characteristics needed to help resolve this problem \nis challenging, given the unique market dynamics of the sector. Based on discussions with HLC, \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  believes  that  the  company  offers  an  affordable,  low-cost, \nand commercially sustainable supplementary education solution that can improve poor learning \noutcomes  for  children  in  rural  India.  Moreover,  the  company\u2019s  successful  initial  roll-out  of \neducation  centers  in  rural  parts  of  Karnataka  demonstrates  strong  market  demand  for  this \nservice. ADB\u2019s investment will enable the company to expand its operations. At the same time, \nADB\u2019s  knowledge  and  experience  will  be  valuable  to  the  company  as  it  scales  up  its  inclusive \nbusiness  model.  The  low-cost  supplementary  education  solution  developed  by  HLC  has  good \npotential  for  replication  in  other  states  in  India,  as  well  as  in  other  ADB  developing  member \ncountries. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n4. \nIndia\u2019s annual status of education report (ASER) for 2012 highlighted a steep decline in \nstudent  learning  outcomes  in  rural  India  from  levels  that  were  already  low  in  2010.1 In  just  2 \nyears, the percentage of rural grade 5 students who could read a grade 2 level text had declined \nfrom 53.7% to 46.8%.2 The percentage of grade 5 students in rural India who can solve a simple \ngrade  2  level  two-digit  subtraction  problem  had  dropped  from  70.9%  in  2010  to  61%  in  2012. \nThe ASER showed that most students in rural India today are at least three grade levels behind \nwhere they should be at their age. Learning deficits from primary school will lead to substandard \n\n                                                 \n1  ASER is the largest annual household survey of children in rural India. It focuses on the status of schooling and \nbasic learning.  The 2012 ASER covered 567 districts, 16,000 villages, 14,600 government schools, and 600,000 \nchildren aged 3\u201316. The survey is conducted by Pratham, a leading nongovernment organization. \n\n2  ASER Centre, Pratham Education Foundation. 2013. Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) 2012. New Delhi. \n\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nlearning  outcomes  in  secondary  school.  The  problem  has  serious  implications  for  equity  and \neconomic growth in India. \n \n5. \nAlthough some form of paid supplementary after-school education from private tutors is \nwidely  available  in  urban  areas,  only  23%  of  India\u2019s  rural  students  benefit  from  it.  The  2012 \nASER  showed  clearly  that  children  who  receive  this  additional  support  have  better  learning \noutcomes than those who do not. The learning deficit in rural areas is further exacerbated by the \nlack  of  preschools,  which  have  proliferated  in  urban  areas.  The  public  school  system  in  rural \nIndia  begins  at grade  1. Only  rich rural  households  can  afford to send their  children  to  private \npreschools  in  nearby  urban  centers. This  means  that  most rural  children  have  no  exposure  to \nformal  development  of  literacy  or  cognitive  skills  until  they  enroll  in  grade  1  at  5  or  6  years of \nage.  In  terms  of  cognitive  and  social  ability,  this  puts  them  at  a  significant  disadvantage, \ncompared with children in urban areas.  \n \n6. \nHLC  is  pioneering  an  affordable  supplementary  education  system  for  children  in  rural \nparts  of  Karnataka  that  focuses  on  improving  learning  outcomes.  The  104  education  centers \nowned  and  operated  by  HLC  in  2013  offered  kindergarten  and  after-school  programs  for \nchildren  aged  3\u201311  years  of  age.  Each  center  is  run  by  a  female  teacher  from  the  local \ncommunity.  HLC  centers  operate  for  6  hours  per  day,  5  days  a  week,  10  months  a  year. \nCenters typically offer pre-kindergarten, lower kindergarten, and upper kindergarten programs in \nthe  morning,  as  well  as  after\u2013school  learning  programs  in  the  English  language  and \nmathematics  in  the  evening.  HLC  also  operates  its  kindergarten  programs  on  a  management \ncontract basis in rural public and private schools. Under these partnerships, the HLC programs \nare  delivered  via  the  existing  infrastructure  of  the  partner  schools.  HLC  trains  the  teachers, \nprovides teacher session plans, and student materials. In return, HLC receives a license fee, a \nteacher training fee on a per teacher basis, and student fees on a per child basis. In 2013, HLC \npartnered with two schools in Karnataka under such arrangements. \n \n7. \n \n8. \nHLC recruits teachers from the villages where the education centers are to be located. \nThis  helps  promote  regular  attendance  by  the  children,  retain  teachers,  and  build  trust  in  the \ncommunity.   \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nThe prominent feature of the teaching methodology in the curriculum HLC has devised is \n9. \na move away from rote learning to learning with comprehension. It is based on a wide review of \ncurricula  and  adopts  a  strong  child-centered  approach  that  helps  children  to  progress  up  a \nlearning ladder irrespective of their age. The goal of the HLC kindergarten program is to provide \na  child-centered  environment  and  experiences  to  equip  the  child  with  age-appropriate  skills \nrequired for entry to grade 1 and the formal education system. HLC\u2019s curriculum achieves this \nby  fostering  physical  and  motor  development,  language  development,  cognitive  development, \nsocio-emotional development, and creative expression.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n10. \n \n11. \nLearning  assessment.  HLC  assesses  children  monthly.  These  assessments  are \ncarried  out  in  a  stress-free  and  friendly  manner.  The  assessments  are  based  on  the  learning \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n\f3 \n\noutcome  for  that  month.  HLC  uses  a  grading  system  to  track,  communicate,  and  analyze  a \nchild\u2019s  performance  on four  levels\u2014starter, tentative,  excellence  and  par-excellence.  HLC  has \ndesigned  trackers  to  help  the  teacher  enter  the  assessment  grades,  analyze  performance, \nidentify learners at different learning levels, and provide the required individualized attention. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n\n \nStarting 2015, HLC also intends to partner with schools under a licensing arrangement in \n12. \nareas where it does not necessarily operate its own centers. HLC will receive a license fee from \nthe schools for use of its teaching materials and learning assessment templates. However, HLC \nwill not be involved in day-to-day operations of the kindergartens and after-school programs in \nthese schools.  \n \n13. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\nHLC  is  a  venture  capital-backed  company  established  in  2010  by  Umesh  Malhotra,  an \n14. \ninformation technology entrepreneur with more than 10 years of experience in child education in \nIndia.  HLC  is  incorporated  in  India  and  headquartered  in  Bangalore.  In  2012,  three  venture \ncapital investors\u2014Acumen Fund, Lok Capital and Unitus Seed Fund\u2014invested Rs40 million in \nHLC, taking a minority stake in the company. Acumen Fund is a global venture fund that invests \nin entrepreneurial approaches to solving the problem of poverty. As of December 2012, the fund \nhad  invested  $83  million  in  73  enterprises  in  10 countries.

The economic analysis justified the project based on specific criteria \nused for the socio-economic justification of education projects. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n20. \n \n21. \nReporting  arrangements.  HLC  will  provide  unaudited  quarterly  financial  statements \nand  audited  annual  financial  statements  to  ADB.  ADB  will  monitor  the  investment  using \ninformation  from  HLC,  investment  administration  missions,  site  visits,  and  the  public  domain. \nThe  investment  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  its financial  success,  operating  performance, \nand achievement of the development objectives. The performance indicators are included in the \ndesign and monitoring framework.  \n \nD. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n22. \n\nThe proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n\n\f5 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADB\u2019s assistance will provide much-needed growth capital to a company with an \ninnovative education service delivery model to scale up its operations. \nADB\u2019s  investment  will  enable  the  company  to  raise  capital  from  other  private \nequity firms in the next 5 years. \nThrough ADB\u2019s representation on its board of directors, the company will benefit \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  in  the  sector  as  it  scales  up  operations  and  develops \nfurther education solutions.  \n\n \nRisks \n\nE. \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\n23. \nAbility  to  train  and  retain  qualified  staff.  HLC  needs  to  build  up  its  overall \norganizational capacity to achieve its planned rapid scale-up.  Its ability to find, train, and retain \nqualified staff within the local communities will be crucial to maintaining quality in its educational \nservices  and  maintaining  the  company\u2019s  pace  of  growth.  The  biggest  obstacle  faced  by  HLC \nhas been a shortage of competent, skilled teachers. \n \nKey  person  risk. The founder,  Umesh  Malhotra,  has  played  a critical role  in  the  rapid \n24. \ngrowth of the company with his own investment commitment, keen entrepreneurial skills, good \nbusiness  network,  strong  management  and  operational  skills,  and  in-depth  knowledge  of  the \nrural  education  landscape  in  India.  The  successful  execution  of  HLC\u2019s  expansion  plan  will \ndepend largely on him, which exposes the company to significant key person risk.  \n \n25. \n \nExecution  risk. The successful execution of HLC\u2019s aggressive business plan depends \n26. \non  the  company\u2019s  ability  to  manage  operational  risks,  primarily  the  ability  to  recruit  and  retain \nqualified staff, the key person risk, and the regulatory risk.  \n \n27.  Willingness  to  pay.

The  Indian  primary  education  system  has  struggled  to  offer  good  quality \n31. \neducation, particularly to children in rural areas. While primary school enrolment rates are now \nat  96%,  the quality  of  instruction  is  often  low  and focuses more  on rote memorization  than  on \nreal  learning.  This  has  resulted  in  poor  learning  outcomes,  as  indicated  by  the  2012  ASER \nsurvey.  Rural  India  currently  faces  a  severe  shortage  of  quality  kindergarten  and  afterschool \nsupplementary education providers that can effectively prepare students to succeed in primary \nschool.  The  envisaged  impacts  of  the  project  are:  (i)  improved  learning  outcomes  for  primary \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6  \n \n\n \n\nOutcome. The project will increase access to good quality kindergarten and after-school \n\nstudents  in  the  rural  parts  of  Karnataka  and  Tamil  Nadu  states,  and  (ii)  increased  private \ninvestment in kindergarten and primary education services in India. \n \n32. \nprograms for children aged 3 to 11 years in rural regions of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states. \n \n33. \nOutputs.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  result  in  setting  up  702  rural \neducation centers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by 2016 for provision of kindergarten and after-\nschool programs. In addition to its own education centers, HLC will also establish partnerships \nwith 268 schools by 2016 to offer kindergarten and after-school programs under a management \ncontract  or  a  licensing  arrangement. The  project  will  also  provide  training  and  employment for \n2,615 women in rural Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and deliver gender-sensitive learning.  \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nThe  investment  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020.4 Under  its  strategic  agenda  of \n34. \ninclusive  economic  growth,  ADB  is  committed  to  supporting  investments  in  education,  which \nparticularly benefit the poor and women. The project is also consistent with the ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  India  for  2013\u20132017,  which  calls  for  support  for  education  activities.5 \nGender  equity  is  one  of  the  five  drivers  of  change  identified  in  Strategy  2020.  As  per  its \nEducation  by  2020:  A  Sector Operations  Plan, ADB  is  committed  to  using  new  and  innovative \nmodels  of  service  delivery  and  financing  in  the  education  sector,  with  the  aim  of  making  the \nsector attractive for private investments.6 The investment is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Gender \nEquality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment  Operational  Plan,  2013\u20132020. 7 It  encourages  gender \nmainstreaming in nonsovereign operations and, among other things, supports private initiatives \nthat help women find employment and become entrepreneurs. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\n35. \nThe investment is category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples.  No  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  is  anticipated.  HLC  leases  existing  facilities \nwithin villages and does not construct its learning centers. HLC will help ensure that all learning \ncenters  have  sanitary  toilet  facilities  and  water  supply  and  implement  appropriate  waste \nmanagement practices. The project will not involve involuntary acquisition or purchase of land. \nNor will it entail any physical or economic displacement.  Lease agreements will be signed with \nowners  of  existing  properties  that  are  determined  suitable  for  HLC  operations.  Only  a  small \npercentage of the populations of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states, where HLC will operate its \neducation  centers,  are  members  of  India\u2019s  scheduled  tribes.

The decision to train and recruit local women as teachers to run \nthe education centers also has commercial benefits. Female teachers have been shown to have \nlower  rates  of  absenteeism  than  male  teachers.  The  investment  is  categorized  as  effective \ngender  mainstreaming.
