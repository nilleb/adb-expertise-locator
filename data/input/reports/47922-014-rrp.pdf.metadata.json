I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $2,000,000 (or in Indian rupee equivalent) in Hippocampus Learning \nCentres (HLC) for the Rural Education Project in India. \n \nII.  THE COMPANY  \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Education  is  key  to  building  a  society  that  can  overcome  poverty  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.  Investing  in  human  capital  brings  about  powerful  social  change  and  creates \nopportunities for children to realize their full potential. Primary education is the most important \nlevel of education because it lays the foundation for all future formal learning, and without it this \nadditional education and the benefits it can bring cannot be achieved. With an enrollment rate of \n96%, India has significantly increased access to primary education, but its public primary school \nsystem is beset by problems. The quality of the teaching is poor, teachers have high rates of \nabsenteeism, and the system is unable to provide students with individual attention. These \nproblems result in poor learning outcomes in primary school, which leave students who reach \nsecondary school unprepared for the rigor and demands of education there. Many simply drop \nout. The ills of India\u2019s public education system are felt most acutely by the country\u2019s poor, \nespecially in rural areas where the majority of the children attend government-run schools.  The \nlearning deficit afflicting rural India\u2019s children urgently needs to be addressed.  \n \n3.  Identifying a private sector investment opportunity in education that is both commercially \nsustainable and has the strong development characteristics needed to help resolve this problem \nis challenging, given the unique market dynamics of the sector. Based on discussions with HLC, \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) believes that the company offers an affordable, low-cost, \nand commercially sustainable supplementary education solution that can improve poor learning \noutcomes  for  children  in  rural  India.  Moreover,  the  company\u2019s  successful  initial  roll-out  of \neducation centers in rural parts of Karnataka demonstrates strong market demand for this \nservice. ADB\u2019s investment will enable the company to expand its operations. At the same time, \nADB\u2019s knowledge and experience will be valuable to the company as it scales up its inclusive \nbusiness model. The low-cost supplementary education solution developed by HLC has good \npotential for replication in other states in India, as well as in other ADB developing member \ncountries. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n4.  India\u2019s annual status of education report (ASER) for 2012 highlighted a steep decline in \nstudent learning outcomes in rural India from levels that were already low in 2010.1 In just 2 \nyears, the percentage of rural grade 5 students who could read a grade 2 level text had declined \nfrom 53.7% to 46.8%.2 The percentage of grade 5 students in rural India who can solve a simple \ngrade 2 level two-digit subtraction problem had dropped from 70.9% in 2010 to 61% in 2012. \nThe ASER showed that most students in rural India today are at least three grade levels behind \nwhere they should be at their age. Learning deficits from primary school will lead to substandard \n                                                \n1  ASER is the largest annual household survey of children in rural India. It focuses on the status of schooling and \nbasic learning.  The 2012 ASER covered 567 districts, 16,000 villages, 14,600 government schools, and 600,000 \nchildren aged 3\u201316. The survey is conducted by Pratham, a leading nongovernment organization. \n2  ASER Centre, Pratham Education Foundation. 2013. Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) 2012. New Delhi. \n ", "2    \n \nlearning outcomes in secondary school. The problem has serious implications for equity and \neconomic growth in India. \n \n5.  Although some form of paid supplementary after-school education from private tutors is \nwidely available in urban areas, only 23% of India\u2019s rural students benefit from it. The 2012 \nASER showed clearly that children who receive this additional support have better learning \noutcomes than those who do not. The learning deficit in rural areas is further exacerbated by the \nlack of preschools, which have proliferated in urban areas. The public school system in rural \nIndia begins at grade 1. Only rich rural households can afford to send their children to private \npreschools in nearby urban centers. This means that most rural children have no exposure to \nformal development of literacy or cognitive skills until they enroll in grade 1 at 5 or 6 years of \nage. In terms  of  cognitive  and  social  ability,  this  puts  them  at  a significant  disadvantage, \ncompared with children in urban areas.  \n \n6.  HLC is pioneering an affordable supplementary education system for children in rural \nparts of Karnataka that focuses on improving learning outcomes. The 104 education centers \nowned  and  operated  by  HLC  in  2013  offered  kindergarten  and  after-school  programs  for \nchildren  aged  3\u201311  years  of  age.  Each center  is run  by a female teacher from the  local \ncommunity. HLC centers operate for 6 hours per day, 5 days a week, 10 months a year. \nCenters typically offer pre-kindergarten, lower kindergarten, and upper kindergarten programs in \nthe  morning,  as  well  as  after\u2013school  learning  programs  in  the  English  language  and \nmathematics in the evening. HLC also operates its kindergarten programs on a management \ncontract basis in rural public and private schools. Under these partnerships, the HLC programs \nare delivered via the existing infrastructure of the partner schools. HLC trains the teachers, \nprovides teacher session plans, and student materials. In return, HLC receives a license fee, a \nteacher training fee on a per teacher basis, and student fees on a per child basis. In 2013, HLC \npartnered with two schools in Karnataka under such arrangements. \n \n7.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n8.  HLC recruits teachers from the villages where the education centers are to be located. \nThis helps promote regular attendance by the children, retain teachers, and build trust in the \ncommunity.   \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n9.  The prominent feature of the teaching methodology in the curriculum HLC has devised is \na move away from rote learning to learning with comprehension. It is based on a wide review of \ncurricula and adopts a strong child-centered approach that helps children to progress up a \nlearning ladder irrespective of their age. The goal of the HLC kindergarten program is to provide \na child-centered environment and experiences to equip the child with age-appropriate skills \nrequired for entry to grade 1 and the formal education system. HLC\u2019s curriculum achieves this \nby fostering physical and motor development, language development, cognitive development, \nsocio-emotional development, and creative expression.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n10.

The assessments are based on the learning ", "  3 \noutcome for that month. HLC uses a grading system to track, communicate, and analyze a \nchild\u2019s performance on four levels\u2014starter, tentative, excellence and par-excellence. HLC has \ndesigned trackers to help the teacher enter the assessment grades, analyze performance, \nidentify learners at different learning levels, and provide the required individualized attention. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n \n12.  Starting 2015, HLC also intends to partner with schools under a licensing arrangement in \nareas where it does not necessarily operate its own centers. HLC will receive a license fee from \nthe schools for use of its teaching materials and learning assessment templates. However, HLC \nwill not be involved in day-to-day operations of the kindergartens and after-school programs in \nthese schools.  \n \n13.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nC.

The ADB equity investment in HLC of up $2 million, or the equivalent in Indian rupees, \nwill be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nB.  Financial and Economic Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n19.  A discounted cash flow-based financial model was used to determine the pre-money \nvaluation of the company. The economic analysis justified the project based on specific criteria \nused for the socio-economic justification of education projects. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n21.  Reporting  arrangements.  HLC will provide unaudited quarterly financial statements \nand  audited  annual  financial  statements  to  ADB.  ADB  will  monitor  the  investment  using \ninformation from HLC, investment administration missions, site visits, and the public domain. \nThe investment will be evaluated on the basis of its financial success, operating performance, \nand achievement of the development objectives. The performance indicators are included in the \ndesign and monitoring framework.  \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: ", "  5 \n(i)  ADB\u2019s assistance will provide much-needed growth capital to a company with an \ninnovative education service delivery model to scale up its operations. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s investment will enable the company to raise capital from other private \nequity firms in the next 5 years. \n(iii)  Through ADB\u2019s representation on its board of directors, the company will benefit \nfrom ADB\u2019s knowledge in the sector as it scales up operations and develops \nfurther education solutions.  \n \nE.  Risks \n23.  Ability  to  train  and  retain  qualified  staff.  HLC  needs  to  build  up  its  overall \norganizational capacity to achieve its planned rapid scale-up.  Its ability to find, train, and retain \nqualified staff within the local communities will be crucial to maintaining quality in its educational \nservices and maintaining the company\u2019s pace of growth. The biggest obstacle faced by HLC \nhas been a shortage of competent, skilled teachers. \n \n24.  Key person risk. The founder, Umesh Malhotra, has played a critical role in the rapid \ngrowth of the company with his own investment commitment, keen entrepreneurial skills, good \nbusiness network, strong management and operational skills, and in-depth knowledge of the \nrural education landscape in India. The successful  execution of HLC\u2019s expansion plan will \ndepend largely on him, which exposes the company to significant key person risk.  \n \n25.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n26.  Execution risk. The successful execution of HLC\u2019s aggressive business plan depends \non the company\u2019s ability to manage operational risks, primarily the ability to recruit and retain \nqualified staff, the key person risk, and the regulatory risk.  \n \n27.  Willingness to pay. The majority of HLC\u2019s target consumers belong to low-income \nhouseholds in rural areas.  \n \n28.  Partnerships. HLC\u2019s ability to develop partnerships with public and private schools in \nrural areas is critical to its indirect business strategy. \n \nConfidential information deleted.   \n \n29.

The  Indian  primary  education  system  has  struggled  to  offer  good  quality \neducation, particularly to children in rural areas. While primary school enrolment rates are now \nat 96%, the quality of instruction is often low and focuses more on rote memorization than on \nreal learning. This has resulted in poor learning outcomes, as indicated by the 2012 ASER \nsurvey. Rural India currently faces a severe shortage of quality kindergarten and afterschool \nsupplementary education providers that can effectively prepare students to succeed in primary \nschool. The envisaged impacts of the project are: (i) improved learning outcomes for primary \n ", "6    \n \nstudents in the rural parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states, and (ii) increased private \ninvestment in kindergarten and primary education services in India. \n \n32.  Outcome. The project will increase access to good quality kindergarten and after-school \nprograms for children aged 3 to 11 years in rural regions of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states. \n \n33.  Outputs. Successful implementation of the project will result in setting up 702 rural \neducation centers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by 2016 for provision of kindergarten and after-\nschool programs. In addition to its own education centers, HLC will also establish partnerships \nwith 268 schools by 2016 to offer kindergarten and after-school programs under a management \ncontract or a licensing arrangement. The project will also provide training and employment for \n2,615 women in rural Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and deliver gender-sensitive learning.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n34.  The investment is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020.4 Under its strategic agenda of \ninclusive economic growth, ADB is committed to supporting investments in education, which \nparticularly benefit the poor and women. The project is also consistent with the ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for India for 2013\u20132017, which calls for support for education activities.5 \nGender equity is one of the five drivers of change  identified in Strategy 2020. As per its \nEducation by 2020: A Sector Operations Plan, ADB is committed to using new and innovative \nmodels of service delivery and financing in the education sector, with the aim of making the \nsector attractive for private investments.6 The investment is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Gender \nEquality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan,  2013\u20132020.7 It encourages gender \nmainstreaming in nonsovereign operations and, among other things, supports private initiatives \nthat help women find employment and become entrepreneurs. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n35.  The investment is category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. No adverse impact on the environment is anticipated. HLC leases existing facilities \nwithin villages and does not construct its learning centers. HLC will help ensure that all learning \ncenters  have  sanitary  toilet  facilities  and  water  supply  and  implement  appropriate  waste \nmanagement practices. The project will not involve involuntary acquisition or purchase of land. \nNor will it entail any physical or economic displacement.  Lease agreements will be signed with \nowners of existing properties that are determined suitable for HLC operations. Only a small \npercentage of the populations of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states, where HLC will operate its \neducation  centers,  are  members  of  India\u2019s  scheduled  tribes.  HLC  neither  promotes  nor \ndiscriminates against the participation of children from scheduled tribes in its education centers. \nHLC will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list and ensure that it abides by applicable \nnational laws and regulations and complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).8   \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

HLC employs women from local communities to teach and operate its learning centers.  \nIts selection method addresses the mobility constraints of local women who have very limited \nincome options in rural villages. The decision to train and recruit local women as teachers to run \nthe education centers also has commercial benefits. Female teachers have been shown to have \nlower rates of absenteeism than male teachers. The investment is categorized as effective \ngender mainstreaming. HLC has agreed to take efforts to implement a gender action plan to \npromote  gender  equity  across  its  operations.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment \ndocumentation includes provisions requiring HLC to comply with national labor laws and to take \nspecific measures in relation to the relevant internationally recognized core labor standards, in \ncompliance with ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001).  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n37.  HLC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and policy \nof  relating  to  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire HLS to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money \nlaundering activities and the financing of terrorism and to covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities.   \n \nC.

Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 9  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to HLC. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $2,000,000 (or in Indian rupee equivalent) in Hippocampus Learning \nCentres for the Rural Education Project in India, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n18 March 2014\n                                                \n9  ADB. 1966.
