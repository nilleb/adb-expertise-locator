The  project  will  install,  for  the  first  time, \ncomputerized systems to improve operational efficiency and reduce losses in the transmission \nand  distribution  systems.  Such  computerized  systems  will  be  introduced  as  a first step  toward \ndigitizing power system management in Myanmar.1 The project will help increase the electricity \nsupply in support of inclusive and sustainable development and achieve the country\u2019s target of \nuniversal electricity access by 2030. It is included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u2013\n2019 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Myanmar.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nthe \n\nRationale \n\ninternational  community \n\ninitiating  wide-ranging  reforms \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDecades of isolation and internal conflicts left Myanmar one of the poorest countries in \nAsia. In 2010, 37.5% of the 52 million population lived below the poverty line.3 In 2012, Myanmar \nre-engaged  with \nincluding \ndemocratization,  macro-economic  policy  adjustments  and  structural  reforms.  Since  then,  the \neconomy grew steadily at more than 7% GDP growth per year, peaking at 8.4% in 2014,4 and \npoverty declined to 26.1% by 2015 (footnote 3). Much of Myanmar\u2019s economic growth has been \npowered by the private sector. However, according to the World Bank Doing Business survey, \nMyanmar  is  ranked  151  out  of  190  countries  and  lowest  among  the  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian Nations in terms of adequacy of electricity services.5 Moreover, continued internal conflicts \nremain a significant challenge for Myanmar\u2019s development, and consistent efforts are required to \nresolve  the  long-standing  conflicts.  The  project  aims  to  provide  one  of  the  most  critical  public \nservices as a means of economic development and conflict resolution. \n \nMyanmar  has  one  of  the  lowest  electrification  rates  in  Asia,  with  only  35%  of  the \n4. \nhouseholds having access to electricity in 2016, and with wide rural and urban disparity. While \nelectrification rates were 78% in Yangon, rural areas were significantly lower, with the lowest rates \nin Tanintharyi (9%), Rakhine (13%), Ayeyarwady (14%) and Kayin (16%).6 Moreover, these are \nsome of the poorest areas within the country. Given the severe lack of electricity in these areas, \nthe  economic  and  social  development  divide  with  urban  areas  persists,  notably  for  business \ndevelopment and the provision of basic services such as health care and education. \n \nThe  government  has  recognized  the  need  to  prioritize  rural  and  underserved  areas  to \n5. \npromote economic opportunities for all as well as peace and stability. In response, the Myanmar \n\n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Power \n\nNetwork Development Project (TA 9179). \n\n2  ADB. 2016.

Washington DC. \n6  2017 data from Electricity Supply Enterprise, Ministry of Electricity and Energy, Government of Myanmar. \n \n\n\fSustainable  Development  Strategy7  prioritizes;  (i)  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to  support \neconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (ii)  universal  electricity  access  by  2030. \nHowever, to meet this goal, the government must solve the power industry\u2019s core development \nproblems:  lack  of  generating  capacity  and  an  insufficient  and  obsolete  transmission  and \ndistribution infrastructure.  \n \n6. \nGovernment response. The government has initiated policy and institutional reforms to \nimprove the efficiency of investment, operation, and management of the power sector and has \nmobilized  resources  to  upgrade  and  expand  power  infrastructure.8  Its  long-term  power \ndevelopment plans include (i) rehabilitating and constructing power plants to increase generating \ncapacity;  (ii)  expanding  and  upgrading  the  transmission  network  to  remove  transmission \nconstraints; and (iii) expanding distribution systems to connect more consumers to the electricity \ngrid, particularly in underserved rural areas.9 \n \n7. \nInvestment  requirement.  To  meet  the  $35  billion\u2013$40  billion  required  for  the  National \nElectricity Master Plan, the government mobilizes private investment for power generation where \nmore  competition  is  desirable.  It  will  develop  the  transmission  network  through  public  finance, \nconsidering economies of scale and the capacity to enable open access to generating sources. \nAlso, the government has started corporatizing the large distribution utilities to encourage their \nfinancial autonomy. \n \n8. \nGeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution.  The  private  sector  has  responded \npositively  to  investing  in  power  generation.10  Development  partners  have  also  funded  the \nrehabilitation of aging plants and financed new ones.11 While these projects reduce immediate \nsupply constraints, more generating capacity is needed to meet rising demand, requiring about \n$20 billion in investment. The transmission network needs urgent rehabilitation and expansion to \n(i) connect the increasing generation capacity in the north with the major demand in central and \nsouthern Myanmar; and (ii) reduce transmission and distribution losses, which average 6%\u20138% \nfor transmission (as high as 20% in some regions) and 13% for distribution. Transmission network \ndevelopment  requires  about  $7  billion;  distribution  system  upgrading,  and  expansion  requires \nabout $10 billion. \n \nPolicy reforms. Support from ADB, JICA, the World Bank, and others has enabled the \n9. \ngovernment to implement policy and institutional reforms. These include creating a transparent \nmechanism  for  setting  cost-reflected  electricity  tariffs,  establishing  an  independent  regulatory \nbody  to  mobilize  private  investment,  and  corporatizing  electricity  supply  entities  to  increase \nefficiency. \n \n\n                                                \n7  Government of Myanmar. 2018. Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan. Unpublished. \n8  Government of Myanmar. 2013. Myanmar Energy Policy 2013. Unpublished. \n9  The  government  prepared  its  (i)  National  Electricity  Master  Plan,  updated  since  2017,  with  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  support;  (ii)  the  National  Electrification  Plan  with  World  Bank  support,  and  (iii)  the \nMyanmar Energy Master Plan with ADB support (ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of \nMyanmar for Enhancing the Power Sector\u2019s Legal and Regulatory Framework. Manila [TA 8469]). \n\n10 The private sector has submitted numerous proposals for hydro, solar, and thermal power plants. In 2018, the MOEE \n\nissued notices to proceed to six privately financed generation projects totaling more than 4,000 MW. \n\n11 Those  projects  include  (i)  the MOEE\u2019s  addition  of  new  hydropower  plants  and  gas-fired  plants;  (ii) JICA-assisted \nrehabilitation of gas-fired plants in Yangon ($140 million loan) and Thilawa ($100 million loan) and the Baluchaung \nhydropower plant ($70 million grant); (iii) the World Bank Group-assisted Thaton gas-fired plant ($140 million loan); \nand (iv) the ADB-supported nonsovereign Myingyan power plant (ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and Guarantee for the Myingyan Natural Gas Power Project in \nMyanmar. Manila [Loan 3359]). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. Since 2012, ADB has provided $4.7 million in technical \n10. \nassistance to help (i) prepare the Electricity Law (2014) and the energy master plan and (ii) draft \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency policies.12 ADB has also provided (i) $140 million from \nthe Asian Development Fund to upgrade electricity infrastructure, and (ii) a private sector loan of \n$152.2 million plus a political risk guarantee for a high-efficiency combined-cycle gas-fired power \nplant.13 ADB\u2019s timely and targeted assistance added value by addressing the most urgent needs, \nincluding policy and institutional development, capacity building, and investment. Lessons learned \nfrom  previous  assistance  confirm  that  aligning  project  design  with  government  plans,  close \ncooperation with the MOEE in project execution, and hands-on capacity building would make ADB \nassistance relevant and effective. \n \n11. \nADB has adopted a conflict sensitive approach to ensure that ADB assistance (i) will not \nexacerbate  ongoing  conflicts,  (ii)  contributes  to  Myanmar\u2019s  inclusive  development,  ensuring \nequitable benefit to all communities, and (iii) will not be disrupted by local conflicts. To achieve \nthis, ADB project design includes measures to ensure that project affected people are properly \ninformed  about  the  project,  involved  in  project  decision  making,  particularly  with  respect  to \ncompensation for adverse impacts, and have equal opportunity to participate in, and obtain project \nbenefits. Such measures include a stakeholder communication strategy and implementation plan, \narticulated  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM),14  resettlement  and  ethnic  development \nplans, and proper implementation and monitoring of these plans.15 The conflict sensitive approach \ndesigned for the project will be applied specifically for the three conflict affected states: Kayin, \nMon, and Rakhine, where the project will build distribution facilities to support rural electrification \nin these areas (para. 14). The Summary of Project Activities in Conflict-Affected Areas contains \nfurther information on these subprojects.16   \n \n12. \nDevelopment  coordination.  ADB,  JICA,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development \npartners  closely  coordinate  their  assistance  for  the  power  sector  in  Myanmar,  through  active \nparticipation in the Sector Coordination Group, chaired by the MOEE union minister. Guided by \nthe Myanmar Development Assistance Policy,17 Sector Coordination Group meetings discuss and \nprioritize areas for assistance, review implementation challenges, and propose actions to ensure \nefficient use of international assistance for the sector.18 As a result, ADB focuses its assistance \non strengthening the 230 kV transmission system and the 66 kV, 33 kV, and 11 kV distribution \n\n                                                \n12 ADB technical assistance and grants covered (i) capacity building and institution support; (ii) policy, strategy, master \nplan, legal,  and  regulatory  framework  development;  (iii)  off-grid  renewable  energy  demonstration;  (iv)  investment \nproject feasibility study; (v) financial management assessment of the energy sector; (vi) country safeguard system \nstrengthening; and (vii) public\u2013private partnership framework development. \n\n13 ADB. 2013.

Myanmar Development Assistance Policy. Nay \n\n18 The Myanmar Development Assistance Policy established the Power Sector Coordination Group in 2017. ADB, JICA, \nand  the World  Bank co-lead  the  group,  which includes  other  development partners  from France,  Germany,  Italy, \nNorway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nsystems; JICA will finance the 500 kV backbone and the rehabilitation of the Yangon distribution \nsystem; and the World Bank will support on-grid and off-grid rural electrification and tariff reform.19 \n \n13. \nProject  focus.  The  Yangon  region  is  the  center  of  business  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, accounting for 50% of the country\u2019s electricity consumption. Yangon\u2019s transmission \nsystem consists mainly of low voltage facilities, which need upgrading to a high voltage system. \nThe  ongoing  ADB-financed  Power  Transmission Improvement  Project  is upgrading  the Thida\u2013\nThaketa\u2013Kyaikasan  section  from  66  kV  to  230  kV.20  This  proposed  project  will  upgrade  the \nAhlone\u2013Thida section. Upon project completion, the Yangon power system will have a complete \n230  kV  transmission  ring,  which  will  increase  transmission  capacity  and  reliability  and  reduce \ntransmission  losses.  Separately,  the  government  is  determined  to  connect  Tanintharyi\u2014the \ncountry\u2019s southernmost region and the only region without a transmission system\u2014to the national \ntransmission network. The proposed Mawlamyine\u2013Ye\u2013Dawei 230 kV transmission line is the first \nstep toward realizing this vision. \n \n14. \nIn  parallel  with  developing  the  transmission  network,  the  government  needs  to  expand \ndistribution systems to achieve universal electrification by 2030. The proposed strengthening and \nexpansion of distribution systems in the Ayeyarwady and Bago regions and in Kayin, Mon, and \nRakhine states directly contribute to achieving this target. These regions and states have poverty \nrates higher than the national average and electrification rates below the 35% national average. \nCurrently, poverty rates are 45% in Ayeyarwady, 30% in Bago, 41% in Kayin, 53% in Mon, and \n78% in Rakhine21 and electrification rates are 14% in Ayeyarwady, 31% in Bago, 16% in Kayin, \n38% in Mon, and 13% in Rakhine (footnote 6). The project is expected to enable the government \nto electrify an additional 330,000 households in more than 2,000 villages, doubling the average \nelectrification  rate  in  the  project  areas  from  28%  to  56%  by  2026.  Additionally,  1,400  schools, \nclinics, hospitals, and libraries will gain access to grid electricity. The project will install, for the \nfirst time, a computerized transmission asset management system and a computerized customer \nbilling  system\u2014the  first  step  toward  digitizing  power  system  management  in  Myanmar\u2014to \nimprove operational efficiency, effectively manage assets, and reduce nontechnical losses. The \nproject will build distribution subprojects in the conflict affected areas, namely in Kayin, Mon, and \nRakhine  states,  where  the  ADB  conflict  sensitive  approach  (para.  11)  will  be  implemented \n(footnote 16).  \n \n15. \nStrategy 2030 (Table 1).22 \n \n\nThe  project,  prepared  in  response  to  the  government\u2019s  request,  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n1.

Similarly,  the  computerized  billing  system  will  help  the  ESE \nimprove its revenue collection. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  assessment  followed  ADB\u2019s \n26. \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects27 by comparing societal costs and benefits of \nthe with-project scenario with the without-project scenario. The project will significantly increase \nelectricity  transmission  and  distribution  capacity, reduce  losses,  and  enhance  the  security  and \nreliability of the supply in seven central and southern regions and states of Myanmar. \n \n27. \nThe project\u2019s quantifiable benefits include increased electricity supply with higher reliability \nfor  the  Yangon  region  (3,097  gigawatt-hours  [GWh])  by  2034,  provision  of  962  GWh  of  grid \nelectricity to the Tanintharyi region by 2030 (currently the region uses diesel-based electricity), \nand  electrification  of  330,000  households  and  1,400  public  buildings  (schools,  clinics,  village \noffices) in selected ESE distribution areas in five regions and states. By 2030, the ESE\u2019s electricity \nsupply will increase by 1,981 GWh and its distribution losses will drop 2 percentage points from \n13% in 2016. The replacement of diesel and other fuels with grid electricity and the distribution \nloss reduction resulting from the project will reduce about 13.5 million tons of carbon dioxide over \n25  years.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  is  17.7%.  A  sensitivity  analysis \nconfirms the project\u2019s economic viability regarding important project variables.28 \n \n28. \nFinancial analysis. The financial evaluation of the distribution component of the project \nfollowed  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.29  The  analysis \nexamined the financial viability of the proposed reinforcement and expansion of the distribution \nnetwork owned and operated by the ESE. The transmission component will be implemented by \nthe DPTSC, a nonrevenue-generating entity. As such, the transmission component was excluded \nfrom the financial analysis. \n \nThe ESE\u2019s profitability has declined in FY2015 and FY2016 because of (i) the inadequate \n29. \ntariff margin (the difference between the buying and selling prices) set by the government; and (ii) \nthe separation of electricity distribution in Mandalay to a stand-alone entity in FY2016, resulting \nin the loss of a high-value customer base. As the ESE gears up its capital investment program to \nexpand and reinforce its network, the government needs to increase the tariff margin to allow the \nESE to generate enough cash to meet its expenditure and debt service obligations. Otherwise, \nthe government would have to continue its budgetary support, which is not sustainable. \n \nThe analysis was performed by comparing the future incremental benefits accrued from \n30. \nadditional electricity sales and the incremental costs to the ESE in real terms, discounted to their \npresent value. The post-tax financial net present value of the incremental cash flows discounted \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Manila. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nat the weighted average cost of capital is $54.7 million. The post-tax real financial internal rate of \nreturn of the project is 2.8%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 0.2%.30 \n \nC. \n \n31. \nThe  financial  management  and  sustainability  risk  is  high  mainly  because  of  three \nweaknesses: (i) the DPTSC\u2019s dependence on the MOEE\u2019s budget allocation for its operation and \ninvestment; (ii) the ESE\u2019s dependence on the tariff margin, for which a transparent mechanism \nfor  review  and  adjustment  is  still  being  developed;  and  (iii)  weaknesses  in  internal  financial \nmanagement  and  reporting. To  help  mitigate  these risks, the  project  proposes regular  reviews \nand  adjustments  of  electricity  tariffs  to  recover  costs  and  strengthening  of  the  technical  and \nfinancial performance of the ESE and the DPTSC. The long-term solution will be transformation \nof the DPTSC and ESE into independent transmission and distribution companies, which is being \nsupported through the Sector Coordination Group. \n \n32. \nThe  government  regulates  electricity  tariffs,  which  (depending  on  consumption  level) \nrange from MK35 to MK50 per kWh for residential consumers and MK75 to MK150 per kWh for \nindustrial and commercial consumers. Such low tariffs necessitate government subsidies for the \nDPTSC  and  the  ESE.  The  government  is  conducting  an  analytical  study  to  devise  a  tariff \nadjustment  mechanism  that  allows  tariffs  to  reflect  electricity  supply  costs.  The  last  retail  tariff \nincrease  in  2015  led  to  a  weighted  average  increase  of  about  40%  over  2014  tariffs.  Going \nforward, the government is implementing rules and regulations under the Electricity Law (2014) \nso that electricity tariffs will promote the efficiency and economy of the power industry, while also \nmeeting the government\u2019s poverty reduction objective through a lifeline tariff.31 \n \n33. \nThe government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nThe  Anticorruption  Law  currently  in  use  was  promulgated  in  July  2013.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with the government \nand the MOEE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe  PAM  (footnote  14).  ADB  has  organized  and  will  continue  organizing  training  for  MOEE, \nDPTSC, and ESE staff covering ADB guidelines and procedures for procurement, disbursement, \nreporting, monitoring (by ADB staff and the project implementation consultants), and prevention \nof fraud and corruption (by ADB staff). \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  helps  achieve  the  target  of  100%  household  electrification  by  2030.  The \n34. \nproject beneficiaries are households, businesses, and public institutions in the regions and states \nof  Ayeyarwady,  Bago,  Kayin,  Mon,  Rakhine,  Tanintharyi,  and  Yangon.  Under  the  distribution \ncomponent, 330,000 households and 1,400 public buildings (schools, clinics, and hospitals) will \nbe newly electrified, doubling the average electrification ratio of the concerned states and regions \nfrom  the  28%  to  56%.  Consumers  in  the  Tanintharyi  and  Yangon  regions  will  benefit  from \nelectricity  made  available  from  greater  transmission  capacity.  The  availability  of  electricity \nimproves health outcomes, increases employment and income opportunities, and improves living \nconditions  for  women  and  children.  The  application  of  the  ADB  conflict  sensitive  approach \nthroughout  project  implementation  will  ensure  that  project  affected  peoples  can  participate  in \nproject  design,  and  will  have  equal  opportunities  to  be  connected,  with  fair  and  equitable \n                                                \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 A  lifeline  tariff  is  a  targeted  subsidy  based  on  household  consumption  levels.  The  tariff  for  the  first  block  of \nconsumption\u2014equal to the basic needs of the poor\u2014is provided at a subsidized rate, while the tariff for subsequent \nblocks are cost-reflective. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\ndistribution  of  project  benefits,  without  any  bias  or  preferential  treatment  for  any  group  over \nanother (para. 11).   \n \n35. \nAlthough the project is classified no gender elements, it will give women job opportunities, \nparticularly during the construction of the distribution component. The influx of male workers at \nfuture construction sites may lead to higher risk of sexually transmitted diseases. To mitigate this \nimpact, construction contracts will include prevention and health and safety measures. In addition, \nthe environmental management plan (EMP) includes a code of conduct for workers. The PICs will \nconduct  training  sessions  and  information  campaigns  for  the  PIUs,  local  communities,  and \nworkers on gender issues, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy describes the project\u2019s social aspects.32 \n \n36.  MOEE  prepared  a  stakeholder  communication  strategy  (SCS)  in  consultation  with  the \nADB.  The  SCS  supports  two-way  and  effective  communication  and  information  sharing  with \nproject  beneficiaries,  project-affected  people,  and  other  concerned  stakeholders  (including \nwomen  and  vulnerable  groups)  throughout  the  project,  thus  facilitating  understanding  and \nacceptance of the project. The SCS includes the actions and responsibilities of the PIUs and the \nPMUs in implementing activities under the SCS. \n \nE. \n \n37. \nBased on technical due diligence and feasibility design, the implementing agencies have \nprepared  project  safeguard  documents  following  government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).33  These  include  (i)  an  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE),34  and  (ii)  a  resettlement  and  ethnic  group  development  plan  (REGDP)  for  each  project \ncomponent  (footnote  15).  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are described in paras. 38\u201345. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  IEEs  identified  the  project\u2019s  potential  environmental \n38. \nimpacts and proposed measures to mitigate them through the EMPs. The implementing agencies \nprepared  the  EMPs  in  consultation  with  the  affected  communities  and  stakeholders,  following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The IEEs found that \nthe  project  does  not  cause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  as  the  rights-of-way  of \ntransmission lines and substation locations avoid environmentally sensitive areas. The potential \nenvironmental impacts are primarily noise and dust from construction and risks to occupational \nand community health and safety, which can be mitigated and managed. Expected impacts are \nsite-specific, and the EMPs have incorporated appropriate mitigation measures. \n \n39. \nThe EMPs are part of the bidding documents. Before awarding contracts, the DPTSC and \nthe ESE will reassess the potential impacts on the environmental receptors and will make sure \nthat appropriate mitigation measures are in place. No construction work will be allowed before \nADB approves the updated IEEs, and EMPs. The IEEs, and EMPs specify a grievance redress \nmechanism and monitoring requirements. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The \n40. \nproject involves (i) permanent land acquisition for substations and tower footings of transmission \nand distribution lines and (ii) temporary impacts during the construction of the project facilities. \n\n                                                \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 The implementing agencies held 21 stakeholder consultations involving more than 1,000 participants. \n34 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nThe  permanent  and  temporary  impacts  will  affect  714  households  under  the  transmission \ncomponent and 20 households under the distribution component. \n \n41. \nThe project will permanently acquire 38 hectares of land for the distribution component \nand 1 hectare for the transmission component, which will be used for the substations and tower \nfootings. This will have a severe impact on 18 households (totaling 91 people): 9 households will \nlose  their  primary  residential  structures  under the  transmission  component; another  9  will  lose \nmore  than  10%  of  their  total  landholdings  or  income  under  the  distribution  component.  Both \ncomponents  also  involve  temporary  impacts  on  crops  and  rubber  plantations.  Crops  will  be \nremoved from the line corridor during construction and height limitations on trees within the line \ncorridor  will  be  enforced.  In  addition,  445  shops  along  the  transmission  line  alignment  will  be \ndisturbed during construction. The temporary impacts are expected to be minimal because of the \nwide use of road easements, the short construction period, and construction during the dry season \nwhen most of the farmland lies fallow. \n \n42. \nThe project has identified 117 vulnerable households, comprising 65 households headed \nby  women,  43  very  poor  households,  and  9  households  that  have  people  with  disabilities.  In \naddition  to  compensation  per  the  entitlement,  the  project  will  facilitate  their  participation  in \nlivelihood  development  activities  in  the  project  areas  to  improve  their  income  generation \nopportunities. These measures will restore the income and standard of living of the vulnerable \nhouseholds and no further income restoration program is needed. \n \n43. \nAll affected households are entitled to compensation at full replacement cost for their lost \nassets,  incomes,  and  businesses.  The  REGDPs  specify  the  implementation  arrangements, \nmonitoring  requirements,  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The  compensation  budget  is \nincluded in the project costs to be financed by the MOEE. The implementing agencies will update \nthe REGDPs based on detailed engineering design and have them approved by ADB before any \nphysical or economic displacement takes place. \n \n44. \nThree states\u2014Kayin, Mon, and Rakhine\u2014have ethnic groups living in the project areas. \nThe project will not acquire lands that are traditionally used by the ethnic groups nor cause any \nadverse impacts on the identity, society, culture, and areas of spiritual importance or interfere with \ntheir sociocultural beliefs and livelihood systems. Ethnic group communities will benefit equally \nfrom  the  project  through  job  opportunities  and  household  electrification.  The  implementing \nagencies  have  properly  consulted  the  ethnic  groups  and  will  address  their  concerns  during \nREGDP implementation. \n \n45. \nThe MOEE will recruit PICs with international and national safeguards specialists (for the \nenvironment  and  social  safeguards)  to  assist  the  PMUs  and  the  PIUs  in  updating  and \nimplementing  the  EMPs  and  REGDPs.  The  PICs  will  also  train  the  PMUs  and  the  PIUs  on \nenvironmental management and on EMP and REGDP implementation. The project implementation \ncosts incorporate the estimated budget for the implementation of the safeguard mitigation plans. \n \nF. \n \n46. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n\nThe  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f11 \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nInstability in Rakhine state \nmay prevent compliance with \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) conflict-sensitive \napproach, including project \nconsultations with all \nstakeholders and equitable \ndistribution of project benefits. \n\nThe government\u2019s multilayer \napproval requirements may \ndelay recruitment of \nconsultants and works and \ngoods contracts. \nUncertainty on timely \nmobilization of large capital \ninvestments for the expansion \nof the generating capacity and \nrural electrification. \n\nThe financial management \nand financial viability of the \nESE and the Department of \nPower Transmission and \nSystem Control are weak. \nImplementation of a \nmechanism for a full cost-\nrecovery electricity tariff is \ndelayed. \n\nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and conflict-sensitive \napproach, the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) and the government \nhave agreed to the following specific assurances and conditions in the loan \nagreement: the state and regional governments, the MOEE, and the Electricity \nSupply Enterprise (ESE), at all levels, will make sure that (i) all households and \ncommunities in the subproject areas will have equal opportunities to connect to \nelectricity grid; (ii) ADB has access to the project areas and can conduct \nconsultations about the project with all stakeholders and communities \nthroughout the project implementation period.  \nADB and development partners are working with the government to streamline \napproval procedures. Advance contracting is applied for the recruitment of the \nproject implementation consultants. Consultants working under the project \npreparatory technical assistance prepare all bidding documents and take \nadvance procurement actions as necessarya \nDevelopment partners are working closely with the government to prioritize \ninvestment needs and help the government mobilize financing, including \nmultilateral, bilateral, and private financing. ADB supports MOEE in preparing \nand applying a framework for PPP and in preparing a road map for \ncorporatization of distribution companies to make them more attractive to \ninvestors. \nThrough the Sector Coordination Group, ADB and development partners are \nhelping the MOEE prepare a cost-reflective tariff mechanism and improve \nfinancial management and reporting. The Loan Agreement includes a covenant \nrequiring the Borrower to ensure that electricity tariffs are reviewed and adjusted \nin a timely manner for ESE to maintain financial sustainability. \nConsiderable development partner efforts address this issue. A priority action \nplan between development partners and the MOEE included a transparent tariff-\nsetting mechanism reflecting the full cost of supply. ADB assisted the \ngovernment in preparing the rules and regulations for tariff setting and \nrecommendations for tariff implementation based on cost-recovery principles. \nThe World Bank supports studies on a mechanism for tariff setting and the \nimpacts of tariff subsidies. \n\na ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Power Network Development Project (TA 9179). \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n47. \nThe  government  and  the  MOEE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
