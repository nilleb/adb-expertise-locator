The  LGC\u2019s  \u201cfinance  follow  function\u201d \npremise set in place an intergovernmental transfer mechanism for \nsharing in the revenues of the Government of the Philippines (the \nGovernment) as well as allowing local governments to raise their \nown revenues. However, LGUs\u2019 capabilities in discharging their \nfunctions  continue  to  be  constrained,  so  the  Philippines  faces \nsignificant challenges in ensuring that stable mechanisms are in \nplace  to  channel  adequate  resources  to  local  governments. \nFinancial  accountability,  transparency,  and  capacity  also \nrepresent  significant  constraints  for  local  governments.  Finally, \nsignificant  improvement  is  needed  in  service  delivery, \ngovernance, and performance measurement. \n \nWhile the scope of decentralization includes fiscal, administrative, \nand political dimensions, the LGFBR focuses mainly on the fiscal \ndimension where the implementation difficulties have been most \nchallenging  and  are  perceived  as  binding.  It  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  improve  local  financing \n(facilitating  access  of  LGUs  to  development  credit),  service \ndelivery (credit financing for devolved services) and governance \n(improving  public  financial  management  and  implementation  of \nthe Government Procurement Reform Act of 2003 at the local \nlevel). The LGFBR program will broaden the reform program in \nfive target areas: (i) improving the completeness, timelines, and \ntransparency of local government shares in national revenues; (ii) ", "ii   \ndeepening reforms in fiscal management, planning, and public \nexpenditure  management  by  enhancing  efficiency  and \naccountability  in  these  areas;  (iii) enhancing  effectiveness  and \ntransparency in the delivery of critical public services at the local \nlevel; (iv) improving LGUs\u2019 access to public and private sources of \ncapital for financing policy reforms and development projects; and \n(v) reducing LGU dependency on the internal revenue allotment \n(IRA) by developing buoyant sources of revenues at the local \nlevel, thereby reducing fiscal pressure on the Government.  \n \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to  the  Philippines  is \ndetermined by the four pillars of the country strategy and program \n(CSP)  2005\u20132007:  (i)  fiscal  consolidation,  (ii)  strengthening \ninvestments, (iii) good governance, and (iv) support for achieving \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The  proposed \nLGFBR  program  contributes  to  fiscal  consolidation,  good \ngovernance,  and  achieving  the  MDGs  by:  (i)  lessening  LGU \ndependence on national government transfers through improved \nmobilization of own-source revenues and enhanced predictability \nof  resource  flows,  thereby  promoting  fiscal  consolidation; \n(ii) supporting  improved  delivery  of  essential  services  through \nimproved LGU access to developmental credit, thereby promoting \nactivities  for  achieving  the  MDGs;  and  (iii)  supporting  sector \nefficiency and improved governance by establishing transparent \nand accountable LGU financial and administrative management \nsystems for coordinated development planning, thereby promoting \ngood  governance  at  the  local  level.  The  reform  program  was \nprepared by a joint team of representatives of the Government \nand ADB working concertedly since 2006. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The proposed LGFBR program supports the Government in its \nefforts to help LGUs develop enhanced capacities to plan and \nbudget for the general welfare of their constituent communities in \na transparent and accountable way. It contributes to increased \nefficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of basic public services \nto residents by increasing fiscal resources and financing options \nfor the LGUs. The intended impact is achieved by strengthening \nthe  policy,  financing,  financial,  and  regulatory  framework  for \ndecentralization  as  well  as  developing  capacities  at  the  local \ngovernment level.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of \u00a534,253,100,000 ($300,000,000 equivalent) from the \nordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will  be  provided  under  the \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility for \nsubprogram 1 of the LGFBR program. The loan will have a 15-\nyear term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft program loan \nagreement.  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  has  discounted  the \ncommitment charge to 0.25% for loans approved from 1 July 2007 \nup to and including 30 June 2008. ", "  iii\nPeriod and Tranching  The  program  cluster  period  is  from  January  2006  to \nDecember 2010, with a single tranche loan of \u00a534,253,100,000 \n($300 million equivalent) to be disbursed under subprogram 1 \nwhen the Government has met the conditions for effectiveness. \nSubprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board  consideration \napproximately 36 months after the effectiveness of subprogram 1, \nsubject to adequate progress of reforms and the Government\u2019s \nreadiness to continue with its reform agenda. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand associated costs of local reforms. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Finance (DOF) \n   \nImplementation  The  Department  of  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG), \nArrangements  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM),  National \nEconomic and Development Authority (NEDA), Bureau of Local \nGovernment  Finance  (BLGF),  and  Municipal  Development \nFinance  Office  (MDFO)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  Program.  An  LGFBR \ncoordination  committee  (the  Committee)  has  been  established \nand  is  chaired  by  the  undersecretary  of  DOF  and  comprises \nofficials  from  DILG,  DBM,  and  NEDA.  It  is  responsible  for \ncoordinating the implementation of the LGFBR program reform \nactions. The Committee meets quarterly to monitor progress and \noversee implementation of the Program, and provides guidance \nand direction to the executing and implementing agencies.   \n   \nProcurement and  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nDisbursement  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the \nBorrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The LGFBR program will provide significant benefits and will have \nBeneficiaries  a  positive  impact  on  local  service  delivery,  financing,  and \ngovernance issues. The key expected benefits are as follows: \n(i)  Streamlined intergovernmental fiscal relations as a result \nof  completeness,  timeliness,  and  transparency  in  the \nrelease  and  reporting  of  LGU  shares  in  national \ngovernment revenues\u2014thereby improving the accuracy of \nlocal budgeting and programming of local expenditures. \n(ii)  Improved  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in \nplanning,  public  expenditure  management,  and  financial \nmanagement as a result of rationalized and streamlined \nnational government oversight functions and strengthened \nlocal capacity. ", "iv   \n(iii)  Enhanced delivery of critical public services at the local \nlevel by providing additional financing options and linking \nthem  to  performance  outcomes  as  well  as  improved \nnational  government-LGU  arrangements  for  devolved \nfunctions. \n(iv)  Greater  LGU  access  to  public  and  private  sources  of \ncapital as a result of an improved policy and institutional \nenvironment, thereby contributing to increasing LGU ability \nto finance the delivery of local public services. \n(v)  Increased LGU own-source revenues to fund social and \ndevelopment  expenditures  as  a  result  of  strengthened \nLGU capacity to generate revenues from real property and \nbusiness  taxes\u2014thereby  reducing  LGU  reliance  on \nnational government transfers, and consequently reducing \nthe Government\u2019s fiscal burden. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  While some of risks are irreducibly political\u2014outside the scope of \nthe Program to mitigate directly\u2014core elements of the Program \nand  advisory  TA  contribute  to  mitigating  these  risks  through \ngreater  transparency  and  accountability  mechanisms  that \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  local  authorities  and  provide  active \nmonitoring  by  civil  society  groups.  The  potential  risks  to \nsubprogram 1 and underlying assumptions are the following:  \n(i)   Political delays. Delays may be experienced in engaging \nthe LGUs for the second phase since the election for their \nLeague  officers  are  held  in  the  third  quarter  of  2007. \nHowever, the Leagues have endorsed the phase one and \ntwo triggers and it is expected that no major changes in \npolicy  orientation  will  occur  despite  changes  in  the \nExecutive Board of the Leagues. \n(ii)   External  pressures.  Deterioration  in  the  external \nenvironment may trigger internal financial problems and \nmay encourage the Government not to release the IRA \namount  fully  to  the  LGUs.  A  portion  of  the  IRA  was \nwithheld  during  the  1997  financial  crisis  since  it  was \ndetermined to be an \u201cunmanageable public sector deficit\u201d. \nHowever,  the  Government  is  strongly  committed  to \nachieving  its  fiscal  consolidation  objectives  to  maintain \nmacroeconomic stability. In addition, legislative and legal \nmeasures are now in place to prevent a recurrence of the \n1997 chain of events.  \n(iii)   Coordination and capacity constraints. The willingness \nfor  coordination  among  oversight  agencies  for \nharmonization of local planning, investment programming, \nrevenue  administration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure \nmanagement  may  weaken  over  time.  However,  the \nGovernment  is  committed  to  implementing  the  joint \nmemorandum circular (JMC) 2007-1. To resolve possible \nissues  and  ensure  continued  progress,  a  technical \ncommittee  is  being  organized  to  oversee  JMC \nimplementation. ", "  v\n(iv)   Resource constraints. The Government may run out of \nresources  for  capacity  development  activities  planned \nunder this Program. Although these are heavily funded by \ncurrent  ADB  projects,  it  is  possible  that  some  training \nprograms may be underfunded. An advisory TA is being \nprovided to fill any such gaps. However, many donors are \nalso  providing  TA  grants  for  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment at the local level.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In  connection  with  the  LGFBR  program,  the  Government  has \nasked ADB for an advisory TA grant. The TA is estimated to cost \na total of $1,100,000, of which ADB will finance $800,000 on a \ngrant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA will support the development of a \nmedium-term reform agenda in local government financing and \ngovernance  and  its  implementation,  as  well  as  provide  the \nGovernment  with  just-in-time  policy  advice.  It  will  include  the \nfollowing  areas:  (i)  support  creation  and  functioning  of  a \nCoordination  Committee  on  Decentralization  to  promote, \ncoordinate, and oversee decentralization reforms, including the \nchanges  envisaged  in  the  LGFBR  program  policy  matrix; \n(ii) analysis  of  existing  capacities  for  planning  and  budget \nmanagement at city level, development and pilot testing of revised \nplanning  and  budgeting  systems,  and  preparation  and \ndissemination of city planning guidelines; and (iii) development of \nthe local government  performance measurement system to be \nused  as  a  tool  to  link  access  to  intergovernmental  transfers, \ngrants, and capacity development support with service delivery \nperformance. A total of 95 person-months of national consultancy \nwill  be  required.  All  recruitment  and  engagement  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Republic of the Philippines for the Local Government Financing and \nBudget Reform (LGFBR) program comprising two subprograms, and (ii) a proposed loan for \nsubprogram  1  of  the  LGFBR.  The  LGFBR  program  was  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of \nrepresentatives  of  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  (the  Government)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \ndeveloping capacity for oversight agencies. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, will approve the TA. The \nprogram design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The basic premise of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u2013\n2010 is to fight poverty by building prosperity for the greatest number of the Filipino people. The \nMTPDP outlines the strategy of the administration in the 10-point legacy agenda, one of which \nfocuses on good local governance through decentralized development, and decongestion of \nMetro Manila and creation of new growth centers across the country. The MTPDP reinforces \nand supports the principles outlined in the Local Government Code (LGC). \n \n3.  Consistent with the MTPDP, the Philippines country strategy and program (CSP) 2005\u2013\n20071 is based on an analysis and prioritization of binding constraints to more rapid growth, \ngreater inclusiveness, and faster poverty reduction. The CSP breaks with ADB\u2019s past model for \nengaging with the Philippines in fundamental ways by introducing a thematic, rather than sector-\nbased, strategic focus; greater project selectivity; and a results-based partnership with high \nlending contingent on macroeconomic performance. The strategy outlined in the CSP supports \nand advances the objectives of decentralization and good local governance, and is aligned with \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. When endorsing the CSP in mid-2005, ADB\u2019s Board noted \nthat  new  public  sector  lending  commitments  could  be  up  to  $1.5  billion  for  the  3  years, \ndepending on the pace and quality of fiscal consolidation and sector reforms. Because of the \nlarge  budget  deficit  of  2.7%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2005,  new  lending \ncommitments were low ($175 million). Subsequently, fiscal consolidation gained traction as the \ndeficit dropped to 1% of GDP in 2006 and is expected to fall to 0.9% in 2007 and a balanced \nbudget by 2008. This created the policy space for ADB to move to a \u201chigh case\u201d lending \nscenario, with lending of $650 million in 2006 and an expected $700 million in 2007.  \n \n4.  The improved macroeconomic performance and stability achieved in 2006 continued into \n2007. The Philippine economy ended 2006 with overall annual real GDP growth of 5.4%. This \nwas slightly up from 5% in 2005 and above the average growth rate of 4.3% per annum from \n1990 to 2005. Table 1 presents data on key indicators for 2005 and 2006 to show the sustained \npositive macroeconomic performance and stability since 2004. Economic growth accelerated to \n7.5%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007,  among  the  highest  growth  rates  in  Southeast  Asia. \nServices continued to be the fastest growing sector with average annual growth of 6.7% since \n2003, contributing to almost 60% of economic growth, followed by manufacturing and utilities. \nSecond quarter 2007 growth was led by the services sector growing by 8.4% year on year, with \nindustry following at 8%. On the demand side, consumption spending contributed to 70\u201380% of \neconomic growth, followed by a strong pickup in electronics and garments exports. In the \nsecond quarter of 2007, consumer spending rose by 6% while government spending rose by \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Reducing Fiscal Deficit. The Government has attempted to trim the fiscal deficit by \nraising  the  tax  effort  and  improving  expenditure  management.  After  implementing  several \ndifficult tax and fiscal measures, the consolidated public sector deficit declined from a peak of \n5.2% of GDP in 2003 to 1.9% in 2005, and almost balanced in 2006 (deficit of 0.2% of GDP), \nsurpassing its target of a 2% deficit. The small consolidated public sector deficit was aided by a \nfall in the Government\u2019s budget deficit of 1.1% of GDP in 2006, well below its programmed \ntarget deficit of 2.1%, and substantial reduction in the deficit of the National Power Corporation. \nThe Government\u2019s fiscal deficit for the first 5 months of 2007 reached P41.8 billion or stabilized \naround 1.0\u20131.5% of GDP, on track to meet its programmed target for 2007.2 Tax revenues \nperformed  strongly  in  2006,  growing  by  22%,  with  revenues  from  value-added  tax  (VAT) \ngrowing by about 64% because of the implementation of reforms that increased the tax-GDP \nratio to 14.3% in 2006 from 13% in 2005. Local government units (LGUs), social security \ninstitutions, and government financial institutions (GFIs) all recorded surpluses. Because of the \nimproved  fiscal  position,  the  Government  was  able  to  reduce  its  borrowings  in  2006;  the \nborrowing cost also decreased.  \n \n6.  The medium-term outlook for the Philippines remains positive. Projections for economic \ngrowth this year range between 5.4% and 6.0%, with an increase in growth expected in 2008 \nled  by  consumption  and  exports,  and  with  recovery  in  investment.  Notwithstanding  the \neconomy\u2019s improved performance, GDP and gross national product (GNP) growth rates remain \n                                                 \n2  Bureau  of  Treasury,  Department  of  Finance.  2007.  Budget  Report  for  May  2007.  Manila.  Available: \nhttp://www.treasury.gov.ph/  \n ", "  3 \nbelow the targets set by the MTPDP of 6.3\u20137.3% (GDP) and 6.5\u20137.5% (GNP). Higher growth is \nrequired  to  address  the  goals  of  poverty  reduction  and  attainment  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The Philippines appears on track to achieve several MDG targets \nbut  it  is  behind  targets  in  health,  education,  and  environment  because  of  expenditure \ncompression  adopted  by  the  Government  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit.  For  the  MTPDP\u2019s \nmacroeconomic reform efforts to bear fruit, the Government needs to address wide-ranging \npolicy  and  institutional  issues  at  the  subnational  level.  More  fundamentally,  it  has  to  take \nadvantage of the initial gains arising from decentralization and devolution initiatives of the past \ndecade, which have encouraged growth in the regions and the LGUs. While the macroeconomic \nand  fiscal  consolidation  reforms  have  provided  an  enabling  context  for  economic  growth, \nreforms need to be more widely implemented at the LGU level. In many important ways, the \nLGUs  are  now  the  fulcrum  of  the  development  process  and  are  recognized  as  the  most \nimportant agents for pursuing sustained national growth and alleviating overall poverty. \n \n7.  Since 2004, the Government-led Philippine Development Forum (PDF) has evolved as a \npotent platform for advancing the country\u2019s development agenda. Through its Working Group on \nDecentralization  and  Local  Government,  the  PDF3 provides  a  forum  for  dialogue  on  core \ndevelopment  issues,  including  those  concerning  local  governments  (finance,  capacity \ndevelopment, performance benchmarking, and policy reforms on devolution). PDF serves as a \nvehicle through which all stakeholders\u2014development partners, government agencies, LGUs, \nprivate sector, and civil society organizations\u2013\u2013coordinate their efforts by sharing information \nand  discussing  reform  programs.  PDF  has  also  provided  policy  advice  and  technical \nbackstopping to LGU Leagues4 to enhance their advocacy to key government agencies. ADB \nplays a major role in this working group, serving as co-chair of the sub-working group for LGU \ncapacity development, and participating actively in development partner dialogues concerning \nlocal  development.  Through  the  PDF,  ADB  and  the  Government  have  shared  the  policy \nmeasures outlined in the LGFBR program with other development partners.  \n \n8.  Moreover, the CSP encourages ADB to widen its constituency of partners to enhance \nthe  quality  and  relevance  of  its  activities.  Since  2005,  ADB\u2019s  program  has  included  more \nintensive  interaction  with  the  LGUs  through  loans  and  TA  projects  that  support  capacity \ndevelopment,  public  expenditure  management,  investment  planning,  widening  access  to \nfinancing  sources,  improved  service  delivery,  and  performance  monitoring.5 The  LGFBR \nprogram is the first policy-based program cluster for the Philippines that tackles major policy \nissues  to  strengthen  local  governance  as  envisioned  in  the  MTPDP  and  the  CSP.  It \ncomplements the broader policy support provided by the Development Policy Support Program \n(DPSP). While the LGFBR strengthens the LGUs and government institutions that directly \nsupport local development, the DPSP supports a broader national strategy of policy reforms in \nfour  target  areas:  (i)  fiscal  consolidation  and  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  public  financial \nmanagement and anticorruption, (iii) investment climate and infrastructure, and (iv) protecting \n                                                 \n3  Available: http://pdf.ph/decentralization_1.htm  \n4  LGU Leagues were created under the LGC to act as a coordinating and advocacy body for each level of local \ngovernment.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Review of the Sector and Performance  \n9.  Unlike in many other countries, decentralization is well grounded in both the constitution \nand legal framework of the Philippines. The economic rationale for decentralization that it can \nimprove  governance  by  making  public  service  delivery  more  efficient  was  an  important \nconsideration in shaping reforms. Local governments are in closer contact with citizens than the \nnational Government, so they are better placed to respond to citizens\u2019 preferences, which allow \nthem to match services to local needs. In practice, however, decentralization reforms were \nmostly driven by political considerations. In the Philippines, the decision was sparked by strong \nreactions to a period of centralized authority. This was reflected in the 1987 Constitution, which \n ", "  5 \nassured  autonomy  to  local  governments.  The  1991  LGC  outlined  key  aspects  of  the \nintergovernmental system by defining local functional assignments, allocating a share for LGUs \nin the national revenues, and allowing LGUs to raise their own revenues.6 However, while the \nbasic structure for decentralization is now in place, there is a need to improve local fiscal \ncapacity and to fine tune the intergovernmental relations in above areas. \n \n10.  Local Autonomy and Governance. The LGC created important local bodies like the \nLocal  Development  Council  (LDC)  and  mandated  participatory  planning  to  strengthen \naccountability. The LGC elaborates on local autonomy by providing the following governance \nfeatures: (i) accountability, with the term of office set at 3 years; (ii) transparency, with local \nofficials mandated to submit their statements of assets and liabilities, and members of the \nSanggunian  (legislative  assembly)  required  to  disclose  their  business  interests;  and  (iii) \nparticipation, with local governments mandated to create local special bodies for school, health, \npeace,  and  development  with  representation  from  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs). \nAlthough decentralization can strengthen accountability, a number of key governance risks \nemanating from the inherently political nature of decentralization could weaken the economic \nbenefits of decentralization: (i) state/elite capture, (ii) clientelism, (iii) capacity constraints, (iv) \npower struggle between levels of government, and (v) weaknesses in interregional informational \nflows that are critical for effective competition (Appendix 5). Powers in the LGUs tend to be \nconcentrated in the executive, with weak representation from institutions that are to check on \nstate capture, such as the judiciary. This is mitigated partly by the countervailing forces of \nempowerment  of,  and  widening  participation  by,  communities  in  local  affairs.  Civil  society \ngroups in the Philippines have mushroomed at the local level.  \n \n11.  Local  Autonomy  and  Service  Delivery.  The LGC devolved responsibilities of the \nGovernment to the LGU level at three tiers (Figure 2). LGUs were made responsible for the \n\u201cgeneral  welfare\u201d  of  their  constituencies  by:  (i)  devolving  the  service  delivery  functions  of \nnational  government  agencies  to  LGUs,  (ii)  transferring  the  regulatory  functions  of  certain \nnational government agencies to LGUs (these include zoning and reclassification, watershed \nmanagement and fishing vessels operating within 15 km radius of LGU shoreline); and (iii) \nenhancing the governmental and corporate powers of LGUs to enable them to discharge the \ndevolved powers and functions effectively. The LGC transferred to LGUs the main responsibility \nfor the delivery of basic services and the operation of facilities for land use planning, agricultural \nextension and research, community-based forestry, solid waste disposal system, environmental \nmanagement, primary health care, hospital care, social welfare services, municipal services and \nenterprises,  and  local  infrastructure  facilities.  The  construction  of  public  school  buildings \nbecame a shared function between the Department of Education and LGUs. The provinces are \nassigned functions that involve the inter-municipal provision of services such as operation and \nmaintenance  of  district  and  provincial  hospitals.  The  municipalities  are  responsible  for  the \ndelivery of basic services, such as primary health care, and construction and maintenance of \npublic elementary schools. The sub national share of expenditure in the Philippines is around 26 \npercent of the total government expenditure (as compared to 46% for Vietnam and 10% for \nThailand).7Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix A analyze the structure, functions, and \nissues relating to LGUs. \n                                                 \n6  It transfers the authority for decision making, finance, and management to quasi-autonomous units of local \ngovernment; and disperses the responsibility for certain services to regional branch offices. It also transfers \nresponsibility for decision making and the administration of public functions to local governments not wholly \ncontrolled by the central Government, but wholly accountable to it. \n7  World Bank. 2005. East Asia Decentralizes. Washington, DC. There is some evidence, however, that a more \naccurate measure of the extent of decentralization is the share of own-source revenues: in the Philippines this ratio \nexceeds that of Vietnam considerably (see page 14, para 37). \n ", "6 \n \n \nFigure 2: Structure of the Local Government System in the Philippines \n \n  National Government \n  (20 National Government Departments) \n \n \n \n  Province\nHighly  Independent\n-Urbanized City   Component City  (81)  Level 1 \n \n  (28)  (4) \n \n \n  Component  Municipality \nCity   (1,510)  Level 2 \n  (86)  \n \n \nBarangays  Barangays Barangays Barangays \nLevel 3 \n(2,726)  (211)  (3,858)  (35,200) \n \n \nTotal number of cities = 118; total number of barangays = 41,995. \nSource: National Statistics Coordination Board (as of March 2007). \n \n12.  Administrative  and  Political  Dimension  of  Decentralization.  Under  the  LGC, \nprovinces  have  administrative  oversight  over  component  cities  and  municipalities\u2014except \nhighly  urbanized  and  independent  component  cities.  Cities  and  municipalities  have \nadministrative oversight over barangays(villages). Each level of government up to the barangay \nhas its own budget. At the national government level, five agencies have varying degrees of \noversight over the LGUs. The Department of Finance (DOF) through the Bureau of Local \nGovernment  Finance  (BLGF)  provides  oversight  through  local  treasurers  and  assessors \nregarding  local  revenue  management  and  taxation.  The  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement (DBM) oversees budget and expenditure matters. The National Economic and \nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA)  oversees  local  planning  at  the  provincial  level  while  the \nDepartment of Interior and Local Government (DILG) oversees local planning at the city and \nmunicipal level. The Commission on Audit (COA) has oversight of accounting and audit matters. \nOf the five agencies, only COA has regulatory powers over LGUs. \n \n13.  Fiscal Dimension of Decentralization\u2013\u2013Resources. In the Philippines, the concept of \n\u201cfinance follows function\u201d is adhered to, which means greater local autonomy is synonymous \nwith greater fiscal and financial autonomy. In this context, it is not surprising that most of the \nissues that have arisen from the implementation of the LGC relate to Book II of the LGC (Fiscal \nMatters and Taxation). These include issues related to intergovernmental transfers and the \nextent of LGUs\u2019 taxing powers. Issues in Book III (Local Government Units), such as the \nconversion of municipalities to cities, also have fiscal implications. The efforts of municipalities \nto become cities, so that they can get larger share of transfers, is a case in point. The LGC \nprovided greater fiscal autonomy to LGUs by entitling them to (i) a 40% share in the collection of \nnational revenue taxes referred to as Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), (ii) a share in the \nincremental revenue from the collection of VAT, and (iii) a 40% share in the tax collected from \nutilization of natural resources in their respective geographical areas. In addition, LGUs are \nempowered to levy taxes, charges, and user fees not imposed by the Government; issue debt to \n ", "  7 \nthe  private  sector;  enter  into  nontraditional  business  arrangements  such  as  build-operate-\ntransfer and joint venture agreements; and operate income-generating or economic enterprises. \n \n14.  Fiscal Dimension of Decentralization\u2013\u2013Development Spending. Since the objective \nof decentralization is for LGUs to provide for the general welfare of their communities, the \nefficient and effective delivery of basic services becomes the standard by which outcomes are \nmeasured. In line with the transfer of functions and more resources at their disposal, the total \nLGU expenditure expanded relative to GNP  and total government  expenditure. Total LGU \nspending doubled from an average of 1.6% of GNP in 1985\u20131991 to 3.4% of GNP in 1992\u2013\n2005. Similarly, the share of LGUs in total general government expenditure, net of debt service, \nrose from an average of 11.0% in the pre-Code period to an average of 24.2% in the post-Code \nperiod (Appendix 5, Table A5.1). The major increase in LGU spending on social services \nbetween 1991 and 2005 went to health and education. Aggregate LGU expenditure on health \nrose almost threefold from 0.1% of GNP in 1991 to 0.3% of GNP in 2005, while LGU spending \non education doubled from 0.1% of GNP to 0.2% of GNP. Table 2 presents the distribution of \nLGU social expenditure during 2001\u20132005 and shows that education and health comprise more \nthan 78% of total social expenditures. However, social expenditures for housing and community \ndevelopment and social welfare have been declining or stagnant over the same period. \n \nTable 2: Subsectoral Distribution of LGU Social Expenditure, 2001\u20132005 \n(percent at current prices) \n    Health,    Housing and     \n    Nutrition, and  Labor and  Community  Social  Total Social \nYear  Education  Population  Employment  Development  Welfare  Expenditure \nControl  \n2001  27.1  44.0  0.6  16.8  11.6  100.0 \n2002  25.5  45.7  0.6  17.2  11.0  100.0 \n2003  30.1  47.6  0.5  10.5  11.3  100.0 \n2004  29.9  49.7  0.3  9.3  10.8  100.0 \n2005  31.9  46.8  0.3  10.0  11.0  100.0 \nLGU = local government unit. \nSource: Department of Finance: Bureau of Local Government Finance-Statement of Receipts and Expenditures. \n \n15.  Service Delivery in Health and Education. The increase in education spending largely \nreflects the higher priority that local officials assign to this sector, as the LGUs did not have to \nabsorb devolved personnel. On the other hand, the increase in health spending was largely \nbecause LGUs absorbed the devolved health personnel, which constituted over half the total \ncost  of  all  devolved  personnel.  Studies  show  that  average  annual  improvement  in  the \npercentage of underweight children per 1,000 declined from 0.93% in the pre-devolution period \nto 0.19% in the post-devolution period, and average annual improvement in the number of \ndeaths  per 1,000  declined  from  0.70%  in  the  pre-devolution  period  to  0.34%  in  the  post-\ndevolution period.8 On the other hand, the average annual improvement in infant mortality rate \nincreased from 0.3% in the pre-devolution period to 1.5% during the post-devolution period. The \nelementary level participation rate increased from 84.6% in the pre-devolution period to 88.9% \nin the post-devolution period, while secondary level participation rate increased from 54.7% in \nthe pre-devolution period to 61.7% in the post-devolution period9. \n \n16.  The  major  bottlenecks  that  constrain  improvements  in  local  service  delivery  and \ngovernance can broadly be attributed to four factors: (i) unclear expenditure assignments, \n(ii) lack of resources, (iii) weak fiscal and expenditure management, and (iv) lack of performance \n                                                 \n8 Bautista, V.A. 2002. Philippine Experience in Health Service Decentralization. Manila: University of the Philippines.  \n9 Department of Education.  \n ", "8 \nmeasurement.  Unclear  expenditure  assignments  result  from  an  inappropriate  matching  of \nexpenditure  assignments  or  functions  and  resources  both  at  the  inter-governmental  level \n(i.e., national government and LGUs) and intra-governmental levels (i.e., between provinces \nand cities). The lack of resources is mainly due to insufficient access of LGUs to development \ncredit from public sources for social projects and private capital markets for income-generating \nprojects,  uncertainty  in  national  transfers,  and  insufficient  generation  of  local  own-source \nrevenues.  Weak  fiscal  and  expenditure  management  can  be  attributed  to  a  lack  of  clear \nguidance and support from national government oversight agencies and weak local capacity. \nThe ineffective performance measurement system is due to insufficient resources to improve \nexisting systems and lack of incentives for LGUs to be more performance-oriented. These \nlimiting factors have been categorized in the next section. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Unclear  Expenditure  Assignments  and  Overlapping  Service  Delivery \nMandates  \n \n17.  Although the main responsibility for the delivery of basic services has been devolved to \nLGUs,  the  institutional  arrangements  are  not  always  clear.  National  government  agencies \ncontinue to play a significant role in the planning and implementation of functions that have \nlegally been devolved. Although Section 17 (b) of the LGC enumerates the basic services that \nLGUs are expected to deliver, Sections 17 (c)10 and (f)11 encourage a two-track delivery system \nwhere both the Government and LGUs can initiate devolved activities. This complicates what \nshould  have  been  a  clear-cut  assignment  of  service  deliveries  and  blurs  expenditure \nresponsibilities. It has proven difficult to separate the oversight functions of line agencies from \nservice delivery functions, as line agencies also tend to engage in direct service delivery for \ndevolved functions. Many of the devolved national government agencies remain accountable for \nservice  delivery  in  their  respective  areas.  For  example,  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH) \ncontinues to be in charge of the country\u2019s overall state of health, just as the Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources (DENR) is still held responsible for national environmental \nmanagement. Therefore, they feel compelled to make full use of Section 17 (f) of the Code, so  \nthe budgets of national agencies continue to grow disproportionately. The justification given by \nthe  agencies  is  that  there  is  a  need  to  ensure  that  national  policy  objectives  are  met. \nFurthermore, oversight agencies, such as DBM, have insufficient capacity and mechanisms to \ncontrol spending for devolved functions by line agencies. There is a need to develop more \nindirect instruments for ensuring that policy objectives are met, such as specific grants.  \n \n18.  The  ability  of  LGUs  to  provide  devolved  services  at  their  own  discretion  is  further \nconstrained by many unfunded mandates left to them by the Government. For example, LGUs \nare expected to provide budgetary support (either in the form of additional personnel benefits or \noutlays for maintenance and other operating expenses) to many national government agencies \noperating at the same level such as the police, fire protection, and local courts. LGUs also have \nto comply with nationally prescribed controls on their local budget allocations, especially in \npersonnel services. They are required to comply with standardization of salaries in the public \nsector and continue to provide for additional benefits to devolved health workers under the \nMagna Carta for Health Workers.  \n                                                 \n10 \u201cNotwithstanding [LGU mandate to deliver enumerated basic services and facilities], facilities, programs, and \nservices funded by the National Government \u2026 are not covered by the [devolution] except in those cases where \nthe [LGU] concerned is duly designated as the implementing agency for such \u2026\u201d \n11  \u201cThe National Government ... may provide or augment the basic services and facilities assigned to the ... LGU \nwhen the services or facilities are not made available or \u2026 are inadequate \u2026\u201d \n ", "  9 \n19.  Recent Developments. There is a need to clarify the expenditure assignments and \nfunctional roles of various levels of the Government to eliminate jurisdictional overlaps and to \nreduce the gaps between mandates and funding. This will make the expenditure and budget \nneeds  of  LGUs  more  transparent  and  improve  accountability  in  the  management  of  their \nresources. Executive Order (EO) 366 was issued in 2004 requiring government departments to \nstrategically review their operations and organizational structures. Staffing levels were to be \nrationalized  to  remove  overlaps  and  duplications,  redirect  resources  to  vital  services,  and \nimprove the quality and efficiency of service delivery. In July 2005, EO 444 was issued directing \nDILG to conduct a strategic review of the devolution of government services and functions. \nDILG  is  reviewing  decentralization  in  five  priority  departments\u2014Department  of  Agriculture, \nDepartment of Social Welfare and Development, DOF, DOH, and DENR. The review is being \ndone in consultation with the Leagues, departments concerned, and oversight agencies. It is \nexpected to be completed in 2008.12 \n \n20.  To address the issues emerging from devolution\u2014especially in the light of rationalization \nof the bureaucracy, recurring problems emerging from implementation of the LGC, and the need \nto review its provisions (an action prescribed in the LGC every 5 years)\u2014the Government is \nexploring the possibility of constituting the Coordination Committee on Decentralization (CCD). \nMembership of the CCD will be drawn from the legislature, executive (oversight agencies), LGU \nLeagues, and others. The committee will discuss solutions to such issues and, if necessary, \npropose amendments to the Code.  \n \n2.  Lack of Completeness, Timeliness, and Transparency in Intergovernmental  \n    Fiscal Transfers \n \n21.  National Transfers. Government transfers to LGUs are of three types: (i) formula-based \nblock grants (i.e., IRA); (ii) origin-based share in national government revenues (i.e., share in \nnational  wealth  and  other  taxes);  and  (iii)  ad  hoc  categorical  grants.  Under  the  LGC,  the \naggregate IRA of LGUs is set at 40% of the actual internal revenue tax collections of the \nGovernment  3  years  prior  to  the current  year.  The  aggregate  IRA  is  then  divided  among \ndifferent  local  government  levels  as  follows:  23%  to  provinces,  23%  to  cities,  34%  to \nmunicipalities, and 20% to barangays. The IRA share of each tier of local government is then \napportioned to individual LGUs based on population (50%), land area (25%), and equal sharing \n(25%)13.  \n \n22.  The IRA is the most significant revenue source, especially for third to sixth income class \nLGUs14. For example, IRA accounts for 88% of the regular income of third income class \nprovinces, 94.5% of fourth income class provinces, and 80% of third to fifth income class \nmunicipalities.15 The IRA surged from 3.9% of government revenues (3.3% of government \nexpenditures or 0.6% of GNP) in 1985\u20131991 to 14.6% of government revenues (12.3% of \ngovernment expenditures or 2.2% of GNP) in 1992\u20132005. The contribution of the IRA to total \nLGU income net of borrowings expanded from 36.7% in 1985\u20131991 to 64.6% in 1992\u20132005 for \nall LGUs combined (Table 3). This trend is more prominent in provinces and municipalities than \ncities. It increased from 33.2% (pre-LGC) to 46.2% (post-LGC) in cities, compared to 38.3% \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006.

International  best  practice  norms  have  been  moving  towards  simplifying  complex \nintergovernmental transfer systems, improving the transparency and predictability of allocations, \nand increasing subnational discretion over the use of these resources.16 National transfers have \nbeen criticized for: (i) lack of reliability in releases and appropriations, which undermine the \nability of LGUs to plan and manage expenditures effectively; (ii) inequalities and distortions in \ndistribution built into the current allocation system (i.e., allocation among various levels of LGUs \nand between different LGUs at the same level, making some LGUs such as cities better off in \nterms of net transfers less cost of devolved functions); and (iii) negative incentives created for \nlocal revenue generation since LGUs are assured of income from the IRA and the increase in \nthe IRA share is subject to improvements in national tax collections instead of good governance \non the part of LGUs.  \n \n24.  Lack of Reliability in the IRA Release. This constraint not only affects LGUs\u2019 ability to \nbudget and plan effectively, but also limits their ability to tap finances since creditors rely heavily \non the IRA deposits as collateral. Despite the provisions of the LGC, the Government retained \nconsiderable discretion in appropriating and releasing IRA. The transfers evolved into a highly \nunpredictable revenue source between 1998 and 2004 as the Government, faced with fiscal \nconstraints, persistently reduced the amount due to LGUs. In 4 of the 6 years between 1998 \nand 2004, the mandated IRA share was either not appropriated in full, or not released in full or \nin a timely fashion, or was effectively cut because of reenactment of the budget. The gap \nbetween appropriation and obligation ranges from P1.5 billion to P16.5 billion. The Supreme \nCourt  ruled  twice  in  favor  of  LGUs:  in  2000,  it  ruled  that  the  IRA  should  be  released \nautomatically; and in 2004, it ruled that the IRA should not only be automatically released but \nalso distributed according to the Codal formula. In July 2006, the Government closed the loop \nby passing the Republic Act 9358 which provided for automatic annual appropriation of the IRA \nwithout the need to pass through Congress. To complement the reforms in the predictability, \ntransparency, and timeliness of the IRA releases, DBM has started posting IRA shares of LGUs \non its website beginning January 2007. DBM is also instituting the distribution of a local budget \nmemorandum (LBM) to LGUs, announcing their IRA shares for the next year by June of every \nyear. The monthly releases of the Notice of Cash Allocations will also be posted along with the \ncomprehensive allotment release within the first quarter of every year.   \n \n25.  Inter and Intra LGU Inequalities in the IRA. Although the IRA transfer to LGUs has \nexceeded the cost of devolved functions in the aggregate, for some LGUs (notably provinces \n                                                 \n16  Shroeder, L., and P. Smoke. 2003. Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers: Concepts, International Practice and Policy \nIssues. Manila.  \n ", "  11 \nand  municipalities)  the  transfers  do  not  completely  cover  the  cost  of  devolved  functions. \nGenerally, cities have emerged as relative winners in accessing transfers while provinces and \nmunicipalities have not fared favorably (118 cities share 23% while 1,510 municipalities share \n34% of the IRA). This has created incentives for municipalities to lobby to become a city. This \npoints to the need for strengthening the capacity of the Government to equalize fiscal capacity \nand to monitor the financial performance of LGUs. DILG is currently commissioning a study to \nrecommend amendments to the IRA allocation formula with a more equalizing factor. \n \n26.  Non-IRA  Transfers:  Grants. The Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) is \nallocated to members of Congress for discretionary spending at LGU level. These funds have \nbeen channeled to local investments in a non-transparent way, undermining LGU planning for \nstrategic use of such funds. It is estimated that non-IRA funding to LGUs is P25.4 billion, with \nCongressional allocations amounting to over 60% of this amount.17 To improve transparency in \nthe allocation and use of such funds, DBM is posting the PDAF figures on its website.  \n \n27.  Non-IRA Transfers: Share in National Wealth. Some LGUs are entitled to a 40% \nshare in tax collections and royalties from the exploitation of their natural resources. These \nspecial shares include mining taxes, tax on energy resources, forestry charges, and mining \nroyalties.  The  timely  and  complete  release  of  LGU  shares  in  national  wealth  taxes  was \nhampered by: (i) problems in accurately estimating the tax collections from natural resources \nsince actual tax collections for the immediately preceding year are not yet known when the \nGeneral Appropriations Act (GAA) is prepared; and (ii) lack of information on the situs18 of the \ntax. In February 2006, DBM, DOF, DENR, and Department of Energy issued Joint Circular No. \n2006-1 which streamlined estimation and determination of the situs and procedures for release \nof LGU shares in national wealth by reducing the documentary requirements from five to two.  \n \n3.  Weak  Governance  and  Systems  in  Public  Financial  Management,  Local \nDevelopment Planning, and Expenditure Management \n \n28.  Planning and Budgeting Linkage. The LGC prescribes a participatory approach to \nplanning  and  mandates  that  each  LGU  should  have  a  comprehensive,  multi-sectoral \ndevelopment plan formulated by its LDC and approved by its legislature. However, only 30\u201350% \nof LGUs have LDCs in place. In addition, the LGC mandates that 25% of LDC members should \ncome from NGOs, but compliance is poor. Weak coordination between the Government and \nLGU planning has resulted in a break in the planning chain\u2014occurring between the regional \nand  provincial  levels.  Local  officials  report  that  their  investment  plans  are  formulated \nindependent  of  regional  and  national  investment  plans  and  vice  versa.  Less  than  70%  of \nprovinces have up-to-date local development plans (LDPs) and annual investment plans (AIPs), \nwhich often are not linked to each other. Furthermore, AIPs do not appear to be anchored in \nclear goals, strategies, and programs as many LGUs do not perform systematic evaluation of \nprojects\u2019  costs  and  benefits.  The  integrity  of  local  budgeting  is  distorted  by  poor  revenue \nestimates during the budget formulation process.19  \n \n29.  Recent  Developments.  Some  recent  initiatives  by  the  Government  strengthen  the \nplanning and budgeting link. In March 2007, DBM, DOF, DILG, and NEDA jointly issued joint \nmemorandum  circular  (JMC)  No.  1\u2014Guidelines  on  the  Harmonization  of  Local  Planning, \nInvestment Programming, Revenue Administration, Budgeting, and Expenditure Management. \n                                                 \n17  World Bank. 2003.

Decentralization in the Philippines. Washington, DC. \n ", "12 \nIts purpose is to: (i) provide guidelines on the harmonization and synchronization of local \nplanning,  investment  programming,  revenue  administration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure \nmanagement; (ii) strengthen coordination between LGUs and national government agencies on \nmutually supporting approaches to planning, investment programming, revenue administration, \nbudgeting, and expenditure management; and (iii) clarify responsibilities among DILG, NEDA, \nDOF, and DBM relative to local planning, investment programming, revenue administration, \nbudgeting, and expenditure management. DBM has completed and issued the Updated Budget \nOperations Manual (UBOM), which contains basic principles and guidelines that will form the \nplatform  for  performance-based  budgeting.  Although  it  is  unlikely  that  the  organization \nperformance indicators framework (OPIF) will be introduced to LGUs within the next 3 years, \ngiven that the priority is to internalize this effectively within the national agencies first, the \ndirections  leading  towards  the  OPIF  can  be  initiated  through  the  UBOM.  DBM  plans  to \nimplement the UBOM in all 81 provinces and 28 highly urbanized cities by 2010. \n \n30.  Gender and Development. Guidelines for the preparation of an annual gender and \ndevelopment plan and budget (Joint Circular No. 2004-1 by DBM, NEDA, and the National \nCommission on the Role of the Filipino Women) provide guidance on the identification of \ngender-responsive  programs,  activities,  and  projects  for  inclusion  in  agencies\u2019  gender  and \ndevelopment budgets (GAA mandates all departments and agencies to set aside at least 5% of \ntheir appropriations for projects that address gender issues), and the formulation of performance \nindicators that will form the bases for monitoring and evaluating the agencies\u2019 accomplishments \nand achievements on gender and development.20 \n \n31.  Procurement.  As  part  of  expenditure  management  reforms,  the  Government \nProcurement Reform Act (GPRA) was passed in 2003 to: (i) address the proliferation of laws on \npublic sector procurement, which facilitated rent-seeking and inefficiencies; (ii) reorganize and \nstrengthen agency and local government bids and award committees and procurement units; \nand (iii) strengthen the system of reward and punishment in the performance of the procurement \nfunction. Implementation of the GPRA has been intensified at the LGU level. The Government \nProcurement Policy Board of DBM has reported that 86% of all LGUs have implemented the law \nas of June 2007. To address problems that LGUs are still encountering in implementation of the \nGPRA, DBM will develop a manual for simplified procurement procedures for LGUs and a \nprocurement manual for barangays.  \n \n32.  Financial Reporting and Audit. COA is an independent constitutional body and the \nPhilippines\u2019 supreme audit institution. It has introduced a National Government Accounting \nSystem (NGAS) at all levels of the Government to simplify government accounting, conform to \ninternational  accounting  standards,  and  generate  periodic  financial  statements  for  better \nperformance monitoring. The audited statements of LGUs, in accordance with NGAS, need to \nbe made publicly available and accessible. BLGF is currently harmonizing its LGU financial \nreporting system for local treasurers\u2014the statement of receipts and expenditures (SRE)\u2014 with \nthe NGAS to achieve this. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 Sections 446, 457, and 467 of the LGC address gender participation by explicitly providing women representation \nin local councils at the three major subnational levels, although there are concerns regarding the quality of such \nparticipation. The advisory TA, Local Governance and Fiscal Management Project (footnote 5) and the TA on \nStrengthening Provincial and Local Planning and Expenditure Management (footnote 5) will be providing training to \nlocal development council members, including women, on participatory budget and planning process. \n ", "  13 \n4.  Lack of Effective Performance Measurement System \n \n33.  In recent years, there has been increased interest on the part of LGUs, government \nagencies, and international organizations in the assessment of LGU fiscal, financial, and service \ndelivery performance. In the past, many tools were developed to evaluate the performance of \nlocal governments, but most did not prove very effective or addressed only narrow concerns. \nThe  Local  Government  Performance  Measurement  System  (LGPMS)  of  DILG  is  the  most \npromising  initiative  to  date.  It  provides  LGUs  with  a  tool  to  assess  their  strengths  and \nweaknesses in the performance of their roles and responsibilities, and uses indicators derived \nlargely  from  the  LGC.  The  LGPMS  measures  performance  in  4  areas  (governance, \nadministration, social services, and economic development) by collecting data for 111 input and \noutput indicators in 17 service areas. Service areas to measure performance for governance \ninclude local legislation, transparency, and participation. Service areas to measure performance \nin  administration  include  revenue  generation,  resource  allocation  and  utilization,  financial \naccountability, customer service, and human resource management and development. Service \nareas  to  measure  performance  in  social  services  include  health  and  nutrition,  education, \nhousing and basic utilities, and peace, security, and disaster risk management. Service areas to \nmeasure performance in economic development include agriculture and fisheries development \nand entrepreneurship, business, and industry promotion. DILG has reported that the LGPMS \nhas been introduced in all LGUs in 2007. Although under implementation, DILG (in cooperation \nwith  DOF,  DBM,  and  NEDA)  is  continuously  fine-tuning  and  improving  the  LGPMS,  by \ndeveloping a framework for its use by executive agencies. 21 The LGPMS is a self-diagnostic \ntool for LGUs, which may lead to quality issues that clearly limit the usefulness of the data for \npurposes such as performance-based grant allocation. It is envisioned that, with greater comfort \nof LGUs, disaggregated data for each LGU will be made available in the medium term.  \n \n34.  BLGF is also setting up a database called the local government financial performance \nmonitoring system (LGFPMS). Currently, the LGFPMS is being linked to the LGPMS to allow \nintegration of financial data with development and service delivery data, and strengthen the \nlinkage between measuring outputs and allocating inputs. Out of the 16 LGFPMS indicators, 11 \nindicators  are  being  integrated  into  LGPMS.  These  indicators  are  revenue  target \naccomplishment rate, real property tax accomplishment rate, cost of collection rate, revenue per \ncapita, social expenditure ratio, economic expenditure ratio, personal services expenditure ratio, \ninternal financing ration, expenditures per capita, debt servicing ratio, and public enterprises \nprofitability rate.  \n \n5.  Lack of Access of LGUs to Development Credit Financing  \n \n35.  Credit financing is used by LGUs to support the development of infrastructure, capital \ninvestment, and a portion of operating expenses. Sources include domestic banks, GFIs, and \nloans through the Government from foreign sources. Although LGUs are empowered to borrow, \nthe LGC puts a ceiling on debt servicing which should not exceed 20% of their regular income. \nThe Government\u2019s long-term vision is for the capital market, rather than national agencies, to \nplay a dominant role in financing LGUs, although little progress has been made to end LGU \nreliance on GFIs, despite the initial adoption of the LGU financing framework (LFF) in 1996. \nPrivate lending is still not substantial. GFIs and the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) \ncontinue to be the dominant source of LGU financing, accounting for 76% (GFIs) and 7% \n(MDFO) of total LGU borrowing in 2006. GFIs have an advantage in the LGU credit market \n                                                 \n21 This will be considered under improvements to the LGPMS in the Local Governance and Fiscal Management \nProject (footnote 5) and the advisory TA.  \n ", "14 \nbecause of their role as LGU depository banks22 while MDFO has access to an IRA intercept \nmechanism in the event of a loan default. Private banks have indicated that the mandated use \nof GFIs as depository banks for LGUs is a significant structural impediment to their entry into the \nmarket  of  lending  to  LGUs.  This  is  compounded  by  lack  of  reliable  information  on  LGU \ncreditworthiness. Nonetheless, the pool of potential LGU bond issuers has slowly grown, as \nspecific LGUs develop a firm financial foundation. This was facilitated by the creation of the \nLocal Government Unit Guarantee Corporation, which guarantees debt issues of LGUs from \nprivate sources.  \n \n36.  Recent  Developments.  In  February  2007,  DOF  issued  a  memorandum  officially \nadopting the LFF and the Government\u2019s cost-sharing arrangement, and clarifying a number of \nissues. The memorandum explicitly states that provision of credit to LGUs by the Government \nwill be governed \u201cthrough a policy of market segmentation, hand-in-hand with the policy to \ngraduate creditworthy LGUs to private sources of capital\u201d. MDFO is also commissioning a study \nto develop a framework for allowing LGUs to open depository accounts in private banks. The \nframework will improve access of LGUs to private capital markets while taking into consideration \nthe implications this will have on GFIs and the moral hazard problems that may arise from \nallowing private banks open access to LGU financial accounts. Under the Local Government \nFinance  and  Development  (LOGOFIND)  project  and  the  Community-Based  Resource \nManagement (CBRM) project, MDFO is lending to third to sixth income class LGUs for urban \ninfrastructure, health, and environmental projects. In addition, the P2 billion program-policy \nlending facility (PROLEND), which provides provinces with a program loan for pursuing policy \nreforms, and the P500 million MDG fund have been launched in 2007. Both these facilities will \nbe financed through the second-generation fund of MDFO.  \n \n6.  Inadequate Local Own-Source Revenues and Inefficient Tax Administration \n \n37.  The estimated own-source revenue of sub national governments as percentage of total \nLGU revenue is 31.1 percent, the highest in the region (for Thailand it is 10.9% and for Vietnam \nit is <5%).23 In the Philippines, tax revenues accounted for 25% of total LGU income in 2006. \nHowever, studies have shown that LGUs have created revenue codes with a huge array of \ntaxes, fees, and charges.24 Many of these are under-collected or not collected at all. In addition, \nmany low yielding taxes impose substantial collection and administrative costs and contribute to \na lack of transparency. For example, taxes on peddlers, fishing vessels, and radio fees, each \nbring in an average of no more than 0.02% of LGUs\u2019 total own-source revenue. In Bacolod City, \nthere are over 200 different rates for the mayor\u2019s business permit fee, all of which depend on \nthe type of establishment. There is a need to focus on taxes, fees, and charges that have high \nyield potential, and to improve their administration and collection.  \n \n38.  Although LGUs have greater taxation powers under the LGC, local governments face \ndisincentives to improve collections because of lack of critical tax information and inconsistent \nfinancial policy guidelines. LGUs are authorized to levy business taxes as a percentage of the \ngross sales of businesses. To remedy this, the LGU Leagues have actively lobbied BIR for \nimplementation of Section 171, which requires BIR\u2019s revenue district offices to share their tax \ninformation with the local treasurer. However, this has met with resistance from BIR which \n                                                 \n22 GFIs do not have an IRA intercept mechanism to protect against default. They protect themselves through a \u201cback-\nto-back\u201d agreement by requiring LGUs to sign an agreement that authorizes the GFI lender, in the event of a \ndefault for payment of interest and amortization of principal, to debit the LGUs\u2019 IRA depository account in the GFI.  \n23 World Bank. 2005. East Asia Decentralizes. Washington, DC. \n24 This can be attributed to the Code itself. Section 143, Tax on Business, has a very detailed schedule of fees that \ncan be simplified.  \n ", "  15 \nconsiders this to be in conflict with tax information secrecy provisions. The policy environment \nrelating to LGU tax administration also needs to be improved. Some implementing regulations \non local taxation are not favorable to all LGUs. Key among this is the guideline for taxation of \nbank branches in favor of the head office, and hence the LGU hosting the head office.25 The \ncurrent interpretation of the relevant LGC provision has caused the bulk of the bank\u2019s revenues \nto be posted to the head office\u2014causing the bank branches, usually in less wealthy LGUs, to \nface a lower basis for imposition of their business tax.  \n \n39.  DOF is currently reviewing sets of instructions, which will have a significant impact on \nthe  taxation  powers  and  capacity  of  LGUs.  The  first  is  a  draft  EO  that  will  implement \nSection 171 of the Code on the sharing of tax information between BIR and LGUs. The second \nis an amendment to Local Finance Circular 1-93 that will require banks to reflect sharing of their \ngross  sales,  in  terms  of  amount  of  loans  approved,  at  the  bank  branch  where  the  loan \napplication originated. This will increase the gross sales of these branches and give LGUs \nhigher revenue on which to base their business tax. The third is the local finance circular, which \nwill guide LGUs in the imposition of business taxes on mining projects. Local tax administration \nis severely inadequate in many LGUs. This is highlighted by the declining trend in the collection \nefficiency of real property tax (RPT) of both provinces and cities in the post-Code period \n(Appendix 5, Table A5.5). Consequently, the contribution of LGUs to total government revenues \n(central Government and LGUs combined) remains low\u2014an average of 7.1% in 1992\u20132005 \ncompared to 4.9% in 1985\u20131991 (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Share of National and Subnational Governments to  \nGeneral Government Revenue (%) \n   Total Revenues     Tax     Non-Tax \nYear  GG  NG  LG     GG  NG  LG     GG  NG  LG \nAverage                        \n1985\u20131991  100.0  95.1  4.9    100.0  96.1  3.9    100.0  90.9    9.1 \n1992\u20132005  100.0  92.9  7.1    100.0  93.8  6.2    100.0  87.4  12.6 \n1985\u20132003  100.0  93.4  6.6    100.0  94.2  5.8    100.0  88.1  11.9 \nGG = general government, NG = national government, LG = local government. \nSource: Commission on Audit, Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n40.  LGU  tax  administration  is  weighed  down  by  three  overarching  deficiencies:  (i)  low \nprofessional qualifications of staff, (ii) inadequate automation of core tasks, and (iii) weaknesses \nin supporting policies at the national government level.26 The low capacity of LGU tax staff is \nmanifested by inadequate cash controls, weak internal audit, absence of effective management, \nand lack of independent oversight. Some LGUs are investing in information technology (IT) to \nimprove assessment and collection of RPT and business fees, but for a majority it remains an \nexpensive proposition. National government bodies or local government associations, such as \nthe League of Municipalities, have not explored adoption of a common IT platform for tax or \nlicensing. In addition, the LGC is not completely consistent with local autonomy criteria. While \nboosting local tax authority, it also constrains local revenue collection through rules on rates, \nassessments, appeals and administrative responsibilities\u2014leaving LGUs little control over one \n                                                 \n25 Department of Finance. 1993.

Capacity Development in Resource Mobilization. BLGF has a critical role to play in \nproviding technical support to LGUs in local finance and local tax administration. Its ongoing \nefforts include important areas such as: (i) establishing an LGU financial, fiscal, and debt \nmonitoring system to make information available to the public; (ii) developing and disseminating \na manual on various modalities for LGU finance; (iii) developing and disseminating a manual on \ngood LGU debt management and a manual of operations for computing and establishing LGU \ndebt service and borrowing capacity; (iv) reviewing the consistency of various local tax rulings; \n(v)  harmonizing  the  SRE  manual  with  the  NGAS;  and  (vi)  updating  the  Local  Treasurer\u2019s \nManual.  MDFO  is  also  providing  substantial  capacity  development  support  and  training  in \nstandardized project financing and other areas of resource mobilization. As of June 2007, \nMDFO had conducted 2,551 training programs for 513 LGUs in resource mobilization and \nupdating of local revenue code. To encourage LGUs to improve RPT collection, MDFO has \nprovided a credit window for such improvements as part of their project. In an effort to improve \nRPT collection, BLGF has developed valuation standards as part of their Assessor\u2019s Manual for \ncode of ethics, mass appraisal, and market values as valuation basis. It is also providing training \nin RPT valuation standards and collection. \n \n42.  Recent Issues Advocated by the LGU Leagues. Since 1999, the LGU Leagues have \nbeen actively advocating to the Government their concerns on the IRA\u2014including its automatic \nrelease, deductions which were outside the Codal formula, and its automatic appropriation. As a \nresult, the Supreme Court ruled in their favor on the first two issues. In 2006, the legislature and \nthe executive closed the remaining IRA issue by passing a law on the automatic appropriation of \nthe IRA. Currently, the LGU Leagues are advocating more transparent and timely release of \ntheir shares in national wealth. Through the PDF, the LGU Leagues have also raised a number \nof issues related to the improvement of own-source revenues. They presented position papers \non sharing of tax information by BIR with LGUs, the situs of tax on bank branches, and situs of \ntax on mining firms.  \n \nC.  Lessons  \n43.  International development work on decentralization and local governance in the last two \ndecades has generated an extensive database of knowledge and practical experience from \nwhich  a  number  of  lessons  were  considered  while  designing  the  LGFBR  program.  These \ninclude the following. 29 \n \n(i)  Sustainability. A  major decentralization challenge is long-term sustainability. \nProgram design should therefore embody sustained support over a period, with \nexit strategies and plans for up-scaling or institutionalizing program activities. The \nadopted phased approach imparts flexibility to the LGFBR program to exit or \nupscale as the reform situation warrants.  \n(ii)  Central  Government  commitment. Implementation of decentralization is not \nalways  supported  by  top-level  central  government  commitment.  Programs  of \nsupport  should  be  holistic,  taking  into  consideration  the  interrelationships \n                                                 \n27  United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 1999.

The LGFBR program involves the \nnational  oversight  agencies  and  strives  to  institutionalize  a  coordination \nmechanism to deal with decentralization issues on a regular basis. \n(iii)  Donor coordination. To ensure more effective coordination between donors and \npartner  governments,  joint  government-donor  forums  may  be  established  for \nimplementing reforms and information sharing. PDF provides a joint forum for \ngovernment and development partners, from which the LGFBR program has \nbenefited.  \n(iv)  Fiscal  decentralization  support.  Programs  designed  to  improve  financial \nmanagement (e.g., planning, budgeting, accounting) have been more successful \nthan other fundamental improvements. Program design should take into account \nreforms  of  local  tax  systems,  assignments,  types  of  taxes,  and  tax  sharing \narrangements.  The  LGFBR  program  includes  measures  to  strengthen  these \nareas. \n \n44.  The reforms proposed under the LGFBR have also drawn substantially from the two \nmajor joint reports of the Government, ADB, and the World Bank.30 These include: (i) enhancing \nLGU ability and capacity to access resources; (ii) strengthening key resource management \nprocesses relating to planning, budgeting, procurement, and financial management; (iii) raising \nLGU access to credit by private financial institutions; (iv) policy actions to improve business \ntaxes  and  RPT;  and  (v) review  of  the  institutional  arrangements  for  generating  consensus \namong stakeholders on managing the decentralization process. The LGFBR program has made \ndeliberate attempts to analyze political economy factors in LGU capacity development and \nchange management, and to keep the reform expectations realistic.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n45.  Given the many issues facing the Philippine LGU sector, a focused and consolidated \nprogram is required to respond to them. The Program must first help ensure the availability of \nresources. The LGFBR Program (i) facilitates an augmented, dependable, and timely flow of \nresources that the LGUs are legally entitled to as well as facilitating other means of financing \nthrough public and private channels; (ii) facilitates local revenue generation; (iii) addresses the \ncapacity  development  needs  of  LGUs  in  planning,  expenditure  management,  and  efficient \nprocurement for better service delivery; and (iv) improves monitoring systems by making the \nfinancial and service delivery performance of LGUs more transparent.

The objective of the proposed LGFBR Program is to support the Government in its \nefforts to help LGUs develop enhanced capacities to plan and budget for the general welfare of \ntheir constituent communities in a transparent and accountable way. The LGFBR Program \ncontributes to improved efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of basic public services to \nresidents by increasing fiscal resources and financing options for LGUs. The intended impact is \nachieved  by  strengthening  the  policy,  financing,  financial,  and  regulatory  framework  for \n ", "  19 \ndecentralization  as  well  as  developing  capacities  at  the  local  government  level.  This  is \nsupported by a series of action-oriented policy reform measures undertaken by the Government \nand TA targeting the national oversight agencies.   \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s Contribution to Subprogram 1 Core Policy Actions. ADB has contributed \nsignificantly to the achievement of the subprogram 1 core policy actions by working with the \nGovernment in a concerted manner since 2006. The automatic appropriation of the LGU\u2019s IRA, \nposting of the PDAF, and improvements in the release of the LGU special shares supports the \npolicy of increased transparency in budget releases that started with the DPSP. TA 455631 \nassisted in computerization and implementation of the SRE, revision of the Assessor\u2019s Manual \nwith new valuation standards, integration of the LGPMS with LGFPMS, and training of LGUs in \nstandardized project financing. TA 451232 supported development and training on the provincial \nguidelines, which is NEDA\u2019s contribution to the JMC. TA 468633 provided the LGUs with a \ngeneric procurement manual and training in its use. TA 477834 is helping in the implementation \nof the LGU special shares, reviewing the LGC, improving the UBOM, developing a simplified \nbarangay procurement manual and providing training in participatory budgeting.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n48.  Program Cluster Modality. The Program is structured in sequential subprograms under \nthe  program  cluster  modality  with:  (i)  two  single  tranche  operations  (subprogram  1: \nJanuary 2006\u2013December 2007; subprogram 2: January 2008\u2013December 2010), with a well-\ndefined, medium-term framework specified at the outset, including completed reforms prior to \nBoard consideration under subprogram 1; and (ii) expected prior actions for subprogram 2 to \nensure a continuous dialogue with the Government. Subprogram 2 will be further formulated \nduring the subprogram review to allow flexibility to adjust the Program based on progress made \nand changes in the external environment. This does not obligate ADB to additional lending for \nsubprogram 2, which will be subject to Board approval. Specifically, the LGFBR Program will \nsupport government reforms in the following five policy areas: \n(i)  Intergovernmental fiscal relations. Improving completeness, timeliness, and \ntransparency in the release of LGU shares in national government revenues and \ngrants. The policy area will enable LGUs to increase the ratio of shared taxes in \nlocal revenues. \n(ii)  Fiscal management, planning, and public expenditure management. The \npolicy area will contribute to improved transparency and accountability at the \nLGU level.  \n(iii)  Performance measurement and service delivery. The policy area will enable \nLGUs to ensure effectiveness and transparency in the delivery of critical public \nservices.   \n(iv)  Credit financing. The policy area will contribute to improved LGU access to \npublic  and  private  sources  of  capital  for  financing  of  policy  reforms  and \ndevelopment projects.  \n(v)  Local own source revenues. The policy area will help develop local sources of \nrevenues and reduce LGU dependency on the IRA. \n \n \n                                                 \n31  Local Government Finance and Budget Reform Project (footnote 5). \n32  Strengthening Provincial and Local Planning and Expenditure Management (footnote 5). \n33  Harmonization and Managing for Results (footnote 5). \n34  Local Governance and Fiscal Management Project (footnote 5). \n ", "20 \n1.   Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations  \n49.  The LGFBR supports the Government\u2019s reforms in intergovernmental fiscal relations. \nThe policy area contributes to improved completeness, timeliness, and transparency in the \nrelease of LGU shares in national government revenues. This is achieved by: (i) improving the \ncompleteness and transparency in the release of the IRA; and (ii) improving the release of \nspecial shares in national wealth such as mining taxes, tax on energy resources, forestry \ncharges, and mining royalties. First, Republic Act 9358 passed in 2006 provides for automatic \nappropriation of the IRA from 2007. The predictability and transparency in the release of the IRA \nis ensured by timely estimation and certification of the IRA share for 2008 in 2007 by BIR, and \ndistribution of the LBM to LGUs by June of every year announcing their IRA share for the \ncoming year. The IRA share of each of the 43,704 local governments will be in line with the \nformula prescribed in the LGC and posted on the DBM website on an annual basis. In addition, \nthe releases of the PDAF are also being posted on the website. As a result of these measures, \nthe LGUs have received P161 billion as IRA for 2006 and are expected to receive P183 billion in \n2007. The posting of fund release information on the website has two objectives: (i) to reduce \nuncertainty in fiscal planning at the local level, and (ii) to inform citizens the amount each LGU is \nreceiving from the Government.  \n50.  Second, the release of LGU special shares in national wealth and other taxes will be \nimproved by instituting a more effective and efficient process for estimation of tax collection and \nschedule of release of income shares. Under this policy area, the LGFBR Program supports \nissuance and implementation of Joint Circular 2006-1 which will streamline the release of LGU\u2019s \nspecial shares in the proceeds from the development and utilization of national wealth in mining, \nforestry,  energy  and  mining  royalties.  Initially  this  issuance  has  reduced  the  documentary \nrequirements for the release of these shares from 5 to 2.  \n  2.   Fiscal Management, Planning, and Public Expenditure Management \n \n51.  The  LGFBR  Program  supports  enhanced  efficiency  and  accountability  in  fiscal \nmanagement,  planning,  and  budget  management  at  the  local  level;  and  coordination  of \noversight functions and capacity development measures among national government agencies. \nThis addresses the need to increase the overall efficiency of public expenditure, given the limits \nof  tax  effort.  Actions  to  achieve  this  include:  (i)  streamlining  the  oversight  and  capacity \ndevelopment functions of key government agencies in LGU fiscal management, planning, and \npublic expenditure management; (ii) improving the fiscal management capacity of LGUs by \nensuring that the SRE financial reporting system is fully implemented; and (iii) improving the \nimplementation of the GPRA at the local level.  \n52.  The  LGFBR  Program  supports  reforms  under  this  policy  area  by  facilitating \nimplementation of JMC 1 on harmonization of local planning, investment programming, revenue \nadministration, budgeting, and expenditure management; introduction of the UBOM to LGUs \nand training for at least 90% of all provinces, cities and municipalities; completion of the local \nAssessor\u2019s  manual;  dissemination  of  the  provincial  planning  guidelines  to  all  provinces; \nintroduction of the NGAS-harmonized SRE; providing 2,551 training programs for 513 LGUs in \nstandardized project financing; completion and distribution of the debt management manual;  \ntraining  of  86%  of  provinces,  cities  and  municipalities  in  the  GPRA;  implementation  of  a \nsimplified procurement manual for LGUs and preparation of a barangay procurement manual.  \n \n \n ", "  21 \n3.  Performance Measurement and Service Delivery \n \n53.  The LGFBR Program supports the Government\u2019s agenda to enhance effectiveness and \ntransparency in the delivery of critical public services. Action taken to achieve this includes: \n(i) enhancing financing options for improved service delivery in urban infrastructure, health, \nenvironment, and rural and agricultural services; and by adopting a mechanism that rewards \nbetter  fiscal  performance;  (ii)  improving  implementation  of  devolved  functions  by \ninstitutionalizing a coordination body at the national level to address recurrent and future issues \non  decentralization;  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  existing  LGU  performance \nmonitoring systems by improving quality and transparency.  \n \n54.  The LGFBR Program will support improved access of at least 217 third to sixth income \nclass LGUs, to development credit aimed at improving local service delivery through investment \nin urban infrastructure and public services\u2014with loans amounting to P2.25 billion; provision of \ncredit for health and agricultural services projects; establishment of the CCD;35 development of \na framework for performance-based grants; coverage of all provinces, cities, and municipalities \nby  the  LGPMS;  integration  of  the  LGFPMS  with  the  LGPMS;  and  public  disclosure  of \nperformance data.   \n  4.  Credit Financing \n \n55.  The LGFBR Program supports the Government\u2019s agenda to improve LGU access to \npublic sources of credit for financing policy reforms and development projects and access to \nprivate sources of capital for higher income LGUs and selected income-generating projects. \nActions taken to achieve this include: (i) improving access to private sources of financing by \nrelaxing policy and legal constraints that prevent LGUs from becoming borrowers of private \nfunds; (ii) increasing the availability of development financing and rationalizing the market for \nLGU financing by channeling limited resources of national government direct lending to areas \nwhich  the private  sector  may  not  finance, such  as social  services;  and  (iii)  improving  the \nfinancial  information  system  on  LGUs  to  facilitate  the  private  sector\u2019s  ability  to  gauge  the \ncreditworthiness of potential borrowers. \n56.  Under this policy area, the LGFBR Program will support policy guidelines that increase \nLGU access to private sources of capital, such as allowing institutional investors to hold bonds \nto comply with their reserve requirements, allowing private banks to act as trustee banks for a \nmunicipal bond float, and approval of the LFF as a national policy. Additionally, the LGBFR \nProgram will support refinement of the LGU grant-loan mix in support of lower income LGUs \nand  social  projects;  increased  funding  for  credit  facilities  for  policy  reform  such  as  the \nPROLEND  to  P2 billion;  emphasis  on  meeting  MDGs  by  providing  a  financing  window \namounting to P500 million; credit windows for local service delivery in key sectors such as \nhealth, education, and environment; a credit program amounting to $83.75 million for LGU \nurban infrastructure, with a grant amounting to 20% of the total project cost subject to the \nattainment of tax collection targets; and investment in improving the creditworthiness of LGUs \nby implementing the SRE. \n   \n \n                                                 \n35 There is continuous interest and advocacy for amending some LGC provisions. Initiatives emanating from LGU \nLeagues, NGOs, and civil society groups have resulted in omnibus bills such as Candazo in 1999 (Congress) and \nPimentel (Senate) in 2000 seeking to amend specific provisions such as the IRA share of LGUs, or local taxation. \nThe CCD will be well positioned when the political environment becomes more conducive to amending the Code.  \n ", "22 \n  5.  Local Own-Source Revenues \n \n57.  The objective of this policy area is to help the Government reduce LGU dependency on \nthe IRA by developing buoyant sources of local revenues. Actions needed to achieve this \ninclude:  (i)  enhancing  LGU  ability  to  generate  revenues  from  local  business  taxes,  and \n(ii) improving  collection  of  RPT.  Under  this  policy  area,  the  LGFBR  Program  will  support \nissuance of the EO requiring BIR to share its tax information with LGUs; prompt revisions in \ninterpretation of Situs of Tax Rule for Banks under Local Government Circular 1-93; provide \ncredit financing for improvements in business tax enhancement for 11 LGUs; provide credit \nfacility to 60 LGUs for increased collection of RPT; training of at least 1,002 LGUs in resource \nmobilization,  improvements  in  valuation  standards  for  mass  appraisal,  market  values,  and \nequipment and machinery; and training in the new valuation standards for 1,406 LGUs. \n \nC.  LGFBR Medium Term Program: Subprogram 2 Indicative Policy Actions \n58.  The  LGFBR  Program  sets  out  the  Government\u2019s  LGU  reform  agenda  for  the  next \n3 years, building on the reform momentum of subprogram 1. Indicative policy actions or the \ntriggers for subprogram 2 are described in Appendix 3. The milestones to be monitored for \nsubprogram 2 are listed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n1.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations \n \n59.  Improve Completeness, Timeliness, and Transparency in the Release of the IRA \nand PDAF. There are two policy triggers for the second subprogram. For the first trigger, the \nGovernment, through DBM, will complete the timely release of the IRA share of LGUs as \ncertified by BIR for the 2007 IRA. The amount of P183 billion will be verified in the first quarter of \n2008. For the second trigger, the Government, through DBM, will distribute to LGUs the LBM for \nindicative IRA for the ensuing budget year by June of the current year beginning 2008. The \nprovision of this information to LGUs will improve local budgeting and lend greater transparency \nto the entire process of intergovernmental fiscal relations.  \n \n60.  Improve Release of LGUs\u2019 Special Shares in National Wealth. The Government will \nstreamline the process for releasing LGUs\u2019 shares in mining taxes by BIR (as collecting agent) \nand  DBM  (as  disbursing  agent).  In  the  medium  term,  the  Government  is  committed  to \nstreamlining the release of LGUs\u2019 other special shares in national wealth\u2014energy resources \nand forestry charges.  \n \n2.  Fiscal Management, Planning, and Public Expenditure Management \n \n61.  Streamline  the  Oversight  and  Capacity  Development  Functions  of  National \nGovernment Agencies. There are two policy triggers for the second subprogram. For the first \ntrigger,  the  Government  through  BLGF,  will  complete  and  distribute  the  Local  Treasurer\u2019s \nManual to all provinces, cities and municipalities. For the second trigger, the Government, \nthrough NEDA, will ensure that provinces prepare the Provincial Development and Physical \nFramework  Plan  and  Provincial  Development  Investment  Program  using  the  guidelines  on \nprovincial/local  planning  and  expenditure  management.  These  policy  triggers  will  not  only \nensure compliance with the coordinated framework of the JMC over the medium term but will \nimprove the fiscal capacity of provinces, cities and municipalities and enhance the planning \ncapacity of provinces.  \n \n ", "  23 \n62.  Improve Fiscal Management Capacity of LGUs. There are two policy triggers for the \nsecond subprogram. For the first trigger, the Government, through BLGF, will fully implement \nthe SRE financial reporting system by all provinces, cities, and municipalities. This is expected \nto improve local financial reporting and make available the financial information about LGUs to \npotential  private  creditors  and  the  private  sector  as  a  whole.  For  the  second  trigger,  the \nGovernment, through BLGF, will complete and implement the Competency Certification System \nfor local treasurers. This will standardize a benchmark for evaluating the performance of local \ntreasurers and make their skills marketable.  \n \n3.  Performance Measurement and Service Delivery \n \n63.  Enhance Financing Options to Improve Service Delivery in Key Sectors. There are \nthree policy triggers for the second subprogram. For the first policy trigger, the Government, \nthrough MDFO, will facilitate at least 250 LGUs to avail of loan financing for improved service \ndelivery through investment in environment and health related projects. This trigger focuses on \nhealth and environmental management. For the second policy trigger, the Government through \nMDFO, will complete a study on performance-based grants that will be used to develop a \nframework  for  a  performance-based  system  for  LGUs.  For  the  third  policy  trigger,  the \nGovernment through MDFO, will adopt the framework for a performance-based grant system for \nLGUs in a future financing window. This framework will provide a performance component to the \ncredit  financing  operations  of  MDFO  and  institute  greater  appreciation  among  LGUs  for \nimproving performance in local service delivery.  \n \n4.  Credit Financing \n \n64.  Increase LGU Access to Private Financing. The Government, through DOF, will issue \nguidelines for allowing LGUs to open depository accounts in private banks. The LFF supports \nthe graduation of LGUs to private sources of capital, and allowing LGUs to open depository \naccounts in private banks is consistent with this policy position. In the medium term, LGUs will \nbe able to establish a genuine borrower-creditor relationship with private banks, which will result \nin direct access to their loanable funds.  \n \n65.  Increased Availability of Development Financing for LGUs. There are three policy \ntriggers for the second subprogram. In the first trigger, the Government will, through MDFO, \nenable at least 10 LGUs to avail of PROLEND loans. This trigger builds on the first subprogram \nby increasing the funding for this policy-based window to P2 billion. In the second policy trigger, \nMDFO will make available loans through its MDG window to 50 LGUs. This trigger builds on the \nfirst subprogram by creating a financing window for projects to help achieve MDGs at the local \nlevel. In the medium term, improved achievement of policy reforms is expected in the provinces \nand  their  component  cities  and  municipalities,  by  improved  delivery  of  services  for  the \nattainment of MDGs. In the third policy trigger, MDFO will develop a Disaster Calamity Fund to \nprovide an immediate source of financing to LGUs hit by calamities.  \n \n66.  Improved Availability of Financial Information on LGUs.  There is one policy trigger \nfor the second subprogram. The Government, through BLGF, will complete and issue the \nRevised Income Classification System for LGUs. This policy trigger will improve provision of \nfinancial information available to private investors and increase private sector confidence in \nLGUs as borrowers leading to increased local investment. \n \n \n \n ", "24 \n5.  Local Own-Source Revenues \n \n67.  Enhance LGUs\u2019 Ability to Generate Revenues from Local Business Taxes. There \nare two triggers for the second subprogram. Firstly, the Government will, through DOF and BIR, \nissue guidelines and instructions for the BIR regional offices for sharing tax information with \nLGUs. In the medium term, this trigger will improve LGU information about the sales of firms in \ntheir  jurisdictions\u2014providing  an  accurate  basis  for  imposition  of  business  tax,  resulting  in \nincreased collections. Secondly, the Government will, through DOF, issue guidelines on the \nsitus of the tax rule for mining firms in levying local business tax. This trigger will allow LGUs to \nlevy business taxes on mining operations in their localities which, in the medium term, will result \nin increased business tax collections.  \n \n68.  Improve Collection of RPT. There are two triggers for the second subprogram. Firstly, \nthe Government will, through BLGF, issue valuation standards for equipment and machinery as \npart  of  an  addendum  to  the  Local  Assessor\u2019s  Manual.  Secondly,  BLGF  will  train  at  least \n70 LGUs in valuation standards. This will improve LGU capacity to levy RPT and improve \ncollections in the medium term.  \n  \nD.  Important Features \n69.  The  LGFBR  program  has  a  number  of  distinct  features.  First,  it  is  an  appropriate \ninstrument  for  strengthening  ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  the  Government.  By  basing  financial \nassistance on completed actions derived from the Government\u2019s own reform program; LGFBR \noffers  a  way  to  strengthen  Government\u2019s  ownership  of  the  strategies  of  its  development \npartners. By including policy triggers and milestone actions for subprogram 2, it creates a \nvehicle for broad-based dialogue for the Government\u2019s agenda. Second, the LGFBR program \nhelps  establish  an  institutional  mechanism  to  achieve  better  interagency  coordination  and \nimplementation of reforms. Third, the program cluster approach used is a useful tool for the \nlocal financing and governance program as pursued by LGFBR, laying out a comprehensive \nand rather complex set of reforms that need to be properly sequenced in line with political \nexpectations  and  taking  into  account  the  prevalent  fiscal  reality.  A  single-tranche  program \ncluster approach gives more flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances within the longer \nterm cluster concept, while focusing on achievable, upfront outcomes. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n70.  The Government has requested a loan of \u00a534,253,100,000 ($300,000,000 equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1 of the LGFBR program. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum.36 The Government has made its own \nindependent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an \nundertaking  that  this  choice  was  not  made  on  the  basis  of  any  advice  from  ADB.  The \nGovernment envisages that a loan of $300,000,000 will be needed to finance subprogram 2, the \nloan amount to be confirmed at the time of loan processing in 2010. The loan for subprogram 1 \nwill be released in one tranche upon meeting the conditions of the policy matrix. Prior to the \nprocessing of subprogram 2, the Government will have demonstrated satisfactory progress with \nimplementation of subprogram 1. \n                                                 \n36  ADB\u2019s Board of Directors has discounted the commitment charge to 0.25%, and waived the front-end fee of 1.00% \nfor loans approved from 1 July 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008. \n ", "  25 \n71.  The  program  loan  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government \n(Table 5).  According  to  DOF  budget  reports,  the  gross  financing  (external  and  domestic) \nrequirements for 2007 are P390 billion. Based on the Government\u2019s debt strategy for 2007 (the \nexpected disbursement period for subprogram 1) the DOF projects gross external borrowings at \nP131 billion ($2.59 billion). The Government\u2019s debt management strategy is to diversify its \nliability portfolio by increasing the weight given to domestic debt financing, lengthening the debt \nmaturity  profile,  and  maximizing  overseas  development  assistance  financing.  ADB  staff \nassessment of debt sustainability indicates that the Government\u2019s debt stock and strategy are \nsustainable over the medium term, provided fiscal consolidation remains on track. The LGFBR \nproposed loan amount of $300 million equivalent will help to close the financing gap for 2007. \n \nTable 5: Government of the Philippines Projected Financing Requirements for 2007  \nFinancing Mix in 2007  Proposed Amounts in 2007 ($) \nGross Financing Requirements   7,760.00 million \nLess Amortization  6,030.00 million \nNet Financing Requirement  1,730.00 million \nProgrammed Gross External Borrowings  2,590.00 million \nof which:   \nADB\u2019s proposed loan pipeline    586.00 million \nDPSP   250.00 million \nIntegrated Coastal Development    36.00 million \nLGFBR   300.00 million \nOther donor  and commercial borrowings         1,670.00 million \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPSP = Development Policy Support Program, LGFBR = Local Government \nFinancing and Budget Reform. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = P46. \nSources: Department of Finance and ADB. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n72.  DOF will be the Executing Agency and responsible for the overall implementation of \nsubprogram  1\u2014including  complying  with  all  policy  actions,  program  administration, \ndisbursements, and maintenance of all program records. An LGFBR program  coordination \ncommittee (the Committee) has been established, chaired by the undersecretary of DOF and \ncomprising officials from BLGF, MDFO, DILG, DBM, and NEDA. The Committee is responsible \nfor coordinating the implementation of LGFBR program policy actions with agencies supporting \nthe  Program.  The  Committee  meets  quarterly  to  monitor  the  progress  and  oversee  the \nimplementation of the Program. ADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an \nobserver. DOF will be responsible for program implementation activities and will report progress \nto ADB. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n73.  The subprogram 1 period is from January 2006 to 31 December 2007. All actions \nincluded in the policy matrix have been implemented within this period. The Government and \nADB  will  prepare  a  completion  report  for  subprogram  1  by  June  2008,  which,  subject  to \nsubprogram 2 being approved, will be used as part of the overall program completion report. \n \n \n \n \n ", "26 \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n \n74.  The  loan  of  \u00a534,253,100,000  ($300  million  equivalent)  will  be  released  in  a  single \ntranche upon effectiveness (i.e., all conditions in the subprogram 1 policy matrix in Appendix 3 \nmust be satisfactorily complied with prior to release of the tranche). The loan proceeds will be \nused to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items,  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,37 the \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the \nBorrower. Under this Program, the Government will certify that the value of total imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made under \nother official development assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed \nduring the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Disbursements will be made under the simplified \nprocedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. LGFBR 1 will provide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by \nthe Government 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. The borrower has been informed that the \napproval in principle of the retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance this Program. \n \n  4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n75.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the Program. \n76.  For the purposes of this program, an assessment of the country's financial management \nsystems has been carried out to determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements. The diagnostic \nassessments were based on the Philippines Public Expenditures, Procurement, and Financial \nManagement Review 200338 led by the World Bank with the participation of ADB. The World \nBank, with the participation of ADB and the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAid), also produced the latest series of the Public Expenditure Review and Public Financial \nManagement (PFM) Performance Report, which applied the Public Expenditure and Financial \nAccountability framework in assessing the country\u2019s PFM systems, processes, and institutions. \nDiscussions  with  the  Government  during  formulation  of  the  LGFBRP  have  taken  into \n                                                 \n37 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n38  ADB and World Bank. 2003. A Public Expenditure, Procurement and Financial Management Review. Washington, \nDC. \n ", "  27 \nconsideration the ongoing reforms identified by these diagnostics. Based on this assessment, \nthe fiduciary arrangements for the Program are deemed satisfactory. \n \n77.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  a  balanced  budget  by  2008  and  an  improved \nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework for the 2007 budget preparation represents meaningful \nprogress on PFM reforms. The first paper on budget strategy, linking policy priorities and budget \nallocations, was prepared for the 2007 budget call. This resulted in earmarking allocable funds \nto  high  priority  health,  infrastructure,  and  education  sectors.  The  Government  has  piloted \nagency performance measures through the OPIF in 20 departments for the 2007 budget call; \nthe  OPIF  links  financial  inputs  with  performance  outputs.  This  is  hand  in  hand  with \nrationalization  of  the  Government\u2019s  compensation  system  and  eventual  introduction  of \nperformance-based salaries. DBM is also managing a program requiring rationalization plans \nfrom departments to eliminate redundant activities. An empowered Government Procurement \nPolicy Board is overseeing implementation of the GPRA to ensure transparency, efficiency, and \naccountability at the national and local level. Bids and awards committees are functioning in \neach agency, complaint mechanisms have been defined, and posting of invitation and awards \non the website is mandated. DBM has trained 86% LGUs on the GPRA; and completed the \nsimplified  procurement  manual  for  provinces,  cities,  municipalities,  and  barangays.  The \nGovernment has also launched a National Anti-Corruption Program of Action and addressed \nsome key areas, such as strengthening the Office of the Ombudsman, establishing anti-graft \nunits in many government agencies, and lifestyle checks on civil servants. Many LGFBR policy \nactions are cascading the PFM reforms to the LGUs by linking LGU planning and budgeting to \nhigher levels of the Government.  \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n78.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open a deposit account with the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) to \nreceive  the  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n79.  In coordination with the Committee, ADB will carry out periodic reviews of the progress \nof implementation and assess the impact of the LGFBR Program. The Government will keep \nADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies \nthat have implications for LGFBR implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB will, in collaboration with the Committee, \nundertake a review of program performance 12 months after loan effectiveness to review the \noutcome of subprogram 1 and prepare for subprogram 2.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n80.  In connection with the LGFBR Program, the Government has asked ADB for an advisory \nTA (ADTA) grant. The TA is estimated to cost a total of $1,100,000, of which ADB will finance \n$800,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe TA will support the development of a medium-term reform agenda in local government \nfinancing and governance and its implementation, as well as provide the Government with just-\nin-time policy advice. It will include the following areas: (i) support creation and functioning of a \nCCD  to  promote,  coordinate,  and  oversee  decentralization  reforms,  including  the  changes \n ", "28 \nenvisaged in the LGFBR program policy matrix; (ii) analysis of existing capacities for planning \nand budget management at city level, development and pilot testing of revised planning and \nbudgeting  systems,  and  preparation  and  dissemination  of  city  planning  guidelines;  and \n(iii) development  of  the  LGPMS  to  be  used  as  a  tool  to  link  access  to  intergovernmental \ntransfers, grants, and capacity development support with service delivery performance. The TA \ncomponents and cost estimates are described in Appendix 8. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impact \n81.  The LGFBR will provide significant benefits and will have a positive impact on local \nservice delivery, financing, and governance issues. The key expected benefits are: \n \n(i)  streamlined  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  as  a  result  of  completeness, \ntimeliness,  and  transparency  in  the  release  and  reporting  of  LGU  shares  in \nnational  government  revenues,  thereby  improving  the  accuracy  of  local \nbudgeting and programming of local expenditures; \n(ii)  improved  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in  planning,  public \nexpenditure management, and financial management as a result of rationalized \nand streamlined national government oversight functions and strengthened local \ncapacity;  \n(iii)  enhanced  delivery  of  critical  public  services  at  the  local  level  by  providing \nadditional financing options and linking them to performance outcomes as well as \nimproved national government-LGU arrangements for devolved functions; \n(iv)  greater  LGU  access  to  public  and  private  sources  of  capital  as  a  result  of \nimproved policy and institutional environment, thereby contributing to increasing \nLGU ability to finance the delivery of local public services; and \n(v)  increased  LGU  own-source  revenues  to  fund  social  and  development \nexpenditures, as a result of strengthened LGU capacity to generate revenues \nfrom  real  property  and  business  taxes,  thereby  reducing  LGU  reliance  on \nnational  government  transfers,  and  consequently  reducing  the  Government\u2019s \nfiscal burden. \n \n82.  Institutional. The LGFBR will contribute to significant institutional development. The \npassage of RA 9358; issuance of Joint Circular No. 2006-1; issuance of JMC No. 1; and \ndevelopment and distribution of new and/or updated local planning, budgeting, procurement, \ntreasurers\u2019 and assessors\u2019 guidelines/manuals are major steps towards improving predictability \nand transparency in the release of the IRA and LGUs\u2019 share in national wealth as well as the \npolicy  and  institutional  environment  for  planning,  public  expenditure  management,  financial \nmanagement, and local revenue generation. In this manner, enhancement of the governance \nstructure in the LFF\u2014through approval of the LGU financing framework and the eligibility of \nmunicipal bonds as reserve investments of insurance companies, and issuance of the Central \nBank of the Philippines (BSP) guidelines allowing private banks to act as trustee banks for LGU \nbond issues\u2014promotes institutionalization of market discipline in LGU operations. Altogether, \nthese enhancements in the policy and regulatory environment will promote greater efficiency in \nlocal administration functioning and also improve service delivery. \n \n83.  Social  and  Economic.  By  increasing  the  resource  inflows  of  LGUs  from  both \nintergovernmental  transfers  and  local  sources,  and  by  improving  LGU  performance \nmeasurement in the delivery of devolved services, the LGFBR Program enhances not only the \n ", "  29 \ncapacity of LGUs to fund social sector expenditures but also their effectiveness. It is expected \nthat, in the medium term, both the volume and quality of social spending will increase. By \nimproving LGU access to the private capital market and increasing the availability of financing \nfor  urban  infrastructure,  the  LGFBR  increases  the  ability  of  LGUs  to  fund  critical  local \ninfrastructure, which is key to promoting local economic development and growth. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n84.  While some of risks are irreducibly political, therefore outside the scope of the Program \nto affect directly, core elements of the Program and ADTA contribute to mitigating these risks \nthrough greater transparency and accountability mechanisms that strengthen the capacity of \nlocal  authorities  and  provide  active  monitoring  by  civil  society  groups.  Potential  risks  to \nsubprogram 1 and underlying assumptions are as follows: \n \n(i)  Political  delays. Delays may be experienced in engaging the LGUs for the \nsecond phase since the elections for their respective League officers are in the \nthird quarter of 2007. However, the Leagues have endorsed the phase one and \ntwo triggers and it is expected that no major changes in policy orientation will \noccur despite changes in the Executive Board of the Leagues.  \n(ii)  External  pressures.  Deterioration  in  the  external  environment  may  trigger \ninternal  financial  problems  and  may  encourage  the  Government  not  to  fully \nrelease the IRA amount to the LGUs. A portion of the IRA was withheld during \nthe 1997 financial crisis since it was determined to be an \u201cunmanageable public \nsector deficit\u201d. The Government has a strong commitment in achieving its fiscal \nconsolidation objectives to maintain macroeconomic stability. The development \npartners  have  contributed  substantial  resources  to  support  the  fiscal \nconsolidation agenda. In addition, legislative and legal measures are now in \nplace to prevent recurrence of the 1997 chain of events.  \n(iii)  Clientelism. There is a risk that when LGUs are provided additional resources, \nthe benefits of their investments go only to a select few. However, the LGFBR \nProgram contains two mitigating actions. One, direct government credit related \ncore  actions  support  investments  in  basic service  delivery  in  areas  such  as \nhealth and MDG projects that target the poor. Furthermore, credit programs for \npolicy reforms are directed at improving areas of governance that do not favor a \nparticular  group.  Two,  the  program-supported  core  actions  and  TA  aims  to \nimprove  local  performance  and  measure  improvement  in  the  general \ncommunity\u2019s welfare.  \n(iv)  Coordination and capacity constraints. Willingness for coordination among \noversight agencies for harmonization of local planning, investment programming, \nrevenue administration, budgeting, and expenditure management may weaken \nover time. However, the Government is committed to implementing the JMC. To \nresolve possible issues and to ensure continued progress, a technical committee \nis being organized to oversee JMC implementation. \n(v)  Resource constraints. The Government may run out of resources for capacity \ndevelopment activities planned under this Program. Although these are heavily \nfunded by current ADB projects, it is possible that some training programs may \nbe underfunded. However, many donors are also providing TA grants for local \nreforms and capacity development.  \n(vi)  Moral hazard. Increased private sector financing to LGUs may result in a moral \nhazard  problem.  Some  private  financial  institutions  may  not  perform  due \ndiligence when financing LGUs because of the attractiveness of IRA deposits. \n ", "30 \nFurthermore, allowing private banks unrestrained access to IRA deposits may \nnot result in additional financing for LGU projects and might merely increase the \nprofitability of private banks from the spreads they would earn on the use of \nthese funds. As mitigation, DOF will issue guidelines to regulate the access of \nprivate banks to LGU IRA deposits consistent with good financial governance. \n \n85.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness. The loan will become effective on meeting all \ntranche conditions, as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n86.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the structural adjustment costs and \nlocal currency costs relating to the implementation of the Program and other \nactivities consistent with the objectives of the Program, as more fully described in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2); \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the LGFBR Loan Agreement, \nas described in the development policy letter (including the policy matrix), will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the LGFBR and subsequently. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n87.  I am satisfied that the proposed cluster and loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the program cluster to the Republic of the Philippines for the Local Government \nFinancing and Budget Reform Program Cluster; and \n \n(ii)  the loan of \u00a534,253,100,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for Subprogram 1 \nof the Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program Cluster, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term \nof 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nProgram Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n13 November 2007 \n ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n\u2022  The efficiency and  \u2022  More than half of the  \u2022  Relevant indicators of  \u2022  LGU use enhanced \neffectiveness of  aggregate LGU level  LGPMS dataset  resources for investments \nbasic public services  indicators (below)  (comparison 2005 to 2008)  other than in basic public \ndelivered by LGUs to  improve by one-fifth to  services, i.e., government \ntheir constituent  one-tenth of 2005  administration buildings, \ncommunities has  results by 2010: (i) ratio  rent-seeking \nincreased  of health facilities to   \n  population, (ii) access   \nto basic services such \nas water and electricity, \n(iii) sanitation condition, \n(iv) extent of solid \nwaste collection and \ndisposal, (v) presence \nof sewerage facility \nOutcome      Assumption \n\u2022  LGU avail of  \u2022  Real local government  \u2022 BLGF SRE data  \u2022  Mechanisms are in place \nenhanced resources  revenues, including    in LGUs at all levels to \nand capacities to  access to public and    provide incentives to make \nplan and budget for  private sources of    use of enhanced \nthe general welfare  credit, increase by at    resources and capacities \nof their constituent  least 4% annually at all    to plan and budget for the \ncommunities in a  levels of government    general welfare of \ntransparent and  from 2007 in two thirds    constituent communities \naccountable way  of all provinces and    Risk \n  highly urbanized cities    \u2022  Delays may be  \nand in the majority of    experienced in engaging \nfourth to sixth income    LGUs since the election \nclass other LGUs    for their respective League \n\u2022  Real expenditures for  \u2022 BLGF SRE data  officers is in the third \nservice delivery    quarter of 2007 \nincrease by at least 2%   \nannually from 2008 in   \ntwo thirds of provinces   \nand highly urbanized   \ncities and in the   \nmajority of fourth to   \nsixth income class   \nother LGUs   \n\u2022  Number of fraudulent  \u2022 COA information \ncases reported by COA \ndecreases by at least \n20% at all levels of \ngovernment \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

The Decentralization Context  \n \n1.  Governance and Accountability \n \n1.  The economic rationale for decentralization is that it can improve governance by making \npublic service delivery more efficient. Local governments are in closer contact with citizens than \nthe national Government, so they are better placed to respond to citizens\u2019 preferences. This \nallows them to match services to local needs. The economic literature argues that political \naccountability can translate local information into better services. If people are dissatisfied with \ndecisions of local politicians, they can vote them out of power (voice), or they can move (exit) to \na region that better matches their preferences. Figure A5 illustrates the shortened accountability \nchain within a local government compared with centralized systems.  \n \n2.  Better services require accountability among the actors. There are two routes, short and \nlong, through which citizens can hold organizations accountable for service delivery. In the long \nroute of accountability, citizens can give mandates to politicians to design services to respond to \ntheir needs. If politicians cannot fulfill their mandates, citizens can vote them out of office. In \nturn,  politicians  exercise  control  over  civil  service  management  authorities  to  motivate \norganizations to provide proper services to the citizens. The short route connects citizens with \nthe organizations through a direct accountability relationship.1 \n \n  Figure A5: Accountability Chains in Decentralized Context \n \nSource:  Economics  and  Research  Department,  Asian  Development  Bank.  2007. \nCritical Issues of Fiscal Decentralization. Manila. \n \n3.  In  practice,  however,  decentralization  reforms  are  mostly  driven  by  political \nconsiderations\u2014with the economic rationale being secondary if not marginal to the decision. In \nthe case of the Philippines, the decision was sparked by strong reactions to a prolonged period \nof highly authoritarian rule. The 1987 Constitution includes provisions assuring local autonomy \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004. World Development Report 2004. Washington, DC. \n ", "  Appendix 5  53 \nto local governments. The Local Government Code (LGC), 1991, spells out the detailed aspects \nof local autonomy. The Code has the following governance features: \n \n(i)  Accountability.  Term  of  office  is  set  at  3  years  with  a  maximum  of  three \nconsecutive  terms;  local  fiscal  administrative  duties  and  responsibilities  are \nexplicitly laid out. \n(ii)  Transparency. Local officials are mandated to submit their statements of assets \nand  liabilities,  and  members  of  the  Sanggunian  (legislative  assembly)  are \nmandated to fully disclose their business interests; government procurement is \narranged through local prequalification, bids, and awards committees. \n(iii)  Participation. Local governments are mandated to create local special bodies: \nLocal School Board, Local Health Board, Local Development Council, and Local \nPeace and Order Council, with representation from nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and other civil society groups. The role ascribed to NGOs and people\u2019s \norganizations  under  the  Code  includes  cooperative  arrangements  with  local \ngovernment units (LGUs) in the delivery of basic services and capacity building. \n \n4.  Although decentralization can strengthen accountability to improve services, a number of \nkey  governance  risks  could  hamper  the  advantages  of  decentralization:  (i)  state  capture, \n(ii) clientelism, (iii) capacity constraints, (iv) power struggle between levels of government, and \n(v) weaknesses in interregional informational flows that are critical for effective competition. \nThese  risks  are  more  prevalent  at  the  local  level  than  at  the  national  level.  In  case \ndecentralization is poorly designed, these governance distortions could undermine any positive \ngains in accountability.2  \n \n5.  State capture3 thrives when the market for political influence is dominated by highly \nconcentrated interest groups, in particular powerful firms or families, in a context of weak \npolitical competition. It distorts the chain of accountability between politicians, organizations, \nand citizens. In the Philippines, as in most decentralized countries, powers in local government \ntend to be concentrated in the executive, with weak representation from institutions that are \nsupposed to check on the state capture, such as the police and judiciary. These institutions \noften lack technical and support staff, resources, experience, and training. Other countervailing \npowers, such as the media and NGOs, representing a broader range of public interests, are \ngenerally  less  developed  in  local  jurisdictions.  Decentralization  in  the  Philippines  did  not \ndramatically alter the local political landscape, as the political dominance of wealthy families and \nclans continued. However, a dynamic and vibrant civil society is emerging in many local areas. \n \n6.  Clientelism  is  the  practice  by  which  politicians  distribute  publicly  funded  goods  to \nselected members of the electorate in return for votes and political support as opposed to \nmaking such goods generally accessible to all members of their jurisdiction. In poor areas in the \nPhilippines,  patronage,  the  so-called  kasal-binyag-libing  (wedding-baptism-burial)  support, \nwhich a mayor is expected to provide to constituents, is the acceptable norm.  \n \n7.  Capacity  Constraints.  Decentralization  requires  local  governments  not  only  to \nimplement, but also to formulate policies. They are also required to interact effectively with a \ncomplex set of stakeholders. This requires a wide range of skills among local politicians and \ngovernment officials, which they are still developing. In addition, appropriate systems for public \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 2005. East Asia Decentralizes: Making Local Government Work.

In the Philippines, capacity problems are not \nlimited to the executive branch of the Government, but also include actors in the countervailing \ninstitutions, the legislature and judiciary, and civil society groups. \n \n8.  Intergovernmental Tension. Decentralization reconfigures the relationships between \npublic sector institutions, and between national level and local government. It often generates \nconflicting  incentives  at  different  levels  of  government  and  within  different  branches  of \ngovernment. The result is that the shape of decentralization is constantly evolving, reflecting \nchanging  political  and  economic  realities,  competing  interests,  and  shifting  priorities. \nDiscussions over the extent and contours of decentralization between levels of government tend \nto place constraints on the autonomy of local governments. Although the LGC provides for \nelaborate  service  delivery  responsibilities  for  local  governments,  Section  17  of  the  Code \nencourages a two-track delivery system where both national and local governments can initiate \ndevolved services\u2014confusing what was meant to be a clear-cut assignment on the expenditure \nside. The most significant source of revenue for smaller municipalities, besides the internal \nrevenue allotment (IRA), is \u201cpork barrel\u201d, the share of government spending allocated through \ncongressmen to their constituents on a discretionary basis. The resulting lack of transparency \nand predictability undermines planning for the use of these funds. In addition, local governments \noften face strong constraints on raising local revenues that limit the autonomy they may have \nbeen given over local services. Notable among these are: (i) limited powers in setting tax rates, \n(ii) weak administrative capacity, and (iii) poor taxpayer information database. All these factors \ngenerate substantial uncertainty as to the distribution of functions and responsibilities, the extent \nof autonomy, and the balance of power between levels of government. Such uncertainty can \nweaken accountability for any of the involved actors, and can stifle investment and interregional \ncompetition. \n \n9.  Stifling  Interregional  Competition.  One  of  the  main  justifications  in  favor  of \ndecentralization is that it can enhance competition among jurisdictions. With mobility of capital \namong regions, businesses can look for jurisdictions where regulations are not needlessly \ncomplex, where infrastructure is good, and where relationships of trust can be developed with \nlocal officials. This kind of competition can act as a disciplining device for local governments, \nstrengthening incentives for delivering transparent and accountable services. The risk, however, \nis that this kind of competition could become too intense, pushing governments to overshoot \nincentives or resulting in negative spillover effects, such as exporting taxes or pollution to \nneighboring regions. Rise in economic investment is not necessarily inconsistent with \u201cbad\u201d \ngovernance.  The  economic  resurgence  of  Cavite,  for  instance,  coincided  with  repressive \nmethods to ban workers\u2019 strikes in factories within the special economic zones, reportedly with \nthe local government\u2019s tacit approval.   \n \n2.  Service Delivery \n \n10.  In line with the transfer of functions to LGUs mandated under the Code, and more \nresources at their disposal, total LGU expenditure expanded relative to gross national product \n(GNP) and relative to total general government expenditure. Total LGU spending doubled from \nan average of 1.6% of GNP in 1985\u20131991 to 3.4% of GNP in 1992\u20132005. Similarly, the share of \nLGUs in total general government expenditure net of debt service rose from an average of \n11.0% in the pre-Code period to an average of 24.2% in the post-Code period (Table A5.1). \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  55 \nTable A5.1: LGU Expenditure Relative to GNP and to General Government Expenditure \n(%) \n  Ratio of LGU Expenditure to  Expenditure to General Government Debt \nYear  GNP (%)  Expenditure Net of Debt Service (%) \n1985  1.54   12.17 \n1987  1.44   10.67 \n1989  1.53   11.20 \n1991  1.89   12.74 \n1993  2.72   20.20 \n1995  3.53   22.38 \n1997  3.75   22.04 \n1999  3.67   23.55 \n2001  3.75   26.33 \n2003  3.55  26.87 \n2005  2.88  25.76 \nAverage      \n1985\u20131991  1.61   11.40 \n1992\u20132005  3.36  24.15 \nGNP = gross national product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource: Commission on Audit, Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n11.  The major increase in LGU spending on social services between 1991 and 2005 went to \nhealth and education. Aggregate LGU expenditure on health rose almost threefold from 0.1% of \nGNP in 1991 to 0.3% of GNP in 2005, while LGU spending on education doubled from 0.1% to \n0.2% of GNP. The increase in health spending was largely because LGUs absorbed the cost of \ndevolved health personnel, which constituted over half the total cost of all devolved personnel. \nThe increase in education spending largely reflects the higher priority that local officials assign \nto  this  sector,  as  LGUs  did  not  have  to  absorb  devolved  personnel.  In  contrast,  social \nexpenditures for housing and community development and social welfare have been declining \nor stagnant over the same period.  \n \n12.  In addition to the unclear expenditure assignments, the major bottlenecks that constrain \nimprovements in local service delivery and governance can broadly be attributed to lack of \nresources, weak fiscal and expenditure management, and lack of performance measurement. \nThe lack of resources is mainly due to insufficient access of LGUs to development credit from \npublic sources for social projects and private capital markets for income-generating projects, \nuncertainty in national transfers, and insufficient generation of local own-source revenues. Weak \nfiscal and expenditure management can be attributed to a lack of clear guidance and support \nfrom  national  government  oversight  agencies  and  weak  local  capacity.  The  ineffective \nperformance measurement system is due to insufficient resources to improve existing systems \nand  lack  of  incentives  for  LGUs  to  be  more  performance-oriented.  The  following  sections \nprovide an analysis of the above-mentioned key factors that need to be addressed to ensure \nmore effective implementation of the LGC. Some of the issues can be addressed within the \nexisting legal provisions, while others would require changes in the LGC which may become \npolitically feasible in the medium term. \n \nB.   Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations \n \n13.  National government transfers to LGUs are of three types: (i) formula-based block grants \n(i.e., IRA); (ii) origin-based share in central government revenues (i.e., share in national wealth \nand other taxes); and (iii) ad hoc categorical grants.   \n \n \n ", "56  Appendix 5 \n1.  Internal Revenue Allotment  \n14.  Under the LGC, the aggregate IRA of LGUs is set at 40% of the actual internal revenue \ntax collections of the central Government 3 years prior to the current year. The aggregate IRA is \nthen divided among the different levels of local government as follows: 23% to provinces, \n23% to cities, 34% to municipalities, and 20% to barangays (villages). The IRA share of each \ntier of local government is then apportioned to individual LGUs on the basis of population (50%), \nland area (25%), and equal sharing (25%). The IRA is transferred as a block grant, so LGUs \nenjoy considerable discretion in its utilization. The IRA surged from 3.3% of national government \nexpenditures  (0.6%  of  GNP  in  1985\u20131991)  to  12.3%  of  national  government  expenditures \n(2.2% of GNP) in 1992\u20132005, causing increased pressure on national government expenditures \nin recent years.   \n \n15.  On average, the contribution of the IRA to total LGU income net of borrowings expanded \nfrom 36.7% in 1985\u20131991 to 64.6% in 1992\u20132005 for all LGUs combined (Table A5.2). This \ntrend is more prominent in provinces and municipalities than in cities. The share of IRA in total \nincome net of borrowings of cities increased from 33.2% in the pre-LGC period to 46.2% in the \npost-LGC period. The corresponding figures for municipalities rose from 38.3% to 73.8% while \nthose for provinces increased from 38.8% to 81.0%. There is some evidence that the IRA \ntended to substitute for local tax revenues of provinces and cities in the post-Code period \n(1992\u20132000). The analysis suggests that LGUs which received higher IRA (whether in absolute \nterms or relative to their expenditure responsibilities) tended to be lax in their tax effort.  \n \nTable A5.2: IRA and Other Grants as a Portion of Total LGU Income  \nand LGU Expenditure (%) \nNational Government Transfers as % of  National Government Transfers as % of \n   LGU Total Income  LGU Expenditure \nYear  Total  IRA  Other Grants  Total  IRA  Other Grants \nAverage              \n1985\u20131991  51.4  36.7  14.7  53.2  38.0  15.2 \n1992\u20132005  66.0  64.6  0.6  67.2  65.7  0.6 \nIRA = internal revenue allotment, LGU = local government unit. \nSource: Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n16.  National transfers have been criticized for: (i) the lack of reliability in transfer releases \nand  appropriations  that  undermine  the  ability  of  LGUs  to  plan  and  manage  expenditures \neffectively; (ii) inequalities and distortions in distribution built into the current allocation system \n(i.e., allocation among the various levels of LGUs and between different LGUs at the same level \nof government, which result in some LGUs such as cities being better off in terms of net \ntransfers less cost of devolved functions); and (iii) negative incentives created for local revenue \ngeneration since the LGU is always assured of income from the IRA, and increases in the \nLGU\u2019s IRA are subject to improvements in national tax collections instead of good governance \non the part of LGUs. \n \n17.  Notwithstanding the formula-based determination of the aggregate IRA share of LGUs \nand its distribution to individual LGUs, as well as the LGC provision for automatic release of the \nIRA, the IRA evolved to be a highly unpredictable revenue source for LGUs between 1998 and \n2004 as the central Government, faced with severe fiscal constraints, persistently reduced the \namount of intergovernmental transfers to LGUs. In those years, the mandated IRA share was \neither not appropriated in full, the amount appropriated for IRA was not released in full, the IRA \nappropriation was not released on time, or the IRA share was effectively cut because the budget \n ", "  Appendix 5  57 \nwas  reenacted.  A  2004  ruling  of  the  Supreme  Court  on  the  IRA  marked  a  dramatic  and \nsignificant shift in the treatment of the IRA. Republic Act 9358, July 2006, stated in very clear \nterms that future LGU share in national internal revenue taxes or the IRA shall henceforth be \nautomatically appropriated. This meant that the IRA is now not only automatically released but \nalso automatically appropriated (Table A5.3) \n \nTable A5.3: Comparison of IRA Appropriations and IRA Obligations \n(P billion) \n Item  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004 \n (1) Mandated IRA share: 40% of net BIR  \n       revenues 3 years back a  81.0  96.8  121.8    131.9  134.4  141.0  143.4 \n (2) Appropriations  81.0  96.8  111.8  b  111.8  134.4  141.0  141.0 \n (3) Obligations  76.9  95.3  114.3  c  115.8  134.4  141.0  141.0 \n (1) less (3)  4.1  1.5  7.5    16.1  0.0  0.0  2.4 \nBIR = Bureau of Internal Revenue, IRA = internal revenue allotment. \na  As indicated by IRA level proposed in President\u2019s budget. \nb P10 billion of the P121.8 billion mandated share was put under \u201cunprogrammed funds\u201d in the General \nAppropriations Act. \nc in  the  course  of  the  budget  year,  P2.5  billion  was  transferred  from  the  \u201cunprogrammed  funds\u201d  to  the \n\u201cprogrammed\u201d portion of budget. \nSource: Department of Budget and Management. \n \n18.  Finance did not follow function overall4. Variations in net resource transfer5 across levels \nof local government are substantial. In the aggregate, the net resource transfer for cities is \nconsistently larger than those for provinces and municipalities. While the net resource transfer \nhas consistently been positive for cities in 1995\u20132003, it was estimated to be negative for \nprovinces  and  municipalities  in  1995\u20131999.  This  analysis  suggests  that  provinces  and \nmunicipalities in the aggregate are relative net losers while cities were relative net winners from \nfiscal decentralization. In relation to the IRA, the Congressional Development Fund and Priority \nDevelopment Assistance Fund (PDAF) are allocated to members of congress for discretionary \nspending at LGU level. These funds have been channeled to local investments in a non-\ntransparent way, undermining LGU planning for strategic use of such funds. It is estimated that \nthe non-IRA funding to LGUs is P25.4 billion, with congressional allocations amounting to over \n60% of this amount.6 To improve transparency in the allocation and use of such funds, the \nDepartment of Budget and Management (DBM) is posting the PDAF figures on its website.  \n \n2.  Share in National Wealth  \n19.  In addition to the IRA, LGUs are entitled to a 40% share in the forestry charges and \nmining taxes and royalties collected by the central Government from entities operating in their \nterritorial jurisdiction. They also have a 40% share in the proceeds that the central Government \nreceives in any joint venture, coproduction, or production agreements in the utilization and \ndevelopment of national wealth in their jurisdiction. The timely and complete release of the \nLGUs\u2019  share  in  national  wealth  taxes  in  the  past  has  been  hampered  by  (i)  problems  in \naccurately estimating the tax collections from natural resource taxes since actual tax collections \nfor the immediately preceding year are not yet known when the General Appropriations Act \n                                                 \n4  A basic principle of fiscal decentralization is that devolved functions need to be adequately financed.  \n5  The net resource transfer for a given year is computed as the difference between the IRA for the said year, and the \nsum of the adjusted cost of devolved functions, cost of other mandates including the provision for the 20% \nDevelopment Fund and sectoral representation and 1992 IRA.; adjustments on the cost side were made to take \ninto account population growth and inflation. \n6  Pellegrini, Soriano. 2003. A Study to Revisit the LGU Financing Framework and its Implementation. Washington, \nDC: World Bank.  \n ", "58  Appendix 5 \n(GAA) is prepared; and (ii) lack of information on situs7 of tax. In particular, the collection \nagencies (BIR for mining taxes, Department of Environment and Natural Resources for forestry \ncharges, Department of Energy for energy taxes, and Mines and Geosciences Bureau for \nmining royalties) are required to submit a certification showing the corresponding share of each \nprovince, city, municipality, and barangay; a certificate of actual remittance of tax collections for \nthe preceding year from the Bureau of Treasury; and a request for the release of the shares to \nDBM.   \n \n  3.  Specific Grants and Subsidized Credit Programs \n \n20.  Many sector agencies provide specific grants to LGUs funded out of their own budgets. \nThese programs are aimed at encouraging LGUs to fund and undertake activities that are \nsupportive  of  national  programs  and  objectives.  The  matching  grants  program  of  the \nDepartment  of  Health  for  the  promotion  of  family  planning  is  an  example.  The  official \ndevelopment assistance funds intended for LGUs are first appropriated and allocated to the \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) that serves as a conduit. The MDFO then releases \nthe  funds  in  the  form  of  either  loans  and/or  grants  to  LGUs.  The  MDFO  prescribes  a \nloan/equity/grant mix in the financing of varying types of LGU projects, depending on the income \ntype of the LGU concerned. For instance, other things being equal, the grant share of lower-\nincome LGUs is larger than that of higher-income LGUs (correspondingly, the equity share and \nloan share of less well-off LGUs is smaller than those of better-off LGUs). On the other hand, \nthe  grant  share  is  highest  for  social  projects  and  blue/green  (marine  and  forest  related) \nenvironmental projects, followed by brown (waste management) environmental projects and \nrevenue-generating projects.  \n \nC.   Financial Management, Planning, and Public Expenditure Management \n \n1.   Local Development Planning and Public Expenditure Management \n \n21.  There is a need to strengthen capacities for local development planning and strengthen \nthe linkage between development planning and budget management in order for LGUs to meet \ntheir mandate for local economic development more effectively and efficiently. Local planning \ncapacities tend to be weak. According to a recent study, less than 70% of provinces surveyed \nhad up-to-date local development plans (LDPs) and local development investment programs \n(LDIPs). LGUs are also under pressure to prepare a multitude of sector specific planning \ndocuments and are besieged by numerous planning guidelines, some of which are outdated. \nThe only plan available in many of the smaller municipalities is the annual investment plan \n(AIP). In many LGUs, the AIPs are prepared to comply with the budgetary requirement that no \nappropriation chargeable to the Local Development Fund can be made if the project is not listed \nin the LGU\u2019s AIP. The AIPs in many LGUs do not appear to be anchored on clear goals, \nstrategies, and programs. They typically do not set program targets and, seldom if ever, is there \nan explicit assessment of benefits. At best, some cursory reference is made to \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d or \n\u201cclients served\u201d. In many LGUs, investment programming is also not based on a systematic \nevaluation of projects\u2019 costs and benefits. Instead, prioritization appears to be done largely on \nan ad hoc basis, and the process is driven by local chief executives.   \n \n22.  Only 30\u201350% of LGUs have Local Development Councils (LDCs) in place. Moreover, \none survey found that less than a third of LGUs have development plans that benefited from \n                                                 \n7 Situs refers to the site or location of the taxable entity.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  59 \nmeaningful NGO/people\u2019s organization participation.8 Given this situation, it is not surprising that \nLGU officials do not have a good understanding of their constituents\u2019 expenditure preferences. \nIn a survey, it was found that municipal officials correctly anticipate households\u2019 first priority in \n5 out of 10 cases while provincial officials cite the top preference of households in only 3 cases. \nThis finding raises questions on the extent of the improvement in allocation efficiency that is \nexpected to result from fiscal decentralization. \n \n23.  Poor coordination between national Government and LGU planning has resulted in a \nbreak in the planning chain\u2014occurring between the regional and provincial levels. The regional \ndevelopment plan, formulated by the Regional Development Council, is seldom if ever taken \ninto consideration by LGUs.9 Thus, the LDPs of many LGUs are formulated quite independently \nof regional and national development plans. Conversely, regional development plans tend to \nignore LDPs ostensibly because they are meant to focus solely on interprovincial projects. Many \nLGU officials complain that national government agencies do not consult adequately with LGUs \nin the planning and implementation of programs and projects located within their jurisdictions. \nMany of these projects are reported to be inconsistent with the perceived needs of the LGUs \nthemselves  (i.e., local  demand)  since  national  line  agencies  are  not  obliged  to  follow  the \nRegional  Development  Investment  Plan-based  regional  budget.  Consequently,  the  regional \ndevelopment plans are usually more reflective of the national government line agencies that \nhave the budget to fund the projects contained therein. Even for LGUs that have current LDPs, \nthe programs and projects in the AIP bear little resemblance to those in the LDP and LDIP. \nCloser scrutiny of the LDPs, LDIPs, and AIPs in five sample provinces shows that there is an \nimperfect match between the projects listed in the LDPs/LDIPs and those listed in the AIPs. \nConsequently, there is often very little correlation between the LGU\u2019s LDP and its budget of \nexpenditures. \n \n24.  The  local  budget  process  tends  to  be  inefficient  and  non-transparent. 10 First, \nincome/revenue estimates, on which the annual budget is based, tend to be poor. Many local \ntreasurers do not appear to follow a systematic approach in calculating their income estimates. \nAggregate LGU data for 1997\u20132001 show that, in general, the revenue estimates for own-\nsource revenue are seldom met, with 5\u201315% shortfall in own-source revenues. Poor revenue \nestimates lead to the sequestration of allotments (especially in the early part of the year), delays \nin  obligations,  and  subsequently,  project  implementation.  Thus,  for  the  most  part,  the \nappropriation does not necessarily reflect actual fund utilization. In addition, budgeting at the \nlocal level is done largely in an incremental fashion for existing programs. It not clear, however, \nthat the allocable balance is allocated in a strategic manner in line with their local development \nplans.  There  appears  to  be  no  consideration  given  in  a  systematic  fashion  to  program \nperformance and expected outcomes in allocating the budget across sectors and programs. \n \n25.  Gender and Development. The GAA has a gender and development policy requiring \nthat at least 5% of the total budget be allocated to gender concerns. At the local level, this policy \nis implemented under the Joint Memorandum of Agreement 2001-01 between the National \nCommission on the Role of Filipino Women, Department of Interior and Local Government \n(DILG), and DBM, which postulates \u201call province, cities, municipalities, and barangays shall \nprepare a gender and development plan addressing the gender issues of the locality\u201d in line with \nthe provisions of the LGC\u201d. The Local Government Code (Sections 446, 457, and 467) address \n                                                 \n8  United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Procurement \n \n26.  As part of expenditure management reforms, the Government Procurement Reform Act \n(GPRA)  was  passed  in  2003  to  address  the  reported  persistent  corruption  in  government \nprocurement  at  all  levels  and  to:  (i)  address  the  proliferation  of  laws  on  public  sector \nprocurement, which facilitated rent-seeking and inefficiencies; (ii) reorganize and strengthen \nagency  and  local  government  bids  and  award  committees  and  procurement  units;  and \n(iii) strengthen the system of reward and punishment in the performance of the procurement \nfunction. The implementation of the GPRA has now been intensified at the LGU level. The \nGovernment Procurement Policy Board of DBM has reported that, as of June 2007, 86% of all \nLGUs have implemented the law.  \n \n  3.  Financial Reporting and Audit \n \n27.  The  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  is  an  independent  constitutional  body  and  the \nPhilippines\u2019 supreme audit institution. It has introduced and rolled out a New Government \nAccounting System (NGAS) for all levels of government, aiming to (i) simplify government \naccounting, (ii) conform to international accounting standards, and (iii) generate periodic and \nrelevant financial statements for better performance monitoring. It has several features that \nmake it a significantly better system\u2014including a modified accrual accounting basis, improved \naccounting for assets, the adoption of a single fund concept, and a simplified three-digit chart of \naccounts. In accordance with the NGAS, the audited statements of LGUs need to be made \npublicly available and accessible. The Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) is currently \nharmonizing its LGU financial reporting system for local treasurers, the statement of receipts \nand expenditures (SRE), with the NGAS to achieve this. \n \nD.  Performance Measurement \n \n28.  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest on the part of LGUs, \nnational government agencies, and international organizations in the assessment of LGU fiscal, \nfinancial, and service delivery performance. In the past, many tools were developed to evaluate \nthe performance of local governments, but most did not prove very effective or addressed only \nnarrow concerns. The Local Government Performance Measurement System (LGPMS) of DILG \nis a major initiative. It provides LGUs with one tool to assess their strengths and weaknesses in \nthe performance of their new roles and responsibilities brought about by devolution, and uses \nindicators  mostly  derived  from  the  LGC.  BLGF  is  also  compiling  an  online  database  of \n126 financial characteristics of LGUs. This database is integrated in a parallel performance \nmonitoring  system  called  the  Local  Government  Financial  Performance  Monitoring  System \n(LGFPMS). Currently, the BLGF database or LGFPMS is being linked to the LGPMS to allow \nthe integration of financial data with development and service delivery data, and strengthen the \nlinkage between measuring outputs and allocating inputs.  \n \nE.  LGU Credit Financing \n \n29.  Credit  financing  is  used  by  LGUs  to  support  development  of  infrastructure,  capital \ninvestment, and a portion of operating expenses. Sources include domestic banks, government \nfinancial  institution  (GFIs),  and  loans  through  the  Government  from  foreign  sources.  LGU \nborrowings rose steadily from P448 million in 1991 to a peak of P6.9 billion in 2004 and an \n ", "  Appendix 5  61 \naverage of P5.8 billion in 2001\u20132005. Thus, LGU borrowing became a more important source of \nLGU financing, accounting for 3.5% of total LGU receipts net of borrowing in 2005 from less \nthan  2%  in  1991  (Table  A5.4).  Cities  had  greater  access  to  the  LGU  credit  market  than \nprovinces  and  municipalities.  Borrowings  contributed  to  5.4%  of  the  total  receipts  net  of \nborrowings of cities compared to 3.7% in the case of provinces and 2.1% in the case of \nmunicipalities in the post-Code period. \n \nTable A5.4: LGU Borrowings, 1985\u20132005 \n(P million) \n  Average                            \nItem  1985\u20131991  1992\u20132005     1991  1995  1999  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nAll LGUs  110  4,111    448  2,493  5,949  5,574  4,219   5,635   6,879  6,651 \nProvinces  57  961    325  593  771  1,639  1,482   1,794   1,735  1,360 \nMunicipalities  12  840    37  579  561  892  915   1,853   1,103  1,610 \nCities  41  2,310    87  1,321  4,618  3,043  1,822   1,988   4,041  3,680 \nRatio to LGU  Average                            \n Income (%)  1985\u20131991  1992\u20132005     1991  1995  1999  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nAll LGUs  0.79  3.76    1.91  3.81  5.20  4.21  2.65  3.26  3.95  3.46 \nProvinces  1.50  3.69    5.51  3.59  2.78  5.21  3.87  4.48  4.36  3.09 \nMunicipalities  0.23  2.08    0.37  2.30  1.32  1.87  1.58  2.95  1.78  2.33 \nCities  0.88  5.37    1.13  5.59  10.48  5.70  2.88  2.83  5.60  4.65 \nLGU = local government unit. \nSource:  Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n30.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  is  for  the  capital  market,  rather  than  national \nagencies, to play a dominant role in financing LGUs. However, several key issues need to be \naddressed to facilitate LGU access to private capital markets. There is a need for transparent \nLGU financial information, credible LGU loan repayment capacity, availability of a collateral and \nother loan security, and a framework for LGUs to make deposits and set up special accounts for \nbond repayments. Addressing these issues may mitigate creditors\u2019 more general fears over the \nshort terms of local chief executives, lack of LGU familiarity with financing instruments, their \nweak project identification and preparation capacities, low credit worthiness, and the danger of \ndefault. \n \n31.  Not many LGUs are able to borrow from banks because not all are creditworthy. Overall, \ncities are better positioned to access credit financing. Thus, cities account for the bulk (54%) of \ntotal outstanding LGU loans (as of 30 June 2004) while provinces account for 18.8% and \nmunicipalities  25.8%.  Part  of  the  problem  is  the  lack  of  reliable  information  on  LGU \ncreditworthiness. On the other hand, cities are likely to have better financial information than \nprovinces  and  municipalities.  However,  important  constraints  continue  to  hamper  the \ndevelopment of the LGU bond market: higher costs associated with bond flotation compared \nwith  direct  bank  borrowing,  lack  of  reliable  information  about  LGUs,  uncertainty  about \nmanagement capacity at the LGU level, lack of a market for secondary trading, and lack of \naccess to IRA as security for LGU obligations.   \n \n32.  Some recent developments augur well for increasing LGU access to the capital market. \nIn October 2006, the Insurance Commission approved the request of the Financial Executives \nInstitute of the Philippines for the approval of municipal bonds as an eligible reserve investment \nof insurance companies. In February 2007, the Department of Finance issued a memorandum \norder officially adopting the LGU Financing Framework and the Government\u2019s cost-sharing \narrangement. The memorandum explicitly states that the provision of credit to LGUs by the \nGovernment will be governed \u201cthrough a policy of market segmentation, hand-in-hand with the \n ", "62  Appendix 5 \npolicy to graduate creditworthy LGUs to private sources of capital\u201d. The issuance further states \nthat \u201cLGUs with higher creditworthiness ratings will avail of private commercial financing, except \nfor  environmental  and  social  projects,  LGUs  that  have medium  creditworthiness  rating  will \naccess financing from GFIs, and those LGUs in the lower income tiers will avail of financing \nfrom the Government through the Municipal Development Fund\u201d. The issuance also provides a \nmaximum grant of 50% for LGUs in matters of LGU-national Government cost sharing. MDFO is \nalso  looking  into  performance-based  grants  and  is  commissioning  a  study  to  develop  a \nframework for policy-based grants which can be implemented next year.  \n \nE.  Local Own-Source Revenues \n33.  In 2006, tax revenue only accounted for 25% of total regular income.11 Studies have \nshown that LGUs have created revenue codes with a huge array of taxes, fees, and charges.12 \nMany of these are under-collected and some not collected. In addition, there are many low \nyielding  taxes  that  impose  substantial  collection  and  administrative  costs  on  LGUs  and \ncontribute to a lack of transparency on the side of the taxpayer. For example, taxes on peddlers, \nfishing vessels, and radio fees, each bring in no more than 0.02% of the LGUs total own-source \nrevenue on average. In Bacolod City, there are over 200 different rates for the mayor\u2019s business \npermit fee, all of which depend on the type of establishment. There is a need to focus on taxes, \nfees, and charges that have high yield potentials; and to improve their administration and \ncollection. \n \n34.  The LGC seriously limits the power of LGUs to set local tax rates. First, the Code fixes \nthe tax rate of some of the taxes that are assigned to LGUs (like the Special Education Fund, \nreal property tax and the community tax). Second, while LGUs have some discretion in setting \ntax rates in the case of other local taxes, the Code sets ceilings (or floors) on the tax rates that \nLGUs may impose, which in some cases appears to be low (or high) given current realities. For \ninstance, the LGC set ceilings for the real property tax assessment levels for different classes of \nproperty  whereas  the  assessment  levels  themselves  were  fixed  in  the  pre-LGC  period. \nMoreover,  the  maximum  assessment  levels  set  under  the  LGC  are  no  higher  and  often \nsignificantly  lower  than  the  fixed  assessment  rates  in  the  pre-LGC  period,13 resulting  in a \nreduction in the effective assessment levels of residential land, all types of buildings, and all \ntypes of machinery\u2014potentially leading to an erosion of real property tax (RPT) revenues. Third, \nthe Code mandates that tax rates can only be adjusted once in 5 years and by no more than \n10%. This provision is particularly restrictive in the case of taxes (e.g., the professional tax and \nthe tax on delivery vans and trucks) whose rates are specified in nominal peso terms. Clearly, \nthe resulting adjustments will not allow LGUs to maintain the real value of their revenues. That \nlocal tax administration is severely inadequate in many LGUs is highlighted by the declining \ntrend in the RPT collection efficiency of both provinces and cities in the post-Code period (Table \nA5.5).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  Bureau of Local Government Finance.  \n12 This can be partly attributed to the Code itself. Section 143 \u2013 Tax on Business has a very detailed schedule of fees \nthat can be simplified.  \n13 The LGC also provided for the exemption of residential buildings with market value below P175,000 from real \nproperty taxation.   \n ", "  Appendix 5  63 \nTable A5.5: Collection Rate of Current Year for Basic RPT, 1989\u20132000 (%) \n Year  All LGUs  Provinces  Cities \n1989  58.0  55.6  61.0 \n1991  58.9  54.1  65.1 \n1994  60.7  54.0  66.3 \n1997  57.4  50.0  62.0 \n1999  54.1  52.4  54.9 \n2000  54.6  44.7  57.1 \nAverage        \n1989\u20131991  58.2  54.4  63.1 \n1992\u20132000  55.4  49.0  59.7 \n       LGU = local government unit, RPT = real property tax. \n      Source: Commission on Audit, Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n35.  LGU  tax  administration  capacity  is  constrained  because  of  low  staff  professional \nqualifications and inadequate automation of core tasks. These problems affect all aspects of tax \nadministration\u2014poor taxpayer registration systems and low-quality record keeping results in \nwidespread tax delinquencies; tax audits and enforcement are inadequate, which erode the \ncredibility of the system and results in low compliance; and limited availability of taxpayer \nservices increases taxpayer compliance costs. The collection of local taxes is further weakened \nby either the lack of or the inadequacies of certain implementing guidelines governing local \ntaxation. For instance, the Local Treasurers\u2019 Manual has not been updated since 1954. BLGF is \ncurrently in the process of addressing this constraint. The revised local treasurers\u2019 manual is \ncurrently being prepared. \n \n36.  In an effort to improve real property tax collection, BLGF has improved the valuation \nstandards in the updated local assessors\u2019 manual, which was completed in 2006. The manual \nincludes revised valuation standards for a code of ethics, mass appraisal, and market values as \na basis of valuation. In 2008, it will be further updated to incorporate an addendum for valuation \nstandards for equipment and machinery. BLGF also provides an RPT enhancement program \n(as well as a local business enhancement program) that supports LGU efforts to improve their \ncollections through tax mapping, valuation techniques, and assessment support. MDFO is also \nproviding  substantial  capacity  development  support  and  training  in  standardized  project \nfinancing and other areas of resource mobilization. From 2008 onwards, MDFO is targeting to \ntrain an additional 228 LGUs in the aforementioned areas. To encourage LGUs to improve RPT \ncollection, MDFO through BLGF has provided a credit window for such improvements under its \nLocal Government Finance and Development (LOGOFIND) project.  \n \n ", "64  Appendix 6 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines:  \nDecentralization brings government closer to the people, making it more responsive and more likely to develop \npolicies and programs that meet local needs. It is thus argued that, in an economy with significant local variations in \npreferences, and when there are no significant economies of scale and scope, decentralized provision of public \nservices can enhance efficiency in the provision of these services and result in welfare gains.a Intergovernmental \ncompetition can also result in innovations in the provision of public services. Decentralization makes it is easier to \nidentify  the  beneficiaries  of  public  services  and  to  impose  user  charges  on  them  when  appropriate.  Thus, \ndecentralized provision of such services can help to link revenue-expenditure decisions at the margin. This can \nimprove both efficiency and accountability in the provision of public services, improving overall social welfare. \nHowever, to provide better services in response to local needs, local government units (LGUs) need the requisite \ntechnical capacity and appropriate institutional arrangements.  \n \nIn almost all countries, the poor are mostly concentrated in poorer localities and regions. In places where poverty is \nconcentrated, the levels of social services and physical infrastructure provided are low, resulting in low productivity of \nboth capital and labor. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that certain key services falling into the class of merit \ngoods are provided in these regions at a minimum level of standard without adversely affecting the incentive structure \nof local governments.  \n \nAlthough redistribution is traditionally considered a central government responsibility, it is erroneous to conclude that \nlocal governments do not have any role in implementing direct poverty alleviation policies. Proximity to the people \nreduces information and transaction costs in significantly designing and implementing anti-poverty strategy. Local \ngovernments have a distinct advantage in identifying the poor because of their proximity to the people. However, \nexperience in other countries shows that local participation in financing a part of the schemes, and in implementing the \nprograms, also improves accountability to local citizens on the one hand and to higher-level governments on the other. \n \nThe passage of the Local Government Code (LGC) in 1991 represented a major step in decentralization in the \nPhilippines. The LGC paved the way for increased local autonomy, expenditure responsibility, and revenue authority. \nIn particular, the main responsibility for the delivery of basic public services in health, education, and infrastructure \nwas devolved to the LGUs. In addition, the LGUs were given taxing authority to be able to generate resources to \ncomplement the internal revenue allotment (IRA), which they receive from the national Government. \n \nBest practices have emerged in many LGUs on resource mobilization, revenue generation, and service delivery, as \nwell as in improved overall management and reinvention of LGUs, improved local human resource management, \nincreased cooperation among LGUs, and improved social services. These best practice examples highlight the \npotential of local autonomy and devolution in contributing to the improvement of service delivery and overall welfare at \nthe local level. However, preliminary evidence also suggests that, despite these achievements, the expected benefits \nof decentralization have yet to be realized fully. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) contains ambitious poverty reduction targets. It proposes to \nreduce the poverty incidence of families from 28.4% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2010. Similarly, the subsistence incidence of \nfamilies is programmed to fall from 13.10% in 2000 to 8.98% in 2010. This would effectively allow the Philippines to \nmeet the United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty incidence in 2010 rather than 2015. \nIn reality, poverty incidence (defined as the proportion of families deemed poor) declined from 39.9% in 1991 to 27.5% \nin 2000 and 24.7% in 2003. Subsistence poverty incidence fell from 20.4% in 1991 to 10.4% in 2003. The Philippine \nperformance to date in reducing poverty suggests that the country is likely to achieve the MDG on poverty reduction \nalthough it might have some difficulty in meeting the MTPDP 2010 target.   \n \nAt the same time, geographical inequalities across the country\u2019s three island groups present a daunting challenge to \ndevelopment efforts. Social indicators reveal large regional disparities, with poverty incidence lowest in Metro Manila \n ", "  Appendix 6  65 \n(National Capital Region) and highest in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Provision of infrastructure \n(e.g., transport and communications) is uneven, isolating many communities from goods and basic services within the \ncountry, and lowering regional ability to connect to the global economy. Mindanao lags significantly in terms of \neconomic and social development indicators. It is home to nearly 24% of the country\u2019s population and accounts for \nabout 40% of people living in poverty. Conflict-affected areas, ravaged by years of unrest and intermittent warfare, are \nhome to the poorest of the poor. The poorest provinces and areas in Luzon and Visayas (particularly Bicol, Region V) \nalso need special attention in addressing interregional and intraregional disparities. A poverty mapping exercise \nidentified the poorest 40 provinces.b \n \nAccess to opportunities is far from equal in the Philippines as shown in Table A6 below. The poor belonging to the \nbottom of the income distribution have less job opportunities than the non-poor. Health services are largely utilized by \nthe top end of the income distribution. The majority of people prefer private clinics or rural health unit health centers. \nHowever, access to private clinics is mainly for the top end of the income distribution and access to the rural health \nunit and barangay (village) health stations are utilized more by people at the lower end of the income distribution. \nChildren at the bottom end of the income distribution have lower access to primary and secondary education. Basic \ninfrastructure services are not equally shared across the population, particularly for electricity and clean drinking \nwater.c  \nTable A6: Poverty Impact Analysis Matrix \nEffects on the Poor  Effects on Other  Mitigation or \nPossible Channels of Effect  Direct  Indirect  Indirect  Stakeholders  Enhancement \nShort Run  Short Run  Medium Run Measures \nAccess to Labor Markets, Wages           \nAccess to Markets and Prices           \nAccess to Assets           \nService Access    X  X  X  X \nDirect Transfers      X  X   \nNet impact: Slightly positive \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nWhile it has been suggested that growth processes in recent years have allowed lagging regions to catch up with \nleading regionsd (i.e., there is a tendency for household incomes at the provincial level to converge over the long \nterm), the response of poverty reduction to provincial income growth is quite modest by international standards. \nEvidence shows that improvements in access to roads, health, schooling, and electricity have positive effects not only \non income growth rates but also on poverty reduction. The sustained empowerment of LGUs remains critical.  \n \nThe  Local  Government  Financing  and  Budget  Reform  (LGFBR)  will  address  poverty  reduction  indirectly  by \ncontributing to increased efficiency and effectiveness of basic public services delivered by LGUs to their constituents \nthrough improved LGU access to development credit, thereby promoting activities towards achieving the MDGs. The \nLGFBR will further contribute indirectly to more efficient and effective public service delivery by addressing constraints \nin the predictable release of revenues and by improving access to private sources of capital, as well as through \nsupport to improved governance, by establishing more transparent and accountable LGU financial and administrative \nsystems. The LGFBR will contribute to enhancing LGU ability to generate own revenues from local business taxes and \nreal property taxes. \n  \nC.

Purpose and Background \n \n1.  The purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to support the Government in building \ninstitutional capacity in development and implementation of a medium-term reform agenda in \nlocal  government  financing  and  governance,  and  to  facilitate  the  achievement  of  delivery \ntargets/commitments in the Local Government Financing and Budget Reform (LGFBR) policy \nmatrix. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also actively supporting, through many ongoing \nTA projects, the implementation of related local government reforms. These include establishing \nframeworks for provincial and other local government unit (LGU) planning processes, improving \nquality and availability of financial data on LGUs, improving creditworthiness of LGUs, exploring \nimpediments  in  resource  mobilization,  improving  public  service  delivery,  and  developing \ncapacity in key oversight agencies. The TA will fill in any gaps in the ongoing assistance and \nspecifically target the medium-term reform areas.  \n \nB.   Impact and Outcome \n \n2.  The TA strives to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of basic public services \ndelivered by LGUs to their constituent communities. The expected outcome is the enhanced \ncapacities  of  the  LGUs  to  plan  and  budget  for  the  general  welfare  of  their  constituent \ncommunities in a transparent and accountable way.  \n \nC.   Outputs \n \n3.  Coordination  Committee  on  Decentralization  (CCD).  This  will  strengthen  the \ncoordination  mechanism  by  establishing  a  CCD  to  promote,  coordinate,  and  oversee \ndecentralization reforms, including the changes envisaged in the LGFBR policy matrix through \nthe following activities: \n \n(i)  Support the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) in the review of \nprevious experiences with decentralization coordination bodies in the Philippines \nand other countries (e.g., Thailand) as well as in the analysis of relevant political \neconomy issues in the Philippines. \n(ii)  Support DILG in discussions with other oversight agencies (National Economic \nand Development Authority [NEDA], Department of Finance [DOF], Department of \nBudget and Management [DBM]); the LGU Leagues; and other potential members \nto agree on the specific mandate, participants, and working arrangements of the \ncommittee. Relevant topics include issues covered in the LGFBR program matrix \nsuch  as  the  rollout  of  the  joint  memorandum  circular  no.  1  (JMC),  and \nimplementation of decentralization at the local level. Other areas that can be \naddressed include horizontal and vertical equity issues of transfers, and other \nconcerns raised by the LGU leagues. \n(iii)  Facilitate  the  work  of  the  Committee  in  matters  such  as  agenda  setting, \nfacilitation, documentation of meetings, dissemination of minutes, and drafting of \nrecommendations on the direction of necessary changes in legislation based on \nguidance provided by the Committee and relevant implementation agencies.  \n(iv)  Support evaluation of the work of the Committee at regular intervals. \n \n4.  Planning Guidelines and Capacity Needs Assessment. This will strengthen planning \nand  budget  management  capacities  at  the  city  level  by  supporting  the  analysis  of  existing \n ", "  Appendix 8  69 \ncapacities for planning and budget management at city level, the development and pilot testing \nof  revised  planning  and  budgeting  systems,  and  the  preparation  and  dissemination  of  city \nplanning guidelines. Attention will be paid to (i) the synchronization between city and provincial \nplanning systems, (ii) development of mechanisms to ensure citizen voice and accountability, \nand (iii) a comprehensive assessment of existing capacities and capacity development needs in \nselected pilot cities. The following activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  Review the planning and budget management systems for provinces and cities \nand identify capacity development support needs drawing on existing studies, if \nnecessary.  \n(ii)  Conduct a capacity development needs assessment on city planning and budget \nmanagement systems for up to three cities, utilizing tools that have been applied \nin other countries (such as Indonesia) and techniques that address institutional, \norganizational, and individual capacities.  \n(iii)  Drawing on the findings of the needs assessments and existing performance \nmeasurement  and  accountability  systems  (such  as  the  local  government \nperformance measurement system [LGPMS] and citizen report card surveys), \nrecommend improvements to the city planning guidelines to address identified \nneeds, and ensure citizen voice and accountability and gender mainstreaming by \noperationalizing  pilot  Local  Development  Councils  (LDCs)  with  women  and \nnongovernment organization (NGO) representation. \n(iv)  Provide on-the-job training to selected city government officials in the first round of \nimplementation of the revised guidelines.  \n \n5.  Refined  LGPMS.  This  will  strengthen  the  performance  management  system  by \nsupporting development of the LGPMS to be used as a tool to link access to intergovernmental \ntransfers, grants, and capacity development support with service delivery performance. The \nfollowing activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  Incorporate  new  local  government  financial  performance  monitoring  system \n(LGPFMS)  indicators  developed  under  the  Local  Government  Finance  and \nBudget Reform Project1 into the LGPMS manual covering both data capture and \nbenchmarks. \n(ii)  Utilize LGPMS results in physical planning and investment programming (NEDA \nProvincial Guidelines developed under the TA on Strengthening Provincial and \nLocal  Planning  and  Expenditure  Management,2 in  budgeting  (DBM  Updated \nBudget Manual), and financial resource mobilization (DOF). \n(iii)  Promote transparency on data gathering and utilization of LGPMS data through \nan annual LGU Performance Report similar to the annual financial performance \nreport published by the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF). This TA will \ndesign  an  LGU  Performance  Report  template  in  coordination  with  the  Local \nGovernance and Fiscal Management Project.3  \n(iv)  Utilize  the  LGPMS  to  develop  LGU  service  standards  useful  for  establishing \ninvestment priorities. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be DILG. A project steering committee will consist \nof  DILG,  DOF,  DBM,  NEDA,  and  representatives  of  the  League  of  Provinces,  League  of \nMunicipalities, and League of Cities. DILG will coordinate with DBM, DOF, NEDA, the LGU \nLeagues, and participating LGUs. The project steering committee will meet quarterly to review \nwritten assessment of implementation progress and recommendations prepared by a technical \nreview  committee  and  discuss  those  with  the  ADB  project  officer.  The  technical  review \ncommittee will also conduct the staff review of the TA\u2019s outputs prior to the workshop with the \nproject steering committee. \n \n9.  The Government will commit to the required counterpart funding in terms of the provision \nof suitably furnished office space, travel and meeting cost requirements not covered by the TA, \nstaff resources, and workshop secretariat support. The TA will be implemented over 18 months \ncommencing January 2008, with completion expected in June 2009. To implement the TA, the \nfollowing consulting services will be required: 95 person-months of national consultants in the \nareas of local governance and decentralization; LGU financial resource mobilization; public \nadministration  and  management;  LGU  performance  assessment;  LGU  cost  accounting; \norganizational  restructuring;  human  resource  management,  including  training  design  and \nexecution; development financing, policy reform and advocacy, liaising with different tiers of \ngovernment  (including  LGU  Leagues),  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  participation;  and \ninformation and communication technology. All recruitment and engagement will be undertaken \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time).  \n \n ", "72  Appendix 8 \n10.
