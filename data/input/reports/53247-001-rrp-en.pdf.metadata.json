Growing economic imbalances have led \nto  a  major  deterioration  in  external  and  macroeconomic  stability,  which  has  begun  eroding \neconomic well-being and social welfare through high inflation and falling real incomes, particularly \nfor poor and vulnerable communities. Pakistan\u2019s economic crisis has been caused by a rapidly \nexpanding fiscal deficit and public debt (para. 5), a large balance-of-payments gap and critically \nlow  foreign  exchange  reserves  (para.  7),  and  growing  losses  from  several  major  state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs)  (para.  11).  While  macroeconomic  fundamentals  have  been  weak  for  a \nsustained  period,  several  unanticipated  shocks  have  led  to  a  crisis  situation.  Since  mid-2018, \nPakistan\u2019s external account has been hit by a sharp drop in foreign direct investment and portfolio \ninvestment inflows (net) caused by an uncertain political and global economic environment.2 Net \nportfolio investment contracted by $1.2 billion in FY2019, a sharp turn from a net positive inflow \nof $2.2 billion in FY2018.3 Consequently, net foreign exchange reserves have declined by almost \n$3 billion, and as of June 2019 equaled just 1.4 months of import cover. \n \nThese  developments  caused  growth  to  slump  to  3.3%  in  FY2019,  well  below  the \n4. \ngovernment\u2019s target of 6.2%, and pushed public debt to 75% of gross domestic product (GDP).4 \n\n \n\n1  IMF. 2019.

Meanwhile,  with  limited  liquidity  in  the  domestic  financial  system,  the  cost  of \nservicing outstanding borrowing has continued to grow. The government\u2019s gross financing needs \nreached  34.0%  of  GDP  in  FY2018,  up  from  29.4%  in  FY2017,  crowding  out  fiscal  space  for \ncountercyclical investment and social protection programs. \n \n5. \nUnsustainable  fiscal  deficit  and  rising  public  debt.  Expansionary  fiscal  policy \nundertaken in FY2018 to boost medium-term growth and support populist measures led to a surge \nin  the  fiscal  deficit  to  6.6%  of  GDP,  2.5  percentage  points  higher  than  budgeted  (Table  1).  In \nFY2019, the deficit has expanded further to reach 8.9% of GDP, driven by high nondiscretionary \nexpenditure  as  a  result  of  poor  fiscal  planning  for  expenditure  allocations,  including  public \ninvestments, untargeted subsidies to lessen the social impact of high inflation, and rising security \nexpenditures.  Low  revenue  collection  is  also contributing  to  higher-than-expected  deficits,  with \ntax revenues reaching 11.6% of GDP in FY2019, far below the government\u2019s long-term target of \n20%  of  GDP.6 Excessively  large  and  frequent  tax  exemptions  and  concessions  and  weak  tax \nadministration  are  contributing  to  a  low  tax  base  and  low  tax  collection  rate.  As  a  result,  the \ngovernment  has  been  unable  to  meet  its  fiscal  expenditure  needs  within  a  sustainable  fiscal \nframework. The high fiscal deficits recorded in recent years have led to a sharp uptick in domestic \nand international  borrowing  and public  debt,  which  has  reached  75%  of GDP\u2014well  above  the \ngovernment\u2019s target of 60% of GDP. \n \nRising public debt, coupled with a depreciation of the Pakistan rupee, are also causing a \n6. \nsharp rise in debt servicing payments\u2014further eroding the fiscal space needed to address the \ncrisis. In FY2019, the total debt servicing costs of the government reached 5.2% of GDP, up from \n4.3% of GDP in FY2018. \n \n\nTable 1: Fiscal and External Sector Indicators, FY2016\u2013FY2019 \nFY2016 \n15.5 \n19.2 \n(3.7) \n(0.2) \n67.6 \n\nFY2018 \n15.2 \n21.8 \n(6.6) \n(2.1) \n71.7 \n\nFY2017 \n15.5 \n21.1 \n(5.6) \n(1.5) \n67.0 \n\nIndicator \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP) \nTotal expenditure (% of GDP) \nBudget balance, including grants (% of GDP) \nPrimary balance, including grants (% of GDP) \nGeneral government debt with IMF obligations  \n(% of GDP) \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP) \nCurrent account balance ($ billion) \nCapital and financial account balance ($ billion) \nConsumer prices (percentage change, end of \nperiod) \n\n(1.7) \n(4.9) \n7.1 \n3.2 \n\n(4.1) \n(12.6) \n10.6 \n3.9 \n\n(6.3) \n(19.9) \n14.7 \n5.2 \n\nFY2019 \n12.7 \n21.6 \n(8.9) \n(3.5) \n74.9 \n\n(4.8) \n(13.1) \n11.1 \n8.4 \n\n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance; IMF Staff Report. \n \n7. \nWeak  external  sector  performance  eroding  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Pakistan\u2019s \ncurrent account deficit has widened significantly, driven by a growing trade deficit and stagnant \ninternational  remittance  growth.  The  current  account  deficit  expanded  to  a  record  high  of \n$20 billion in FY2018 or 6.3% of GDP, from $5 billion in FY2016 (Table 1), and reduced slightly \nto 4.8% of GDP in FY2019. The trade deficit has increased rapidly because of stagnant export \ngrowth  combined  with  rapidly  increasing  imports  of  both  capital  and  consumer  goods.  Private \n\n5  The crude import bill rose by 56% during FY2018 as against 7% in FY2017. \n6  Government of Pakistan. 2019. Pakistan Budget Speech, FY2019\u201320. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nincreased  government \n\ninfrastructure  spending  and  past  attempts \n\nconsumption  accounted  for  81%  of  GDP  in  FY2018,  largely  supported  by  imports.  Therefore, \nincreased domestic demand from higher growth contributed to increased imports, with consumer \ngoods  making  up  57%  of  imports  in  FY2018.  Imports  also  increased  from  expanding  public \nspending on capital goods and infrastructure projects. \n \n8. \nPakistan\u2019s  export  to  GDP  ratio  of  8.2%  in  FY2018  is  the  lowest  among  its  competitor \ncountries and the regional average of 17.7%. Its export performance lags that of South Asian and \nSoutheast Asian comparator countries, some of which are relatively new entrants in key export \nmarkets, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Foreign direct investment in \nPakistan,  including  the  export  segment,  has  remained  relatively  low  at  less  than  1%  of  GDP \ndespite \nto  spur \ncompetitiveness.7 Exports remain concentrated in less-sophisticated, lower value-added products \nand lack the diversification that is evident in agriculture, textiles, and leather products. Exporters \nface weak institutional capacity for trade facilitation and related services. In addition, the levying \nof ad hoc trade taxes, i.e., customs and regulatory duties, which aimed to raise revenue during \nFY2015 and FY2016, has increased costs to exporters for imported machinery and intermediate \ngoods used in production. This has created a significant negative effect on the competitiveness \nof domestic industries involved in global value chains, and hence the total value of exports.8 \n \n9. \nTo protect the state budget from higher costs of imported capital goods and foreign debt \nservicing, the real effective exchange rate of the Pakistan rupee was allowed to appreciate by \nmore than 20% from 2013 to 2017, which further eroded export competitiveness. By maintaining \na mostly fixed nominal exchange rate against the United States dollar, the Pakistan rupee was \nestimated  to  be  10%\u201318%  overvalued  in  July  2017,  which  increased  demand  for  imports, \nworsening  the  current  account  deficit,  and  reduced  the  price  competitiveness  of  exporters. 9 \nDuring 2018, the Pakistan rupee was allowed to devalue by 25% against the United States dollar, \nwhich partially helped improve the price competitiveness of exporters. \n \nThe  widening  current  account  deficit  during  FY2017  and  FY2018  has  put  significant \n10. \npressure on the balance of payments, which has been worsened by insufficient net surplus in the \ncapital  and  financial  accounts  to  offset  the  deficit  (Table  1). 10 As  a  result,  Pakistan\u2019s  gross \ninternational reserves have followed a downward trend, from $19.4 billion at the end of FY2016 \nto $11.3 billion at the end of FY2018 and $9.1 billion in December 2018\u2014equivalent to 1.4 months \nof  import  cover. 11  Defending  the  overvalued  exchange  rate  and  increasing  debt  service  on \nborrowed  reserves  has contributed to  falling foreign  reserves.  The  devaluation  of the  Pakistan \nrupee in 2018 had limited effect on slowing the decline of reserves. Hence, given the sizable net \ndeficit across the current, capital, and financial accounts and subsequent falling reserves, large-\nscale increases in foreign borrowing (reflected in the financial account) are needed to maintain \nthe  critically  low  foreign  reserves  of  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP).  This  will  help  to  avoid \nfurther depletion of reserves in the short term, while structural reforms aim to reduce the current \naccount deficit. Sufficient levels of reserves are necessary to provide a buffer against external \nshocks and to avoid a balance-of-payments crisis. \n\n \n7  World Bank. 2019. World Development Indicators.

Accumulated losses of large \n11. \nSOEs have increased more rapidly since FY2017, adding further pressure to the government for \nproviding subsidies to ensure service delivery. Energy sector SOEs, which comprise about 60% \nof total SOE assets (Figure 2), have been a major driver of these losses. Following several years \nof steady decline in the flow of circular debt in the energy sector, a sharp jump in arrears and debt \nwas  recorded  in  FY2017  and  FY2018.12 This  was  caused  mainly  by  delays  in  adjustments  to \nplanned  tariffs,  prevention  of  planned  load  shedding,  and  the  nonpayment  of  subsidies  by  the \ngovernment as its own fiscal pressures mounted. In total, the energy and gas sector recorded \naccumulated debt equivalent to about 2.5% of GDP by the end of FY2018. When combined with \naccumulated losses from other SOEs, the total outstanding stock of SOE debt reached just above \n4%  of  GDP  (Figure  1).13 In  addition  to  nonpayment  by  creditors,  the  energy  sector\u2019s  financial \nperformance  is  constrained  by  several  structural  factors,  including  lack  of  corresponding \ndownstream  investments  to  augment  power  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  which \nhave caused congestion, inefficiencies, and high system losses that by the end of 2018 were 2% \nhigher  than  2016  levels. 14  More  than  a  quarter  of  electricity  generated  is  lost  because  of \noverstressed and dilapidated infrastructure, theft, and inadequate energy accounting. Moreover, \ndelays in undertaking important reforms in the energy sector, including the timely revision of tariffs, \nand  nonpayment  of  implicit  subsidies  have  contributed  to  arrears.15 Technical  and  distribution \nlosses  also add  to  the  circular  debt  of  the  energy  sector.  Eliminating  energy  sector  losses  will \nrequire a combination of new pricing strategies and sustained improvements in governance and \ninfrastructure.  \n\nFigure 1: Stock of  \nState-Owned Enterprises\u2019 Debt \n(PRs billion) \n\nFigure 2: Sectoral Classification of State-Owned \nEnterprises\u2019 Assets  \n(PRs trillion) \n\n \nGDP = gross domestic product, PSE = Pakistan Stock \nExchange, SOE = state-owned enterprise. \nSources: Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance \nand Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. \n\n \nDFI  =  development \ninstitution,  DISCO  = \nfinance \ndistribution  company,  GENCO  =  generation  company, \nNBFC = nonbank financial institution, SOE = state-owned \nenterprise.  \nSource:  Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Finance. \nFederal footprint FY2016.  \n\n \n\n12 Circular debt is payables from distribution companies to power generators and fuel suppliers.

The social impact of the crisis is not limited to the economic \n12. \ncrisis. The subsequent structural reform measures are expected to have short-term adverse social \nimpacts. For example, average inflation increased significantly to 7.3% in FY2019 and is expected \nto  rise  further  during  FY2020  (the  first  year  of  the  IMF\u2019s  Extended  Fund  Facility  [EFF]).  High \ninflation  was  primarily  driven  by  cost  push  inflation,  stemming  from  a  21%  exchange  rate \ndepreciation (from  July 2018  to  June  2019);  a  significant  increase  in  domestic  household  gas, \nelectricity, and oil prices; and a further increase in regulatory duties on imports. Together with a \n5.75  percentage  point  hike  in  the  policy  interest  rate  to  12.25%  in  2018,  these  factors  have \nimposed a major constraint on the business environment and massively eroded the purchasing \npower of low- and medium-income workers who are less able to protect their earnings against \nprice  increases.  Despite  a  decline  in  Pakistan\u2019s  consumption  poverty  rate  from  over  50.4%  in \nFY2006 to 24.3% in FY2016, multidimensional poverty is still high\u2014about 38.8% of people are \npoor,  with  stark  regional  and  urban\u2013rural  disparities  (54.6%  in  rural  areas  and  9.4%  in  urban \nareas). 16  Therefore,  the  social  cost  of  adjustment  is  expected  to  be  high  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable over the next 2\u20133 years, while weak growth prospects indicate economy-wide impacts \nincluding higher unemployment.   \n\nHowever,  the  decline  in  headcount  poverty  has  not  been  smooth. 17 On  average,  the \n13. \ndecline  was  slowest  during  FY2013\u2013FY2016.  There  are  several  reasons  for  this.  First,  higher \ninflation led to an accelerated erosion of the purchasing power of households, particularly fixed-\nincome  households.  Second,  lower  economic  activity  has  affected  employment  prospects, \nleading to higher unemployment rates. Moreover, for individuals already employed, slow growth \nin overall income has led to a slower or no increase in their income over the stabilization period. \nThird,  fiscal  consolidation  has  often  been  accompanied  by cuts  in  developmental  expenditure, \nwhich  adversely  affected  social  welfare  programs  in  real  terms.  Therefore,  ensuring  that  the \ngovernment  continues  to  finance  social  protection  initiatives,  with  improved  transparency  and \nbetter targeting, and without jeopardizing the broad fiscal consolidation framework, will remain a \nmajor focus of the current program. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n14. \nOn  3  July  2019,  the  executive  board  of  the  IMF  approved  a  39-month  extended \narrangement under the IMF\u2019s EFF for Pakistan for an amount of SDR4,268 million (about $6 billion \nor 210% of the IMF quota).18 The primary goal of the program is to restore economic sustainability \nand  lay  the  foundations  for  balanced  growth.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  proposed  reforms \nunder the program aim to (i) improve exchange rate management in the context of limited foreign \nexchange reserves; (ii) strengthen public financial management (PFM) to mobilize more revenue \nand restore the allocative efficiency of scarce public resources, and address the energy sector \npricing  issues;  and  (iii)  reduce  the  social  impacts  of  the  crisis  through  improved  targeting  and \ntransparency of existing social protection programs (Appendix 1). The government and the IMF \n\n \n\n16 Consumption  poverty  in  Pakistan  defines  poor  when  consumption  is  below  the  threshold  level  of  nutritional \nrequirements.  The  multidimensional  poverty  index  complements  consumption-based  poverty  by  reflecting \ndeprivations people face in other dimensions such as education, health, and standard of living. \n\n17 Headcount poverty in Pakistan is defined as the number of people below the consumption-based poverty line. \n18 Unlike regular IMF standby arrangements,  the EFF provides longer-term assistance in support of comprehensive \nprograms that include policies of the scope and character required to correct structural imbalances over an extended \nperiod  (typically  up  to  3  years).  The  EFF  was  designed  to  assist  countries  (i)  experiencing  serious  payments \nimbalances because of structural impediments or (ii) characterized by slow growth and an inherently weak balance-\nof-payments position. Pakistan\u2019s last IMF EFF program was undertaken from September 2013 to September 2016. \nADB provided regular program and project lending during this period but did not provide any dedicated crisis-related \nsupport.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nreached staff level agreement on the first review under EFF on 8 November 2019. It was reported \nthat  all  performance  criteria  for  end-September  were  met  and  progress  towards  meeting  all \nstructural benchmarks continues.19 \n \nTo support the implementation of the agreed IMF EFF milestones, the government has \n15. \nagreed with ADB on a subset of policy actions that will be completed by 31 October 2019 (Table \n2). This subset includes 11 policy actions that will contribute to attaining the IMF\u2019s three program \nreform  areas:  (i)  exchange  rate  management  strengthened,  (ii)  public  resource  management \nimproved, and (iii) social protection enhanced. Appendix 4 provides a complete list of prior actions \nand structural benchmarks that will be completed under the IMF EFF program from May 2019 to \nSeptember  2022.  A  description of the  reform  areas  and  policy  actions  supported  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) SPBL is provided below and summarized in Table 2.20 \n\n \nTable 2: Reform Areas and Policy Actions \n\nReform area 1: Exchange rate management strengthened \n1.  The State Bank of Pakistan moved to a flexible market-determined exchange rate to improve \n\nexternal imbalances (EFF prior action).  \n\nReform area 2: Public resource management improved \n2.  Parliament approved the Public Financial Management Law to improve the allocative efficiency of \n\npublic resources (additional action). \n\n3.  The government reached a formal agreement (memorandum of understanding) between the federal \nand provincial governments on fiscal targets to sustain comprehensive fiscal consolidation efforts \n(EFF prior action). \n\n4.  Parliament approved the FY2020 budget consistent with the International Monetary Fund program \n\ntargets (EFF prior action). \n\n5.  The government approved reform measures to strengthen the financial performance of state-owned \n\nenterprises including (i) the implementation of a quarterly automatic tariff adjustment in the \nelectricity sector by at least 10% to generate PRs150 billion in additional revenue and \n(ii) notification by the government of the gas tariff adjustment proposed by the regulator (effective \non 1 July 2019) (EFF prior action). \n\n6.  The Ministry of Energy prepared a draft comprehensive circular debt reduction plan to eliminate \nenergy sector losses and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance (EFF structural benchmark). \n7.  The government amended the law to eliminate the legal authorization for the executive to grant \nsales tax exemptions and concessions through statutory regulatory orders (EFF structural \nbenchmark). \n\n8.  The Federal Board of Revenue issued licenses for the implementation of the track-and-trace \nsystem for excise on cigarettes to improve revenue mobilization (EFF structural benchmark). \n9.  The Ministry of Energy issued a revised electricity tariff schedule for FY2020 as determined by the \n\nRegulator (EFF structural benchmark). \nReform area 3: Social protection enhanced \n10.  The government finalized the Benazir Income Support Program\u2019s banking contracts to ensure that \n\ncash transfers are more efficient and transparent (EFF structural benchmark). \n\n11.  The government approved a financial inclusion strategy for women to ensure the financial and \n\ndigital inclusion of the target group of women (EFF structural benchmark). \n\nEFF = Extended Fund Facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n19 IMF. 2019.  Pakistan: IMF Reaches Staff-Level Agreement with Pakistan on the First Review under the Extended \n\nFund Facility. Press Release No. 19/402. \n\n20 Policy  actions  5  and  6  in  Table  2  are  also  referred  to  in  the  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  1  of  the  proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan:  Energy  Sector  Reforms  and  Financial  Sustainability \nProgram, which is scheduled for Board approval in December 2019. This programmatic approach will allow ADB to \nprovide follow-up support for deepening of the energy sector reform initiatives supported under the SPBL. \n\n\f7 \n\n \n16. \nExchange  rate  management  strengthened.  To  correct  imbalances  and  support  the \nbuildup of reserves, the SBP has adopted a flexible, market-determined exchange rate.21 Coupled \nwith  a  tightening  of  monetary  policy, 22 this  reform  will  help  to  reduce  accumulated  external \nimbalances, provide a buffer against shocks, and support the rebuilding of international reserves. \nTo reduce pressure on exchange reserves, the SBP has agreed to limit its short swap and forward \nforeign exchange position. \n\n \nPublic resource  management improved.  Fiscal  reforms focus  on  reducing  fiscal  and \n17. \nquasi-fiscal deficits, supported by stronger revenue growth, to create fiscal space to support social \nand development spending. The agreed strategy aims to broaden the tax base and enhance tax \ncompliance to achieve a 4\u20135 percentage point increase in the tax to GDP ratio by the end of the \nprogram period. The approval of the FY2020 budget in June 2019 supports these objectives, with \nprimary  fiscal  adjustment  of  3%  of  GDP  underpinned  by  high-quality  permanent  revenue \nmeasures  of  1.6%  of  GDP.  On  the  expenditure  side,  the  budget  also  incorporates  implicit \nsubsidies in the energy sector that were not budgeted in the past and contributed to the buildup \nof  circular  debt.  Likewise,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  has  prepared  a  comprehensive  circular  debt \nreduction plan to eliminate energy sector losses and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. \n\n  \n18. \nThe adoption of the Public Financial Management Act in 2019 will increase fiscal discipline \nby  requiring  parliamentary  approval  of  supplementary  budget  authorizations.  Recent  legal \namendments will limit the use of Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) to emergencies, preventing \ntheir use (as in the past) for creating frequent tax concessions by waiving sales tax obligations. \nProvinces have agreed to contribute to the fiscal consolidation efforts by delivering surpluses of \nabout 1% of GDP in FY2020, gradually increasing to 2.7% by the end of the program. To support \nthese efforts, provinces aim to increase the collection of property and sales taxes and to assume \nmore spending responsibility. \n  \nSocial  protection  enhanced.  The  government  introduced  the  Ehsaas  program  in \n19. \nMarch 2019  to  address  poverty  and  inequality  comprehensively.  The  Ehsaas  program  was \nconceptualized to reduce poverty and inequality, support the economic empowerment of women, \nand promote income-earning opportunities in areas where poverty is highest. This program will \nbe delivered in part through an expanded Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), working \nwith international partners including ADB, which is responsible for the implementation of social \nassistance  programs  through  their  conditional  and  unconditional  cash  transfer  programs, \ncurrently  reaching  around  5  million  households  headed  by  women. 23  To  strengthen  the \ntransparency  and  efficiency  of  this  program,  the  government  has  finalized  the  BISP\u2019s  banking \ncontracts to make the disbursement of stipends more efficient. In parallel, the government has \nlaunched  the  \u201cone  woman  one  account\u201d  initiative,  which  will  ensure  the  financial  and  digital \ninclusion of about 5 million households headed by women under the program. \n \n20. \nComplementing initiatives under the ADB-supported component of the BISP program, the \ngovernment has agreed to undertake several other short- to medium-term initiatives to protect the \n\n \n\n21 As part of this policy reform, the SBP has noted that intervention may be necessary in certain situations to prevent \npossible overshooting or disorderly market conditions. At the same time, market intervention should not suppress \nunderlying trends and should be conducted in a manner consistent with rebuilding reserves. \n\n22 Since the beginning of 2018, the SBP has tightened monetary policy by more than 500 basis points. \n23 ADB. 2013.

These include providing a one-off disbursement of PRs1,000 to existing BISP \nbeneficiaries; boosting girls\u2019 educational enrollment by augmenting the BISP-provided Waseela-\ne-Taleem  conditional  cash  transfer  program  with  a  girl  bonus  of  PRs250  to  be  provided  on  a \nquarterly basis; and updating the National Socio-Economic Registry by the end of June 2020 to \nbetter reflect Pakistan\u2019s poverty structure and allow for the enrollment of new beneficiaries. \n \n21. \nThe  case  for  SPBL  and  ADB  value  addition.  The  special  policy-based  lending  will \nsupport  the  IMF  EFF,  in  accordance  with  the  eligibility  criteria  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Review  of \nProgram Lending Policies, which defines a crisis as a situation in which a developing member \ncountry (DMC) is facing unanticipated difficulties in meeting its payment obligations, external and \ninternal, and where a large IMF-led international rescue package is being mounted to help restore \nstability.24 This financial support is also important in ensuring that the government can accumulate \nsufficient  foreign  exchange  reserves  to  meet  its  external  account  requirements  and  to  prevent \ndisruptive cuts in development expenditure, especially those targeted at job creation and social \nprotection.25 ADB has provided both direct and indirect support to the preparation of the IMF\u2019s \nEFF  program,  leveraging  its  deep  policy  engagement  and  long  experience  in  designing  and \nimplementing  structural  reforms  through  a  series  of  programmatic  approaches,  covering  PFM, \nenergy and SOE reform, and trade and competitiveness. This has included technical assistance \n(TA)  and  policy  dialogue  to  support  the  implementation  of  reforms  to  improve  trade \ncompetitiveness (including tariff rationalization and strengthening of institutions to facilitate trade) \nand  to  strengthen  tax  administration. 26  ADB  has  also  provided  targeted  TA  to  support  the \nimplementation of energy sector reforms, including improvements in governance and technical \nefficiency  and  financial  sector  development.  In  addition  to  leveraging  its  long-standing  sector \ntechnical engagement, ADB has supported the preparation of the IMF EFF program by (i) closely \nparticipating with other development partners, especially the IMF and the World Bank, to finalize \na unified reform package with the government; and (ii) supporting the ongoing implementation of \nthe  IMF\u2019s  economic  reform  program  by  facilitating  the  identification  of  key  reforms  and \ninternational good practices in several areas of economic management where ADB has ongoing \npolicy  dialogue.  ADB\u2019s  continued  support  for  the  BISP  (footnote  23)  is  also  critical  to  ensure \neffective social protection. \n \n22. \nSequencing of reforms. The support provided by ADB through the SPBL is sequenced \nas part of a broader package of financial assistance necessary to restore external stability under \nthe IMF  EFF  program.  Factors  contributing to Pakistan\u2019s  economic  crisis could be  aggregated \nunder two broad groups: policy distortions and structural factors. Policy distortions include, among \nothers,  an  overvalued  exchange  rate,  ad  hoc  tariffs  and  regulatory  duties  on  imported  raw \nmaterials,  incomplete  pass-through  of  high  international  oil  prices,  and  ineffective tax  holidays \nthat  have  affected  macroeconomic  performance  in  Pakistan.  Structural  factors  include  the \n\n \n\n24 ADB.  1999.  Review  of  Program  Lending  Policies.  Manila.  This  document  stipulates  that  SPBLs  are  expected  to \nprovide crisis support on a large scale and beyond anticipated levels indicated in country assistance plans (country \npartnership strategies). The eligibility is also conditional on a DMC being eligible for regular ordinary capital resources \nlending, and ADB support should be provided as part of wider financial burden-sharing across international financial \ninstitutions in providing large-scale support to DMCs during such crisis. The review emphasizes that ADB should \nadopt a flexible definition of crisis for the SPBL modality, noting that a complete listing of characteristics of crises can \nbe elusive as the historical record shows that each crisis may have some characteristics in common with previous \ncrises but may also have some new dimensions. \n\n25 To offset the worsening impacts of the crisis, the FY2020 budget, which incorporates financing from both the IMF \nand ADB, has increased expenditure on social protection from PRs127 billion in FY2019 to PRs193 billion in FY2020 \n(a 52% increase from FY2019). \n\n26 ADB. 2018.

Typically, the policy distortions are addressed \nfirst in the short term to stabilize the economy, followed by structural reforms that have a medium- \nto long-term horizon. \n\n \n23. \nAs  summarized  in  Table  3,  approval  of  the  IMF  EFF  program  was  conditional  on  the \nsatisfactory completion of four prior actions and agreement to complete 13 subsequent structural \nbenchmarks and was followed by the disbursement of SDR716 million in July 2019. In line with \nthis program, the approval of ADB\u2019s SPBL is conditional on the satisfactory completion of the four \noriginal prior actions plus an additional six policy actions in common with structural benchmarks \nof the IMF EFF program and one additional action. Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of documents \nreceived, all policy actions have been completed, including the actions that are a subset of the \nIMF structural benchmarks. Disbursement of the SPBL is expected to take place in  December \n2019, subject to the ADB Board of Directors\u2019 approval. The remainder of the IMF EFF program is \nplanned  to  be  disbursed  according  to  the  schedule  outlined  in  Table  3.  In  parallel,  ADB  will \ncontinue to provide ongoing budgetary support through policy-based loan programs for structural \nreforms  aligned  with  the  IMF  EFF\u2019s  program.  These  include  the  Pakistan  Trade  and \nCompetitiveness  Program,27 the  Pakistan  Energy  Sector  Reform  Program,  and  the  Financial \nMarket  Development  Program.

The  SPBL  forms  part  of  a  larger  assistance \nframework under the IMF\u2019s economic reform program. The government has played an active role \nin ensuring strong development partner coordination throughout the preparation of the IMF EFF \nprogram. ADB has also coordinated directly with the IMF and other major development partners \nduring the preparation of the SPBL. As a result of this strong coordination, the IMF EFF program \naims to catalyze total financing of about $38.6 billion over 3 years from Pakistan\u2019s international \npartners. 28  The  first  12  months  will  be  financed  with  support  expected  from  multilateral \ndevelopment  banks  and  bilateral  creditors  as  follows:  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \n$6.3 billion, Saudi Arabia $6.2 billion, United Arab Emirates (UAE) $1.0 billion, the World Bank \n$1.3 billion, 29  ADB  $2.1  billion  (policy-based  loans),  and  the  Islamic  Development  Bank \n$1.1 billion.  To  support  long-term  debt  sustainability,  the  government  of  Pakistan  have  also \nreceived  firm  commitments  from  key  bilateral  partners  (the  PRC,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  UAE)  to \nmaintain their exposure throughout the program period and to adjust the financing modalities to \nensure that the new financing is consistent with the program debt sustainability objectives, thereby \nensuring  a  manageable  external  debt  servicing  profile  beyond  the  end  of  the  IMF-supported \nprogram.  \n \n25. \nAt  a  sector  and  technical  level,  the  SPBL,  the  energy  sector  reform  program,  and  the \nrecently approved  ADB  program  on  trade competitiveness  have been  prepared in discussions \nwith  the  IMF  team  to  ensure  strong  alignment  with  the  reform  objectives.  ADB  has  also  had \nnumerous  interactions  with  the  IMF  team  on  specific  areas  of  the  EFF,  including  the  debt \nsustainability analysis carried out by the IMF; and sequencing and disbursement of the SPBL has \nbeen  coordinated  with  the  IMF.  ADB  continues  to  coordinate  efforts  for  improving  trade  and \ncompetitiveness with other development partners based on common reforms that are important \nto accelerate and sustain medium-term growth. \n \n\n \n\n28 IMF. 2019.

Washington, DC. \n29 The  World  Bank is processing  budget support  programs  using  its  development policy  operation  and  program  for \nresults modalities, which aim to (i) strengthen fiscal management, through the establishment of a Fiscal Policy Office; \n(ii) harmonize sales tax regulations; (iii) strengthen property valuation and tax collection systems; (iv) improve debt \nmanagement;  (v)  improve  the  business  environment  and  trade  competitiveness;  and  (vi)  facilitate  human \ndevelopment through education and health system strengthening. Over the next 3 fiscal years (including FY2020), \nthe World Bank proposes to provide $2 billion in budget support (DPL) and $1.4 billion in loans with disbursement-\nlinked indicators. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\nthe \n\nThe  program \n\nis  aligned  with \n\n26. \nfollowing  overarching  development  objective: \nmacroeconomic  management  strengthened  and  more  sustained  and  inclusive  growth. 30 The \nprogram  will  have  the  following  effects  of  the  reform:  sustainable  fiscal  position  with  reduced \nexternal  imbalances  achieved. 31  The  program  is  structured  around  three  reform  areas:  (i) \nexchange rate management strengthened, (ii) public resource management improved, and (iii) \nsocial protection enhanced. It comprises 11 policy actions, which the government completed from \nMay to October 2019.  \n \n27.  Macroeconomic  targets  announced  in  the  FY2020  federal  budget  on  11  June  2019, \nincorporating the economic reform program, are in Table 4. These targets include that, by FY2020, \nthe  government\u2019s  primary  balance,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  will  be  equal  to  or  greater  than              \n\u20130.4%.  Gross  public  debt,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  is  expected  to  reach  70.8%  of  GDP  by \nFY2023 and 67.1% by FY2024, from a peak of 80.5% of GDP in FY2020. \n \n\nTable 4: Fiscal and External Sector Projections, FY2020\u2013FY2023 \nFY2020 \n16.3 \n23.4 \n(7.1) \n(0.4) \n80.5 \n\nFY2021 \n17.9 \n23.1 \n(5.2) \n  1.0 \n78.0 \n\nFY2022 \n19.1 \n22.8 \n(3.7) \n 2.1 \n74.4 \n\nIndicator \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP) \nTotal government expenditure (% of GDP) \nBudget balance, including grants (% of GDP) \nPrimary balance, including grants (% of GDP) \nGeneral government and government-\nguaranteed debt (% of GDP) \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP) \nConsumer prices (percentage change, period \naverage) \n\n(2.6) \n13.0 \n\n(2.0) \n8.3 \n\n(1.8) \n6.0 \n\nFY2023 \n19.6 \n22.2 \n(2.6) \n 2.7 \n70.8 \n\n(1.7) \n5.0 \n\n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Government of Pakistan authorities and International Monetary Fund staff projections. \n \n28. \nStructural reforms under the program are expected to depress GDP growth temporarily to \na low of 2.4% and push inflation as high as 13% in FY2020. The social cost of this adjustment is \nexpected to be high for the poor and vulnerable, with weak growth prospects leading to economy-\nwide impacts including higher unemployment and lower purchasing power. To mitigate the social \nimpact of the economic crisis and the short-term adjustment costs related to the reform measures, \nthe  program  facilitates  measures  for  protecting  the  most  vulnerable  citizens,  including  an \nexpansion  of  social  safety  nets  and  increasing  federal  government  social  expenditure  by  52% \nfrom FY2019 to FY2020 with timely delivery of cash transfers to 5 million households headed by \nwomen. Over the medium term, GDP growth is expected to recover, rising to 5% by FY2023 with \ninflation easing significantly to 5% by FY2023. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n29. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $1,000,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the  program.32 The loan will have an 8-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3 years;  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a commitment charge \nof 0.75% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

The  government  estimates  that  it  requires \nabout $29.98 billion during FY2020 to alleviate external financing pressures and build the targeted \nforeign  exchange  reserves.  Of  the  total  requirement  during  FY2020,  the  IMF  will  provide \n$2.4 billion through the EFF program. ADB\u2019s SPBL, together with approved and planned policy-\nbased lending assistance (Table 3), will provide an additional $2.1 billion or 11.9% (Table 5) of \ntotal  financing  requirements. 33  To  ensure  that  medium-term  public  debt  repayments  remain \nsustainable, and that newly mobilized funds can be used to address the immediate causes of the \ncrisis,  the  PRC,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  UAE  have  also  agreed  to  roll  over  outstanding  public  debt \nobligations and a deferred oil payments facility equal to about $13.5 billion during FY2020. \n \n\nTable 5: Gross Financing Requirements and ADB Financing \n($ million unless otherwise mentioned) \n\nFinancing items \n\nA.

IMF  Country  Report.  No.  19/212. \nWashington, DC; and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n31. \nAssessment  of  ADB  risk-bearing  capacity.  The  SPBL  is  within  ADB\u2019s  risk-bearing \ncapacity, not constraining future ADB-wide lending operations at the current Pakistan sovereign \nratio rating of SO11 (B-). If Pakistan were downgraded to SO12 (CCC+) or SO13 (CCC/CC/C), \nthen ADB might need to restrain future regular ordinary capital resources allocations to Pakistan \nto prevent a breach in the capital utilization ratio threshold of 90%. \n \n32. \nFinancing terms. The pricing and terms of the SPBL are broadly comparable with those \nbeing offered under the IMF EFF program. The IMF EFF pricing and terms are based on the IMF\u2019s \nmarket-related  interest  rate,  known  as  the  basic  rate  of  charge,  which  is  linked  to  the  special \ndrawing rights (SDR) interest rate. The current basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate plus \n\n33 Complementing these budget support programs, ADB\u2019s investment project commitments are expected to be about \n\n$550 million\u2013$600 million during FY2020. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\n100 basis points. The SDR interest rate is 0.76% as of 7 November 2019. Large loans carry a \nsurcharge  of  200  basis  points,  paid  on  the  amount  of  credit  outstanding  above  187.5%  of  the \nquota. If credit remains above 187.5% of the quota after 51 months, this surcharge rises to 300 \nbasis points, and is designed to discourage large and prolonged use of IMF resources. The IMF \nEFF has a maturity of 12 years, including a grace period of up to 4.5 years. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  program.  The \n33. \nimplementing agencies are the Federal Board of Revenue, MOE, MOF, and SBP. The SPBL will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). The program was implemented over 6 months (1 May\u201331 October 2019). The loan \nclosing date will be 30 June 2020. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nGovernance \n\n34. \nThe  enactment  of  the  Public  Financial  Management  Act  on  1  July  2019  as  part  of  the \nFY2020 Finance Act, if implemented well, will introduce PFM reforms to improve fiscal discipline \nand  reduce  governance  risks.  Overall,  provisions  in  the  act  will  embed  stronger  practices, \ntransparency,  and  confidence  in  the  use  of  budget  resources  by+  requiring  parliamentary \napproval of budget authorizations during the fiscal year. Other recent legal amendments will limit \nthe use of SROs, previously used to grant discretionary tax exemptions and concessions. PFM \nreforms planned by the government will also introduce a fiscal risk unit in the MOF to identify and \nmonitor fiscal risks, including from SOEs, public\u2013private partnerships, and development projects; \nand  create  a  treasury  office  in  the  MOF  responsible  for  commitment  controls  and  cash \nmanagement. However, the risk of fiscal slippages and resistance to some of the fiscal measures \ncould undermine the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation strategy, putting debt sustainability at risk. \nVested interests may oppose progress in governance, weakening structural reforms and medium-\nterm  growth  prospects.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  ADB,  through  various  policy-based  loans,  is \nproviding TA on lasting governance reforms and institutional building, including PFM and SOE \nreforms  in  the  energy  sector.  The  focus  of  the  SPBL  (and  broader  donor  initiatives)  on \nstrengthening  social  protection  programs  and  expenditures  is  also  expected  to  gain  political \nsupport to implement the ambitious policy measures. The government is enhancing the use of \nanti-money-laundering  tools  to  support  anticorruption  efforts  and  ensure  that  banks  and  other \nreporting  institutions  improve  their  ability  to  identify  politically  exposed  persons  and  apply \nenhanced due diligence measures. The government plans further outreach to banks and other \nreporting institutions in complying with obligations to file suspicious transaction reports; and plans \nto allocate sufficient resources to the Financial Monitoring Unit to improve the dissemination of \nfinancial intelligence used to support corruption investigations. Pakistan is on the Financial Action \nTask Force (FATF) grey list and will continue to implement the anti-money laundering and counter \nterrorism reforms agreed in the action plan with FATF.  Last but not least, these initiatives are \nsupported by changes in the leadership positions of some key institutions. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n35. \nA  two-pronged  approach  is  needed  to  address  the  social  cost  of  crisis  and  structural \nadjustment.  First,  the  financing  support  is  critical  to  operationalize  targeted  social  protection \nprograms  to  moderate  the  impact  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  (para.  13).  Second,  helping  the \ngovernment  to  identify  and  implement  important  policy  actions  to  enhance  social  protection  is \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nequally important. These two initiatives, in turn, will help the government to complete the proposed \nreforms  uninterrupted.  In  parallel  to  the  IMF  EFF  program,  the  government  has  embarked  on \nmajor initiatives to make growth equitable and inclusive. It launched the Ehsaas program to scale \nup social protection that includes the financial and digital inclusion of about 5 million households \nheaded by women, housing, health insurance, and welfare program for the poor and people with \ndisabilities. The SPBL will share the financial burden for implementing these schemes.  Moreover, \ntargeted gender-related actions have been incorporated to strengthen the implementation of the \nEhsaas program. First, improved access to finance women entrepreneurs will have a significant \nimpact  on  women.  Research  shows  that  women  entrepreneurs  lack  access  to  basic  banking \nservices. The loan will address this issue and facilitate  improved financial inclusion of women. \nSecond, support for a new banking contract for cash transfers under the BISP34 is expected to \nmake cash transfers to women swift, transparent, and safe.35 ADB continues to provide support \nto the BISP through other programs as well (footnote 23). Moreover, improved growth, attributed \nto  structural  reforms,  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  employment  opportunities  and  income \npoverty, especially in a situation of rising inflation. \n \nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nThe  loan  is  categorized  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples. The policy actions are not expected to cause land acquisition or adverse impacts to the \nenvironment  or  indigenous  peoples.  Investment  activities  prohibited  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) will be excluded. \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.36 \n \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFiscal slippages and low fiscal headroom \ndue to resistance by stakeholders force the \ngovernment to cut social sector \nexpenditure. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nADB, along with other donors, and the \ndevelopment partners (including IMF), continue \nto engage with the government to finance \nsocial sector developmental expenditure. ADB \nshould continue to provide support for long-\nterm governance reforms through TAs under \nvarious policy-based loans. \nContinuous technical and policy engagement \nby ADB and other development partners, \nincluding IMF, with the government \n\nThe government lacks the technical \nexpertise for program implementation, \ncausing incomplete reforms. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IMF = International Monetary Fund, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n34 The BISP is an integral part of the Ehsaas program. \n35 The BISP is the most extensive social safety program and largest unconditional cash transfer program in South Asia. \nIt was launched in 2008 by the Government of Pakistan. The program targets women (as the head of the families) \nthrough  direct  unconditional  cash  transfers.  The  BISP  influenced  a  change  in  the  perception  of  women  in  the \nhousehold and the community. I. Cheema et al. 2016. Benazir Income Support Programme: Final Impact Evaluation \nReport.
