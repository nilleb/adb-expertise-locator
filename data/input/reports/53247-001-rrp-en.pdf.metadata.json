THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed special \npolicy-based loan (SPBL) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Economic Stabilization \nProgram. \n \n2.  The SPBL is part of a comprehensive multidonor economic reform program led by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and will help the Government of Pakistan to mitigate the \nsignificant negative economic and social impacts of an extraordinary macroeconomic crisis.1 The \nproposed economic reform program of the IMF will (i) introduce important fiscal consolidation \nmeasures,  led  by  revenue  mobilization  measures,  to  ensure  sustainable  public  debt; \n(ii) implement a tight monetary policy and a flexible market-determined exchange rate to reduce \nthe current account deficit and moderate inflation; (iii) facilitate structural reforms in the energy \nsector, institutions, and governance to ensure high and inclusive growth; and (iv) augment social \nsector spending to minimize the effect of the reforms on the poor. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Weak  macroeconomic  fundamentals  undermined  by  unanticipated  shocks. \nPakistan\u2019s economy, with a history of boom-and-bust economic cycles, has reached a tipping \npoint where economic and financial stability are at risk. Growing economic imbalances have led \nto a major deterioration in external and macroeconomic stability, which has begun eroding \neconomic well-being and social welfare through high inflation and falling real incomes, particularly \nfor poor and vulnerable communities. Pakistan\u2019s economic crisis has been caused by a rapidly \nexpanding fiscal deficit and public debt (para. 5), a large balance-of-payments gap and critically \nlow foreign exchange reserves (para. 7), and growing losses from several major state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) (para. 11). While macroeconomic fundamentals have been weak for a \nsustained period, several unanticipated shocks have led to a crisis situation. Since mid-2018, \nPakistan\u2019s external account has been hit by a sharp drop in foreign direct investment and portfolio \ninvestment inflows (net) caused by an uncertain political and global economic environment.2 Net \nportfolio investment contracted by $1.2 billion in FY2019, a sharp turn from a net positive inflow \nof $2.2 billion in FY2018.3 Consequently, net foreign exchange reserves have declined by almost \n$3 billion, and as of June 2019 equaled just 1.4 months of import cover. \n \n4.  These  developments  caused  growth  to  slump  to  3.3%  in  FY2019,  well  below  the \ngovernment\u2019s target of 6.2%, and pushed public debt to 75% of gross domestic product (GDP).4 \n \n1  IMF. 2019.

These include political instability, the \nlaw-and-order situation, economic performance and policies, and lack of infrastructure. A. H. Khan and Y.-H. Kim. \n1999.

Meanwhile, with limited liquidity in the domestic financial system, the cost of \nservicing outstanding borrowing has continued to grow. The government\u2019s gross financing needs \nreached 34.0% of GDP in FY2018, up from 29.4% in FY2017, crowding out fiscal space for \ncountercyclical investment and social protection programs. \n \n5.  Unsustainable  fiscal  deficit  and  rising  public  debt.  Expansionary  fiscal  policy \nundertaken in FY2018 to boost medium-term growth and support populist measures led to a surge \nin the fiscal deficit to 6.6% of GDP, 2.5 percentage points higher than budgeted (Table 1). In \nFY2019, the deficit has expanded further to reach 8.9% of GDP, driven by high nondiscretionary \nexpenditure as a result of poor fiscal planning for expenditure allocations, including public \ninvestments, untargeted subsidies to lessen the social impact of high inflation, and rising security \nexpenditures. Low revenue collection is also contributing to higher-than-expected deficits, with \ntax revenues reaching 11.6% of GDP in FY2019, far below the government\u2019s long-term target of \n20% of GDP.6 Excessively large and frequent tax exemptions and concessions and weak tax \nadministration are contributing to a low tax base and low tax collection rate. As a result, the \ngovernment has been unable to meet its fiscal expenditure needs within a sustainable fiscal \nframework. The high fiscal deficits recorded in recent years have led to a sharp uptick in domestic \nand international borrowing and public debt, which has reached 75% of GDP\u2014well above the \ngovernment\u2019s target of 60% of GDP. \n \n6.  Rising public debt, coupled with a depreciation of the Pakistan rupee, are also causing a \nsharp rise in debt servicing payments\u2014further eroding the fiscal space needed to address the \ncrisis. In FY2019, the total debt servicing costs of the government reached 5.2% of GDP, up from \n4.3% of GDP in FY2018. \n \nTable 1: Fiscal and External Sector Indicators, FY2016\u2013FY2019 \nIndicator  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019 \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP)  15.5  15.5  15.2  12.7 \nTotal expenditure (% of GDP)  19.2  21.1  21.8  21.6 \nBudget balance, including grants (% of GDP)  (3.7)  (5.6)  (6.6)  (8.9) \nPrimary balance, including grants (% of GDP)  (0.2)  (1.5)  (2.1)  (3.5) \nGeneral government debt with IMF obligations   67.6  67.0  71.7  74.9 \n(% of GDP) \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  (1.7)  (4.1)  (6.3)  (4.8) \nCurrent account balance ($ billion)  (4.9)  (12.6)  (19.9)  (13.1) \nCapital and financial account balance ($ billion)  7.1  10.6  14.7  11.1 \nConsumer prices (percentage change, end of  3.2  3.9  5.2  8.4 \nperiod) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance; IMF Staff Report. \n \n7.  Weak external sector performance eroding foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan\u2019s \ncurrent account deficit has widened significantly, driven by a growing trade deficit and stagnant \ninternational  remittance  growth.  The  current  account  deficit  expanded  to  a  record  high  of \n$20 billion in FY2018 or 6.3% of GDP, from $5 billion in FY2016 (Table 1), and reduced slightly \nto 4.8% of GDP in FY2019. The trade deficit has increased rapidly because of stagnant export \ngrowth combined with rapidly increasing imports of both capital and consumer goods. Private \n \n5  The crude import bill rose by 56% during FY2018 as against 7% in FY2017. \n6  Government of Pakistan. 2019. Pakistan Budget Speech, FY2019\u201320. Islamabad. ", "3 \nconsumption accounted for 81% of GDP in FY2018, largely supported by imports. Therefore, \nincreased domestic demand from higher growth contributed to increased imports, with consumer \ngoods making up 57% of imports in FY2018. Imports also increased from expanding public \nspending on capital goods and infrastructure projects. \n \n8.  Pakistan\u2019s export to GDP ratio of 8.2% in FY2018 is the lowest among its competitor \ncountries and the regional average of 17.7%. Its export performance lags that of South Asian and \nSoutheast Asian comparator countries, some of which are relatively new entrants in key export \nmarkets, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Foreign direct investment in \nPakistan, including the export segment, has remained relatively low at less than 1% of GDP \ndespite  increased  government  infrastructure  spending  and  past  attempts  to  spur \ncompetitiveness.7 Exports remain concentrated in less-sophisticated, lower value-added products \nand lack the diversification that is evident in agriculture, textiles, and leather products. Exporters \nface weak institutional capacity for trade facilitation and related services. In addition, the levying \nof ad hoc trade taxes, i.e., customs and regulatory duties, which aimed to raise revenue during \nFY2015 and FY2016, has increased costs to exporters for imported machinery and intermediate \ngoods used in production. This has created a significant negative effect on the competitiveness \nof domestic industries involved in global value chains, and hence the total value of exports.8 \n \n9.  To protect the state budget from higher costs of imported capital goods and foreign debt \nservicing, the real effective exchange rate of the Pakistan rupee was allowed to appreciate by \nmore than 20% from 2013 to 2017, which further eroded export competitiveness. By maintaining \na mostly fixed nominal exchange rate against the United States dollar, the Pakistan rupee was \nestimated to be 10%\u201318% overvalued in July 2017, which increased demand for imports, \nworsening the current account deficit, and reduced the price competitiveness of exporters.9 \nDuring 2018, the Pakistan rupee was allowed to devalue by 25% against the United States dollar, \nwhich partially helped improve the price competitiveness of exporters. \n \n10.  The widening current account deficit during FY2017 and FY2018 has put significant \npressure on the balance of payments, which has been worsened by insufficient net surplus in the \ncapital and financial accounts to offset the deficit (Table 1).10 As a result, Pakistan\u2019s gross \ninternational reserves have followed a downward trend, from $19.4 billion at the end of FY2016 \nto $11.3 billion at the end of FY2018 and $9.1 billion in December 2018\u2014equivalent to 1.4 months \nof import cover.11 Defending the overvalued exchange rate and increasing debt service on \nborrowed reserves has contributed to falling foreign reserves. The devaluation of the Pakistan \nrupee in 2018 had limited effect on slowing the decline of reserves. Hence, given the sizable net \ndeficit across the current, capital, and financial accounts and subsequent falling reserves, large-\nscale increases in foreign borrowing (reflected in the financial account) are needed to maintain \nthe critically low foreign reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This will help to avoid \nfurther depletion of reserves in the short term, while structural reforms aim to reduce the current \naccount deficit. Sufficient levels of reserves are necessary to provide a buffer against external \nshocks and to avoid a balance-of-payments crisis. \n \n7  World Bank. 2019. World Development Indicators.

Accumulated losses of large \nSOEs have increased more rapidly since FY2017, adding further pressure to the government for \nproviding subsidies to ensure service delivery. Energy sector SOEs, which comprise about 60% \nof total SOE assets (Figure 2), have been a major driver of these losses. Following several years \nof steady decline in the flow of circular debt in the energy sector, a sharp jump in arrears and debt \nwas recorded in FY2017 and FY2018.12 This was caused mainly by delays in adjustments to \nplanned tariffs, prevention of planned load shedding, and the nonpayment of subsidies by the \ngovernment as its own fiscal pressures mounted. In total, the energy and gas sector recorded \naccumulated debt equivalent to about 2.5% of GDP by the end of FY2018. When combined with \naccumulated losses from other SOEs, the total outstanding stock of SOE debt reached just above \n4% of GDP (Figure 1).13 In addition to nonpayment by creditors, the energy sector\u2019s financial \nperformance  is  constrained  by  several  structural  factors,  including  lack  of  corresponding \ndownstream investments to augment power transmission and distribution infrastructure which \nhave caused congestion, inefficiencies, and high system losses that by the end of 2018 were 2% \nhigher  than  2016  levels.14 More than  a  quarter of  electricity  generated is  lost  because  of \noverstressed and dilapidated infrastructure, theft, and inadequate energy accounting. Moreover, \ndelays in undertaking important reforms in the energy sector, including the timely revision of tariffs, \nand nonpayment of implicit subsidies have contributed to arrears.15 Technical and distribution \nlosses also add to the circular debt of the energy sector. Eliminating energy sector losses will \nrequire a combination of new pricing strategies and sustained improvements in governance and \ninfrastructure.  \nFigure 1: Stock of   Figure 2: Sectoral Classification of State-Owned \nState-Owned Enterprises\u2019 Debt  Enterprises\u2019 Assets  \n(PRs billion)  (PRs trillion) \n \n \nGDP = gross domestic product, PSE = Pakistan Stock  DFI  =  development  finance  institution,  DISCO  = \nExchange, SOE = state-owned enterprise.  distribution company, GENCO = generation company, \nSources: Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance  NBFC = nonbank financial institution, SOE = state-owned \nand Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.  enterprise.  \nSource: Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. \nFederal footprint FY2016.  \n \n \n12 Circular debt is payables from distribution companies to power generators and fuel suppliers.

The social impact of the crisis is not limited to the economic \ncrisis. The subsequent structural reform measures are expected to have short-term adverse social \nimpacts. For example, average inflation increased significantly to 7.3% in FY2019 and is expected \nto rise further during FY2020 (the first year of the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility [EFF]). High \ninflation was primarily driven by cost push inflation, stemming from a 21% exchange rate \ndepreciation (from July 2018 to June 2019); a significant increase in domestic household gas, \nelectricity, and oil prices; and a further increase in regulatory duties on imports. Together with a \n5.75 percentage point hike in the policy interest rate to 12.25% in 2018, these factors have \nimposed a major constraint on the business environment and massively eroded the purchasing \npower of low- and medium-income workers who are less able to protect their earnings against \nprice increases. Despite a decline in Pakistan\u2019s consumption poverty rate from over 50.4% in \nFY2006 to 24.3% in FY2016, multidimensional poverty is still high\u2014about 38.8% of people are \npoor, with stark regional and urban\u2013rural disparities (54.6% in rural areas and 9.4% in urban \nareas).16 Therefore, the social cost of adjustment is expected to be high for the poor and \nvulnerable over the next 2\u20133 years, while weak growth prospects indicate economy-wide impacts \nincluding higher unemployment.   \n13.  However, the decline in headcount poverty has not been smooth.17 On average, the \ndecline was slowest during FY2013\u2013FY2016. There are several reasons for this. First, higher \ninflation led to an accelerated erosion of the purchasing power of households, particularly fixed-\nincome  households.  Second,  lower  economic  activity  has  affected  employment  prospects, \nleading to higher unemployment rates. Moreover, for individuals already employed, slow growth \nin overall income has led to a slower or no increase in their income over the stabilization period. \nThird, fiscal consolidation has often been accompanied by cuts in developmental expenditure, \nwhich adversely affected social welfare programs in real terms. Therefore, ensuring that the \ngovernment continues to finance social protection initiatives, with improved transparency and \nbetter targeting, and without jeopardizing the broad fiscal consolidation framework, will remain a \nmajor focus of the current program. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n14.  On  3  July  2019,  the  executive  board  of  the  IMF  approved  a  39-month  extended \narrangement under the IMF\u2019s EFF for Pakistan for an amount of SDR4,268 million (about $6 billion \nor 210% of the IMF quota).18 The primary goal of the program is to restore economic sustainability \nand lay the foundations for balanced growth. To achieve this objective, the proposed reforms \nunder the program aim to (i) improve exchange rate management in the context of limited foreign \nexchange reserves; (ii) strengthen public financial management (PFM) to mobilize more revenue \nand restore the allocative efficiency of scarce public resources, and address the energy sector \npricing issues; and (iii) reduce the social impacts of the crisis through improved targeting and \ntransparency of existing social protection programs (Appendix 1). The government and the IMF \n \n16 Consumption poverty in Pakistan defines poor when consumption is below the threshold level of nutritional \nrequirements.  The  multidimensional  poverty  index  complements  consumption-based  poverty  by  reflecting \ndeprivations people face in other dimensions such as education, health, and standard of living. \n17 Headcount poverty in Pakistan is defined as the number of people below the consumption-based poverty line. \n18 Unlike regular IMF standby arrangements, the EFF provides longer-term assistance in support of comprehensive \nprograms that include policies of the scope and character required to correct structural imbalances over an extended \nperiod (typically up to 3 years). The EFF was designed to assist countries (i) experiencing serious payments \nimbalances because of structural impediments or (ii) characterized by slow growth and an inherently weak balance-\nof-payments position. Pakistan\u2019s last IMF EFF program was undertaken from September 2013 to September 2016. \nADB provided regular program and project lending during this period but did not provide any dedicated crisis-related \nsupport.  \n \n ", "6 \nreached staff level agreement on the first review under EFF on 8 November 2019. It was reported \nthat all performance criteria for end-September were met and progress towards meeting all \nstructural benchmarks continues.19 \n \n15.  To support the implementation of the agreed IMF EFF milestones, the government has \nagreed with ADB on a subset of policy actions that will be completed by 31 October 2019 (Table \n2). This subset includes 11 policy actions that will contribute to attaining the IMF\u2019s three program \nreform areas: (i) exchange rate management strengthened, (ii) public resource management \nimproved, and (iii) social protection enhanced. Appendix 4 provides a complete list of prior actions \nand structural benchmarks that will be completed under the IMF EFF program from May 2019 to \nSeptember 2022. A description of the reform areas and policy actions supported by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) SPBL is provided below and summarized in Table 2.20 \n \nTable 2: Reform Areas and Policy Actions \nReform area 1: Exchange rate management strengthened \n1.

Parliament approved the Public Financial Management Law to improve the allocative efficiency of \npublic resources (additional action). \n3.  The government reached a formal agreement (memorandum of understanding) between the federal \nand provincial governments on fiscal targets to sustain comprehensive fiscal consolidation efforts \n(EFF prior action). \n4.  Parliament approved the FY2020 budget consistent with the International Monetary Fund program \ntargets (EFF prior action). \n5.  The government approved reform measures to strengthen the financial performance of state-owned \nenterprises including (i) the implementation of a quarterly automatic tariff adjustment in the \nelectricity sector by at least 10% to generate PRs150 billion in additional revenue and \n(ii) notification by the government of the gas tariff adjustment proposed by the regulator (effective \non 1 July 2019) (EFF prior action). \n6.  The Ministry of Energy prepared a draft comprehensive circular debt reduction plan to eliminate \nenergy sector losses and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance (EFF structural benchmark). \n7.  The government amended the law to eliminate the legal authorization for the executive to grant \nsales tax exemptions and concessions through statutory regulatory orders (EFF structural \nbenchmark). \n8.  The Federal Board of Revenue issued licenses for the implementation of the track-and-trace \nsystem for excise on cigarettes to improve revenue mobilization (EFF structural benchmark). \n9.

To correct imbalances and support the \nbuildup of reserves, the SBP has adopted a flexible, market-determined exchange rate.21 Coupled \nwith a tightening of monetary policy,22 this reform will help to reduce accumulated external \nimbalances, provide a buffer against shocks, and support the rebuilding of international reserves. \nTo reduce pressure on exchange reserves, the SBP has agreed to limit its short swap and forward \nforeign exchange position. \n \n17.  Public resource management improved. Fiscal reforms focus on reducing fiscal and \nquasi-fiscal deficits, supported by stronger revenue growth, to create fiscal space to support social \nand development spending. The agreed strategy aims to broaden the tax base and enhance tax \ncompliance to achieve a 4\u20135 percentage point increase in the tax to GDP ratio by the end of the \nprogram period. The approval of the FY2020 budget in June 2019 supports these objectives, with \nprimary  fiscal  adjustment  of  3%  of  GDP  underpinned  by  high-quality  permanent  revenue \nmeasures of 1.6% of GDP. On the expenditure side, the budget also incorporates implicit \nsubsidies in the energy sector that were not budgeted in the past and contributed to the buildup \nof circular debt. Likewise, the Ministry of Energy has prepared a comprehensive circular debt \nreduction plan to eliminate energy sector losses and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. \n  \n18.  The adoption of the Public Financial Management Act in 2019 will increase fiscal discipline \nby  requiring  parliamentary  approval  of  supplementary  budget  authorizations.  Recent  legal \namendments will limit the use of Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) to emergencies, preventing \ntheir use (as in the past) for creating frequent tax concessions by waiving sales tax obligations. \nProvinces have agreed to contribute to the fiscal consolidation efforts by delivering surpluses of \nabout 1% of GDP in FY2020, gradually increasing to 2.7% by the end of the program. To support \nthese efforts, provinces aim to increase the collection of property and sales taxes and to assume \nmore spending responsibility. \n  \n19.  Social  protection  enhanced.  The  government  introduced  the  Ehsaas  program  in \nMarch 2019 to address poverty and inequality  comprehensively. The Ehsaas program was \nconceptualized to reduce poverty and inequality, support the economic empowerment of women, \nand promote income-earning opportunities in areas where poverty is highest. This program will \nbe delivered in part through an expanded Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), working \nwith international partners including ADB, which is responsible for the implementation of social \nassistance  programs  through  their  conditional  and  unconditional  cash  transfer  programs, \ncurrently  reaching  around  5  million  households  headed  by  women.23 To  strengthen  the \ntransparency and efficiency of this program, the government has finalized the BISP\u2019s banking \ncontracts to make the disbursement of stipends more efficient. In parallel, the government has \nlaunched the \u201cone woman one account\u201d initiative, which will ensure the financial and digital \ninclusion of about 5 million households headed by women under the program. \n \n20.  Complementing initiatives under the ADB-supported component of the BISP program, the \ngovernment has agreed to undertake several other short- to medium-term initiatives to protect the \n \n21 As part of this policy reform, the SBP has noted that intervention may be necessary in certain situations to prevent \npossible overshooting or disorderly market conditions. At the same time, market intervention should not suppress \nunderlying trends and should be conducted in a manner consistent with rebuilding reserves. \n22 Since the beginning of 2018, the SBP has tightened monetary policy by more than 500 basis points. \n23 ADB. 2013.

These include providing a one-off disbursement of PRs1,000 to existing BISP \nbeneficiaries; boosting girls\u2019 educational enrollment by augmenting the BISP-provided Waseela-\ne-Taleem conditional cash transfer program with a girl bonus of PRs250 to be provided on a \nquarterly basis; and updating the National Socio-Economic Registry by the end of June 2020 to \nbetter reflect Pakistan\u2019s poverty structure and allow for the enrollment of new beneficiaries. \n \n21.  The case for SPBL and ADB value addition. The special policy-based lending will \nsupport the IMF EFF, in accordance with the eligibility criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Review of \nProgram Lending Policies, which defines a crisis as a situation in which a developing member \ncountry (DMC) is facing unanticipated difficulties in meeting its payment obligations, external and \ninternal, and where a large IMF-led international rescue package is being mounted to help restore \nstability.24 This financial support is also important in ensuring that the government can accumulate \nsufficient foreign exchange reserves to meet its external account requirements and to prevent \ndisruptive cuts in development expenditure, especially those targeted at job creation and social \nprotection.25 ADB has provided both direct and indirect support to the preparation of the IMF\u2019s \nEFF program, leveraging its deep policy engagement and long experience in designing and \nimplementing structural reforms through a series of programmatic approaches, covering PFM, \nenergy and SOE reform, and trade and competitiveness. This has included technical assistance \n(TA)  and  policy  dialogue  to  support  the  implementation  of  reforms  to  improve  trade \ncompetitiveness (including tariff rationalization and strengthening of institutions to facilitate trade) \nand to strengthen tax administration.26 ADB has also provided targeted TA to support the \nimplementation of energy sector reforms, including improvements in governance and technical \nefficiency and financial sector development. In addition to leveraging its long-standing sector \ntechnical engagement, ADB has supported the preparation of the IMF EFF program by (i) closely \nparticipating with other development partners, especially the IMF and the World Bank, to finalize \na unified reform package with the government; and (ii) supporting the ongoing implementation of \nthe  IMF\u2019s  economic  reform  program  by  facilitating  the  identification  of  key  reforms  and \ninternational good practices in several areas of economic management where ADB has ongoing \npolicy dialogue. ADB\u2019s continued support for the BISP (footnote 23) is also critical to ensure \neffective social protection. \n \n22.  Sequencing of reforms. The support provided by ADB through the SPBL is sequenced \nas part of a broader package of financial assistance necessary to restore external stability under \nthe IMF EFF program. Factors contributing to Pakistan\u2019s economic crisis could be aggregated \nunder two broad groups: policy distortions and structural factors. Policy distortions include, among \nothers, an overvalued exchange rate, ad hoc tariffs and regulatory duties on imported raw \nmaterials, incomplete pass-through of high international oil prices, and ineffective tax holidays \nthat  have  affected  macroeconomic  performance  in  Pakistan.  Structural  factors  include  the \n \n24 ADB. 1999. Review of Program Lending Policies. Manila. This document stipulates that SPBLs are expected to \nprovide crisis support on a large scale and beyond anticipated levels indicated in country assistance plans (country \npartnership strategies). The eligibility is also conditional on a DMC being eligible for regular ordinary capital resources \nlending, and ADB support should be provided as part of wider financial burden-sharing across international financial \ninstitutions in providing large-scale support to DMCs during such crisis. The review emphasizes that ADB should \nadopt a flexible definition of crisis for the SPBL modality, noting that a complete listing of characteristics of crises can \nbe elusive as the historical record shows that each crisis may have some characteristics in common with previous \ncrises but may also have some new dimensions. \n25 To offset the worsening impacts of the crisis, the FY2020 budget, which incorporates financing from both the IMF \nand ADB, has increased expenditure on social protection from PRs127 billion in FY2019 to PRs193 billion in FY2020 \n(a 52% increase from FY2019). \n26 ADB. 2018.

Typically, the policy distortions are addressed \nfirst in the short term to stabilize the economy, followed by structural reforms that have a medium- \nto long-term horizon. \n \n23.  As summarized in Table 3, approval of the IMF EFF program was conditional on the \nsatisfactory completion of four prior actions and agreement to complete 13 subsequent structural \nbenchmarks and was followed by the disbursement of SDR716 million in July 2019. In line with \nthis program, the approval of ADB\u2019s SPBL is conditional on the satisfactory completion of the four \noriginal prior actions plus an additional six policy actions in common with structural benchmarks \nof the IMF EFF program and one additional action. Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of documents \nreceived, all policy actions have been completed, including the actions that are a subset of the \nIMF structural benchmarks. Disbursement of the SPBL is expected to take place in December \n2019, subject to the ADB Board of Directors\u2019 approval. The remainder of the IMF EFF program is \nplanned to be disbursed according to the schedule outlined in Table 3. In parallel, ADB will \ncontinue to provide ongoing budgetary support through policy-based loan programs for structural \nreforms  aligned  with  the  IMF  EFF\u2019s  program.  These  include  the  Pakistan  Trade  and \nCompetitiveness Program,27 the Pakistan Energy Sector Reform Program, and the Financial \nMarket  Development  Program.  All  these  programmatic  approaches  will  support  the \nimplementation of key structural reforms over the medium term that will reinforce the objectives \nof the IMF EFF program. The timeline for the approval and disbursement of these operations \nduring FY2020 is outlined in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Proposed Sequencing of Budget Support Financing for Pakistan, 2019\u20132020 \n(ADB and International Monetary Fund) \nDate  Planned Program Approval  Planned Disbursement \nJuly 2019  Approval of IMF EFF program with agreed  $1 billion disbursed in July 2019 \nreform package based on four prior actions  following approval of the arrangement \nand 13 subsequent structural benchmarks to \nbe implemented from July 2019 to September \n2022 \nAugust  Approval of ADB\u2019s Trade and Competitiveness  $500 million disbursed after completing \n2019  Program  all the first subprogram policy actions \nNovember  Review of tranche 2 of IMF EFF program  $450 million is expected to be \n2019  disbursed in December 2019 based on \nthe completed first review. \nDecember  ADB Board of Directors consideration of ADB  $1 billion disbursement is expected in \n2019  SPBL based on 4 IMF prior actions, 6  December 2019, based on completing \nstructural benchmarks, and 1 additional action  the 11 policy actions and subject to \nBoard approval. \nDecember  Board consideration of ADB Energy Sector  $300 million disbursement is expected \n2019  Reform and Financial Sustainability Program,  in December 2019 against the \nSubprogram 1  completion of all first subprogram \npolicy actions and subject to Board \napproval. \n \n27 ADB\u2019s Trade and Competitiveness Program, approved on 7 August 2019, will support the implementation of the \nnational single window system, e-commerce facility, and Export Import Bank.

Development  partner  coordination.  The  SPBL  forms  part  of  a  larger  assistance \nframework under the IMF\u2019s economic reform program. The government has played an active role \nin ensuring strong development partner coordination throughout the preparation of the IMF EFF \nprogram. ADB has also coordinated directly with the IMF and other major development partners \nduring the preparation of the SPBL. As a result of this strong coordination, the IMF EFF program \naims to catalyze total financing of about $38.6 billion over 3 years from Pakistan\u2019s international \npartners.28 The  first  12  months  will  be  financed  with  support  expected  from  multilateral \ndevelopment banks and bilateral creditors as follows: the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n$6.3 billion, Saudi Arabia $6.2 billion, United Arab Emirates (UAE) $1.0 billion, the World Bank \n$1.3 billion, 29 ADB  $2.1  billion  (policy-based  loans),  and  the  Islamic  Development  Bank \n$1.1 billion. To support long-term debt sustainability, the government of Pakistan have also \nreceived firm commitments from key bilateral partners (the PRC, Saudi Arabia, and UAE) to \nmaintain their exposure throughout the program period and to adjust the financing modalities to \nensure that the new financing is consistent with the program debt sustainability objectives, thereby \nensuring a manageable external debt servicing profile beyond the end of the IMF-supported \nprogram.  \n \n25.  At a sector and technical level, the SPBL, the energy sector reform program, and the \nrecently approved ADB program on trade competitiveness have been prepared in discussions \nwith the IMF team to ensure strong alignment with the reform objectives. ADB has also had \nnumerous interactions with the IMF team on specific areas of the EFF, including the debt \nsustainability analysis carried out by the IMF; and sequencing and disbursement of the SPBL has \nbeen coordinated with the IMF. ADB continues to coordinate efforts for improving trade and \ncompetitiveness with other development partners based on common reforms that are important \nto accelerate and sustain medium-term growth. \n \n \n28 IMF. 2019.

Over the next 3 fiscal years (including FY2020), \nthe World Bank proposes to provide $2 billion in budget support (DPL) and $1.4 billion in loans with disbursement-\nlinked indicators. \n ", "11 \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n26.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  overarching  development  objective: \nmacroeconomic management strengthened and more sustained and inclusive growth.30 The \nprogram will have the following effects of the reform: sustainable fiscal position with reduced \nexternal  imbalances  achieved.31 The  program  is  structured  around  three  reform  areas:  (i) \nexchange rate management strengthened, (ii) public resource management improved, and (iii) \nsocial protection enhanced. It comprises 11 policy actions, which the government completed from \nMay to October 2019.  \n \n27.  Macroeconomic targets announced in the FY2020 federal budget on 11 June 2019, \nincorporating the economic reform program, are in Table 4. These targets include that, by FY2020, \nthe government\u2019s primary balance, as a percentage of GDP, will be equal to or greater than              \n\u20130.4%. Gross public debt, as a percentage of GDP, is expected to reach 70.8% of GDP by \nFY2023 and 67.1% by FY2024, from a peak of 80.5% of GDP in FY2020. \n \nTable 4: Fiscal and External Sector Projections, FY2020\u2013FY2023 \nIndicator  FY2020  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023 \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP)  16.3  17.9  19.1  19.6 \nTotal government expenditure (% of GDP)  23.4  23.1  22.8  22.2 \nBudget balance, including grants (% of GDP)  (7.1)  (5.2)  (3.7)  (2.6) \nPrimary balance, including grants (% of GDP)  (0.4)    1.0   2.1   2.7 \nGeneral government and government- 80.5  78.0  74.4  70.8 \nguaranteed debt (% of GDP) \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  (2.6)  (2.0)  (1.8)  (1.7) \nConsumer prices (percentage change, period  13.0  8.3  6.0  5.0 \naverage) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Government of Pakistan authorities and International Monetary Fund staff projections. \n \n28.  Structural reforms under the program are expected to depress GDP growth temporarily to \na low of 2.4% and push inflation as high as 13% in FY2020. The social cost of this adjustment is \nexpected to be high for the poor and vulnerable, with weak growth prospects leading to economy-\nwide impacts including higher unemployment and lower purchasing power. To mitigate the social \nimpact of the economic crisis and the short-term adjustment costs related to the reform measures, \nthe  program  facilitates  measures  for  protecting  the  most  vulnerable  citizens,  including  an \nexpansion of social safety nets and increasing federal government social expenditure by 52% \nfrom FY2019 to FY2020 with timely delivery of cash transfers to 5 million households headed by \nwomen. Over the medium term, GDP growth is expected to recover, rising to 5% by FY2023 with \ninflation easing significantly to 5% by FY2023. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n29.  The government has requested a regular loan of $1,000,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program.32 The loan will have an 8-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a commitment charge \nof 0.75% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

These funds will meet the government\u2019s \nemergency financing needs to prevent significant adverse social and economic impacts of its \nbalance-of-payments and fiscal crises and to build foreign exchange reserves. The proposed \npricing has taken into consideration (i) Pakistan\u2019s financing needs, (ii) ADB\u2019s risk-bearing capacity, \nand (iii) the terms offered by other multilateral creditors such as the IMF. \n \n30.  Pakistan\u2019s development financing needs. The government estimates that it requires \nabout $29.98 billion during FY2020 to alleviate external financing pressures and build the targeted \nforeign  exchange  reserves.  Of  the  total  requirement  during  FY2020,  the  IMF  will  provide \n$2.4 billion through the EFF program. ADB\u2019s SPBL, together with approved and planned policy-\nbased lending assistance (Table 3), will provide an additional $2.1 billion or 11.9% (Table 5) of \ntotal financing requirements.33 To ensure that medium-term public debt repayments remain \nsustainable, and that newly mobilized funds can be used to address the immediate causes of the \ncrisis, the PRC, Saudi Arabia, and UAE have also agreed to roll over outstanding public debt \nobligations and a deferred oil payments facility equal to about $13.5 billion during FY2020. \n \nTable 5: Gross Financing Requirements and ADB Financing \n($ million unless otherwise mentioned) \n2019\u20132020  2020\u20132021 \nFinancing items  (FY2020)  (FY2021) \nA.

The SPBL is within ADB\u2019s risk-bearing \ncapacity, not constraining future ADB-wide lending operations at the current Pakistan sovereign \nratio rating of SO11 (B-). If Pakistan were downgraded to SO12 (CCC+) or SO13 (CCC/CC/C), \nthen ADB might need to restrain future regular ordinary capital resources allocations to Pakistan \nto prevent a breach in the capital utilization ratio threshold of 90%. \n \n32.  Financing terms. The pricing and terms of the SPBL are broadly comparable with those \nbeing offered under the IMF EFF program. The IMF EFF pricing and terms are based on the IMF\u2019s \nmarket-related interest rate, known as the basic rate of charge, which is linked to the special \ndrawing rights (SDR) interest rate. The current basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate plus \n \n33 Complementing these budget support programs, ADB\u2019s investment project commitments are expected to be about \n$550 million\u2013$600 million during FY2020. ", "13 \n100 basis points. The SDR interest rate is 0.76% as of 7 November 2019. Large loans carry a \nsurcharge of 200 basis points, paid on the amount of credit outstanding above 187.5% of the \nquota. If credit remains above 187.5% of the quota after 51 months, this surcharge rises to 300 \nbasis points, and is designed to discourage large and prolonged use of IMF resources. The IMF \nEFF has a maturity of 12 years, including a grace period of up to 4.5 years. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n33.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  program.  The \nimplementing agencies are the Federal Board of Revenue, MOE, MOF, and SBP. The SPBL will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). The program was implemented over 6 months (1 May\u201331 October 2019). The loan \nclosing date will be 30 June 2020. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Governance \n34.  The enactment of the Public Financial Management Act on 1 July 2019 as part of the \nFY2020 Finance Act, if implemented well, will introduce PFM reforms to improve fiscal discipline \nand reduce governance risks. Overall, provisions in the act will embed stronger  practices, \ntransparency,  and  confidence  in  the  use  of  budget  resources  by+  requiring  parliamentary \napproval of budget authorizations during the fiscal year. Other recent legal amendments will limit \nthe use of SROs, previously used to grant discretionary tax exemptions and concessions. PFM \nreforms planned by the government will also introduce a fiscal risk unit in the MOF to identify and \nmonitor fiscal risks, including from SOEs, public\u2013private partnerships, and development projects; \nand  create  a  treasury  office  in  the  MOF  responsible  for  commitment  controls  and  cash \nmanagement. However, the risk of fiscal slippages and resistance to some of the fiscal measures \ncould undermine the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation strategy, putting debt sustainability at risk. \nVested interests may oppose progress in governance, weakening structural reforms and medium-\nterm growth prospects. To mitigate these risks, ADB, through various policy-based loans, is \nproviding TA on lasting governance reforms and institutional building, including PFM and SOE \nreforms  in  the  energy  sector.  The  focus  of  the  SPBL  (and  broader  donor  initiatives)  on \nstrengthening social protection programs and expenditures is also expected to gain political \nsupport to implement the ambitious policy measures. The government is enhancing the use of \nanti-money-laundering tools to support anticorruption efforts and ensure that banks and other \nreporting  institutions  improve  their  ability  to  identify  politically  exposed  persons  and  apply \nenhanced due diligence measures. The government plans further outreach to banks and other \nreporting institutions in complying with obligations to file suspicious transaction reports; and plans \nto allocate sufficient resources to the Financial Monitoring Unit to improve the dissemination of \nfinancial intelligence used to support corruption investigations. Pakistan is on the Financial Action \nTask Force (FATF) grey list and will continue to implement the anti-money laundering and counter \nterrorism reforms agreed in the action plan with FATF.  Last but not least, these initiatives are \nsupported by changes in the leadership positions of some key institutions. \n \nB.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n35.  A two-pronged approach is needed to address the social cost of crisis and structural \nadjustment. First, the financing support is critical to operationalize targeted social protection \nprograms to moderate the impact on the poor and vulnerable (para. 13). Second, helping the \ngovernment to identify and implement important policy actions to enhance social protection is \n ", "14 \nequally important. These two initiatives, in turn, will help the government to complete the proposed \nreforms uninterrupted. In parallel to the IMF EFF program, the government has embarked on \nmajor initiatives to make growth equitable and inclusive. It launched the Ehsaas program to scale \nup social protection that includes the financial and digital inclusion of about 5 million households \nheaded by women, housing, health insurance, and welfare program for the poor and people with \ndisabilities. The SPBL will share the financial burden for implementing these schemes.  Moreover, \ntargeted gender-related actions have been incorporated to strengthen the implementation of the \nEhsaas program. First, improved access to finance women entrepreneurs will have a significant \nimpact on women. Research shows that women entrepreneurs lack access to basic banking \nservices. The loan will address this issue and facilitate improved financial inclusion of women. \nSecond, support for a new banking contract for cash transfers under the BISP34 is expected to \nmake cash transfers to women swift, transparent, and safe.35 ADB continues to provide support \nto the BISP through other programs as well (footnote 23). Moreover, improved growth, attributed \nto structural reforms, will have a significant impact on employment opportunities and income \npoverty, especially in a situation of rising inflation. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n36.  The loan is categorized C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. The policy actions are not expected to cause land acquisition or adverse impacts to the \nenvironment or indigenous peoples. Investment activities prohibited under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) will be excluded. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.36 \n \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nFiscal slippages and low fiscal headroom  ADB, along with other donors, and the \ndue to resistance by stakeholders force the  development partners (including IMF), continue \ngovernment to cut social sector  to engage with the government to finance \nexpenditure.  social sector developmental expenditure.
