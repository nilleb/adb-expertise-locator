THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Southwest Transmission Grid Expansion Project. The \nreport also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund \nfor the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM); and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) for the \nSouthwest Transmission Grid Expansion Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants. \n \n2.  The project will improve the operational performance of the power sector and contribute to \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  target  to  achieve  electricity  for  all  by  2021  through                       \n(i) constructing (a) a 400/132-kilovolt (kV) substation at Gopalganj; (b) a 230 kV transmission line \nin the southern zone, from Barisal to Faridpur; and (c) a 400 kV transmission line in the western \nzone, from Bogra to Rohanpur; and (ii) implementing a capacity development program in the \nelectric utility industry to promote socially and gender inclusive growth. The project will use state-\nof-the-art conductors with higher power transmission capacity and lower energy loss in both the \n230 kV and 400 kV transmission lines.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bangladesh has sustained an average annual economic growth rate of 6.5% since 2007, \ndespite the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis.1 Bangladesh is now evolving into a middle-income \ncountry2 since its gross domestic product per capita has risen steadily from $1,110 in 2014 to \n$1,544 in 2017. The structure of the Bangladesh economy is gradually shifting from agriculture to \nmanufacturing and services. Poverty has been halved since 2000, and many of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets have been met. Building on these achievements, the government has \nset new priority targets to (i) accelerate the annual economic growth to 7.5% to move to middle-\nincome status by 2021; (ii) create jobs and support rural development to engender inclusive growth \nand poverty reduction; (iii) reduce poverty from 24.8% in 2015 to 18.6% in 2020, and extreme \npoverty from 12.9% in 2015 to about 8.9% in 2020; and (iv) reduce environmental degradation and \nclimate change vulnerabilities.3 \n \n4.  Despite its economic success, the country faces major challenges in its effort to maintain \nthe  growth  trend  and  move  closer  to  upper  middle-income  status  because  of  infrastructure \ndeficiencies. Addressing infrastructure deficiencies is therefore a top priority of the government. A \nmajor challenge is to provide modern and affordable energy services to those who lack access. \nInadequate energy could result in loss of productivity and competitiveness and become a constraint \nto faster growth and greater investment in the short to medium term. To mitigate this constraint and \nsustain the country\u2019s economic momentum, the government has prepared the Power System \nMaster Plan4 to increase power generation capacity, as well as improve and extend the power \n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. http://www.bbs.gov.bd/ (accessed 1 March 2018). \n2  ADBI. 2017. Working Paper Series: Middle-Class Composition and Growth in Middle-Income Countries. Tokyo. \nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/325056/adbi-wp753.pdf. A country is classified as lower middle-\nincome if its  gross domestic product per capita is between $2,250 and $7,500, as upper middle-income if it is between \n$7,500 and $14,500.  \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

Power System Master Plan \n2016. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \n \ntransmission and distribution network, with the aim of achieving universal access to electricity by \n2021. \n \n5.  The  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  characterized  by  recurring  shortages  of  electricity-\ngenerating capacity in the face of ever-rising demand in a growing economy. In fiscal year (FY) \n2015, per capita electricity consumption was 310 kilowatt-hours. This figure was lower than most \nother countries in South Asia, indicating that power sector infrastructure facilities require significant \ncapacity additions. In FY2017, peak demand was estimated at 10,400 megawatts (MW) while \navailable generation capacity was 9,479 MW. A significant amount of demand was met by supply \nfrom captive generation and load shedding.5 Existing generation capacity gradually retires and \nneeds to be replaced, while net peak demand has continued to increase; it is forecasted to exceed \n13,300 MW by 2020 and 19,900 MW by 2025. Further, the national electricity access in FY2017 \nmasks a stark urban\u2013rural disparity, with access to electricity at over 90% in urban areas and only \n40% in rural areas. Also, despite substantial improvement in operational and financial performance, \nweak financial management capacities of the sector entities and below cost-recovery power tariffs \ncontinue to impair the financial health of the sector entities. \n \n6.  Bangladesh\u2019s power generation expansion plan intends to provide the required generation \ncapacity to meet the increasing demand and the government\u2019s electrification goals, including \ndelivering services to those not connected to grid electricity (footnote 4). Further, Bangladesh\u2019s \nSeventh  Five  Year  Plan  (footnote  3)  envisages  an  integrated  development  strategy  for  the \nsouthwest region encompassing Dhaka, Khulna, and Barisal. The power sector will play a critical \nrole in realizing the government\u2019s vision for promoting economic and industrial growth in the \nsouthwest region. \n \n7.  The past sector progress comprises (i) creating an enabling business environment for the \nprivate sector, (ii) implementing power transmission interconnection with India, (iii) increasing clean \nenergy  investment  in  wind  and  solar,  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  transmission  network  to \naccommodate expected additional power generation capacity. The sector reform actions so far \nhave contributed to considerable achievements, including the following: (i) the establishment in \n2004 of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), and (ii) the approval in 2016 of an \nelectricity transmission tariff fixation methodology. There are still areas for further improvement and \ncapacity building, such as financial management and corporate governance in power utilities. \n \n8.  Despite improved efficiency from  power sector reforms, transmission challenges remain.   \nInvestments in network strengthening and measures to reduce nontechnical losses have resulted \nin a significant decline of overall system losses from over 30% of generation in the 1990s to 13%\u2013\n15% of generation at present. The number of interruptions because of transmission system issues, \nhowever, increased from two incidents in FY2016 to 15 incidents in FY2017, with the cumulative \nduration of outages more than doubling from almost 17 hours to 39 hours. Investments in the \ntransmission network are needed to reduce the number of interruptions and further reduction of \nsystem losses. Therefore, addressing deficiencies in the transmission network remains a top \npriority of the government. Investments in transmission infrastructure will also be essential to help \nBangladesh (i) achieve its goal of achieving energy security (in line with Sustainable Development \nGoal 7),6 (ii) accelerate its economic growth, (iii) improve living standards of its population,                       \n(iv) create meaningful jobs, and (v) attain upper middle-income status. A highly skilled workforce is \nrequired to modernize power infrastructure with advanced technologies. Utilities have not been \n                                                \n5  BPDB. 2018. Annual Report 2016\u20132017. Dhaka. Bangladesh Power Development Board estimates that load shedding \nat peak times in FY2017 was about 250 MW. \n6  Sustainable Development Goal 7 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.   \n ", "3 \n \nsuccessful in enhancing the capacity of current employees or acquiring new employees with the \nneeded skills to operate the power system effectively and efficiently. \n \n9.  To address the issues in para. 5, the government has formulated a strategy and set targets \nfor the power sector, as stipulated in Vision 20217 and the Seventh Five Year Plan (footnote 3). \nThese include, among others, (i) increasing generation capacity by 23,000 MW, (ii) reducing \ncombined transmission and distribution losses from 13% to 9% of generation, and (iii) providing \nuninterrupted power supply to industries, all by 2020. The project is also aligned with the Energy \nPolicy8 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020.9 \n \n10.  Inadequate  transmission  lines  and  substation  transformer  capacities  in  southern  and \nwestern regions are the main contributors to transmission bottlenecks. In tandem with increased \npower generation capacity, investments in the transmission network are required to address \ntransmission bottlenecks for the evacuation of bulk power from power stations to major load centers \nsuch as Greater Dhaka, Chittagong, and the southwest economic corridor.  At the same time, \nconstruction  of  new  transmission  lines  has  become  more  challenging  because  of  the  high \npopulation density and limited rights-of-way (ROWs). \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. The proposed Southwest Transmission Grid Expansion \nProject builds upon ADB\u2019s strong and sustained work in the power sector of Bangladesh and \nembraces ADB\u2019s sector knowledge and synergistic approach in developing all energy subsectors.  \nComplementing the investment in the recently-approved Rupsha 800-Megawatt Combined Cycle \nPower Plant in the southwest region,10 the proposed project will focus on addressing continuing \ndeficiencies in the transmission system and will enhance power transfer capacity to the load centers \nof the southern and western zones. The project will use advanced efficient conductor technology \nas  a  cost-effective  solution  to  allow  more  power  transfer  at  lower  energy  loss  in  the  new \ntransmission  lines.  The  project  will  minimize  the  ROW  requirements  and  mitigate  potential \nsafeguard issues.11 Further, the project will initiate a capacity development program focusing on \nnew technologies and trends in power systems, with an emphasis on gender and social inclusion, \nwhich will help the long-term sustainability of the Bangladeshi power sector. The project will also \nsupport further sector reforms by strengthening financial management capacity and governance \nstructure of the power utilities while accelerating transmission tariff approvals by BERC. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) national target of electricity for all \nachieved by 2021 (footnote 7), and (ii) combined transmission and distribution losses reduced from \n13% to 9% of generation, and uninterrupted power supply provided to industries by 2020 (footnote \n                                                \n7  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2012.

With this project, the primary economic benefit of the transmission \nnetwork in southern and western Bangladesh will be the additional power supplied to consumers \nfrom the current and newly established power generation facilities; these consumers would be \notherwise unserved. Further, the use of efficient conductors will reduce transmission loss. \n \n26.  In the economic analysis, all costs and benefits were expressed in constant 2017 prices. \nCapital costs and operation and maintenance costs were taken from the financial data, with \nappropriate adjustments exclusive of taxes and price contingencies. Components 1, 2, and 3 \n(leading to outputs 1, 2, and 3) were assessed to be economically viable when economic analyses \nof individual outputs were undertaken, resulting in economic internal rates of return of 17.6% for \ncomponents 1 and 2 and 16.7% for component 3. The overall project economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated to be 17.4%. The project\u2019s economic returns are resilient to adverse changes \nin input parameters, including a 10% increase in capital costs and operation and maintenance \ncosts, a 1-year delay in construction, and a 10% decrease in fuel price. The analysis demonstrates \nthe economic feasibility of the project. \n \n27.  The financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.16 All financial costs and benefits were \nexpressed in constant 2017 prices. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the incremental \ncosts and benefits of the project over the project lifetime. The incremental benefits for outputs 1\u20133 \nwere based on the incremental electricity transferred under the project assets valued at the \ntransmission services tariff set by BERC under the approved transmission tariff methodology.17 \n \n28.  An asset-based revenue model following the tariff regulation was used to determine the \nfinancial internal rate of return of the project. The weighted average cost of capital of the project is \nestimated to be 1.90%. The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return was assessed to be 3.46%. \nThe project\u2019s sensitivity to adverse changes in the underlying assumptions was assessed and the \nanalysis demonstrated that the project\u2019s financial viability is robust. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  PGCB is a public limited company incorporated in 1996 under the Companies Act, 1994. \nBangladesh Power Development Board, a wholly government-owned entity, owns 76.25% of the \nshare capital of PGCB. PGCB has the responsibility to own, operate, and expand the national \npower  grid.  It  has  been  the  executing  agency  for  several  ADB-financed  projects  since  its \nestablishment, and it has adequate capacity and experience to undertake the proposed project. It \nhas capabilities in public procurement and knowledge of ADB\u2019s procurement processes. \n \n30.  The financial management risk of PGCB is rated substantial, and PGCB has prepared an \naction plan to address this risk. Considering the volume of operations and future development \nplans, PGCB needs to strengthen its finance function, including by (i) appointing key personnel to \nits finance division, (ii) retaining adequate and qualified staff in its accounting department, and              \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2017.Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

PGCB has \nagreed to undertake all these actions. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PGCB. ADB has completed integrity due diligence on PGCB and identified \nno significant integrity risk to the project.18 The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Bangladesh is the eighth most populated country in the world, with a population of about \n162 million in 2017. About 64% of the population lives in rural areas and nearly 41% of the labor \nforce is engaged in agriculture.19 Extreme poverty has declined considerably in rural areas: the \nproportion of rural population living in extreme poverty dropped from 34.3% in 2000 to 12.9% in \n2015.20 The  main  drivers  of  this  decline  in  poverty  are  faster  economic  growth,  increasing \nurbanization, rising labor productivity and wages, a shift from low-return agricultural labor to \nnonfarm employment, and growth in export industries. \n \n33.  Poverty and social. The major benefit of the project is enhanced energy security and \nadditional  electricity  supply  that  will  promote  business  expansion  and  create  employment \nopportunities for local communities, including poor and socially disadvantaged people, during the \noperational phase. The project will also generate jobs for local communities during construction as \na direct benefit. Further, through a capacity development program funded by the proposed EAKPF \ngrant, human resources development in the energy sector will be improved. \n \n34.  Gender. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. Under the proposed \nEAKPF grant, the project will support about 50 students in universities and 30 professionals in \nPGCB to continue their education. Among the beneficiaries, 40% of the students and 30% of the \nprofessionals will be  women. This will directly support women\u2019s access to higher  education \nopportunities. Further, this component will increase women\u2019s participation in the energy sector and \nencourage socially inclusive capacity in the electric utility industry. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.21 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The project will not pass through any ecologically sensitive \nareas  and  will  not  bring  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. The IEE \nand environmental management plan propose mitigation measures to minimize effluent, noise, and \nwaste from the project that may impact the environment, health, and safety. PGCB will disclose \nany updates to the IEE resulting from some changes in project scope. The project will utilize \naluminum conductor composite core cable in the transmission lines under outputs 2 and 3 as an \nadvanced technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 174,595 tons of carbon dioxide-\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2003.

The project has been assessed for its risk and vulnerability to climate change \nimpacts, and design measures have been integrated to minimize these risks. The draft IEE report \nwas prepared from the technical due diligence and fact-finding mission. PGCB has implemented \nseveral ADB projects and has adequate institutional capacity and experience to manage the \nenvironmental risks through its project management unit. PGCB is committed to implementing the \nenvironmental management plan and submitting environmental monitoring reports on a regular \nbasis to ADB. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The substations and transmission line alignments \nhave been carefully designed to minimize land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The three \nsubstations require acquisition of approximately 40 hectares of land, and 266 households with \n1,183 persons may be affected by the land acquisition. PGCB has  identified  138 households with \n552  persons  who  are  expected  to  be  significantly  affected.  The  impacts  of  the  268  km  of \ntransmission lines are mostly temporary, but some are permanent on the land along the ROW. \nAccording to the transmission lines route survey done by PGCB based on the preliminary design, \napproximately 919 households comprising 3,676 persons may be affected by the ROW, and among \nthem 77 households comprising 308 persons who own 89 structures may need relocation. PGCB \nwill try to avoid residential structures during implementation as much as possible to minimize the \nimpacts.  PGCB  has  undertaken  site  visits,  surveys,  and  necessary  due  diligence,  and  \ndisseminated relevant safeguard information during consultations and surveys. The resettlement \nplan was prepared in compliance with the relevant Government of Bangladesh regulations and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 16 April 2018. \nMitigation measures and budgetary provisions are in place to provide compensation at replacement \ncost commensurate to the impacts, and to restore livelihoods. PGCB has an environmental and \nsocial unit and is experienced in implementing ADB projects. PGCB will engage a nongovernment \norganization to implement the resettlement plan and retain an external monitor to verify monitoring \ninformation for the project. The monitoring reports will be submitted by PGCB to ADB semiannually. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). ADB and PGCB have conducted relevant due diligence \nand confirmed that no indigenous peoples, as defined by the Safeguard Policy Statement, were \nfound within the project area.  \n \nF.
