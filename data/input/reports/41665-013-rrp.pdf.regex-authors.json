I submit for your approval this report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, to be \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund (UEIF)1 under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility (UFPF), both to the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) for the \nWater District Development Sector Project. The report also describes proposed administration \nof technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the UEIF under the UFPF and by the Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF)2 for capacity building for \nwater district development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and administration of \nthe grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.3 \n   \n2.  The project will enable LWUA, a government-owned and controlled specialized lender, \nto fulfill its mandate to help less advanced water districts which operate outside Metro Manila. \nThe project will expand and rehabilitate water supply systems, build new sanitation facilities, \nand provide capacity development to strengthen the sustainability of LWUA and these water \ndistricts, and to promote sanitation partnerships with local government units (LGUs). Greater \naccess  to  piped  water  supply  and  improved  sanitation  will  reduce  water-related  diseases \ncaused by unsafe drinking water and the lack of sanitation facilities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Provincial water and sanitation coverage has not kept pace with the country\u2019s growing \npopulation and needs significant improvement. While over 90% of Metro Manila\u2019s residents \nhave access to piped water, it is estimated that less than half of the people living in provincial \nareas do. Sanitation remains a big challenge especially outside Metro Manila where there are \nno  significant  sewerage  systems  and  septic  tank  effluent  is  discharged  without  treatment, \nexposing millions to water-related diseases. Acute watery diarrhea is one of the leading causes \nof morbidity in the country.4 The Government of the Philippines seeks to catalyze urban water \nsupply and sanitation to improve health and living conditions and promote inclusive growth. \n \n4.  Sector  performance. Outside Metro Manila service is fragmented and suffers from \nweak planning, monitoring and investment. Water utilities are operated by a selection of service \nproviders, including (i) water districts, (ii) LGU-owned and operated water utilities, and (iii) \nprivate sector operators, mostly in urbanized areas; and (iv) community-based organizations, \nmostly in rural areas.  \n \n5.  Water districts provide about two-thirds of all provincial piped water connections and \ntherefore can play an important role in expanding coverage. Water districts are corporatized \nutilities that LGUs were encouraged to form under the 1973 Provincial Water Utilities Act. Run \nby a general manager and a five-person board of directors appointed by the mayor or governor, \neach water district must operate on a full cost recovery basis.5 The 1973 act also established \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Sweden. \n2  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  Government of the Philippines, Department of Health (DOH). 2012. Field Health Service Information System, \nAnnual 2011. Manila. \n5  An LGU forms a water district after analyzing, with LWUA, the water district\u2019s likely financial viability. The LGU then \nenacts a resolution to corporatize its water supply assets and secures a conditional certificate of conformance from ", "2 \n \nLWUA to help water districts develop systems and achieve sustainability through providing (i) \nconcessionary loans;6 and (ii) engineering, technical, and institutional development services. \nThe act allows LWUA to take over water district management under special circumstances, \npowers that LWUA has occasionally exercised to rehabilitate mismanaged districts.  \n \n6.  It is generally accepted that water districts provide better service than utilities run by \nLGUs and have demonstrated more resilience after disasters, with corporatization and LWUA\u2019s \nfinancing and technical assistance as key success factors.7 While a growing number of water \ndistricts have achieved scale and sustainability and can now access funding from government \nbanks and private sector banks, the majority of the 506 operational water districts are small, \nwith fewer than 3,000 connections and limited system coverage. Most small water districts \ncannot access funding from local banks, and rely on LWUA for technical, operational, and \ninstitutional expertise. Many small water districts are characterized by high nonrevenue water \nlevels, low efficiency and profitability, and weak institutional and technical capacity. The project \nwill  stimulate  water  and  sanitation  investments,  and  help  smaller  water  districts  expand \ncoverage, reduce nonrevenue water levels, and become more efficient.8 The project will enable \nLWUA to extend longer-term loans and build LWUA\u2019s technical capacity in sanitation, while \nwater districts will be able to borrow for the first time from LWUA to finance sanitation projects. \n \n7.  Strategic  context.  Water  districts  provide  an  established  corporatized  platform  for \nbroader  and  improved  water  and  sanitation  coverage  outside  Metro  Manila  to  help  the \ngovernment achieve its development goals for safe drinking water and improved sanitation, as \narticulated under the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 and its Midterm Update.9 LWUA \nis a focal point to facilitate this. The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) \nboard  approved  the  project  proposal  in  2014,  and  it  is  highlighted  in  the  government\u2019s \nRevalidated Public Investment Program.10 The project also supports the National Sewerage and \nSeptage Management Program, which aims to catalyze the installation of septage management \nsystems in all LGUs by 2020 and encourages LGUs to share costs with water districts.  \n \n8.  Assistance to this key sector is part of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy for the Philippines, 2011\u20132016.11  The project reinforces core principles in \nADB\u2019s water operational plan, 2011\u20132020,12 fostering corporatization and cost recovery, and \npromoting  sanitation.  The  project  meets  all  the  requirements  for  a  sector  loan:13 (i)  the \ngovernment has a sector development plan14 and the institutional capacity to implement it, (ii) its \n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe LWUA for the new water district to become eligible for LWUA\u2019s financial, technical, institutional development, \nand regulatory support.    \n6  Since 1973, LWUA has been funded mainly through loans from ADB and other development partners.  \n7  Most water districts\u2019 operations bounced back faster after Typhoon Yolanda because of (i) more climate-proof \nsystems, (ii) stronger technical skills, and (iii) LWUA\u2019s institutional assistance. LWUA\u2019s comprehensive damage \nand loss assessment within a few days demonstrated its technical and institutional capacity. \n8  For very small or less-viable water districts, the government will channel grants for these water districts through \nLWUA, and the project can fund the loan portion of such loan-grant funding. \n9  Government  of  the  Philippines,  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA).  2014.

The \nproject is in the country operations business plan for the Philippines, 2016\u20132018.15  \n \n9.  Previous ADB involvement and lessons learned. LWUA has a long history of working \nwith ADB. From the 1970s to the 1990s, ADB provided LWUA with loans for six investment \nprojects and funded five TA projects to finance water districts and strengthen institutions. Of the \nthree projects that were rated, two were successful and one was partially successful because of \ndelays  in  construction  and  a  lack  of  quantifiable  and  measurable  targets  for  project \nbeneficiaries. This project will provide implementation support to LWUA to avoid the delays \nexperienced previously. It will also fund a review of LWUA\u2019s corporate planning and asset \nmanagement to strengthen LWUA.16 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved living and health conditions for the communities outside \nMetro Manila that the participating water districts serve. The outcome will be increased access \nto safe drinking water and improved sanitation. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will finance water and sanitation investments that will improve public health \nin communities outside Metro Manila. The key project outputs are  \n(i)  the extension and rehabilitation of water supply systems of at least 20 water \ndistricts, including the two pilots (CKWD and MSFWD), and sanitation projects of \nat least four water districts (potentially including CKWD);17 and \n(ii)  capacity development and institutional strengthening for LWUA, selected water \ndistricts, and LGUs to address planning, financial and project management, and \noperations and maintenance capacity gaps.18 \n \n12.  LWUA will help the  water districts expand their systems and achieve sustainability, \nincluding  overseeing  the  design  of  proposed  water  intake  and  distribution  systems,  and \nsanitation facilities. LWUA will prepare feasibility studies and safeguard documentation for the \nadditional subprojects. Subproject eligibility criteria is in Appendix 2 of the project administration \nmanual (PAM).19 LWUA will also organize promotion campaigns and workshops to encourage \nsanitation partnerships between LGUs and water districts, and integration or cooperation among \nsmaller water districts. \n \n13.  Special features. In the Philippines, scale and regulatory risk (resource and economic) \nhave deterred more private investment in water and sanitation. While the government is working \nto establish a national regulator, corporatization continues to be the important first step for \npublic water utilities. The sector loan will strengthen water districts by funding expanded service \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n16 A project preparatory TA prepared feasibility studies and safeguard documentation for two pilot water districts: City \nof Koronadal Water District (CKWD) and Metro San Fernando (La Union) Water District (MSFWD). In August 2015, \nLWUA submitted to ADB a list of probable water subprojects totaling $60 million.  \n17 In 2007, following the government\u2019s request, ADB approved project preparatory TA for $1.5 million (including $0.3 \nmillion from the government). TA consultants were mobilized in 2008, five pilot water districts were selected and \nfeasibility studies prepared. The final report was submitted in May 2010. In January 2012, after the appointment of \nLWUA\u2019s new management, the government renewed its interest in the project. Of the original pilot water districts, \nCKWD and MSFWD remain. \n18 This output is financed by the TA described in para. 20. \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n \ncoverage and nonrevenue water reduction. The attached TA will provide capacity development \nto water districts and promote integration and cooperation among very small water districts. The \nproject will also demonstrate  the scalable national platform that LWUA and water districts \nprovide for sanitation investments: a 20% grant will be offered for sanitation projects, and the TA \nwill promote sanitation partnerships between LGUs and water districts.\n \n \nD.

Price contingencies computed at an average of 1% on foreign exchange costs and an \naverage of 3.9% on local currency costs; includes provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation \nunder the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \ne  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) loan has been computed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread \nof 0.5%. Commitment charges for the ADB loan are 0.15% per year, to be charged on the undisbursed \nloan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  LWUA has requested a loan of $60 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project. Loan proceeds will finance civil works, equipment, consulting services, \ntransportation  and  insurance,  contingencies,  and  interest  and  commitment  charges  during \nimplementation. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 years and a \nstraight-line amortization; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility;20 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (interest \nand  other  charges  during  implementation  to  be  capitalized);  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \n16.  The  UEIF  (footnote  1)  under  UFPF  will  provide  a  $2  million  investment  grant, \nadministered  by  ADB,  to  subsidize  new  sanitation  facilities.  Making  such  projects  more \naffordable and demonstrating sustainability will catalyze other sanitation investments.  \n \n17.

LWUA is the borrower of the ADB loan, which will be guaranteed by the Republic of the \nPhilippines. This loan will allow LWUA to onlend funds to small water districts, many of which \nare unable to borrow long-term funds or substantial amounts from local banks. LWUA intends to \nextend subloans with a term of up to 25 years (including a grace period of up to 6 years), at a \nfixed  interest rate  of  7.9%  per  annum.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n20.  The attached TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $500,000 will be financed by \na grant from the UEIF (footnote 1) under UFPF and $500,000 will be financed by a grant from \nthe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (footnote 2) under WFPF. ADB will administer both grants.23 The TA \nwill provide support to the project in order to (i) strengthen water district sustainability through \ntraining and promoting integration and cooperation among smaller water districts; (ii) promote \nsustainable sanitation partnerships between LGUs and the water districts; and (iii) prepare a \nstrategic business review of LWUA, strengthen its corporate planning capacity and redefine its \nrole in the sector, enhance its viability, and improve its accounting systems to address audit \nissues raised by the COA. LWUA will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  In designing sample water subprojects, wells have been sized based on daily peak \ndemand. Water  supply  facilities  primarily  consist  of  (i)  submersible  pumping  systems  with \nassociated back-up generation in wells with sustainable water yields, (ii) suitable chlorination \nfacilities for water disinfection, (iii) transmission and distribution networks with pipe diameters \nranging from 50 to 200 millimeters, and (iv) new service connections.  Improved sanitation in \nsample subprojects will be secured through a combination of (i) desludging of septic tanks with \nvacuum trucks (with standard capacities ranging from 4 to 8 cubic meters, for ease of access to \nthe household), and (ii) septage treatment facilities. The resulting effluent will meet Class B \nbody  discharge  standards  prescribed  by  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic  analysis. 24 The  economic  analysis  of  the  pilot  subprojects  evaluated \ntechnical options and confirmed that the subproject components are the least-cost options that \nsupport each water district\u2019s long-term development plan. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) was computed at 25% for CKWD and 14% for MSFWD, above the 12% economic \nopportunity cost of capital assumed by ADB. The EIRR remained above 12% for all sensitivity \nscenarios except MSFWD\u2019s worst case scenario (increased costs and decreased benefits). The \nEIRR would have been higher if other benefits were quantified (i.e., avoided morbidity and \nmortality from other waterborne diseases such as dysentery and cholera, income generated \nfrom the use of water for livelihood purposes, and the multiplier effect of increased income), and \nwould likely be above 12% for MSFWD\u2019s worst case scenario. The economic benefits of the \nwater supply subprojects include (i) resource cost savings on non-incremental water in terms of \navoided costs of producing, collecting, treating, and storing non-piped water because of a shift \nin demand to piped water supply; (ii) economic value of incremental water from the increased \n                                                \n23 This TA will finance the output described in paragraph 10(ii). Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n \nsupply; (iii) economic value of water that would have been lost for nontechnical reasons; and (iv) \navoided income loss including the value of time saved for not having to collect water from \nexisting non-piped sources, and productivity savings because of reduced incidence of diseases \n(but excluding income generated from the use of water for livelihood purposes and the multiplier \neffect of increased income, because of lack of data). Economic costs were derived from the \nfinancial estimates of capital investments and operation and maintenance costs after eliminating \nall duties and taxes, estimating the traded and non-traded components of costs, and multiplying \nthe  net  results  by  appropriate  conversion  factors  based  on  guidelines  set  by  the  NEDA\u2019s \nInvestment Coordination Committee: a shadow exchange rate for traded goods of 1.2, and a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.6 for unskilled labor.  \n \n23.  Financial  analysis.25The  financial  cost-benefit  analysis  of  the  pilot  water  districts\u2019 \nsubprojects confirmed their financial viability. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of \nCKWD\u2019s subprojects (water and sanitation) is 22.1%, exceeding the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) of 5.7%. The FIRR of MSFWD\u2019s water subproject is 7.1%. Sensitivity and risk \nanalysis revealed that the subprojects\u2019 FIRRs are most sensitive to changes in revenues (mainly \nfrom tariffs) and operating costs. Sustainability depends heavily on the implementation of tariff \nincreases,  the  aggressive  connection  of  new  customers  (for  water  subprojects),  and  the \ncollection of sanitation fees from customers who are not connected to the water system (for \nsanitation subprojects). Financial analysis also confirmed that the pilot water districts have the \nfunds necessary to finance equity, operation and maintenance of the completed facilities, and \ndebt service. To be eligible for financing, additional subprojects must demonstrate an FIRR \nexceeding the relevant WACC. \n \n24.  As part of due diligence, LWUA\u2019s financial condition was assessed. LWUA\u2019s profitability \nand leverage continued to improve in the 2014 fiscal year. It expects to operate viably in the \nnext 5 years by (i) reviewing its competitiveness to deter current borrowers from prepaying \nloans and attract new borrowers; (ii) more proactively managing nonperforming loans; and (iii) \nserving as a funding conduit for national government grants to smaller water districts and \nwaterless communities. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and LWUA. As a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC), \nLWUA is bound by the good governance commitments set forth in the performance agreement \ncontract between LWUA and the Governance Commission for GOCCs. \n \n26.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  LWUA  adheres  to  the \ntransparency and accountability elements of good governance. Although overall risk is still \nsubstantial,  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  project  are  adequate.  LWUA  has \ndeveloped reasonable institutional capacity to undertake international and national competitive \nbidding  for  civil  works  through  its  direct  participation  and  involvement  in  procurement  for \nprevious projects financed by ADB and other official development assistance. The assessment \nof the pilot water districts indicated more limited experience; assessments will be undertaken for \nother participating water districts. Capacity development assistance on financial management, \nfund disbursement, and procurement will be provided. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \n                                                \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Poverty  and  social  impacts.  The project will target less-resilient water districts. A \npoverty, social, and gender assessment was conducted under the project preparatory TA to \ndetermine socioeconomic characteristics and needs, as well as opportunities for participation for \nthe pilot area beneficiaries. The poverty incidence in the pilot water districts was 36% for \nMSFWD and 46% for CKWD, with a high percentage of households headed by women (19% \nand 34%). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been prepared to identify \nmeasures to enhance project benefits and mitigate potential risks or negative impacts to the \nproject  population. 26 The  project  has  two  main  poverty  and  inclusive  design  features:  (i) \nenforcing  LWUA\u2019s  lifeline  tariff  policy;  and  (ii)  ensuring  water  districts  have  initiatives  for \naffordable  access.  Sanitation-awareness  campaigns  and  pilot  facilities  will  reduce  the \noccurrence of waterborne and water-washed diseases and reduce associated health costs.  \n28.  Gender impacts. The project\u2019s gender action plan will facilitate women\u2019s participation in \nproject implementation (through the PMU) and in hygiene and sanitation training, and increase \nfemale representation on water district boards.27 \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) (SPS), as land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts are limited. A resettlement framework (RF)28 has been \nprepared, embodying specific requirements for all subprojects. A resettlement plan (RP) will be \ncompleted for each subproject with land acquisition and resettlement impacts financed under \nthe  sector  loan,  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  as  required,  during \nimplementation.  Due  diligence  has  been  undertaken  for  all  sample  subprojects.  Public \nconsultations were conducted and an RP was prepared for MSFWD\u2019s water supply subproject \nwhich involves land acquisition; initial costs for land acquisition and resettlement including those \nfor implementing the RP have been estimated and integrated into the project cost. 29 The RP \nfollows a process consistent with the SPS and Philippine laws and regulations, and ensures \ncompliance with them. In line with the RF, a due diligence assessment report was prepared for \nCKWD\u2019s subprojects, which concluded that no land acquisition or resettlement were expected to \noccur.  A  designated  officer  in  the  PMU  will  monitor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimplementation.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples, in \naccordance with the SPS. An indigenous peoples planning framework30 has been prepared to \nguide the preparation of an indigenous peoples plan, if required during implementation. \n \n31.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  as  the \nsubprojects are not expected to have any significant impact. An environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF)  has been prepared, embodying the specific requirements for all \n                                                \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Resettlement Plan: Metro San Fernando (La Union) Water District (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). The resettlement plan will be updated based on the detailed design. \n30 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nsubprojects to be financed under the sector loan.31 A designated officer at the PMU will be \nresponsible for the application of the EARF and ensure that (i) all subprojects are selected in \naccordance with the environmental criteria in the EARF; (ii) the screening is conducted and \nenvironment safeguard documents are prepared for all subprojects in line with the SPS; (iii) an \ninitial environmental examination (IEE), including an environment management plan (EMP) that \nensures mitigation of identified environment impacts along with related costs, is prepared, and \nthat the IEE is consistent and complies with the SPS and Philippine laws and regulations; (iv) \nthe EMP is updated based on the detailed design, and relevant provisions are incorporated into \nthe bidding documents; and (v) the implementation of the EMP is monitored and semiannual \nmonitoring reports are submitted to ADB. Public consultations have been conducted and sample \nIEEs have been prepared for all subprojects, each including an EMP that ensures mitigation of \nidentified environment impacts along with related costs. 32 \n \n32.  Adequate incorporation of environmental considerations during design, and allocation of \nsufficient budget will mitigate potential adverse impacts during operation. Effective environment \nand social monitoring at all stages of implementation will be ensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements, safeguard documents will be posted on \nADB's website. A grievance redress mechanism has been developed and included in the \nsafeguard documents to help to facilitate resolve complaints regarding project performance.  \n \nF.  Integrity \n33.  Integrity  due  diligence  has  been  conducted,  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of \nAnticorruption and Integrity, and information and clarification was obtained from LWUA and the \ngovernment. The assessment included past issues the government and LWUA are addressing; \nif the suggested robust measures are implemented and adhered to, they are unlikely to have an \nadverse effect on the project. Appropriate loan covenants have been included in the loan \ndocuments to mitigate integrity risks. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the risk  assessment  and risk management  plan.33 The  project\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLWUA and participating water  The  project  will  fund  a  review  of  LWUA\u2019s  corporate  planning  and  asset \ndistricts will not have sufficient  management.
