Agriculture has played an important role in Thailand\u2019s economic \ndevelopment, but it has also led to serious environmental and social challenges in managing the \nmass amount of residual waste that is generated from the harvesting process. The agriculture \nsector of Thailand accounts for approximately 10% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and \nnearly  40%  of Thailand\u2019s  population  depend  on farming for their main livelihood. Thailand is  a \nmajor producer of rice, sugarcane, cassava, rubber, and palm oil. Thailand\u2019s agricultural products \nare  estimated  to  produce  over  80  million  tons  of  waste  a  year.  Rural  households  utilize  small \namounts  of  agricultural  waste  to  provide  basic  energy  requirements  for  cooking  and  heating. \nHowever, the bulk of waste in Thailand is destined to be burned in the fields unless applications \nfor industrial use are sourced. Uncontrolled burning produces negative impacts on human health, \natmospheric visibility, soil, groundwater, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The challenge \nfor Thailand and many other developing member countries (DMCs) is to find a solution to manage \nand reduce the agricultural waste in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner. Waste-\nto-energy (WTE) technology offers an effective solution by converting the agricultural waste, also \nknown as biomass, into a dependable and renewable source of commercial electricity. \n \n3. \nThailand\u2019s natural gas resources have long been a reliable source of low-cost energy, but \ngrowing  demand  and  dwindling  domestic  reserves  mean  that  it  must  find  new  fuels  and \ntechnologies to help meet its future power needs. Thailand\u2019s power consumption has risen by on \naverage 3.6% per year during 2005\u20132016 and demand is expected to double over the period from \n2015 to 2036. To meet its growing energy demand, Thailand has adopted the Alternative Energy \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132036 (AEDP) which sets out targets for renewable energy deployment.1 \nThe plan contains a target of 30% of final energy consumption and 20% of  installed electricity \ngeneration capacity from renewable energy sources by 2036. To meet these targets, biomass will \nbecome the second largest renewable power source after solar, attesting to the immense potential \nof  residual  waste  from  agriculture  in  the  country.  The  AEDP  sets  out  a  target  to  increase  the \ninstalled  generating  capacity  of  biomass  to  5,570  megawatts  (MW)  by  2036  from  its  current \ninstalled capacity of 2,943 MW. \n \n4. \nWTE  plants  that  utilize  biomass  are  prioritized  in  Thailand\u2019s  renewable  energy  policy \nbecause of the additional advantage of supporting farmers and rural communities. Biomass WTE \npromotes rural development by contributing additional income to farmers who sell their agricultural \nwaste as well as small enterprises who engage in waste collection and transportation. Substituting \nfossil  fuels  with  agricultural  waste  for  power  generation  can  also  improve  Thailand\u2019s  energy \nsecurity, save foreign exchange by reducing the need for energy imports, and shield the economy \nfrom  the  impact  of  global  energy  price  fluctuations.  Further,  biomass  is  a  sustainable  form  of \npower  generation  because  it  has  a  carbon-neutral  footprint.  The  biomass  absorbs  the  same \namount of carbon during its cultivation cycle as it releases when consumed as a fuel. Unlike other \nrenewable  energy  technologies  such  as  solar  and  wind,  which  are  intermittent, WTE  can  also \n\n                                                \n1  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2015.

Bangkok. \n\n\f2 \n\noperate on a firm, reliable, and dispatchable basis, providing a more direct substitute for base-\nload generation using fossil fuels. The substitution effectively reduces the grid\u2019s GHG emission \nfactor by displacing generation that otherwise would have been provided using fossil fuels. \n \nThe Ministry of Energy implements its WTE policy for biomass through the small power \n5. \nproducer  (SPP)  and  very  small  power  producer  programs.  The  programs  allow  for  private \ndevelopers  to  build,  own,  and  operate  WTE  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements  (PPAs)  with  Thailand\u2019s  state-owned  power  utility  companies,  the  Electricity \nGenerating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)  and  the  Provincial  Electricity  Authority  of  Thailand. \nRenewable energy projects that utilize biomass are entitled to receive a B0.3 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh)  tariff  incentive  for  7  years  in  addition  to  the  base  wholesale  electricity  tariff.  The  tariff \nincentive is provided to promote investment in WTE technologies. \n \n6. \nThe southern-most provinces of Thailand are some of the poorest in the country. Political \nconflict  and  unrest  in  Southern  Thailand  has  impeded  investment,  employment,  and  overall \ndevelopment and growth. The associated risk of investing in Southern Thailand has also led to \nunderinvestment in the local power system, which continues to experience energy shortages. To \nreduce  risk  and  promote  investment  in  the  power  sector  of  Southern  Thailand,2 WTE  power \nprojects are entitled to receive a special tariff incentive of B1.0 per kWh for 7 years in addition to \nthe B0.3 per kWh tariff. \n \n7. \nWTE power project located in Chana, Songkhla province of Southern Thailand.  \n\nProject design. The project entails the construction and operation of a 25 MW biomass \n\n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\n \n8. \nThe primary source of waste will be rubberwood sourced from local farmers, sawmills, and \nintermediary suppliers located within 150-kilometer (km) radius of the project site. All electricity \nproduced by the project will be purchased by EGAT under a 5-year, automatically renewable PPA \nwith a contracted capacity of 20.6 MW under the SPP program. The project will receive two tariff \nincentives in addition to the base wholesale electricity tariff. The tariff incentives include B0.3 per \nkWh for utilizing biomass and B1.0 per kWh for investing in Southern Thailand, both for a period \nof  7  years  from  commercial  operations,  after  which  time  the  project  will  only  receive  the  base \nwholesale tariff.  \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n9. \nBorrower and sponsor. Chana Green, the borrower, is a project company set up to own, \ndevelop,  construct,  and  operate  the  project.

The longer repayment period of the \nADB loan is necessary to lower the operational debt service leverage over the life of the project. \nReducing the project\u2019s asset\u2013liability mismatch by amortizing the high up-front capital costs over \na  longer  period  improves  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability.  The  limited  availability  of  long-term \nfinancing in Southern Thailand is a market failure due to the macro and political instability in the \nregion. Accessing short-term debt to finance long-term assets results in higher liquidity risk and \nfirm-level  economic  volatility.  This  impacts  the  willingness  of  developers  to  invest  in  long-term \ninfrastructure assets, which ultimately hampers the level and growth of economic activity in the \nregion. \n \nB. \n\nValue-Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s financial assistance will help provide an environmentally sustainable solution to the \n20. \nabundant  agricultural  waste  that  is  produced  from  farming  and  wood  industries  by  converting \nbiomass into a renewable source of electricity. ADB\u2019s assistance helps the long-term economic \nviability  of  the  project, supports the government\u2019s renewable energy  program  and  targets,  and \nvalidates the WTE business model in a DMC. The demonstration effect from ADB\u2019s assistance \nhelps  reduce  the  risk  perception  associated  with WTE  projects  and  creates  awareness  of  the \nbenefits and sustainability of WTE that can be applied to other rural communities and DMCs. \n \nADB\u2019s 18-year financing of a private sector project in Southern Thailand signals long-term \n21. \nconfidence to other banks and developers considering investing in infrastructure assets within the \nregion. Economic development in Southern Thailand has been hindered by underinvestment due \nto political conflict and unrest. Access to financial credit is limited, especially long-term financing \nthat  is  required  for  large  infrastructure  projects.  ADB\u2019s  financing  intervention  goes  beyond  the \nproject and sector to encourage investment more broadly in other types of infrastructure projects \nand industries seeking capital within the Southern Thailand region. \n\n\f6 \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n22. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  the  environment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. An initial environmental examination report was submitted to the Office of the Natural \nResources  and  Environment  Policy  and  Planning  and  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  October \n2017.  The  project  site  and  its  immediate  vicinity  do  not  support  natural  vegetation  of  any \necological significance. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the environmental and social management plan. A series of public \nconsultation  meetings  with  various  stakeholders  were  conducted  from  2016  to  2017  and  the \nconcerns have been addressed by Chana Green. The institutional capacity and commitment of \nChana Green to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate \nand described in the environmental and social management plan. \n \n23. \nThe project with an installed generating capacity of 25 MW will be located in Ku subdistrict, \nChana district, Songkhla province, Southern Thailand. Chana Green, the borrower, acquired 150 \nrais (24 hectares) of private land 2 years ago for the project. Sale deeds have been executed and \npayment  has  been  completed  based  on  negotiated  and  agreed  prices  for  the  acquired \nproperties.10 An upgrade of an existing transmission line (from 33 KV to 115 KV) by the Provincial \nElectricity Authority of Thailand will be required for the project. However, no land acquisition is \nnecessary  as  the  existing  transmission  line  right-of-way  will  be  used.  No  properties  or \nimprovements  will  be  impacted  during  transmission  line  upgrading.  There  are  no  indigenous \npeoples at the project site. \n \nDuring  construction,  an  estimated  300  workers  will  be  engaged,  mainly  as  skilled  and \n24. \nunskilled  laborers.  Chana  Green  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards.11 Chana  Green  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  (and  its \ncontractors\u2019) compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken by the company to safeguard \nthe  project.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB  requirements.  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  no  gender  element, \ngiven  the  limited  potential  for  gender-inclusive  design  of  the  project.  Stakeholders,  including \ncommunities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project,  were  informed  and  consulted  about  the  project.  The \ninitial environmental examination includes a grievance redress mechanism to receive complaints \nand facilitate their resolution. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n25. \nChana  Green  was advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  policy  (1998,  as amended  to date). \nADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes appropriate provisions  prohibiting \n\n                                                \n10 Rai is a unit of area, commonly used in Thailand, and is equal to 1,600 square meters. \n11 ADB. 2003.
