The project will be \ndesigned to reduce disaster risk and improve climate change resilience while creating a cleaner \nenvironment and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Greater  Mal\u00e9  region 2  and  its  neighboring  outer  islands  suffer  from  severe \n3. \nenvironmental  pollution  and  deteriorating  livability  because  of  inadequate  collection  and \nhaphazard  disposal  of  solid  waste.  The  project  area  covers  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  region,  and  32 \ninhabited outer islands and 86 tourist resorts within the Alifu Alifu Atoll, Alifu Dhaalu Atoll, Kaafu \nAtoll, and Vaavu Atoll, with a population of 295,000 (53% of Maldives\u2019 total population).3 The lack \nof a sustainable system to manage the 836 tons per day (tpd) of solid waste generated in the \nproject area (in 2019) results in waste spillage into the ocean, and open dumping and burning of \ngarbage at the 10-hectare (ha) dump site on Thilafushi island established in 1992, which has no \npollution control measures, creating a severe public health and environmental hazard.4 Plumes \nof smoke visible from Mal\u00e9, the international airport, and nearby resorts compromise air quality \nand  pose  a  nuisance  to  residents  and  tourists,  while  leachate  and  plastics  contaminate  the \nsurrounding  marine  environment.  This  poses  a  critical  threat  to  tourism  and  fisheries,  both  of \nwhich  rely  heavily  on  the  country\u2019s  pristine  environment  and  are  cornerstones  to  Maldives\u2019 \neconomy.5 \n \n4. \nExisting  waste  collection,  transfer,  and  disposal.  Waste  Management  Corporation \nLimited is the state-owned operator contracted for collecting waste in Mal\u00e9, while in outer islands \nthis  is  carried  out  by  island  councils.  These  institutions  neither  have  sufficient  capacity  nor \nadequate  equipment  and  infrastructure  for  efficient  collection  and  transfer  of  waste,  such  as \nrefuse bins, trucks, and formal transfer stations. Collected waste is transported to Thilafushi island \n\n \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Maldives, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n2   The Greater Mal\u00e9 region includes Mal\u00e9, Hulhumal\u00e9, Villingili, and the industrial islands: Thilafushi and Gulhi Falhu. \n3  Government  of  Maldives,  National  Bureau  of  Statistics;  and  United  Nations  Population  Fund.  2018.

The remaining quantity is mostly inert \nconstruction and demolition waste. Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure \nServices (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5  Tourism is the largest and most rapidly expanding industry, accounting for 25% of gross domestic product (2018). \nAs of 2014, one-quarter of the country\u2019s employment is in tourism and fisheries. ADB. 2019. Maldives Economic \nUpdate 2019. Manila.  \n\n\fin  open  vessels,  resulting  in  significant  spillage  in  the  ocean.  On  Thilafushi  island,  waste  is \ndumped with no treatment and often burned in the open. Construction and demolition waste, and \nend-of-life vehicles are not collected and processed separately. \n \nNo treatment and disposal infrastructure. There is no infrastructure to systematically \n5. \ntreat  and  dispose the  waste  generated  in  the  project  area.  This  is  a  critical  priority to  improve \npublic health and the environment. Given scarcity of land, there is a need to reduce volume of \nwaste  for  final  disposal.  There  are  only  15  ha  of  land  available  for  solid  waste  treatment  and \ndisposal,  which  the  government  had  to  reclaim  in  2018  from  the  adjacent  lagoon  close  to  the \nThilafushi  island  dump  site  because  of  insufficient  space.  Energy  recovery  from  waste  with \nelectricity  generation  is  an  important  opportunity  given  that  the  country  is  mostly  powered  by \nimported  diesel,  which  has  a  high  production  cost  ($0.30\u2013$0.70  per  kilowatt-hour)  and  high \ngreenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity.6 Therefore, Maldives is vulnerable to oil price \nvariations in the Asia and Pacific region (footnote 6). \n \n6. \nClimate and disaster risks. Maldives is physically vulnerable to climate and disaster risks \ngiven its low elevation of 1.5 meters above sea level. The Indian Ocean tsunami in December \n2004 dispersed about 290,000 cubic meters of waste from open dump sites on land, including \nmunicipal  and  hazardous  waste.7 Natural  hazards  such  as  extreme  rainfall  and  severe  storm \nsurges pose risks to infrastructure and the continuity of service provision. As climate change is \nexpected to exacerbate these hazards, it is necessary to protect systems through disaster- and \nclimate-resilient project designs.8 \n \n7. \nPolicy  framework  and  strategy  for  solid  waste  management.  The  government\u2019s \nStrategic  Action  Plan,  2019\u20132023  recognizes  SWM  as  the  most  visible  and  pressing \nenvironmental issue and details policy actions to promote waste as a valuable resource, including \nthe establishment of regional waste management facilities and WTE.9 The strategic action plan \nalso prioritizes strengthening waste management in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region. The project is fully \naligned  with  the  strategic  action  plan  and  the  National  SWM  Policy  (2015) 10 and  the  Waste \nManagement Regulation (No 2013/R-58), which outline key principles of SWM and environmental \nquality. 11 In  2019,  the  government  established  the  Maldives  Green  Fund  (MGF)  to  enhance \ninvestments in environmental improvement, including SWM.12 A financing plan for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) services, including clear responsibilities, revenue enhancement measures, \nand  fund  flows,  will  need  to  be  established  to  improve  service  sustainability.  In  terms  of \ninstitutional  arrangements,  the  Waste  Management  and  Pollution  Control  Department  of  the \nMinistry of Environment (MOE) is mandated to provide safe waste disposal on all inhabited islands, \n\n \n\n6  ADB.  2014.

The  project  will  focus  on  solid  waste  treatment  and  disposal \ninfrastructure as part of a phased approach to provide a full-fledged SWM service to the project \narea  through  two  ADB  projects.  It  will  complement  the  ongoing  Greater  Mal\u00e9  Environmental \nImprovement and Waste Management Project, approved by ADB in 2018, which is assisting the \ngovernment to (i) improve the upstream segment of the SWM chain, including systemic collection \nand containerized transfer; (ii) implement temporary measures, such as baling of municipal solid \nwaste, as an adequate interim solution to stop open dumping and burning on Thilafushi island \nuntil  a  modern  solid  waste  treatment  and  disposal  facility  is  operational;  (iii)  treat  and  recover \nconstruction and demolition waste; and (iv) strengthen institutional capacity and public awareness \nfor sustainable SWM service delivery.13 ADB and the government agreed on this phased strategy \nto match the implementation and financing capacity of the government, and to improve project \nreadiness  of  the  complex  WTE  infrastructure  (i.e.,  reclaim  15  ha  of  land,  take  advance \nprocurement  actions,  and  conduct  an  environmental \n[EIA])  while \nimplementing urgent measures. Implementation of the Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement \nand Waste Management Project is on track as of 2020 Q1 validation. The collection and transfer \nsystem development and existing dump site improvement (under the ongoing project) are under \nimplementation  and  expected  to  be  completed  by  2023,  1  year  prior  to  the  expected \ncommissioning of the WTE plant. \n \n9. \nPrivate  sector.  The  private sector  is  expected  to  substantially  contribute  to the  project \nthrough  a  design\u2013build\u2013operate  (DBO)  contract,  which  allocates  technical  risk  to  a  private \ncompany and leverages its know-how for efficient design, construction, and O&M of WTE facilities. \nPrivate sector participation will be pivotal to bring the innovative solutions and efficiency required \nto  address  the  complex  challenges  of  providing  SWM  services  in  the  project  area,  including \nlogistic and resource constraints, and to sustain service delivery through a long-term contract. A \nbuild\u2013own\u2013transfer  contract  for  SWM  services  in  the  project  area  was  attempted  in  2011  but \ncanceled in 2014, as the conditions precedent were not met because of various issues, including \ntechnology  selection  and  the  contractor\u2019s  slow  progress.  The  government  prefers  to  retain \nownership and finance the project through public funds, also in view of high perceived financing \nand commercial risks because of the project\u2019s remote location, site constraints, and the low tariff \nfor solid waste treatment services. \n \n10. \nAlignment with ADB priorities. The project is aligned with the operational priorities (OP) \nof ADB Strategy 2030 as it will (i) enhance livability and environmental sustainability, including air \nquality and ocean health in the project area, as well as  mitigate climate change (OPs 3 and 4); \n(ii)  improve  infrastructure  resilience  to  disaster  and  climate  risks  (OP  3);  and  (iii)  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  and  standards  for  service  delivery,  and  improve  public  awareness  on \nsustainable waste management, targeting women (OPs 2, 4 and 6).14 The project is also in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies, as it will reduce \n\n \n\n13 ADB. 2018.

Lessons from implementation of previous projects in Maldives are incorporated \nin  the  project  design.  These  are:  (i)  include  long-term  O&M  in  contracts  to  improve  service \ncontinuity  and  sustainability;  (ii)  provide  adequate  preparation  support  to  avoid  downstream \ndelays; 16  (iii)  provide  capacity  support  to  project  management  unit  (PMU)  staff  in  project \nimplementation,  particularly  in  procurement,  contract  management,  and  safeguards; 17  (iv) \ncomplement infrastructure investments with strong capacity building for O&M; (v) promote strong \ncommunity consultation and awareness on 3R, targeting women;18 and (vi) incorporate disaster \nrisk reduction and climate change-resilient measures into project designs.  \n \nProject  relevance  amid  coronavirus  disease.  The  project  remains  highly  relevant  in \n12. \ntimes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic crisis considering its importance in limiting \nthe  spread  of  infectious  diseases  through  the  provision  of  sanitary  treatment  of  solid  waste, \nincluding medical waste. The project\u2019s positive impact on the environment and ocean health will \ncontribute to the medium-term recovery of the tourism industry, which has been badly affected by \nthe pandemic. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: waste as a valuable resource for income \ngeneration  promoted  (footnote  9).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  solid  waste \ntreatment and disposal services improved in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region and its outer islands.19  \n \n14. \nOutput  1:  Disaster-  and  climate-resilient  regional  waste  management  facility \ndeveloped.  This  will  include  (i)  a  500  tpd  WTE  plant  with  15  years  of  O&M,  including  two \ntreatment lines of 250 tpd each, a minimum 8-megawatt (MW) electricity surplus energy recovery \nfacility, and an air pollution control system; and (ii) a landfill for safe disposal of hazardous air \npollution control residues and non-marketable bottom ashes.20 The facility (WTE plant and landfill) \nwill be implemented through a DBO contract to a specialized firm, which will integrate a design\u2013\nbuild phase and a 15-year operation (O&M) phase to improve sustainability of service delivery. \nThe facility will be able to accommodate a third 250 tpd treatment line in the future, which will be \nrequired to respond to further demand increase. The incineration with electricity generation (WTE) \ntechnology minimizes land requirements and produces renewable energy, addressing the critical \nland and electricity constraints in Maldives. Recycling of marketable incineration bottom ash and \nmetals will be promoted to further reduce landfill requirements and provide valuable materials for \nthe  construction  and  recycling  industry.  All  facilities  will  adopt  disaster-  and  climate-resilient \nfeatures,  such  as  raised  floor  elevations,  flood-proof  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  and \nlandfill cells, and enhanced drainage systems (footnote 8). \n \n15. \nOutput 2: Institutional capacity in sustainable waste-to-energy service delivery and \nenvironmental  monitoring,  and  public  awareness  on  waste-to-energy  and  reduce-reuse-\n\n \n\n15  ADB. 2019.

This will include (i) preparing and implementing a capacity development plan \nto  improve  the  capacity  of  MOE  and  EPA  to  supervise  sustainable  WTE  service  delivery;  (ii) \nstrengthening MOE and EPA staff capacity in supervising WTE operations, including monitoring \nWTE operational performance and environmental standards, and managing performance-based \nDBO  contract;  (iii)  supporting  enhanced  financial  sustainability  for  WTE  O&M  through \nimplementation  of  an  agreed  O&M  financing  plan,  including  financial  need  forecasting  and \nfinalization  of  financing  sources,  a  revenue  enhancement  plan,  assignment  of  responsibilities, \nand  fund  flow  arrangements  for  payment  of  O&M;  and  (iv)  conducting  public  awareness \ncampaigns on WTE and 3R benefits. The project will develop PMU and government capacity to \nprepare,  monitor,  and  manage  sustainable  WTE  through  consulting  services  for  contract \nmanagement, monitoring, supervision, and institutional development. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe  project  complements  the  ongoing  Greater  Mal\u00e9  Environmental  Improvement  and \nWaste Management Project and assists the government to provide a full-fledged SWM service to \nthe project area through proven high-level waste treatment and disposal infrastructure, suitable \nfor a small island country context and with positive benefits for ocean health. ADB took the leading \nrole to mobilize the co-financing from AIIB and JFJCM to fully finance the project and maximize \nits development impact. The project is synergistic with other development partners\u2019 initiatives in \nthe country that are supporting sustainable SWM in other areas of Maldives and strengthening \nSWM legislation (footnote 11). ADB is closely coordinating with the Islamic Development Bank, \nwhich  is  processing  a  loan  with  an  indicative  amount  of  $20.00  million  for  rehabilitating  the \nThilafushi  island  dump  site  (adjacent  to  the  project  site)  and  developing  a  transfer  station  in \nHulhumal\u00e9. \n \n17. \nADB  contributed  to  formulating  critical  components  to  project  design,  including  (i) \nsustainable SWM strategies and solutions suitable for reducing ocean pollution in a small island \ncontext;  (ii)  adoption  of  the  DBO  modality  to  tap  private  sector  know-how  for  efficient  and \ninnovative  solutions,  allocate  risk  properly,  and  ensure  sustainability  of service  provision  given \nthe low capacity of the government to operate a complex WTE facility; (iii) incorporation of proven \nhigh-level  technology  and  operational  standards  into  the  WTE  DBO  contract  to  ensure  quality \ninfrastructure, 21 value  for  money,  and  high  technical  and  environmental  performance  during \noperations; (iv)  strategic  procurement  initiatives, such  as market  sounding to  understand  WTE \nmarkets and ensure good competition in a small island country context; (v) capacity support for \nprocurement, contract management, safeguards, and O&M to procure and manage complex WTE \nDBO  contracts;  (vi)  development  of  an  O&M  financing  plan  to  establish  a  clear  fund  flow \narrangement  and  financing  strategy  for  sustainable  O&M;  (vii)  key  designs  to  improve  project \nresilience to climate and disaster risks (footnote 8); and (viii) community consultation and public \nawareness  on  WTE  and  3R.  With  the  support  of  ADB\u2019s  High-Level  Technology  Fund,  ADB  (i) \nfacilitated a knowledge exchange program with the Clean Authority of Tokyo for the Government \nof Maldives to learn how to adopt proven high-level technologies and service standards, and (ii) \nsupported the preparation of a draft regulatory framework and standards for WTE in Maldives. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $151.13  million  (Table  1).

The AIIB \nloan\u2019s  terms  and  conditions  will  be  described  in  a  loan  agreement  between  AIIB  and  the \ngovernment.  The  JFJCM  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $10.00  million,  to  be \nadministered by ADB. \n \n20. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures related to (i) \nthe WTE DBO package (for the design and build phases only); (ii) consulting services for project \nmanagement design and construction supervision, capacity building, and public awareness; (iii) \nincremental  recurrent  costs;  and  (iv)  contingencies.  The  AIIB  loan  will  finance  expenditures \nrelated to the WTE DBO package (for the design and build phases only) and contingencies. The \nJFJCM  will  finance  expenditures  related  to  the  WTE  DBO  package  (for  the  design  and  build \nphases  only),  contingencies,  and  consulting  services  for  the  certification  of  greenhouse  gases \nemission reduction from the WTE plant. ADB will fully administer the JFJCM grant and will partially \nadminister the AIIB loan for environmental and social services, financial management services, \ninvestigative  services,  disbursement  services,  and  procurement  services.  The  government  will \ncontribute $27.74 million to the investment costs of the project to finance (i) taxes and duties; (ii) \na  portion  of  the  costs  related  to  works,  equipment,  consulting  services,  incremental  recurrent \ncosts, and contingencies; and (iii) financing charges.

Technical  aspects  of  the  project  were  appraised  based  on  (i)  rationale  and \nrelevance, benefits, proposed designs, ease, and sustainability of implementation and operations; \n(ii) technical alternatives and their viability (the MOE evaluated a range of treatment technologies \nto choose the best practicable environmental option and promote service continuity); (iii) the life \ncycle costs (including capital and operating costs) and achievable cost savings (including climate- \nand disaster-resilient measures); (iv) minimization of adverse environmental and social impacts; \nand (v) optimization of timelines for implementation through high project readiness. The project \ndesign  is  robust  and  adequately  addresses the key  solid  waste treatment  and  disposal  issues \nfacing  the  project  area,  positively  impacting  ocean  health.  The  project  design,  including  cost \nestimates  and the  implementation  schedule,  accommodates  possible  delays  or  cost  increases \nbecause of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains. \n\n24 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  feasibility  of \ninterventions  proposed  under  the  project.  The  economic  analysis  shows  the  project  to  be \neconomically viable, with a calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.8%, which \nexceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. The economic viability of this project will \nincrease further if unquantifiable benefits, such as environmental improvements, are included in \nthe  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  EIRR is  higher  than the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  for  all \nadverse sensitivity scenarios considered for the analysis, including a worst-case scenario where \nthere is no overhead connection to Gulhi Falhu island (for full electricity utilization), and the grid \nenergy demand on Thilafushi island remains 2 MW in 2025 (an EIRR of 10.8%), which is very \nconservative.25 Construction of the WTE plant along with strengthening of institutional capacity \nand community awareness on sustainable waste management will benefit about 350,000 people \nfrom 2026. The estimated poverty impact ratio is 32.6%.26 \n \n26. \nFinancial  analysis.  Financial  analysis  of  the  project  was  conducted  as  per  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.27 The  project  is  expected  to  substantially  cover  (96%)  O&M  costs through  different \nrevenue sources (sales of electricity, metals, and bottom ash, and tipping fee from resort waste). \nThe government is committed to cover any shortfalls in O&M costs. The WTE plant will have four \ndifferent sources of revenue: (i) proceeds from sales of electricity,28 (ii) proceeds from sales of \nmetals, (iii) proceeds from sales of incineration bottom ash, and (iv) tipping fees from resort waste \ndelivered to Thilafushi island. The government-owned State Electric Company Limited plans to \npurchase electricity, and the construction and recycling industries are potential markets for bottom \nash and metals. Estimated annual revenue from the sale of different by-products from the WTE \nplant  and  tipping  fees  from  resort  waste  will  cover  a  substantial  part  of  the  annual  O&M \nrequirements under the DBO contract (96% per annum on average). In the worst-case scenario \n(para. 25), the O&M cost recovery will decrease to 43% per annum on average. Potential budget \nshortfalls to pay any O&M gap pose a substantial financial sustainability risk. To address this risk, \nthe government (i) will cover any O&M shortfall either through funds from the MGF (footnote 12) \nor other budgetary allocations; and (ii) has agreed to an O&M financing plan (para. 15), which will \nbe finalized 1 year before commencement of O&M with support from the project. In the medium \nto long term, the MOE is also committed to moving toward a full O&M cost recovery and polluters-\npay approach, and is planning to collect a tipping (treatment) fee for waste delivered to the WTE \nfacility, which is currently not in place (except for resorts delivering waste to Thilafushi island). \nAlthough  a  revenue  deficit  was  recorded  each  year  from  2014  to  2019,  the  Government  of \nMaldives is taking adequate steps to reduce the deficit through fiscal regulatory measures. Also, \nthe increasing budget allocation to environmental protection, the introduction of a green tax, and \nthe establishment of the MGF, which all occurred during 2014\u20132019, underline the government\u2019s \ncommitment to the sustainability of SWM projects. \n \n \n\n \n\n25 An overhead connection to Gulhi Falhu island (the nearest island, at a distance 300 meters) is planned to fully utilize \nenergy from the WTE plant as the base case. Current grid demand on Thilafushi island is 2 MW, but total power \ndemand  on  the  island  is  more  than  4  MW,  as  most  industries  have  private  diesel  generators.  Grid  demand  on \nThilafushi island is expected to grow considerably with expansion of the power grid and planned developments on \nthe island. Government of Maldives, MOE. 2020.

Manila. \n\n28 The government will confirm through a memorandum of understanding between the MOF, MOE, and State Electric \nCompany Limited that all surplus electricity from the WTE plant will be sold at a minimum price of $0.10 per kilowatt-\nhour in line with current market prices (conservative assumption). \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nC. \n \n27. \nSolid  waste  treatment  and  disposal  services  established  under  the  project  will  be \nmaintained  through  a  long-term  O&M  phase  under  the  DBO  contract  with  a  specialized  WTE \noperator,  which  will  also  design  and  build  the  facilities.  The  contract  has  12  measurable \noperational  performance  guarantees,  including  service  quality,  efficiency,  environmental \nstandards, and damages, as effective leverage mechanisms for compliance. The MOE and EPA \nwill supervise O&M performance, as they are the most suitable institutions with technical skills \nand experience in SWM projects and environmental monitoring. The MOE will take over the WTE \nplant after the 15-year O&M period. The project will also strengthen the monitoring and contract \nmanagement capacity of the MOE and EPA, which is necessary because of the complexity of the \nWTE plant and its operations. Economic and financial sustainability will be ensured through the \nsale of electricity, metals, and bottom ash from the WTE plant; collection of a resort waste tipping \nfee;  and  government\u2019s  transfers  to  cover  any  O&M  shortfall  and  plan  to  enhance  O&M  cost \nrecovery  over  the  medium  to  long  term  (para.  26).  If  there  is  any  indication  that  full  energy \nutilization  is  unlikely  at  the  time  of WTE facility commissioning,  other  options to  utilize  energy, \nincluding  desalination  and  hydrogen  production,  will  be  further  explored  to  improve  project \nbenefits and sustainability. Effective SWM treatment services established under the project will \nminimize pollution and decrease the use of natural resources, thereby improving the environment, \nespecially ocean health, with substantial spillovers to the tourism and fishery sectors that will help \ntheir recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic (footnote 5). \n \nD. \n \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in \n28. \naccordance with ADB guidelines (footnote 27). The FMA considered the financial management \ncapacity  of the MOE  and  its  PMU,  and  covered the  areas  of fund  flow  arrangements,  staffing, \nbudgeting,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  control  procedures,  financial \ninformation systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The FMA found that the \nMOE  and  its  PMU  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity  to  (i)  record  the  required \nfinancial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and audit reports in a timely \nmanner,  and  (iii)  safeguard  the  financial  assets.  The  PMU  is  implementing  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9 \nEnvironmental  Improvement  and  Waste  Management  Project,  and  the  first  audit  report  was \nunqualified and submitted on time. However, the FMA identified the following risks: (i) insufficient \nstaff in the PMU accounts section to handle multiple projects simultaneously, (ii) PMU accounts \nsection staff lacks training in ADB procedures and systems, (iii) complex financing structure with \nseveral  financiers,  (iv)  absence  of  an  effective  internal  audit  function,  (v)  insufficient  interim \nfinancial  analysis  and  reporting,  and  (vi)  project  transactions  are  not  recorded  using  proper \naccounting software. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. \n \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  an  agreed  action  plan  involving  (i)  appointing \n29. \nadditional  financial  staff  or  an  account  officer  to  support  the  PMU  in  handling  the  additional \nworkload during the period when implementation of the Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement \nand  Waste  Management  Project,  and  implementation  of  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  Waste-to-Energy \nfinancial  management  requirements, \nProject  overlap;  (ii)  providing \ndisbursement procedures, and systems; (iii) including comprehensive financial information in the \nquarterly  project  progress  reports; (iv)  strengthening  the MOE\u2019s  internal  audit function;  and (v) \nprocuring  accounting  software  for  the  PMU  to  use.  The  MOE  will  maintain  separate  books  of \naccounts for the project following the International Public Sector Accounting Standards under the \ncash  basis  of  accounting,  and  the  project  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  the \nAuditor General\u2019s Office in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. \n \n\ntraining  on  ADB\u2019s \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nProcurement. Procurement of civil works and goods, including the DBO contract scope \n30. \nand consulting services, will be undertaken in conformity with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall \nprocurement risk for the project is moderate. The MOF and MOE have extensive experience in \nprocurement of works under ADB-financed projects and those of other development partners. \n \n31. \nA DBO contract for the WTE plant, including 15 years of O&M service, was selected as \noffering the best fit for the project\u2019s objectives. The MOE, supported by ADB, conducted a market \nengagement to assess interest, and the feedback was incorporated into the bidding document, \nincreasing  the  probability  of  optimal  competition.  The  evaluation  criteria  adopted  assesses  life \ncycle  costs  of  the  WTE  plant,  including  the  guaranteed  energy  generation,  and  the  contract \nconditions  include  various  environmental  performance  guarantees.  The  strategic  integration  of \nthese key aspects contributes to achieving value for money. \n \n32. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government (and the MOF and MOE). The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). Based on \nthe risk assessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in the project design aim to \n(i) establish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of relevant information; (ii) develop and \nupdate  a  website  to  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and \nsafeguards; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to provide effective resolutions to \ngrievances, if any. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nIn 2016, poverty in Maldives was estimated at 8.2%, with poverty levels in the project area \nof 1.7% in Mal\u00e9 city and Vaavu Atoll; 8.0% in Alifu Dhaalu Atoll; 15.7% in Kaafu Atoll; and 16.5% \nin  Alifu  Alifu  Atoll. 29 The  project  includes  improved  waste  management  benefiting  poor  outer \nisland communities. The project will result in a cleaner environment, positively impacting fishing \nand tourism-based livelihoods, on which many of the poor depend. \n \n34. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) include indicators related to the training of eligible staff and \nthe generation of public awareness with some gender elements. In addition, the project design \nwill ensure the provision of male, female, and all-gender and barrier-free toilets at the WTE plant \nand  other  project  facilities,  and  this  will  be  a  contractual  requirement  in  the  DBO  contract.  No \nseparate gender action plan has been prepared. \n \nF. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n36. \nEnvironment (category A). The draft EIA, including an environmental management plan \n(EMP), was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 24 December 2019. The construction and operation \nof a large WTE facility has potential significant adverse impacts that may affect an area larger \nthan the sites or facilities subject to physical works. The findings of the EIA are as follows: (i) the \nproject will result in significant environmental benefits because open dumping and burning of solid \nwaste  will  be  stopped  in  the  project  area;  (ii)  during  construction,  the  project  will  not  have \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n29 The national poverty line is Rf74 per day.

Safeguard Categories. \n\n\fsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable \nthrough the effective implementation of the EMP; (iii) during operations, potential impacts are on \nambient  air  quality,  marine  water  quality,  noise,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and \nsafety.  However,  with  the  performance  guarantees  embedded  in  the  DBO  contract,  significant \nimpacts can be avoided, and residual impacts can be mitigated by measures specified in the EMP; \nand (iv) the project will have no social impacts pertaining to land loss, land fragmentation, physical \ndisplacement,  loss  of  income,  loss  of  productive  land,  potential  income  loss  for  fishers,  and \nprevention of fishing-related activities and fishing routes.31 \n \n37. \nThe  MOE  conducted  public  consultations  from  2017  to  2019  with  local  communities, \ngovernment authorities, and nongovernment organizations (ADB participated as observer to two \nconsultations);  their  feedback  was  considered  during  project  design. 32  The  EPA  provided \nenvironmental  clearance  in  January  2020  adopting  the  conditions  described  in  the  EIA.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism was established for the Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement \nand Waste Management Project and the PMU notified the public that the same mechanism will \nbe used for the project. The project will ensure that members of the grievance redress committee, \nthe PMU, and the contractor will be provided with trainings to address project-related grievances. \nThe PMU has a dedicated environment officer and will receive capacity support from consultants \nto ensure sufficient monitoring and management of environmental impacts. The EMP will be part \nof the DBO contract for WTE, giving contractor responsibility and resources for implementation, \nunder the oversight of the PMU. The PMU will retain external environmental experts to monitor \nthe implementation of the project\u2019s EMP and compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand conditions of the environmental clearance.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The MOE prepared a draft due diligence report, \n38. \nwhich found no permanent or temporary resettlement impacts resulting from the project, as all \nworks are proposed within the available government land reclaimed on Thilafushi island. A field \nvisit to the project site and stakeholder consultations confirmed the findings reported in the draft \ndue diligence report.33 \n \n39. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. Project due diligence confirmed that there are no indigenous peoples present \nat or around the project site. \n \nG. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n40. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail  in  the risk  assessment  and risk management  plan.34 The  FMA  in the  PAM (footnote  22) \noutlines other detailed risks and mitigation measures related to financial management. \n \n\nRisks \nLogistics, sourcing challenges, and price \nsurges of materials beyond projections \ndue to remote context and COVID-19 \npandemic result in cost overruns and \ndelays in project completion. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nA longer implementation period will accommodate possible project \ndelays, including those caused by COVID-19 pandemic and its \nimpacts on global supply chains.

Incineration bottom ashes are either recycled \n\nand sold to the construction or recycling industry, or disposed to landfill. \n\nd   In the first year of operation, annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction (tCO2-eq/year) is estimated to be 28,000 \ntCO2-eq/year due start up period of the plant. Greenhouse gas emission offset by the WTE plant will increase over \nthe years of operations and estimated to amount to 40,000 tCO2-eq/year on average over 20 years of operations. \ne  According  to  European  Union  renewable  energy  directive  (2009/28/EC), the biodegradable  fraction of municipal \nand industrial waste is considered biomass, and is thus a renewable energy source. On the average, the energy \noutput from WTE plants is about 50% renewable. \n\nf   Includes  two  treatment  lines  of  250  tons-per-day  each,  a  minimum  8-megawatt  (MW)  electricity  surplus  energy \n\nrecovery facility, and an air pollution control system  \n\ng   Implemented through a DBO contract, which will include a design and build phase, and a 15-year O&M phase. ADB \nwill  finance  the  design  and build phase. The  government  will  finance  the  full cost  of  the O&M  phase.  The  DBO \ncontract includes the waste-to-energy plant (1a) and landfill for disposal of WTE APC residues and non-marketable \nbottom ashes (1b).  \n\nh   These include: (i) elevating base floor to 2.2 m of critical structures and facilities, (ii) enhancing capacity of drainage \nsystems;  (iii)  enhancing  stability  and  impermeability  of  landfill  berms;  (iv)  flood-proofing  critical  mechanical  and \nelectrical systems and establishing redundancy; (v) protecting stormwater throughout pumps and backflow inverters; \n(vi)  protecting  key  civil  structures  against  buoyancy;  and  (vii)  strengthening  critical  and  elevated  structures  to \nwithstand Category 2 cyclone and  intensity V Modified Mercalli Intensity earthquake scale. \n\ni    To be supported under attached TA. \nContribution to the ADB Results Framework: \nRFI 3.1: Total annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction (tons of CO2 equivalent per tCO2-eq/year).
