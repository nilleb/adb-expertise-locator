Through  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  the \npower  distribution  network throughout the country,  the  investment  program  will  improve power \nsupply  reliability  and  efficiency,  and  support  the  improvement  of  operational  and  financial \nperformance of the state-owned power distribution company.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nSector overview. The energy sector plays a leading role in Azerbaijan\u2019s socioeconomic \ngrowth.  The  total  electricity  production  in  2014  reached  22.7  billion  kilowatt-hours  (kWh),  of \nwhich  94%  was  generated  from  thermal  power  and  6%  from  hydropower.  The  current  total \ninstalled  generation  capacity  is  6.2  gigawatts  (GW)  including  gas-fired  thermal  power  plant \ncapacity  of  5.1  GW  (82.3%)  and  hydropower  plant  capacity  of  1.1  GW  (17.7%).  In  2014,  the \navailable total generation capacity was 5.9 GW while the peak demand was 4.1 GW. At present, \nelectricity production is sufficient to cover domestic demand, with the surplus being exported to \nneighboring countries, taking advantage of regional synergies.3 Though the economic growth is \ncurrently  experiencing  slowdown,  the  recovery  is  projected  to  strengthen  in 2018  and  beyond. \nDomestic electricity sales are expected to grow due to economy recovery and improved power \nsupply reliability.  \n \n4. \nThe key challenges facing the  energy sector are (i) improving  operational and financial \nefficiency, (ii) restoring and maintaining high levels of services throughout the country, and (iii) \nestablishing  a  sustainable  cost-recovery  financing  mechanism.  Despite  significant  investments \nmade  in  generation  and  transmission  facilities  since  2005,  supply  of  reliable  electricity  to \ncustomers is limited as a result of bottlenecks in the distribution network, where relatively little \ninvestment  has  been  made  because  of  budget  constraints. 4  In  2014,  the  technical  and \ncommercial distribution losses were 18.8%5 and revenue collection was 70.0%.6 Although there \nis  almost  100%  access  to  energy,  the  existing  distribution  networks  outside  of  Baku  and  its \nsuburban  areas,  particularly  in  secondary  cities  and  rural  areas,  are  in  poor  condition  and \ncannot provide reliable, high-quality services to customers, which affects the living conditions of \nhouseholds  and  discourages  new  economic  activities.  The  majority  of  power  distribution \nfacilities have been in operation for 30 years or more. The equipment has reached the end of its \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Preparing the MFF Power Distribution Enhancement Investment \n\nProgram. Manila. \n\n3   In 2014, power export accounted for 2% of the total production.  \n4   Currently,  all  investment  in  distribution  networks  relies  on  the  state  budget  with  no  private  sector  investments \n\nparticipated in the distribution subsector due to slow progress on sector reform. \n\n5   Refers to the aggregate level for the distribution network outside of Baku and its suburban area, including technical \nloss  of  11.13%  and  commercial  loss  of  7.73%.  In  Baku  and  its  suburban  area,  the  technical  loss  is  8.97%  and \ncommercial loss is 0.74%. Commercial losses include electricity theft and inaccurate metering.  \n\n6   The revenue not collected amounts to about $200 million. \n\n\fservice life and has become undependable, with more frequent outages and increasing losses. \nThe  unreliable  power  supply  and  inefficient  utilization  of  resources  undermine  industrial \ncompetitiveness and constrain economic growth. The government aims to decrease urban\u2013rural \nincome  disparity  and  diversify  from  hydrocarbon-export  industries  by  increased  economic \nactivity,  which  requires  reliable  electricity.  Rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  distribution \nnetwork is now considered the priority for future energy sector investments.  \n \n5. \nThe government owns and manages the energy sector in Azerbaijan, and is committed \nto sector reform with the aim of improving system efficiency, supply reliability, and transparency. \nAs the first reform step, all power distribution assets and functions were entirely separated from \nthe  state-owned  company\u2014Azerenerji  OJSC 7 \u2014and  transferred  to  another  state-owned \ncompany\u2014Azerishiq OJSC8 (formerly Bakielektrikshebeke OJSC, i.e., Baku Electric Company). \nThrough  unbundling,  the  government  will  improve  the  sector  operation  efficiency  and \ntransparency  by  separating  cost  centers  into  different  networks,  supporting  commercialization, \nand  holding  each  company  accountable  for  its  performance.  Further  unbundling  of  the \ngeneration  and  transmission  assets  is  under  consideration  by  the  government.  Through  the \nimplementation of the Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program, the efficiency and \ntransparency of the distribution network is expected to substantially improve, which will support \nfurther sector reform especially unbundling. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)  is supporting \nthe  government\u2019s  reform  efforts  through  a  technical  assistance  for  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  power  sector. 9 A  road  map  for  private  sector  participation  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nenergy sector has been drafted and is expected to be finalized in 2016. \n \n6. \nThe distribution system in Baku, the capital city, has received significant investment from \nthe  state  budget,  creating  a  modern  and  technically  efficient  system.  Concurrent  with  the \ntechnical  improvements,  Azerishiq  OJSC  instigated  a  rigorous  loss  reduction  and  collection \nimprovement  program  in  Baku,  installing  modern  metering,  operating  a  modern  tamper-proof \nbilling system, and ensuring all customers paid on time. As a result of this program, distribution \nlosses  have  been  reduced  to  levels  similar  to  those  in  many  European  countries.  Azerishiq \nOJSC intends to replicate the successful experience in Baku in the rest of the country by 2020.  \n \n7. \nAt  present,  the  energy  sector  is facing a funding shortage  with tariffs  that  do  not  cover \ncapital costs. The retail electricity tariff for 2014 was AZN0.06/kWh (including value-added tax). \nThe tariff is adequate to operate the existing network but insufficient to rehabilitate and augment \nthe  network.  Financial  and  tariff  reform  will  be  required  to  meet  Azerishiq  OJSC\u2019s  future \ninvestment requirements.  \n \n8. \nSector road map. The government has made a strong commitment to provide adequate \nand  reliable  electricity  supply  to  all  consumers  by  2020,  as  reflected  in the  country\u2019s  medium-\nterm  development  framework  Azerbaijan  2020:  Look  into  the  Future.10 The  inclusive  growth \n                                                \n7   Before February 2015, OJSC Azerenerji was a vertically integrated and 100% state-owned enterprise in charge of \nelectricity generation, transmission, and distribution except for distribution in Baku and Nakhchivan. Azerenerji has \nestablished  separate  business  units  to  manage  the  transmission  and  generation  assets  accordingly,  and \nimprovement in its governance and operation efficiency is ongoing. \n\n8   Azerishiq  OJSC  is  a  100%  state-owned  enterprise  responsible  for  electricity  distribution,  supply,  and  other \ncustomer  services  (connection,  metering,  and  billing)  in  Azerbaijan,  except  the  functions  in  Nakhchivan \nAutonomous  Republic,  which  is  directly  administered  by  the  state  energy  agency  of  Nakhchivan  Autonomous \nRepublic.  The  national  distribution  networks  administrated  by  Azerishiq  comprise  seven  regional  networks,  i.e., \nAran, Baku, Canub, Garb, Markazi Aran, Shimal, and Shimal Garb. \n\n9    ADB.  2014.

The government undertakes to \nachieving full cost recovery for Azerishiq OJSC by 2022, by pursuing financial and tariff reform \nand  gradually  adjusting  the  tariff  level  and  structure,  taking  into  account  cost  reduction, \nefficiency  improvement,  and  targeted  financial  support  from  the  government  to  protect \nvulnerable  customers  groups.  ADB  will  support  the  government  to  develop  and  implement  an \nenergy sector financial recovery plan.12 \n \n10. \nStrategic  context.  The  proposed  investment  program  is  closely  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for \nAzerbaijan.13 ADB is committed to supporting improved energy efficiency and operation so as to \nprovide  adequate  and  reliable  energy  supply  throughout  the  country.  This  can  then  stimulate \nnew, non-oil economic activities, promote inclusive growth, and reduce urban\u2013rural disparities. \nThe investment program contributes to achieving ADB\u2019s Energy Policy objectives of promoting \nenergy efficiency, access to energy for all, and capacity building and governance.14  \n \n11.  Major lessons from previous ADB interventions in the energy sector are incorporated in \nthe program design, which include the need for (i) continuous dialogue with the government on \ntariff  issues  to  promote  energy  sector  reform,  (ii)  capacity  building  for  power  utilities,  and  (iii) \ngood  governance  and  commercialization.  ADB  provided  Azerenerji  OJSC  with  a  loan  of  $160 \nmillion  to  finance  power  transmission  improvement. 15 The  ongoing  interventions  include \ntechnical  assistance  for  preparing  a  pilot  renewable  energy  project  (biomass  cogeneration)16 \nand  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (footnote  9).  The  proposed  investment  program \ncomplements  ongoing  assistance in facilitating low-carbon development and climate resilience \nthrough improved energy efficiency. \n \n12. \nPolicy  framework.  The  overall  vision  of  the  government\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  is  to \nutilize domestic energy resources  efficiently,  protect the  country\u2019s  energy  security,  and ensure \nthe delivery of reliable and adequate energy services throughout the country. The energy sector \npolicy framework17 features (i) promoting efficient use of energy resources and increasing sector \noperation efficiency, (ii) establishing a sound regulatory environment to promote competition, (iii) \n\n                                                \n11  Government of Azerbaijan. 2015.

The State Program for Development \nof Fuel and Energy Sector in Azerbaijan for 2016\u20132025 is under preparation. The government has confirmed that \nthe  sector  policy  contained  within  the  existing  state  program  for  2005\u20132015,  and  the key  priority  areas  identified \ntherein, will be incorporated in the state program for the next planning period and continue to be implemented. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fimproving  the  sector  structure  to  attract  more  investments,  (iv)  promoting  sustainable \ndevelopment  to  ensure  environmental  protection,  (v)  strengthening  financial  discipline  in  the \nsector  and  ensuring  full  payment  for  energy  consumption,  and  (vi)  increasing  the  share  of \nrenewable energy in power generation. \n \n13. \nTo  achieve  the  vision  of  long-term  development,  the  following  main  goals  have  been \nidentified: (i) ensuring that power needs are fully met, (ii) facilitating gradual revision of tariffs to \nachieve full cost recovery, (iii) improving the efficiency of operations and promoting financial and \noperational transparency, (iv) promoting energy efficiency and alternative energy technologies, \nand (v) encouraging private sector participation. \n \n14. \nInvestment program. An energy sector master plan has been prepared with a technical \nassistance  from  ADB 18  and  other  development  partners.  The  master  plan  sets  out  an \ninvestment  strategy  for  the  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  subsectors19 and \nforms  the  basis  of  the  Azerishiq  Investment  Plan  (2015\u20132025).  The  plan  envisages  the  total \ninvestment for distribution network improvement in 2015\u20132025 at about $4.6 billion.20 The ADB-\nsupported  investment  program  of  $1.0  billion  represents  approximately  22%  of  the  overall \nrequirement  and  selects  priority  investment  components.  The  investment  program  will  be \nundertaken  in  sequence  and  cover  all  distribution  networks  in  seven  regions:  Aran,  Baku, \nCanub, Garb, Markazi Aran, Shimal, and Shimal Garb. The immediate priority for investment in \nthe  distribution  network  is  to  rehabilitate  the  distribution  networks  that  currently  experience \nfrequent system outages and supply interruptions to customers.  \n \n15.  Multitranche  financing  facility.  The  MFF  will  allow  ADB  to  establish  a  stronger  long-\nterm  partnership  with  the  government  meeting  its  development  goals,  support  energy  sector \nreform, improve energy policies, and strengthen governance and capacities.   Rehabilitation and \nenhancement of the distribution network will require substantial capital, which cannot be taken \non  by  the  government  at  once.  The  MFF  enables  ADB  to  finance  the  investment  programs \nsequentially  matching  Azerishiq\u2019s  implementation  capacity.  The  MFF  modality  supports  high \nproject  readiness  and  timely  implementation,  such  as  support  for  project  design,  advance \nprocurement, and safeguard due diligence being conducted upfront.  \n \nThe  proposed  investment  program  has  the  following  key  benefits:  (i)  support  to  the \n16. \ngovernment in achieving its strategic development targets, (ii) introduction of modern technology \nand  improvements  in  energy  efficiency,  (iii)  support  to  Azerishiq  OJSC  to  improve  corporate \ngovernance and transparency, (iv) knowledge and skills transfer via the training of power utility \nstaff to international standards in the implementation of the latest technology, and (v) improving  \nelectricity  supply  service  quality  and  enhancing  productivity  of  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.  The  investment  program  will  benefit  1.45  million  customers,  of  which  60%  are \nresidential customers. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  increased  availability  of  reliable  electricity \nsupply to all domestic consumers. The outcome will be improved efficiency and reliability of the \npower distribution networks. \n                                                \n18  ADB. 2014.

The \nTranche  1  and  subsequent  tranches  will  have  similar  components  but  only  with  regard  to \ndifferent  districts  under  each  regional  network,  which  are  selected  based  on  the  priority  and \nimplementation capacity of Azerishiq OJSC.   \n\nRehabilitation  of  distribution  networks.  This  involves  rehabilitation  and \naugmentation  of  aging  medium-  and  low-voltage  distribution  networks  including \n6\u2013110 kilovolt (kV) substations and distribution lines. \nRehabilitation of customer service lines and installation of smart meters.21 \nThis includes replacement of 0.4 kV customer service lines including installation \nof  smart  meters.  The  existing  0.4  kV  bare  overhead  conductors  will  be \ncompletely  replaced  with  new  self-supporting  aerial  bundled  cables,  and  the \nexisting poles will be replaced. The new cables will prevent energy theft. \nSupport for institutional strengthening. This includes (a) capacity building and \ntraining for financial management, accounting and auditing, project management, \nprocurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards; (b) a public information campaign for energy efficiency improvement \nand tariff reform; and (c) improvement of operation and maintenance facilities in \nthe Azerishiq OJSC regional distribution networks. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans   \n\nD. \n \nThe investment program is estimated to cost $1.0 billion (Table 1). Azerishiq OJSC has \n19. \nrequested ADB to provide an MFF of up to $750 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance part of the investment program. The MFF is expected to comprise three tranches, \nsubject to Azerishiq OJSC\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the \nrelated  legal  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and \nundertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  first  tranche  loan  will  be \nfinanced from ordinary capital resources and guaranteed by Azerbaijan. The loan will have a 25-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  with  custom-tailored  repayment;  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program  \n($ million) \n\nBase Costb \nRehabilitation of distribution networks \nRehabilitation of customer service lines and meters \nConsulting services \nInstitutional strengthening \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4.  \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFF = multitranche financing facility, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na  Includes taxes and duties of $69.9 million to be financed from government resources through budget allocation. \n\nMFFa \n  \n650.0 \n215.0 \n15.0 \n20.0 \n900.0 \n65.0 \n35.0 \n1,000.0 \n\n \n210.4 \n73.0 \n5.0 \n7.4 \n295.8 \n19.2 \n10.0 \n325.0 \n\n              Subtotal (A) \n\n \n\nTranche 1 \n\n                                                \n21  The specific model will be further evaluated and selected during the implementation stage. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fb  In mid-2015 prices. \nc    Physical  contingencies  computed  at  4.7%  of  the  base  cost.

The Office  of the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  will  be the focal  point for  overall \nintergovernment  agencies.  Azerishiq  OJSC  has  established  a  project \ncoordination  of \nmanagement unit (PMU) for the implementation of the entire MFF.  \n \n23. \nFor  procurement  of  the  turnkey  contracts  for  35  kV/10  kV  substations  and  complete \ntransformer  substations,  national  competitive  bidding  method  will  be  used  by  applying  full \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  document  but \npermitting  (i)  submission  of  bids  in  Azeri  language  and  (ii)  bid  comparison  based  on  the  total \ncost at destination including all taxes and duties. This approach takes into account the nature of \nturnkey contracts, the present condition of local industry, the wide geographic spread of works \nacross  seven  regional  networks,  and  sufficient  availability  of  domestic  contractors  based  on \nAzerishiq\u2019s  previous  successful  experience  and  market  survey.  It  aims  to  encourage  the \ndevelopment  of  domestic  contracting  and  manufacturing  industries  while  ensuring  open \ncompetition to international and national bidders. ADB will closely review the bidding process of \nthese contracts and require further adjustments as necessary to ensure open competition.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe distribution investments are prioritized and optimized to meet the projected demand, \nand reflect appropriate design and planning standards. The latest technology will be applied in \nproject design, installation, and operation.23 Detailed subproject descriptions and technical due \ndiligence are provided in a technical due diligence report.24   \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  will  be  carried  out  for  each  tranche  under  the \ninvestment  program.  For  the  first  tranche,  the  project  investments  yield  an  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  of  13.4%,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  12.0%.  The  economic \nbenefits  are  based  on  reduction  of  outages  and  distribution  losses  in  the  comparison  of  with- \nand without- project cases. The economic internal rate of return exceeds the minimum rate for \nall  the  sensitivities,  and  thus  the  project  is  considered  economically  viable.  To  improve  the \nsector\u2019s  financial  sustainability,  the  government  undertakes  to  implement  a  cost-recovery  tariff \nby  2022.  Incorporating  the  estimation  of  the  cost-recovery  tariff,  the  project  yields  a  financial \ninternal rate of return of \u20132.5%. To the extent that Azerishiq OJSC is not able to fully recover its \n\n                                                \n23  State-of-the-art  equipment\u2014such  as  transformers  and  digital control,  protection,  and telecommunication  facilities; \n\nand smart meters and billing system\u2014will be introduced to improve system operation efficiency and reliability. \n24  Technical Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\ncosts  through  future  tariff  revenues  and  comply  with  the  financial  covenants  of  the  loan,  the \ngovernment  has  also  agreed  to  provide  budgetary  support.  The  program\u2019s  targeted  outcomes \non  reduced  distribution  losses  and  improved  revenue  collection,  in  combination  with  the  tariff \nreform, will increase Azerishiq OJSC\u2019s cash flow and improve its overall financial sustainability. \nThe program will result in an 8% reduction in distribution losses and a 25% increase in revenue \ncollection  by  2022.  Based  on  the  2015  tariff  level  of  AZN0.06/kWh  ($0.057/kWh),  a  1% \nreduction  in  distribution  losses  will  lead  to  a  revenue  increase  of  $10.8  million,  and  a  1% \nincrease in collection rate will lead to a revenue increase of $8.0 million. A TA project to develop \na  tariff  methodology  and  a  public  information  program  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  and \ntariff  increase  will  be  conducted  during  project  implementation  to  support  the  government\u2019s \nefforts in implementing tariff reform. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  governance  risks  for  Azerishiq  OJSC,  including  its  financial  management  and \nprocurement capacities, were assessed. Overall, the financial management risk is assessed to \nbe  substantial. 25  Azerishiq  OJSC\u2019s  financial  management  arrangements,  coupled  with  the \nproposed  mitigation measures  described in  the  FAM,  are  considered  adequate to manage the \nfinances  of  the  project  facilities.  The  procurement  risks  are  substantial  and  the  mitigation \nmeasures are described in the procurement capacity assessment.26 Currently, the PMU handles \nprocurement with support from international and national procurement experts engaged by ADB. \nThe PMU staff have received procurement capacity training from ADB. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Azerishiq OJSC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe investment program will result in positive impacts on improved reliability of electricity \nsupply at the household level. This, in turn, will lead to decreased household spending on solid \nand liquid fuels for heating, cooking, and lighting, and the associated indoor air quality issues. \nHouseholds  will  also  be  able  to  use  more  labor-saving  electrical  appliances  without  risk  of \ndamage  due  to  power  voltage  fluctuations.  The  program  is  also  expected  to  contribute  to \nimproved income-generating opportunities by providing reliable electricity to small industries and \nagricultural  businesses.  The  adverse \nimpacts  of  distribution  network  upgrading  and \nrehabilitation  will  be  minimized  as  much  as  possible  and  it  will  be  ensured  that  they  will  not \ncause  physical  or  economic  displacement  to  the  community,  including  women.  The  specific \ngender development measures under the investment program include (i) at least 20% of female \nstaff from Azerishiq will be trained in key aspects of distribution network management; (ii) newly \nrecruited customer care jobs under the program will include at least 80% female staff members; \n(iii)  at  least  50%  female  representation  will  be  ensured  in  the  consultation  process  during  the \nproject  implementation  period.  The  investment  program  is  classified  as  having  some  gender \nelements.  \n \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n25  By 31 May 2016, Azerishiq is expected to submit its first audited entity financial statements as of 31 December  \n     2015, after its take over of the distribution business from Azerenerji outside the Baku area. \n26  Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n29. \nEnvironment.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared  for \nthe MFF program, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and it provides \nthe environmental management procedures to be adopted for future tranches. Tranche 1 project \nis classified environment category B as impacts are mostly concentrated during the construction \nphase  and  can  be  addressed  through  proper  focused  mitigation  measures.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  conducted  for  the  project.  The  IEE  provides \nenvironmental  management  plans  for  each  type  of  project  activity  and  covers  all  the  likely \nimpacts.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  project  is  not  likely  to  cause  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Public consultations were conducted in January 2015 as part of the IEE \nprocess; the IEE and environmental assessment and review framework were disclosed on the \nADB website.  \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement. The resettlement due diligence carried out for the tranche 1 \nproject  suggests  there  are  no  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  therefore  the  tranche  is \ncategorized  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. However, a land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared to guide \nthe preparation of subsequent tranches and the implementation of tranche 1. \n \n31. \nindigenous people in the project vicinity as defined by the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n \n32.
