THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project will support the construction of two sections, totaling \n53.1 kilometers (km), of the North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR) connecting the regional \ncenter of Clark in Central Luzon with Metro Manila and Calamba, Laguna.1 The project will provide \naffordable, reliable, and safe public transport. It will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and cut \ntravel time from Metro Manila to Clark from 2\u20133 hours by bus to less than 1 hour by rail. The \nproject is financed by a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $2.75 billion from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) ordinary capital resources (OCR), which was approved on 23 May \n2019 by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, and is co-financed by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) in the amount of $2.01 billion. Tranche 1 in the amount of $1.3 billion was approved \nby the ADB Management on 30 May 2019, and the loan agreement was signed on 11 July 2019 \nand became effective on 26 September 2019. ADB is implementing technical assistance for the \nproject preparation and project implementation support.2  \n \n2.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  local,  national,  and  international \nconnectivity improved.3 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency and capacity of \ntransportation along the Manila\u2013Clark corridor improved. The outputs of the project will be: (i) \noutput 1 - new railway line commissioned, and (ii) output 2 - institutional capacity strengthened. \nThe proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will support achieving output 2.4 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Resettlement. Resettlement due to the project will impact the following eight communities \nalong the railway line of the project: Manila, Malolos, Calumpit, Apalit, Sto. Tomas, Angeles, San \nFernando, and Mabalacat. It is estimated that 1,889 households (approximately 7,581 persons) \nwill be resettled.5 Among those, approximately 85% are informal settler families (ISFs); 24% live \nbelow the national poverty line;6 86% are in low income households;7 and 66% have members of \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \n  Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the Republic of the Philippines for the Malolos-Clark Railway Project. \n  Manila. The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project comprises: (i) Malolos\u2013Clark section (51.2 km) from Malolos to Clark and \n  Clark International Airport, and (ii) Blumentritt extension (1.9 km) connecting Solis and Bluementritt stations in Metro \n  Manila District I (City of Manila). Both sections are part of the NSCR and extensions of the Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013\n  Malolos  section  financed  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  The  NSCR  will  be \n  completed  during  2022\u20132025  as  an  integrated  163  km  dedicated  suburban  passenger  railway  system \n  comprising four sections: (i) Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos, (ii) Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013Clark International Airport, (iii) Solis\u2013\n  Blumentritt\u2013Calamba, and (iv) Clark\u2013New Clark City. \n2   ADB. 2018.

Pasig. http://pdp.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PDP-2017-2022-07-20-\n  2017.pdf. \n4  The Design and Monitoring Framework for tranche 1 (Loan 3796-PHI: Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project) will be updated \n  to reflect the outputs and activities of the proposed TA.  \n5  Figures are based on the Feasibility Study Resettlement Action Plans for the Malolos-Clark Railway Project. \n  https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/phi-52083-001-rp and https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/phi-52083-\n  001-rp-0. \n6  The Philippines poverty line is set by the NEDA at P2,096.20 per month per capita. http://www.neda.gov.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/Frequently-Asked-Questions-on-Poverty-Statistics.pdf. \n7  Low income household: P40,000 per household per month. This \u201clow-income household\u201d threshold was mutually \n  agreed between the Department of Transportation (DOTr), National Housing Agency (NHA), ADB, and JICA, in order \n  to provide a sustainable housing solutions for affected ISFs. Ordinarily, to qualify for national social housing, the \n \n ", "2 \nat least one particularly vulnerable group such as persons with disabilities, young children, \npregnant women, and elderly members.8 Under the project\u2019s resettlement action plan (RAP), \ncompensations and transitional assistance will be provided to mitigate lost housing, assets, and \nincome. The RAP facilitates integration of the project affected persons\u2019 (PAPs) access to various \ngovernment services and local livelihood opportunities, by means of entitlements and support \nmeasures aimed at enabling them to at least restore their living standards. The RAP includes the \nLivelihood Restoration and Improvement Program (LRIP), which facilitates access to government \nsocialized housing programs and relocation packages of the Department of Human Settlement \nand Urban Development (DHSUD).9  \n \n4.  Typically, relocation disrupts social networks on which people have relied, and new social \nnetworks at resettlement locations require time to develop.10 The coordination of all resettlement \nactivities and their integration with the project\u2019s implementation will be complex. During the \nrelocation process, some PAPs will be placed in a transitional rental while waiting for their final \nresettlement housing to be constructed. Others will move directly to their final relocation site. The \nRAP,  including  the  LRIP,  will  address  losses  of  property,  housing,  and  livelihood  through \ncompensation, transitional assistance, and livelihood development services. However, given the \npre-existing high levels of vulnerability and susceptibility to impoverishment, and the large scale \nof the anticipated displacement, additional technical assistance is needed to support PAPs on a \ncase-by-case  basis to manage  their financial, social,  and  livelihood  challenges,  while  they \ntransition to a new environment and to maximize opportunities provided under the LRIP. \n \n5.  Poverty and vulnerability. Poverty and vulnerability are influenced and exacerbated by \na multitude of factors including lack of access to sustainable livelihoods and low financial literacy \nand savings. A large proportion of those to be displaced by the project manifest various aspects \nof poverty and vulnerability, including insecure and informal housing, low incomes, as well as \nincomes  from  the  informal  sector.    Displacement  and  resettlement  have  the  potential  to \nexacerbate risks of impoverishment through loss of income sources, disruption to social networks, \nand mismanagement of compensation money by PAPs, if the process of rehabilitation is not \nimplemented effectively. Previous experience of the Philippines government with large-scale \nresettlement of ISFs shows that without concerted efforts to concurrently address inter-related \nvulnerabilities of poverty, low levels of skills, and displacement, there are significant risks of poor \nresettlement outcomes with many PAPs eventually abandoning resettlement housing.11  \n \n6.  Technical assistance. The proposed TA will assist the PAPs to navigate the resettlement \nprocess and effectively access services and benefits under the RAP and its integrated LRIP.The \nproposed TA will apply the \u201cGraduation Approach\u201d (para. 7) to address vulnerability and improve \nresilience and financial stability of the communities resettled under the Malolos-Clark Railway \n \n  recipient household income must be below the Philippines\u2019 municipalpoverty line. The low income threshold allows \n  a greater number of the affected households to receive government housing benefits under the project. \n8  Footnote 1. The socio-economic survey results in the linked document, Resettlement Action Plan, showed that 664 \nout of 1,000 surveyed had at least one factor of vulnerability. \n9  Government of the Philippines. 23 July 2018. Republic Act 11201. Manila. The Act mandated the creation of the new \n  DHSUD. The DHSUD undertakes the functions that were previously performed by the National Housing and Urban \n  Development Coordinating Council, NHA, and the Social Housing  Finance  Corporation  (SHFC),  with  whom  the \n  project has been working until the adoption of the Act. \n10 Barr 2004, Simone Gobien. 2013-2016.

Cambodia. \n11 One such example is the resettlement undertaken by the government under the government\u2019s Northrail Project. \nUnder this project, from 1997 until about 2012, an estimated 15,951 informal settler households were relocated from \nthe right of way of the Philippines National Railway between Malolos to Clark. \n \n ", "3 \n \nProject.12 The TA will establish a system of mentoring by case workers (mentors) and develop an \nonline monitoring system to enhance the resettlement intelligence and data analytics to enable \ntargeting of tailored interventions. The online monitoring system will be used by DOTr to improve \nsupport to PAPs, and the data will be used to inform lessons learned and best practices. The \nonline monitoring system will be turned over to the government at the completion of the TA to \nsupport their work in future resettlement projects.  \n \n7.  Graduation Approach. The proposed TA is based on the Graduation Approach, which is \nbeing piloted by ADB in the Philippines in Negros Occidental.13 The proposed TA is innovative as \n   \nit pilot tests the use of the Graduation Approach in the context of urban resettlement, and provides \nan opportunity to introduce innovation in to DOTr\u2019s approaches in their ongoing resettlement \nactivities. The Graduation Approach is a multi-dimensional, time-bound, and carefully sequenced \nset  of  interventions  that  aim  to  \u201cgraduate\u201d  people  out  of  vulnerability and  into  sustainable \nlivelihoods by addressing the many drivers of poverty.14 It is a tailored and holistic approach to \nmeet  individual  needs  through  targeted  activities  focused  on  livelihood  and  well-being \nimprovement delivered by trained case workers (mentors). The approach employs tools for real \ntime monitoring of PAPs\u2019 wellbeing and progress in stabilizing and re-establishing their living \nstandinards.  \n \n8.  Previously, the Graduation Approach focused on rural development settings. However, \nsince  2013,  the  Graduation  Approach  has  been  piloted  in    urban  resettlement  settings, \ndemonstrating the flexibility of the program.15 There are clear differences in conditions and needs \nbetween poverty alleviation for urban poor and support to vulnerable displaced people: the former \naddresses chronic causes of poverty while the latter mitigates shocks to living conditions induced \nby displacement, which could lead to chronic poverty of the affected community. The proposed \nTA will pilot test proven tools in an urban resettlement context in the Philippines. The TA will \ninform best practices and lessons learned which will help to mitigate negative resettlement \nimpacts  on  future  large-scale  infrastructure  projects.16 The  lessons from  application  of the \nGraduation  Approach  to  urban  resettlements  are  increasingly  important  with  the  trend  for \nmigration  to  urban  centers  and  the  attendant  need  for  infrastructure  development  and \nexpansion.17 The Graduation Approach is also consistent with recent emphasis of the OECD on \nthe  importance  of  integrating  community  wellbeing  in  infrastructure  development,  including \n \n12 The proposed TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2018. The TA \n  is included in the country operations business plan 2020\u20132022 for the Philippines. ADB. 2019. Country Operations \n  Business Plan: Philippines, 2020\u20132022.

This TA is being \n  implemented in 29 barangays across 5 municipalities in Negros Occidental, Philippines. The Graduation Approach \n  has been tested in over 40 countries, mostly in rural settings.  \n14 Other terms used to describe this type of approach include economic inclusion and cash plus (+). \n15 Since 2013, Trickle Up, in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), \n  has piloted the Graduation Approach in urban settings in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Egypt. UNHCR. 2017. Concern \n  Worldwide has also implemented the Graduation Approach in urban settings in Haiti and Kenya. \n16 The proposed TA also builds on the lessons learned from the Promoting Partnerships and Innovation in Poor and \nUnderserved Communities Project (Grant 9162) financed by the JFPR, which aimed to improve access of poor \nfamilies to basic services and livelihood opportunities in a resettlement site, Southville 7, sponsored by the Philippines \ngovernment. The project showed that community integration and organization are crucial for the success of \nresettlement sites. (ADB. 2016. Southville 7: Making Resettlement Work. Manila.) Also, early lessons from ADB\u2019s \nongoing pilot of the Graduation Approach in the Philippines under Unlocking Innovation for Development (footnote \n13) include that: (i) adequate training and preparation are essential for the coaches who work directly with poor \nhouseholds; (ii) the approach may be applicable in urban and peri-urban settings; and (iii) sequencing of interventions \nand their timely delivery are essential. \n17 In the Philippines, migration to urban areas is growing at 54% annually. For Asia generally, only 17% of Asia\u2019s middle- \n  and lower-income  countries\u2019  populations  were  urban  in  1980;  however,  by  2015,  55%  were  urban. \n  https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS  \n \n ", "4 \nprovision of social housing.18 The provision of affordable and social housing infrastructure as \nproposed in the case of resettlement sites for the Malolos-Clark Railway Project can be an \neffective community development tool, particularly for low-income households, but needs to \nincorporate  measures  to  avoid  segregation  and  ensure  integration  in  to  broader  society. \nFurthemore, the G20 principle for integrating social considerations in infrastructure investment \nhighlights the importance of respecting the needs of people, especially those who are vulnerable, \ninto the design, delivery, and management of instrastructure investments, as is exemplified by \nthe RAP and LRIP of the Malolos-Clark Railway Project which will be strengthened by the \nproposed TA.  \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1. Financial Resilience and Stability of Participants Improved. The TA will \nprovide at least 50 one-on-one mentors to deliver weekly home-visits to at least 1,200 participant \nhouseholds and conduct monthly group sessions for sharing ideas, experiences, and lessons \nlearned among mentors and particpants.19 The mentors will help the participants to effectively \nengage with LRIP activities and government social support mechanisms, as well as build capacity \nin household financial planning and management. The TA will provide: (i) support to establish \nstable consumption patterns; (ii) social protection to establish household needs and link them with \ngovernment services; (iii) livelihoods support by counselling participants on engaging in vocational \nand entrepreneurial training best suited to their situation and on application of skill training in \nentrepreneurial development and job search targeting; (iv) financial inclusion activities to aid \nparticipants to access formal and informal savings mechanisms including financial education and \nassistance  to  access  social  insurances  and  micro-loans;  (v)  social  empowerment  through \ncapacity building and training in life-skills such as nutrition, and information on and access to \nhealth;20 and (vi) monitoring to feed data into Output 2 of the TA. A gender and social inclusion \n1;9F\nanalysis shall form part of the assessment to inform Graduation Approach interventions in all the \nforegoing areas.  \n \n10.  Output 2. Urban Resettlement Baseline and Monitoring System Established. The TA \nwill adapt the Graduation Approach\u2019s monitoring system to the project\u2019s context and develop an \nonline monitoring system. In the short-term, this will support the monitoring activities under the \nTA,  while  in  the  long-term,  it  will  become  a  government  tool  for  enhanced  resettlement \nmonitoring.21 Surveys and other modes of data collection will ensure that gender-based causes \nF\nof vulnerability and barriers to sustainable livelihoods are identified, recorded, and analyzed.22 \n21F\nThe surveys will be user-friendly, and allow quick and easy data entry and real-time updating of \ndata and statistics. This data will be available online (cloud-based) with built-in data analytics tools \nto provide an overview of the most critical data. Training of government counterparts will include: \n(i) the Graduation Approach methodology for monitoring and evaluation, and (ii) the online system. \n \n18 OECD, 2019. OECD Reference Note on Environmental and Social Considerations in Quality Infrastructure. \n19 The proposed TA will focus on those ISFs experiencing challenges stabilizing their living conditions after being \nresettled. It is expected that a proportion of relocating ISFs will experience significantly less difficulty readjusting their \nliving standards than others. For example, those relying on wage-based income that is not interrupted by the project \nmay not experience a disruption to their income flow. The target beneficiary households is 1,200 for planning \npurposes, which is less than the total estimated number of ISF households of 1,889. \n20 Health interventions to be based on rapid health impact assessment to be carried out by the team in line with ADB \n2019 HIA Sourcebook, Manila. \n21 Monitoring indicators will be identified by the expert consultant to assist the TA to target households for higher \n  levels of mentoring and assistance as well as to assess the effectiveness of the RAP interventions on an ongoing \n  basis.  \n22 Examples  of  gender-based  causes  of  vulnerability  and  barriers  to  sustainability  include:  (i)  gender-bias  in \nemployment recruitment practices; (ii) violence against women (domestic violence as well as sexual harassment in \nthe workplace) that keep women from getting or keeping stable jobs; (iii)  gender-stereotyping of available jobs; and \n(iv) heavy burden of unpaid domestic and care work that limit women\u2019s time for paid work. \n ", "5 \n \nA detailed gender- and socially inclusive review of the baseline study will be undertaken by the \nLivelihoods Specialists and Monitoring and Evaluation Experts to confirm indicative targets for \nOutput 1.  \n \n11.  Output 3. Urban Resettlement Knowledge Products Produced. The TA will produce a \nseries of knowledge products to present the lessons learned and best practices. These will include: \n(i) visual training tools for government and mentors to implement the Graduation Approach in \nurban resettlement; (ii) communication and advocacy materials; and (iii) reports on the Graduation \nApproach and the testing of the approach in the context of urban resettlement. All knowledge \nproducts will be informed by data, disaggeregated by sex, age, and other social factors relevant \nto vulnerability, include a gender analysis of these data; and use gender-sensitive language and \nimagery. The TA will produce a framework on how to implement the Graduation Approach in \nurban resettlement settings and conduct a series of workshops. An external evaluation expert will \nbe engaged under the TA to undertake an assessment of the effectiveness of the TA activities.  \nThe  external  evaluation  will  be  conducted  at  the  completion  of  the  TA  activities  and  in \ncollaboration  with  the  TA  implementation  team,  government  counterparts,  and  program \nbeneficiaries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis from JFPR,23 administered by ADB.
