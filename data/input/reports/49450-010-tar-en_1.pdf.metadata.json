This transaction TA \nis not, in and of itself, included in any country\u2019s COBP; it is complementary to operations included in \nsuch COBPs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nJustification \n\n2. \nThe proposed regional transaction TA will support the sustainability of energy  investments \nthroughout the Pacific, including projects to be implemented under the Pacific Renewable Energy \nInvestment Facility (\u201cthe Facility\u201d) and financed by ADB or other sources.  \n \n3. \nThe  Facility  was  approved  on  22  June  2017  for  up  to  $200  million  to  finance  a  series  of \nindividual small-value renewable energy projects in the 11 smaller Pacific island countries (PIC-11), \nand support regional approaches for energy sector reform, private sector development, and capacity \nbuilding. \n \n4. \nThe proposed regional transaction TA will support sector reform, private sector development, \nand capacity building in the PIC-11 countries, as well as in countries other than those covered by \nthe Facility (i.e. non-PIC-11 countries - Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste). \n \n5. \nThe  proposed  regional  TA  is  designed  to  allow  for  streamlined  consultant  selection  and \nmobilization, as per Staff Instructions on Business Processes for Transaction Technical Assistance, \nand will be financed from available resources, including from a grant from the Green Climate Fund \napproved for $5 million on 15 December 2016 for these purposes, and administered by ADB. The \nproposed  regional  transaction  TA  will  prepare  utility  reform  and  capacity  building  action  plans \n(programs) whose implementation will be financed under ensuing capital investment grants or loans \nin  countries  covered  under  the  Facility,  or  processed  separately  per  customary  procedures  in \ncountries not covered by the Facility. \n \n6. \nThe provision of adequate electricity service is crucial for ADB\u2019s poverty reduction mandate: \neconomic  growth,  public  health,  and  general  quality  of  life  of  our  developing  member  countries\u2019 \n(DMCs\u2019) populations depends on it. Performance of electric utilities in the Pacific varies greatly from \ncountry to country: service is almost universally available in some countries with highly-concentrated \npopulations (e.g. Nauru, Palau, Samoa), while in other countries, service is available in only a few \nmajor  urban  centers  accounting  for  a  small  percentage  of  the  total  population  (e.g.  Papua  New \nGuinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu). Despite this variation in service availability, most Pacific DMC \nelectric  utilities  share  several  common  features:  (i)  their  financial  and  operational  performance \ngenerally  fails  to  provide  for  efficient  and  sustainable  service  provision;  (ii)  they  represent  a \nsignificant and recurrent drain on the public purse or have otherwise significant welfare-diminishing \neffects due to highly distortionary subsidy and tariff-formation practices; (iii) their legal, policy, and \nregulatory environments fail to provide adequate stimulus for sector performance improvements and \ninvestments (especially from prospective private-sector partners). \n\n                                                \n1  https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/reg-49450-004-rrp \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n7. \nWith  the  exception  of  Fiji,  Pacific  DMCs  remain  heavily  dependent  on  diesel  for  power \ngeneration, which results in high electricity tariffs by international standards with associated negative \nimpacts on economic growth. Expansion of capital-intensive renewable power generation is slow. \nAn  overreliance  on  imported  diesel  for  power  generation  depletes  limited  foreign  reserves  and \nexposes the region\u2019s economies to diesel price shocks. High electricity tariffs increase the cost of \nbusiness for the private sector and place a strain on household incomes. Although renewable power \ngeneration  is  cost-competitive  with  diesel  generation  at  current  levels  of  penetration,  investment \n(including from the private sector) is constrained by capacity barriers, a need for sector reform, a \nlack of financing options. \n \n8. \nDespite many years of ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 support for utility services in \nthe Pacific, service quality and reliability remains poor; in several countries, utility service remains \nunavailable to a significant portion of the population.2 Most utilities have not yet achieved their service \nquality or access objectives, let alone attained financial self-sufficiency. The causes are manifold, \nbut  afflict  most  Pacific  utilities  similarly,  albeit  to  varying  degrees:  governance  arrangements  and \nregulatory  policy  do  not  properly  incentivize  management  to  achieve  appropriate  performance \ntargets;  utilities  are  frequently  abused  as  tools  of  social  policy  or  to  serve  short-term  political \nobjectives; financial management and accounting practices are not designed or practiced to achieve \nappropriate outcome targets; management authorities and functions within utilities are poorly defined \nand  often  fragmented;  utilities\u2019  workforces  are  insufficiently  trained,  supported,  equipped,  or \nincentivized to meet performance expectations, etc. \n \n9. \nThat is not to say that operational and financial sustainability have not been included among \nstated objectives of ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 interventions. To the contrary, \u201ccapacity-\nbuilding\u201d is a nearly universal feature of our investment projects\u2019 designs, and most often included in \nthe  scope  of  services  that  implementation  consultants  are tasked  to  perform.  Typically,  capacity-\nbuilding efforts are undertaken within the context of a discrete investment project\u2019s implementation, \nconsisting of the creation of systems and processes within a project management unit (PMU) that is \nestablished explicitly for the purpose of supporting that project\u2019s implementation. It would appear that \nthe common premise for this approach has been that capacity-building within a PMU will catalyze \ncapacity-development and adoption of sound management practices throughout the utility. In other \nwords,  the  approach  assumes  that  practices,  systems,  and  processes  created  for  the  relevant \ninvestment  project  will  be  absorbed  and  adopted  for  the  entire  utility,  and  that  the  objectives  of \nservice quality, availability, and sustainability will thus be achieved. Unfortunately, this has not been \nobserved. More often, assets financed by ADB or other development partners are absorbed into the \npartner  utilities\u2019  existing  dysfunctional  systems,  where  a  \u201cbuild-neglect-rebuild\u201d  approach  to \ninfrastructure services - the antithesis of sustainability - is common. \n \n10. \nThe  persistent  poor  performance  of  our  Pacific  DMCs\u2019  electric  utilities  calls  for  a  different \napproach  to  investment  in  sustainability.  Attempting  to  engender  better  performance  and  to \ntransform  utilities \nincremental \nimprovements in discrete aspects of their operations and practices, does not appear to be working.  \nA  focused  and  holistic  approach  to  utility  reform  is  necessary  for  achievement  of  wholesale \ntransformation of our client utilities, achievement of service quality and availability objectives, and \ntheir long-term sustainability. \n \n\nthrough  project-specific  capacity  development,  or \n\nthrough \n\n                                                \n2  See the Pacific Power Association\u2019s 2013/2014 Fiscal Year Benchmarking Report of its member utilities\u2019 performance. \n\nThis includes reporting for utilities in Pacific DMCs, with the exception of Timor-Leste. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f11.  Wholesale reform of our Pacific DMCs\u2019 utilities requires a programmatic approach tailored to \neach utility\u2019s needs. This must begin with a comprehensive diagnostic review of each client utility\u2019s \noperations  and  the  environment  in  which  the  utility  operates.  Internal  policies  and  practices  (e.g. \nfinancial  management  and  accounting,  operational  procedures,  maintenance  practices,  customer \nbilling systems) as well as external factors (e.g. state-owned enterprise governance, regulation, and \nrelevant government  policies)  need  to  be  thoroughly  assessed  and  understood  to  determine  how \ndeficiencies,  gaps,  or  incongruence  in  these  and  related  areas  combine  to  impede  a  utility\u2019s \nperformance and achievement of sustainability. It is from here that bespoke reform action plans can \nbe designed for each utility. \n \n12. \nInvestment  in  utility  reform  and  capacity  building  is  crucial  for  our  Pacific  DMCs\u2019  ability  to \nrealize  their  development  objectives,  in  particular  in  an  era  of  heightened  sensitivity  to  energy \nsecurity  and  prioritization  of  transition  to  renewable  energy  sources.  Mobilizing  the  significant \ninvestments  required  to  effect  this  transition  to  capital-intensive  renewable  electricity  generation \ndemands that utilities demonstrate capacity to efficiently operate and maintain their assets, and that \nthey are at once capable of operating in a financially responsible and sustainable manner, and that \nthe legal, policy, regulatory, and governance arrangements in which they operate allow them to do \nso. \n \n13. \nOverall  outcome.  The  proposed  regional  transaction  TA  will  have  the  following  overall \noutcome: energy security in targeted countries will be improved through the generation of lower-cost \nand  cleaner  energy  by  sustainable  power  utilities.  The  TA  will  facilitate  engagement  with \ngovernments  and  electric  power  utilities  to  assess  policy  and  institutional  barriers  to  efficient, \nsustainable  sector  operations  and  impediments  to  increased  capital  investment,  including  private \nsector investment. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs and Activities  \n\nOutput  1:  Comprehensive  assessment  of  utilities\u2019  operations  and  performance. \n14. \nConsultants  will  document  and  report  on  each  utility\u2019s  performance  against  accepted  industry-\nstandard metrics and indicators, such as: SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI,3 system load factor, energy losses, \nrevenue per kWh (disaggregated by customer class), debt to total assets ratio, operating and current \nratios, debt service coverage ratio, and appropriate labor productivity metrics. (Other indicators and \nmetrics may be identified as appropriate and informative, and can be included.) \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Review  of  utilities\u2019  business  processes,  systems,  and  management \npractices.  This  will  include  review  of  utilities\u2019  financial  management  and  accounting,  customer \ninformation and billing systems, budget formulation and execution, asset-management systems and \nmaintenance practices, and customer service policies and practices. The review will also examine \nhigher-level  institutional  efficiencies,  including  organizational  structure,  management  hierarchy, \ndecision-making  processes,  human  resource  policies  and  procedures,  and  the  management \ninformation system(s) underpinning these processes across the organization. \n \n16. \nOutput 3: Review of policy, regulatory, and governance arrangements.  Consultants will \nreview  coherence  of  energy-sector  policies  and  their  alignment  with  countries\u2019  energy  sector \ndevelopment and energy security objectives. Sector regulatory arrangements - in law, policy, and in \npractice \u2013 will be similarly assessed, including as these relate to tariff-setting policies and procedures \n\n                                                \n3  SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI are indexes that measure electric power utility service reliability. (SAIDI is the system average \ninterruption duration index; SAIFI is the system average interruption frequency index; and CAIDI is the customer average \ninterruption duration index.)  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fand  rate  design.  Corporate  governance  arrangements  for  utilities  will  also  be  assessed  for  their \neffectiveness in providing utilities\u2019 managements with resources and incentives for development and \nsustainable operation of power utilities consistent with sector policy objectives and applicable legal \nand  regulatory  requirements.  The  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development\u2019s \n(OECD)  Guidelines  on  Corporate  Governance  for  State-Owned  Enterprises  will  be  used  as  a \ntouchstone for these assessments. \n \n17.  Output 4: Reform recommendations and policy dialogue. Based on the foregoing reviews, \nconsultants will prepare comprehensive recommendations and action plans to inform policy dialogue \nwith governments, as well as the design of consulting services to support the prescribed reforms, to \nbe  included  as  part  of  ensuing  capital  investment  projects  developed  under  the  Facility,  or  other \ninvestment projects in the DMCs\u2019 COBPs. \n \n18. \nOutput  5:  Coordination  on  reform  among  regional  peers.  Consultants  will  employ  a \nconsistent approach across countries covered under the proposed regional transaction TA.  This will \nenable coordination and cross-learning among utilities across the region, as well as among other \ndevelopment  partners.  Consultants  will  coordinate  with  the  Pacific  Power  Association  in \ndisseminating lessons learned among utilities within the region. \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nThe TA is estimated to cost $5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Green \n\n19. \nClimate Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \nProceeds  from  the  grant  from  the  Green  Climate  Fund  may  not  be  used  for  project \n20. \npreparation activities such as feasibility studies, environmental and social safeguards documents, \nfinancial  modeling,  and  other  related  activities  that  are  eligible  for  the  GCF  Project  Preparation \nFacility.  The grant will only be used as a means to strengthen capacity building and sector reform.4 \nProceeds from the grant may only be used for assistance to countries that have signed a no-objection \nletter to the program of support approved by the GCF board under which the grant was made, in a \nform acceptable to the GCF. \n \nGovernments are expected to provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and \n21. \nother in-kind contributions. Governments are informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n22. \nThe TA activities for an ensuing project start only after the project  concept paper on such \nensuing project is approved by ADB, and only after submission by the relevant country\u2019s government \nof a no-objection letter, satisfactory in form and substance to the Green Climate Fund, indicating the \ncountry\u2019s acceptance of grant support from Green Climate Fund for the purposes described herein.  \nDeployment of consultants will generally be scheduled and agreed in parallel with preparation of the \nrelevant ensuing investment project concept paper (or equivalent under the Facility).
