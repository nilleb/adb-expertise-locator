(ASA)  for  the \nFostering Women\u2019s Empowerment Through Financial Inclusion in Conflict-Impacted and Lagging \nProvinces Project in the Philippines. \n \n2. \nThe  project  entails  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  providing  a  multi-tranche  debt \nfinancing facility,  structured  as  a  senior  bond  to ASA for  (i)  expanding  its  portfolio of  business \nloans for microenterprises,1 and (ii) strengthening its resource base for providing loans for micro \nhousing,  water  supply,  and  on-site  sanitation  to  its  women  borrowers. 2 ADB\u2019s  facility  will  be \ntargeted at women borrowers, most of whom own and manage these microenterprises. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description  \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic and banking sector. The economy of the Philippines sustained robust growth \nover  2010\u20132017,  with  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  6.4%  per  year 3 and  an \nestimated 6.8% in 2018,4 well above the Association of Southeast Asian Nations level of 5.0%.5 \nOn the supply side, growth has been broad-based across services and agriculture, while rising \nhousehold demand and the renewed emphasis on public spending under the \u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d \ninitiative  have  provided  the  demand  impetus.  6  Despite  sustained  national  growth,  regional \ndisparities  persist  in  the  growth  and  distribution  of  national  domestic  output. 7 The  islands  of \nVisayas  (regions  VI,  VII,  VIII)  and  Mindanao  (regions  IX\u2013XIII  and  the  Autonomous  Region  in \nMuslim Mindanao), which are home to 44.0% of the total population, contributed only 27.0% of \nthe GDP in 2017,8 while the Luzon islands, with 56.0% of the population, contributed 73.0% of \nthe GDP. Notwithstanding its larger population, the Luzon islands also registered the highest real \n\n                                                \n1   The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has classified enterprises based on their asset size: (i) microenterprises \nhave assets of up to \u20bd3 million, (ii) small enterprises have assets of \u20bd3 million\u2013\u20bd15 million, and (iii) medium-sized \nenterprises have assets of more than \u20bd15 million. \n\n2   These microenterprises are well below the DTI\u2019s \u20bd3 million threshold. They are engaged in retail distribution (sari-\nsari stores), trading (tingi-tingi operations), small-scale food services (carinderia), bakery, carpentry, warehousing, \nsmall-scale construction, automotive repairs, and basic manufacturing activities which generally employ unskilled or \nsemiskilled labor. \n\n3   Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). 2017.

While these \ntwo  lagging  regions  contribute  a  marginally  higher  proportion  of  output  from  primary  activities  (54%  of  domestic \nagriculture and fishing output is generated from Visayas and Mindanao), this is not adequate to mitigate the regional \ndifferences. The lagging regions also have a higher reliance on staple crops and lower value-added agriculture and \nfisheries. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fper capita gross regional domestic product (GRDP)\u2014three times above the national average.9 In \ncontrast, 17 of the 20 poorest provinces of the Philippines are in Visayas and Mindanao. Many of \nthese  provinces  have  an  average  GRDP  that  is  one-third  of  the  national  average.  The \nGovernment of the Philippines has taken measures to reduce these regional imbalances and cut \nincome  inequality. 10  Widening  financial  inclusion  and  extending  the  outreach  of  the  formal \nfinancial system to these lagging regions is a key priority.11 \n \n4. \nBanking sector overview. The banking system in the Philippines has strengthened, in \ntandem with the country\u2019s economic growth. It has benefitted from rising consumption levels, an \nincrease in retail credit, a supportive credit cycle, and overall benign conditions in the domestic \nasset  prices,  and  property  markets. 12 Philippine  banks  have  focused  primarily  on  corporate \nlending (70.0% of their total assets), while their consumer lending activity (30.0% of assets) has \nbeen focused largely on secured-asset financing.13 While the banking systems\u2019 physical outreach \nbroadly overlaps with the distribution of gross domestic output, regulatory provisions have been \nimplemented to encourage wider financial inclusion through the banking network. \n \nPhilippine banks are mandated to allocate capital to under-penetrated and marginalized \n5. \nsegments,14 specifically for (i) micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises;15 and (ii) agriculture-\nrelated activities. While banks have attempted to expand their reach to these segments, this credit \nallocation  has  been  well  below  the  mandatory  levels.  The  share  of micro,  small,  and medium-\nsized enterprises in the overall credit provided by the Philippine banking system declined from \n10.0% in 2007 to 3.3% in 2017. In this environment, the width and depth of financial inclusion, \nspecifically  access  to  credit  and  savings  from  formal  financial  institutions  for  micro  borrowers, \nhave worsened from 2011 to 2017.  \n \n6. \nAccess to finance by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The microfinance \nsector is highly fragmented, with rural banks, microfinance nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nand cooperatives providing microfinance services. NGOs play an active role in the microfinance \nlending space, accounting for 79% of the microfinance borrowers in the country. The top three \nmicrofinance providers account for more than 50% of the market. Banks are hesitant to provide \ncredit  to  micro  borrowers  because  of  their  perceived  high  risk,  very  small  loan  sizes,  lack  of \ncollateral, and the extensive operating arrangements required to reach the micro borrowers. Small \nenterprise owners, predominantly women, are therefore vulnerable to informal moneylenders that \ncharge interest rates of more than 250% per annum and exploit their limited financial literacy. \n \n7. \nWidening financial inclusion coverage for accelerating post-conflict settlement. The \npoorest  regions  of  the  Philippines  are  in  Mindanao, 16  where  development  work  has  been \n                                                \n9   The  GRDP  for  Luzon  (excluding  NCR)  was  \u20bd5.4  billion  for  2017.

Source: Standard & Poor\u2019s. 2017. Sector \nReview 2017. Singapore. \n\n14  BSP Circular 625 (2008), Magna Carta for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, requires that banks, for 10 years \nfrom June 2008 to June 2018, allocate (i) at least 8% of their total loan portfolio for micro and small enterprises and \n(ii) at least 2% for medium-sized enterprises. \n\n15  Banks in the Philippines are required to follow the classification laid out by DTI (footnote 1). \n16  The poverty rate in Mindanao was reported at 36% in 2015, compared with 13% for Luzon and 28% for the Visayas. \n\nEleven of the 20 poorest provinces of the Philippines are in Mindanao, with poverty levels exceeding 40%. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fconstrained by the armed conflict and a persistent breakdown  in peace and economic activity. \nThe  crisis  heightened  in  Marawi  City  in  May  2017,  culminating  in  a  5-month  conflict  between \ngovernment-armed forces and militants, leaving an estimated 120,000 residents dislocated. Other \nprovinces of Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao have also been conflict-\nimpacted. While government relief works gain momentum, ADB\u2019s facility will also help rebuild this \nfledgling  economic  base  by  providing  funding,  primarily  to  women  borrowers  (who  are  more \nseverely impacted) for their microenterprises and micro housing needs. \n \nInvestment rationale. ASA is one of the largest microfinance providers in the country and \n8. \none of the most reputable. Partnering with ASA will help strengthen it by providing wider access \nto finance for some of the most marginalized sections of society. This will also help revalidate the \ncommercial sustainability of microfinance and help attract private capital to this segment. ADB \nhas selected ASA for its strong track record, solid operations, extensive on-the-ground presence, \nhigh standards of governance, and efficient reporting practices, which are critical for reaching the \nmost  underbanked  segments  of  the  population.  ASA  provides  finance  to  individuals  who  own \nmicroenterprises  that  engage  in  small-scale  trading,  retail,  services,  and  agriculture  activities, \nwhich are critical for gainful employment\u2014generating income and sustaining livelihoods in lagging \nparts  of  Philippines. With more  than  70%  of  its branches  in  lagging  provinces  and towns,  and \nabout  65%  of  its  portfolio  in  provinces  with  a  lower  level  of  penetration  by  banks  and  formal \nfinancing  institutions,  ASA  is  a  partner  of  choice  for  ADB.  In  contrast  to  trends  across  the \nmicrofinance sector in Philippines, ASA maintained robust asset growth, high operating efficiency, \nlow nonperforming loan levels, and a strong capital base and credit metrics in fiscal year (FY) \n2017. \n  \nB. \n \n9. \nOverview. ASA, headquartered in Manila, is a nonprofit, non-stock corporation (structured \nas  an  NGO),  specializing  in  extending  microfinance  (lending  and  savings)  services.  Since  its \nestablishment in 2004, ASA has been among the largest microfinance providers in the country \nwith  respect  to  portfolio  size,  branch  coverage,  coverage  of  less-developed  areas,  and  the \nnumber of micro borrowers covered under its operations. ASA provides financing to low-income \nwomen  borrowers,  focusing  on  small  loan  amounts  for  meeting  their  livelihood  and  business \nneeds. It also extends micro housing loans and agri loans in the under-serviced areas. \n \n10. \nASA focuses on providing small, short duration (up to 12 months, mostly 6 months) loans \nfor  microenterprises  in  rural  areas,  at  transparent  rates  and  with  relatively  easy  access  and \nrepayment arrangements. The loans are targeted solely at women, with the typical microfinance \ninstitution (MFI) step-up arrangement for good credit repeat borrowers.17 Each interface with the \nborrower is crucial for mobilizing savings with ASA (voluntary savings). This helps ensure high \nlevels of collections for ASA, resulting in very low delays or defaults. These savings also enable \nASA to deliver on the welfare and not-for-profit aspect of its operations. \n \nC. \n \nOwnership.  ASA  was  established  by  two  philanthropists\u2014former  Ambassador  to  the \n11. \nVatican Howard Q. Dee and Kamrul H. Tarafder\u2014for alleviating poverty in the Philippines through \nlivelihood  support.  Subsequent  donations  from  the  Assisi  Development  Foundation,  the  Ninoy \nand  Cory  Aquino  Foundation,  and  the  PLDT  Smart  Foundation,  completed  the  close  group  of \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n                                                \n17  Women borrowers with good credit history can avail of new microbusiness loans at higher loan size and/or subsidiary \n\nloans.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fASA\u2019s  key  donors.  Since  2007,  ASA  has  not  obtained  any  grant  or  included  a  new  donor \ncontributor. \n \n12.  Management.  The  organization  has  four  levels:  (i)  policy  maker  (Board  of  Trustees  or \nBOT), (ii) central management, (iii) middle management, and (iv) the field. The field staff have \ngood local knowledge and are strong in delivering and monitoring collections. Its operations are \nenabled and strongly supported by a robust in-house information technology system, which allows \nfor  real-time  overview  of  portfolio,  disbursement,  and  collection  performance;  managing  cash \nsettlements between branches and the head office; and tracking of operating activities. \n \n13. \nASA  has  established  risk  management  practices  and  has  set  conservative  thresholds, \nwith  reference  to  deploying  leverage,  maintaining  a  strong  loan  portfolio,  and  funding  its \noperations. It has pursued portfolio growth through a balanced mix of an increase in geographic \ncoverage and a captive in-house branch network, and an increase in the number of borrowing \nclients. It has also enhanced its risk management oversight  by formalizing specific board-level \ncommittees.  The  financing  engagement  with  ADB  will  require  a  higher  level  of  oversight  and \nreporting, which will further strengthen this function. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nA. \n \n14. \nADB  will  provide  debt  financing  to  ASA  for  an  amount  of  up  to  $30  million,  in  peso \nequivalent, in three equal tranches with tenors of 3, 4, and 5 years. ADB has structured smaller \ndrawdown portions to optimize funding costs for ASA. The grace periods for the three tranches \nwould also allow ASA to repay its existing borrowings with its operating cash flow and steadily \ndraw  funds  from  ADB  for  its  incremental  onlending  activity,  while  maintaining  its  strong  credit \nmetrics. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nUse  of  proceeds.  The  proceeds  from  ADB\u2019s  financing  would  be  onlent  to  (i)  improve \naccess to finance on low-cost, transparent, and fair terms, for micro borrowers; and (ii) improve \nliving  conditions  for  ASA\u2019s  borrowers,  by  providing  them  with  micro  housing  loans  for  the \nrefurbishment  and  strengthening  of  their  homes  and  for  solar,  on-site  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities. All the loans will be for ASA\u2019s women borrowers. \n \n16. \nReporting  arrangements.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  will \nmonitor the project during its tenor. ASA will, at predetermined intervals and as stipulated, provide \nADB  with  financial  reports,  including  (i)  semiannual  portfolio  reporting  and  financial  updates; \n(ii) six  monthly  compliance  reports  on  financial  covenants;  (iii)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements; and (iv) annual reporting on environmental and social performance. \n \n17. \nEvaluation. ADB\u2019s PSOD will prepare monitoring reports and submit them to the Office \nof Risk Management regularly, and at least annually. PSOD will submit the first report no later \nthan 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nBroaden access to finance for microenterprises owned by women in lagging areas. \nAs  noted,  access  to  finance  for  micro  and  women  borrowers  in  the  Philippines  is  severely \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fconstrained. ADB funding will broaden access to formal institutional finance, helping borrowers \nescape the predatory and exploitative lending practices of informal moneylenders. ADB\u2019s targeted \nfunding  for  female  borrowers  in  less  developed  and  previous  conflict  areas  will  also  support \neconomic recovery, employment, and income-generating activities.  \n \n19. \nAccess  to  finance  for  a  developmental  and  commercial  microfinance  institution. \nMicrofinance institutions must continuously diversify their funding base. Longer-tenor financing, \nstructured through ADB\u2019s three-tranche facility, will also facilitate diversifying ASA\u2019s liability profile \nand improve on the incompatibility caused by the immediate debt-servicing payments.  \n \n20. \nImprove living conditions and reduce regional imbalances. ADB\u2019s participation in this \nproject will help ASA\u2019s women borrowers, predominantly from the base of the income pyramid \n(defined as the poorest 60% of households) access longer-term loans for their micro-housing and \nwater  and  sanitation  needs,  thereby  improving  their  household  living  conditions.  As  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing specifically targets lagging and conflict-impacted regions; this focus, supplemented with \nASA\u2019s transparent lending practices and outreach, helps reduce regional disparities and fulfills a \nsignificant  objective  of  inclusive  finance.  The  project  has  a  high  development  impact  and \ncontributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (reduce inequality within and \namong countries). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\n \nA. \n \nImpact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132022 \n21. \nobjectives  of  encouraging  efficiency  and  innovation  in  microfinance  and  strengthening  the \neffectiveness of financial inclusion initiatives by focusing on the efficient delivery of microfinance \nproducts and services for Filipinos.18 ADB\u2019s funding would provide (i) easy and affordable access \nfor women to finance microenterprises; (ii) finance for improving living conditions of ASA\u2019s women \nmicro  borrowers  \u2013  specifically  through  loans  targeted  for  micro-housing  and  water  sanitation \nneeds; (iii) widening financial inclusion and lower regional disparities in terms of access to finance; \nand  (iv)  revival  of  economic  activity  in  the  conflict-impacted  parts  of  southern  Philippines \n(Mindanao).  \n \n22. \nmicrofinance borrowers in lagging areas and conflict-affected areas. \n \n23. \nOutput. The  outputs  of the  project  will  be  the  (i)  increased  ability  of  ASA  to serve and \nexpand  operations,  especially  in lagging  provinces;  and  (ii)  improved  institutional  capacity  and \noverall governance and transparency. \n\nOutcome.  The  project  outcome  will  be  to  increase  access  to  finance  for  women \n\n \nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nB. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for the finance sector \nby helping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, products, and services.19 The proposed \ntransaction  contributes  to  finance  sector  development  by  supporting  the  growth  of  a  nonbank \nfinancial institution, which is an important component of the finance sector in the Philippines.

ADB\u2019s  Midterm Review also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without \naccess to formal financial services, women, lower-income people, and underserved segments of \nthe  population  will  be  excluded  from  the  growth  process  and  its  benefits.  According  to  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the Philippines, 2011\u20132016,20 and the ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness  plan  (Philippines),  2017\u20132019, 21  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  will  continue  to \nsupport the finance sector and the financial inclusion theme in the country, which is also a high \npriority for the government. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).22 The proposed ADB debt financing is classified as category FI treated as C \nfor impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. ASA\u2019s loans \nhave  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous people. ASA\u2019s financing program is not expected to result \nin  micro-loans  that  will  finance  activities  that  may  be  categorized  A  or  B  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n26. \nASA  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list;  (ii)  exclude  activities  with \ncategory A and B environment and social safeguard impacts; (iii) ensure that investments using \nADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by applicable national laws \nand regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy; and (iv) take \nmeasures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards. ASA will confirm this in \nits  periodic  report  to  ADB  and  need  not  apply  any  other  specific  safeguard  or  social \nrequirements.23 \n \n27. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  ASA  has  incorporated \nmeasures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. A \ngender action plan has been prepared to support the gender equity theme classification of the \nproject. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nASA was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n\n                                                \n20  ADB. 2011.
