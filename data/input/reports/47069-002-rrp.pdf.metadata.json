This  has  resulted  in  loss  of  life  and  property  and  has  required  costly  investments  in \nlarge-scale water management infrastructure and reinforcement of river embankments. \n \nLocated  in  northern  Henan  province,  Hebi  city  has  a  population  of  1.6  million  and \n4. \nencompasses 83 kilometers (km), or 52%, of the Qihe River. Originating from Shanxi province, \nthe Qihe River flows into the Weihe River and then the Hai River and finally into the Bohai Sea. \nEcosystem  degradation,  poor  flood  management  capacity,  pollution,  and  weak  intersector \ncoordination are the key issues affecting the ecological integrity of the Qihe River basin that this \nproject will address in an integrated manner. \n \n5. \nEnvironmental  degradation  in  the  upper  Qihe  River  watershed.  Environmental \nconditions along the Qihe  River have deteriorated  because of intensive  economic  development \nand increasing human populations, while vegetation, wetlands, and water quality along the river \nhave  declined  because  of  urbanization,  modification  of  the  river  hydrology,  habitat  loss  and \ndeforestation,  livestock  grazing,  agriculture,  overextraction  of  water,  and  nonpoint  source \npollution. The 1,300 hectares of degraded hills within the scope of this project in the upper Qihe \nare almost completely devoid of vegetation. The pilot Qihe River National Wetland Park (NWP) in \nthe river\u2019s upper reaches requires habitat restoration and improved facilities and management.4 \n \nPoor flood management capacity. In the lower Qihe River, current flood management \n6. \npractices  have  resulted  in  waterlogging  and  flooding  in  selected  rural  areas  as  a  result  of \ndiversion of water for emergency storage of flows that exceed the dike crest levels. In addition, \nbecause the old embankments and dikes are in poor condition because of erosion and washout, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  PRC  conceptualizes  ecological civilization  as  a  development  approach  that aims  to balance the  relationship \nbetween humanity and nature. In order to achieve ecological civilization, the PRC has selected candidate locations \nfor \u201cwater ecological civilization\u201d to establish good practices in ecological and water resources management. \n\n3  Ecosystem  services  are  the  direct  and  indirect  contributions  of  ecosystems  to  human  well-being.  They  support \n\ndirectly or indirectly our survival and quality of life. http://biodiversity.europa.eu/topics/ecosystem-services \n\n4  \"Pilot\" refers to the State Forestry Administration\u2019s practice for national wetland parks prior to official designation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe  vulnerability  of  these  sections  to  potential  dike  failure,  catastrophic  flooding,  and  crop \ndamage is high. The flood management capacity of selected tributaries and canals of the Qihe \nRiver  in  Qi  county  and Qibin  district  is  also  limited  to  a  less than  1-in-5 year flood  because of \nheavy siltation, congestion with solid waste, and degraded banks. \n \n7. \nWastewater  and  solid-waste  pollution.  The  Qihe  River  and  its  canals  are  highly \npolluted. The surface water quality of the river\u2019s mainstream exceeds the class III environmental \nquality  standard for  surface  water,  while that  of the  canals  exceeds  class  V.5 The  city  sewage \nnetwork  currently  covers  60%  of  Qibin  district  and  Qi  county,  while  the  three  wastewater \ntreatment  plants  (WWTPs)  that  serve  the  same  project  areas  cannot  accommodate  the \nincreasing volumes of wastewater. As a result, untreated wastewater discharges directly to the \nlower  Qihe  River  mainstream  and  tributaries.  The  lack  of  waste  transfer  stations  has  also \nresulted in poor solid-waste management. \n \n8. \nPoor  institutional  and  technical  monitoring  capacity  for  river  basin  and  water \nresource  management. While the management of  the Qihe  River  involves  numerous  agencies, \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) only has limited intersector coordination because \nof  a  lack  of  mechanisms  for  information  sharing  and  monitoring  capacity.  The  established \nmultisector city-level project management office (PMO) is the first step toward stronger intersector \ncoordination.  Continued  capacity  building  will  be  essential  to  supporting  IWRM,  including \ndeveloping a management information system (MIS) and ecological monitoring program, to guide \ninteragency decision-making on flood management, conservation, and other issues. \n \n9. \nTo address these issues, the HCG has prepared various plans, including the Master Plan \nfor  Hebi  City  Qihe  River  Ecological  Areas  for  2010\u20132020  and  the  Hebi  City  Urban  Flood  and \nWaterlogging  Control  Plan  for  2011\u20132020.6 The  HCG  requested  that  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) (i) provide lending support to implement environmental improvement and ecological \nconservation  in  and  around  the Qihe River by  integrating key activities  in the  above-mentioned \nplans in a consistent manner using innovative yet cost-effective approaches; and (ii) support the \ncity\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  this  pilot  initiative  on  ecological  civilization,  which  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration  project  for  other  cities  or  provinces.7 The  project  will  demonstrate  an  integrated \nand holistic approach to ecosystem and water resources management in one of the most flood-\nprone  and  ecologically  sensitive  sections  of  a  river  system  by  combining  structural  and \nnonstructural measures to the differing conditions of the river sections.  \n \n10. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  contributes  to  the  PRC\u2019s  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  and \nprosperous society through environmentally sustainable growth and the priorities of its Thirteenth \nFive-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020.  The  decision  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session  of  the  18th  Central \nCommittee of the Communist Party of the PRC supports the establishment of a system to protect \necosystems. 8  The  project  also  supports  ADB  priorities  as  stated  in  the  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020; 9  Environment  Operational  Directions,  2013\u20132020; 10  Water  Operational  Plan, \n                                                \n5  Following  the  GB  3838-2002  environmental  quality  standard  for  surface  water  of  the  PRC,  class  III  means  the \nwater  is  suitable  for  drinking and  swimming, class  IV  for  general industrial  and  recreational  use,  and  class  V  for \nagriculture and landscaping. Class V+ means the water is unsuitable for any purpose. \n\n6  These plans set targets for 2020, including an improvement in the flood management capacity of the lower reaches \n\nof the Qihe River and its tributaries to just a 1-in-20 year flood. \n\n7  The project is included in the 2016 lending pipeline in ADB. 2016.

The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  previous  ADB-financed \nprojects  and  policy-oriented  studies  on  IWRM,  environmental  and  ecosystem  improvement, \nwetland  and lake management  and  restoration,  and  urban\u2013rural  integration  in the  PRC.  Major \nlessons  incorporated  into  the  project  design  include  the  need  for  (i)  an  integrated  approach, \nincluding  structural  and  nonstructural  measures;  (ii)  strong  leadership  and  governance  in \nenvironmental management; (iii) adequate consultation and better communication with affected \npeople;  (iv)  project  activities \nthat  encourage  community  participation;  (v)  sustainable \nmanagement  of  facilities  based  on  a  realistic  tariff  structure;  and  (vi)  management  and  data \ninformation systems for IWRM decision-making. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact of the project will be to restore ecosystem services in the Qihe River basin. \nThe outcome of the project will be to demonstrate integrated environmental management in the \nQihe River basin in Hebi city. The project will improve water security and flood management and \nenhance the delivery of ecological services. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe project will have four outputs: (i) restored vegetation and wetlands in the upper Qihe \nRiver  basin,  (ii)  improved  flood  management  capacity  of  the  lower  Qihe  River,  (iii)  enhanced \nwastewater and solid-waste management in the Qihe River basin, and (iv) strengthened technical \nand institutional support system and capacity for integrated management of the Qihe River basin. \n \n14. \nOutput  1  will  include  two  subcomponents:  (i)  ecological  restoration  of  the  Qihe  River \nupstream watershed, and (ii) restoration of the pilot Qihe River NWP. Under subcomponent 1, \napproximately  1,300  hectares  of  degraded  hills  in  the  upper  Qihe  will  be  reforested  to  reduce \nsoil  erosion.  Under  subcomponent  2,  activities  in  the  NWP  will  include  (i)  restoring  wetland \nhabitats  and  riverbanks,  (ii)  providing  fencing  and  signage  to  protect  targeted  species,  (iii) \nimproving  park  infrastructure,  (iv)  establishing  a  park  management  agency  and  management \nplan, (v) establishing a park monitoring program, and (vi) encouraging community participation \nin park monitoring. \n \nOutput 2 will include three subcomponents: (i) improvement of the Qihe River mainstream \n15. \nwatercourse in Qi county; (ii) rehabilitation of tributaries in Qi county (Side River, Zhaojia Canal, \nHucheng River, and Zhejing River; approximately 30 km in total); and (iii) restoration of five canals \nin Qibin district (about 11.3 km in total) and revegetation of about 11.5 km riverside in Qi county. \n \n16. \nOutput  3  will  support  improved  wastewater  and  solid-waste  management.  The  main \nsubcomponents  are  (i)  Qibin  district  wastewater  management,  (ii)  Qi  county  wastewater \nmanagement, and (iii) solid-waste management in both Qi county and Qibin district. \n \n17. \nOutput 4 will support (i) the establishment of a Qihe River ecological monitoring program; \n(ii)  the  development  of  a  Qihe  River  MIS;  and  (iii)  training  and  capacity  building  on  ecological \n                                                                                                                                                       \n10 ADB. 2013.

The project demonstrates an integrated and holistic \napproach to  ecosystem and  water resources  management  in one  of the most flood-prone  and \necologically  sensitive  sections  of  a river  system.  The  integrated  approach  combines  structural \nand  nonstructural  measures  to  the  differing  conditions  of  the  river  sections,  and  include  (i) \nwetland protection and soil erosion reduction, (ii) reduction of pollution loads from sewage and \nsolid  waste,  (iii)  flood  management,  (iv)  capacity  building  of  community  \u201criver  guards,\u201d14 (v) \nestablishment  of  community  environmental  monitors,  and  (vi)  development  of  the  MIS.  The \nleadership by the HCG and the establishment of an intersector PMO is also a unique feature of \nthis  project.  As  Hebi  city  has  been  selected  as  a  national  pilot  city  for  water  ecological \ncivilization, and pilot NWP, this project offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate a successful \nIWRM model and future replication. \n \nD. \n \n19. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $325.4 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nAmounta \n \n34.6 \n70.4 \n153.0 \n 3.9 \n\nItem \nA.

Contingenciesc \nC. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $10.68 million, of which $5.91 million will be financed by government counterpart funds \nand $4.77 million by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan. The amount of taxes and duties to be financed by \nADB  is  based  on  the  principles  that  (i)  the  amount  will  be  within  the  reasonable  threshold  identified  during  the \ncountry  partnership  strategy  preparation  process,  (ii)  the  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  financed  by  the  ADB  loan \ndoes  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project,  (iii)  the  taxes  and  duties  apply  only  to  ADB-financed \nexpenditures, and (iv) the financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n261.9 \n55.5 \n8.0 \n325.4 \n\nb  As of 2 August 2015. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 10% of base costs. Price contingencies were computed using the escalation \nfactors published by ADB on local and foreign components of the project costs, and include provision for potential \nexchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \n\nd  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at the \n5-year US dollar fixed-swap rate plus a spread of 0.5% and a maturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for \nthe ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \n\nSource: Hebi city government and ADB estimates. \n \n20. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help finance  the  project.  The  loan will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  (i)  a grace \n\n                                                \n13 For  wastewater  management,  the  government  has  agreed  to  continue  to  pursue  tariff  reform.  The  project \nimplementation consultants will support the HCG to undertake annual tariff reviews for wastewater tariff and assess \nthe impact and/or affordability of the tariff increase on the poor. \n\n14 River guards refer to a number of community representatives appointed by the HCG to monitor and report illegal \nactivities or issues affecting the Qihe River. They currently receive little or no training on river health monitoring. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nperiod of 5 years, (ii) a straight-line repayment method, (iii) an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  (iv)  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount, and (v) \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreements. The average loan maturity is \n15.25  years  and the  maturity  premium  payable to ADB  is  0.10%  per  annum.  Finance  charges \nduring implementation will be capitalized. \n \n21. \nThe  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  46.1%  of  the  project  cost, \nincluding civil works, goods, and consulting services. The local governments of Hebi city, Qibin \ndistrict,  and  Qi  and  Xun  counties  will  finance  the  remaining  53.9%  of  the  project  cost.

The  HCG\u2019s \ndomestic  feasibility  study  reports  are  technically  sound  and  provide  sufficient  information  on  the \ndesign feasibility. International and national consulting services will provide the necessary technical \nsupport to ensure that international best practices are integrated into the final detailed design, and \nare  applied  during  construction  and  implementation.  Solid-waste  management  and  nonstructural \nproject  components  have  strengthened  the  integrated  approach  of  the  project.  Negative  impacts \nhave  been  avoided  by  (i)  the  removal  of  some  activities,  particularly  the  construction  of  two \nmainstream barrages, a captive garden for wild cranes, a wildlife rescue center, a \u201creed maze,\u201d fish \nreleases,  and  fish  and  bird  nests  in  the  pilot  NWP;  and  (ii)  the  use  of  invasive  plant  species  for \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nrevegetation. During the preparation phase, the environmental assessments were strengthened by \nthe inclusion of heavy metal sampling (to help identify spoil disposal locations). \n \n26. \nClimate  change.  ADB\u2019s  preliminary  climate  risk screening  indicated the project  was  at \nhigh  risk  of  being  impacted  by  climate  change.  A  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  was \nconducted  to  identify  the  threat  that  climate  change  presents  to  project  viability,  assuming  a \ndesign  life  of  40\u201350  years.  Modeling  indicates  that  during  2020\u20132070,  mean  annual \ntemperatures  will  rise,  the  risk  of  extreme  climate  events  will  increase,  and  variability  in \nprecipitation will increase, causing more rainy or dry days. This could cause flood damage to the \nproject embankments, channels, and pipelines; excessive sediment deposition in the lower Qihe \nRiver and canals, which would necessitate more channel maintenance; and higher mortality or \ndisease  of  the  planted  vegetation  because  of  altered  temperatures  or  water  availability.  To \naccommodate  these  risks,  project  structures  have  been  designed  to  PRC  flood  protection \nstandards  and  will  be  regularly  maintained,  embankments  with  a  porous  design  have  been \nselected, a flood warning system will be implemented, plant species for revegetation have been \nselected for suitability to the seasonally harsh climate and local soil conditions, and training on \nIWRM  and  wetland  management  will  be  given.  As  a  result,  flood  control  capacity  will  be \nimproved from a 1-in-3 to a 1-in-5 year recurrence interval for the project canals and the 1-in-20 \nyear capacity for the Qihe River mainstream will be secured. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-\nproject  scenarios.  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  reflect  (i)  the  capital  cost  for  construction, \nincluding  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  monitoring \ncosts; and (ii) operation and maintenance costs, which include routine annual maintenance and \nperiodic  major  maintenance.  Least-cost  analysis  shows  that  the  chosen interventions  are  both \nengineering preferred and cost-effective. The economic benefits for the project are derived from \nbeneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay to improve the water quality of the Qihe River and to avoid flood \ndamage. The economic internal rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 13.3% and \nthe net present value is CNY165.3 million, indicating economic viability of the project. \n \nA financial evaluation was conducted on the solid-waste and wastewater subprojects to \n28. \nassess  viability  as  both  offer  some  degree  of  cost  recovery.  The  analysis  indicated  that  the \nsolid-waste  fee  is  not  designed  to  recover  operating  costs,  while  the  wastewater  tariff  is \nintended  to  recover  only  the  treatment  costs.  Thus,  the  project  does  not  receive  incremental \nbenefits  sufficient  to  recover  all  project  costs  and  is  deemed  not  viable  from  this  perspective. \nADB\u2019s decision to invest in the project is based on the economic benefits and the government\u2019s \ncommitment to maintain sound fiscal capacity to absorb project costs. \n \nA  financial  analysis  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to \n29. \nabsorb incremental project costs and to ascertain sustainability based on historical performance. \nThe  analysis  showed  that  Qi  county  and  Qibin  district  may  experience  undue  fiscal  pressure \nfrom counterpart funds contribution. The local governments have historically had annual budget \nsurpluses,  which  can  be  assumed  as  unappropriated  for  capital  works  or  debt  servicing  and \nmay be used to finance project costs.  \n \nC. \n \n30. \nA financial management assessment confirmed that the existing structure, capacity, and \narrangements of the PMOs and the PIUs are generally appropriate. However, unfamiliarity with \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nADB\u2019s financial management requirements, including disbursements, and possible insufficiency \nof counterpart funds are risk areas. The financial management risk rating is medium. An action \nplan has been agreed with the PMOs to mitigate these risks. \n \nThe city PMO will conduct all procurement and consultant recruitments under the project \n31. \non behalf of the PIUs (the PIUs will just sign the contracts). A procurement capacity assessment \nconfirmed that  the  city  PMO,  acting through  a  procurement  agency  and with the  assistance of \nADB and project management support consultants, will have adequate procurement capacity to \nfacilitate  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Specific \npolicy  requirements,  capacity  development,  and other  supplementary  measures  are  described \nin the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  HCG,  including  city  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe project area covers three counties and/or districts, 16 towns and/or townships, and \nover  136  communities  and/or  villages.  About  435,000  people  will  benefit  from  the  project,  of \nwhich an estimated 5% are poor. This project offers good opportunities for local communities to \nparticipate  in  awareness  campaigns,  environmental  improvements,  wetland  protection,  and \nsolid-waste management. The measures are included in the project design to address potential \nnegative impacts and to enhance benefits for local people, including the poor. These measures \nare summarized in the social development action plan. \n \n34.  Women  can  play  a  lead  role  in  many  activities,  such  as  greening  barren  hills,  wetland \nrehabilitation  and  protection,  and  solid-waste  management.  The  project  is  categorized  as \neffective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has been prepared. The gender action \nplan  outlines  specific  activities,  target  indicators,  responsible  agencies,  and  monitoring \nmechanisms  by  output  to  ensure  that  women  will  benefit  from  the  project.  The  key  gender \nactions  include  (i)  involving  women  in  public  awareness  campaigns,  consultation,  and \nparticipation;  (ii)  employing  local  women  during  project  construction  and  operations;  (iii) \npromoting gender awareness for project staff; and (iv) collecting gender-disaggregated data. \n \nE. \n \n35. \nEnvironment.  The  project  has  been  reclassified  from  category  A  to  category  B  for \nenvironment  since  no  irreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented  impacts  were  identified  or \nanticipated.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  follows  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EIA  is \nconsistent with the seven domestic EIAs approved by the Hebi Environment Protection Bureau. \nConsultations  involved  key  stakeholders,  including  affected  people  and  local  government \nagencies,  and  the  outcomes  are  integrated  in  the  project  design.  The  draft  EIA  was  publicly \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2015. The HCG, through the PMO, with support from \nthe  loan  implementation  environment  consultant,  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  and \nEMP compliance, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or \nmeasures.  The  PMO  will  implement  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  have  final \nresponsibility  for  handling  any  disputes.  The  PMO  has  no  prior  experience  with  ADB  projects \n\nSafeguards \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nfor \n\nincluding \n\nThe  project \n\nis  expected \n\nis  classified  category  A \n\nto  achieve  environmental  benefits, \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.

Capacity  building  and  on-site  support  by \nenvironmental, wetland, and monitoring specialists were included as part of the project design. \n \n36. \nimproved \nmanagement of a protected wetland, reduced soil erosion and discharge of untreated wastewater, \nimproved  flood  management  capacity  and  solid-waste  management,  and  adoption  of  an \nintegrated approach to water resources management. Anticipated construction impacts are from \nthe project dredging of canals (elevated turbidity, odor from dredged sediment); temporary noise \nto  water  birds  and  low  visibility  for  fish  in  the  pilot  NWP  from  project  works;  and  construction-\nrelated air, dust, vibration, soil erosion, and occupational and community health and safety issues. \nOperational  risks  include  odor  emissions  from  the  WWTPs,  release  of  treated  effluent  into \nwaterways,  and  inadequate  operation  and  maintenance  of  project facilities.  Mitigation  measures \nare described in the EMP. These include setting appropriate boundaries between WWTP facilities \nand  communities,  monitoring  water  quality,  clarifying  roles  and  responsibilities  and  operating \nbudgets, building capacity, and establishing the first management plan for the protected wetland. \nThe EIA concludes that effective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will \nresult in residual impacts within the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n37. \ninvoluntary \nresettlement. Six of the seven physical project components will cause some land acquisition and \nresettlement  (LAR)  impacts.  The  project  will  require  4,433.10  mu  of  land  to  be  permanently \noccupied  as  follows:  acquiring  1,174.23  mu  of  collectively  owned  land,  leasing  1,959.28  mu  of \ncollectively  owned 16 land,  and  occupying  1,299.59  mu  of  state-owned  land.  The  project  will \ntemporarily occupy 1,557.68 mu of land, comprising 728 mu of collectively owned land and 830 \nmu of state-owned land. In addition, 5,295 square meters of rural houses need to be demolished, \nwhich  will  require  eight  households  and  two  small  businesses  to  be  relocated.  The  project  will \npermanently affect 739 households with 3,481 people and temporarily affect 515 households with \n2,253 people. The land loss is not significant for most households because losses are scattered \nacross  70  villages  in  16  towns  or  townships.  Only  65  households  with  283  people  will  be \nsignificantly affected. The project\u2019s resettlement impacts have been adequately assessed. \n \n38. \nSix  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared.  The  plans  are  based  on  the  feasibility \nstudies,  national  and  local  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Extensive \nconsultation  was  conducted  with  the  affected  villages  and  an  engineering  design  institute  to \navoid  or  minimize  LAR  impacts.  The  proposed  compensation  and  rehabilitation  policies  are \nadequate  to  restore  incomes  and  compensate  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost.  The  affected \nvillages  are  supportive  of  the  project  as  it  will  improve  their  living  environment  and  generate \nemployment  opportunities.  The  implementing  agencies  have  made  good  arrangements  for \nresettlement  planning,  including  allocating  responsibilities  and  appointing  staff  to  implement \nLAR.  They  have  the  capacity  and  experience  to  implement  LAR  and  manage  impacts.  The \nproject will provide staff training to further strengthen the local capacity. The local governments \nhave endorsed the resettlement plans, which they have committed to implement. The grievance \nredress mechanism will be used and monitored by the PMO. The PMO will engage an external \nmonitoring and evaluation agency to monitor LAR progress and submit  semiannual monitoring \nreports. The estimated resettlement budget, including contingencies, is CNY120 million. \n \n39. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. There \nare  no  differential  impacts  to  any  ethnic  groups.  The  project  does  not  impact  any  distinct  and \n\n                                                \n16 The noncivil works of the wetland park will lease collectively owned land through a land transferring system. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nvulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nThere are no culturally related issues. \n \nF. \n \n40.
