The  project  will  result  in  annual  savings  of  1.09  million  liters  of \ndiesel consumption and annual reduction of 2,930 tons of carbon dioxide emission, for greater \nenergy security and sustainability in the Cook Islands.3 \n \n \n \nA. \n \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context and Sector Performance \n\n \n3. \nThe  Cook  Islands  is  a  Pacific  island  country  divided  into  two  island  groups  with  an \nestimated  total  population  of  18,600  people.4 The  northern  group  consists  of  seven  low-lying \nand  sparsely  populated  coral  atolls,  while  the  southern  group  consists  of  eight  fertile  volcanic \nislands. About 92% of the population lives in the southern group, which includes the main island \nof  Rarotonga.  Economic  development  is  hindered  by  the  country\u2019s  limited  size,  isolation  and \ndistance  from  markets,  lack  of  natural  resources,  periodic  devastation  from  natural  disasters, \nand inadequate infrastructure. \n \n4. \nThe Cook Islands depends heavily on imported fuels. Its total fuel import bill in 2012 was \n$29.8  million,  or  25%  of  total  imports  and  9%  of  gross  domestic  product.5 The  total  installed \npower generation capacity in the Cook Islands is 11.75 megawatts. Diesel-powered generators \nconstitute  about  99%  of  the  total  electricity  generating  capacity.  More  than  99%  of  all \nhouseholds  are  grid  connected,  5.5%  have  additional  solar  photovoltaic  home  systems,  and \n1.0% use small diesel generators.6 According to the CIRECIP, current electricity demand in the \nCook  Islands  is  about  33.0 gigawatt-hours,  and is forecast to grow  modestly  to 38.5 gigawatt-\nhours by 2020. The southern group is the dominant load center, accounting for 98% of current \nand future load demand. \n \n5. \nDelivery of energy services is undertaken by a state-owned utility on Rarotonga, and by \nisland administration committees on the other outer islands in the northern and southern groups. \nThey  are  vertically  integrated  electricity  authorities  in  charge  of  generation,  transmission, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Government of the Cook Islands. 2012.

Avarua.  \n5  According  to  the  Cook  Islands  Statistics  Bulletin  (2012),  the  country  imported  about  14.1  million  liters  of  fuel  in \n\n2012, of which 8.6 million liters were used to generate electricity. \n\n6  Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. 2012. Census of Population and Dwellings. Avarua.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndistribution,  and  retail  sales  of  electricity.  Assets  for  energy  services  are  administered  and \nmanaged by the Cook Islands Investment Corporation, the government\u2019s holding company that \ngroups the state-owned enterprises.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Challenges and Opportunities \n\n \n6. \nElectricity  costs  in the  Cook  Islands  are  among the  highest  in the  Pacific. The  reliance \non imported fuel is reflected in the high average electricity tariff charged, which was $0.63 per \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  2013.  Such  a  high  tariff  translates  into  4%  of  annual  household \nexpenditure and 15% of annual business entity expenditure. Under the regulations, the utilities \ncan  pass  on  fuel  costs  directly  to  consumers  and  charge  an  inflation-indexed  nonfuel  tariff.  In \nRarotonga, the current tariff is $0.70 per kWh. On the outer islands, due to limited affordability, \nthe  government  subsidizes  a  part  of  the  electricity  generation  cost  so  the  average  electricity \ntariff is $0.57 per kWh. Both are above regional average tariffs. \n \n7. \nVolatile  diesel  fuel  prices  and  heavy  reliance  on  imported  diesel  fuel  for  power \ngeneration significantly affects the economy and living standards in the Cook Islands. Changing \ndiesel-based power generation to renewable energy sources is expected to reduce the cost of \ngeneration by up to 40% and diesel consumption for power generation by up to 95%, and will \ncontribute to sustainable social and economic development. Average annual solar irradiation of \naround  1,900  kWh  per  square  meter  constitutes  a  major  renewable  source  for  power \ngeneration.  \n \n8. \nIn 2011, the government issued the Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart, which sets a \ntarget of supplying 50% of inhabited islands with power from renewable sources by 2015, and \n100%  of  the  inhabited  islands  by  2020. 7  It  also  launched  the  CIRECIP  in  2012,  which \nincorporates a development schedule for electricity generation from renewable sources.  \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n \n9. \nThe  government  has  a  coherent  institutional  framework  to  guide  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.  The  National  Renewable  Energy  Committee  was  formed  in  2010  to  lead  the \nrenewable  energy  project  and  ensure  timely  achievement  of  the  government\u2019s  renewable \nenergy  policy.8 A  Renewable  Energy  Development  Division  (REDD)  was  established  in  2010 \nwithin the Office of the Prime Minister and is responsible for implementing the CIRECIP. REDD \nis under the supervision and guidance of the Office of the Energy Commissioner (OEC), which \nis responsible for energy sector planning and management, including electricity tariff regulation \nand standardization of electricity services.  \n \n\n \nRationale for Sector Loan Modality and ADB Intervention \n\n4. \n\n \n10. \nThe Cook Islands has a clearly articulated renewable energy sector development plan in \nthe  CIRECIP.  However,  developing  grid-connected  renewable  energy  systems  on  all  islands \nwithin  the  next  6  years  requires  strengthened  and  comprehensive  project  management  and \ninstitutional  capacity.  The  CIRECIP  proposes  a  wide  range  of  renewable  energy  systems  for \n12 geographically  scattered  islands  in  the  northern  and  southern  groups  according  to  their \n\n                                                \n7  Government of the Cook Islands. 2011. The Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart. Avarua.  \n8   It  is  comprised  of  the  minister  in  charge  of  renewable  energy,  OEC,  REDD,  Te  Aponga  Uira  (TAU),  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure  and  Planning,  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation,  and  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nManagement (MFEM).  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ntechnical  and  administrative  complexity \n\nresource  endowments,  load  demand,  and  grid  conditions  for  stable  electricity  supply.  The \nCIRECIP  also  proposes  mitigating \nthrough \ncomprehensive  institutional  strengthening  in  load  management  and  grid  protection,  demand-\nside energy efficiency, and private sector participation.  \n \n11. \nTo minimize complexity in project management and support CIRECIP implementation in \na phased manner, the project will finance a time and area slice of the development plan. It will \nsupport  solar  photovoltaic  power  development  and  implementation  in  the  southern  group  over \n3 years. Combined with ongoing assistance by New Zealand for the northern group (para. 13), \nthe project will help achieve renewable energy system deployment on about 80% of islands by \n2017.  It  will  also  provide  project  management  support  and  capacity  building  for  design, \nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  and  help  facilitate  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance  demand-side  energy  efficiency,  and  update  the  CIRECIP  for  further \nrenewable energy deployment by 2020. \n \n12. \nThe Energy Policy (2009) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports the rationale \nof  the  proposed  project  by  promoting  deployment  of  clean  energy  in  its  developing  member \ncountries. 9 Development  of  energy  and  infrastructure  are  a  main  component  of  the  Pacific \nApproach  2010\u22122014. 10  The  project  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan, \n2014\u22122016,  which  includes  energy  as  a  priority  area  of  support  and  sets  a  primary  goal  of \nreducing  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuels  by  generating  power  from  its  own \nrenewable  energy  sources. 11  The  sector  loan  approach  is  appropriate  because  it  allows \nflexibility  in  subproject  development,  and  capacity  development  to  roll  out  renewable  energy \ndeployment  on  all  islands;  and  the  Cook  Islands  has  a  sound  sector  development  policy, \ninstitutional capacity, and appropriate policies.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\n \nNew  Zealand  started  solar  photovoltaic  power  system  development  in  the  northern \n13. \ngroup  of  islands  in  2012,  and  on  Rarotonga  in  2014.  ADB,  New  Zealand,  and  the  European \nUnion  have  coordinated  closely  to  support  implementation  of  the  CIRECIP  by  developing  a \ncommon technical standard for grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems, sharing lessons and \nissues related to engineering design and project implementation; and sharing a project steering \ngroup. The proposed project will complement these efforts.12 \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  energy  security  in  an  environmentally \nsustainable  manner.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  a  higher  share  of  electricity \ngenerated by renewable energy sources.  \n \nC. \n \n15. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have two outputs: \n(i) \n\nSolar  photovoltaic  power  system  development.  The project will construct up \nto  six  solar  photovoltaic  power  plants  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of  about \n\n                                                \n9   ADB. 2009.

The project will feature three core subprojects on Mangaia, Mauke, \nand Mitiaro and up to three noncore subprojects on Aitutaki, Atiu, and Rarotonga. \nCore  subprojects  are  already  designed,  assessed  as  viable,  and  ready  for \nimplementation.  These  three  will  be  implemented  first.  Noncore  subprojects \nrequire additional resources for further due diligence and final design after project \napproval. They will be implemented sequentially.  \n\nInstitutional strengthening and project management support. The project will \nprovide  institutional  strengthening  to  OEC  and  REDD  to  develop  the  energy \nefficiency  policy  implementation  plan  including  an  energy  audit  and  monitoring \nscheme  to  enhance  demand-side  energy  efficiency  practices  for  targeted  major \nelectricity consumer groups;13 develop the capacity to assess renewable energy \ntechnologies and set appropriate off-take tariffs for power purchase agreements \nin projects funded by the private sector; and update the CIRECIP by reexamining \nthe electricity load demand up to 2020, the renewable technology choices, and a \nleast-cost investment plan. The consultants to be engaged under this component \nwill  be  the  project  owner\u2019s  engineer  (POE)  team,  who  will  also  provide  project \nmanagement  support  for  REDD  and  Te  Aponga  Uira  (TAU)  to  help  implement \nthe project. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n16. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $24.28 million (Table 1). \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nInstitutional strengthening and project management support  \nLand acquisition \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

Solar photovoltaic \n24. \npower plants with lithium-ion batteries for energy storage have been assessed as the least-cost \ntechnology  in view  of  available renewable resources,  necessary  capital  and operational  costs, \npower  output  stability,  and  environmental  impacts.  The  system  configuration  design  of  core \nsubprojects  has  been  carefully  analyzed  considering  the  assessed  solar  irradiation,  load \ndemand curve, grid conditions, hard marine environments, and extreme weather events such as \ncyclones.  These  core  subprojects  will  include  remote  control,  monitoring,  and  protection \nsystems  to  stabilize  the  grid  in  line  with  international  design  standards.  The  turnkey \ncontractor(s) will provide specialized O&M knowledge transfer to ensure sustainable operation. \n \n\n25. \nThe power outputs from the three core subprojects will be synchronized and integrated \ninto the existing electricity grid using lithium-ion battery storage to make up for the  intermittent \nnature of solar energy and ensure electricity supply even during the night. This will help make \nthe electricity system sustainable, stable, and reliable, allowing it to supply clean electricity and \nmeet more than 90% of electricity load demand. The three noncore subprojects will be prudently \nprepared  based  on  the  system  configuration  design  and  lessons  from  implementation  of  the \nthree core subprojects. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nFinancial analysis. The project financial analysis quantifies costs and benefits for each \n26. \ncore  subprojects.  Project  financial  costs  include  (the  initial  capital  costs  of  solar  photovoltaic \npower  system  development,  including  power  grid  refurbishments;  annual  and  periodic  O&M \nexpenditures;  and  consulting  services  required  for  design  review,  tender  assistance,  project \nsupervision, and training. The financial costs exclude price contingencies. A financial appraisal \nof the three core subprojects was undertaken using with- and without-project scenarios over a \n25-year  operational  period.  Revenue  is  derived  from  the  levelized  cost  of  electricity  under  the \nwith-project  scenario  and  derived  from  the  existing  tariff  under  the  without-  project  scenario.19 \nThe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  Mangaia,  Mauke,  and  Mitiaro  subprojects  are \nestimated to be 6%, 9%, and 7%. This compares favorably with the estimated weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  5.02%,  indicating  that  the  project  is  financially  viable.  The  sensitivity  tests \nshowed robust results for all adverse scenarios, with financial internal rates of return exceeding \nthe weighted average cost of capital.20  \n \n27. \nEconomic  analysis.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the three core subprojects \nby  comparing  the  discounted  costs  and  benefits  under  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios \nover 2014\u20132042 in constant 2014 prices. The without-project case represents a continuation of \nthe existing situation, and the with-project case represents the project investment scenario. The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  for  Mangaia,  Mauke,  and  Mitiaro  are  estimated  to  be  13%, \n14%,  and  14%.  They  compare  favorably  with  the  12%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital, \nindicating  that  the  project  is  economically  viable.  Under  the  same  scenarios  considered  in  the \nfinancial analysis, the economic internal rate of return remains robust.21 \n \n                                                \n19 The  average  levelized  cost  of  electricity  for  core  subprojects  is  estimated  at  $0.45,  while  the  average  prevailing \n\ntariff is at $0.65. \n\n20  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nFinancial  management.  To  ease  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nexecuting  agency  will  approve  and  submit  to  ADB  withdrawal  applications  from  the  project \nmanagement unit, assisted by POE, for direct payment for most project goods, works, services, \nand  the  consultancy  component  of  the  turnkey  contractor(s).  Disbursements  of  grant  funds \nunder  the  project  will  be  to  procure  goods,  works,  services,  and  the  related  consultancy \ncomponent  of  the  turnkey  contractor.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  MFEM,  REDD, \nand  TAU\u2019s  internal  controls  and  accounting  and  audit  procedures  was  undertaken.  Their \nfinancial  management  practices  and  procedures  are  considered  to  be  adequate  if  assisted  by \nPOE and the overall risk rating was assessed as moderate. The project management unit to be \nestablished  will  comprise  POE,  REDD,  and  TAU,  and  will  be  responsible  for  project  financial \nmanagement and accounting. The government and TAU\u2019s accounts and reporting structures are \nbased on New Zealand\u2019s generally accepted accounting standards.  \n \n29. \nProcurement  capacity  assessments  for  MFEM,  REDD,  and  TAU  were  also  conducted \nand  overall  risk  ratings  were  average.  MFEM,  REDD,  and  TAU  have  experienced  and  trained \npersonnel  in  procurement  and  contract  management  supported  by  well-established  internal \nprocedures  and  management  systems,  which  are  consistent  with  ADB  requirements.  The \naccountability  mechanism  is  also  deemed  effective  for  procurement  and  contract  awards, \ndisbursement,  and  internal  audit.  However,  both  REDD  and  TAU  lack  experience  in \nprocurement  with \nthis  capacity  gap, \nprocurement  training  seminars  were  provided through project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(footnote  3).The  POE,  which  should  have  extensive  experience  with  ADB-financed \ninfrastructure projects, will help conduct procurement in line with ADB guidelines. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government  and TAU. The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nare described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD. \n\ninstitutions.  To  overcome \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ninternational \n\nfinancing \n\nThe  project  will  improve  access  to  more  affordable  power  supply,  and  will  also  widen \n31. \naccess to better social services and income-generating opportunities. It will contribute to poverty \nalleviation indirectly by reducing the country\u2019s reliance on volatile and costly imported fossil fuels \nfor  power  generation.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  the  participation  of  youth,  vulnerable \npeople,  and  women\u2019s  groups  in  all  project  consultations,  and  employment  opportunities  for \nthese groups. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for \nenvironment following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An environmental assessment \nand review framework has been prepared for noncore subprojects, and an initial environmental \nexamination has been prepared for core subprojects. The main environmental impacts will occur \nduring  site  preparation,  which  will  include  the  cutting  of  about  140  trees  and  clearing  of \nvegetative cover from the proposed sites and surrounding areas to prevent shading. There will \nbe impacts from noise and dust due to transportation of plants and materials, and operation of \nconstruction machinery. These impacts will be short-term (about 1 week for the smaller plants, \nand up to 1 month for the larger plants). Operational impacts include maintenance of the plant \nand  management  of  used  batteries.  It  is  proposed,  as  a  special  condition  in  the  technical \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \n\nspecifications,  that  suppliers  handle  and  dispose  used  batteries.  The  solar  photovoltaic  power \nsystem will not have any significant long-term environmental impacts.  \n\n33. \nDuring  implementation,  MFEM,  REDD,  and  TAU,  with  support  from  the  environmental \nexpert  under  the  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management  support  component,  will \nprepare  the  initial  environmental  examination  for  noncore  subprojects  and  update  the  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  and  the  environmental  management  plans  based  on  the  detailed \ndesigns  for  core  and  noncore  subprojects.  ADB  will  clear  the  updated  documents.  The \nenvironmental management plans from the updated assessments will be integrated into the bid \nand  contract  documents.  During  project  implementation,  the  environment  expert  will  enhance \nthe capacity of MFEM, REDD, and TAU in safeguard implementation and monitoring. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement (category  B). The project has been classified as category B \n34. \nfor involuntary resettlement. It is not expected to involve physical displacement. Impacts are not \nsignificant, but will arise from the minor acquisition of land with some trees. A resettlement plan \nhas been prepared for the three core subprojects. A resettlement framework has been prepared \nfor  the  project  with  guidelines  to  prepare  resettlement  plans  for  noncore  subprojects.  Affected \ncommunities  have  been  consulted  during  project  preparation,  and  the  resettlement  framework \nand plan have been posted on ADB\u2019s website. The resettlement plan will be updated after the \ndetailed design, and compensation will be provided to affected persons before civil works start \non the respective sites. The Cook Islands Investment Corporation and Crown Law Office have \nexperience  in  acquiring  land  and  they  will  support  MFEM,  REDD,  and  TAU  in  updating  and \nimplementing the resettlement plan. The project will recruit social safeguard specialist to boost \nthe capacity of government agencies for managing land acquisition and safeguards.     \n \n35. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  has  been  classified  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The population in the project area comprises the mainstream population of \nthe  Cook  Islands.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  group  of \nindigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.22 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nSupport, performance, and \ncoordination at REDD and TAU \ncould be inadequate. \n\nImplementation could be delayed \ndue to delays in noncore \nsubproject preparation, land \nacquisition, and procurement.  \n\nGovernment and development \npartner support to implement \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nAdequate project management assistance provided by the \ninstitutional strengthening and project management support \ncomponent. \n \nPreparation of noncore subprojects will be supported under \ninstitutional strengthening and project management support.
