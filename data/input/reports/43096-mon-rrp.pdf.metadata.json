The report includes a proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for  Strategic  Capacity  Development \nfor  Social  Sectors  from  the  TA  Special  Fund  in  the  amount  of \n$700,000.  \n \nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-M) \nSector:  Multisector  \u2013  health  and  social  protection  (health  finance); \neducation \n(education  sector  development);  and  urban  sector \ndevelopment \nThemes:  Social  development  (other  vulnerable  groups),  gender \nequity (gender equity in empowerments and rights) \nLocation impact: National (medium) \nPartnership: Japan International Cooperation Agency \n \nCategory  C.

The \nfinancial  crisis  by \nProgram  will  protect \nimplementing  a  set  of  policy  measures  in  the  social  welfare,  health, \nand  education  sectors  to  provide  essential  social  services,  and  to \ninitiate  longer-term  reforms  to  improve  the  targeting  of  social \nassistance and living conditions of the poor, especially in ger areas of \nUlaanbaatar. \n \nThe global financial and economic crisis has had immediate and very \nnegative  fiscal  and  economic  consequences  for  Mongolia  and \ncompromises  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  sustain  high  social \nspending. The current crisis comes close on the heels of high inflation \nand  severe  increases  in  food  prices  in  2008,  which  have  weakened \nthe coping capacity of many households in Mongolia, especially those \nof the poor. With one-third of Mongolia\u2019s population living in poverty, \nunless the Government is able to bring about an orderly adjustment to \nthe  social  consequences  will  be  severe, \nthis  external  shock, \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nimprove \n\npotentially  unwinding  the  gains  of  recent  years  and  threatening  the \nattainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  In  close \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners  and  donors,  the \nProgram  will  help  the  Government  to  limit  social  sector  expenditure \ncuts in 2009 and 2010. Lessons from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial \ncrises  provide  clear  evidence  of  the  importance  of  protecting \nexpenditures, in particular for nutrition and health outcomes. Through \nspecific  short-term  policy  measures,  the  Program  will  also  help  to \nreduce out-of-pocket expenditures of poor households for health care \nand increase micronutrient consumption. At the same time, the policy \nmeasures  will \nlong-term  sustainability  of  social \nexpenditures  through  better  targeting  and  rationalization  of  social \ntransfers  in  the  health,  health  insurance,  education,  and  social \nwelfare sectors.  \n \nAbout 22% of Mongolia's poor are concentrated in Ulaanbaatar. The \npresent crisis provides opportunity to ensure long-term improvements \nto the living conditions in poor ger areas around the capital city. The \nProgram  directly  supports  government  plans  to  mitigate  the  effect  of \nthe crisis on the poor and supports the country partnership strategy's \nfocus on inclusive social development. The Program is in line with the \ndevelopment  agenda  of  inclusive  economic  growth  in  ADB\u2019s  long-\nterm  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  and  ADB's \nglobal  economic  crisis  response  strategy  of  striving  to  rebalance \neconomies and provide support to the poor. \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  to  ensure  that  the  poverty  levels \nand  per  capita  consumption  of  the  poor  do  not  deteriorate  after  the \nimplementation of the Government's economic stabilization program. \nThe outcome of the Program will be assured funding of priority basic \nservices  in  2010\u20132011  and  the  initiation  of  reforms  to  increase  the \nefficiency of social welfare spending and improve living conditions of \nthe poor. The effect of the economic crisis on the poor is mitigated in \nthe  short  term  by  ensuring  pro-poor  funding  of  priority  programs  for \nbasic  services  and  in  the  long-term  by  initiating  reforms  to  increase \nthe  efficiency  of  social  welfare  assistance  and  improve  living \nconditions of the poor. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government by providing a loan \nin  various  currencies  equivalent \nto  Special  Drawing  Rights \n28,129,000 ($43.1 million) and a grant of $16.9 million to support the \ncountry's  economic  stabilization  program.  The  Program  will  be \ncofinanced  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA), \nunder  a  parallel  cofinancing  arrangement,  for  an  amount  of  $50 \nmillion. \n \nThe  implementation  period  of  the  Program  is  21  months.  It  will  be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2010.  ADB  and  JICA  have  prepared  a \njoint  policy  matrix.  The  Program  amount  will  be  released  in  two \ntranches upon compliance with relevant tranche release conditions.  \n \n \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nProgram Loan and \nGrant Amount \n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\n\fExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\nto  verify \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  serve  as  the  Executing  Agency \nand  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the \nProgram. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL); Ministry \nof  Health  (MOH);  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Sciences \n(MOECS); Ministry of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban \nDevelopment  (MRTCUD);  and  the  Ulaanbaatar  Municipal  Office  will \nserve  as  the  implementing  agencies.  The  MOF  will  establish  a \nprogram  steering  committee  (PSC)  to  be  chaired  by  the  state \nsecretary  of  the  MOF.  The  members  of  the  PSC  will  be  senior \nrepresentatives of the implementing agencies. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  and  procurement \nprocedure  for  program  loans,  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  may  be \nutilized  to  procure  goods  and  services  (excluding  local  duties  and \ntaxes) produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other \nthan  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items,  those  financed  by \nother multilateral and bilateral official sources, and imports from non-\nADB member countries. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \nloan  and  grant  proceeds  and \nthe \nGovernment  certification.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the \naccompanying  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  accompanying  TA  will  require  a  total  of  19  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  46  person-months  of  national \nconsultants to support the outlined activities. \n \nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  support  the  country's  economic \nstabilization  program.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has \nestimated that Mongolia will need $284 million of external financing in \n2009  and  $153  million  in  2010.  The  IMF  stand-by  arrangement  will \nprovide  $139  million  in  2009  and  $93  million  in  2010.  The  ADB \nprogram support will provide $60 million in 2009, the Government of \nJapan through JICA will provide $30 million in 2009 and $20 million in \n2010,  and  the  World  Bank  will  provide  $40  million  in  2009  and  $20 \nmillion in 2010. These combined disbursements will cover most of the \nfinancing shortfall, with a gap of $15 million in 2009 and $20 million in \n2010  which  the  Government  envisages  covering  through  assistance \nfrom other donors. \n \nThe key benefits and beneficiaries of the Program are as follows. \n \nBeneficiaries  and  Fiscal  Sustainability.  By  strengthening  and \nreforming  social  welfare  systems,  and  especially  by  improving \ntargeting,  the  Program  will  improve  the  performance  and  fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  Government.  By  converting  the  child  money \nprogram  into  a  targeted  benefit,  the  IMF  estimates  that  MNT61,033 \nmillion  (about  $43  million)  could  be  saved.  By  targeting  other  social \nbenefits more efficiently, another MNT12,206 million could be saved. \nWith  these  savings,  equivalent  to  1.16%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  in  2009,  the  Government  will  be  able  to  increase  the  benefit \nlevels  for  the  poorest  households  without  creating  an  unsustainable \n\n       iii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfiscal  burden.  Fiscal  sustainability  will  provide  a  basis  for  sound \neconomic  recovery,  and  thereby  diminish  the  burden  on  the  state  to \nprovide for the unemployed and other groups made vulnerable by the \nfinancial crisis.  \n \nConsolidation  of  Welfare  Benefit.  The  Program  will  significantly \nimprove  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  Government  to  consolidate \nand  target  social  welfare  benefits.  Key  to  this  is  the  creation  of  the \ncabinet-level  working  group  and  the  related  working  groups  at \nministerial  level.  The  Program  will  improve  the  policy  framework  to \nconsolidate social transfers and will therefore facilitate the objectives \nof the ongoing Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Project to rationalize \nsocial welfare.  \n \nPaving  the  Way  for  Associated  Projects.  The  policy  measures  to \ntarget social welfare benefits will pave the way for associated projects \nin  health  (the  medicard  program  and  household  micronutrients)  and \neducation  (school  textbooks).  These  projects  will  help  very  poor \nhouseholds  meet  their  basic  needs  during  the  financial  crisis.  The \nProgram  will  also  build  on  the  Food  and  Nutrition  Social  Welfare \nProgram  and  Project  to  extend  the  proxy  means  test  (PMT)  to  the \nhealth and education sectors so that these benefits are well targeted. \n \nHarmonization  of  Development  Efforts. Program interventions are \nharmonized  with  international  efforts  (e.g.,  those  by  the  IMF,  JICA, \nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and  the  World  Bank), \nand  the  Government\u2019s  broader  plans  and  programs  (e.g.,  social \nwelfare reform) and will therefore directly benefit the Government by \npreventing  duplication  of  effort  and  ensuring  the  efficiency  of  social \nwelfare programs and targeting in health and education. \n \nImproved  Government  Capacity. The reform measures emphasize \nimproving  the  capacities  of  the  Government  to  deliver  consolidated \nand  targeted  welfare  assistance.  The  capacity  provided  through  an \naccompanying TA project will pave the way for a nationwide PMT, the \nresults  of  which  will  enable  Government  to  establish  and  manage  a \nunified  social  security  database  that  serves  the  needs  of  many \nsectors.  Capacity  building  for  urban  planning  will  focus  on  ensuring \nthat  expertise \nto  build  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards into planning exercises. \n \nInstitutional  Impact.  Government  institutions  particularly  MSWL, \nMOH,  and  MOECS,  will  be  better  able  to  reform  themselves  and  to \ndeliver social welfare services. The unified database will create a tool \nthat different sectors can use to target their services to meet the basic \nneeds of the population. \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  Mongolia\u2019s  social  welfare  system  has  had  a \nlimited  impact  on  poverty  reduction  because  of  its  poor  targeting. \nUnder the Program, benefits will be consolidated and targeting will be \ngreatly improved, resulting in significant cost savings. This will create \nan  opportunity  to  increase  the  size  of  key  benefits  thereby  helping \n\nis  available \n\n\f \nRisks and Mitigation  The major risks and mitigation measures are as follows. \n\nhouseholds  in  the  lowest  quintile,  many  of  whom  depend  on  such \nbenefits.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  achieved  by  ensuring  greater \navailability  of  essential  drugs  in  primary  health  care  and  outpatient \nfacilities. Out-of-pocket expenses will decline and fewer poor patients \nwill require hospitalization. With regard to nutrition, the measures will \nhelp malnourished children receive critical micronutrients in their own \nhomes. \n \nGender Benefits. Social welfare reforms will have consequences for \nvirtually  all  citizens,  male  and  female.  More  women  than  men  use \nprimary health care facilities, and girls have higher school and tertiary \neducation enrollment than boys. Efforts will be made to address these \ndisparities in the reform and targeting programs. A gender action plan \nhas  been  prepared  with  the  goal  of  maximizing  opportunities  for \ngender impact in design and implementation and providing adequate \ndata for monitoring and evaluating the Program. \n \n\ntherefore \n\n \nHigh  Expectations.  The  universalization  of  previously  targeted \nwelfare  benefits  was  based  on  promises  made  during  election \ncampaigns.  From  July  2006,  at  a  time  of  rapid  economic  growth,  all \nhouseholds  with  children  under  18  years  became  accustomed  to \nreceiving  cash  grants.  The  Government  may \nface \nopposition when it reverts to targeted child benefits. There is a lack of \nconsensus  on  this  issue  in  the  government  and  promises  of  large \nunconditional  cash  grants  of  over  MNT1  million  for  each  Mongolian \nmade  by  candidates  in  the  recently  concluded  presidential  elections \nmay  increase  public  opposition  to a  shift  toward  targeted conditional \ntransfers. This risk will be mitigated through an intense education and \nconsensus  building  initiative  targeting  members  of  parliament,  the \nmedia, civil servants, and the public. This will be done through the TA \nattached to the Program. \n \nDeepening Macroeconomic Instability. If the Government is unable \nto implement the economic stabilization program agreed with the IMF \nor if the global economy does not recover over the medium term, the \nmacroeconomic situation could deteriorate, with negative implications \nfor  the  social  sectors.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  continuous \nhigh-level policy dialogue by ADB and other major donors. \n \nOveroptimistic  Expectations  of  Recovery.  The  price  of  copper  is \nvolatile. Sudden increases (such as that in mid-April 2009) can easily \nbe misinterpreted as a sign of economic recovery. Targeting may be \nopposed in the expectation that small increases in minerals prices will \nbe  sustained  and  that  the  economy  will  recover.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  by  advocacy  work  conducted  by  the  accompanying  TA \nproject.  This  will  aim  to  raise  awareness  among  parliamentarians  of \nthe  need  for  targeting  to  maintain  long-term  fiscal  stability  and \nsavings.  The  policy  dialogue  that  is  part  of  IMF  quarterly  macro \nassessment  under  the  IMF  stand-by  arrangement  will  also  help  to \nmaintain the commitment of the Government to reform targeting. \n\n       v \n\n \n\n\fin  Establishing \n\n \nthe  National  Database  of  Poor \nDelays \nHouseholds.  It  will  take  time  for  the  new  PMT  national  database  to \nfunction  efficiently.  This  might  increase  the  reluctance  of  MOECS, \nMOH,  and  MSWL  to  adopt  the  PMT.  Likewise,  it  might  increase  the \nreluctance of the Parliament to approve a comprehensive overhaul of \nthe  social  welfare  system  and  introduce  and  reform  targeting  in \nhealth,  health  insurance,  and  education.  This  could  also  delay  the \nimplementation  of  the  medicard  program.  Therefore,  a  transition \nstrategy  will  be  adopted,  which  will  help  to  improve  targeting  (e.g. \nthrough  the  creation  of  a  list  of  people  who  do  not  need  social \nassistance)  until  the  PMT  and  the  national  database  becomes \navailable.  The  transition  strategy  will  be  part  of  the  plan  to  reform \nsocial welfare. The accompanying TA together with the ongoing Food \nand  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Project  will  accelerate  the  development \nof the PMT through specific activities geared at field testing the PMT, \ncollecting  information  on  households,  and  designing  the  national \ndatabase of poor households. \n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nMONGOLIA\nSOCIAL SECTORS SUPPORT PROGRAM\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaanbayshint\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nTsagaannuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\nSelenge\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nHOVD\n\nUyench\n\nYarantay\n\nTayshir\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBaganuur\n\nBatnorov\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nLun\nZuunmod\nTOV\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nArvayheer\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nChoyr\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n9\n-\n1\n7\n5\n3\n \nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to Mongolia for the Social Sectors Support Program.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT AND ITS SOCIAL IMPACT \n\n2. \nSince  its  transition  from  socialism  in  1992,  Mongolia  has  made  significant  economic \nprogress.  Fundamental  economic  reforms  have  been  undertaken  in  price  liberalization  giving \nMongolia  one  of  the  least  restrictive  trade  regimes  in  Asia,  and  a  relatively  liberal  foreign \ninvestment  environment.  The  country\u2019s  vast  mineral  resources,  notably  copper,  have  attracted \nsignificant direct foreign investment. Mongolia has held a series of free and fair elections. A new \ncoalition  government  was  formed  following  short-lived  political  disturbances  after  the  June  2008 \nparliamentary elections. \n \n3. \nThe economic reforms, and a buoyant world economy, put Mongolia\u2019s economy on a strong \ngrowth  trajectory  well  into  2008.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  an  estimated  8.9%  in \n2008,  down  from  the  previous  year\u2019s  double-digit  rate  but  close  to  the  average  of  the  previous  5 \nyears. Agriculture, which supports about 40% of the population, grew by 5.0%, aided by favorable \nweather and fiscal incentives to produce wheat. Services output climbed by 15.9% and growth in \nbanking  services  was  spurred  by  double-digit  expansion  in  real  estate,  retail  trade,  and \ncommunications.  Above  all,  mining  expanded  with  the  price  of  copper  reaching  a  record  high  of \n$8,700  per  ton  in  April  2008,  contributing  to  about  one  third  of  Government  revenue,  primarily \nthrough increased windfall taxes. \n \nThe economic boom allowed the Government to grant large wage increases and untargeted \n4. \nsocial  transfers,  which  rose  with  the  increased  revenue.  Although  growth  was  widespread, \nMongolia remained highly dependent on mining, leaving it vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity \nprices.  \n \n5. \nThe price of copper fell by 60% to $3,500 per ton in March 2009 because of rapidly falling \ndemand.  This  had  immediate  and  very  negative  consequences  for  the  fiscal  account,  the  real \neconomy, the balance of payments, the exchange rate, and the Government\u2019s capacity to sustain \nprovision  of  universal  social  transfers.1 With  one  third  of  Mongolia\u2019s  population  living  in  poverty, \nunless  the  Government  is  able  to  execute  an  orderly  adjustment  to  this  external  shock,  the \nresulting social consequences will be severe, potentially unwinding the gains of recent years. \n \nThe financial crisis comes in the wake of severe spikes in food and oil prices in 2008.2 The \n6. \ninflation  rate  reached  33%  in  May  2008,  much  higher  than  in  most  other  Asian  countries.3 The \nprices of wheat (primarily imported) and meat (domestically produced) contributed to nearly half of \n\n                                                 \n1  The price of copper has since increased but demand remains volatile due to the weak global economy. \n2   Palanivel,  T.  2008.  Policy  Note  on  the  Soaring  of  Food  and  Oil  Prices  in  Mongolia:  Causes,  Consequences  and \nResponses  at  the  Macro  Level.  Colombo:  United  Nations  Development  Program/Regional  Center  in  Colombo \n(UNDP/RCC).  \n\n3   Inflation  reached  an  11-year  high  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (8.7%  in  February  2008),  a  9-year  high  in  the \nRepublic of Korea (5.5% in June 2008), a 26-year high in Singapore (7.6% in April 2008), and a 12-year high in Viet \nNam (25.2% in May 2008). \n\n \n\n\f2       \n\nthe overall inflation,4 with oil prices accounting for a small but growing proportion. The inflation was \ndue partly to an overheated domestic economy and rising global food and fuel prices although the \nprovision of untargeted social benefits and rising wages also played a key role.  \n \n7. \nGovernment revenue has fallen sharply. The International Monetary fund (IMF) predicts that \nexport proceeds will fall by more than one third to $800 million. While revenue, as a share of GDP, \nis at 2005 levels, government spending is almost one-third higher than it was then, fueled in part by \ndistribution of universal social benefits. Since the third quarter of 2008, the current account balance \nhas  deteriorated  further  because  of  dramatic  declines  in  export  revenues  from  minerals  and \nagricultural products.  \n \n8. \nThe  IMF  predicts  that  the  current  account  deficit  will  be  about  6.5%  of  GDP  in  2009, \nseriously hampering the Government\u2019s capacity to maintain social services, and that GDP growth \nwill  drop  to  2.75%.  The  decline  is  increasingly  worrying  since  the  fall  in  exports  and  investment \nflows  into  the  mining  sector  has  spread  to  a  slowdown  in  domestic  demand  as  credit  flows  have \ndried up and a freeze has been imposed on public sector employment. Higher unemployment will \nreduce tax income and income to the national Health Insurance Fund. The current financial crisis \nexposes vulnerabilities in Government revenue sources and social assistance policies. However, it \nalso  presents  an  opportunity  to  improve  targeting  for  the  poor  and  to  strengthen  the  fiscal \nsustainability  of  social  assistance.  More  information  on  the  macroeconomic  context  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n9. \nSocial  Impact  of  the  Crisis.  Mongolia  is  among  the  29%  of  all  developing  countries \ncategorized by the World Bank as \"highly exposed\" to the poverty effects of the crisis. This is due, \nin  part,  to  a  reliance  on  the  volatile  mining  revenue  for  the  Government  budget  and  a  large \npercentage  of  the  poor.5 In  2007\u20132008,  some  35.2%  of  the  population  was  classified  as  poor.6 \nProgress in reducing poverty is threatened by the evolving economic crisis. Pressure on spending \nfor  essential  services  and  social  welfare  will  have  a  particular  impact  on  the  poor,  who  rely  on \naffordable access to social assistance as a basic coping strategy, especially in times of economic \nstress. \n \n10. \nIn  recent  years,  urbanization  and  changing  livelihoods  have  resulted  in  new  vulnerable \npopulations.  The  current  crisis  comes  on  the  heels  of  the  massive  spikes  in  inflation  in  2008 \n(particularly  for  food  items)  provoked  by  the  global  food  crisis.  Social  analysis  carried  out  in \npreparation  for  the  Food  and  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Program  and  Project  (FNSWPP) 7 \ndemonstrated that the poor were directly affected by rising prices and immediately cut back on the \nquality  and  amount  of  food  consumption,  and  reduced  or  eliminated  expenditures  for  health, \neducation,  transport,  and  energy.  Evidence  from  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis  clearly \ndemonstrates  that  social  sectors,  if  not  strongly  protected,  will  weaken  during  a  crisis,  with  long-\nterm deficits in health and education being particularly detrimental to younger generations.  \n \nThe  Mongolia  Country  Poverty  Assessment 8  highlights  several  important  dynamics  of \n11. \npoverty that will directly affect how the financial crisis will impact the poor. These include: (i) rising \ninequality  (the  overall  strong  growth  has  not  translated  into  poverty  reduction); 9 (ii)  worsening \n                                                 \n4  This is because food prices increased (on a year-on-year basis) the most in 2008: 59% in May 2008 and 57% in June \n2008, compared with about 7% during the corresponding months in 2007. Wheat prices have increased by 47% and \nmeat products by 49% since the beginning of 2008. \n\n5  World Bank. 2009. Financial Crisis Could Trap 53 Million More People in Poverty.

This is based on an agreed budget deficit of \n6% for 2009 and 4% for 2010, with the corresponding fiscal gap estimated at $144 million for 2009 \nand  $60  million  for  2010.  The  economic  program  is  built  on  four  main  planks:  (i)  adjusting  the \nbudget  for  2009  and  2010  to  put  Mongolia's  public  finances  in  order  and  restore  the  deficit  to  a \nsustainable range, and to strengthen the institutional framework for fiscal policy; (ii) implementing a \npro-active monetary policy that will seek to safeguard international reserves; (iii) ensuring that the \npoorest  segments  of  society  are  protected  through  a  comprehensive  overhaul  of  social  transfer \nprograms,  improving  targeting  and  raising  the  level  of  social  support  to  the  very  poor;  and  (iv) \nstrengthening the banking system by improving the current framework for deposit guarantees and \nenhancing bank supervision.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n13. \nThe increase in poverty as a result of the current financial crisis will depend on the length \nand depth of the crisis. The 1997 Asian financial crisis led to large increases in unemployment and \npoverty, which triggered a deterioration in education and health outcomes. When poverty rises and \npublic  finances  are  tight,  there  is  a  greater  likelihood  of  higher  infant  mortality,  child  malnutrition, \nand  school  dropout  rates.  The  situation  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis  eventually  stabilized  only \nafter  massive  government  intervention.  Cash  transfers  played  a  critical  role  in  alleviating  poverty \nwhile  education,  nutrition,  and  health  care  programs  helped  contain  long-term  adverse  effects.13 \nThis  key  lesson  has  been  applied  in  the  design  of  the  proposed  Program.  The  problem  tree \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n14. \nThe Program will support the Government\u2019s fiscal adjustment and, at the same time, protect \nthe basic needs of the poor by implementing policy reforms in the social sectors. During the current \nfinancial  crisis,  the  growing  number  of  poor  will  find  it  increasingly  difficult  to  meet  such  basic \nneeds  as  food  consumption,  access  to  health  care,  access  to  education,  and  decent  living \nconditions. The 1997 Asian financial crisis showed that it is essential for Government to maintain \nthe critical services that sustain these basic needs. In the face of mounting budget cuts, this can be \nachieved  by:  (i)  targeting  benefits  at  the  poor;  (ii)  consolidating  social  transfer  programs  to  make \nthem more  efficient and cost effective; and (iii) implementing policy reforms that will increase the \npoor's  access  to  health  and  nutrition  services,  health  insurance,  and  education.  This  section \nsummarizes the issues facing the three key ministries mandated to provide for the basic needs of \n\n                                                 \n10 The poor and near-poor rely on welfare benefits and particularly the CMP to meet basic needs and day-to-day survival. \nThe poor in both urban and rural areas often literally live on their future benefits\u2013pawning their benefit booklets at local \nstores  to  purchase  foodstuffs  credited  to  their  future  benefits.  Any  change  to  the  social  welfare  system  will  have  to \nacknowledge this aspect of \"living in the future.\" \n\n11 Lack  of  civil  registration  and  limited  benefits  for  drug  coverage  and  tests  for  outpatients  results  in  significant  out-of-\n\npocket expenses for the poor. \n\n12 Rapid urban growth primarily in ger areas combined with insufficient attention to pro-poor urban development has led \n\nto sustained lack of basic services such as water and sanitation. \n\n13 UNICEF.  2008.  Economic  Crisis  and  Its  Social  Impact:  Lessons  from  the  1997  Asian  Economic  Crisis.  New  York \n\n(prepared for UNICEF conference in Singapore, 6\u20137 January 2009). \n\n \n\n\f4       \n\nthe  poor\u2014the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor;  the  Ministry  of  Health;  and  the  Ministry  of \nEducation,  Culture,  and  Science\u2014in  view  of  the  significant  budget  cuts  they  now  face.  It  also \ndiscusses  the  issues  facing  the  urban  poor  and  their  access  to  services  in  light  of  the  financial \ncrisis and budget reduction.  \n \nSocial Welfare Sector. The Government adopted a social security sector strategy paper in \n15. \n2003 to rationalize the scope of social welfare services and improve cost efficiency. Based on this, \nin 2005, the Government introduced the CMP, and the first social welfare assistance programs to \nuse a proxy means test (PMT) to target poor households. However, in May 2006, Parliament made \nthe  CMP  a  universal  entitlement  for  all  children  below  18  years  of  age  and  provided  other  new \nbenefits for newlyweds and mothers. This raised two immediate concerns: (i) making the benefits \nuniversal was not consistent with the Government's commitment to implement targeted support for \nthe poor, and (ii) the fiscal sustainability of such welfare measures was unclear.  \n \nSocial transfers rose sharply from 2006 to 2008. With the universalization of the CMP, the \n16. \nnumber of social welfare beneficiaries soared from 160,000 in 2004 to more than 1 million in 2006. \nThe increases were not related to poverty incidence, but to the interplay of political pressures and \nthe universal coverage of social cash transfers. One of the Government\u2019s immediate responses to \nthe 2008 food crisis was again to increase welfare benefits by a further 20% in January 2008. The \nescalations in expenditures up to 2009 and the creation of an entitlement system now present the \nGovernment  with  the  challenge  of  cutting  back  entitlements  to  restore  fiscal  sustainability.  More \nnon-poor than poor use social welfare services: 70% of social welfare beneficiaries are considered \nnon-poor.14 \n \n17. \nTargeted  support  for  food  consumption  by  the  poor  is  being  addressed  through  a \nGovernment-funded  food  stamp  program  to  address  the  severe  food  price  inflation  in  2008.  The \nprogram is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) FNSWPP. The food stamp program \nwill be implemented until at least December 2011. \n \nBudget Cuts in Social Welfare. The 2009 amended budget for social welfare services has \n18. \nbeen reduced by MNT78.4 billion, a decrease of 18.6% from the 2009 approved budget. Recurrent \nexpenditures  declined  significantly  (nearly  20%  of  the  cuts  have  been  to  the  administrative  and \noperational costs of the ministry). The amended budget shows that the largest cuts will be made to \n\u201cgoods  and  services.\u201d  The  capital  budget  will  be  cut  by  11.5%.  For  the  programs  that  are  strictly \ntargeted at the poor and vulnerable, there has been either no decrease or small cuts. The following \nuniversal  programs  will  be  cut:  (i)  the  pregnant/feeding  mother\u2019s  benefit  by  12.8%,  (ii)  the \nnewlywed program by 38%, and (iii) the CMP by 35%. \n \n19. \nA planned across-the-board cut in the CMP will affect the poor disproportionately as many \nare  almost  entirely  dependent  on  these  payments  for  their  daily  subsistence.  The  current  crisis \nenvironment  provides  an  opportunity  to  reform  the  social  assistance  system  from  an  entitlement-\nbased  sytem  to  a  needs-based  system.  Targeting  needs  to  be  introduced  so  that:  (i)  non-poor \nhouseholds can be removed from this list, (ii) benefits can be increased to those who remain, and \n(iii) unreached poor can be included (it is estimated that 40% of the poorest households and 25% \nin the poorest quintile, receive no social assistance at all) (footnote 14). \n \n20. \nThe  CMP  is  the  largest  social  benefits  program,  so  rationalizing  it  would  provide  the \ngreatest potential for savings. The upper two quintiles consist of approximately 1.2 million people. \nAssuming 70% of those individuals (the non-poor that are awarded social benefits) receive benefits \nat an average of MNT136,000 per year, eliminating them would yield a savings of MNT59 billion. \n\n                                                 \n14 World Bank, 2009. Consolidating the Gains, Managing Booms and Busts, and Moving to Better Service Delivery \u2013 A \n\nPublic Expenditure and Financial Management Review. Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\f5        \n\nBy converting the CMP into a targeted benefit, the IMF estimates that MNT61,033 million could be \nsaved.  By  targeting  other  social  benefits  more  efficiently  another  MNT12,206  million  could  be \nsaved.15 With  these  savings,  the  Government  could  increase  benefit  levels  for  the  poor,  improve \ntargeting methodologies, and monitoring. The overall impact on the budget is expected to remain \nneutral, or possibly positive.  \n \n21. \nHealth  Sector.  The  Government  aims  to  make  services  accessible  through  a  variety  of \nmeasures, including free access to primary health care and essential public health services, such \nas  maternity  care,  treatment  of  communicable  diseases,  and  emergency  services.  Historically, \nMongolia has had relatively high levels of health expenditure, equivalent to 3.2% of GDP and 10% \nof  overall  government  expenditures  in  2008  (footnote  14).  However,  allocation  of  government \nexpenditures  has  been  heavily  oriented  toward  the  secondary  and  tertiary  levels,  with  referral \nhospitals providing a large proportion of outpatient services and managing many cases that could \nbe  dealt  with  at  primary  level.  An  estimated  40%  of  all  hospital  admissions  are  thought  to  be \nclinically unnecessary. A key reason for this is the poor availability of subsidized essential drugs at \nprimary  health  care  and  hospital  outpatient  facilities.  Because  hospitalized  patients  receive  free \ndrugs (along with other services) there is an incentive for people to by-pass the primary health care \nlevels. Further, when patients at the primary level are unable to afford prescribed non-subsidized \ndrugs, their condition may deteriorate, resulting in hospitalization that could have been prevented if \nthe drugs were more easily available. \n \nTo improve access, a universal and compulsory health insurance scheme was introduced in \n22. \n1995. This currently accounts for about 25% of overall Government health expenditures. The state \nsubsidy  for  health  insurance  does  not  adequately  serve  the  needs  of  the  poor.  This  is  because \nstate  contributions  are  based  on  categories  of  people  (such  as  children  under  16,  soldiers,  and \nstudents),  not  on  levels  of  poverty.  As  a  result,  many  non-poor  are  included,  and many  poor  are \nexcluded.  Another  reason  relates  to  civil  registration;  many  categories  of  the  poor,  such  as \nunregistered  migrants,  street  children  and  the  homeless,  are  unregistered  and,  consequently, \ncannot obtain health insurance. \n \n23. \nHealth Budget Cuts. The Mongolian Parliament amended the 2009 budget in March 2009. \nThe  health  sector  budget  was  cut  from  MNT229.6  billion  to  MNT206.8  billion,  a  10.2%  reduction \nthat  affected  both  recurrent  costs  and  capital  investments.  In  the  recurrent  costs  section  of  the \nbudget, this cut has primarily affected salaries and wages, which have been cut by 9.25%; heating, \nelectricity, stationery, fuel and transportation, which have been cut by 17.3%; and medicines and \nvaccines  which  have  been  cut  by  20%.  Funding  has  been  decreased  for  all  health  centers  and \nhospitals. Salaries for family group practices (FGPs) have also been cut by MNT103.66 million. \n \n24. \nAccess to health care by the very poor and vulnerable especially in the rural and urban ger \ncommunities may be significantly affected by the erosion of the quantity and quality of the health \ncare  caused  by  budget  cuts  to  facilities  in  these  areas.  Out-of-pocket  expenses  will  increase  as \nfunding cuts affect the delivery of essential health services at the soum  health center (SHC) and \nFGP levels since these services depend on the provision of capitation-based funding provided by \nthe state budget. While funding from the Health Insurance Fund has not been reduced, declines in \nthe state budget will affect the SHCs and FGPs which are primarily used by the poor.  \n \n25. \nEducation  Sector.  Mongolia  is  highly  ranked  in  terms  of  education  expenditures, \nenrolment,  and  completion.  However,  poverty  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  school  attendance \n\n                                                 \n15 IMF. 2009. Mongolia Public  Expenditure Review, Ulaanbaatar. The elimination of  universal  benefits to those  who  do \nnot  depend  on  them  for  well-being  provides  an  additional  avenue  for  potential  savings.  Under  the  current  Social \nWelfare  Law  of  2006,  the  Mongolian  government  awards  four  different  types  of  universal  benefits  to  citizens;  Child \nMoney,  the  Newlywed  benefit,  Newborn  benefit,  and  the  benefit  given  to  pregnant  women.  In  2008,  these  benefits \namounted to MNT147,970 million.   \n\n \n\n\f6       \n\nand  school  quality.  Even  before  the  financial  crisis,  the  costs  of  education  to  parents,  including \ntextbooks, stationery, school uniforms, and travel to school were major concerns. Surveys showed \nthat  textbooks  were  the  highest  expenditure  item  in  household  spending  on  education.  For  the \npoorest  segment  of  the  population,  textbook  costs  account  for  over  50%  of  educational \nexpenditures.  In  theory,  the  Government  provides  textbooks  to  20%  of  the  students  who  are \ndeemed  poor.  However,  the  existing  targeting  program  is  administered  inefficiently  as  there  is \nleakage  to  the  non-poor  and  coverage  is  low,  with  only  9%  of  the  students  reporting  having \nreceived free textbooks. \n \nEducation  Budget  Cuts.  The  education  budget  has  been  reduced  by  MNT46.975  billion \n26. \n(10.8%) compared with the 2009 budget. Even before the financial crisis, there were funding gaps, \nand  it  is  anticipated  that  these  will  increase  during  the  crisis.  The  2009  approved  budget  for  the \nministry  was  MNT432  billion 16 but  this  has  been  decreased  to  MNT386  billion;  a  reduction  of \nMNT46  billion,  affecting  both  recurrent  costs  and  capital  investments. 17 In  the  recurrent  costs \nsegment of the budget, cuts have primarily affected salaries and wages and related expenditures, \nwhich  have  been  reduced  by  9.1%.  Other  cuts  are  for  line  items  such  as  stationery,  electricity, \nheating,  and  transportation,  which  have  been  cut  by  22.3%.  Budget  cuts  will  result  in  re-phasing \nthe  construction  of  schools,  dormitories,  and  kindergartens.  The  crisis  will  severely  curtail  the \nexpansion plans for primary schools.  \n \n27. \nThe ongoing economic crisis and budget cuts threaten the achievement of education goals. \nThe immediate concerns are increases in: (i) unemployment and consequent decreases in income \nfor parents and guardians; (ii) the number of parents unable to afford school textbooks; (iii) school \ndrop-out  rates  and  the  number  of  out-of-school  children,  especially  within  poor  communities;  (iv) \nchild labor, due to falling household incomes, further increasing the school drop-out rate; and (v) \nurban  migration,  resulting  in  more  urban  schools  having  to  work  in  shifts  to  accommodate  rising \nnumbers of students.  \n \n28. \nUrban Sector. The population of Ulaanbaatar City is growing rapidly and is now 40% of the \nnational total. Much of this growth has taken place in  ger districts in an ad hoc fashion and as a \nresult,  roads,  utilities,  and  other  infrastructure  in  these  areas  are  inadequate.  The  populations  of \nthe ger districts are predominantly poor, with living standards and access to basic services such as \nwater and sanitation very unsatisfactory. The provision of basic services is exacerbated by the ad \nhoc  pattern  of  settlement,  rapid  increases  in  population  and  outdated  legislative  frameworks. \nPiecemeal  measures  to  develop  the  ger  areas  are  costly  and  have  not  resulted  in  adequate \nimprovements in living standards. \n \nUnless  a  proper  plan  is  developed  and  implemented,  urban  sprawl  and  uncontrolled \n29. \ndevelopment will continue to take place. Given the weak legislative framework on land ownership \nand  management,  further  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  development  would  not  only  diminish  the \naesthetics  of  the  city  and  reduce  the  potential  for  economic  growth,  it  would  also  reduce  living \nstandards. The poor in the ger districts would be worse off because of the deterioration in services \nand lack of economic opportunities. Taking social and environmental considerations into account in \nthe planning process will be the key to a harmonious improvement in living conditions, especially \nfor the poor living in poor ger areas. A detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 MOECS. 2009. Proposal on Budget Support in Response to Financial Crisis in Education. Ulaanbaatar. \n17 2009 Amended Budget for Mongolia, Ministry of Finance. \n\n \n\n\f7        \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\n30. \nOverreliance  on  Mineral  Revenue  as  a  Funding  Source  for  Social  Assistance. \nMongolia  has  relied  on  mining  as  a  source  of  expanding  government  revenue  and,  for  several \nyears, the sector delivered beyond expectations. Windfall taxes enabled the Government to invest \nin  development  activities  and  fulfill  election  promises,  including  universalizing  child  benefits. \nHowever, reliance on mineral revenue, as a primary funding for social welfare benefits such as the \nCMP is affected by fluctuating mineral prices and therefore needs to be minimized. \n \n31. \nLack  of  Targeting  in  Current  Social  Programs.  The  lack  of  poverty  targeting  in  social \nwelfare  assistance  programs  results  in  large  inclusion  and  exclusion  errors.  About  two-thirds  of \nsocial assistance goes to the non-poor at enormous cost to the Government. A significant portion \nof poor households are excluded from the government assistance. A unified approach to targeting \nacross sectors, using a common data base of poor households, would improve the pro-poor focus, \nimpact and efficiency of current social transfers.  \n \n32. \nFragmented  Social  Welfare  Transfers. Social assistance includes 48 programs and 156 \ndifferent  types  of  social  services.  In  many  cases,  programs  overlap.  The  absence  of  an  effective \ncentrally  operated  management  information  system  leads  to  duplication  of  benefits  and  other \ninefficiencies.  Unless  the  fragmentation  of  the  social  assistance  system  is  addressed,  it  will  be \ndifficult  to  make  it  more  efficient.  The  fragmentation  also  means  that  numerous  types  of \nbeneficiaries (e.g., the elderly, disabled, newly wed, and care-givers) may resist any consolidation \nprocess.  Consolidation  has  only  recently  become  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  on  reforming  social \nwelfare so advocacy and effective public communication will be needed. \n \n33. \nCreating  Additional  Benefits.  In  recent  elections  the  Government  promised  that  up  to \nMNT1.5 million from the revenues of the mining sector would be given out to all Mongolians as a \n\u201cmotherland  benefit.\u201d  The  purpose  of  this  benefit  is  to  share  the  profits  of  the  mineral  wealth \ndirectly  with  all  citizens,  but  its  feasibility  will  need  to  be  reconsidered  in  light  of  the  current \neconomic and financial situation. \n \nLack of Impact Measurement and Inadequate Monitoring and Evaluation. Inadequate \n34. \nmonitoring and evaluation systems and impact measurement mean that the Government has only \na  limited  understanding  of  the  impact  of  welfare  programs.  For  example,  at  present  there  is  no \ncentral database of CMP beneficiaries which hampers efforts to reduce coverage for those who do \nnot need such assistance. \n \n35. \nLimited  Access  to  Social  Assistance.  The  complexities  of  the  civil  registration  system \nlimit the access of poor households to social assistance, particularly those households who have \nrecently  moved  to  urban  areas,  but  have  lost  documents  or  have  other  difficulties  with  the \nregistration system. The social welfare system currently relies on self-registration for benefits and \nhas no outreach programs to reach those without proper civil registration. \n \nPoverty and Inequality. One of the key findings of the recent poverty data (2007\u20132008) is \n36. \nthe growth in inequality. The strong growth of the past few years has not transferred benefits to the \nbroader  population,  especially  the  poor.  The  financial  crises  may  exacerbate  growing  inequality \nand  undermine  Mongolia\u2019s  progress  towards  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs). Unless mitigation measures are put in place, rising unemployment will swell the ranks of \nthe poor and push up social welfare expenditure, even with good targeting systems in place. \n \n\n \n\n\f8       \n\n37. \nProxy  Means  Test  Development  and  Need  for  a  Transition  Strategy.  Mongolia  has \nexperience of successful proxy means testing under the initial targeted CMP program in 2005. It is \nimportant to underline that the changes to universal coverage were prompted by access to mining \nrevenue  and  political  promises,  not  because  of  the  failure  of  the  original  CMP  to  target  those  in \nneed.  \n \n38. \nDuring  the  development  of  the  FNSWPP  in  2008,  broad  consensus  was  reached  with \nstakeholders on the need to target the new form of social assistance. Re-development of the PMT \nwas envisioned in one of the pilots to be implemented in 2009. In response to the financial crisis \nand the needs outlined and agreed upon in the Program policy matrix, this process is now being \nfast-tracked. The World Bank has agreed to carry out the new PMT calculations and estimations \nbased  on  poverty  data  from  the  household  socioeconomic  survey  2007\u20132008.  This  work  will  be \ncarried  out  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  (MSWL)  and  National \nStatistics Office (NSO). The MSWL has created a working group on PMT development and is also \nthe  coordinating  agency  for  an  intersectoral  working  group  on  the  same  topic.  The  new  PMT \nestimations and questionnaire are expected in June 2009. It is estimated that full national coverage \nof  the  PMT  will  take  8-12  months.  Many  of  the  poor  can  be  covered  quickly  by  using  available \npoverty  mapping  data  developed  under  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP) \nassistance. Initial pilot testing of the tools will be carried out under the FNSWPP. Rapid validation \nwill be conducted by a nongovernment organization or university contracted for such purpose.  \n \nGiven  the  time  needed  to  design  and  implement  the  PMT,  it  is  clear  that  a  transition \n39. \nstrategy  is  needed.  An  MSWL  social  welfare  plan  is  required  under  the  IMF  agreement  and  is  a \nfirst tranche condition of the Program. The plan will analyze the options and outline the transition \nstrategy including using available databases and documentation to create a list of people who can \nbe taken off the list of CMP beneficiaries. This would include civil servants, employees in the formal \nsector, and others for whom the assistance is not absolutely necessary. Working from both sides of \nthe beneficiary list at the same time (i.e., identifying those who need to be on the list via PMT and \nthose  who  can  safely  be  excluded  through  existing  databases),  the  MSWL  will  develop  a  list  of \npoor in need of social assistance within a reasonable timeframe and without undue social shocks.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\nQuick  Response  to  Immediate  Budget  Support  Need.  The  Government  has  taken \n40. \nprompt  action  to  steer  the  country  back  to  recovery.  This  rapid  response  by  Government  and \nsupport from its development partners provide a firm footing for recovery.  \n \nCreating  a  National  System  of  Targeting  the  Poor.  The  Government  has  accepted  a \n41. \nrange  of  policy  measures  that  will  create  a  solid  foundation  for  a  national  system  that  supports \npoverty targeting across sectors over the long term. This will ensure that those most in need are \nbeneficiaries of Government programs aimed at reducing poverty in the country. \n \n42. \nGrowing Appreciation of the Need for Targeting. The current financial crisis has created \na  realization  that  fiscal  sustainability  is  critical  and  that  universal  benefits  are  likely  to  undermine \nthis. There is growing awareness of the need to prioritize beneficiaries and put in place adequate \nidentification  and  monitoring  systems.  These  systems  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  social \nassistance programs and will operate across sectors. \n \n43. \nImproving  Efficiency  of  Social  Transfers.  The  policy  measures  proposed  are  budget \nneutral. They are intended to help the Government address basic needs more efficiently, including \nhealth, education, welfare, and urban living conditions. \n \n\n \n\n\f9        \n\n3. \n\nLessons \n\n44. \nNeed  to  Manage  Reluctance  to  Implement  Targeting.  Reforms  to  improve  targeting  of \nsocial  welfare  programs  will  be  limited  by  public  sensitivities,  popular  expectations,  and  political \ndemands.  Reluctance  to  undertake  targeting  can  also  partly  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of capacity, \nknowledge of targeting mechanisms, and identification of workable models. Although the financial \ncrisis has highlighted the need for targeting, broad support for such a change will still have to be \ngained from politicians and the wider public. \n \nUnregistered  Households  Need  to  Be  Brought  into  the  System.  The  exclusion  of \n45. \nhouseholds from social welfare benefits because they have not managed to register under the civil \nregistration system needs to be addressed as a matter of  urgency as many of these households \nare very poor. Several programs are updating the civil registration records. Any program designed \nto address database management of social assistance will need to integrate these new resources \nand procedures.  \n \n46. \nLessons from Support for Social Sectors During Financial Crises. During crises, falling \ndemand  for  exports,  declining  investments,  and  lower  remittances  have  an  economy-wide, \nsystemic impact that is difficult to counter, even with sufficient reserves. This is particularly true in \nMongolia,  where  economic  diversification  is  limited.  World  Bank  research  on  financial  crises 18 \nsuggests that poverty is very likely to rise and that a deep and prolonged financial crisis is likely to \nhave very negative consequences on human development. The distributional effects are complex \nand  not  easy  to  predict  as  they  vary  according  to  geographic  location,  household  demographics, \neducation,  and  assets.  Because  financial  crises  have  economy-wide  impacts,  the  poor's  coping \nstrategies  are  likely  to  fail  as  a  result  of  across-the-board  declines  in  credit  opportunities  and  a \ngeneral weakening of mutual insurance arrangements. \n \n47. \nBroad government and political efforts to protect the poor during a financial crisis are critical \nto the success and sustainability of interventions, especially when targeting is called for (footnote \n18). Policy choices are usually constrained by the crisis itself, with fiscal demands limiting choices. \nThis is especially the case in Mongolia, which has failed to build up the fiscal reserves required to \ncounter the impacts of a serious economic decline. In countries where aggregate public spending \nis  reduced  during  a  crisis,  direct  assistance  to  households,  combined  with  budgetary  support  for \nselected social expenditures during economic downturns, is effective. Protection of expenditures is \nparticularly important for nutrition and health outcomes, especially for children under 24 months of \nage, and pregnant and lactating women. \n \nLessons  from  ADB's  Responses  to  the  Financial  Crisis. A recent evaluation of ADB\u2019s \n48. \nresponse  to  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis19 identifies  lessons  relevant  for  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  crisis  responses.  Support  for  policy  measures  and/or  investment  components \naimed  at  maintaining  access  of  the  poor  to  social  services  (mainly  health  and  education)  and \nmaintaining  the  quality  of  such  services  was  more  relevant  and  effective  than  implementation  of \nlonger-term  general  health  and  education  sector  reforms.  The  use  of  established  programs  or \nuncomplicated  delivery  channels  was  a  factor  in  successful  responses,  ensuring  timeliness  and \nlimiting  the  burden  on  local  institutions.  Donor  coordination  was  recognized  as  difficult  but \nconsidered vital for crisis support. During crisis situations, effective coordination among multilateral \nfinancial institutions and transparent sharing of information are needed to ensure that external aid \nprograms are consistent and comprehensive and do not overlap or work at cross-purposes.  \n\n                                                 \n18 World  Bank  Development  Research  Group.  2008.  Lessons  from  World  Bank  Research  on  Financial  Crises.  Policy \n\nResearch Working Paper 4779. Washington, DC.  \n\n19 ADB.  2009.  Lessons  from  Asian  Development  Bank's  Responses  to  Financial  Crisis.  Manila  (Evaluation  Information \n\nBrief). \n\n \n\n\f10       \n\n49. \nGiven  the  gravity  of  the  current  crisis  and  its  impact  on  poverty  levels  and  gender-based \nvulnerabilities, there is an urgent need to maintain and even increase social expenditure, including \nan expansion of social safety nets. This will protect the poor and vulnerable, such as low-income \nwomen  workers.  Social  expenditure  will  also  redistribute  income,  with  positive  implications  for \nreducing  gender  gaps, and  stimulate  internal demand  and  national  growth.  Early  trends  in global \nunemployment  rates  indicate  that  women  are  being  hit  hard,  as  some  of  the  industries  most \naffected include garments, textiles, and electronics, which have predominantly female workforces. \nLow-income  women  workers,  with  limited  savings,  are  likely  to  be  hit  the  hardest.  Initiatives  to \nstrengthen social transfer systems need to take gender dimensions into account.20 \n \n50. \nLessons  from  ADB  Policy-Based  Lending.  Key  findings  from  the  ADB  Independent \nEvaluation  Department  (IED)  2001  special  evaluation  study  on  program  lending21 identified  the \nneed  for:  (i)  adequate  policy  analysis  as  the  basis  for  policy  dialogue,  (ii)  gauging  and  building \ngovernment  commitment,  and  (iii)  a  realistic  policy  framework  and  matrix  incorporating  a \nmanageable approach to conditions for loans. Overly complex and ambitious reforms and complex \ndesigns with too many tranche release conditions detract from successful implementation. A 2007 \nIED evaluation update on policy-based lending22 confirmed the relevance of many of the findings of \nthe  2001  evaluation.  Mongolia's  track  record  in  implementing  policy-based  lending  programs  is \nconsidered  acceptable.  The  cancellation  of  the  third  tranche  of  the  Social  Security  Sectors \nDevelopment  Program23 was  not  linked  to  the  factors  listed  above  but  resulted  from  changing \nframework conditions and priorities over time. \n \n51. \nRationale  for  the  Program.  Mongolia's  high  vulnerability  to  the  global  financial  and \neconomic  crisis  has  immediate  and  very  negative  fiscal  and  economic  consequences  and \ncompromises the Government\u2019s capacity to sustain high social spending. The current crisis comes \non the heels of high inflation and severe increases in food prices in 2008, which have weakened \nthe  coping  capacity  of  many  households  especially  of  the  poor.  With  one-third  of  Mongolia\u2019s \npopulation living in poverty, unless the Government is able to bring about an orderly adjustment to \nthis  external  shock,  the  resulting  social  consequences  will  be  severe,  potentially  unwinding  the \ngains of recent years and threatening the attainment of the MDGs. Working in close coordination \nwith other financiers, the Program will help to reduce Mongolia's fiscal gap, thereby limiting social \nsector  expenditure  cuts  in  2009  and  2010.  Lessons  from  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis \nprovide clear evidence of the importance of protecting expenditures, in particular for nutrition and \nhealth. Through specific short-term policy measures, the Program will also help to reduce out-of-\npocket  expenditures  of  poor  households  for  health  care  and  increase  micronutrient  consumption. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  policy  measures  will  improve  the  long-term  sustainability  of  social \nexpenditures  through  better  targeting  and  rationalization  of  social  transfers  in  the  health,  health \ninsurance, education and social welfare sectors. About 22% of Mongolia's poor are concentrated in \nUlaanbaatar.  The  present  crisis  is  also  an  opportunity  to  ensure  a  strong  basis  for improving  the \nliving  conditions  in  poor  ger  areas  around  Ulaanbaatar  in  the  long  term.  The  Program  directly \nsupports Government plans to mitigate the effect of the crisis on the poor and supports the country \npartnership strategy pillar of inclusive social development (in preparation). The Program is in line \nwith the development agenda of inclusive economic growth in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2009.

The  outcome  of  the  Program  will  be  assured  funding  of  priority  basic \nservices  in  2010\u20132011  and  the  initiation  of  reforms  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  social  welfare \nspending and improve living conditions of the poor.  \n \nThe  Program  will  support  the  fiscal  adjustment  needed  for  Mongolia's  economic \n53. \nstabilization program. It will help to ensure that the budget for social sectors expenditures remains \nadequate  in  the  short  term.  The  Program  will  protect  the  poor  during  the  financial  crisis  by \nimplementing a set of policy measures in social welfare, health, and education to provide essential \nsocial services, and initiate longer-term reforms to improve the targeting of social assistance and \nliving conditions of the poor, especially in ger areas of Ulaanbaatar. The Program will ensure that \nGovernment per capita funding for FGPs and SHCs and the benefit level of the CMP for the lowest \nsocioeconomic  quintile  are  maintained  at  their  2008  levels,  as  the  benefits  of  these  measures \naccrue disproportionately to the poor.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nTwelve policy reform areas have been agreed with the Government. The first is a general \n54. \ncondition, linked to Government\u2019s arrangement with the IMF, on the implementation of a successful \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  program.  The  IMF  program  focuses  on  three  key  areas  of \nmacroeconomic  adjustment  during  the  crisis  period.  Fiscal  adjustment  is  primarily  centered  on \nexpenditure  restraint  and  the  overhaul  of  the  social  transfer  system.  To  maintain  fiscal  discipline \nand to prevent past pro-cyclical fiscal policies, a draft Fiscal Responsibility Law is to be submitted \nto  Parliament  by  the  end  of  2009.  Exchange  rate  and  monetary  policy  will  be  used  to  build \ninternational  reserves  at  the  Central  Bank  and  to  maintain  sufficiently  tight  monetary  policy  to \nmanage  the  exchange  rate  and  inflation.  The  fixed  exchange  rate  has  now  become  a  managed \nfloating  rate.  The  third  area  is  restoring  confidence  in  the  banking  system  by  strengthening  the \ndeposit  guarantee  system,  improving  banking  supervision  to  address  potential  weaknesses  in \nbanks, and enacting a revised banking law to this effect by end of June 2009. \n \n55. \nThe other 11 policy reform areas are grouped under: social welfare, health, education, and \nurban  development.  The  release  of  program  funds  will  be  in  two  tranches,  triggered  by  specific \nreform measures implemented by the Government of Mongolia. ADB and the Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  have  prepared  a  joint  policy  matrix  (Appendix  3).  The  following \nsections  summarize  the  key  features  of  the  agreed  matrix.  A  detailed  description  of  each  policy \nreform area and measure is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2008.

The goal of this measure is social welfare reform to improve efficiency \nand protect the poor through (i) better targeting (through PMT); (ii) consolidation of social welfare \nprograms, including the CMP; and (iii) achievement of fiscal sustainability. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst  tranche  policy  measures. Through the MSWL, the Government will prepare \na  plan  to  reform  social  welfare,  which  improves  targeting  through  PMT  and \nconsolidates  social  welfare  programs.  The  plan  will  incorporate  (a)  institutional \nchanges; (b) a plan of action for implementation, including a transition strategy; (c) \noptions  for  addressing  the  challenges;  (d)  stakeholders'  responsibilities;  and  (e) \nfunding.  \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  The  Cabinet  will  submit  to  the  Parliament  a \ntargeted  and  consolidated  social  welfare  program.  Further,  the  Parliament  will \napprove  a  2010  budget  that  includes  financing  for  a  targeted  and  consolidated \nsocial welfare system. Measures to be considered when determining whether such \na plan has been met include: (a) a maximum of about 10 social welfare benefits will \nhave  been  regrouped  in  three  to  four  programs  to  target  the  elderly,  disabled, \nchildren,  and  poor  households;  (b)  former  universal  programs  will  have  been  cut \nentirely or targeted through PMT (or through the transition strategy until the PMT is \nfinalized);  and  (c)  sources  of  funding  will  have  been  identified  and  included  in  the \nbudget proposal submitted to Parliament.  \n\n \nIn its negotiations with the IMF, the Government has agreed to reform the system of social \n57. \ntransfers, notably to end the universal child grants which have been provided since June 2006, and \nto now target these towards households that need them most, and to consolidate programs. The \nreforms will have far-reaching implications for the MSWL, which is responsible for social welfare, \nsocial insurance, and employment issues at the central level.26 The Government has placed a high \npriority  on  the  implementation  of  social  welfare  reform,  creating  a  cabinet-level  working  group \n(CWG),  including  representatives  of  the  MSWL,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science \n(MOECS), and the Ministry of Health (MOH), chaired by the First Deputy Prime Minister. The CWG \nwill  take  overall  responsibility  for  governmental  guidance  of  the  social  welfare  reform  process, \nfocusing on the overall design and framework. A key task of the CWG is to consider how best to \nconsolidate  the  current  48  social  welfare  programs  and  benefits.  The  CWG  will  also  guide  the \nprocess  of  preparing  new  legislation  to  accommodate  the  reform  measures.  Under  the  CWG,  a \nnumber of other working groups will then be established with the participating ministries focusing \non specific issues such as PMT.  \n \n\nb. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 3: Drug Discount System  \n\n58. \nPolicy Framework. The aim of this measure is to reduce hospital admissions by expanding \nthe  drug  discount  system  under  the  state  health  insurance  scheme.  Overall,  the  measure  is \ndesigned to streamline state health insurance benefits to make them more accessible to users of \nprimary health providers, especially the poor.   \n \n\n(i) \n\nFirst tranche policy measures. Through the MSWL, the Government will have: (a) \nundertaken  a  critical  assessment  of  the  existing  drug  discount  system,  (b) \nestablished  a  working  group  on  improving  the  discount  system,  and  (c)  finalized \nguidelines on the expanded discount system. \n\n                                                 \n26 This was established by a law passed by Parliament in 1993. \n\n \n\n\f13        \n\n(ii) \n\nSecond tranche policy measures. Through the MSWL, the Government will have: \n(a)  approved  an  improved  drug  discount  system  based  on  the  results  of  the \nassessment, and (b) pilot-tested key aspects of the system. \n\n \n59. \nThe  Government  aims  to  make  services  accessible  through  a  variety  of  measures, \nincluding free access to primary health care and essential public health services and the national \nHealth  Insurance  Fund.  The  fund  has  had  difficulty  in  adequately  covering  basic  drugs  at  the \nprimary  level,  which  has  had  a  disproportionate  impact  on  its  poorer  members.  A  key  factor \ncontributing to this situation is the poor availability of subsidized essential drugs at primary health \ncare  and  outpatient  facilities.  As  a  result  of  the  agreed  policy  measures,  the  Government  will  be \nable  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  existing  drug  discount  benefits  of  the  Health \nInsurance  Fund.  All  stakeholders,  including  members,  pharmacies,  drug  prescribers  (e.g.,  FGPs, \nSHCs) and the Social Security Insurance General Office will be involved.  \n \n\nc. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 4: Health Insurance \n\n60. \nPolicy  Framework.  This  measure  will  help  target  subsidies  for  state  health  insurance \ncontributions  through  PMT.  It  aims  to  (i)  improve  accessibility  of  health  services  provided  to  the \npoor, and (ii) improve the satisfaction of the insured through more efficient and effective use of the \nstate\u2019s limited contribution to the Health Insurance Fund.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst tranche policy measures. To trigger the first tranche, through the MSWL, the \nGovernment  will  have  established  a  working  group  to  target  health  insurance \nsubsidies. The focus of the working group\u2019s efforts will be the revision of the Health \nInsurance Law. \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  To  trigger  the  second  tranche,  through  the \nMSWL,  the  Government  will  have:  (a)  finalized  the  action  plan  for  implementing \ntargeted  health  insurance  subsidies,  and  (b)  prepared  a  draft  amendment  to  the \nHealth Insurance Law. \n\n \n61. \nThis  policy  measure  aims  to  address  fundamental  weaknesses  in  the  Mongolia  national \nhealth  insurance  system.  Currently,  health  insurance  coverage  does  not  reach  20%  of  the \npopulation, many of whom are poor. About half of the population, including non-poor households, \nreceives  a  subsidy  that  could  be  better  directed  to  the  poor.  The  per  capita  state  subsidy  to  the \nfund is too small to cover the real costs of in-patient hospital care and does not adequately serve \nthe needs of the poor.27 State contributions are based on categories of people (such as the aged), \nnot  on  levels  of  poverty.  This  approach  results  in  many  non-poor  being  included  and  many  poor \nbeing  excluded  from  the  system.  Unregistered  households,  most  of  whom  are  poor,  are \nsystematically  excluded.  This  policy  measure  will  pave  the way  for  the  Health  Insurance  Fund  to \nbetter serve the health needs of the poor by using targeting methods, such as PMT.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n27 Social Security Insurance General Office. 2009.

This  measure  will  result  in  the  establishment  of  an  Emergency \nMechanism  to  ensure  the  supply  of  essential  vaccines,  medicines,  and  other  medical  supplies  in \ncase of acute shortages.28  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst tranche policy measures. Through the MOH, the Government will establish a \nworking group on an Emergency Mechanism. \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  MOH,  the  Government  will \nestablish  the  Emergency  Mechanism.  It  will  (a)  identify  funding,  and  (b)  make \nguidelines available. \n\n \n63. \nThis  policy  measure  is  designed  to  ring-fence  the  existing  budget  within  the  MOH  and  to \nestablish  procedures  so  that  essential  vaccines,  medicines  and  other  medical  supplies  can  be \nquickly  procured  in  case  the  financial  crisis  further  deteriorates  and  national  stocks  run \ndangerously low.  \n\nb. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 6: Expanding the Coverage of Household \nMicronutrients Fortification \n\nPolicy  Framework.  The  overall  objective  is  protection  of  children  against  malnutrition  by \n\n64. \nexpanding the coverage of household micronutrient fortification to targeted areas.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst tranche policy measures. Through the MOH, the Government will establish a \nworking  group  on  micronutrients  expansion.  This  working  group  will  finalize  the \nexpansion plan, which will include targeting measures.  \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  MOH,  the  Government  will \napprove the expansion of the coverage of the household nutrient fortification. \n\n \n65. \nProvision  of  the  micronutrients  will  be  undertaken  with  support  from  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction  (JFPR).29 Providing  household-based  micronutrients  through  food  fortification \nand  improving  complementary  feeding  practices  of  parents  and  caregivers  will  reduce  persistent \nchronic malnutrition in children.  \n \n\nc. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 7: Medicard Program for the Poor \n\n66. \nPolicy Framework. This measure will introduce a medicard program for the poor at primary \nhealth care centers and hospitals. It will pave the way for a reduction in out-of-pocket health care \nexpenses for the poor.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst  tranche  policy  measures.  Through \nGovernment will establish a joint MOH and MSWL medicard working group. \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.    Through  the  MOH,  the  Government  will \napprove  the  introduction  of  a  medicard  for  the  poor,  based  on  either  PMT  or  a \n\nthe  MOH  and \n\nthe  MSWL, \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n28 The Emergency Mechanism is defined as a set of MOH procedures to enable essential vaccines, medicines and other \nmedical  supplies  to  be  quickly  procured  in  the  event  of  the  financial  crisis  further  deteriorating  and  national  stocks \nrunning dangerously low. The MOF clarified that procurement through direct contracting and purchasing can be used \nin the context of the Emergency Mechanism.

It  will  also  finalize  the  action  plan  on  the \nimplementation of the medicard.  \n\n \n\n67. \nThe  poor  make  less  use  of  most  types  of  health  care  services  than  other  groups,  mainly \nbecause of problems of accessibility and cost. The utilization rate of inpatient services by very poor \nhousehold  members  is  2.5  times  lower  than  that  of  the  non-poor  households.  The  policy  of  the \nGovernment  on  free  primary  care  for  the  poor  is  not  working  adequately  in  practice,  as  the  poor \nface relatively high out-of-pocket expenditure. This measure will design and implement a targeted \nhealth program to reduce out-of-pocket expenditures of eligible households when accessing health \nservices during the financial crisis. The policy measure will apply an interim strategy to identify poor \nhouseholds until the national PMT database of poor households is ready.30 Implementation will be \nthrough  an  accompanying  project  made  possible  through  a  JFPR  grant  aimed  at  protecting  the \npoor during the financial crisis (footnote 29).  \n \n\n3. \n\nEducation \n\n \n\na. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 8: Textbooks for the Poor \n\n68. \nPolicy  Framework.  Paying for textbooks is a major barrier to education for the poor. This \nprogram measure, which is focused at the policy level, will pave the way for a related project that \nwill provide secondary school textbooks to targeted poor households (footnote 29).  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  MOECS,  the  Government  will \nestablish  a  working  group  to  assess  the  implementation  viability  of  PMT  for \ntextbooks. \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  MOECS,  the  Government  will \napprove  target  subsidies  for  secondary  level  textbooks  taking  into  account  the \nfindings of the working group. \n\n \nThese  measures  will  complement  the  Education  for  the  Poor  project,  which  will  support \n69. \ntargeted  secondary  school  textbook  subsidies  from  2009  to  2011.  The  project  will  target \napproximately  100,000  students  from  low-income  families  who  will  benefit  from  receiving  free \ntextbooks.  Related  project  efforts  will  include  a  review  of  the  current  targeting  of  textbooks, \nincluding how targeting decisions are made and verified and the reasons for leakage to the non-\npoor. Based on this review, the project will make recommendations to improve targeting, including \ngeographical targeting.31  \n \n\nb. \n\nPolicy Reform Areas 9 and 10: Expansion of Teaching Methods \n\n70. \nPolicy  Framework.  Poor  teaching is a constraint on childhood development, especially in \npoor areas. Two closely related policy reform areas will pave the way for a better in-service teacher \ntraining  system  to  expand  new  child-focused  teaching  methods,  including  to  ger  areas  and  an \nevaluation system for teachers consistent with new educational standards. \n \n\n(i) \n\nFirst tranche policy measures. Through the MOECS, the Government will prepare \na  draft  action  plan  for  in-service  teacher  training  that  will  pave  the  way  for  an \nexpansion of new teaching methods. It will also establish a working group to assess \nthe evaluation system for the new teaching methods being piloted under ministerial \norder 416. \n\n                                                 \n30 The medicard program will work closely with the ADB-supported FNSWPP. \n31 Different targeting methods are being piloted under the ADB Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project in \nMongolia (approved in 2008). The Education for the Poor  project  will analyze the feasibility of using the database of \nbeneficiaries under the FNSWPP for the targeting of textbooks. \n\n \n\n\f16       \n\n(ii) \n\nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  MOECS,  the  Government  will \nfinalize the action plan. It will also print and distribute teachers' guidebooks on the \nnew  teaching  methods  to  all  relevant  teachers  as  well  as  approve  the  new \nevaluation system. \n\n \nInternational  experience  shows  that  \"rote\"  teaching  methods  do  not  adequately  prepare \n71. \nstudents for the challenges that lie ahead. Experiences from the 1997  Asian financial crisis have \nshown  that  when  households  suffer  loss  of  income,  more  children  and  young  people  drop  out  of \nschool; engage in child labor; and suffer from malnutrition, stunting, and other health problems. If \neducation  programs  aimed  at  children  are  cut  as  a  consequence  of  fiscal  tightening,  this  will  put \nthe burden of the crisis on the most vulnerable members of the society. If the quality of education \ndrops  as  a  consequence,  the  poor  will  be  the  most  affected,  as  better-off  households  will  seek \nalternatives such as enrolling children in private schools or sending them abroad. Policy measures \n9 and 10 build on technical assistance provided by JICA and ADB and will help to ensure that the \nquality of education is maintained or improved in the short and the long term.  \n \n\n4. \n\nUrban Development \n\n \n\na. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 11: Urban Living Conditions \n\n72. \nPolicy Framework. Unplanned urban development undermines the standard of living in the \ncapital, especially in the poor ger areas inhabited primarily by the poor. This measure will improve \nconditions  by  revising  the  Ulaanbaatar  master  plan,  including  ger  areas,  and  prioritizing  of \nprograms, to ensure basic services and improve living conditions. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transportation, \nConstruction  and  Urban  Development  (MRTCUD)  and  the  Ulaanbataar  Municipal \nOffice,  the  Government  will  establish  a  working  group,  which  will  include \nenvironment  and  resettlement  experts,  to  (a)  revise  the  Ulaanbaatar  master  plan \nbased  on  the  final  draft  of  Ulaanbaatar  master  plan  study,  and  (b)  prioritize \nprograms.  \nSecond tranche policy measures. The Government will secure the funding for the \nrevision of the master plan working group.  \n\n \n73. \nThe population of Ulaanbaatar has been growing rapidly. New per-urban settlements have \nhappened  in  an  ad  hoc  fashion  and  roads,  utilities,  and  other  infrastructure  in  these  areas  are \ninadequate.  The  populations  of  the  ger  districts  are  predominantly  poor  with  very  unsatisfactory \nliving standards. Piecemeal measures to develop the ger areas are costly and have not improved \nliving  standards  sufficiently.  Unless  a  plan  is  developed  and  implemented,  urban  sprawl  and \nuncontrolled  development  will  continue  to  take  place.  Given  the  weak  legislative  framework \ngoverning land ownership and management, unplanned and uncontrolled development will further \nreduce living standards, leaving the poor in the ger districts with inadequate services and a lack of \neconomic opportunities. This policy measure will pave the way for new planning initiatives that will \ninclude ger areas.  \n \n\nb. \n\nPolicy Reform Area 12: Ger Area Development \n\n74. \nPolicy Framework. The Ulaanbaatar Municipal Office has limited capacity to plan for poor \nger areas. This measure will help to build capacity and support guidelines for the improvement of \nliving conditions in ger areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17        \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  the  Ulaanbaatar  Municipal  Office,  the \nGovernment will establish a working group on capacity building for the development \nof the ger areas. \nSecond  tranche  policy  measures.  Through  Ulaanbaatar  Municipal  Office,  the \nGovernment  will  develop  capacity  building  materials  and  guidelines  for  (a)  the \ndevelopment of ger areas, and (b) environment and other social safeguard policies. \n\n \n\n75. \nThis  policy  measure  will  pave  the  way  for  new  planning  initiatives  that  include  ger  areas. \nThrough  accompanying  TA  training,  capacity  building  will  be  provided,  with  a  particular  focus  on \nsocial and environmental safeguards.  \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nFocus  on  Key  Sectors  in  ADB  Portfolio.  The  ADB  response  addresses  the  immediate \n76. \nneeds of the Government and targets sectors that are key to existing and planned ADB portfolio. \nFirst tranche conditions and assurances focus on maintaining levels of funding and preparing the \nground for reform, building consensus and a knowledge base. Second tranche conditions focus on \nreaching  agreement  within  each  sector  on  the  proposed  reform  measures  and  implementation \nstrategies. \n \n77. \nJoint  ADB\u2013JICA  Policy  Matrix. The Program is based on a joint policy matrix developed \nby ADB and JICA in close collaboration with and agreed by the Government. The Program will be \ncofinanced by JICA under a parallel cofinancing arrangement. \n \n78. \nAgreement  with  the  World  Bank  on  Social  Protection  Direction.  ADB  has  consulted \nclosely  with  the  World  Bank  on  social  welfare  reforms.  There  is  clear  agreement  on  the  nature, \nform,  and  direction  for  social  welfare  and  coordination  of  support  and  funding  to  achieve  the \nagreed-upon  goals.  The  World  Bank's  policy  matrix  includes  a  measure  to  clean  the  beneficiary \nroster of the CMP as a first step toward making this a targeted program. The measure is consistent \nwith the social welfare reform supported by ADB. \n \n79. \nNational Database. The policy measures under the Program, together with accompanying \nTA provided by ADB, the World Bank, JICA and UNDP, will enable the Government in the longer-\nterm to establish a national database that different sectors can use for targeting the poor for health, \nhealth insurance, education, social welfare, and other government subsidies.  \n \n80. \nImproving  the  Pro-Poor  Orientation  of  Government  Policies.  Policy  measures  create \nthe foundation for reform to ensure pro-poor targeting and efficient development. Consultations will \nbe held with civil society groups to ensure their support for reforms and that the reforms meet the \npriority needs of the poor. The reorienting of specific programs and the development of tools and \nsystems that allow for a pro-poor focus will benefit those most in need and address the prospects \nfor  long-term  change  by  ensuring  that  such  basic  services  as  health,  education,  and  living \nconditions are protected during the global economic crisis. \n \n81. \nComplementarities  and  Synergies  with  ADB  and  JICA  Supported  Projects  in \nMongolia.  The  policy  reforms  included  in  the  policy  matrix  require  TA  to  ensure  their  proper \nimplementation. During the processing of the Program, ADB provided TA to the MSWL, the MOH, \nand the MOECS to prepare the implementation of the policy reforms and meet the policy measures \nof  the  first  tranche.32 During  implementation  and  after  the  Program,  assistance  will  be  provided \nthrough accompanying TA and by synergies developed with ongoing ADB supported projects.

The accompanying TA will support the \ndevelopment  of  a  national  database  of  poor  households,  promote  the  development  of  an \nintersectoral  PMT,  and  provide  capacity  development  for  environmental  concerns  and  social \nsafeguards in urban planning and development. The JFPR project, Protecting the Health Status of \nthe Poor during the Financial Crisis, will assist in the design of the medicard program and ensure \ncoverage of household micronutrients is expanded. The Education for the Poor project will support \na  targeted  program  of  secondary  school  textbook  distribution.  The  Third  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Project will also support measures to promote access to primary health care services \nand  enroll  the  poor  in  health  insurance.  JICA  will  provide  TA  support  for  education  and  urban \ndevelopment. Supplementary Appendix D illustrates the synergies of the Program with other ADB \nand  JICA  supported  programs  and  projects.  A  donor-coordinated  implementation  schedule  of \nmajor Program activities is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n82. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  program  loan  of  $43.1  million  equivalent  from  ADB's \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF) and an ADF grant of $16.9 million for the Program to support the \nfiscal  adjustment  necessary  for  Mongolia's  economic  stabilization  program.  The  ADF  loan  will  be \nfinanced  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  annual  interest  rate  of  1.0%  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  It  will  have  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears.  The  terms  and  conditions  for  the  loan  and  the  grant  will  be  as  set  forth  in  the  Financing \nAgreement. The Program will be cofinanced by JICA, under a parallel cofinancing arrangement. \n \n83. \nThe  collapse  of  the  price  of  copper,  Mongolia\u2019s  major  export  commodity,  has  severely \ndisrupted its economy, exacerbating pre-existing balance of payments and fiscal imbalances. The \nIMF  has  estimated  that  only  $2.049  billion  in  external  financing  will  be  available  to  Mongolia \nagainst  gross  external  financing  requirements  of  $2.486  billion  leaving  a  financing  need  of  $437 \nmillion. Given that this coincides with higher domestic and higher international borrowing costs, the \nGovernment prefers program loans from development partners to bridge this gap.  \n \n84. \nThe  IMF  has  estimated  that  Mongolia  will  need  $284  million  of  external  financing  in  2009 \nand $153 million in 2010. The IMF stand-by arrangement will provide $139 million in 2009 and $93 \nmillion in 2010. The ADB program support will provide $60 million in 2009, and the Government of \nJapan through JICA will provide $30 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2010. The World Bank will \nprovide  $40  million  in  200933 and  $20  million  in  2010.  These  combined  disbursements  will  cover \nmost of the financing shortfall, with a gap of $15 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2010 which the \nGovernment  envisages  covering  through  assistance  from  other  donors.  The  cofinancing  effort  by \nADB,  JICA  and  World  Bank  addresses  macroeconomic  and  social  protection  issues.  The \ndevelopment coordination matrix illustrates the specific reforms under each of the above financiers \n(Appendix  4).  Counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  Program  will  be  used  for \nbudget support in meeting Government expenditures for social sectors. The Program amount has \ntaken  into  account  the  IMF's  estimated  fiscal  gap  and  partners'  contributions  to  fill  the  gap.  The \namended  budget  passed  in  March  2009  was  conditional  on  commitments  made  by  development \nagencies  to  fill  the  fiscal  gap.  This amended  budget  minimized  cuts  in  social sector  budgets and \nprotected current expenditures at the expense of capital expenditures. Budget cuts for social sector \nministries\u2014e.g.,  MSWL  (19%),  MOH  (10%),  and  MOECS  (10.8%)\u2014were  generally  less  drastic \nthan  cuts  for  other  ministries\u2014e.g.,  MRTCUD  (39.75%),  Ministry  of  Fuel  and  Energy  (34.79%). \nFurther budget cuts are planned for June 2009, and these will affect the social sectors, if the fiscal \ngap cannot be entirely closed. \n \n\n                                                 \n33 Tentative World Bank Board consideration is planned in late May 2009. \n\n \n\n\f19        \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n85. \nProgram Management. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA) \nand will assume overall responsibility for the implementation of the Program. The MSWL, the MOH, \nthe  MOECS,  the  MRTCUD,  and  the  Ulaanbaatar  Municipal  Office  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies.  Each  implementing  agency  will  assume  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the \npolicy measures related to its areas of responsibilities.  \n \n86. \nIn its capacity as the EA, MOF will establish the Program Steering Committee (PSC) to be \nchaired  by  the  state  secretary  of  the  MOF.  The  members  of  the  PSC  will  be  the  senior \nrepresentatives  of  the  implementing  agencies.  The  PSC  will  (i)  monitor  the  Program,  and  (ii) \nprovide policy and strategic guidance.  \n \nThe  MOF  will  also  establish  a  program  support  unit  (PSU)  that  will  (i)  serve  as  the \n87. \nsecretariat of the PSC; (ii) manage the implementation of the Program, including liaising with the \nvarious implementation agencies to ensure proper and timely achievement, adoption, compliance \nwith, and implementation of the policy measures; and (iii) prepare and submit necessary reports, \nincluding  periodic  progress  reports,  to  ADB.  The  MOF  will  appoint  one  of  its  staff  members  from \nthe  Department  of  Development  Financing  and  Cooperation  to  head  the  PSU.  A  deputy  will  be \nrecruited  externally  through  a  competitive  process  to  be  financed  through  an  accompanying  TA. \nThe  deputy  will  be  assisted  by  an  administrative  assistant,  hired  under  the  accompanying  TA,  to \nfacilitate coordination and administration of the TA inputs and reporting. The MOF will also allocate \nappropriate office space and facilities to ensure an effective and efficient PSU. Each implementing \nagency will appoint a staff member to act as its program focal point and coordinate with the head of \nthe PSU. \n \n88. \nImplementation Period. The implementation period is from April 2009 to December 2010. \nThe loan closing date will be 31 December 2010. The duration of the Program, which has started in \nApril 2009, will extend up to December 2010 (12 months after the planned release of the second \ntranche) for the following reasons: (i) the JICA second tranche release is in April 2010, (ii) to allow \nfor better monitoring of the execution of the 2010 budget and avoid budget amendments that would \ncounter  reforms  that  have  already  been  passed,  and  (iii)  to  make  prolonged  and  intense  policy \ndialogue more likely than could be achieved through the TA. \n \n89. \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the \nproceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower  and  Grant \nRecipient. The proceeds of the loan and the grant will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced in, and procured from, ADB\u2019s member \ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 5) and imports financed \nby  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  and  from  countries  that  are  not  ADB  members.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  that  (i)  the  value  of  the  country\u2019s  eligible  imports  is  equal  to  or  exceeds \nADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan and the grant in a given period; and (ii) the loan and \nthe grant proceeds will be used as agreed in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan and the grant \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  for  program  loans \nand  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  loan \nand  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  based  on  the  separate  withdrawal  applications  and \ncertifications  provided  by  the  Government  for  loan  and  grant  resources,  which  confirm  that  the \nabove loan and grant requirements have been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the \nloan and the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n90. \nTranching.  ADB  and  JICA  have  prepared  a  joint  policy  matrix,  which  includes  policy \nmeasures to ensure basic services to the poor during the crisis and to initiate long-term reforms to \n\nProcurement  and  Disbursement. \n\nIn  accordance  with \n\n \n\n\f20       \n\nimprove the efficiency of social transfers and living conditions of the poor. ADB's program amount \nwill be released in two tranches, the first tranche tentatively in July 2009 (and after the Financing \nAgreement  has  been  declared  effective)  once  the  Government  has  completed  the  first  tranche \nactions  and  the  second  tranche  tentatively  in  December  2009,  once  the  Government  has \ncompleted  the  second  tranche  actions  of  the  joint  policy  matrix  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB  as \nconfirmed  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  (Appendix  6).  The  proposed  amounts  to  be  released \nand their timing by ADB and JICA are illustrated in Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1: ADB \u2013 JICA Tranche Releases \n($ million) \n\n \n\nFirst Tranche \n\nSecond Tranche \n\n \n\nItem \n60 \nADB \n50 \nJICA \n \n \nTotal \n110 \na  The first tranche will be disbursed based fully from the loan resources, while the second tranche will be a combination \n\n40a \n                              30 \n \n                               70 \n\nDecember 2009 \n20a \n \n \n\n                    20 \n\n                 20 \n\n \n20b \n \n\nApril 2010 \n\nJuly 2009 \n\nTotal \n\nof the balance of the loan and grant resources (84.5% grant resources and 15.5% loan resources). \n\nb  Disbursement under phase 2 of the Social Sectors Support Program (JICA), expected to become effective in April 2010. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n91. \nProgram  Performance  Management  System.  The  MOF,  through  the  PSU,  will  be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  implementation  of  the  Program.  The  continuous \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  policy  matrix  related  reforms;  the  fulfillment  of  the  policy \nmeasures included in the joint ADB-JICA policy matrix, in line with the overall program framework; \nand  the  output  and  outcome  indicators  of  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  agreed  by  the \nGovernment  are  central  to  program  performance  management.  The  MOF  will  prepare  quarterly \nprogress  reports  and  a  final  completion  report  in  December  2010  on  the  status  of  program \nimplementation  (including  the  status  of  the  proposed  program's  outcome  and  impact  indicators) \nand submit these to ADB and JICA. The quarterly reports will track the implementation of the policy \nreforms, TA implementation, and the indicators of the design and monitoring framework. \n \n92. \nProgram Review. ADB will conduct joint missions with JICA and the Government to assess \nthe  fulfillment  of  the  policy  measures  of  the  joint  policy  matrix  in  preparation  for  the  release  of \nfunding for each of the two tranches. A review mission will take place in December 2009 and two \nadditional review missions will take place in 2010. The missions will identify issues and constraints, \ndetermine  necessary  remedial  actions  and  adjustments,  and  advise  on  actions  required  to  keep \nthe  Program  on  course.  The  joint  review  missions  will  coordinate  and  collaborate  with  other \nongoing programs supporting Mongolia's stabilization program, including with IMF. \n \n93. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  MOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProgram. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of the Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan and grant regulations. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProgram  and  TA  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the MSWL and the MOF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \nIn  2008,  a  sector  risk  assessment34 was  carried  out  for  Mongolia  for  national  systems  as \n94. \nwell  as  the  education  and  urban  transport  sectors  in  the  areas  of  public  finance  management, \n\n                                                 \n34 The risk assessment was carried out following the 2008 guidelines of the Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan \n\n(GACAP II). \n\n \n\n\f21        \n\nprocurement,  and  anticorruption.  This  found  that  Mongolia's  legal,  policy,  and  institutional \nframeworks  remain  generally  inadequate  to  mitigate  or  obviate  risk  in  national  and  sectoral \nsystems.  Significant  vulnerabilities  and  risk  in  public  finance  management  stem  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s limited capacity to implement development policies and reform, and to ensure that \nall  elements,  notably  budget  formulation,  allocation,  and  execution  are  consistent  with  policy \npriorities.  There  is  also  evidence  that  interventionist  central  planning,  and  political  interference \nintroduces additional vulnerability and risk that must be mitigated. Procurement risks include a lack \nof  capacity,  knowledge,  and  adequate  training  to  equip  professional  procurement  officers  to \ndispatch  their  duties  and  responsibilities  fairly  and  transparently.  Political  interference,  conflict  of \ninterest, and corruption are manifest within national and sectoral procurement systems. Corruption \nis  pervasive,  and  additional  support  to  the  Government  of  Mongolia,  and  to  the  Independent \nAuthority Against Corruption is required to strengthen institutional capacity and effectiveness.35 \n \nThe  proposed  Program  will  provide  funding  to  reduce  the  fiscal  gap  and  require  policy \n95. \nactions  from  the  MSWL,  the  MOH,  the  MOECS,  the  MRTCUD,  and  the  Ulaanbaatar  City \ngovernment. The funds are not earmarked for any of the implementing agencies and the Program \ndoes  not  include  procurement  activities.  Therefore,  risks  arising  from  the  handling  of  funds  or \nprocurement  activities  within  the  concerned  ministries  are  not  expected.  The  risk  assessment  of \nnational  systems  (para.  94)  identified  risks  related  to  public  finance  management  and  corruption, \nwhich are applicable to the present Program. Reforms to reduce the risk of corruption and improve \npublic  financial  and  procurement  systems  are  underway  by  the  Government.  Donors,  including \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  will  help  to  put  mitigation  measures  in  place  to  address  the  identified \nrisks.36 The proposed measures are beyond the scope of this proposed quick response Program. \n \n96. \nAccounting  and  Reporting.  The  Government  must  open  a  Loan  Deposit  account  and  a \nGrant Deposit Account with the Central Bank of Mongolia to receive all loan and grant proceeds. \nThe accounts will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan and grant proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the Government's certification for the withdrawal applications. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n97. \nObjectives. The TA aims to support the implementation and coordination of policy reforms \nunder  the  Program.  Specifically,  it  will  (i)  support  policy  reforms  on  targeting  assistance  and \nimproving  social  sector  efficiency,  (ii)  strengthen  statistical  analysis  and  data  collection,  (iii)  build \ncapacity  for  the  management  of  an  intersectoral  national  database  of  beneficiaries  of  social \nassistance and other government subsidies, (iv) develop consensus on targeting social assistance \nwith national and local government officials and the public, and (v) develop environment and social \nsafeguard capacity for urban development stakeholders in Ulaanbaatar. \n\n                                                 \n35 The main proposed reforms to improve public financial  systems are: (i) strengthening the public financing framework \nby  better  aligning  policy  priorities  with  budgeting  and  anchoring  the  budget  to  clear  fiscal  rules,  (ii)  allowing  public \naccess to budget documents, (iii) amending the budget process to limit the scope for undue external interference, and \n(iv) strengthening the financial management capacity of all line ministries. To improve procurement systems, two main \nmeasures are called for: (i) facilitating the engagement of the public and civil society in procurement monitoring, and \n(ii)  strengthening  the  Independent  Authority  Against  Corruption.  Proposed  reforms  to  reduce  the  risk  of  corruption \ninclude:  (i)  strengthening  the  legislative  and  institutional  framework,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law  to  criminalize \nprivate  sector  corruption,  illicit  enrichment,  criminal  conflict  of  interest,  and  election-related  offenses;  and  (ii) \nimplementing anticorruption plans and codes of ethical conduct in ministries and agencies. \n\n36 The  World  Bank  aims  to  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  governance \nprocesses in the management of public finances, (ii) promoting transparency and accountability in the performance of \npublic  sector  functions,  and  (iii)  fostering  the  investment  climate  in  Mongolia.  ADB's  objective  is  to  mitigate \nprocurement  and  corruption  risks  in  the  education  sector  in  Mongolia  through  carrying  out  procurement  and \nanticorruption priority  interventions at the sectoral level and enhance institutional and  staff capacity in the Ministry  of \nEducation, Culture and Science. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22       \n\n \nA. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n98. \nThe TA will help ensure that reform targets are met and that the foundations for systemic \nchange  across  sectors  are  built,  promoting  efficiency,  the  prioritization  of  the  poor,  and  the \nprovision  of  targeted  social  assistance.  The  TA  will  help  to  build  firm  foundations  for  change \nthrough strategic capacity development and will develop a consensus-building program on the role \nof social assistance and the classification of recipients.  \n \nSector  Policy  Reform  Coordination  and  Implementation  Support. The TA will support \n99. \nthe Government and MOF to coordinate the policy reforms across the sectors as envisaged in the \npolicy  matrix.  A  national  consultant  will  work  in  the  PSU  and  help  the  MOF  to  manage \nimplementation and coordination of the Program, prepare and submit reports for the Government \nand  ADB,  support  ADB  missions,  liaise  with  the  appointed  focal  points  and  working  groups  from \neach  ministry,  and  coordinate  the  consultant  inputs  from  the  other  components  of  the  TA.  The \nnational  consultant  will  be  the  deputy  of  the  head  of  the  PSU  and  will  be  assisted  by  an \nadministrative assistant. \n \n100.  Sector-Specific  Capacity  Development  to  Support  Targeting.  The  TA  will  support \ncapacity  building  for  targeting  within  the  MOH  and  the  MOECS  by  (i)  supporting  the  working \ngroups  in  each  ministry  as  they  decide  how  to  integrate  PMT  and  other  targeting  methodologies \ninto their assistance strategies, (ii) providing assistance in developing monitoring methodologies for \nthe  targeted  assistance,  and  (iii)  providing  guidelines  and  training  for  the  implementation  of  PMT \nand other targeting methods in the programs outlined in the policy matrix.  \n \n101.  NSO  Capacity  Development  in  Statistical  Analysis  and  Data  Gathering.  An  effective \nPMT  is  dependent  on  reliable  data  on  poverty  levels  and  on  the  capacity  to  identify  and  analyze \nnew  vulnerable  populations  over  time.  The  TA  will  help  the  NSO  to  train  staff  in  targeting \nmethodologies  (such  as  PMT  and  poverty  mapping),  data  collection,  processing,  and  analysis  to \nsupport  ministries  seeking  to  target  their  benefits  at  the  poor.  This  assistance  will  support  the \nreforms  under  the  Program  and  provide  a  foundation  for  the  sustainable  use  of  PMT  and  other \ntargeting methodologies across different sectors. \n \nIntersectoral  Beneficiaries  Database.  The  beneficiaries  identified  by  the  PMT  will  form \n102. \nthe basis for a national database of the poor, which can be used by sectors and programs across \nthe  country.  There  is  a  risk  that,  by  accumulating  different  types  of  transfers,  a  household  might \nrise  above  the  poverty  threshold  defined  by  the  PMT,  making  an  intersectoral  database  of \nbeneficiaries  and  transfers  essential.  Therefore,  the  TA  will  support  the  development  and \nmanagement  of  an  intersectoral  database  that  links  information  on  benefits  and  beneficiaries, \nallows  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  sector  programs,  and  avoids  the  overaccumulation  of \nbenefits in any given household.  \n \n103.  Consensus  Building  on  Reforming  Social  Assistance. Targeted social assistance has \nbeen  implemented  successfully  in  Mongolia  before,  but  new  government  revenues  encouraged \npoliticians  to  promote  universal  access.  Reluctance  to  change  from  universal  access  is  therefore \nan important risk that the Program must address. The TA will support a government advocacy and \npublic awareness program for (i) parliamentarians, (ii) civil society, and (iii) the public. The program \nwill focus on building a consensus on social assistance targeting through workshops and outreach \nactivities that will focus on (i) the benefits of targeting, (ii) the need for fiscal sustainability, (iii) the \nmechanics of identification, and (iv) grievance mechanisms. Building understanding and trust in the \nsystem from the ground up to decision makers will help ensure that reforms are adhered to in the \nfuture. \n \n\n \n\n\f23        \n\n104.  Developing  Environment  and  Social  Safeguards  Capacity \nfor  Ulaanbaatar \nStakeholders.  The  revision  of  the  Ulaanbaatar  master  plan  and  capacity  development  in  urban \ndevelopment strategies is the focus of two of the proposed policy reforms under the Program. To \naddress the concerns of the poor living in ger areas, it is essential that adequate capacity be built \nin  safeguards  implementation  and  management  of  consultation  processes.  The  TA37 will  support \nstrategic capacity building in environment and social safeguards for Ulaanbaatar.  \n \nB. \n\nCost Estimates and Implementation Arrangements \n\n105.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. It \nwill be financed on a grant basis from the TA Special Fund-IV in the amount of $700,000. The TA \nwill  finance  consulting  services;  equipment  and  software;  surveys;  workshops  and  training; \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  activities;  contingencies;  and  miscellaneous \nadministration  and  support  costs.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency \ncost, equivalent to $100,000, through the provision of counterpart staff, office facilities, and other \nsupport services. The detailed cost estimates, financing plan and outline terms of reference are in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n106. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  The  MOF  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Program  and  the  TA, \nwhich  will  have  similar  organization  structures.  The  PSU  for  the  Program  will  coordinate  the \nactivities and outputs of the TA and provide oversight and guidance. The TA grant is intended to \nfacilitate  program  reforms  and  will  therefore  be  integrated  with  program  implementation.  The \nGovernment will integrate common activities and processes among ADB-supported programs and \nprojects including the FNSWPP, Third Health Sector Development Project, and Education for the \nPoor, thereby improving the efficiency of implementation, especially in procurement and consultant \nselection. The TA will be implemented over 2 years and will be completed by June 2011, 6 months \nafter completion of the Program (December 2010).  \n  \n107.  Procurement and Consultant Selection. All equipment and materials will be procured by \nthe MOF in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nOwnership  will  be  transferred  to  the  Government  after  completion  of  the  TA.  The  equipment  and \nmaterials  procured  will  include  computers,  software,  printers,  and  other  equipment  necessary  for \nthe  implementation  of  TA  activities.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) for the recruitment of international and \nnational consultants. ADB will recruit the consultants on an individual basis. Each TA component \nwill require consulting services of up to three individual consultants. A total of 19 person-months of \ninternational  consultants  (6  consultants)  and  46  person-months  of  national  consultants  (7 \nconsultants) will be needed to support TA activities. \n \n108.  Disbursement  and  Reporting.  The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008). Direct payment procedures will be used to \npay  for  consulting  services.  An  advance  payment  facility  for  the  TA  will  be  established  with  the \nMOF for workshops, training expenditures, and procurement of the equipment. The MOF is familiar \nwith  ADB  procedures  and  has  adequate  financial  management  capacity  to  handle  the  advance \npayment  facility.  Costed  activity  proposals,  approved  by  the  MOF,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval.  The  reporting  and  review  of  the  TA  will  be  combined  with  that  of  the  Program  and  will \nfollow the procedures laid down for the Program. The quarterly, annual, and TA completion reports, \nincluded with the reports on the Program, will include a summary financial report on the TA. \n \n\n                                                 \n37 The TA will be complemented by support from the Regional and Sustainable Development Department at ADB. \n\n \n\n\f24       \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n\n109.  Beneficiaries  and  Fiscal  Sustainability.  By  strengthening  and  reforming  social  welfare \nsystems, and especially by improving targeting, the Program will help to improve the performance \nand fiscal sustainability of the Government. By converting the CMP to a targeted benefit, the IMF \nestimates that MNT61,033 million could be saved. The elimination of exclusion and inclusion errors \nwill  result  in  social  assistance  reaching  945,000  beneficiaries,  a  reduction  of  355,000  from  the \n1,300,000 receiving social assistance in 2008.38 By targeting other social benefits more efficiently, \nanother MNT12,206 million could be saved.39 With these savings, equivalent to 1.16% of GDP in \n2009, the Government could increase benefit levels for the poorest households without creating an \nunsustainable fiscal burden. The additional benefit will lift about 40,000 people above the poverty \nline.  Fiscal  sustainability  will  provide  a  basis  for  sound  economic  recovery,  and  thereby  diminish \nthe burden on the state to provide for the unemployed and other groups made vulnerable by the \nfinancial crisis. The poor will benefit, as they will receive at least the same level of CMP benefit as \nin 2008. The Government will benefit from the stronger public finances and the MSWL will benefit \nfrom  a  streamlined  and  targeted  system.  Non-poor  will  be  dropped  as  beneficiaries.  As  eligibility \nwill be based on poverty level and the overall benefit amount is not substantial, the loss of income \nfor these stakeholders will not have a significant impact on their consumption level. In addition, it is \nestimated that there will be (i) 1,550,000 drug discount beneficiaries; (ii) 303,000 people who are \ncurrently  uninsured  who  will  benefit  from  improved  targeting  of  health  insurance  subsidies;  (iii) \n83,000  children  under  2  years  of  age  who  will  benefit  from  micronutrient  supplementation;  (iv) \n630,000  poor  who  will  benefit  from  the  medicard  program;  and  (v)  100,000  secondary  school \nstudents  who  will  receive  textbook  subsidies.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  contains  additional \nestimates of program beneficiaries by policy reform. \n \n110.  Consolidation  of  Welfare  Benefit. The Program will significantly improve the institutional \ncapacity  of  the  Government  to  consolidate  and  target  social  welfare  benefits.  The  cabinet-level \nworking  group  and  other  working  groups  at  ministerial  level  will  be  key  to  this.  The  Program  will \nimprove the policy framework for consolidating social transfers and will therefore complement the \nobjectives of the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Project to rationalize social welfare.  \n \n111.  Paving  the  Way  for  Associated  Projects. The policy measures of the Program that are \nfocused on targeting social welfare benefits will pave the way for associated projects in health (the \nmedicard  program  and  household  micronutrients)  (footnote  29)  and  in  education  (school \ntextbooks).40 These  projects  will  help  very  poor  households  to  meet  their  basic  needs  during  the \nfinancial crisis.  The  Program  will  also  build  on the  FNSWPP  by  extending  the  PMT  to  the  health \nand education sectors so that these benefits are well targeted. \n \n112.  Harmonization  of  Development  Efforts.  The  Program\u2019s  efforts  to  harmonize  its \ninterventions  with  other  international  efforts  (e.g.,  those  of  the  IMF,  JICA,  UNDP,  and  the  World \nBank), and the Government\u2019s broader plans and programs (e.g., social welfare reform), will help to \nprevent duplication of effort and ensure the efficiency of social welfare programs and targeting in \nhealth and education. \n\n                                                 \n38 These  estimations  are  based  on  existing  MSWL  data  and  will  be  validated  in  the  process  of  designing  the  social \n\nwelfare reform and transition strategy. \n\n39 IMF. 2009. Mongolia Public Expenditure Review, Ulaanbaatar. The elimination of benefits to those who do not depend \non them for their  well-being will provide an additional avenue for potential savings. Under the current Social Welfare \nLaw,  2006,  the  Mongolian  government  awards  four  different  types  of  universal  benefits  to  citizens;  child  money,  the \nnewlywed  benefit,  newborn  benefit,  and  the  benefit  given  to  pregnant  women.  In  2008,  these  benefits  amounted  to \nMNT147,970 million. \n\n40 ADB.  2009.  Education  for  the  Poor\u2013Financial  Crisis  Response  Project.  Manila  (effectiveness  expected  in  August \n\n2009). \n\n \n\n\f25        \n\n \nImproved  Government  Capacity.  The  reform  measures  will  improve  the  capacity  of  the \n113. \nGovernment to deliver consolidated and targeted safety welfare assistance. The accompanying TA \nwill  pave  the  way  for  a  nationwide  PMT,  the  results  of  which  will  enable  the  Government  to \nestablish and manage a unified social security database that serves the needs of several sectors. \nIn urban planning, capacity building will focus on ensuring that expertise is available to build social \nand environmental safeguards into planning exercises. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n114. \nInstitutional  Impact.  Government  institutions,  particularly  the  MSWL,  the  MOH,  and  the \nMOECS, will be better able to reform themselves and deliver social welfare services. The unified \ndatabase  will  enable  different  sectors  to  target  their  services  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  the \npopulation. \n \n115.  Poverty Reduction. Mongolia\u2019s social welfare system has had a limited impact on poverty \nreduction  because  of  its  poor  targeting.  Under  the  Program,  benefits  will  be  consolidated  and \ntargeting  will  be  greatly  improved,  resulting  in  significant  cost  savings.  This  will  create  an \nopportunity to increase the size of key benefits benefiting households in the lowest quintile, many \nof  whom  depend  on  such  benefits.  Subsidized  essential  drugs  will  be  made  available  in  greater \nmeasure  in  PHC  and  outpatient  facilities.  Out-of-pocket  expenses  will  decline  and  fewer  poor \npatients  will  require  hospitalization.  Malnourished  children  will  receive  critical  micronutrients  at \nhome. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 7, and the poverty and \nsocial assessment is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n116.  Gender  Benefits.  These  social  welfare  reforms  will  have  consequences  for  virtually  all \ncitizens,  male  and  female.  Access  to  health  services  and  education  are  particularly  gendered  in \nMongolia.  More  women  than  men  use  primary  health  care facilities,  and  girls  have  higher  school \nand  tertiary  education  enrollment  than  boys.  Special  efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  that  these \ndisparities  are  addressed  in  the  reform  and  targeting  programs.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been \nprepared  to  maximize  the  opportunities  for  gender  impact  in  design  and  implementation  and  to \nprovide  adequate  and  sex-disaggregated  data  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Program \n(Appendix 8). \n \n117.  Economic  and  Financial  Impacts.  The  Program  will  provide  direct  budgetary  support  to \nthe Government. The nature of the Program limits the scope for quantitative economic analysis but \nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  specific  measures  were  undertaken.  Supplementary \nAppendix  I  provides  the  economic  and  financial  analysis  of  the  Program,  including  the  projected \nreduction  in  (i)  the  Government's  fiscal  burden  and  (ii)  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  the  poorest \nsegment of the population. \n \n118.  The social protection expenditure of the State can be divided into: (i) pensions and benefits \n(e.g.  old  age,  disability,  military,  accident  pensions,  and  sickness,  funeral,  and  unemployment \nbenefits); and (ii) social welfare expenses (e.g. allowances for children under 18 years, pregnancy \nand  maternity  leave,  newly  weds,  newborns,  school  lunches,  and  textbooks).  Very  few  savings \nwould be possible by reducing expenditure in the first category, as these pensions and benefits are \nwell  established  and  have  statutory  protection.  However,  the  economic  analysis  illustrates  that \nproxy  means  testing  could  lead  to  significant  savings  in  the  second  category  by  targeting  social \nwelfare benefits at people living below the poverty line (35% of the population). If the CMP, which \nmakes  up  more  than  half  the  expenditure  in  this  category,  was  focused  on  these  households, \nMNT69,000 million could be saved from the original 2009 budget. By targeting other social benefits \nin  the  same  way  (including  reducing  duplication  of  benefits),  the  IMF  estimates  that  another \nMNT12,206 million could be saved. \n\n \n\n\f26       \n\n \n119.  The  net  effects  of  the  five  interventions  in  the  health  sector  will  be  to  improve  the  health \noutcomes  of  the  poor  by  reducing  their  out-of-pocket  costs  and  improving  their  access  to  health \nservices during the crisis and after. According to the 2007\u20132008 household socioeconomic survey, \npeople  in  the  poorest  quintile  spend  an  average  of  MNT1,001  per  month,  or  2%  of  their  total \nconsumption,  on  health  care.  If  such  out-of-pocket  expenses  were  to  be  eliminated  for  the \nexpected duration of the financial crisis, the net benefit would be MNT13.1 billion (at 2009 prices).  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n120.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Program is designed to minimize the effects of \nthe financial crisis on the most vulnerable segment of the population through the implementation of \npolicy measures in the social welfare, health, and education sector. These activities will not trigger \nany  resettlement  issues.  Capacity  development  for  social  safeguards,  including  in  the  area  of \nresettlement and indigenous people, will increase consideration of these issues in the revision of \nthe  Ulaanbaatar  master  plan  and  the  incorporation  of  safeguard  measures  into  future  urban \ninfrastructure projects.  \n \n121.  Ethnic  Minority  Issues.  The  Program  will  implement  policy  measures  to  ensure  the \nprovision  of  essential  basic  services  to  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment has confirmed that the reforms will be applied nationally and no negative impacts on \nindigenous peoples will occur. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n122.  The Program is classified as category C in line with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). It is \nfocused  on  minimizing  the  effects  of  the  financial  crisis  on  the  most  vulnerable  segment  of  the \npopulation. Health, education, and broader social welfare policy measures will have positive effects \non  the  beneficiary  population  by  increasing  their  access  to  essential  basic  services  during  the \nfinancial  crisis  and  in  the  longer  term.  Any  concerns  about  negative  environmental  impacts  from \nthe increased use of medical services, including medication that will become more readily available \nas  a  result  of  the  program,  are  negligible.  Negative  environmental  impacts  arising  from \ninterventions  in  the  education  sector  are  also  negligible.  The  policy  measures  to  improve  the \nprofessional  expertise  in  environmental  and  social  safeguards  of  the  working  group  revising  the \nUlaanbaatar  master  plan  will  ensure  environmental  issues  are  increasingly  considered,  thereby \nminimizing  the  environmental  impact  of  future  improvements  to  essential  basic  services  in \nUlaanbaatar,  particularly  in  the  ger  areas.  Since  the  Program  is  category  C,  there  is  no  need  to \nconduct either an initial environmental examination or a strategic environmental assessment for the \nproposed Program. The environmental analysis is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n123.  High Expectations. The universalization of previously targeted welfare benefits was based \non promises made during election campaigns. From July 2006, at a time of rapid economic growth, \nall  households  with  children  under  18  years  became  accustomed  to  receiving  cash  grants.  The \nGovernment may face opposition to a plan to revert to targeted child benefits. There is a lack of a \nclear  consensus  on  this  issue in  the  government.  Promises  of  large  unconditional  cash  grants  of \nover MNT1 million for each Mongolian made by candidates in the recently concluded presidential \nelections  can  only  increase  public  opposition  to  targeted  conditional  transfers.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  through  concerted  policy  dialogue  with  other  donors  and  an  intense  education  and \nconsensus-building  initiative  targeting  members  of  parliament,  the  media,  civil  servants,  and  the \npublic. This will be done through TA provided to the Program. \n \n\n \n\n\f27        \n\n124.  Deepening  Macroeconomic  Instability.  If  the  Government  is  unable  to  implement  the \neconomic stabilization program agreed with the IMF or if the global economy recovers slowly, the \nmacroeconomic  situation  will  deteriorate,  which  will  have  negative  implications  for  the  social \nsectors. This risk will be mitigated by continuous high-level policy dialogue by ADB and other major \ndonors. \n \n125.  Overoptimistic  Expectations  of  Recovery.  The  price  of  copper  is  volatile.  Sudden \nincreases  (such  as  that  in  mid-April  2009)  can  easily  be  misinterpreted  as  a  sign  of  economic \nrecovery. There is a risk that targeting may be opposed in the expectation that small increases in \nminerals prices will be sustained and that the economy will recover. This risk will be mitigated by \nadvocacy work through the accompanying TA project to raise awareness among parliamentarians \nof the need for targeting to maintain long-term fiscal stability and savings. The policy dialogue that \nis  part  of  the  quarterly  macro  assessment  under  the  IMF  stand-by  arrangement  will  also  help  to \nmaintain the commitment of the Government to reform targeting. \n \n126.  Delays in Establishing the National Database of Poor Households. It will take time for \nthe  new  PMT  national  database  to  function  efficiently.  This  may  increase  the  reluctance  of  the \nMOECS,  the  MOH,  and  the  MSWL  to  adopt  PMT.  It  may  also  increase  the  reluctance  of  the \nParliament to approve a comprehensive overhaul of the social welfare system and to introduce and \nreform  targeting  measures  in  the  health,  health  insurance,  and  education  sectors.  A  delay  in \nestablishing the database may also postpone implementation of the medicard program. A transition \nstrategy is therefore needed, which will help to improve targeting (e.g. through creation of a list of \npeople  who  do  not  need  social  assistance)  until  the  PMT  and  the  national  database  become \navailable.  The  transition  strategy  will  be  part  of  the  plan  to  reform  social  welfare.  The \naccompanying  TA  and  the  ongoing  Food  and  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Project  will  help  to \naccelerate  the  development  of  the  PMT  by  field-testing  it,  collecting  information  on  households, \nand designing the national database. \n \nF. \n\nAssumptions  \n\n127.  Global  Economy  Recovers  in  the  Medium  Term. The Program is designed to pave the \nway  for  programs  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  the  poor,  including  access  to  health  care, \nmicronutrients,  and  schooling.  It  will  also  set  fundamental  reforms  and  planning  processes  in \nmotion that will, in the medium to long term, profoundly restructure the way social welfare benefits \nare provided. A key assumption is that the economy will start to recover in the medium term and, \nas a result, the fiscal gains from improved targeting will not be undermined by further increases in \nthe absolute number of poor. It is also assumed that many of the transient poor, made up mostly of \nunemployed workers, will find employment as the economy  recovers and will therefore no longer \nrequire social welfare benefits.  \n \n128.  National Database System Works Efficiently. It is assumed that the new PMT system will \nlay the foundation for a national registration system that can be managed with sufficient expertise \nand efficiency to detect significant variations in household socioeconomic status. When combined \nwith  transparent  and  participatory  grievance  and  appeal  mechanisms  at  the  local  level,  this  will \nminimize  inclusion  and  exclusion  errors.  It  is  assumed  that,  at  the  national  level,  there  will  be \nsufficient  budgetary  support  and  capacity  to  avoid  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  errors  that  are \notherwise likely to occur in a rapidly changing economy.    \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28       \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n129. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. The Government will:  \n \n(i) \n\nuse  the  counterpart  funds  to  (a)  finance  expenditures  for  the  Government\u2019s  general \ndevelopment purposes, and (b) support the adjustment costs of reforms to be initiated and \nimplemented under the Program; \nensure (a) proper and timely achievement, adoption, compliance, and implementation of the \nobjectives,  policies  and  actions  as  set  forth  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  and  the \naccompanying policy matrix; and (b) that the policies adopted and the actions taken as set \nforth in the Development Policy Letter and the accompanying policy matrix will continue to \nbe in full force and effect for the duration of the Program period and subsequently; \nkeep ADB informed of, and the Government and ADB will from time to time exchange views \non,  sector  issues  and  policy  reforms  that  may  be  considered  necessary  or  desirable, \nincluding  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  policies  and  actions  as  set  forth  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the accompanying policy matrix; \npromptly discuss with ADB problems and constraints encountered during implementation of \nthe  Program  and  appropriate  measures  to  overcome  or  mitigate  such  problems  and \nconstraints; \nkeep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral  or  bilateral  agencies  that \nhave  implications  for  the  implementation  of  the  Program,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an \nopportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  consider \nADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals; \ntake necessary measures to ensure certain minimum amount of expenditures are allocated \nwithin  the  state  budget  to  ensure  that  (a)  the  capitation  rates  in  2010  for  family  group \npractices and soum health centers, at minimum, remain equal to its 2008 level; and (b) the \nbenefit  level  of  the  CMP  per  child  in  2010  for  the  lowest  socio-economic  quintile,  at \nminimum, remains equal to its 2008 level;41 \nensure  that  the  Gender  Action  Plan  agreed  under  the  Program  will  be  implemented  in  a \ntimely manner; and  \nensure  that  guidelines  and  capacity  building  materials  on  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  policies  as  they  related  to  the  urban  master  plan  and  improvement  of  living \nconditions in ger areas will be prepared in compliance with (a) ADB's Environmental Policy \n(2002),  (b)  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  (c)  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998).   \n\nConditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n\n130.  Prior to the effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, the Government will: \n \n(i) \n\nhave the JICA Loan Agreement duly executed and delivered, and all conditions precedent \nto  its  effectiveness  (other  than  a  condition  requiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  Financing \nAgreement with ADB) fulfilled or arrangements satisfactory to ADB will have been made for \nthe fulfillment thereof within a period of time satisfactory to ADB; \nhave carried out all the first tranche policy measures under the Program to the satisfaction \nof ADB; \nhave established the Program Steering Committee to the satisfaction of ADB; and \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n41 The savings generated from targeting will ensure that the 2008 total child money program benefit level will at least be \n\nmaintained for the lowest socio-economic quintile in 2010. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n\f29        \n\nhave  established  the  Program  Support  Unit,  including  allocation  of  the  necessary  office \nspace and facilities, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nVIII.

The  crisis  is  likely  to  worsen  poverty. \nLessons \nincreased \nunemployment  and  poverty,  resulting  in  declines  in  education  and  health  outcomes.  Cash \ntransfers  played  a  critical  role  in  alleviating  poverty  in  the  wake  of  the  1997  crisis,  while \neducation,  nutrition,  and  healthcare  programs  helped  contain  the  emergence  of  long-term \nadverse effects.1  \n \n2. \nA  World  Bank  review  of  financial  crises  around  the  world  supports  these  findings  and \npoints to the importance of protecting selected social expenditures during economic downturns, \nparticularly  those  relating  to  nutrition  and  health  outcomes.  Conditional  cash  transfers  are  an \neffective  way  to  maintain  school  attendance  and  health  care  and  can  be  effectively  linked  to \nself-targeting  workfare  programs  such  as  public  works  programs.  Where  basic  needs  are  met \nthrough target programs, the World Bank review notes that political support is critical.2  \n \nA financial crisis can be a catalyst for making government\u2019s social support mechanisms \n3. \nmore effective. Because the crisis imposes fiscal constraints on expenditure, difficult decisions \nhave  to  be  made.  These  usually  entail  prioritizing  expenditures  and  building  efficiency  into \nexisting systems. The reforms need not be short term. They can pave the way for more effective \nlong-term measures that meet the basic needs of the poor. In this respect, better targeting can \nplay  a  key  role  in  improving  fiscal  sustainability  while  increasing  benefits  to  the  poorest \nsegments of society.  \n \nFood, health, education, employment, and basic living conditions are key basic needs to \n4. \nbe protected during crises, especially for the poor. While governmental responsibilities to meet \ncitizens' basic needs are divided among ministries, there is a vital common theme among them \nthat the Program addresses: targeting resources to those most in need. To this end, there is a \nneed  to  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  design,  test,  and  implement  a  nationwide  proxy \nmeans test (PMT). The outcome of this exercise will be a powerful targeting tool available to all \nsocial  sector  agencies.  This  appendix  summarizes  the  issues  facing  the  three  key  ministries \nmandated to provide for the basic needs of the poor\u2014the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor, \nthe  Ministry  of  Health,  and  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science\u2014in  view  of  the \nsignificant  budget  cuts  they  now  face.  It  discusses  the  issues  facing  the  urban  poor  and  their \nliving conditions in light of the financial crisis and budget reductions. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Assistance \n\n5. \nGeneral  Background.  Prior  to  Mongolia's  transition  into  a  market  economy,  the  state \nguaranteed all Mongolians of working age a job for life, living quarters, and upon retirement, a \npension. With the transition, these traditional state benefits fell away. Between 1990 and 1993, \nMongolia suffered a recession that caused massive layoffs in state enterprises. As the share of \nworkers  with  no  social  security  benefits  increased,  the  need  grew  for  a  social  safety  net  to \n                                                 \n1  UNICEF. 2008.

Policy \n\nResearch Working Paper 4779. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       35 \n\nprotect poor workers and their families. The Government's response was to establish an array of \nbenefits  of  three  main  types:  (i)  welfare  pensions  for  the  elderly  and  those  with  permanent \ndisabilities;  (ii)  child-related  allowances,  including  prenatal,  infant,  and  child  care  and  benefits \nfor large families, etc.; and (iii) social welfare services and concessions for the poor, disabled, \nelderly, war veterans, and heroes.3   \n \n6. \nWhile  the  new  system  helped  to  carry  many  Mongolian  households  through  difficult \ntimes, it was recognized as being too complex and having many redundancies. Further, many \nbenefits did not target poverty and the targeting mechanisms that did exist were subjective and \nopen  to  misuse.  The  World  Bank  estimates  that  as  much  as  70%  of  beneficiary  households \nwere not poor, and that 40% of poor households\u2014and 25% of the poorest households\u2014did not \nreceive any assistance.  \n \n7. \nDue to poor targeting and small benefit sizes, the impact on poverty of the post-transition \nsystem  was  considered  to  be  relatively  small. 4  The  lack  of  proper  targeting  caused  large \ninclusion and exclusion errors and placed a serious fiscal burden on the state. A key reason for \nintroducing  poor  targeting  is  that  the  post-transition  system  was  based  on  broad  official \ndefinitions of vulnerability, with over 20 defined categories of beneficiaries, including all children \nunder  16,  elderly  people,  mothers  with  newborns,  single  parents,  and  unemployed  people, \nirrespective of their socioeconomic status.5  \n \n8. \nLegal  Framework.  The  Government  Law  in  1993  established  the  Ministry  of  Social \nWelfare and Labor (MSWL) and the Social Welfare Law, 1995, established  the  legal  basis  for \nthe  current  social  welfare  system.  Amendments  to  the  Social  Welfare  Law  in  1997  and  1998 \ninstituted  the  management  and  organization  of  an  independent  social  welfare  system.  Further \namendments  and  revisions  to  the  Social  Welfare  Law  provided  the  legal  basis  for  the  current \npackage of social assistance, including the (i) Law on the Social Welfare for Elderly Persons; (ii) \nLaw on the Social Security for Persons with Disabilities; and (iii) Law on Allowances to Mothers \nand  Children  and  Monetary  Assistance  to  Mothers,  Children,  and  New  Families  and  Couples. \nThese  laws  define  the  current  types  and  coverage  of  social  welfare  pensions,  benefits,  and \nservices;  regulate  procedures  for  the  appropriation  and  administration  of  the  social  welfare \nfunds; and determine the structure and functions of social welfare institutions.  \n \n9. \nAn important aspect of the Social Welfare Law is that the eligibility requirements do not \ndistinguish between the poor and those with incomes above the poverty line. The amendments \nenacted in January 2008 revised the eligibility requirements for beneficiaries of welfare benefits, \nbut they did not include poverty criteria and thus did not address specifically targeting the poor. \n \n10. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  MSWL is responsible for social welfare, social insurance, \nand employment issues at the central level. There are two implementing agencies under MSWL, \nthe  State  Social  Insurance  General  Office  (SSIGO)  and  the  Labor  and  Social  Welfare  Office \n(LSWO).  These  agencies  have  representatives  responsible  for  delivering  services  locally. \nGovernors  of  all  local  governments 6  are  obliged  by  law  to  undertake  area-specific  social \nprotection activities. MSWL is responsible for developing national policies on women, children, \nyouths,  the  disabled,  and  the  elderly.  LSWO  is  responsible  for  delivering  social  welfare \n\n                                                 \n3 World  Bank.  2008.

The  types  of  social  welfare  assistance \nprovided through LSWO include  (i)  in-kind services such as residential facilities for the elderly \nand the disabled and services for the poor, homeless, and children; (ii) discounts and subsidies \nfor the elderly, the disabled, and other groups to reduce the costs of housing and health care; \n(iii) short-term cash benefits for pregnancy delivery, child care, families with many children, the \nadoption  of  orphans,  and  infant  care;  and  (iv)  long-term  pensions  for  those  not  eligible  for \nSSIGO assistance.  \n \nPublic  service  agencies  employ  1,200  social  workers,  798  of  whom  work  for  social \n11. \nwelfare agencies, with 510 of them employed at the lowest administrative level of the soum or \nkhoroo. Soums and khoroos with large populations recruit social worker assistants to help with \nthe  workload.  The  remaining  624  are  employed  by  schools,  law  enforcement  agencies,  and \nhospitals.  About  20%  have  a  social  work  degree.  Recently,  social  welfare  officers7 have  been \nrecruited to support social workers in areas with large populations. Livelihood support councils \nhave been created to facilitate social welfare outreach and assist in ensuring the identification \nand validation of needy recipients. Although the councils are in place, there are few guidelines \nor resources for staff and little training.   \n \n12. \nRecent Reforms and Revisions of Reform. The Government adopted a social security \nsector master plan8 in 2003 as a framework for the long-term development of the sector.9 This \nspelled out the main objectives of reform as (i) rationalizing the number and type of benefits, (ii) \nclarifying  eligibility  criteria  for  benefits  to  improve  the  quality  and  accessibility  of  services,  (iii) \ndecentralizing  the  management  of  social  assistance  services,  (iv)  professionalizing  the  social \nwelfare  officers  in  charge  of  implementing  social  assistance,  and  (v)  promoting  community \nparticipation in specific care provider institutions. \n  \n13. \nThe  2003  master  plan  paved  the  way  for  the  introduction,  in  January  2005,  of  a \nconditional cash transfer that targeted poor households with children aged 0\u201318. Known as the \nchild money program (CMP), it introduced for the first time a PMT that used a set of objective \nindicators  to  identify  the  poor.  The  cash  transfers  were  then  conditioned  on  children  being \nimmunized,  living  with  parents,  not  being  engaged  in  intolerable  forms  of  child  labor,  and,  for \nchildren  aged  8\u201318,  being  enrolled  in  school.  In  essence,  the  CMP  sought  to  replace  the  old \nsystem  of  local  authorities'  subjective  assessment  of  poverty,  with  an  objective  test  based  on \nknown criteria.  \n \n14. \nIn July 2006, just 18 months after its introduction, the CMP was universalized under an \namendment  to  the  Social  Welfare  Law.  Now  all  families  with  children  under  18  years  could \nreceive  CMP  benefits.  At  the  same  time,  all  child-related  allowances  other  than  CMP  were \nconsolidated  into  a  single  conditional  cash  transfer  of  MNT20,000  per  month.  This  increased \nMSWL expenditures by 61%. In January 2007, the CMP benefit was increased from MNT36,000 \nper  child  per  year  to  MNT136,000.  This  was  made  possible  by  the  newly  established \ndevelopment  fund  built  up  from  the  windfall  tax  on  copper  and  gold  production.  At  the  same \ntime,  two  large  one-time  allowances  were  introduced:  MNT500,000  for  newlyweds  and \nMNT100,000  for  newborns.  Expenditure  shot  up  by  173%  to  equal  11.9%  of  the  budget  and \n5.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Within  a  year,  this  swept  aside  early  efforts  to  target \nbenefits to poor households, turning a social welfare benefit for the needy into a mechanism for \n                                                 \n7   Social welfare officers tend not to have as much formal training as social workers.  \n8  The social security sector strategy paper was developed in 2001 with technical and financial assistance from ADB. \n\nThe master plan was adopted in 2003. \n\n9   Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor.  2003.

In all, the coverage of social welfare benefits \nincreased  by  7.6  times  from  2004  to  2007.  The  number  of  beneficiaries  receiving  conditional \ncash benefits increased by 3.6 times from 2006 to 2007.  \n \nChallenges.  The  global  economic  downturn  has  severely  constrained  government \n15. \nrevenue in Mongolia. The decline in proceeds from minerals created a precarious fiscal situation \nfor  the  social  welfare  sector,  which  depended  on  it  to  support  the  CMP,  the  largest  social \nassistance  benefit.  The  main  causes  of  the  deficit  are  identified  as  large  social  transfers  and \nconsumption outstripping GDP growth.10 With the fiscal crisis, the Government had to cut back \non expenditure, reducing the 2009 amended budget for social welfare services by 18.6% from \nthe  approved  budget.  Recurrent  expenditures  will  be  reduced  by  20%,  affecting  the \nadministration and operation budget of the ministry. But the largest cuts will be made to \u201cgoods \nand services.\u201d The following universal programs will be reduced by the proportions indicated: (i) \nthe pregnant or feeding mother\u2019s benefit by 12.8%, (ii) the newlywed program by 38%, and (iii) \nthe CMP by 33% (a cut of MNT47 billion out of MNT142 billion). \n \nThe  across-the-board  cut  in  the  CMP  will  affect  the  poor  disproportionately  as  many \n16. \ndepend  almost  entirely  on  these  payments  for  their  daily  subsistence.  However,  the  current \ncrisis  environment  provides  an  opportunity  to  reform  the  social  assistance  system  so  that  (i) \nnon-poor households can be removed from the list, (ii) benefits can be increased to those who \nremain,  and  (ii)  the  heretofore  unreached  poor  can  be  included.  Rationalizing  the CMP  in  this \nway  can  provide  large  savings,  as  it  is  the  largest  social  benefit  awarded  to  the  public.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  estimates  that  converting  the  CMP  into  a  targeted  benefit \ncan save MNT61,033 million. Targeting other social benefits more efficiently can save another \nMNT12,206  million.11 With  these  savings,  the  Government  could  raise  benefits  and  improve \ntargeting  methodology  and  monitoring.  The  impact  on  the  budget  is  expected  to  be  neutral  or \npossibly positive.  \n \nThe Government will face both political and technical challenges in reforming the current \n17. \nsocial welfare system. In the last few years, Mongolians have become accustomed to universal \nbenefits so reforms to improve the targeting of social welfare programs will be limited by public \nsensitivities,  popular  expectations,  and  political  demands.  Reluctance  to  undertake  targeting \ncan also be attributed to the lack of capacity or knowledge of targeting mechanisms or workable \nmodels. Although the financial crisis has highlighted the need for targeting, support will need to \nbe gained from politicians and wider public. \n \nThe  exclusion  from  social  welfare  benefits  of  households  who  have  not  managed  to \n18. \ncomplete civil registration, for whatever reason, needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, \nas a large proportion of them are very poor. Several programs are working on this and updating \nthe  civil  registration  records.  Any  program  designed  to  address  social  assistance  data \nmanagement will need to consider these developments. \n \n19. \nCurrently,  social  assistance  includes  48  programs  and  156  types  of  social  services. \nMany  programs  overlap.  The  absence  of  an  effective,  centrally  operated  management \ninformation system allows duplication of benefits and other programmatic inefficiencies. Unless \n\n                                                 \n10 World Bank. 2009. Mongolia Quarterly Report. Washington, DC (February). \n11 IMF. 2009. Mongolia Public Expenditure Review. Ulaanbaatar. The elimination of universal benefits to those  who \ndo not depend on them for well-being provides an additional avenue for potential savings. Under the current Social \nWelfare Law of 2006, the Mongolian government awards four different types of universal benefits to citizens; child \nmoney, the newlywed benefit, newborn benefit, and the benefit given to pregnant women. In 2008, these benefits \namounted to MNT147.97 billion. \n\n \n\n\f38      Appendix 2 \n\nthe fragmentation of the social assistance system is addressed, it will be difficult to make it more \nefficient.  Fragmentation  became  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  on  reforming  social  welfare  only \nrecently, and resolving it will require advocacy and effective public communication. \n \nC. \n\nHealth  \n\n20. \nBackground.  During  the  socialist  era,  Mongolia  established  a  Semashko-style  health \nsystem,  with  centralized  and  fully  subsidized  state  health  services  provided  through  an \ninefficient  health  care  system  with  a  large  hospital  subsector  but  poorly  developed  primary \nhealth care (PHC) facilities. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the early 1980s, Mongolia\u2019s \nhealth  care  system  experienced  substantial  regulatory,  structural,  and  financial  changes  to \naddress  the  challenges  of  the  new  regime.  The  changes  included  the  emergence  of  private \nhealth  care  providers,  the  privatization  of  government  facilities,  the  establishment  of  family \ngroup practices (FGPs), reductions in the number of specialists in favor of a higher number of \ngeneral  practitioners,  and  changes  in  the  salary  system  to  one  based  on  capitation.  More \ndiversified health-financing mechanisms were established, including private funding and a social \nhealth insurance system. \n \n21. \nInstitutional Arrangements. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is the Government\u2019s central \nadministrative  body  responsible  for  health  policy  formulation,  planning,  coordination  and \nsupervision,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  as  well  as  for  ensuring  the  implementation  of \nhealth-related  activities  and  standards  through  its  health  facilities  and  agencies.  MOH  has \nbranch offices in each of the 22 local administrative areas (aimags or city health departments).  \n \nHealth services are provided through public and private facilities at three levels. PHC is \n22. \nfully subsidized from state budget and provided through bag feldshers (village health workers) in \nremote rural areas12 and soum health centers13 (SHCs) and inter-soum hospitals in rural villages \nand FGPs14 in aimag centers and Ulaanbaatar.15 At the secondary level, there are 21 secondary \nlevel  referral  institutions  in  the  aimag  centers  and  district  general  hospitals.16 At  the  tertiary \nlevel,  specialty  care  is  provided  through  national  level  institutions  of  general  and  specialized \ncenters in Ulaanbaatar and regional diagnostic and treatment centers in three regions.  \n\n \n\n23.  Mongolia has one doctor per 10,000 residents, which is one of the world's highest ratios, \nhigher  than  even  the  developed  country  average.  According  to  2005  health  statistics,  the \nphysician-to-nurse  ratio  was  1  to  1.2.  Although  the  health  sector  aims  to  take  a  public  health-\noriented  approach,  the  skills  mix  does  not  reflect  the  main  principles  of  this  policy.  The \npercentage  of  PHC  practitioners  who  work  as  gatekeepers  is  too  low,  and  the  number  of \nspecialized  professionals  has  been  growing.  The  hospital  sector  is  still  large  and  inefficient, \nproviding low-quality care. \n \nHealth  Financing  and  Expenditure.  The  health  sector  is  funded  from  four  main \n24. \nsources.  They  are  general  taxation,  social  health  insurance  fund,  overseas  development \nassistance,  and  out-of-pocket  payments.  In  2002,  the  first  Mongolian  national  health  accounts \nstudy  estimated  that  71%  of  the  health  expenditure  was  financed  by  government  general \n\n                                                 \n12 Where most herders live. \n13 There are 288 soum health centers and 35 intersoum hospitals, and 229 FGPs in Mongolia. \n14 Despite the uncertainty of FGPs' legal status, the initial design is kept as private health care providers. \n15 Each soum hospital has at least one doctor, a midwife, and additional support service staff. FGPs have 3\u20135 doctors \n\nas well as nurses and additional support staff. \n16 These hospitals operate with at least 200 beds. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       39 \n\nrevenue and social health insurance, 15% by private sources,17 13% by overseas development \nassistance,  and  1%  by  community  contributions.  There  is  growing  concern  that  out-of-pocket \npayment has been increasing and becoming a bigger burden on household spending, especially \nfor  the  poor.  According  to  a  World  Bank  2009  report,  the  share  of  private  spending  increased \nfrom  23%  to  37%  between  1998  and  2004,  with  most  of  this  taking  the  form  of  out-of-pocket \npayments  by  2004.  This  has  increasingly  raised  financial  barriers  to  those  seeking  care  and \ngreater exposure to financial risk. \n \nCompared with most other low-income countries, Mongolia has historically had relatively \n25. \nhigh health expenditure, equivalent to about 3.0%\u20134.5% of GDP and 10\u201312% of all government \nexpenditure. 18  Government  health  expenditure  increased  during  the  years  of  sustained \neconomic growth from 2006 to 2008, almost doubling in nominal terms from MNT103.1 billion to \nMNT 229.1 billion. Over the past decade, the Government has accounted for two thirds of health \nexpenditure, with just over half going through social health insurance (SHI).  \n \n26. \nSHI  was  created  as  an  integral  part  of  the  health  financing  system  in  1994  to  raise \nadditional  resources  for  the  health  sector.  It  is  one  of  five  components  of  the  broader  social \nsecurity  system  administered  by  SSIGO.  Employees  and  employers  each  pay  2%  of  salaries, \nfor a total of 4%. The Government directly pays the contributions of people who are unable to \npay  or  otherwise  considered  vulnerable  as  well  as  a  flat  monthly  premium  of  MNT500  for \nchildren  under  16,  people  whose  only  income  is  a  pension,  people  on  parental  leave,  military \npersonnel  on  active  duty,  and  others  as  specified  in  the  Social  Welfare  Law.  Self-employed \nherders,  students  and  unemployed  people  are  responsible  for  their  own  contributions,  paying \nMNT500 per month. The definitions of vulnerability have changed over time and are not based \non income vulnerability criteria. Over the years, the state-subsidized group has risen from 50% \nof the population to 65%.  \n\n \n27. \nSHI is compulsory in Mongolia and normally provides universal coverage reaching 97% \nin  1996  but  slipping  to  77%  in  2007, 19  mainly  because  of  lower  state  subsidies  for  such \ncategories as herders and students and, to some extent, to declining public confidence in health \ninsurance benefits. Most SHI expenditure\u201478% in 2007\u2014has been geared to hospital inpatient \ncare provided at the tertiary level.  \n\n \n28. \nThe SHI fund is increasingly out of balance. In 2007, employees contributed 76% of total \nSHI  revenue  but  account  for  13%  of  total  expenditure.  State  subsidy  to  SHI  is  25%  of  total \nrevenue  but  their  use  of  services  results  to  60%  of  total  expenditure.  This  may  show  social \nsolidarity and risk pooling for the sick and needy at the expense of the healthy and well-off, but \nthe  poor  quality  of  care  and  increasing  out-of-pocket  payments  at  hospitals,  coupled  with \nbureaucracy and other systemic issues, has created dissatisfaction among the insured.  \n \nPerformance of the Health Sector. The performance of the health system in Mongolia \n29. \nhas  shown  mixed  results.  Life  expectancy  at  birth  is  66  years  only,  slightly  lower  than  in \nMongolia's East Asian neighbors.20 Mongolia will likely be among the few developing countries \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. From 1996 to 2006, the prevalence of measles, \nmumps, and rubella decreased from 170 to 70 per 100,000 live births; the infant mortality rate \n\n                                                 \n17 The 2002 National Health Account did not capture overseas treatment costs. \n18 World  Bank.  2006.

Communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted \ninfections remain serious concerns. Tuberculosis prevalence increased from 79 per 100,000 in \n1990 to 155 per 100,000 in 2003 and 185 per 100,000 in 2006.  \n \n30.  Mortality  rates  are  five  times  higher  among  the  poorest  20%  of  the  population  than \namong the richest 20%. Tuberculosis and other conditions are strongly associated with poverty, \nas most patients are unemployed and either poor or very poor. Micronutrient malnourishment is \na  real  concern,  with  one-third  of  children  under-5  suffering  from  rickets,  and  one-half  from \nanemia. An additional concern is that malnutrition remains strongly associated with poverty, with \nthe children of poor families three times more likely to suffer from malnourishment and nine out \nof  10  malnourished  children  being  from  poor  rural  families.  These  disparities,  though  not \nunusual  by  international  standards,  point  to  persistent  challenges  in  reaching  vulnerable  and \nhigh-risk groups with information and services.22 \n\n \nLower  health  outcomes  for  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  reflect  the  high  cost  of  health \n31. \nservices. In theory, the health insurance contributions of the poor are paid by the state, PHC is \nfully subsidized, and the poor are exempt from hospital copayments and official user charges. \nHowever,  access  for  the  poor  to  inter-soum  hospitals  is  restricted  by  patient  fees,  including \ncharges  for  drugs  and  food.  Out-of-pocket  payment  to  all  health  facilities  has  been  a  major \nobstacle to accessing health services, especially for poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n32. \nOfficial  copayments  in  particular  are  a  major  barrier  for  the  poor.  Patients  are  often \nexpected to contribute 30\u201350% copayment for drugs prescribed by primary care doctors. This is \nespecially burdensome to the poor people who use these facilities the most. At the secondary \nlevel,  10%  copayment  is  expected  for  inpatient  care  and,  at  the  tertiary  level,  15%.  Children \nunder  16,  pregnant  women,  women  above  55,  men  above  60  years,  and  invalids  are \nsupposedly  exempted  from  official  user  charges  and  their  expenses  are  covered  by  the  state. \nHowever, in reality this policy is often not applied. As a result, health service usage is some 2.5 \ntimes lower for the poor than for the non-poor, resulting in much lower health outcomes.  \n \n33. \nMNT23.0 billion lower than approved, as shown in Table A2. \n \n\nChallenges.

In relation \nto this, the key concerns and changes required in the health sector are summarized below. \n \n35. \nBecause of the cuts, expenditures on drugs and medical supplies have been reduced by \n20%,  or  MNT5.9  billion.  This  is  a  severe  cut  in  the  context  of  rising  international  prices  and a \ndepreciating national currency. This combination of the factors may create further shortages of \nessential  drugs  and  supplies.  Without  appropriate  mechanisms  or  preparedness  nationally  for \nemergencies,  hospitals  are  likely  to  struggle  to  maintain  the  uninterrupted  provision  of  health \nservices.  \n \n36.  Micronutrient  deficiencies  can  easily  develop  during  times  of  economic hardship,  when \npoorer  households  cut  back  on  food  expenditure,  increasing  the  general  risk  of  infectious \nillness.23 Evidence from other developing countries confirms that rapid increases in food prices \nand food insecurity lead to rapid increases in maternal and child under-nutrition levels. In many \ninstances  mothers  act  as  buffers  and  bear  the  consequences  of  qualitative  change  in  dietary \nintake and under-nutrition in an effort to protect their children. The effects are particularly severe \nfor babies conceived and weaned during a crisis.24 \n \nAlthough Mongolian society aims, in theory, to  provide free health services to the poor \n37. \nand  disadvantaged,  many  of  the  poor  are  left  out  of  the  system  and  face  difficulty  getting  the \nhealth services they need. Despite efforts to make SHI universal, it fails to cover almost 20% of \nthe population, many of whom are poor. Street children, the unemployed, and the homeless are \nlikely  to  be  denied  health  insurance  for  lack  of  civil  registration.  Although  the  state  subsidizes \nthe  health  insurance  contribution  of  almost  60%  of  population,  many  of  the  real  poor  are \nexcluded  while  many  non-poor  are  included.  This  diminishes  how  effectively  the  policy  can \nprotect  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  by  targeting  limited  resources  to  the  needy.  There  is  an \nurgent need to appropriately target the state subsidy to SHI to the real poor.  \n \n38. \nThere  is  substantial  inefficiency  in  the  health  sector.  Evidence  suggests  that  clinically \nunnecessary hospitalization is common in Mongolia. The share of SHI expenditure for outpatient \nand  PHC,  which  are  recognized  as  the  most  cost-effective  approaches,  continues  to  be  very \nlow.  Over  the  years,  SHI  expenditures  for  drug  price  discounts  for  insured  patients  has \nremained  at  about  2%,  without  increasing  even  during  the  years  of  economic  expansion. \nWithout effective mechanisms to expand the provision of essential medicines to PHC users, a \nreduction  of  hospitalization  is  unlikely  to  materialize.  In  addition,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to \nimprove services of PHC providers to the poor, who are its primary users. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2009.

In  the  mid-1990s,  during  the  transition  period,  school  attendance  in \nMongolia was poor, many schools were dysfunctional, and teachers were not paid for months.25 \nToday,  Mongolia  ranks  high  among  comparator  countries  in  terms  of  school  enrolment  and \ncompletion.  In  the  2007/2008  school  year,  the  enrollment  rate  for  primary  school  was  92.7%; \nwhile  the  secondary  school  rate  was  86.8%.  The  completion  rate  of  77%  exceeds  those  of \nThailand (67%), Viet Nam (56%), and Indonesia (43%). \n \n40. \nThese  achievements  follow  a  systematic  restructuring  of  education  institutions  carried \nout  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded  Education  Sector  Development  Project. \nThis aimed to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the education system during the \n1990s, the most severe period of transition. A nationwide school mapping study was completed \nin  April  1997,  and  a  plan  was  prepared  for  comprehensive  school  rationalization.  Of  the  171 \nschools identified for restructuring, 136, or 80%, were restructured by August 1998 and 35, or \n20%, were restructured by June 2002. This paved the way for new investments in education by \nthe state and private sector across the country. \n \n41. \nBy  2007/2008  there  were  754  general  education  schools  in  Mongolia  with  a  total  of \n542,505 students. According to Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MOECS) statistics, \n23,778  teachers  were  employed  in  general  education  schools,  of  which  22,891  were  fulltime. \nThe  average  teacher-to-student  ratio  is  25.5  (footnote  25).  The  shortage  of  teachers  in \n2006/2007 was 479, with the highest number of vacancies in Ulaanbaatar. Of the 754 general \neducation schools in 2007/2008, 210 were in Ulaanbaatar and the remainder were in aimags. Of \nthe total, 71 schools were primary only, 167 had grades 1\u201310, and 516 had grades 1\u201311. Most \nschools  taught  in  Mongolian,  though  in  Bayan-Olgiy  schools  offered  instruction  in  Kazakh. \nPrivate firms owned 20% of schools. \n \nChallenges. Because of the low population density and nomadic lifestyle of many rural \n42. \nareas,  boarding  schools  play  a  critical  role  in  the  education  system.  A  total  of  495  boarding \nschools  enrolled  44,037  students  in  2007/2008,  or  8%  of  the  student  population,  of  which \n38,255  were  herders\u2019  children.  Overall,  51,118  students  wanted  to  live  in  dormitories,  but \ndemand exceeded supply, and many students were forced to live in rented accommodation or \nwith  relatives.  The  costs  of  maintaining  small  rural  schools  and  boarding  schools  are  high. \nMaintaining  sufficient  heating  is  critical  and  expensive,  with  15%  of  the  national  education \nbudget going to that alone. The extreme winter climate presents challenges for young children. \nOnly  half  of  Mongolian  children  receive  any  form  of  early  childhood  education, 26  and  the \nenrollment of children in rural areas and children from herder families in preschool programs is \nparticularly low. \n \nInternal  migration  from  rural  to  urban  areas  presents  challenges  to  MOECS.  In  remote \n43. \nrural areas, MOECS has to contend with falling pupil numbers and rising per capita costs, while \nin  urban  areas,  notably  in  Ulaanbaatar,  internal  migration  places  considerable  pressure  on \nschool  infrastructure.  Many  schools  now  operate  in  shifts  and  pupil-teacher  ratios  are  on  the \nrise. \n \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2007. Program Performance Evaluation Report on the Education Sector Development Program in Mongolia. \n\n26 Nettleton,  Steve.  2007.  Traveling  Schools  Bring  Education \n\nto  Migrant \n\n'Herder  Children'.  Available: \n\nwww.unicef.org/infobycountry/mongolia_40960.html. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       43 \n\nThe  Constitution  stipulates  free  basic  education  for  all  children,  but  there  are  many \n44. \nformal and informal costs that are barriers to access. Poverty has a significant impact on school \nattendance. Even prior to the financial crisis, the costs of education paid by parents, including \ntextbooks, stationery, school uniforms, and travel to school, were major concerns.  Past surveys \nshowed that textbooks were the highest education expenditure for households. For the poorest \nsegment of the population, textbook expense account for over 50% of educational expenditures. \nIn theory, the Government provides textbooks to 20% of the students who are deemed poor, but \nboth coverage and targeting are reported to fall short. Only 9% of students have received free \ntextbooks, and there appears to be significant leakage to the non-poor. \n \n45. \nIn  addition  to  finding  ways  of  reducing  financial  barriers  to  education,  MOECS  has  to \nconsider  how  to  reform  the  curriculum  and  teaching  methods.  In  a  fast-changing  economy, \nchildren  need  to  be  prepared  to  think  critically  and  creatively.  Unfortunately,  the  Mongolian \ncurriculum and teaching methods have not kept up with new demands in the labor market. The \ncurriculum  continues  to  be  highly  theoretical  and  focused  on  traditionally  academic  subjects, \nwhile  teaching  continues  to  be  teacher-centered  rather  than  interactive.  It  encourages \nmemorization  rather  than  critical  and  creative  thinking,  and  individual  learning  rather  than \nteamwork.  While  information  and  communication  technology  and  English  language  are  part  of \nthe curriculum, teachers are generally not well prepared to teach these subjects. In many cases, \nthe teaching of information and communications technology is limited by the low availability of \ncomputers in schools and inadequate operational budgets.  \n \n46. \nThe teaching of thinking and behavioral skills needs to be integrated into every aspect of \nthe  curriculum  through  discovery-oriented  teaching  methods  that  include  interactive  learning, \napplying  knowledge  to  real-life  problems,  integrating  teamwork  and  peer  tutoring  into  the \nlearning  process,  and  inviting  student  input  into  the  structure  and  subject  matter  of  lessons. \nHowever,  these  methodologies  require  trained  teachers  and  adequate  classroom  facilities  to \nmake them effective.  \n \n47. \nThe  implementation  of  student-centered  learning  will  take  time  and  require  substantial \ninvestments  in  pre-  and  in-service  training.  In  the  short  run,  teaching  life  skills  as  a  separate \nsubject  (e.g.,  health,  citizenship,  or  financial  literacy  education)  may  be  a  practical  option.  To \nimprove teaching, teachers need adequate materials and should conduct routine assessments \nof student progress, focusing on their ability to use the knowledge acquired.  \n \n48. \nRecent  Reforms.  Recent reforms have seen major shifts in primary education. Before \n2004/2005, Mongolia had a 10-year school system. In that year, an eleventh year was added. In \nthe  2008/2009  school  year,  the  system  moved  to  a  12-year  system,  with  school  entry  age \nlowered from 7 to 6. This brought 43,000 6-year-olds into the formal education system in 2008, \nplacing significant pressure on the budget. The particular challenges faced in this regard include \nthe  need  for  (i)  additional  classroom,  kitchen,  and  dormitory  facilities  appropriate  for  young \nchildren;  (ii)  training  for  teachers  in  new  skills  and  teaching  methods  for  early  childhood \neducation;  (iii)  curriculum  amendment  to  accommodate  6-year-olds;  and  (iv)  new  learning  and \nteaching materials and supplementary reading books. \n \n49. \nNew  teaching  methods  have  been  developed  and  tested  in  pilot  (or  model)  schools  in \ncollaboration  with  educational  institutes.  The  new  methods  have  been  piloted  for  3  years  by \nMOECS in collaboration with universities and institutes. To provide practice in the new methods, \na  set  of  24  teachers\u2019  guidebooks  covering  eight  subjects  has  been  developed  and  made \navailable to model schools. A joint evaluation conducted by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) and MOECS in March 2009 found the following: (i) the project responded to the \n\n \n\n\f44      Appendix 2 \n\npriorities of Mongolian education policy and the needs of classroom teachers; (ii) the methods \nenable  children  to  construct  and  acquire  knowledge  by  themselves;  and  (iii)  the  project \nsuccessfully  brought  together  university  teachers,  aimag  or  city  supervisors,  and  teachers  to \ndevelop  the  teachers\u2019  guidebooks.  It  was  recommended  that  an  action  plan  be  developed \nfocusing on how to sustain the project activities and disseminate the new teaching methods. \n \n50. \nEducation  and  the  Financial  Crisis.  Until  the  onset  of  the  financial  crisis,  the \nGovernment  was  able  to  draw  on  its  growing  revenues  to  finance  significant  increases  in \nexpenditure in education. Expenditure on education, culture, and science in 2008 was approved \nat MNT386.6 billion, an increase of MNT151.8 billion, or 65%, over 2007. The original budget for \n2009,  approved  by  Parliament  in  2008,  was  MNT432,980  billion,  a  14%  increment  over  2008. \nHowever, with the onset of the crisis, the budget was amended to MNT386 billion, back to the \n2008  level.  Cuts  in  recurrent  costs  have  primarily  affected  salaries,  wages,  and  related \nexpenditures, which have been reduced by 9.1%. Others cuts of such line items as stationery, \nelectricity,  heating,  and  transportation  are  by  22.3%.  Budget  cuts  will  require  rephasing  the \nconstruction of schools, dormitories, and kindergartens. The crisis will severely curtail expansion \nplans for primary schools. In the context of the expenditure requirements brought about by the \nexpansion of the school system to 12 years, this has serious implications.  \n \n51. \nThe ongoing economic crisis and budget cuts threaten the achievement of sector goals. \nThe  more  immediate  concerns  affecting  education  during  the  crisis  are  increases  in  (i) \nunemployment (and a consequent decrease in income for parents and guardians); (ii) parents \nunable  to  afford  school  textbooks;  (iii)  school  dropout  rates  and  the  number  of  out-of-school \nchildren,  especially  in  poor  communities;  (iv)  child  labor  to  compensate  for  falling  household \nincomes  (further  increasing  school  dropout  rates);  and  (v)  urban  migration  (resulting  in  more \nurban  schools  having  to  teach  in  shifts  to  accommodate  rising  numbers  of  students).  The \nprovision  of  kindergarten  meals  and  textbooks  and  lunches  for  secondary  school  students  will \nalleviate some financial burden faced by vulnerable families during the crisis.  \n \n52. \nOpportunities.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  is  not  alone  in  its  efforts  to  meet  the \neducational challenges described above. Education has received external assistance since the \nearly  1990s.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  a  major  bilateral  donor,  providing  grants  for \nrenovating  and  upgrading  primary  and  secondary  schools,  strengthening  teacher  training,  and \ninformation and communication technology in education. ADB continues to support educational \nreforms  through  concessional  loans  and  technical  assistance.  The  Government  has  signed  a \ncompact  with  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation,  part  of  which  will  be  devoted  to  developing \nvocational training. Under the Education for All Fast Track Initiative of the World Bank and ADB, \nMOECS is improving access to basic education and enhancing the quality of its services. The \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  World  Vision  are  active  in  preschool,  primary,  and \nsecondary education, while the European Commission and Save the Children United Kingdom \nsupport  quality  preschool  and  basic  education.  German  technical  cooperation  provides \nassistance for demand-oriented vocational training in cooperation with ADB and the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction.  \n \nOverall, external assistance to education sector development has significantly increased \n53. \nin the past few years mostly in the form of grants. To enhance harmonization and coordination \nand improve the efficiency of external assistance, the Government and its development partners \nagreed to establish a sector-wide approach for education. The Education Donors\u2019 Consultative \nMechanism is now fully operational and co-chaired by ADB and the Government of Japan. The \nProgram  will  support  reforms  that  will  bring  improvements  in  teaching  methods  and  pave  the \nway for a project that will provide textbooks to the poor. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       45 \n\nE. \n\nUrban Planning  \n\n54. \nGeneral  Background.  Mongolia  has  a  population  of  2.6  million,  40%  of  which  lives  in \nUlaanbaatar, which continues to experience an accelerating influx of migrants from other parts \nof the country. Annual growth rates between 1998 and 2007 averaged 3.7%, with the population \nof  the  city  growing  from  715,000  to  1,031,000  and  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  share  of  the  national \npopulation increasing from 30.5% to 39.1%. The in-migrants have largely settled in ger districts, \nwhich now house over 60% of the city\u2019s population. \n \n55. \nThe residents of the ger districts lack proper housing, access to water, sanitation, roads, \nutilities, and other infrastructure. Ger residents live either in gers (traditional felt tents) or in self-\nbuilt  wooden  houses.  While  the  average  household  monthly  income  of  Ulaanbaatar  is \nMNT217,000/household/month,  in  the  ger  districts it  is  MNT180,000/household/month,  or  20% \nless.27 Although incomes of ger households are lower than those of households in other areas \nof  the  city,  there  are  cases  where  ger  households  pay  more  for  water  and  coal  because  of \nlimited connection to infrastructure and urban utilities. \n \n56. \nThe  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban  Development \n(MRTCUD)  is  responsible  for  urban  policy  development,  and  the  Municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar \n(MUB)  is  responsible  for  the  hands-on  implementation  of  the  city\u2019s  development. 28 The  Urban \nPlanning,  Research,  and  Design  Institute  is  an  independent  public  organization  originally \nestablished for formulating the 2001 Ulaanbaatar city master plan and is responsible for urban \nplanning.   \n \n57.  MUB executes its responsibilities through the departments of Environmental Protection, \nLabor  and  Social  Welfare,  Land  Administration,  Police,  Professional  Monitoring,  Public \nTransportation,  Roads  and  Transport,  Traffic  Police,  and  Urban  Development.  The  Urban \nDevelopment  and  Land  Administration  departments  are  responsible  for  redeveloping  and \nimproving living standards in ger districts. MUB is responsible for the detailed guidelines that will \ngovern  the  day-to-day  work  of  officers  involved  in  the  upgrading.  A  multidisciplinary  working \ngroup on ger district development has been established to provide oversight. \n \nLegal  Framework.  Major  laws  related  to  urban  planning  are  the  Urban  Development \n58. \nLaw,  1988;  Land  Law,  2002;  and  Housing  Law.  The  Urban  Development  Law  established  the \nlegal basis for urban development, and amendments in 2008 laid down approval procedures for \nurban development plans and stipulated a zoning system as the basis of effective land use and \nurban  development.  Sub-procedures,  rules  of  enforcement,  and  ordinances  are  still  being \nformulated.  The  Land  Law  and  the  Law  on  Allocation  of  Land  to  Mongolian  Citizens  for \nOwnership, 2002, laid down the basis for the land tenure system. A land ownership allowance of \n700  square  meters  per  household  was  later  amended  to  700  square  meters  per  person, \naccelerating unregulated expansion of the ger area. \n \n59. \nThe Housing Law of Mongolia regulates planning and designing issues of housing. One \nof the problems of housing in Ulaanbaatar is that apartment units can be purchased only by the \nhigher-middle and high income groups. The master plan study addresses the need to review the \nlaw  in  view  of  establishing  a  financial  mechanism  to  help  low-income  groups  improve  their \nhousing. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n27 Ministry of Roads, Transportation, Construction, and Urban Development; Municipality of Ulaanbaatar; JICA. 2009. \n\nStudy on City Master Plan and Urban Development Program of Ulaanbaatar City.

The  Ulaanbaatar  city  master  plan  was  formulated  by  the  Urban \n60. \nPlanning, Research, and Design Institute in 2001 and adopted in 2003 as the framework for the \nlong-term  development  of  Ulaanbaatar,  targeting  2020.  The  Ulaanbaatar  city  master  plan  had \nnot taken into consideration rapid population growth or the rapid expansion of ger districts and \nwas  seen  as  inadequate.  MRTCUD  and  MUB  have  conducted,  with  technical  assistance  from \nJICA,  the  Study  on  City  Master  Plan  and  Urban  Development  Program  of  Ulaanbaatar  City to \nformulate  an  updated  city  master  plan  targeting  2030.29 The  master  plan  study  addresses  the \nneed  for  establishing  a  legal  system  for  urban  planning  and  development,  a  proper  zoning \nsystem,  and  participatory  planning  methodologies  to  achieve  the  comprehensive  improvement \nof living conditions in Ulaanbaatar, including the ger districts.   \n \n61. \nIt  is  essential  that  the  Ulaanbaatar  city  master  plan  be  revised  in  line  with  the  master \nplan  study  and  approved  by  the  Parliament  to  be  effective  for  actual  city  planning  and \ndevelopment.  MRTCUD  and  MUB  will  be  responsible  for  setting  up  a  working  group  for  the \nrevision of the Ulaanbaatar city master plan and ensuring that funding is secured.  \n \nExpenditure.  The  budget  for  MUB  is  prepared  according  to  the  Budget  Law  and  the \n62. \nPublic  Sector  Management  and  Finance  Law.  In  2006,  investment  for  projects  in  Ulaanbaatar \nwas about MNT20 billion, 58% of which came from the Government of Mongolia and 42% from \nthe  local  budget.  While  the  total  revenue  of  MUB  increased  from  MNT38.2  billion  in  2006  to \nMNT65.4  billion  in  2008,  MUB  lacks  financial  resources,  and  it  has  not  been  able  to  invest \nenough in basic urban services or infrastructure development in the ger districts.  \n \n63. \nChallenges  for  Urban  Development.  With  an  accelerating  influx  of  migrants  into \nUlaanbaatar,  the  population  in  ger  areas  increased  by  48%  between  1998  and  2005,  and  the \nresidential land area increased by 24% between 1998 and 2006. In addition to problems noted \nabove regarding the lack of basic services, the rapid and uncontrolled spread of the city raises \nenvironmental concerns. Urban sprawl has been mostly to the east and north, toward sources of \nwater  that  urban  development  could  contaminate  and,  also,  into  flood-prone  areas,  which  has \nproved problematic. The lack of basic infrastructure such as sewerage and heating systems has \ncaused contamination of groundwater and air pollution from burning coal. The situation is further \nexacerbated by the lack of a land management system and mechanism for enforcement. \n \n64.  While Ulaanbaatar faces a number of urban development challenges, Mongolia lacks the \nlegal  system  or  organizational  structure  necessary  for  urban  planning  and  development.  Sub-\nregulations and administrative procedures for executing the Urban Development Law are not in \nplace,  inhibiting  the  actual  implementation  of  development  plans.  There  is  no  mechanism  for \nland-use  control  or  development  permission  linked  to  urban  planning.  Also,  the  administrative \nand  technical  capacity  of  relevant  departments  of  Ulaanbaatar  is  inadequate  to  cope  with  a \nnumber of urban development challenges.  \n \n65.  MRTCUD  and  MUB  have  set  up  working  groups  on  urban  development  law,  land  law, \nand measurement law to address the need to  establish an appropriate legal system for urban \nplanning  and  development  in  Ulaanbaatar.  One  of  the  main  issues  that  the  working  group  on \nurban development law deals with is the redevelopment of ger districts. While MUB prepares for \nupgrading ger districts, there is an urgent need for capacity development in the working group, \nso  that  participatory  planning  and  environmental  and  social  safeguards  are  well  incorporated \ninto  the  actual  planning  and  implementation  process,  thereby  ensuring  improved  living \nconditions in ger districts.    \n\n                                                 \n29 The master plan study commenced in February 2007, and a draft final report was completed in February 2009.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       47 \n\n \n66. \nAccording  to  the  ger  districts  development  strategy  approved  by  the  City  Council  of \nUlaanbaatar, ger districts can be divided into three geographic categories: (i) central ger areas \nwith  relatively  good  access  to  public  services;  (ii)  middle  ger  areas,  where  comprehensive \nimprovement of living conditions is necessary; and (iii) peri-urban ger areas, where urbanization \nneeds  to  be  controlled.  In  the  action  plan,  2009\u20132010,  formulated  by  MRTCUD  and  MUB, \ndetailed planning is scheduled to be conducted for nine middle ger districts. However, the Land \nAdministration Department, which is responsible for drawing up detailed plans, lacks capacity in \nland  management  for  urban  redevelopment.  Thus,  capacity  building  targeting  the  Land \nAdministration Department is a priority need. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f        \n\n \n \n\nPolicy Reform Area \n \nA.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nOn the strength of high international commodity prices, Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown rapidly for the past \nfew  years.  The  country\u2019s  narrowly  based  economy  makes  it  especially  vulnerable  to  commodity  price  fluctuation  and  weather \nshocks. The current global financial crisis has weakened demand for manufactured goods, and this, in turn, has caused copper \nprices to fall by more than 60%. As a result, the budget has come under extraordinary pressure. Nearly 40% of the revenues of \nthe Government of Mongolia (the Government) come from mining. This has had immediate and very negative consequences for \nMongolia\u2019s  fiscal  account,  real  economy,  balance  of  payments,  and  exchange  rate,  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to \nsustain the provision of universal social transfers.a Mongolia\u2019s poverty rate is a high 35.2%, and inequality has grown markedly \nover the past 5 years. Unless the Government is able to bring about an orderly adjustment to this external shock, the resulting \nsocial consequences will be severe, threatening to unwind the gains of recent years. The financial crisis exposes vulnerabilities \nin  Government  revenue  sourcing  and  social  assistance  policies.  It  also  presents  an  opportunity  to  address,  through  selected \npolicy reforms, changes to promote better targeting of the poor and fiscal sustainability in social assistance. \n \nThe Social Sectors Support Program (the Program) will directly contribute to poverty reduction by \nensuring that social sectors expenditures are maintained during the financial crisis; \nproviding  the  foundation  for  reforms  in  social  welfare,  health,  and  education  to  promote  efficiency,  attain  fiscal \nsustainability, and provide assistance to those most in need through targeting methodologies and the creation of an \ninter-sectoral national database of poor households; and \ndeveloping capacity in environmental and social safeguards. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nTo the extent possible, the Program integrates reforms into existing Government programs. Where additional assistance for the \npoor  has  been  identified  as  necessary,  the  Program  has  added  external  funds  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction \n(JFPR). This includes expanding micronutrient distribution programs to address the needs of mothers and children and providing \nto the poor a medicard for free access to health services. In addition, technical assistance (TA) will provide capacity building for \nrelevant stakeholders in poverty targeting, statistical capacity building, national database creation, and safeguards. Importantly, it \nwill  also  help  to  address  political  economy  risks  to  the  reforms  by  ensuring  that  a  consensus-building  and  awareness-raising \nprogram accompanies the reform process.  \n \nThe Program directly supports Government efforts to protect spending on the poor and social sectors during the financial crisis. It \nis  coordinated  with  the  range  of  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  World  Bank,  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, United Nations Development Programme, and others that fall under the umbrella of financial crisis support \nfrom the International Monetary Fund. The Program supports the pillar of inclusive social development in the Country Partnership \nStrategy  and  is  in  line  with  the  emphasis  on  inclusive  economic  growth  in  ADB's  long-term  strategic  framework,  2008-2020 \n(Strategy 2020). It directly reflects ADB's response strategy to the global economic crisis of striving to rebalance economies and \nprovide support to the poor. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \nMongolia  is  among  the  29%  of  all  developing  countries  highly  exposed  to  the  poverty-inducing  effects  of  the  crisis,  in  part \nbecause  of  heavy  Government  reliance  on  volatile  mining  revenues  and  a  high  poverty  rate  of  35.2%  (2007/2008).  What \nprogress has been made in reducing poverty is threatened by the economic crisis. Pressure on spending for essential services \nand social  welfare  will have a strong impact on the poor, who rely on affordable access and social assistance as basic coping \nstrategies, especially in times of economic stress. \n \nThe social impact of the financial crisis must be seen in the context of social and economic change in Mongolia over the past few \nyears. Increased migration, urbanization, and changing livelihoods have created newly vulnerable populations. The crisis comes \ndirectly on the heels of the massive 2008 spikes in inflation, particularly for food items, provoked by the global food crisis. Social \nanalysis  carried  out  to  prepare  the  Food  and  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Program  and  Project  (FNSWPP)  demonstrated  that  the \npoor  were  directly  affected  and  immediately  cut  back  on  the  quality  and  quantity  of  food  they  consumed  and  reduced  or \neliminated  expenditures  for  health,  education,  transport,  and  energy.  Evidence  from  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis  clearly \ndemonstrates that social sectors are affected if not strongly protected, and that the outcome can be long-term deficits in health \nand education particularly detrimental to the youngest.  \n \nThe  Mongolia  Country  Poverty  Assessmentb  highlights  several  important  dynamics  of  poverty  that  will  directly  affect  how  the \nfinancial  crisis  affects  the  poor.  These  include  (i)  rising  inequality  (strong  growth  in  the  economy  has  not  translated  into  faster \npoverty  reduction);  (ii)  worsening  spatial  inequalities  (the  decline  in  the  poverty  rate  in  Ulaanbaatar  is  accompanied  by \n\n \n\n\f62      Appendix 7 \n\nsignificantly worsening poverty in soums and the countryside); (iii) reduced social safety nets and insufficient coping mechanisms \nin  rural  and  urban  areas;  (iv)  the  high  reliance  of  the  poor  on  social  welfare  benefits,  especially  the  child  money  program;  (v) \ndifficulty in paying for school expenses; (vi) inefficiency in the health insurance system for the poor, and (vii) poor infrastructure \nand access to basic services in urban ger areas. \n \nBeneficiaries of the Program include all citizens of Mongolia for some measures and specifically the poor for others. All citizens \nwill  benefit  from  a  social  assistance  system  that  is  fiscally  sustainable.  The  measures  on  health  access  (policy  reform  areas \n[PRA] 3 and 5) and education (PRA 9 and 10) will benefit the entire population, and those on welfare assistance (PRA 2 and 4), \nhealth  access  (PRA  6  and  7),  education  subsidies  (PRA  8),  and  urban  living  conditions  (PRA  11  and  12)  will  particularly  and \ndirectly benefit the poor and improve their living standards and access to basic services. The outlined reforms in social welfare \nwill directly address Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1, targets 1 and 3; in health, MDGs 4 and 5; in education, MDG 2; and \nin urban development, MDG 7, targets 3 and 4. \n \n2. Design Features. Direct poverty reduction measures included in the program design include (i) establishing sectoral targeting \nmethodologies  and  mechanisms,  an  intersectoral  database  of  poor  households,  and  implementation  and  monitoring \narrangements; (ii) raising awareness of reforms and establishing a consensus ensuring them; and (iii) the capacity development \nof stakeholders. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe impact channels for the policy reforms focus on access for the poor and transfers. Direct and short-term impacts will be the \nmaintenance  of  social  expenditures  in  the  Government  budget  and  access  to  benefits  by  the  poor.  Direct  and  medium-term \nimpacts  will  be  increased  efficiency,  better  targeting  of  those  most  in  need,  and  capacity  to  monitor  social  welfare  assistance. \nThe  major  groups  affected  will  be  all  citizens  for  some  measures,  and  particularly  the  poor,  who  will  be  identified  by  a  proxy \nmeans test (PMT) and other targeting methodologies for those measures specifically designed to reach them. \n \nThe  reforms  will  have  direct  impacts  on  household  social  welfare  benefits,  access  to  social  services,  and,  in  the  longer  term, \nurban  services  in  poor  areas.  The  PMT  will  ensure  proper  identification.  Policy  reforms  will  ensure  the  fiscal  sustainability  of \nsocial welfare spending. Several of the reforms will have a particular impact on women (e.g., micronutrients and the medicard) \nand directly improve their access to services and better living conditions. \n \nThe  policy  reforms  address  poverty  reduction,  pro-poor  growth  and  the  MDGs  by  (i)  reforming  the  social  welfare  assistance \nprogram to be financially sustainable and to provide targeted assistance to those most in need (MDG 1); (ii) providing access to \nhealth and nutrition services for all, and in particular the poorest and most vulnerable (MDGs 3 and 4); (iii) providing education to \npoor secondary school students (MDG 2); and (iv) ensuring safe, clean access to basic services in urban areas (MDG 7). \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings  of  Social  Analysis  Findings from the social analysis  were generated from (i) a review of available reports and \nstatistical  data,  (ii)  the  qualitative  participatory  poverty  assessment  and  country  poverty  assessment  (CPA)  carried  out  for  the \ncountry  partnership  strategy  (CPS);  and  (iii)  a  series  of  rapid  consultations  carried  out  in  urban  and  rural  communities.  Focus \ngroup discussions included the poor, elderly, and disabled, and key informant interviews focused on stakeholders in the relevant \nsectors. Key findings include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nThere  has  been  little  poverty  reduction  since  the  last  survey  done  in  2002/2003,  spatial  welfare  differences  have \nbecome more marked, and inequality has worsened, blunting the effects of poverty reduction. \n\n(ii)  High inflation from the food crisis in 2008 had a significant impact on the poor and immediate impacts on consumption \n\nand the access of the poor to services, from which they have not yet recovered. \n\n(iii)  Focus group discussions revealed that the middle class and the poor both feel that it is pushing them into, or further \ninto, poverty. Rising prices for food, falling prices for livestock, limited access to small credit, increasing college tuition \nfees  and  secondary  school  expenses,  downsizing  in  workplaces,  and  worsening  unemployment  are  economic  stress \nfactors affecting households.  \n\n(iv)  Coping  strategies  include  pawning  social  assistance  benefits  to  borrow  on  the  future  payments  to  fulfill  immediate \nneeds for food, clothing, and access to services; greater reliance on welfare payments for household budgets; limiting \naccess to health services and payments for drugs; limiting payments for education; limiting expenses for transport and \nwater, etc. in urban ger areas.  \n\n(v)  There is growing public support for targeting social assistance and a real need to address the deficits of the existing \n\nhealth insurance scheme to provide benefits where they are most needed. \n\n(vi)  Poor urban living conditions and services are extremely costly and a priority for residents. \n\nThe  reforms  under  the  Program  help  ensure  that  spending  in  the  social  sectors  is  maintained.  Some  specific  measures  are \ndirected particularly at the poor, who will be identified through PMT and geographical targeting.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Extensive consultation has been carried out with Government, development partners, and other relevant stakeholders during \nthe  preparation  of  the  Program.  In  addition,  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  is  based  on  a  rapid  assessment  with  focus  group \ndiscussions  and  key  informant  interviews  carried  out  in  rural  soums  and  urban  districts,  the  qualitative  poverty  assessment  of \nFebruary 2009, and the analysis of the 2007\u20132008 National Statistics Office poverty data compiled for the CPA in April 2009. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n \n\n\f Appendix 7       63 \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nNo consultation and participation plan has been prepared for the Program as the policy measures and tranche conditions mostly \ninvolve the creation of working groups and ministerial orders. The two health measures that receive external resources from the \nJFPR (micronutrient distribution and the medicard) have consultation and participation activities built into them. TA will support a \nGovernment advocacy and public awareness program for Parliamentarians, civil society, and the general public. The advocacy \nand  awareness  program  will  focus  on  building  a  consensus  on  social  assistance  targeting  through  a  series  of  workshops  and \noutreach activities that will focus on the (i) benefits of targeting, (ii) need for fiscal sustainability, (iii) mechanics of identification, \nand (iv) grievance mechanisms. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.    Key  Issues.  Extensive  research  on  previous  financial  crises  has  determined  that  they  have  a  disproportionate  impact  on \nwomen.  Lost  jobs  in  the  informal  sector,  increased  household  insecurity,  reduced  women's  consumption,  insufficient  social \nprotection  spending,  declining  access  to  basic  services,  and  increased  work  burdens  have  all  been  identified  as  gender-\ndifferentiated impacts. The Program directly addresses household insecurity, access to services, and social protection spending. \nGendered  dimensions  of  poverty  are  evident  in  Mongolia.  Households  headed  by  single  women  are  a  key  indicator  of  poor \nhouseholds  and  focus  group  discussions  revealed  that  strategies  for  reducing  personal  consumption  and  increasing  work \nburdens are used, particularly by women, when coping with economic stress. Disparities in health outcomes and primary health \ncare  (PHC)  access  affect  men  more  than  women  in  Mongolia.  Women  are  the  primary  users  of  PHC  and  have  better  health \nindicators. The measures will help to ensure basic access for all, and the information, education, and communication component \nwill address gender outreach. Girls outnumber boys in schools in every aimag in Ulaanbaatar, and rural areas have dropout rates \nfor boys much higher than for girls. The sharp increase in the direct costs of education has widened these disparities, as the cost \nof boys' education is now directly charged to families rather than to the state. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

Extensive research on previous financial crises has determined that they have \nhad a disproportionate impact on women. Lost jobs in the informal sector, increased household \ninsecurity,  reduced  women's  consumption,  insufficient  social  protection  spending,  declining \naccess  to  basic  services,  and  increased  work  burdens  have  all  been  identified  as  gender-\ndifferentiated  impacts.  The  Social  Sectors  Support  Program  (the  Program)  directly  addresses \nhousehold  insecurity,  access  to  services,  and  social  protection  spending.  Several  of  the \nmeasures particularly target maintaining maternal and child health. Others will help to address \nlongstanding gender disparities, particularly in health and education.   \n \n2. \nPreparation:  Preparatory  work  to  identify  and  address  gender  issues  in  the  Program \nwas  carried  out  by  desk  review  and  consultations  for  poverty  and  social  assessment  in  urban \nand rural areas. Gender mainstreaming in proxy means test (PMT) development and validation; \ngrievance  procedures;  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  has  been \naddressed under the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project (FNSWPP) gender \naction plan (GAP). A discussion of the gender issues and analysis is included in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n3. \nThe  theme  that  links  the  measures  in  the  Program  is  the  targeting  of  poor  households \nthrough  methodologies  such  as  the  PMT.  This  data-driven  assessment  of  variables  identifies \nhouseholds,  not  individuals.  That  said,  recent  poverty  data  highlights  the  vulnerability  of \nhouseholds  headed  by  single  women,  and,  through  capacity  building  and  the  development  of \nthe  PMT  under  the  FNSWPP  program,  gender  issues  on  vulnerability  will  be  discussed  and \naddressed  as  noted  in  the  GAP  for  that  project.  In  addition,  the  FNSWPP  has  an  extensive \ncapacity  development  component  to  work  on  IEC:  about  social  welfare  benefits,  grievance \nmechanisms,  and  the  PMT  validation  process,  all  of  which  has  been  included  with  gender \nmainstreaming activities in that project\u2019s GAP. \n \n4. \nFor  the  Program,  the  GAP  outlines  the  gender  impacts  of  the  policy  measures  and \nidentifies  specific  actions,  most  of  which  will  be  accomplished  under  the  accompanying \ntechnical  assistance  (TA),  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  Project  for  micronutrients \ndistribution, and the medicard program. It explicitly links to the work being carried out under the \nFNSWPP GAP. The main focus of outputs is the establishment of the national database, which \nwill have sex-disaggregated data. Capacity development for gender analysis is included in the \nTA for the National Statistics Office and the team creating the intersectoral database. Capacity \ndevelopment for addressing gender dimensions in targeting is addressed in the TA support to \nthe Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Ministry of Health. IEC for the consensus \nbuilding  component  of  the  TA  and  the  envisioned  outreach  has  gender  mainstreaming  in  its \nterms of reference. Capacity development in environment and resettlement safeguards includes \nattention to gender issues. Specific gender mainstreaming is included in the terms of reference \nfor  the  TA  consultants.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Mongolia  Resident  Mission \n(MNRM) consultant will provide guidance to working groups and participate in the ADB review \nmissions. \n \nA. \n\nBudget and Implementation Arrangements \n\n5. \nThe action plan does not require a separate budget, as it is integrated into the Program \nand accompanying TA. Implementation responsibility lies with each ministry working group, and \nspecific activities, such as ensuring disaggregated data in the integrated database and providing \ngender-sensitive communication strategies and outreach for the consensus-building component \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8       65 \n\nof  the  TA,  are  included  in  the  terms  of  reference  for  individual  consultants.  Coordinating  and \nmonitoring implementation of the plan will be done by the program support unit in the Ministry of \nFinance, with support from the gender specialist in MNRM. The implementation of the GAP is \nan  assurance  in  loan  documentation.  The  GAP  will  be  implemented  from  mid-2009  to  June \n2011.  \n \nB. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  action  plan  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall \n6. \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  the  Program  and  accompanying  TA.  The  program  support \nunit will be responsible for establishing and coordinating monitoring and evaluation. A midterm \nreview  will  be  accompanied  by  ADB  staff  with  expertise  in  gender  issues.  The  MNRM  gender \nspecialist  will  provide  support  to  the  GAP,  assist  the  ministerial  working  groups  where \nnecessary, and participate on the review missions.  \n\n \n\n\fGender Impact/ Actions \n\nSupporting TA Action \n\nIndicators \n\n66 \n\n Appendix 8 \n\nC. \n\nGender Action Plan Matrix \n\nPolicy \nArea \n\n2  \n\n3 \n\n4  \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8  \n\n11  \n\n12  \n\nPolicy measures will promote sustainable social \nwelfare assistance and target all poor.

The \ndatabase will support sex disaggregation of \nbeneficiary household heads. Grievance \nprocedures and validation measures will address \ngender disparities, and an extensive IEC \ncampaign is planned.  \nThis measure will address the whole population. \nNo adverse gender impacts are expected. \nWomen are the primary users of PHC, and \nimproved access will address some of the \nbarriers to men's use of health care services. \nPharmacies\u2019 increased participation will be \nencouraged to ensure access for all, including \nthose with limited mobility.
