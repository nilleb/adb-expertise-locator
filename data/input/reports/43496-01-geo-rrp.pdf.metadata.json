I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Georgia for the Social Services Delivery Program. The program will help sustain essential \npublic expenditures on social services delivery and social protection in Georgia as the economy \nrecovers from the global financial crisis, while promoting greater effectiveness in delivering \nthese benefits and efficiency in financing them. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Economic recovery is underway in Georgia, but short-term fiscal support is required to \nmaintain  critical  social  expenditures.  Georgia  has  in  2010  continued  to  recover  from  the \neconomic impacts of the August 2008 war and the global financial crisis. However, recovery has \nbeen slower than anticipated. While the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for 2010 \nis projected at 4.5%, an increase from 2.3% in 2008 and \u20133.9% in 2009, revenue shortfalls \ncontinue to exert pressure on public expenditures, particularly on social services spending. \nForeign  direct  investment  has  also  been  slow  to  rebound.  With  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and other \ndevelopment partners, the government is responding to post-conflict economic challenges. At \nthe time of the 2009 emergency loan, the expectation was that recovery would be faster and \nthat further support would not be needed, but it is evident that revenue recovery takes time and, \nthus, further fiscal support is needed to maintain critical social services and protection at a level \nthat preserves the broader safety net for the poor and socially vulnerable. \n \n3.  Government  expenditures  on  social  services  delivery  and  social  protection  have \nconsistently  increased.  The  government  has  a  fairly  comprehensive  program  for  health, \neducation, and social security coverage. It has a set of programs and measures to simplify and \nimprove their targeting and efficiency. They target the 21% of the population categorized as \ngenerally poor1 and the 8.8% categorized as extreme poor.2 Public expenditures on social \nservices and social protection significantly mitigate the incidence of poverty in Georgia. The \nshare  and  levels  of  social  sector  and  social  assistance  expenditures  in  the  budget  have \nincreased substantially since 2004 and are expected to be maintained at adequate levels.3 In \n2004\u20132009, education expenditures increased by six fold, health by 131%, and social protection \nby  262%.  The  largest  increases  were  in  2005\u20132006.  In  addition,  the  basic  pension  rose \nsubstantially from GEL18 per month in 2004 to GEL80 in January 2010.  \n \n4.  Yet, the government wishes to address a range of quality and quantity concerns in the \ndelivery of social services. While the increasing resource allocation for social sector and social \nassistance programs signals the importance the government attaches to delivering adequate \nservices of high quality, a few key challenges remain: (i) access to primary health care services, \n(ii)  training  of  teachers  based  on  professional  standards  adopted  by  the  government,  (iii) \ninvestment  in  health  and  education  infrastructure,  (iv)  increasing  health  care  costs  and \ninsufficient  health  insurance  coverage,  (v)  low  savings  rates  for  income  replacement  in \nretirement,  and  (vi)  unemployment.  The  current  situation  highlights the  need  for  long-term \n                                                 \n1  The generally poor are defined as those consuming 60% or less of the consumption median, and the extreme poor \nas consuming 40% or less. Source: National Statistics Office of Georgia (accessed 1 June 2010). \n2  National Statistics Office of Georgia (accessed 1 June 2010). \n3  Education  expenditures  increased  from  GEL65.3  million  in  2004  to  GEL459.1  million  in  2009,  health  from \nGEL147.3 million to GEL339.8 million, and social protection from GEL364.3 million to GEL1,319.8 million. As a \nshare of total state budget expenditures, education was 3.4% in 2004 and 7.4% in 2010, health was 7.6% in 2004 \nand 6.1% in 2010, and social protection was 18.9% in 2004 and 18.5% in 2010. Low inflation means increases \nhave been substantial in real terms. ", "2 \nstrategic planning, coordinated solutions, and capacity strengthening. ADB\u2019s post-conflict and \ncrisis-related assistance in 2008 and 2009 provided much-needed fiscal support, while not \nburdening the government with a reform agenda as it worked toward a swift recovery. ADB staff \nhave been engaged in background analysis and policy discussions in most areas covered in this \nprogram since late 2008 to ensure that ADB assistance is aligned with a well-defined policy and \ninstitutional framework. The proposed program will supplement ADB\u2019s ongoing and planned \nprojects to promote municipal services and water supply and sanitation for the population at \nlarge, including the vulnerable. \n \n5.  Education outputs and outcomes can be improved. Since 2003, the government has \nundertaken wide-ranging educational reforms that have contributed to a more efficient utilization \nof resources by enhancing schools' financial management capacity, improving the monitoring \nand  reporting  of  academic  attainment,  increasing  the  autonomy  of  schools  through \ndecentralization,  improving  curricula  and  teachers\u2019  salaries,  and  improving  basic  school \ninfrastructure throughout Georgia. School net enrollment rates were, in 2008, 98.7%, with near \ngender  parity.4 At  the  same  time,  learning  outcomes,  benchmarked  through  international \ncomparative achievement tests including the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study5 \nand the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study are below the scale average,6 \nand teacher proficiency varies across schools and regions. \n \n6.  The government aims to increase access to health services and their quality. The health \ncare system in Georgia is in transition from large state-owned hospitals predominantly focused \non providing specialist-based curative care to in-patients to a health care system in which the \nprivate sector is the primary provider of services, with financing coming from a combination of \nstate-financed and private health insurance. The long-term sustainability of the system has \ncome  under  pressure  as  medical  services  are  unable  to  meet  demand  from  a  population \nincreasingly beset by non-communicable diseases7 and with lengthening life expectancy at \nbirth.8 Child, infant, and neonatal mortality rates have fallen in recent years but are still high, \nreflecting shortcomings in the maternal health care system. State health programs9 do not \nprovide the population with full health care coverage, which leads to relatively high out-of-pocket \nexpenses for health care.10 Only citizens below the poverty line are covered by state medical \ninsurance programs, which provide a comprehensive health care package with in-patient and \nambulatory services and 50% reimbursement of essential pharmaceuticals up to a ceiling of \nGEL50 per year. The 16 state programs covered 18% of the population in 2009, or more than \n806,000 people. In addition, the state-subsidized health care insurance, which provides a basic \npackage  for  emergency  health  care  and  full  coverage  of  ambulatory  services  for  124,000  \n                                                 \n4  According to World Bank net enrollment data in 2008. Net enrollment ratio is the ratio of children of official school \nage based on the International Standard Classification of Education 1997 who are enrolled in school to the \npopulation of the corresponding official school age. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR (accessed \n10 May 2010). \n5  Georgia ranked 37th among 45 countries in the distribution of average reading achievement, scoring 471 points, \nwhich  is  below  the  scale  average  of  500  (Progress  in  International  Reading  Literacy  Study.  2006.  2006 \nInternational Report. Massachusetts). \n6  According to TIMSS results for 2007, Georgia ranked 33rd among 48 countries in the distribution of 8th grade \naverage mathematics scores, scoring 410 points, which is below the scale average of 500, and ranked 27th among \n36 countries in the distribution of 4th grade average mathematics scores, scoring 438 points, which is below the \nscale average of 500 (US Department of Education, http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp) (accessed 10 May \n2010). \n7  The number one cause of death is cardiovascular disease (National Statistics Office of Georgia). \n8  For women, from 74.2 years in 1990 to 79.0 years in 2008; and for men from 66.5 years in 1990 to 69.3 years in \n2008 (National Statistics Office of Georgia). \n9  Georgia has 16 state-financed medical service programs. \n10 Out-of-pocket payments cover 70% of health care expenses. ", "3 \nvoluntary enrollees, or 2.8% of the population.11 However, continuing lack of sufficient resources \nand capacity in health service delivery adversely affect public well-being and productivity. \n \n7.  Inadequate public pensions need to be augmented by private pensions. The public \npension system in Georgia provides Georgian male citizens over the age of 65 and female \ncitizens over the age of 60 with an old-age pension and a bonus based on length of service. The \npublic sector also provides a disability pension and payments to surviving family members, as \nwell as a range of specialized but limited pension payments.12 Monthly universal pensions are \nlow at GEL80 per person, which is below the official individual subsistence level of GEL114 per \nmonth13. Monthly utility bills and uninsured medical care can readily exceed this amount. As \nsuch, the elderly depend on other social assistance and intergenerational family support. Private \nsector pension savings plans are limited in coverage, as no more than 16,328 people save this \nway. There were 838,493 pensioners in 2009, or 19% of the population. Population projections \nsuggest a growing number of elderly, exacerbated by a low fertility rate currently at 1.7, which \nraises the elderly dependency ratio. The rising number of possible pensioners and limited \nalternative opportunities to save will have implications for pension costs and place a growing \nburden on the rest of society as it supports the elderly. \n \n8.  The need to achieve gender equality is gaining greater attention. Lower incomes, less \ncapacity for accumulating life savings, and longer life expectancy14 increase the dependence of \nwomen  on  national  social  services  and  protection.  The  number  of  households  headed  by \nwomen is substantial, at 36.4%.15 These households face a greater risk of falling into extreme \npoverty.16 In rural areas, where poverty is more prevalent, women are the most vulnerable.17 \nVulnerability results in gender inequality that explains gender gaps in incomes and access to \nhealth, education, and social protection services. Gender stereotyping is evident in technical, \nprofessional, and postgraduate students\u2019 selection of courses. Women are disinclined to venture \ninto male-dominated fields in science and technology, which yield higher-paid jobs, and remain \nin traditionally female occupations that have lower income potential. \n \n9.  Proposed program. The government has requested ADB support to maintain essential \nexpenditures on social services delivery and social protection as the economy recovers, while \npromoting greater effectiveness in service delivery and efficiency in financing benefits. The \nproposed lending modality is a single-tranche program loan of $100 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources. The proposed loan complements ADB's earlier emergency loan of $70 million \nfor post-conflict recovery in 2008 and $80 million in quick-disbursing financial support to mitigate \nthe adverse impact of the global economic crisis in 2009.18 The program will cover September \n2009\u2013September 2010, include short-term sector reforms, and lay the groundwork for medium-\nterm reforms. The proposed program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which is anchored \n                                                 \n11 The state covered 75% of the cost of this private emergency care health insurance. The remaining 25%, equal to \nGEL5 per capita per month, has to be shouldered by the beneficiary. \n12 Social Service Agency, www.ssa.gov.ge (accessed 1 June 2010). \n13 GEL114 is minimum subsistence level for an individual consumer as of July 2010.

Manila. \n ", "4 \non  inclusive  growth  and  focuses  on  the  core  areas  of  finance  sector  development  and \neducation.19 It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and \nOutcomes under Strategy 2020.  \n \n10.  There is strong continuity in ADB\u2019s assistance. The program builds on post-conflict and \npost-crisis recovery loans disbursed in 2008 and 2009 whose objective was to maintain public \nexpenditures. The program focuses on service delivery reforms to (i) ensure the maintenance of \nsocial  service  and  social  protection  expenditures;  (ii)  support  reform  momentum  in  these \nsectors, which reflects strong government commitment; and (iii) implement Strategy 2020 on \ninclusive growth with a focus on finance sector development and education.20 ADB assessed \nsocial service delivery programs and expenditure requirements as part of 2008\u20132009 budgetary \nsupport. A regional pension assessment that included Georgia was also undertaken.  \n \n11.  The program takes into account the linkage between the loan and macroeconomic \nconditions in Georgia. It (i) provides a revenue cushion by compensating for the slower-than-\nanticipated rise in revenues and thereby helping maintain expenditures, particularly in social \nsectors, and (ii) helps leverage reforms. To ascertain an appropriate size for the program, \nconsideration is given to Georgia's overall financing requirements as well as those for social \nsectors over the period of planned operation, in addition to the importance of these sectors. The \noverall macro picture is one ingredient, but a financing gap also needs to be filled and there are \nfinancing requirements for these sectors. Health, education, and social protection occupy 32% \nof the total state budget for FY2010.  \n \n12.  The program complements support provided by other development partners as verified \nthrough close cooperation and shared information. The World Bank has provided budgetary \nsupport through a series of development policy loans that cover multiple sectors. The European \nUnion supports social assistance but in areas complementary to this program. The IMF has a \nstandby arrangement to ensure macroeconomic, fiscal, and external sector stability. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The long-term impact of the program is sustainable and inclusive social sector financing. \nThe outcome is more effective, efficient, and gender-responsive delivery of social services and \nsocial protection. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The program has four outputs: (i) effective and gender-equitable coverage of social \nservices, (ii) initiatives to support retirement needs, (iii) inclusive allocation of resources for \neducation  and  health  and  establishing  standards,  and  (iv)  sound  management  of  public \nresources for social services delivery and social protection. \n \n1.  Output 1: Effective and Gender-Equitable Coverage of Social Services \n \n15.  More effective coverage of beneficiaries can improve the targeting of social services. \nThe government has undertaken two key measures in the program. First, it has implemented \nthe administration of the medical insurance program for the poor through the Social Service \nAgency. Implementing program administration under a single agency such as the Social Service \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n20 Health, an additional area under the long-term strategic framework, is included because these reforms are vital to \ndevelopment, productivity, social inclusion, and gender equity. Gender equity, a crosscutting theme under Strategy \n2020, is included in program design. ", "5 \nAgency will increase effectiveness in managing information about social service beneficiaries \nand  in  targeting  social  services  delivery  while  also  enabling  more  effective  coverage  of \nbeneficiaries. Second, it has adopted the landmark Law of Georgia on Gender Equality, which \n(i) ensures full and equal access to health care and social assistance without discrimination; (ii) \nprovides  specific  support  for  maternity  care,  family  planning,  and  protecting  women\u2019s \nreproductive rights;21 and (iii) supports equal conditions in general, vocational, and tertiary \neducation.22 \n \n2.  Output 2: Initiatives to Support Retirement Needs \n \na.  Review of Changing National Retirement Needs  \n \n16.  A review of the impact of social needs can promote opportunities for income security \nafter retirement. The Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs (MOLHSA) has initiated\u2014\npartly to follow up on earlier pension assessment done by ADB, its own work\u2014a structured \ndialogue in the government on the long-term impact of changing pension costs for men and \nwomen and of national demographics (i.e., an aging population) and the budgetary implications \narising from these changes.  \n \nb.  Broader Investment Policy for Private Pension Funds Encouraged \n \n17.  A strengthened legal and regulatory framework can support the further development of \nprivate pensions. The enactment of amendments to the Law on Non-State Pension Insurance \nand Provision will enable private pension funds to diversify their investment options and will \npromote information disclosure. Specifically, the amendments contribute to greater disclosure \nas pension documents are to indicate the investment direction of the pension scheme and how \nits financial results will be reflected in pension accumulation (i.e., whether profits or losses \nincurred through fund investments will be taken into account). Hence, private pension funds will \nnot be required to make good any aggregate losses in any accounting period, as was previously \nrequired when investment profit was defined as income from investments less expenses but not \nlosses. Moreover, the amendments support more informed decision making by promoting better \ndisclosure of information by private pension funds. The National Bank of Georgia\u2019s approval of \namendments  to  secondary  legislation  for  the  Law  on  Non-State  Pension  Insurance  and \nProvision will facilitate the implementation of the law. \n \n3.  Output 3: Inclusive Allocation of Resources for Education and Health and \nEstablishing Standards \n \na.  Health Services Designed to Reflect Health Care Needs \n \n18.  Improved service delivery standards and better trained medical staff can improve access \nto health services and their quality to better meet health care needs. Building on work initiated \nafter the conflict, the government has adopted revised minimum service standards for service \nproviders for hospitals, outpatient care, and medical laboratory services participating in the \ngovernment\u2019s medical insurance program. The government has issued a decree on standards \nfor health care facilities that cover (i) service protocols and procedures; (ii) facilities for hygiene, \ndisinfection, and waste material; (iii) the maintenance of adequate medical documentation; and \n(iv) qualification requirements for medical staff. MOLHSA has developed a special program on \nquality  assurance  for  pharmaceuticals  to  ensure  product  adequacy  and  safety.  During \n                                                 \n21 Law of Georgia on Gender Equality, Chapter II, Article 9 and Chapter III, Article 13, para. 2. \n22 Law of Georgia on Gender Equality, Chapter II, Article 4, para. 2.b and Chapter III, Article 7. \n ", "6 \nimplementation of selective control of pharmaceutical products the State Regulation Agency for \nMedical  Activities  can  provide  visual  inspection,  verifying  the  status  of  packaging-marking, \nusability, right to distribution, and observance of requirements by the law.  \n \nb.  Improved Quality of Teachers and Access to Education for Students \nfrom Socially Vulnerable Families \n \n19.  Teacher training and more resources for textbooks and grants can improve the quality of \nteachers and access to education for students from families below the poverty line. The Ministry \nof Education and Science (MOES) has implemented professional standards for teachers by \nlaunching the voluntary certification of teachers, disbursing vouchers to finance training for \napproximately  12,000  teachers  to  help  them  meet  certification  requirements  for  subjects \nincluded in certification exams in 2010. As of mid-August 2010 at least 11,000 teachers have \ntaken the training. The MOES budget for FY2010 allows textbooks to be purchased for at least \n50,000 school children from families below the poverty line. MOES set aside resources in \nFY2010 for tertiary education for students from socially vulnerable families where at least 470 \nsuch students will receive grants to cover the costs of their 4-year undergraduate programs.  \n \n4.  Output  4:  Sound  Management  of  Public  Resources  for  Social  Services \nDelivery and Social Protection \n \na.  Improved Transparency \n \n20.  Effective planning and budget processes enable the efficient management of public \nresources to ensure the delivery of social services and protection. The Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) has expanded the coverage of selected legal entities of public law (LEPLs)23 from 28 to \n111  to  enhance  transparency  and  resource  management  through  a  more  comprehensive \nmonitoring framework and completed a report on budget execution for these LEPLs. In addition, \nMOF has taken the important step of adopting a program to strengthen disclosure in state \nprocurement, which includes special forms to be submitted monthly by the state procurement \nagency. \n \nb.  Internal  Audit  of  General  Management,  Control,  and  Risk \nManagement Efficiency Improved \n \n21.  Improved internal audit can help improve service delivery. The enactment of the Law on \nState Internal Audit and Inspection, supported under the program, will help strengthen internal \naudit and inspection. This is an area where ADB was engaged in policy dialogue in 2008\u20132009 \nbased on work done by the World Bank and the European Union. This law provides for the \nestablishment  of  internal  audit  units  and  financial  management  and  control  functions  in \nministries. To implement the Law on State Internal Audit and Inspection, the National Center of \nState Internal Control was established as an LEPL under MOF, and a pro forma charter for \ninternal  audit  units,  prepared  based  on  international  standards  and  best  practices,  was \ndistributed to at least 10 ministries toward establishing their own internal audit units. MOLHSA \nand MOES will, in line with the Law on State Internal Audit and Inspection, establish internal \naudit units (with functional independence). ADB plans to follow up on the establishment of such \nunits in ministries that execute ADB projects. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n23 LEPLs are public bodies established to implement specific programs or functions. ", "7 \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n22.  The government faces tough socioeconomic challenges and is committed to addressing \nthem with well-designed initiatives. It has laid out its medium-term reform priorities in several \ndocuments. United Georgia Without Poverty24 outlines the government's development program \nfor 2008\u20132012, establishing policy directions regarding economic growth, job creation, focusing \nthe budget on social programs, extending health insurance for the poor, and strengthening \nhigher education. In addition, the government annually prepares the basic data and directions \nstrategy document, the 2009\u20132012 edition of which includes (i) strengthening the social safety \nnet by raising pensions, expanding social assistance coverage, and improving its targeting; (ii) \nexpanding access to medical insurance with state subsidies for the poor; and (iii) improving the \nquality of education by enhancing teacher training and bringing public schools in line with \nmodern standards and equipment. The government allocated in 2010 GEL1,599.2 million to \nMOLHSA, or 23.7% of the overall budget, reflecting a 66% increase in nominal terms over 2007. \nThis includes GEL1,161.3 million for social programs, of which GEL895.9 million is allocated to \nstate pensions and compensations. MOES received an allocation of GEL561.7 million, which \nincluded voucher funding for public schools and other education expenditures.25 \n \n23.  To  effectively  support  these  reform  priorities,  support  socially  vulnerable  and  weak \ngroups, and sustain inclusive economic growth, the government has requested a loan of $100 \nmillion from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom  ADB.  To  ascertain  the  size  of  the  program,  ADB  has  considered  Georgia\u2019s  overall \nfinancing requirements, the financing needed for social sectors over the program period, and \nthe importance of these sectors. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  MOF will be the executing agency for the program. MOES, MOF, MOLHSA, and the \nNational Bank of Georgia will be the implementing agencies. Loan proceeds will be used to pay \nfor items procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the list of \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of \nthe loan will be disbursed following the satisfaction of policy actions and upon effectiveness in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for \nprogram loans. Loan proceeds disbursed against imports will require a certificate from the \ngovernment stipulating that the value of the total imports of Georgia, minus its imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nthat particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify the \naccuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n                                                 \n24 Government of Georgia. 2008.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  According to simulations, public expenditures on social protection significantly mitigate \nthe incidence of poverty in Georgia. Without pension payments, poverty in 2007 would have \nbeen almost 10 percentage points higher; without targeted social assistance, poverty would \nhave been about 2 percentage points higher.26 Total social spending has risen in real terms by \n10% in the post-war period of 2008\u20132010, despite overall budget cuts in response to the crisis. \nThe estimated budget deficit for 2010 is GEL1,241 million. The government faces a financing \ngap that needs to be covered with external borrowing. With the enactment of the Law of Georgia \non  Gender  Equality,  the  program  can  help  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  of \npromoting gender equality, empowering women, and improving maternal health. This law, when \noperationalised, provides for legal mechanisms and conditions for its implementation in the \nrespective areas of public life. \n \nB.  Governance \n26.  Georgia has made good progress in implementing public financial management reforms \nthat address the fiduciary concerns of development partners engaged in budget support. To \naddress the weaknesses raised in the 2008 public expenditure and financial accountability \nreport,27 annual action plans for MOF28 and the National Center of State Internal Control29 were \ndeveloped to more efficiently use and strategically allocate public resources. These action plans \nsupport (i) program budgeting, (ii) budget preparation and approval, (iii) resource management, \n(iv) internal control, and (v) accounting and reporting. The government has conducted regular \nreviews of these systems.30 The Chamber of Control, the national audit institution of Georgia, \nwhich  reports  directly  to  Parliament,  undertakes  annual  audits  of  all  public  expenditure \nprograms.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the Ministry of Finance of Georgia.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n27.  In 2009, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) reported on an analysis of the \nGeorgia Welfare Monitoring Survey, 2009, and the World Bank assessed poverty in Georgia. \nThese  reports  show  that  social  transfers  account  for  an  increasing  share  of  households\u2019 \nmonetary income, making them important lifelines for Georgia's poor. The UNICEF report finds \nthat  pensions  are  an  effective  tool  for  reducing  poverty.31 The  World  Bank\u2019s  assessment \nemphasizes that the double shock of the conflict in 2008 and the financial crisis slowed the \ndecline of poverty in 2008 and 2009. The proposed budget support program is important to \nassure efficient and effective financing of social services delivery and social protection for the \nincreasing number of vulnerable and weak people in Georgia. Tentative conclusions from the \nJune 2010 joint needs assessment progress report find that development partners\u2019 budgetary \n                                                 \n26 United Nations and the World Bank. 2010.

", "9 \nsupport has averted a collapse of domestic demand triggered by reduced consumer and lender \nconfidence and has significantly supported employment. Consolidating the management of a \nrange of social benefits using a single registry and application system\u2014which is applied to \nhealth insurance vouchers, targeted social assistance, benefits for internally displaced persons, \nand electricity vouchers\u2014has proved successful in alleviating poverty. Rapid disbursements into \na budget that is macroeconomically sound and socially responsible provide, with appropriate \nsafeguards, an efficient channel for supporting social and infrastructure spending and providing \na countercyclical stimulus. \n \n28.  The Government of Georgia passed in March 2010 the Law on Gender Equality, which \nunderpins the importance of equal participation for men and women in the development of a \nmarket economy. In line with this law, gender-equality perspectives will be included in state \nprograms for economic development and poverty reduction, as well as in employment policies. \nIn Georgia, gender gaps are evident in labor force participation, the representation of women in \ndecision-making positions in the government, labor laws, remuneration, and the division of \ntraditional household roles. In 2007, 48% of women were employed, compared with 63% of \nmen. Most women reported as employed are self-employed. A significant portion of the female \nworkforce works in agriculture, which is mostly subsistence and not included in the formal \nsector. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  The program is categorized as C regarding impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Georgia faces a number of significant but manageable risks and vulnerabilities.32 The \nrisks include the following: \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic risks. Economic activity has picked up, but weak private capital \ninflows and sluggish credit growth point to a slow recovery in 2010. After the \nsharp drop in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014which, prior to the crisis, was the \nmain engine of growth\u2014inflows returned in the fourth quarter of 2009 but appear \nto be weak in 2010, dropping by 42% in the first quarter compared with the same \nperiod in 2009. The slow rebound of FDI in the first quarter of 2010 has been a \nfactor behind pressures in foreign exchange markets, with the government now \ncounting on FDI resumption in the second half of 2010. The slow easing of credit \nconditions also presents risks. \n(ii)  Public financial management constraints. Notwithstanding significant reforms \nin recent years, public finances can do little to mitigate the impact of the global \nfinancial  crisis.  Capacity  constraints  exist  in  public  finance  management, \nincluding formulating a public expenditure program to mitigate the impact of the \nglobal financial crisis and ensuring that available resources are efficiently utilized \nand strategically allocated toward government priorities. \n \n31.  Should the risks be realized, they would deepen and lengthen the economic downturn \nand require greater external adjustment, including greater adjustment of the exchange rate, \npossible further downsizing of public expenditure plans, and additional external financing. \n \n                                                 \n32 The Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n32.  The risks are mitigated by a number of factors, including recent positive trends that could \ngain  momentum,  sustained  in  part  by  the  improved  external  economic  environment.  Most \npledges of external assistance are on track, and the government and the IMF have intensified \nmacroeconomic  monitoring.  Ongoing  programs supported  by  several  development  partners \nprovide technical assistance to strengthen financial management. The government is committed \nto ambitious deficit reduction. Because of contained expenditures and an expected recovery of \ntax revenues with a rebound in GDP growth and tax measures, the fiscal deficit is expected to \nimprove from 9.2% of 2009 GDP to 6.3% of 2010 GDP. The program will realize immediate \nbenefits  and  create  positive  externalities.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  into  program \ndesign to address risks, provided that the government's commitment to and implementation of \npolicy and fiscal reforms continue in a reasonably stable economic and political environment. \nThe benefits of the program are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The government has assured ADB that the implementation of the program shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n34.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to Georgia for the Social Services Delivery Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n30 August 2010 ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact  Improved coverage of the poor  ADB\u2019s country  Assumptions \nSustainable and  and vulnerable resulting in  performance  Macroeconomic stability \ninclusive social sector  lower poverty incidence from  assessments   \nfinancing  22.1% in 2008a to 19% in    Government gives \n  2013b  National Statistics Office  priority to social services \n  of Georgia  for the socially \nGross national private savings    vulnerable. \nas a percentage of GDP   \nincreases from \u20133.4 in 2008 to  Risks \n1.8 in 2013  FDI does not return to \n  pre-crisis levels. \nBudget expenditures for   \nhealth, education, and social  Inability to finance \nprotection maintained at  measures to improve \naround 32% of total state  social services delivery. \nbudget \nOutcome  Socially vulnerable have  Government budget  Assumptions \nMore effective,  equitable access to education  (MOF)  Good development \nefficient, and gender-      partner coordination \nresponsive delivery of  Population has equitable  National Statistics Office   \nsocial services and  access to improved health  of Georgia  Implementing ministries \nprotection programs   care services  remain committed to \n  social services delivery \nPublic finance management  reforms. \nstrengthened with   \nestablishment of internal audit  Risk \nunits in relevant ministries  Institutional capacity to \ndevelop and implement \nreforms affected by the \neconomic crises \nOutputs  Increased percentage of  ADB\u2019s country  Assumption \n1.
