The  program  will  help  sustain  essential \npublic expenditures on social services delivery and social protection in Georgia as the economy \nrecovers  from  the  global  financial  crisis,  while  promoting  greater  effectiveness  in  delivering \nthese benefits and efficiency in financing them. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nEconomic  recovery  is  underway  in  Georgia,  but  short-term  fiscal  support  is  required  to \n2. \nmaintain  critical  social  expenditures.  Georgia  has  in  2010  continued  to  recover  from  the \neconomic impacts of the August 2008 war and the global financial crisis. However, recovery has \nbeen slower than anticipated. While the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for 2010 \nis  projected  at  4.5%,  an  increase  from  2.3%  in  2008  and  \u20133.9%  in  2009,  revenue  shortfalls \ncontinue  to  exert  pressure  on  public  expenditures,  particularly  on  social  services  spending. \nForeign  direct  investment  has  also  been  slow  to  rebound.  With  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  World  Bank,  and  other \ndevelopment  partners,  the  government  is  responding  to  post-conflict  economic  challenges.  At \nthe  time  of  the  2009  emergency  loan,  the  expectation  was  that  recovery  would  be  faster  and \nthat further support would not be needed, but it is evident that revenue recovery takes time and, \nthus, further fiscal support is needed to maintain critical social services and protection at a level \nthat preserves the broader safety net for the poor and socially vulnerable. \n \n3. \nGovernment  expenditures  on  social  services  delivery  and  social  protection  have \nconsistently  increased.  The  government  has  a  fairly  comprehensive  program  for  health, \neducation, and social security coverage. It has a set of programs and measures to simplify and \nimprove  their  targeting  and  efficiency.  They  target  the  21%  of  the  population  categorized  as \ngenerally  poor 1 and  the  8.8%  categorized  as  extreme  poor. 2 Public  expenditures  on  social \nservices  and  social  protection  significantly  mitigate  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  Georgia.  The \nshare  and  levels  of  social  sector  and  social  assistance  expenditures  in  the  budget  have \nincreased  substantially  since  2004  and  are  expected  to  be  maintained  at  adequate  levels.3 In \n2004\u20132009, education expenditures increased by six fold, health by 131%, and social protection \nby  262%.  The  largest  increases  were  in  2005\u20132006.  In  addition,  the  basic  pension  rose \nsubstantially from GEL18 per month in 2004 to GEL80 in January 2010.  \n \n4. \nYet, the government wishes to address a range of quality and quantity concerns in the \ndelivery of social services. While the increasing resource allocation for social sector and social \nassistance  programs  signals  the  importance  the  government  attaches  to  delivering  adequate \nservices of high quality, a few key challenges remain: (i) access to primary health care services, \n(ii)  training  of  teachers  based  on  professional  standards  adopted  by  the  government,  (iii) \ninvestment  in  health  and  education  infrastructure,  (iv)  increasing  health  care  costs  and \ninsufficient  health  insurance  coverage,  (v)  low  savings  rates  for  income  replacement  in \nretirement,  and  (vi)  unemployment.  The  current  situation  highlights  the  need  for  long-term \n                                                 \n1  The generally poor are defined as those consuming 60% or less of the consumption median, and the extreme poor \n\nas consuming 40% or less. Source: National Statistics Office of Georgia (accessed 1 June 2010). \n\n2  National Statistics Office of Georgia (accessed 1 June 2010). \n3  Education  expenditures  increased  from  GEL65.3  million  in  2004  to  GEL459.1  million  in  2009,  health  from \nGEL147.3  million  to  GEL339.8  million,  and  social  protection  from  GEL364.3  million  to  GEL1,319.8  million.  As  a \nshare of total state budget expenditures, education was 3.4% in 2004 and 7.4% in 2010, health was 7.6% in 2004 \nand  6.1%  in  2010,  and  social  protection  was  18.9%  in  2004  and  18.5%  in  2010.  Low  inflation  means  increases \nhave been substantial in real terms. \n\n\f2 \n\nincreasing \n\nthe  autonomy  of  schools \n\nstrategic  planning,  coordinated  solutions,  and  capacity  strengthening.  ADB\u2019s  post-conflict  and \ncrisis-related  assistance  in  2008  and  2009  provided  much-needed  fiscal  support,  while  not \nburdening the government with a reform agenda as it worked toward a swift recovery. ADB staff \nhave been engaged in background analysis and policy discussions in most areas covered in this \nprogram since late 2008 to ensure that ADB assistance is aligned with a well-defined policy and \ninstitutional  framework.  The  proposed  program  will  supplement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  and  planned \nprojects  to  promote  municipal  services  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  for  the  population  at \nlarge, including the vulnerable. \n \n5. \nEducation  outputs  and  outcomes  can  be  improved.  Since  2003,  the  government  has \nundertaken wide-ranging educational reforms that have contributed to a more efficient utilization \nof  resources  by  enhancing  schools'  financial  management  capacity,  improving  the  monitoring \nthrough \nand  reporting  of  academic  attainment, \ndecentralization,  improving  curricula  and  teachers\u2019  salaries,  and  improving  basic  school \ninfrastructure throughout Georgia. School net enrollment rates were, in 2008, 98.7%, with near \ngender  parity. 4  At  the  same  time,  learning  outcomes,  benchmarked  through  international \ncomparative achievement tests including the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study5 \nand the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study are below the scale average,6 \nand teacher proficiency varies across schools and regions. \n \nThe government aims to increase access to health services and their quality. The health \n6. \ncare system in Georgia is in transition from large state-owned hospitals predominantly focused \non  providing  specialist-based  curative  care  to  in-patients  to a  health  care  system  in  which  the \nprivate sector is the primary provider of services, with financing coming from a combination of \nstate-financed  and  private  health  insurance.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the  system  has \ncome  under  pressure  as  medical  services  are  unable  to  meet  demand  from  a  population \nincreasingly  beset  by  non-communicable  diseases 7 and  with  lengthening  life  expectancy  at \nbirth.8 Child,  infant,  and  neonatal  mortality  rates  have  fallen  in  recent  years  but  are  still  high, \nreflecting  shortcomings  in  the  maternal  health  care  system.  State  health  programs 9 do  not \nprovide the population with full health care coverage, which leads to relatively high out-of-pocket \nexpenses  for  health  care.10 Only  citizens  below  the  poverty  line  are  covered  by  state  medical \ninsurance  programs,  which  provide  a  comprehensive  health  care  package  with  in-patient  and \nambulatory  services  and  50%  reimbursement  of  essential  pharmaceuticals  up  to  a  ceiling  of \nGEL50 per year. The 16 state programs covered 18% of the population in 2009, or more than \n806,000 people. In addition, the state-subsidized health care insurance, which provides a basic \npackage  for  emergency  health  care  and  full  coverage  of  ambulatory  services  for  124,000  \n\n                                                 \n4  According to World Bank net enrollment data in 2008. Net enrollment ratio is the ratio of children of official school \nage  based  on  the  International  Standard  Classification  of  Education  1997  who  are  enrolled  in  school  to  the \npopulation  of  the  corresponding  official  school  age.  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR  (accessed \n10 May 2010). \n\n5  Georgia  ranked  37th  among  45  countries  in  the  distribution  of  average  reading  achievement,  scoring  471  points, \nwhich  is  below  the  scale  average  of  500  (Progress  in  International  Reading  Literacy  Study.  2006.  2006 \nInternational Report. Massachusetts). \n\n6  According  to  TIMSS  results  for  2007,  Georgia  ranked  33rd  among  48  countries  in  the  distribution  of  8th  grade \naverage mathematics scores, scoring 410 points, which is below the scale average of 500, and ranked 27th among \n36  countries  in  the  distribution  of  4th  grade  average  mathematics  scores,  scoring  438  points,  which  is  below  the \nscale  average  of  500  (US  Department  of  Education,  http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp)  (accessed  10  May \n2010). \n\n7  The number one cause of death is cardiovascular disease (National Statistics Office of Georgia). \n8  For women, from 74.2 years in 1990 to 79.0 years in 2008; and for men from 66.5 years in 1990 to 69.3 years in \n\n2008 (National Statistics Office of Georgia). \n\n9  Georgia has 16 state-financed medical service programs. \n10 Out-of-pocket payments cover 70% of health care expenses. \n\n\f3 \n\nvoluntary enrollees, or 2.8% of the population.11 However, continuing lack of sufficient resources \nand capacity in health service delivery adversely affect public well-being and productivity. \n \n7. \nInadequate  public  pensions  need  to  be  augmented  by  private  pensions.  The  public \npension  system  in  Georgia  provides  Georgian  male  citizens  over  the  age  of  65  and  female \ncitizens over the age of 60 with an old-age pension and a bonus based on length of service. The \npublic sector also provides a disability pension and payments to surviving family members, as \nwell as a range of specialized but limited pension payments.12 Monthly universal pensions are \nlow at GEL80 per person, which is below the official individual subsistence level of GEL114 per \nmonth13.  Monthly  utility  bills  and  uninsured  medical  care  can  readily  exceed  this  amount.  As \nsuch, the elderly depend on other social assistance and intergenerational family support. Private \nsector pension savings plans are limited in coverage, as no more than 16,328 people save this \nway. There were 838,493 pensioners in 2009, or 19% of the population. Population projections \nsuggest a growing number of elderly, exacerbated by a low fertility rate currently at 1.7, which \nraises  the  elderly  dependency  ratio.  The  rising  number  of  possible  pensioners  and  limited \nalternative  opportunities  to  save  will  have  implications  for  pension  costs  and  place  a  growing \nburden on the rest of society as it supports the elderly. \n \n8. \nThe  need  to  achieve  gender  equality  is  gaining  greater  attention.  Lower  incomes,  less \ncapacity for accumulating life savings, and longer life expectancy14 increase the dependence of \nwomen  on  national  social  services  and  protection.  The  number  of  households  headed  by \nwomen is substantial, at 36.4%.15 These households face a greater risk of falling into extreme \npoverty.16 In  rural  areas,  where  poverty  is  more  prevalent,  women  are  the  most  vulnerable.17 \nVulnerability  results  in  gender  inequality  that  explains  gender  gaps  in  incomes  and  access  to \nhealth,  education,  and  social  protection  services.  Gender  stereotyping  is  evident  in  technical, \nprofessional, and postgraduate students\u2019 selection of courses. Women are disinclined to venture \ninto male-dominated fields in science and technology, which yield higher-paid jobs, and remain \nin traditionally female occupations that have lower income potential. \n \n9. \nProposed program. The government has requested ADB support to maintain essential \nexpenditures on social services delivery and social protection as the economy recovers, while \npromoting  greater  effectiveness  in  service  delivery  and  efficiency  in  financing  benefits.  The \nproposed lending modality is a single-tranche program loan of $100 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources. The proposed loan complements ADB's earlier emergency loan of $70 million \nfor post-conflict recovery in 2008 and $80 million in quick-disbursing financial support to mitigate \nthe adverse impact of the global economic crisis in 2009.18 The program will cover September \n2009\u2013September 2010, include short-term sector reforms, and lay the groundwork for medium-\nterm reforms. The proposed program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which is anchored \n                                                 \n11 The state covered 75% of the cost of this private emergency care health insurance. The remaining 25%, equal to \n\nGEL5 per capita per month, has to be shouldered by the beneficiary. \n\n12 Social Service Agency, www.ssa.gov.ge (accessed 1 June 2010). \n13 GEL114  is  minimum  subsistence  level  for  an  individual  consumer  as  of  July  2010.

The program builds on post-conflict and \n10. \npost-crisis recovery loans disbursed in 2008 and 2009 whose objective was to maintain public \nexpenditures. The program focuses on service delivery reforms to (i) ensure the maintenance of \nsocial  service  and  social  protection  expenditures;  (ii)  support  reform  momentum  in  these \nsectors,  which  reflects  strong  government  commitment;  and  (iii)  implement  Strategy  2020  on \ninclusive  growth  with  a  focus  on  finance  sector  development  and  education.20 ADB  assessed \nsocial service delivery programs and expenditure requirements as part of 2008\u20132009 budgetary \nsupport. A regional pension assessment that included Georgia was also undertaken.  \n \n11. \nThe  program  takes  into  account  the  linkage  between  the  loan  and  macroeconomic \nconditions  in  Georgia.  It  (i)  provides  a  revenue  cushion  by  compensating  for  the  slower-than-\nanticipated  rise  in  revenues  and  thereby  helping  maintain  expenditures,  particularly  in  social \nsectors,  and  (ii)  helps  leverage  reforms.  To  ascertain  an  appropriate  size  for  the  program, \nconsideration  is  given  to  Georgia's  overall  financing  requirements  as  well  as  those  for  social \nsectors over the period of planned operation, in addition to the importance of these sectors. The \noverall macro picture is one ingredient, but a financing gap also needs to be filled and there are \nfinancing requirements for these sectors. Health, education, and social protection occupy 32% \nof the total state budget for FY2010.  \n \n12. \nThe program complements support provided by other development partners as verified \nthrough  close  cooperation  and  shared  information.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  budgetary \nsupport through a series of development policy loans that cover multiple sectors. The European \nUnion  supports  social  assistance  but  in areas complementary  to  this  program.  The  IMF  has a \nstandby arrangement to ensure macroeconomic, fiscal, and external sector stability. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe long-term impact of the program is sustainable and inclusive social sector financing. \nThe outcome is more effective, efficient, and gender-responsive delivery of social services and \nsocial protection. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe  program  has  four  outputs:  (i)  effective  and  gender-equitable  coverage  of  social \nservices,  (ii)  initiatives  to  support  retirement  needs,  (iii)  inclusive  allocation  of  resources  for \neducation  and  health  and  establishing  standards,  and  (iv)  sound  management  of  public \nresources for social services delivery and social protection. \n\n \n1. \n\nOutput 1: Effective and Gender-Equitable Coverage of Social Services \n \n\n15.  More  effective  coverage  of  beneficiaries  can  improve  the  targeting  of  social  services. \nThe  government  has  undertaken  two  key  measures  in  the  program.  First,  it  has  implemented \nthe  administration  of  the  medical  insurance  program  for  the  poor  through  the  Social  Service \nAgency. Implementing program administration under a single agency such as the Social Service \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n20 Health, an additional area under the long-term strategic framework, is included because these reforms are vital to \ndevelopment, productivity, social inclusion, and gender equity. Gender equity, a crosscutting theme under Strategy \n2020, is included in program design. \n\n\f5 \n\nAgency  will  increase  effectiveness  in  managing  information  about  social  service  beneficiaries \nand  in  targeting  social  services  delivery  while  also  enabling  more  effective  coverage  of \nbeneficiaries. Second, it has adopted the landmark Law of Georgia on Gender Equality, which \n(i) ensures full and equal access to health care and social assistance without discrimination; (ii) \nprovides  specific  support  for  maternity  care,  family  planning,  and  protecting  women\u2019s \nreproductive  rights; 21  and  (iii)  supports  equal  conditions  in  general,  vocational,  and  tertiary \neducation.22 \n\nOutput 2: Initiatives to Support Retirement Needs \n\n \n\n2. \n \n\na. \n\nReview of Changing National Retirement Needs  \n\n \nA  review  of  the  impact  of  social  needs  can  promote  opportunities  for  income  security \n16. \nafter  retirement.  The  Ministry  of  Labor,  Health,  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLHSA)  has  initiated\u2014\npartly  to  follow  up  on  earlier  pension  assessment  done  by  ADB,  its  own  work\u2014a  structured \ndialogue  in  the  government  on  the  long-term  impact  of  changing  pension  costs  for  men  and \nwomen and of national demographics (i.e., an aging population) and the budgetary implications \narising from these changes.  \n \n\nb. \n\nBroader Investment Policy for Private Pension Funds Encouraged \n\n \n17. \nA strengthened legal and regulatory framework can support the further development of \nprivate  pensions.  The  enactment  of  amendments  to  the  Law  on  Non-State  Pension  Insurance \nand  Provision  will  enable  private  pension  funds  to  diversify  their  investment  options  and  will \npromote  information  disclosure.  Specifically,  the  amendments  contribute  to  greater  disclosure \nas pension documents are to indicate the investment direction of the pension scheme and how \nits  financial  results  will  be  reflected  in  pension  accumulation  (i.e.,  whether  profits  or  losses \nincurred through fund investments will be taken into account). Hence, private pension funds will \nnot be required to make good any aggregate losses in any accounting period, as was previously \nrequired when investment profit was defined as income from investments less expenses but not \nlosses. Moreover, the amendments support more informed decision making by promoting better \ndisclosure of information by private pension funds. The National Bank of Georgia\u2019s approval of \namendments  to  secondary  legislation  for  the  Law  on  Non-State  Pension  Insurance  and \nProvision will facilitate the implementation of the law. \n \n\nOutput  3:  Inclusive  Allocation  of  Resources  for  Education  and  Health  and \nEstablishing Standards \n\nHealth Services Designed to Reflect Health Care Needs \n\n18. \nImproved service delivery standards and better trained medical staff can improve access \nto health services and their quality to better meet health care needs. Building on work initiated \nafter  the  conflict,  the  government  has  adopted  revised  minimum  service  standards  for  service \nproviders  for  hospitals,  outpatient  care,  and  medical  laboratory  services  participating  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s medical insurance program. The  government has issued a decree on standards \nfor health care facilities that cover (i) service protocols and procedures; (ii) facilities for hygiene, \ndisinfection, and waste material; (iii) the maintenance of adequate medical documentation; and \n(iv) qualification requirements for medical staff.

The Ministry \nof  Education  and  Science  (MOES)  has  implemented  professional  standards  for  teachers  by \nlaunching  the  voluntary  certification  of  teachers,  disbursing  vouchers  to  finance  training  for \napproximately  12,000  teachers  to  help  them  meet  certification  requirements  for  subjects \nincluded  in  certification  exams  in  2010.  As  of  mid-August  2010  at  least  11,000  teachers  have \ntaken the training. The MOES budget for FY2010 allows textbooks to be purchased for at least \n50,000  school  children  from  families  below  the  poverty  line.  MOES  set  aside  resources  in \nFY2010 for  tertiary education for students from socially vulnerable families where at least 470 \nsuch students will receive grants to cover the costs of their 4-year undergraduate programs.  \n \n\nOutput  4:  Sound  Management  of  Public  Resources  for  Social  Services \nDelivery and Social Protection \n\n4. \n\n \n\na. \n\nImproved Transparency \n\n \n20. \nEffective  planning  and  budget  processes  enable  the  efficient  management  of  public \nresources  to  ensure  the  delivery  of  social  services  and  protection.  The  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF) has expanded the coverage of selected legal entities of public law (LEPLs)23 from 28 to \n111  to  enhance  transparency  and  resource  management  through  a  more  comprehensive \nmonitoring framework and completed a report on budget execution for these LEPLs. In addition, \nMOF  has  taken  the  important  step  of  adopting  a  program  to  strengthen  disclosure  in  state \nprocurement,  which  includes  special  forms  to  be  submitted  monthly  by  the  state  procurement \nagency. \n \n\nb. \n\nInternal  Audit  of  General  Management,  Control,  and  Risk \nManagement Efficiency Improved \n\n \n21. \nImproved internal audit can help improve service delivery. The enactment of the Law on \nState Internal Audit and Inspection, supported under the program, will help strengthen internal \naudit and inspection. This is an area where ADB was engaged in policy dialogue in 2008\u20132009 \nbased  on  work  done  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Union.  This  law  provides  for  the \nestablishment  of  internal  audit  units  and  financial  management  and  control  functions  in \nministries. To implement the Law on State Internal Audit and Inspection, the National Center of \nState  Internal  Control  was  established  as  an  LEPL  under  MOF,  and  a  pro  forma  charter  for \ninternal  audit  units,  prepared  based  on  international  standards  and  best  practices,  was \ndistributed to at least 10 ministries toward establishing their own internal audit units. MOLHSA \nand  MOES  will,  in  line  with  the  Law  on  State  Internal  Audit  and  Inspection,  establish  internal \naudit units (with functional independence). ADB plans to follow up on the establishment of such \nunits in ministries that execute ADB projects. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n23 LEPLs are public bodies established to implement specific programs or functions. \n\n\f7 \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\nD. \n \n22. \nThe government faces tough socioeconomic challenges and is committed to addressing \nthem  with  well-designed  initiatives.  It  has  laid  out  its  medium-term  reform  priorities  in  several \ndocuments. United Georgia Without Poverty24 outlines the government's development program \nfor 2008\u20132012, establishing policy directions regarding economic growth, job creation, focusing \nthe  budget  on  social  programs,  extending  health  insurance  for  the  poor,  and  strengthening \nhigher  education.  In  addition,  the  government  annually  prepares  the  basic  data  and  directions \nstrategy document, the 2009\u20132012 edition of which includes (i) strengthening the social safety \nnet by raising pensions, expanding social assistance coverage, and improving its targeting; (ii) \nexpanding access to medical insurance with state subsidies for the poor; and (iii) improving the \nquality  of  education  by  enhancing  teacher  training  and  bringing  public  schools  in  line  with \nmodern  standards  and  equipment.  The  government  allocated  in  2010  GEL1,599.2  million  to \nMOLHSA, or 23.7% of the overall budget, reflecting a 66% increase in nominal terms over 2007. \nThis includes GEL1,161.3 million for social programs, of which GEL895.9 million is allocated to \nstate  pensions  and  compensations.  MOES  received  an  allocation  of  GEL561.7  million,  which \nincluded voucher funding for public schools and other education expenditures.25 \n \n23. \nTo  effectively  support  these  reform  priorities,  support  socially  vulnerable  and  weak \ngroups, and sustain inclusive economic growth, the government has requested a loan of $100 \nmillion from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to \nborrow  under  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom  ADB.  To  ascertain  the  size  of  the  program,  ADB  has  considered  Georgia\u2019s  overall \nfinancing  requirements,  the  financing  needed  for  social  sectors  over  the  program  period,  and \nthe importance of these sectors. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n24.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  program.  MOES,  MOF,  MOLHSA,  and  the \nNational Bank of Georgia will be the implementing agencies. Loan proceeds will be used to pay \nfor  items  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  list  of \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of \nthe loan will be disbursed following the satisfaction of policy actions and upon effectiveness in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for \nprogram  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the \ngovernment  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of  Georgia,  minus  its  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nthat  particular  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Government of Georgia. 2008.

Without  pension  payments,  poverty  in  2007  would  have \nbeen  almost  10  percentage  points  higher;  without  targeted  social  assistance,  poverty  would \nhave been about 2 percentage points higher.26 Total social spending has risen in real terms by \n10% in the post-war period of 2008\u20132010, despite overall budget cuts in response to the crisis. \nThe  estimated  budget  deficit  for  2010  is  GEL1,241  million.  The  government  faces  a  financing \ngap that needs to be covered with external borrowing. With the enactment of the Law of Georgia \non  Gender  Equality,  the  program  can  help  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  of \npromoting gender equality, empowering women, and improving maternal health. This law, when \noperationalised,  provides  for  legal  mechanisms  and  conditions  for  its  implementation  in  the \nrespective areas of public life. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nGeorgia has made good progress in implementing public financial management reforms \nthat  address  the  fiduciary  concerns  of  development  partners  engaged  in  budget  support.  To \naddress  the  weaknesses  raised  in  the  2008  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nreport,27 annual action plans for MOF28 and the National Center of State Internal Control29 were \ndeveloped to more efficiently use and strategically allocate public resources. These action plans \nsupport (i) program budgeting, (ii) budget preparation and approval, (iii) resource management, \n(iv)  internal  control,  and  (v)  accounting  and  reporting.  The  government  has  conducted  regular \nreviews  of  these  systems.30 The  Chamber  of  Control,  the  national  audit  institution  of  Georgia, \nwhich  reports  directly  to  Parliament,  undertakes  annual  audits  of  all  public  expenditure \nprograms.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the Ministry of Finance of Georgia.  \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\nIn  2009,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  reported  on  an  analysis  of  the \n27. \nGeorgia  Welfare  Monitoring  Survey,  2009,  and  the  World  Bank  assessed  poverty  in  Georgia. \nThese  reports  show  that  social  transfers  account  for  an  increasing  share  of  households\u2019 \nmonetary income, making them important lifelines for Georgia's poor. The UNICEF report finds \nthat  pensions  are  an  effective  tool  for  reducing  poverty. 31  The  World  Bank\u2019s  assessment \nemphasizes  that  the  double  shock  of  the  conflict  in  2008  and  the  financial  crisis  slowed  the \ndecline  of  poverty  in  2008  and  2009.  The  proposed  budget  support  program  is  important  to \nassure  efficient  and  effective  financing  of  social  services  delivery  and  social  protection  for  the \nincreasing  number  of  vulnerable  and  weak  people  in  Georgia.

Rapid disbursements into \na  budget  that  is  macroeconomically  sound  and  socially  responsible  provide,  with  appropriate \nsafeguards, an efficient channel for supporting social and infrastructure spending and providing \na countercyclical stimulus. \n \n28. \nThe Government of Georgia passed in March 2010 the Law on Gender Equality, which \nunderpins  the  importance  of  equal  participation  for  men  and  women  in  the  development  of  a \nmarket  economy.  In  line  with  this  law,  gender-equality  perspectives  will  be  included  in  state \nprograms for economic development and poverty reduction, as well as in employment policies. \nIn Georgia, gender gaps are evident in labor force participation, the representation of women in \ndecision-making  positions  in  the  government,  labor  laws,  remuneration,  and  the  division  of \ntraditional  household  roles.  In  2007,  48%  of  women  were  employed,  compared  with  63%  of \nmen. Most women reported as employed are self-employed. A significant portion of the female \nworkforce  works  in  agriculture,  which  is  mostly  subsistence  and  not  included  in  the  formal \nsector. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  program  is  categorized  as  C  regarding  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \n\n29. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nrisks include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nGeorgia  faces  a  number  of  significant  but  manageable  risks  and  vulnerabilities.32 The \n\nMacroeconomic risks. Economic activity has picked up, but weak private capital \ninflows  and  sluggish  credit  growth  point  to  a  slow  recovery  in  2010.  After  the \nsharp drop in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014which, prior to the crisis, was the \nmain engine of growth\u2014inflows returned in the fourth quarter of 2009 but appear \nto be weak in 2010, dropping by 42% in the first quarter compared with the same \nperiod in 2009. The slow rebound of FDI in the first quarter of 2010 has been a \nfactor  behind  pressures  in  foreign  exchange  markets,  with  the  government  now \ncounting on FDI resumption in the second half of 2010. The slow easing of credit \nconditions also presents risks. \nPublic financial management constraints. Notwithstanding significant reforms \nin  recent  years,  public  finances can  do  little  to mitigate  the  impact  of  the  global \nfinancial  crisis.  Capacity  constraints  exist  in  public  finance  management, \nincluding formulating a public expenditure program to mitigate the impact of the \nglobal financial crisis and ensuring that available resources are efficiently utilized \nand strategically allocated toward government priorities. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n31. \nShould  the  risks  be  realized,  they  would  deepen  and  lengthen  the  economic  downturn \nand  require  greater  external  adjustment,  including  greater  adjustment  of  the  exchange  rate, \npossible further downsizing of public expenditure plans, and additional external financing. \n \n\n                                                 \n32 The Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n \n\n\f10 \n\nThe risks are mitigated by a number of factors, including recent positive trends that could \n32. \ngain  momentum,  sustained  in  part  by  the  improved  external  economic  environment.  Most \npledges of external assistance are on track, and the government and the IMF have intensified \nmacroeconomic  monitoring.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by  several  development  partners \nprovide technical assistance to strengthen financial management. The government is committed \nto ambitious deficit reduction. Because of contained expenditures and an expected recovery of \ntax revenues with a rebound in GDP growth and tax measures, the fiscal deficit is expected to \nimprove  from  9.2%  of  2009  GDP  to  6.3%  of  2010  GDP.  The  program  will  realize  immediate \nbenefits  and  create  positive  externalities.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  into  program \ndesign to address risks, provided that the government's commitment to and implementation of \npolicy  and  fiscal  reforms  continue  in  a  reasonably  stable  economic  and  political  environment. \nThe benefits of the program are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that the implementation of the program shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n34. \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to Georgia for the Social Services Delivery Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n30 August 2010 \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\nAssumptions \nMacroeconomic stability \n \nGovernment gives \npriority to social services \nfor the socially \nvulnerable. \n \nRisks \nFDI does not return to \npre-crisis levels. \n \nInability to finance \nmeasures to improve \nsocial services delivery. \n\nAssumptions \nGood development \npartner coordination \n \nImplementing ministries \nremain committed to \nsocial services delivery \nreforms. \n \nRisk \nInstitutional capacity to \ndevelop and implement \nreforms affected by the \neconomic crises \nAssumption \nReforms completed in a \ntimely manner and the \nrecommendations \nsupported by \nparticipating ministries \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \nADB\u2019s country \nperformance \nassessments \n \nNational Statistics Office \nof Georgia \n \n\nGovernment budget \n(MOF) \n \nNational Statistics Office \nof Georgia \n\nADB\u2019s country \nperformance \nassessment \n \nNational Statistics Office \nof Georgia \n \nCopy of signed Law on \nGender Equality \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nSustainable and \ninclusive social sector \nfinancing \n \n\nOutcome \nMore effective, \nefficient, and gender- \nresponsive delivery of \nsocial services and \nprotection programs  \n\nOutputs \n1.
