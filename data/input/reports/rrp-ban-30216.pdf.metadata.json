PEDP  II  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  stakeholders \nthrough  a  Government-led  participatory  process.  Results  from  an  in-\ndepth evaluation of the First Primary Education Development Program  \n(PEDP  I)  were  incorporated  as  well  as  lessons  learned  from  other \nsectorwide  approach  programs  (SWAPs)  in  Bangladesh  and  in  the \nregion. PEDP II is an integrated and coordinated program covering the \nformal  primary  education  subsector.  PEDP  II  will  focus  on  improving \nthe quality of education in primary schools; it will strengthen policy, and \norganizational  and  institutional  development  necessary  to  support \ncoordination,  subsector  planning,  management,  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  PEDP  II  includes  a  comprehensive  policy  and  institutional \nreform framework, a common set of key performance indicators, and a \ncommon  implementation  framework  for  support  from  the  Government \nand  its  development  partners.  PEDP  II  has  been  designed  to  be  a \ncatalyst  in  achieving  holistic,  sectorwide  planning  in  the  education \nsector  in  the  long  term.  PEDP  II  will  support  the  Government\u2019s \nEducation \nthe  Millennium \nfor  All  (EFA)  plans,  achievement  of \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and the poverty reduction agenda.  \n \nBangladesh  has  one  of  the  largest  primary  education  systems  in  the \nworld.  In  the  year  2001,  17.7  million  students  were  enrolled  in  over \n78,000 primary-level institutions and were taught by more than 320,000 \nteachers.  This  represented  a  30.8%  increase  in  formal  primary \neducation  enrollments  from  the  level  in  1991.  In  2001,  the  gross \nenrollment  ratio  was  97.5%  and  girls\u2019  enrollment  was  slightly  higher \nthan boys\u2019. The overall net enrollment ratio was about 81%. \n\nWhile  access  to  primary  education  has  been  provided,  its  quality  has \nstagnated.  There  are  several  reasons  for  the  poor  performance.  The \noverall  pupil-teacher  ratio  is  about  55:1,  but  is  67:1  in  Government \nprimary schools (GPS). With the double shift system operating in 90% \nof primary schools, the pupils-in-class-to-teacher ratio is less than 30:1. \nHowever, the double shift system reduces the number of contact hours \nbetween  pupils  and  teachers.  Contact  hours  in  Bangladesh  are \napproximately 30% below the international average. The dropout rate is \nhigh,  averaging  33%,  due  partly  to  the  dire  poverty  experienced  by \nmany families and partly to the perception of many parents and children \nthat  schooling  is  of  little  value.  Average  attendance  rates  are  low  at \n61% overall. Girls\u2019 attendance is a little better than boys\u2019.  \n\nThese constraints mean that many children do not receive an adequate \nprimary  education.  Indeed,  the  current  completion  rate  is  estimated  at \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan  Amount  and \nTerms \n\n \n\nprimary  education.  Indeed,  the  current  completion  rate  is  estimated  at \nonly  67%,  while  no  more  than  64%  of  children starting grade 1 reach \ngrade 5 at the expected time. The average time to complete 5 years of \nprimary  education  is  approximately  6.5  years,  reflecting  low  internal \nefficiency  and  indicating  a  significant  wastage  of  scarce  resources. \nMany  children\u2014perhaps  the  majority\u2014and  even  those  \u201csuccessfully\u201d \ncompleting grade 5, do not attain acceptable standards of literacy and \nnumeracy, and many lapse into illiteracy once they leave school. Only \n5%  of  grade  5  pupils  attain  the  standards  required  for  the  primary \nscholarship examination.  \n\n \nThe  overall  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  universal  primary \neducation  and  contribute  to  sustainable  socioeconomic  development \nand  equity  in  Bangladesh  society  as  envisaged  in  the  MDGs.  The \nspecific  objective  is  to  provide  quality  primary  education  to  all  eligible \nchildren in Bangladesh.  \n \nThe  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $1.815  billion  equivalent,  of  which  $200 \nmillion  equivalent  (11%)  is  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $1.615  billion \nequivalent (89%) is local currency. \n \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n69 \n104 \n104 \n69 \n35 \n\n4 \n0 \n\n8 \n1,161 \n\n12 \n9 \n6 \n1 \n\n28 \n20 \n14 \n2 \n\n40 \n29 \n20 \n3 \n\n2.2 \n1.6 \n1.1 \n0.2 \n\n \nTotal \n100 \n150 \n150 \n100 \n50 \n\nPercent \n5.5 \n8.3 \n8.3 \n5.5 \n2.8 \n\nForeign \n \nExchange \nSource \n31 \nADB \n46 \nIDA   \n46 \nDFID \nEC \n31 \nGovernment of the  15 \n  Netherlands \nNORAD \nSida \nCIDA  \nGovernment of \n  Japan  JICA \nUNICEF/AusAID \nGovernment of \n  Bangladesh \n Total \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  CIDA  =  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency,  DFID  = \nDepartment  for  International  Development,  EC  =  European  Commission,  IDA  = \nInternational  Development  Association,  JICA  =  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, SIDA = Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency,  UNICEF  =  United  Nations  Children's \nFund.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  a  loan  in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR) \n72,031,000 from its Special Funds resources. The term of the loan will \nbe 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. ADB will finance 5.5% of the PEDP II costs, comprising $31 \nmillion  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $69  million  equivalent  of  the \n\n12 \n1,161 \n\n0.7 \n63.9 \n\n100.0 \n\n1,615 \n\n1,815 \n\n200 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nmillion  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $69  million  equivalent  of  the \nlocal  currency  cost.  Joint  grant  cofinancing  of  $389  million  equivalent \n(21%)  will  be  provided  from  the  following  sources:  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  $150  million  equivalent  (8.3%);  the \nEuropean  Commission  (EC),  $100  million  equivalent  (5.5%);  the \nGovernment of Netherlands, $50 million equivalent (2.8%); Norwegian \nAgency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),  $40 million equivalent \n(2.2%);  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency \n(Sida),  $29  million  equivalent  (1.6%);  and  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  $20  million  equivalent  (1.1%).  These \nfunds will be administered by ADB and subject to ADB guidelines and \nprocedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services  and  consultant \nselection.  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  is  considering \nproviding a credit of $150 million equivalent (or 8.3%) on standard IDA \nterms.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  considering  providing  through  the \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  parallel  cofinancing  of \n$3  million  equivalent  (0.2%).  The  United  Nations  Children's  Fund \n(UNICEF),  in  partnership  with  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID), is considering providing parallel cofinancing of \n$12  million  equivalent  (0.7%).  CIDA  is  considering  providing  an \nadditional  $20  million  equivalent  through  budgetary  support  to  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  will  provide  $1.161  billion  equivalent \n(63.9% of the total cost of PEDP II). \n \n\n  \nThe  Directorate  of  Primary  Education  (DPE),  acting  under  the  overall \nsupervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Primary  and  Mass  Education  (MOPME), \nwill be the Executing Agency (EA). \n \nMOPME  will  establish  a  program  steering  committee,  headed  by \nSecretary MOPME, to oversee the work of DPE and implementation of \nPEDP  II.  A  program  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  to \nsupport DPE in coordinating, implementing, and monitoring the PEDP II \nthrough DPE line divisions with the support of  technical support teams \n(TSTs).  At  the  regional  level,  divisions  and  districts  will  have  key \nsupervisory  and  support  roles  in  implementing  PEDP  II.  However, \nfunctional  authority  and \nincreasingly  during \nresponsibility will devolve to the Upazila (subdistrict) and school levels. \nThis  shift  in  the  locus  of  control  and  accountability  will  help  speed  up \nthe  development  process  and  improve  governance.

In  addition,  ADB,  as  the  lead  agency,  will  establish  a \nPEDP II Liaison Unit (PLU) within the Bangladesh Resident Mission to \nexclusively  administer  the  implementation  of  the  PEDP  II,  and  to \nfacilitate close liaison with the EA, its PCU, and development partners.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  under  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB) will be financed from the ADB loan and cofinanced grant \nfunds administered by ADB. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n\nthis  purpose  will  be  provided  during  PEDP \n\nimplementation, \n\nfor \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n31 December 2009 \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nfunds administered by ADB.

Local  procurement  will  follow  the \nGovernment\u2019s  new  Public  Procurement  Regulations  acceptable  to \nADB.  Under  PEDP  II,  civil  works  contracts  are  small  and  unlikely  to \nattract  the  interest  of  international  contractors.  They  will  therefore  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n\nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nConsulting Services  All  international  and  associated  domestic  consultants  will  be  financed \nfrom  the  ADB  loan  and  cofinanced  grant  funds  administered  by  ADB, \nand will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be applied in \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  A  total  input  of  about  700  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  over  1,000  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be provided. \n \nKey  improvements  will  include  a  reduced  pupil-teacher  ratio,  more \nquality textbooks and supplemental materials, better physical facilities, \nmore  pupil-teacher  contact  hours  for  teaching  and  learning  activities, \nand  quality  initial  and  in-service  training  programs  for  teachers  and \nhead  teachers,  appropriate  for  the  teaching  and  learning  of  basic \ncompetencies,  especially  literacy  and  numeracy,  and  other  foundation \nconcepts that underpin learning in everyday life, and later in secondary \nand  higher  education.  However,  none  of  these  improvements  will  be \nsustainable  unless  and  until  system  capacity  and  efficiency  are \nenhanced.  The  long-term  crosscutting  benefits  of  the  comprehensive \nsector program approach adopted will be improved organizational and \ninstitutional development and human resource development strategies, \nand  the  provision  of  additional  financial  and  other  resources.  These \nbenefits  will  ensure  greater \nlong-term  sustainability  of  primary \neducation services, in both technical and  financial terms. Ensuring that \nthese  improvements  reach  beyond  the  urban  areas  to  the  farthest \nregions  of  Bangladesh  will  help  overcome  the  barriers  caused  by \nremoteness and geography. Another crosscutting benefit of the sector \nprogram  approach  will  be  the  rapid  reduction  of  stand-alone project \nimplementation  units,  which  currently  tend  to  remove  key  education \nstaff \nin  off-budget  resource \nmanagement,  and  distort  staff  performance  reward  and  incentives \nsystems.  Harmonized  requirements  and  procedures  of  development \npartners  of  PEDP  II  in  financial  management,  reporting,  procurement, \naudits,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  progress  review  missions,  will \nresult \nthe  Government  and \ndevelopment  partners,  improved  coordination  between  all  parties,  and \nstrengthened  joint  participation  of  MOPME,  DPE,  and  stakeholders  of \nother levels in primary education annual planning.  \n \nOverall, the estimated immediate beneficiaries of PEDP II are (i) about \n16 million pupils in about 65,000 primary schools under the MOPME (ii) \n35,000 new primary school teachers who will receive initial training and \n(iii)  all  40,000  existing  untrained  primary  school  teachers  who  will \nreceive initial training. In addition, the target group of in-service training \nincludes all 320,000 existing trained primary school teachers and head \n\ntheir  regular  positions,  result \n\ntransaction  costs  of \n\nreduced \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvii \n\nincludes all 320,000 existing trained primary school teachers and head \nteachers,  including  primary  school  teachers  in  schools  under  the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) administration, who will receive in-service \ntraining  through  several  stages  during  PEDP  II.  Over  17  million  pupils \nin about 78,000 primary schools will benefit from the in-service training \nof their teachers. \n \nThe  Program  will  put  emphasis  on  improving  completion  rates,  which \nare low for both boys and girls. PEDP II includes cross-cutting gender \nstrategies in all components, and will assist the government to meet its \nquota  of  60%  female  teachers  in  primary  schools.  Gender  equality \ntraining will be included in teacher training.  \n \nThe  Government  is  implementing  within  the  PEDP  II  framework  an \nextensive  stipend  program  for  primary  education  targeting  poor \nchildren.  In  addition,  PEDP  II  has  specific  priority  interventions  to \nto  primary  education  by  poor,  disadvantaged, \nincrease  access \nindigenous, and refugee children to enhance their basic competencies \nand chances for secondary school education or vocational training and \nemployment  opportunities.  By  the  end  of  PEDP  II,  enrollment  of  poor \nchildren  is  expected  to  increase  by  2.7  million\u20133.2  million  poor \nstudents,  and  67\u201376%  (compared  with  55%  in  FY2001/02)  of  total \nPEDP II expenditure is expected to have been targeted to the poor.  \n \nTo  avoid  the  risks  and  problems  associated  with  coordination  and \nimplementation  of  numerous  separate  project  interventions,  and  the \nconsequent \ninterventions  on  quality \nimprovement,  the  design  of  PEDP  II  is  based  on  a  comprehensive \nsectorwide  program  approach  acknowledging  that  improvement  of \nquality  at  classroom  level  cannot  be  achieved  without  improvement at \nthe  systemic  level.  The  implementation  of  a  sectorwide  approach \nembodied in the PEDP II also entails significant risks. Risks have been \nanalyzed,  together  with  lessons  learned  from  previous  interventions, \nincluding  sectorwide  program  approaches,  and  a  detailed  risk \nmitigation  plan  has  been  developed  as  part  of  PEDP  II  design. \nOrganizational  development,  institutional  reform,  and  capacity  building \nwill be supported for efficient implementation of the program approach. \nWhile the Government is committed to the sectorwide approach, there \nis  the  risk  that  a  future  government  would  reverse  policy  decision  on \nthis  commitment.  However,  this  risk  is  not  considered  high,  since  the \nsector  approach  and  program  modalities  are  very  much  linked  with \nwider  long-term  development frameworks of Bangladesh, such as the \npoverty reduction strategy and medium-term expenditure framework.  \n \nFinancial  sustainability  was  confirmed  by  (i)  reviewing  the  general \nadequacy  of  the  existing  revenue  expenditure  budget  allocation  to \nsupport  the  recurrent  cost  of  delivering  public  primary  education \nservices,  and  (ii)  analyzing  the  implications  of  the  recurring  cost  of \nPEDP  II  investments.  The  possibility  of  corruption  has  also  been \naddressed.  PEDP  II  includes  measures  to  ensure  better  governance \nand  efficiency  in  system  performance,  and  transparency  in  financial \nand procurement management.   \n\nimpact  of  such \n\nlack  of \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Primary  Education  Development \nProgram (PEDP II).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\n  \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nBangladesh has one of the largest primary education systems in the world. The strong \nnational  commitment  to  education  over  the  past  15  years  is  evident  in  the  rapid  growth  in \nparticipation and completion rates and strong overall growth in the system of primary education \nas  a  whole.  In  the  year  2001,  17.7  million  pupils  were  enrolled  in  over  78,000  primary-level \ninstitutions  and  taught  by  more  than  320,000  teachers.2 This enrollment represented a 30.8% \nincrease  in  the  formal  primary  education  sector  over  the  level  in  1991.  The gross enrollment \nratio  rose  steadily  to  reach  97.5%  in  2001,  girls\u2019  enrollment  being  slightly  higher  than  boys\u2019. \nOfficial data suggest an overall net enrollment ratio of about 81%. \n \n3. \nThe  overall  pupil-to-teacher  ratio  is  about  55:1,  but  is  67:1  in  Government  primary \nschools (GPS). With the double shift system operating in 90% of primary schools, the pupils-in-\nclass-to-teacher ratio is less than 30:1. However, the double shift system reduces the number of \ncontact  hours  between  pupils  and  teachers.  Official  data  on  pupil  contact  hours  in  primary \neducation place Bangladesh approximately 30% below the international average of 5,367 hours, \nand  the  situation  is  worse  in  some  areas  and  schools.  The  high  dropout  rate,  averaging  33%, \nresults partly from the dire poverty experienced by many families and partly from the perception \nof many parents and children that schooling is of little value. Reported average attendance rates \nare  low  at  61%  overall.  Girls\u2019  attendance  is  a  little  better  than  boys\u2019  in  both  urban  and  rural \nareas.  Attendance  in  urban  schools  is  64.3%,  which  is  significantly  higher  than  the  56.5% \nreported for rural schools. Children who do attend school regularly go to schools that generally \nlack physical infrastructure and teaching and learning materials. Most have only three relatively \nsmall  classrooms  with  no  storage  space,  and  furniture  that  is  unsuitable  for  use  with  activity-\noriented teaching and learning methods required in primary education.  \n \n4. \nThese  shortcomings  mean  that  many  children  do  not  receive  adequate  primary \neducation. Indeed, the current completion rate is estimated at only 67% while no more than 64% \nof children starting grade 1 will reach grade 5 in the expected time. The average time taken to \ncomplete  the  5  years  of  primary  education  is  approximately  6.5  years,  reflecting  low internal \nefficiency and significant wastage of scarce resources. Achievement testing and research also \nsuggest  that  many  children,  perhaps  the  majority  and  even  those  \u201csuccessfully\u201d  completing \ngrade  5,  do  not  attain  acceptable  standards  of  literacy  and  numeracy,  and  many  lapse  into \nilliteracy  once  they  leave  school.  Only  5%  of  grade  5  pupils  are  able  to  attain  the  standard \nrequired for the Primary Scholarship Examination. In addition to a declining primary age cohort, \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Technical  assistance  (TA)  from  DFID \n(Department  for  International  Development),  NORAD  (Norwegian  Agency  Development  Cooperation),  UNICEF \n(United Nations Children's Fund), European Commission (EC), Government of Netherlands, and World Bank (WB) \ncontributed  to  the  joint  preparation  process  coordinated  by  the  ADB  PPTA.

These  pupil,  school,  and  teacher  numbers  in  para  2 \nreflect the primary education system as a whole including schools under Ministry of Primary and Mass Education \n(MOPME), and Madrasah (religious) schools under Ministry of Education (MOE).  \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nthe lack of quality in the GPS is perceived to be a major factor in recent declines in enrollment. \nPEDP II seeks to improve the efficiency and quality of primary education as both a foundation \nfor  effective  economic  development  and  as  a  poverty  reduction  mechanism.  The  PEDP  II \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nAccess and Equity \n\n5. \nThe low quality of primary education is one of the gravest development problems facing \nBangladesh  at  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century.  Government,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and other agencies of civil society acknowledge the many problems facing the system \nand  challenging  all  efforts  to  build  a  high-quality  primary  education  subsector.  Indeed,  during \n1997\u20132003, development partners have worked with the Government on a number of projects \nto alleviate some of the problems. However, focus has been on increasing access rather than \nimproving  the  quality  of  education.  The  analysis  of  the  many  problems  and  challenges,  and \nvarious  government  actions  being  taken  to  overcome  them  are  in  Appendix 2. Summary is in \nparas. 6\u20139. Problem and constraints analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \n \n6. \nDemand  side  problems  and  constraints\u2014e.g.,  poverty,  direct  costs  of  schooling, \nopportunity costs, special needs of some children, social and cultural constraints and prejudices \n\u2014prevent  children  from  going  to  school  or  from  benefiting  fully  from  the  educational  services \nprovided  by  the  school.  Poor  and  working  children,  girls,  tribal  minorities,  disabled  children, \nchildren  in  different  geographic  and  educational  environments,  and  refugee  children  are  at \nparticular risk of being marginalized in the formal education system and require specific targeted \nstrategies  to  achieve  equitable  enrollment,  completion,  and  attainment. In Bangladesh 40% of \nthe  population  live  below  the  poverty  line,  and  another  20\u201330%  are  close  to  poverty.  Hence, \npoverty is probably the most important single factor negatively impacting children\u2019s participation \nin  schooling.  Poverty  is  widespread  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  but  its  greatest  relative \nimpact is in the remote regions and tribal communities of the hill tracts. \n \n \n \n7. \nSupply-side constraints encompass aspects of the school and classroom that limit their \ncapacity  to  offer  adequate  and  quality  education  to  children  in  the  area.  In  Bangladesh,  these \nconstraints include barriers limiting access to schools; short contact hours; inadequate facilities \nincluding  poorly  maintained  buildings,  and  lack  of  sanitation  facilities  and  safe drinking water; \nuntrained or poorly trained teachers using inappropriate teaching methods; lack of teaching and \nlearning  resources;  teacher  absenteeism,  etc.  Many  children  begin  their  schooling  in  satellite \nschools that occupy rented premises and where untrained and poorly qualified members of the \ncommunity teach without the aid of any resources, except perhaps textbooks. Even the majority \nof the children who live close to a GPS often find that their schools lack classrooms, teaching \nand  learning  resources,  and  facilities.  The  lack  of  classrooms  and  teachers  means  that  the \nmajority of schools work on a \u201cshift\u201d system , with classes 1 and 2 attending in the morning and \nclasses  3,  4,  and  5  in  the  afternoon.  Contact  hours  are  thereby  reduced  at  each  level.  Hence \nteachers  do  not  have  enough  space  and  time  to  teach  effectively  and  provide  pupils  with \nindividual attention to solve learning difficulties and provide remedial help.  \n \nMany  teachers,  even  in  the  GPS,  and  a  larger  proportion  of  those  in  other  types  of \n8. \nschools  are  untrained;  those  that  have  been  trained,  have  been  poorly  trained.  The  lack  of \nteacher quality can be traced back to a low standard of preservice or initial teacher training, and \na similarly low standard of in-service training and professional development. These problems, in \n\nQuality \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n3. \n\nSystemic Problems \n\nturn, have their root cause in the poor quality of the primary education teacher training institutes \n(PTIs),  the  lack  of  resources  at  Upazila  (subdistrict)  level,  lack  of  effective  monitoring  and \nteacher supervision resulting in teacher absenteeism, and lack of leadership from the National \nAcademy  for  Primary  Education  (NAPE)  and  the  National  Curriculum  and  Textbook  Board \n(NCTB). The majority of primary teachers are men (about 62%) and so schools lack the caring \nethos  that  is  typical  of  primary  schools  staffed  by  female  teachers  and  which  is  regarded  as \nmost  suitable  for  young  children.  In  brief,  the  school  does  not  offer  an  environment  that \nfacilitates  and  encourages  good  learning.  The  enormity  of  this  problem  is  evident,  given  that \nprimary education is the foundation on which all other schooling and education is based. \n \n \n \nInstitutional  constraints  are  policies  and  administrative  arrangements  that  prevent \n9. \nchildren from attending school or performing at an acceptable level and limit the capacity of the \nschool  to  provide  effective  education.  Some  examples  are  the  double  shift  system,  weak \norganizational  capacity \nthe  Directorate  of  Primary  Education  (DPE),  an \norganizational  culture  that  does  not  properly  value  primary  education,  the  overly  centralized \nmanagement  and  decision  making,  staffing  policies\u2014especially  the  policy  of  frequent \ntransfers\u2014that lead to discontinuity and inefficiency, inadequate funding arrangements, inability \nto make the most effective use of available funds, and lack of linkages between the formal and \nsubformal  sectors.  All  these  problems  are  evident  in  Bangladesh,  and  all  are  reflected  in  the \nlack  of  quality  in  primary  education  now  available  to  children  throughout  the  country.  The \noverriding  view  is  that  bringing  together  the  Government  and  all  major  partners  and \nstakeholders  under  a  common  framework  and  comprehensive  program,  including  institutional \nreforms, in primary education will better support (i) sector development led and managed by the \nGovernment;  (ii)  a  comprehensive  sector  policy  reform  framework;  (iii)  rationalized  sector \ntargets  that  are  appropriately  integrated  into  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-  Term  Expenditure \nFramework  (MTEF);  and  (iv)  more  cost-effective  use  of  available  sector  resources,  including \nbalancing  the  recurrent  budget  in  favor  of  nonsalary  expenditure,  which  is  essential  for \nsustainable improvement of the quality of primary education as a whole. \n \n\nthroughout \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPORT  TO THE PEDP II \n\n10. \nThe  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  Bangladesh  focuses  on  human \ndevelopment  through  basic  education  as  part  of  the  overall  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The \noperational  strategy  for  the  education  sector  aims  to  (i)  increase  equitable  access  to  basic \neducation,  particularly  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups;  (ii)  improve  educational  quality  and \nsystem  efficiency,  particularly  in  teacher  training;  (iii)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  to \ndeliver  basic  and  secondary  education;  and  (iv)  support  decentralization  and  community \ninvolvement in education.  \n \n11. \nAt  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  played  the  lead  role  in  helping  the  Ministry  of \nPrimary and Mass Education (MOPME) prepare for PEDP II. Development partners and other \nstakeholders  have  been  working  with  the  Government  and  ADB  to  arrive  at  a  jointly  designed \nand agreed upon PEDP II macro plan for primary education, consisting of a policy and reform \nframework,  strategies,  program,  and  an  investment  plan  for  2003\u20132009, including subsector \nperformance indicators, priorities for investments, and capacity building. This plan builds heavily \non lessons learned during PEDP I, and from recent ADB-funded projects in primary education. \nA  summary  is  in  Appendix  3.  Lessons  learned from a sectorwide program approach (SWAP) \napplied  currently  in  the  health  sector  in  Bangladesh  have  been  incorporated  in  the  PEDP  II \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\ndesign  as  well  as  lessons  learned  from  Pakistan's  Social  Action  Program3.  Details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n12. \nCompared  with  PEDP  I,  PEDP  II  is  a  more  integrated  and  coordinated  subsector \nprogram.  PEDP  II  will  focus  on  improving  the  quality  of  primary  education  and  will  promote \norganizational  and  institutional  development  necessary  to  support  coordination,  subsector \nplanning,  management,  and  monitoring  to  ensure  efficient  improvement  of  quality.  PEDP  II \nincludes  a  common  set  of  key  performance  indicators  and  a  common  framework  for  support \nfrom the Government and development partners. PEDP II interventions will be supported by a \ncomprehensive policy and institutional reform framework (Appendix 4). The framework has also \nwider  sectoral  linkages  with  secondary  education,  such  as  restructuring  and  organizational \ndevelopment of the institutions dealing with both primary and secondary education. PEDP II has \nbeen designed to be a catalyst for achieving holistic, sectorwide planning in the whole education \nsector in the long term. \n \n13.  While  at  the  systemic  level  PEDP  II  will  focus  on  formal  primary  education where the \nvast  majority  of  the  children  are  enrolled,  it  will  also  promote  Government\u2019s  Education  for  All \n(EFA),  achievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  and  the  poverty  reduction \nagenda.  PEDP  II  promotes  common  learning  standards  for  all  types  of  primary  schools,  in \nGovernment  schools  and  NGO  schools.  This  approach  will  assist  the  Government  in \nharmonizing the development and quality improvement of the various subsystems and promote \nbetter primary education across the country.  \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s  sector  loan  modality  is  considered  the  most  appropriate  method  of  financing \nPEDP  II.4  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan  criteria  have  been  met.  The  Government  has  prepared  and \nendorsed,  jointly  with  development  partners  and  in  consultation  with  other  stakeholders,  a \ncomprehensive PEDP II macro plan to meet the priority needs of the subsector. The capability \nof  sector  institutions  will  be  supported  to  implement  the  plan.  Government\u2019s  policies  for  the \nsector  will  be  further  strengthened.  The  ADB  sector  loan,  together  with  support  from  other \ndevelopment  partners,  will  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  PEDP  II.  PEDP  II,  and  the \nADB sector loan are in line with ADB\u2019s education policy and country strategy. \n \nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n15. \nPEDP  II  will  assist  the  Government  to  promote  EFA  and  its  poverty  reduction  agenda, \nwhich  are  linked  with  the  MDGs.  PEDP  II  has  an  overall  goal  of  reducing  poverty  through \nuniversal  primary  education  and  contributing  to  sustainable  socioeconomic  development and \nequity  in  Bangladesh  society  as  envisaged  in  the  MDGs.  The  specific  objective  is  to  provide \nquality primary education to all eligible children in Bangladesh.  \n  \nB. \n\nComponents and Outcomes \n\nPEDP \n\nII  has \n\nfour  components:  (i)  quality \n\n16. \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  quality  improvement  in  schools  and  classrooms,          \n(iii) quality improvement through infrastructure development, and (iv) improving and supporting \nequitable access to quality schooling. \n \n17.  \nImplementation  will  encompass  development  activities  at  central  Government  level,  as \nwell  as  at  school  community,  Upazila  and  district  levels  in  all  64  districts  of  the  country.  The \n\nthrough  organizational \n\nimprovement \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2001. Project Performance Audit Report on the Social Action Program (Sector) Project. Manila. \n4  The concept \u201cprogram\u201d is used instead of \u201cproject\u201d to emphasize the sectorwide program approach of PEDP II, and \n\nbecause it encompasses all external support to PEDP II. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\nrationale  and  outline  of  the  components  are  in  paras.  18\u201337.  A  detailed  description  of  the \ncomponents is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n\n1. \n\nQuality Improvement through Organizational Development and Capacity \nBuilding \n\n18. \nPEDP  I  established  the  absolute  importance  of  policy  development,  institutional  and \norganizational  reform,  and  capacity  building  if  interventions  implemented  through  any \ndevelopment  program  are  to  be  sustainable  in  the  longer  term.  PEDP  I  has  also  shown  the \nnecessity of institutionalizing development programs within the organizational and administrative \nframework of MOPME and DPE. Only in this way can the formal system gain full ownership of \nthe  changes  and  reforms  that  are  offered  through  the  development  programs.  As  a  result  of \nthese  experiences  and  lessons,  PEDP  II  places  the  highest  priority  on  capacity  building  and \nsystemic  reform  and  has  determined  that  capacity  building  should  preferably  precede,  may \noccur  concurrently  with,  but  should  never  follow,  interventions  aimed  at  quality  improvement. \nThe  interventions  in  the  component  have  been  designed  to  meet  the  increasing  operational \ndemands that come with a shift in focus from access to quality improvement and to ensure the \nnecessary level of institutional support for development programs.  \n \n19. \nA distinctive thrust of PEDP II is to increase authority and accountability, including good \ngovernance  and  the  need  to  address  fiscal  and  supervisory  irregularities  in  the  subsector.    A \ncomprehensive  organizational  and  institutional  review  and  analysis  of  MOPME,  DPE  and  all \nprimary education institutions at national and all other levels will be completed at an early stage \nof  PEDP  II  implementation.  Organizational  and  institutional  capacity  building  needs  of  the \ninstitutions  will  be  determined  in  detail  to  provide  a  quality  primary  education  system  and  to \nundertake  more  effectively  their  present  and  future  roles  and  functions  in  primary  education \npolicy-making,  planning,  management,  system  support,  and  monitoring.  Based  on  the  review \nand  analysis,  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  restructuring  and  capacity  building  will  be \nimplemented during PEDP II.   \n \n20. \nFundamental to the process of quality improvement in primary education is the principle \nof  decentralizing  and  devolving  authority  and  responsibility  to  middle  and  local  levels  of  the \neducation  system.  The  initiatives  in  component  1  are  designed  to  strongly  support  further \ndecentralization and devolution. PEDP II aims to enhance resources at school level to achieve \nquality improvement in learning and equitable access. In line with this approach, key outreach \nand  support  mechanisms  will  be  developed  at  the  Upazila  level.  Teachers,  head  teachers,   \nschool management committee (SMC) members, Upazila education officers (UEOs), assistant \nUpazila  education  officers  (AUEOs),  and  staff  of  Upazila  Resource  Centers  (URCs)  will  be \nprovided training opportunities emphasizing that PEDP II is a unified effort with one set of goals, \ninterventions, and procedures and with one line of management\u2014the regular line running from \nDPE  to  division,  district,  Upazila  and  school.  This  means  that  all  interventions  to  be \nimplemented in the field  \u2014especially  in  schools  and  Upazilas\u2014need  to  be  in  one  strand  and \nshould be coordinated with other strands at district and higher levels. \n \n21. \nAdditional functions will be assigned to schools and Upazilas, which will be strengthened \nthrough provision of infrastructure, staff training and capacity building. In each Upazila, existing \nand  new  AUEOs  and  the  URC  staff  will  be  trained  to  work  together  as  a  team  to  meet  these \nnew  responsibilities.  This  enhanced  Upazila  education  team  will  inspire,  train,  and  support \nSMCs,  head  teachers,  and  teachers  in  their  roles  to  improve  the  quality  of  learning  and  to \nprovide quality primary education to all children. The enhanced responsibilities at Upazila level \nwill call for professional support and guidance from district level. It is, therefore, essential during \nthe  PEDP  II  period  to  strengthen  the  District  Primary  Education  Office  by  creating  a  small \nprimary  education  technical  team  to  lead,  train,  professionally  support,  and  coordinate  the \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nUpazilas.  During  PEDP  II,  this  new  capacity  will  be  made  part  of  the  regular  organizational \nstructure for primary education.  \n\n2. \n\nQuality Improvement in Schools and Classrooms \n\nThe  interventions  supported  by  this  component  represent  the  core  quality  inputs  of    \n\n22. \nPEDP  II.  These  interventions  reach  all  parts  of  the  primary  school  system  and  will  provide \npositive  support  for  quality  improvement  at  all  levels.  The  complex  nature  of  the  education \nsystem  means  that  improvements  in  student  learning  and  outcomes  can  only  arise  from \nimprovements  elsewhere.  The  system  has  to  change.  The  interventions  of  this  component, \naffecting  as  they  do  the  schools  and  classrooms,  teachers  and  head  teachers,  teaching  and \nlearning materials and other resources, the support institutions such as NAPE, NCTB, Primary \nEducation  Teacher  Training  Institutes  (PTIs),  URCs,  and  district  offices,  as  well  as  the \ncommunities in which the schools are located\u2014provide the framework and substance for those \nchanges.  \n\n \n23. \nPEDP I has demonstrated that quality improvement in Bangladesh\u2019s primary schools will \nrequire  many  coordinated  interventions,  including  greater  responsiveness  to  classroom \ncircumstances  and  the  learning  environment.  Indeed,  improving  the  learning  environment  in \nschools  to  provide  the  foundation  for  an  improved  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  is  a  key \nobjective  of  PEDP  II.  The  interventions  under  this  component  are  designed  to  ensure  that  all \nschools meet the primary school quality level (PSQL) criteria: schooling in classrooms that are \nnot overcrowded, suitable staff-student ratios, regular attendance by teachers, one teacher for \neach class or section, and sufficient contact hours to allow quality teaching and learning to take \nplace. \n \n24. \nBoth  NCTB  and  NAPE  have  key  responsibilities  in  providing  primary  education  and \ntherefore  must  play  a  key  role  in  quality  improvement.  Both  organizations  will  undergo \norganizational  reform  and  capacity  building  to  develop  the  resources  and  skills  necessary  to \nproperly  meet  their  obligations  and  responsibilities.  Academic  and  technical  support  will \nstrengthen  the  Primary  Curriculum  Wing  of  NCTB  and  improve  primary  education  through  the \nprovision  of  quality  textbooks  and  materials  appropriate  to  particular  grade  levels,  curriculum \ndevelopment and evaluation, and testing and  assessment. NCTB will be supported in its efforts \nto  promote  continuous  school-based  assessment  as  an  aid  to  better  teaching  and  improved \nlearning.  \n \n25. \nDespite many constraints, not the least of them the discontinuity of its professional staff, \nNAPE\u2019s mandate to offer a model of capacity building for teacher education and improvement of \nquality in the education system remains a valid one. NAPE will be invested with authority as an \nautonomous  body  and  provided  with  a  stable  staff  of  well-prepared  specialists  to  fulfill  its \nmission  as  an  apex  institution.  In  turn,  systemic  reform,  capacity  building,  and  organizational \nreform of NAPE will be supported to enhance its role of setting standards for teacher education \nand engaging in training to effectively and efficiently deliver primary education nationwide.  \n \n26. \nHowever, little of the organizational reform will have much positive impact on children if \nthey are denied the essential tools for learning, in particular literacy. Hence, a basic package of \nteaching aids and core and supplementary reading and learning materials will be provided to all \nGPS,  registered  nongovernment  primary  schools  (RNGPS),  and  community  schools,  including \nsatellite schools. Teachers will be provided with texts, relevant curriculum documents, teachers\u2019 \nguides, aids, and equipment necessary for each class and subject taught. Furthermore, support \nwill be given to ensure that pupils continue to have free texts for every subject and that the texts \nare available from the first day of the school year.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nThe  performance  of  teachers  is  seen  as  the  most  important  element  in  a  quality \n27. \neducation  system.  Support  will  be  provided  for  ensuring  appropriate  minimum  criteria  for \nrecruiting trainee teachers, an appropriate minimum level of standards for training teachers, and \na  registration  system  for  trained  teachers.  An  appropriate  balance  between  initial  teacher \ntraining  and  in-service  training  will  be  emphasized.  Support  will  be  provided  to  improve  initial \nteacher  training  to  include  both  theory  and  practice  and  involve regular periods of supervised \npracticum in schools. To achieve this will require an improved system of initial teacher training, \ntogether  with  a  program  of  extension,  upgrading,  and  refurbishment  of  the  existing  PTIs  to \nexpand  the  capacity  to  meet  immediate  teacher  supply  targets  and  the  longer-term  targets \nrequired by EFA policy.  \n \n28. \nSupport  will  be  provided  for  reviewing  and  improving  the  incentives  and  rewards  for \nprimary  teachers  to  encourage  them  to  maintain  and  enhance  their  professional  skills  through \nprograms  of  in-service  training  and  courses  for  further  qualification.  Support  for  existing \nteachers will ensure regular, preferably annual, professional development or in-service training. \nTherefore,  subcluster  training  will  be  strongly  supported.  The  in-service program will continue \nthe  earlier  initiatives  of  PEDP  I  to  assist  teachers  to  adopt  child-centered methods to improve \nteaching quality and pupil learning. Texts, teachers' guides, aids, and equipment for each grade \nlevel and subject taught will be provided. Teacher supervision in the field, in coordination with \nthe  in-service  training  provided,  will  be  important  for  quality  improvement  and  will  be \nstrengthened, drawing lessons from PEDP I projects and also from successful NGO projects. \n \n29. \nThe  quality  and  authority  of  head  teachers  are  strong  indicators  of  quality  schools.  To \nachieve  and  maintain  the  proposed  quality  standards  under  PEDP  II,  head  teachers  will  be \ntrained  in  school  management,  teacher  support  and  supervision,  community  mobilization and \nparticipation, and in other areas necessary to facilitate and support quality teaching and learning \nin all grades and classes. SMCs and PTIs will play a significant role in community mobilization, \nwith support from head teachers. Support will be provided for improving selection and promotion \nof  well-qualified  candidates,  including  qualified  female  teachers,  for  head  teacher  positions  as \nwell as for the reviewing the need to provide them with adequate rewards and incentives. \n \n30. \nThe  original  intention  for  the  URCs  was  to  establish  institutions  at  the  Upazila  level  for \nin-service  training  of  primary  teachers.  However,  only  about  20%  of  the  planned  purpose-built \nURCs  were  constructed  under  the  various  PEDP  I  projects.  Under  PEDP  II,  the  URC  building \nand implementation program will be completed to provide the necessary sites for the in-service \nteacher training activities and to suggest modifications to their role and the ways in which they \nmay  be  used,  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  organizational  and  institutional analysis. \nThere is sufficient evidence to pursue further under PEDP II the original plan for URCs, but with \nan  improved  concept  of  how  to  develop  them  as  key  outreach  and  support  mechanisms  for \nteachers\u2019 continuous professional development. \n \n31. \nEmphasis will be given to the role of the community in increasing the quality of primary \neducation. The community will be mobilized to increase  public and community awareness of its \nrole  in  supporting,  monitoring,  and  advocating  quality  standards  and  improvements  in  their \nschools.  Importance  will  continue  to  be  attached  to  the  role  of  the  SMCs  as  a  planning  and \nsupport mechanism for the schools. Communities will be encouraged to participate with SMCs \nin  developing  school  level  improvement  plans  (SLIPs).  Experience  gained  by  NGOs  in \nsuccessful community mobilization will be utilized. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nQuality Improvement through Infrastructure Development \n\n3. \n \n32. \nTo meet the demand for higher quality teaching and learning, existing infrastructure will \nbe  improved.  New  infrastructure,  facilities,  furnishings,  and  equipment  as  necessary  will  be \nprovided  in  Government  education  offices,  PTIs,  URCs,  and  schools.  The  importance  of  the \nappropriate  type  of  construction  and  facilities  for  schools  will  be  stressed  in  line  with  PSQL \nrequirements.  Planning  and  implementing  maintenance  on  a  routine  cyclical  basis  will  be \nsupported  to  ensure  the  longevity  of  the  existing  infrastructure,  facilities,  and  equipment.     \nPEDP  II  offers  an  opportunity  to  provide  the  required  infrastructure  to  facilitate  the  shifts  in \nteaching and learning styles that are necessary if Bangladesh is to overcome the achievement \ndeficit that is so apparent. In constructing new classrooms, priority will be given to remote areas, \nunderserved  areas,  and  areas  of  indigenous  people.  The  component  brings  together  all  the \ninterventions in other components to improve physical infrastructure, including the provision of \nseparate  latrines  for  girls  and  boys,  water  supply,  boundary  walls,  and  basic  furniture  (chairs, \ntables,  blackboards,  etc.).  It  does  not  include  the  provision  of  equipment  such  as  computer \nworkstations,  communications  equipment,  which  are  provided  under \nthe  appropriate \ncomponents. \n \n\nImproving and Supporting Equitable Access to Quality Schooling \n\n4. \n \nBangladesh has long recognized, in both constitution and policy, the right of each child \n33. \nto  education.  The  gains  made  over  the  past  decade  in  the  effort  to  ensure  universal  primary \neducation  are  highly  commended  internationally.  However,  several  million  more  children  are \nunable to access or to successfully participate in and complete primary education. The ultimate \nsuccess of education as a key part of the strategies to reduce poverty and build a cohesive and \nequitable  society  will  ultimately  be  reflected  in  the  extent  to  which  marginalized children and \ngroups within the community are able to participate fully in all spheres of society and economic \nlife. Their participation in formal primary education is a crucial first step on this pathway. But, for \nthis  to  happen,  there  must  be  a  supportive  policy  and  institutional  environment  at  the  highest \nlevels of the education system. \n \n34. \nSupport under this component seeks to rapidly and significantly enhance the institutional \ncapacity  of  DPE  at  central  and  other  levels  to  meet  the  needs  of  children  with  special \nrequirements  to  access,  enjoy,  and  complete  primary  education  through  the  formal  sector. \nSupport  will  be  provided  for  policy  reforms  and  interventions  that  will  reduce  the  demand-side \nand  supply-side  constraints  that  prevent  millions  of  children  from  accessing  and  participating \nfully  and  successfully  in  formal  primary  education.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  presents  a \nsummary of the Government\u2019s stipend programs. The Stipend Program for Primary Education is \na key intervention within the PEDP II framework for overcoming the poverty barrier to education \naccess. During PEDP II, the criteria for eligibility for various funds available under the PEDP II \nframework,  including  criteria  for  eligibility  for  stipends  under  the  Stipend  Program,  and  its \ngender implications, will be reviewed, and adjusted as necessary.  \n \n35. \nPEDP II will also support the implementation of the Rangamati Declaration of Education \npertaining to primary education in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) area and areas with indigenous \npeople.  MOPME  will  collaborate  with  the  Ministry  of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Affairs  in \nimplementing  PEDP  II  in  the  CHT  area.  Flexibility  in  the  criteria  for  recruiting  teachers, \nespecially  female  teachers,  applied  elsewhere  in  the  country  will  be  adopted.  Also  flexibility in \nrecruiting teachers from indigenous people, as well as supplementary learning materials in the \nlocal language will be included in PEDP II. Appendix 5 includes the summary poverty reduction \nand social analysis. Gender strategy is in Supplementary  Appendix G. An Indigenous People's \nDevelopment Framework is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million children in Bangladesh have some form of disability. About 60% \n36. \nof them could attend primary school with little or no adaptations, and 20 % could attend a formal \nprimary  school  with  some  adaptations.  PEDP  II  proposes  to  establish  posts  in  special  needs \neducation  within  the  Policy  and  Operations  Division  of  DPE,  as  well  as  new  posts  for  one \nspecial  needs  education  advisor  in  each  district.  A  task  force  will  be  established  to  devise \nstrategies  for  mainstreaming  children  with  special  needs  into  primary  schools.  Annual  events \nwill be planned and implemented at the school level during Education Week to raise awareness \nof good health for good education, provide referral services for children with special needs, and \nfacilitate  early  detection  and  inclusion  of  children  with  disabilities.  PEDP  II  will  also  provide \nsupport  for  training  teachers  and  head  teachers  of  children  with  special  needs,  encourage \nadditional pedagogical support at the school level for these children, and promote the role of the \ncommunity in meeting the needs of these children. \n \n37. \nAccess to quality formal primary education will be improved and supported by creating a \nfund to provide innovation grants to support practical and creative ways to enhance the quality \nof education for working children and those living in poverty, especially those in urban areas; for \nchildren with disabilities; and for children from minority communities. This flexible pool of funding \nwill finance innovative programs based on collaboration between communities, government, and \ncivil society. Grants will be awarded for new proposals, or for continuing and expanding existing \ninnovations. Under this component, facilitation and support for innovative pilots emphasizing a \nshift from social mobilization to deeper social development will be very important for the PEDP II \nstrategy. Details of various school-level grants in PEDP II are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nC. \n \n38. \nPEDP  II  is  a  comprehensive  program;  the  first  such  program  in  primary  education  in \nBangladesh.  The  PEDP  II  approach  is  essentially  a  systems  approach  that  covers  the  entire \nsubsector.  ADB  as  the  lead  development  partner  will  use  its  sector  loan  modality  to  bring \ntogether  resources  from  major  development  partners  through  joint  cofinancing  arrangements \nand  thus  adopt  a  much  broader  development  perspective  than  might  have  been  possible  by \nacting alone through a conventional project mode of working.  PEDP II includes design features \nthat emphasize gender and social development as crosscutting dimensions in its components. \nSpecial  task  forces  and  advisory  committees  will  be  established  to  assist  in  preparing  and \nimplementing  actions  plans  for  gender,  vulnerable  groups,  and  indigenous  people.  PEDP  II  is \nalso  unique  in  the  Bangladesh  context  in  that  while  being  fundamentally  pro-poor  and  pro-\ndisadvantaged children, it is also national in its vision. PEDP II seeks to create the environment \nfor  nationwide  improvement  in  primary  education.  The  broad  program  perspective  does  carry \nspecial responsibilities. ADB, having led the PEDP II planning process will now lead in ensuring \nthat  the  program  implementation  arrangements  are  user-friendly  while  meeting  standards for \ngood governance and financial management. PEDP II will improve on the previous fragmented \nprojectized approach of PEDP I by bringing the Government and development partners together \nunder one coherent program.  The transaction costs of both the Government and development \npartners  are  reduced  and  efficiency  of  the  coordination  increased  through  harmonized \nrequirements  and  procedures  of  development  partners  in  financial  management,  reporting, \nprocurement, audits, monitoring and evaluation, and progress review missions. This partnership \nof the Government and its development partners is a powerful impetus for reform. \n \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nD.  Cost Estimates \n\n39. \nThe total cost of PEDP II is estimated at $1.815 billion equivalent, of which $200 million \n(11%) equivalent comprises foreign  exchange,  and  $1.615  billion  (89%)  equivalent  comprises \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nlocal  currency.

The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  Based on a \nreview  of  historical  financing  trends,  macroeconomic  forecasts  of  the  International  Monetary \nFund  (IMF)  and  the  Government,  and  priorities  as  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  National \nPoverty Reduction Strategy and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), it is estimated \nthat  Government  counterpart  financing  can  be  made  available  in  the  order  of  $1.1\u20131.2 billion  \n(inclusive of the Government\u2019s stipend program) for the six-year PEDP II period. \n\n \n41. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $100 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources.  The  term  of  the  loan  will  be  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB \nwill finance 5.5% of the PEDP II costs, comprising $31 million of the foreign exchange cost, and \n$69 million of the local currency cost.  Joint grant cofinancing of $389 million equivalent (21%) \nwill be provided from the following sources: Department for International Development (DFID), \n$150 million equivalent (8.3%); the European Commission (EC), $100 million equivalent (5.5%); \nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands,  $50  million  equivalent  (2.8%);  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment  Cooperation  (NORAD),  $40  million  equivalent  (2.2%);  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  $29  million  equivalent  (1.6%);  and  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  $20  million  equivalent  (1.1%).  These  funds  will  be \nadministered  by  ADB  and  subject  to  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures  for  procuring  goods and \nservices  and  selecting  consultants.  The  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  is \nconsidering providing a credit of $150 million equivalent (or 8.3%) on standard IDA terms. The \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nGovernment  of  Japan  is  considering  providing  through  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency  (JICA)  parallel  cofinancing  of  $3  million  equivalent  (0.2%).

It  is  imperative,  therefore,  that  a  dedicated \norganizational  unit  supports  the  executing  agency  (EA)  in  keeping  close  track  of,  and  control \nover,  the  many  activities  until  they  can  be  more  fully  absorbed  into  the  Government\u2019s \norganizational  structures  and  institutionalized  as  part  of  routine  service  delivery.  The \norganizational  structure  designed  for  managing  PEDP  II  will  encourage  and  provide  for  a \nholistic,  cohesive,  and  integrated  subsector  approach  in  which  the  whole  plan\u2014its  goals, \nstrategies, and outcomes\u2014will be kept in view and not just the specifics of separate  elements. \nAs  PEDP  II  gains  momentum,  adjustments  will  be  inevitable  to  respond  to  shifting  conditions, \nnew insights, and unforeseen events. While many issues can, and should be dealt with at the \nlower levels of Upazilas and districts, central guidance, oversight, and decision making will be \nrequired to ensure that PEDP II focus and integrity are maintained.  \n\n \n43. \nA  central  process  of  continual  review  will  be  instituted  so  that  lessons  derived  through \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  are  reflected  in  continuing  changes  to  PEDP  II  plans  and \nimplementation.  This  is  particularly  important  since  PEDP  II  represents  a  shift  of  focus  from \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\naccess  and  participation  to  quality  improvement,  with  emphasis  on  student  achievement  and \nquality of outcomes. This means that the primary sector cannot continue doing simply more of \nthe same, but must incorporate new dimensions, inputs, and processes not currently offered or \nsupported. Consequently, assistance will be needed to both develop and transform services and \ntheir delivery. Through MOPME and DPE, PEDP II creates the opportunity for the government \nto  review  current  operational  systems  and  procedures  and  to  institutionalize  \u201cbest  practice.\u201d \nThrough  sectorwide  program  financing  and  decentralized  implementation  with  increased \nauthority comes the need for increased responsibility for product and proper use of resources. \nEffective  monitoring  will  ensure  objective,  transparent  tracking  and  reporting  of  education \ninvestment activities and will provide the EA with timely information for efficiently planning and \nmanaging  of  primary  education  at  various  levels.  It  also  strengthens  professionalism  and \naccountability of primary education institutions. By strengthening the M&E strategy, PEDP II will \nsupport a mechanism that allows for and guides adjustment and change, gives warning of likely \nfailure or success, and uncovers both weaknesses and strengths.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n44. \nDPE, acting under the overall guidance of MOPME, will be the EA and will integrate the \nPEDP II activities to the extent possible within its regular administrative structure. The EA will be \naccountable  for  making  program  implementation  adhere  to  Government  and  ADB  procedures \nand guidelines,5 as well as for overall transparency and accountability in using PEDP II funds. \nMOPME will establish a program steering committee (PSC) to oversee the work of DPE and the \nprogram  coordination  unit  (PCU),  and  the  implementation  of  PEDP  II.  The  PSC  will  consist  of \nsenior-level  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE),  Economic  Relations Division \n(ERD),  NAPE,  Planning  Commission,  Finance  Division,  DPE,  Implementation  Monitoring  and \nEvaluation  Division,  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts \nAffairs,  Ministry  of  Establishment,  Public  Service  Commission,  Local  Government  Division, \nMinistry of Social Welfare, as well as adequate representation from districts and Upazilas. The \nPSC may co-opt other members as necessary. The secretary MOPME will chair the PSC, and \nthe  director  general  (DG)  of  DPE  will  act as member secretary. The PSC will meet whenever \nnecessary  but,  in  any  case,  not  less  than  once  every  quarter.    It  will  (i)  approve  the  annual \nprogress report, annual operation plans, as well as the supporting budgets; (ii) provide overall \npolicy and operational guidance in implementing the PEDP II and decide on corrective action if \nneeded;  (iii)  undertake  interministerial  coordination  essential  to  achieve  the  reforms  under \nPEDP II; and (iv) resolve issues and conflicts that may emerge during PEDP II implementation. \n \nThe  DG  of  DPE  will  be  the  program  director.  A  PCU  comprising  international  and \n45. \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  established  under  the  DG  to  assist  DPE  in  coordination  of  the \nsupport for the PEDP II from the Government and from the development partners. The PCU will \nbe responsible for the day-to-day coordination of PEDP II, and M&E of progress in implementing \nit  through  line  divisions  of  DPE  with  the  support  of  technical  support  teams  (TSTs)  also \ncomprising international and domestic consultants. More specifically, the PCU will help DPE (i) \nprepare the 3-year program implementation plans; (ii) prepare the annual operational plans; (iii) \ncoordinate  procurement  activities;  (iv)  prepare  and  maintain  financial  records,  accounts,  and \nstatements;  (v)  prepare  all  consolidated  progress  reports,  including  the  midterm  review  report, \nas well as the program completion report; (vi) organize M&E activities; (vii) coordinate the work \nof the TSTs; (viii) liaise on program implementation matters with ADB; and (ix) review the M&E \nreport prepared by the Monitoring and Evaluation Division of DPE for annual review missions. \nThe organization structure for PEDP II at DPE is presented in Appendix 7. Since the structure \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB rules and regulations apply to the administration of the major part of PEDP II external funds (i.e., ADB loan \n  and  grant  funds  under  ADB  administration,  provided  as  joint  cofinancing).  For  parallel  cofinancing  within  the  \n  PEDP II framework, rules and regulations of the parallel financiers apply. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nhas  been  designed  specifically  to  facilitate  transition  from  a  project  approach  to  a  sectorwide \nprogram approach in primary education, the structure will be jointly reviewed and fine-tuned as \nnecessary  in  the  light  of  the  needs  of  the  transition  process.  ADB  will  establish  a  PEDP  II \nLiaison  Unit  (PLU)  within  the  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission  to  exclusively  administer  the \nimplementation of the PEDP II, and  to facilitate close liaison with the EA and its PCU, and the \nPEDP II development partners. ADB will assign adequate staff to the PLU.   \n \n46. \nImplementation  within  each  PEDP  II  component  will  be  under  the  leadership  and \ncoordination  of  DPE  line  directors.  The  TSTs  will  relate  to  each  of  the  main  PEDP  II \ncomponents. It is important that support from TSTs be closely interlinked. Each line director and \nhis/her  staff  will,  with the support of TSTs, manage, guide, direct, facilitate, and supervise the \nspecific  interventions  undertaken  within  the  component.  At  the  regional  level,  divisions  and \ndistricts  will  have  key  supervisory  and  support  roles  in  implementing  PEDP  II.  However, \nincreasingly throughout implementation, functional authority and responsibility will devolve to the \nUpazila and schools. This shift in the locus of control and accountability will help speed up the \ndevelopment  process  and  improve  governance.  Decentralizing the planning and management \nfunctions to the Upazila level will be supported by a strategy of developing and institutionalizing \nan  interactive  bottom-up  process,  articulated  through  the  school  and  Upazila  improvement \nplans,  so  that  the  Upazila  education  office  becomes  the  focal  point  for  primary  education \nplanning  and  management  as  well  as  M&E.  The  organogram  of  primary  education  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n47. \nThe PEDP II will be implemented for 6 years from January 2004 to December 2009. The \nimplementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. A phased transition period, starting from July \n2003  (i.e.  beginning  of  the  government  fiscal  year  2003/2004),  is  being  implemented  by \nMOPME,  DPE  and  development  partners  to  ensure  a  smooth  transition from PEDP I projects \ninto PEDP II as a subsector program.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSubprogram Selection and Processing6 \n\n \n48. \nSupport  to  PEDP  II  is  based  on  a  sector  loan  modality.  Sector  loans  may  finance  the \nsector investment needs in a specified geographic area (area slice) or may support the whole \nsector in the developing member country (DMC) over a specified period (time slice), or both. 7 In \ncase  of  support  to  PEDP  II,  it  is  considered  appropriate  to  designate  each  Annual  Operation \nPlan  (AOP)  as  a  subprogram  (time  slice).  This  is  important  to  enhance  the  PEDP  II  program \napproach and strategies for primary education sector, and to support the Government\u2019s role in \nsectorwide operational planning and implementation. To facilitate PEDP II implementation, the \nGovernment, aided  by  the  PCU,  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  and  PEDP  II  development \npartners 3 months before the start of each fiscal year (by 1 April) an AOP for the coming year. \nThe AOP will meet the following criteria: (i) it is prepared in consultation with and data collected \nfrom stakeholders of PEDP II at various levels of the system; (ii) it includes fully costed activities \nfor each output, linked with performance targets of PEDP II; (iii) it includes details of how PEDP \nII  activities  are  to  be  integrated  into  Government  structure  and  ongoing  activities  at  DPE, \ndivision, district, Upazila, and school levels; (iv) it allocates adequate resources and counterpart \nfunding  in  the  Government  recurrent  budget  for  PEDP  II;  and    (v)  it  is  in  line  with  the  3-year \nimplementation  plan  prepared  for  PEDP  II.  The  AOP  for  the  first  year  will  be  finalized  at \ninception of PEDP II. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6  The  concept  \u201csubprogram\u201d  instead  of  \u201csubproject\u201d  is  used  to  emphasize  the  sectorwide  program  approach  of   \n\nPEDP II (footnote 4).  \n\n7  Sector Lending. Operations Manual, Section 5, para. 3. \n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n49. \nFollowing the Country Procurement Assessment, the Government established a Central \nProcurement  Technical  Unit  under  Implementation,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the \nMinistry  of  Planning.  The  unit's  mandate  is  to  manage  the  public  sector  procurement  reform \nprogram; prepare and issue public procurement regulations; introduce in all public procurement \nstandard bidding documents for goods, works, and professional services; revise the delegation \nof  powers  and  the  procurement  approval  process;  publish  contract  awards;  introduce  appeal \nprocedures and a code of ethics for procurement staff; and establish regular training programs \nto  develop  the  required  human  resources.  The  procurement  reform  has  been  designed  to \nsupport  decentralized  procurement  and  is  highly  relevant  to  the  needs  of  PEDP  II.  The \nimplementation  of  local  procurement  through  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  for  PEDP  II  will \ntake  into  account  the  recommendations  of  the  current  Government  procurement  reform,  and \nfollow  the  new  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003.  Intensive  training  for  undertaking \nprocurement and other capacity-building interventions will be provided in PEDP II for DPE and \nother  levels.  Training  will  be  synchronized  and  coordinated  with  the  training  provided  under \nprocurement  reform.  The  PCU,  working  closely  with  functional  DPE  divisions,  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating procurement under the guidance and supervision of the PSC. Line \ndivisions  of  DPE  and  districts  will  undertake  local  procurement.  Procedures,  manuals,  and \nsystems for monitoring procurement will be established. Before any procurement starts, the EA \nwill submit to ADB for approval a list or lists of the goods to be procured, grouping of the goods, \nand  the  proposed  number  and  scope  of  civil  works  to  be  awarded.  Indicative  procurement \npackages  to  be  financed  under  PEDP  II  are  presented  in  Appendix  9.  Details  of  the \nprocurement reform are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n\na.  Civil Works \n\n \n\n50. \nCivil works will focus on constructing, or rehabilitating, as applicable, 30,000 classrooms \nto  (i)  have  the  capacity  to  accommodate  the  projected  increase  in  enrollment;  (ii) facilitate the \nuse  of  student-centered  and  activity-based  methods  most  suitable  for  young  children  and  for \ndeveloping  basic  competencies;  and  (iii)  increase  the  proportion  of  schools  operating  on  a \nsingle  shift,  with  the  associated  increase  in  contact  hours.  Other  construction  will  provide  for \nincreased capacity and enhanced quality of the teaching and learning environment at PTIs, as \nwell as for greater capacity at the district and Upazila levels. Without exception, the concern in \nproviding  for  civil  works  is  to  support  other  measures  designed  to  improve  quality in system \noperation,  service  delivery,  teacher  performance,  and  student  attainment.  PEDP  II  civil  works \ncontracts  will  not  exceed  $500,000.  They  are  unlikely  to  attract  the  interest  of  international \ncontractors  and  will  therefore  be  awarded  by  LCB  procedures  as  described  in  Public \nProcurement  Regulations  2003,  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  below  the \nstatement of expenditure limit of $100,000 will be permitted only on a case-by-case basis. The \nGovernment  will  submit,  through  the  PCU,  details on the number and scope of civil works for \nADB  approval,  before  withdrawing  for  any  expenditure  for  civil  works.  Efforts  will  be  made  to \nlimit  the  number  of  contracts,  engage  larger  professional  contractors,  and  award  contracts  to \nprequalified  contractors  to  be  managed  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department \n(LGED)  in  accordance  with  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003.  All  construction  will  be \nlocated on land owned by the Government. The Government has assured that no resettlement \nof  people  will  be  involved.  The  Government  has  also  assured  that  all  contractors  will  comply \nwith applicable labor legislation, including that on child labor.  \n \n\nb.  Equipment and Materials \n\n \n51. \nVehicles,  computers  and  accessories,  and  weighing  scales  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) for packages above $500,000 and international shopping \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n(IS)  for  packages  below  $500,000,  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  cofinanced  grant  funds \nadministered by ADB, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. NCTB will procure \nprinting  paper  through  ICB,  with  IDA  financing  in  accordance  with  IDA\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Office  and  school  furniture,  printing  and  binding  of  books,  and  miscellaneous \noffice equipment will be procured through LCB procedures for packages between $100,000 and \na  $500,000,  financed  from  the  common  pool  of  funds  managed  by  the  EA  and  supervised  by \nADB,  in  accordance  with  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003.  To  ensure  economy  and \nefficiency, goods of similar nature will be grouped into packages under one or more bids and the \nPCU  will  coordinate  and  support  DPE  in  undertaking  central  procurement.  Contracts  will  be \nawarded on the basis of a least-cost combination of packages.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n \n52. \nAll international and associated domestic consultants will be financed from the ADB loan \nand  cofinanced  grant  funds  administered  by  ADB,  and  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging domestic consultants. Since the organization structure of the \nPEDP  II  is  expected  to  be  adjusted  during  implementation  due  to  transition  from  a  project \napproach to a sectorwide program approach in primary education, the role of the PCU within the \nstructure  and  the  terms  of  reference  for  PCU  consultants  should  be  adjusted  accordingly.  In \naddition, given the importance of PCU in assisting DPE in coordination of PEDP II and quality \nimprovement of primary education, it is of utmost importance that best consultants available will \nbe selected for the PCU. Therefore, quality-based selection method will be used for selection of \nconsultants  for  the  PCU.  Quality-  and  cost-based selection method will be used for TSTs. For \nsmall  consulting  services  contracts  for  supervision  of  civil  works  and  for  M&E,  domestic \nconsultants will be selected in accordance with Public Procurement Regulations 2003. A total of \nabout  700  person-months  of  international  and  over  1,000  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants will be provided to help implement PEDP II activities through long- and short-term \ncontracts.  With  regard  to  the  number  of  individual  consultants  and  the  number  of  person-\nmonths,  the  aim  is  to  ensure  quality  inputs  while  maintaining  flexibility  and  responsiveness  to \nemerging  needs.  Indicative  contract  packages  of  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \n53. \nGiven the need to have the PCU operating after loan effectiveness, ADB  has approved \nadvance  action  for  recruiting  consultants  for  the  PCU  and  for  procuring  office  equipment  and \nvehicles  for  the  PCU  and  DPE  offices.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  such  advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance the PEDP II. ADB will, as requested by the Government \nand on behalf of the EA, directly shortlist consultancy firms, invite proposals, and evaluate and \nrank them for the PCU consultants (consultancy package A). The EA will negotiate the contract. \n \n\n7.  \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nBased  on  arrangements  in  bilateral  agreements  between  the  grant  cofinanciers  and \n54. \nADB,  the  grant  cofinanciers  will  disburse  their  funds  to  ADB  for  administration  as  jointly \ncofinanced  funds.  For  ADB  loan  funds  and  ADB-administered  jointly  cofinanced  funds,  the \nproceeds  will  be  advanced  to  the  Borrower  and  deposited  in  dollar  imprest  accounts.  For  IDA \nfunds,  the  credit  proceeds  will  be  advanced  to  the  dollar  special  account.  The  dollar  imprest \naccounts  and  the  dollar  special  account  will  be  held  in  a  commercial  bank  nominated  by  the \nFinance Division of the Ministry of Finance, and acceptable to ADB and IDA. The Borrower can \nthen transfer funds from the imprest/special accounts and convert the dollars into the common \npool taka account as needed. To pay contractors, suppliers, and other beneficiaries, the EA will \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\npay with two checks: one from the common pool taka account for the externally financed portion \nand the other from the Government\u2019s Treasury account. \n \n55. \nOn a quarterly basis or earlier, the EA can apply to ADB for liquidation/replenishment of \nthe  imprest/special  accounts.  The  withdrawal  application  must  include  a  statement  of \nexpenditures (SOE). One common SOE format agreed upon by the ADB, joint cofinanciers and \nthe  IDA,  will  be  used  to  harmonize  financial  reporting.  ADB  will  review  the  withdrawal \napplications and will approve eligible expenditures to replenish the imprest accounts. Acting on \nADB\u2019s advice, IDA will transmit the funds requested by the EA. SOE procedures will apply for \nindividual  payments  of  less  than  $100,000.  Operations  of  the  dollar  imprest  and  special \naccounts  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  IDA\u2019s  loan  disbursement  handbooks, \nrespectively, and in accordance with the  Disbursement Procedure Manual. The financing share \nof  each  development  partner  for  PEDP  II  expenditures  will  be  based  on  the  annual  allocation \nagreed  upon  at  the  beginning  of  every  fiscal  year  of  the  Government.  In  addition,  before  a \ncontract is signed, full funding of the contract must be available from the Government and the \ndevelopment  partners.  A  diagram  showing  fund  flows  is  in  Appendix  10.  During  PEDP  II, \nsupport will be provided to improve the capacity of DPE and MOPME in financial management \nand procedures in line with the program approach. Details are in Supplementary Appendix O. \n\n \n\nAccounting, Financial Auditing, and Reporting \n\n8. \n \n56. \nDPE,  assisted  by  the  PCU,  will  maintain  consistent  records,  accounts,  and  related \nfinancial  statements  adequate  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  under  PEDP  II.  DPE, \nassisted by the PCU, will submit quarterly financial reports to ADB according to ADB\u2019s rules and \nregulations. Only one reporting format and system will be maintained for funds in the common \npool, which include funds received from ADB (loan, and grants under ADB administration), and \nfunds  from  IDA.    ADB  will  share  copies  of  the  reports  with  the  development  partners  which \nprovide  grants  under  ADB  administration  (joint  cofinanciers)  and  IDA.  Independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit the PEDP II accounts and related financial statements each year in \naccordance with sound auditing standards. The audited accounts and financial statements and \nthe auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \nThe annual audit report will include the  audit of the imprest and special accounts and SOE, and \na separate audit opinion on their use. Additional financial audits will be undertaken through ADB \nfrom time to time in accordance with agreed upon rules and regulations. \n \n\n9. \n\nProgram Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\na. \n\nKey Performance Indicators \n\n57. \nBased  on  the  PEDP  II  components  and  objectives,  a  set  of  draft  key  performance \nindicators  for  policy,  outcomes,  systems,  and  process  has  been  developed  (Supplementary \nAppendix P). The indicators will be finalized at PEDP II inception.  \n \n\nb.    Baseline Survey \n \n\nEFA indicators that are suitable for the baseline survey and currently available through \n58. \nthe  Education  Management  Information  System  (EMIS)  cell  of  DPE  are  presented  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  Q.  In  addition,  data  established  by  the  ADB-funded Primary School \nPerformance  Monitoring  Project8  will  be  used.  Baseline  indicators  will  be  finalized  at  PEDP  II \ninception. The capacity of DPE to plan and lead the process of further gathering and analyzing \nbaseline  data  and  undertake  M&E  at  all  levels  will  be  strengthened  starting  from  the  PEDP  II \ninception stage. Also the role of communities and SMCs will be emphasized in M&E. \n                                                 \n8 ADB.2002. Technical Assistance for Primary School Performance Monitoring. Manila. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\nc.  External Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n59.  When  weighting  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  arrangements for external M&E \nof PEDP II, it is important to aim for optimum arrangements that ensure enough independence \nand external oversight on one hand, and provision for building local capacity for external M&E \non the other hand. The best option is to undertake  external M&E under the management of the \nPEDP II Liaison Unit (PLU) to be established under ADB. The PLU will outsource external M&E \nservices,  such  as  studies,  formative  research  on  the  PEDP  II  implementation  process,  and \nperformance audits, as required, from local institutions and the private sector, including NGOs \nwhere  appropriate.  In  addition,  Implementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the \nMinistry of Planning will undertake, according to its standard mandate, external M&E. Feedback \nfrom beneficiaries, including parents and pupils, will provide important data for external M&E. \n \n\nd.  Program Performance Management System \n\n \n60. \nA comprehensive performance management system will be established for PEDP II. The \nPEDP  II  common  framework,  the  comprehensive  set  of  verifiable  indicators,  and  the \ncoordinated and integrated M&E procedures and systems to be established by DPE Monitoring \nand Evaluation Division together with DPE line directors will ensure comprehensive and timely \nprogress  reporting.  DPE,  supported  by  the  PCU,  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly \nprogress reports on PEDP II implementation, within 3 weeks after the end of each quarter, with \ncopies to PEDP II development partners. The progress report will follow a format agreed upon \nat PEDP II inception.   \n \nThe  progress  reports  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against \n61. \nestablished targets; (ii) problems encountered during the period and remedial actions taken or \nproposed  to  resolve  the  problems;  (iii)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv) proposed \nimplementation activities to be undertaken and physical and financial progress expected during \nthe succeeding quarter, including detailed contract awards and disbursement projections. DPE \nwill  prepare  a  program  completion  report  and  submit  it  to  ADB  and  the  development  partners \nnot later than 3 months after physical completion of the PEDP II. The report will analyze overall \nprogress, achievement of outputs, compliance with the loan covenants, and will include costs. \n \n62. \nThe  performance  management  system  will  determine  whether  the  inputs  delivered  for \nimplementing  the  PEDP  II  activities  have  yielded  the  expected  outputs  and  benefits  to  the \nintended  beneficiaries.  Gender  segregated  data  will  be  used.  The  performance  management \nsystem will include also public expenditure tracking. It will seek to detect any deficiency in and \ndiscrepancy  between  the  operational  plan  and  execution  in  using  the  resources  efficiently,  so \nthat  timely  corrections  can  be  made  to  update  the  plans  to  improve  benefits,  outcomes, and \nimpact. Information from progress reports, annual reviews, the midterm review (MTR), and from \nexternal M&E studies will be also utilized. Impact M&E will provide valuable qualitative data to \nsupport improvement of PEDP II during its lifetime. \n \n\n10. \n\nProgram Review \n\na.  Annual Reviews and Thematic Reviews \n\n63. \nThe  Government,  ADB,  and  development  partners  will  jointly  review  the  PEDP  II \nannually. AOPs will be the main focus of annual reviews undertaken jointly by the Government \nand development partners. The jointly agreed-upon AOP will be the basis for implementing and \nfinancing PEDP II in each fiscal year. The annual review will determine compliance with specific \nloan covenants and whether all required inputs and support functions on the Government side \nare in place. The review will also evaluate the effectiveness of implementation mechanisms and \nthe  efficiency  of  the  organizational  development  and  capacity  building  for  the  program \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\napproach,  and  may  result  in  a  decision  to  continue  them  or  to  adjust  them.  Joint reviews will \nspecifically  (i)  analyze  the  results  of  the  previous  year,  (ii)  identify  adjustments  needed, \n(iii) assess the impact of the program on poverty reduction, (iv) assess program contributions to \nthe  improvement  of  the  quality  of  primary  education, (v) assess implementation performance \nagainst agreed-upon indicators in the program framework and adjust indicators as needed, (vi) \nidentify primary education policy issues, and (vii) identify constraints to program implementation. \nSpecial attention will be given to (i) the effectiveness of program strategies for promoting greater \nparticipation  of  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups;  (ii)  progress  on  key  program  innovations,  and \nassessing  learning  outcomes  and  quality  of  teaching;  and  (iii) coordination  of  interventions \nwithin the program, and integration of program activities in the government structure. In addition \nto AOPs, a detailed 3-year implementation plan (up to the MTR) will be prepared at inception, to \nreflect the Government\u2019s 3-year rolling plan cycle, and will be updated on the basis of an annual \nplanning cycle. Draft versions of the first year AOP, and the 3-year implementation schedule are \npresented in Supplementary Appendixes R and S. \n \n64. \nTo promote achievement of the key outcomes of PEDP II, up to 25% of the pooled funds \nwill  be  released  on  the  basis  of  performance,  as  measured  by  milestones  that  will  combine \nprocess,  system  and  policy  outcome  indicators,  as  reflected  in  the  PEDP  II  policy  matrix  and \nkey performance indicators. With at least 75% of pool funds representing predictable financing, \nfunding  of  key  school  level  objectives  of  the  program  will  be  protected.  The  aim  is  to  provide \nincentives for achieving benchmarks in the reforms, and for ensuring that during implementation \nand  annual  reviews  adequate  and  consistent  attention  will  be  given  to  policy  and  institutional \nreforms  which  are  necessary  for  achieving  sustainable  improvement  in  quality  of  primary \neducation. Performance-based financing triggers and allocations will be decided during  the joint \nannual reviews, taking into consideration progress in reforms during the AOP under review, and \nthe  AOP  prepared  for  the  following  year.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  PEDP  II  development \npartners will document their agreement on these issues in the review reports. In addition to the \njoint annual reviews, shorter thematic reviews will be held once a year. \n\nb.  Midterm Review  \n\n65. \nThe Government, ADB, and other development partners will jointly undertake a MTR at \nthe end of year 3 of PEDP II implementation to assess progress in meeting the long-term vision \nfor primary education in Bangladesh, as presented in the Government\u2019s action plan.  The MTR \nwill  evaluate  (i)  PEDP  II  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  institutional \nchanges; (ii) implementation  progress  against  agreed  upon  indicators  in  the  AOPs  and  the  3 \nyears  implementation  plan;  (iii)  procurement  performance;  (iv)  PCU  effectiveness;  (v) \nperformance of consultants; (vi) fund flows and arrangements; (vii) the geographic coverage of \nUpazila  Primary  Education  Plans  (UPEPs)  and  SLIPs  and  their  operation;  (viii)  progress  in \nimplementing the gender action plan, the vulnerable groups action plan, and the action plan for \nindigenous peoples; (ix) lessons learned; any (x) other issues agreed upon by the Government, \nADB,  and  other  development  partners.  No  later  than  one  month  before  the  MTR,  DPE  will \nsubmit to ADB a comprehensive report covering the above issues. Feedback from civil society \non PEDP II implementation will also be sought during MTR. The MTR will recommend changes \nin program design and implementation arrangements, as necessary.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits \n\n66. \nThe  PEDP  II  design  focuses  on  quality  improvements  that  will  establish  the  necessary \nfoundation  for  a  more  efficient  and  effective  primary  education  system.  The  investment  will \npromote quality improvements in education, the beneficiaries of which will be the new students \nentering  the  education  system  as  well  as  those  who  are  already  in  the  primary  education \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nfor \n\nteaching  and \n\nstream.  Quality  improvements  will  include  a  reduced  pupil-teacher  ratio,  an  increase  in  the \nnumber  of  textbooks  and  supplemental  materials,  better  physical  facilities,  and  an  increase  in \nthe  number  of  pupil-teacher  contact  hours \nlearning  activities.  Key \nimprovements  that  will  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  better  quality  primary \neducation  include  the  development  of  high  quality  initial  and  in-service  training  programs  for \nteachers  and  head  teachers.  The  training  programs  will  ensure  greater  use  of  classroom \npractices that are appropriate for teaching and learning basic competencies, especially literacy \nand numeracy, and other foundation concepts that underpin learning in everyday life, and later \nin  secondary  and  higher  education.  Providing  the  necessary  additional  teaching  and  learning \nresources  will  ensure  that  every  school  has  the  basic  tools  and  aids  to  support  the  new \nmethodologies.  However,  none  of  these  improvements  will  be  sustainable  without  enhanced \nsystem capacity and efficiency. The long-term crosscutting benefits of the comprehensive sector \napproach  adopted  will  be  improved  organizational  and  institutional  development,  and  human \nresource  development  strategies,  and  the  provision  of  additional  financial  and  other  resources \nthat  will  ensure  greater  long-term  sustainability  of  primary  education  services,  both  technically \nand financially. Ensuring that these improvements reach beyond the urban areas to the furthest \nregions  of  Bangladesh  will  help  overcome  the  barriers  caused  by  remoteness and geography. \nAnother crosscutting benefit of the sector approach adopted will be the rapid reduction of stand-\nalone project implementation units, which currently tend to remove key education staff from their \nregular  positions,  result  in  off-budget  resource  management,  and  distort  staff  performance \nreward  and  incentives  systems.  The  program  approach  of  the  PEDP  II  includes  harmonized \nrequirements  and  procedures  of  development  partners  for  financial  management,  progress \nreporting,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  local  procurement,  and  review  missions.  Hence,  the \napproach will reduce transaction costs of the Government and development partners, improve \ncoordination  between  all  parties,  and  strengthen  the  participation  of  MOPME,  DPE,  and \nstakeholders in other levels in primary education annual planning. This approach will therefore \nincrease  organizational  and  financial  efficiency  for  enhancing  the  quality  of  and  access  to \nprimary education in a holistic and balanced manner. \n\nfemale \n\nteachers;  (vii) \n\n \n67. \nA balanced, holistic focus is necessary since the past 15 years has seen rapid growth in \nenrollment ratios, and strong overall quantitative growth in primary education as a whole. PEDP \nII will promote a balanced development focus by providing resources particularly for improving \nthe  quality  of  primary  education  and  access  to  it,  by:  (i)  increasing  the  completion  rate;    (ii) \nimproving the enrollment ratio for girls and children from poor families; (iii) addressing the needs \nof the disadvantaged, indigenous, and refugee children, and design specific targeted strategies \nfor  equitable  enrollment,  completion,  and  attainment;    (iv)  improving  the  quality  of  teacher \ntraining at the PTIs, subcluster level, and in URCs increasing facilities for head teacher training; \n(v)  increasing  training  opportunities  for  teachers  from  the  RNGPS;  (vi)  recruiting  of  teachers, \nespecially \nfor  classroom \nperformance and achievement; (viii) strengthening field-level monitoring; (ix) providing adequate \ninfrastructure, sanitation, and water facilities for schools; (x) improving delivery of textbooks and \nadequate learning materials;  (xi) strengthening the resource base of URCs, where emphasis is \non  Masters  degrees  or  Bachelor  degrees  in  education  and  teaching  experience for instructors \nand AEOs; (xii) strengthening social mobilization and social development activities to increase \nenrollment  and  retention  ratio  for  children  from  poor  households;  (xiii)  restructuring  and \nstrengthening  SMCs  and  Parent  Teacher  Associations  (PTAs)  for  their  active  participation  in \nschool  management  and  planning;  (xiv)  increasing  accountability  of  the  school  system  to \nparents  and  the  community;  (xv)  establishing  education  committees  at  the  local  government \nlevel (Union Parishad and Upazila level).   \n \n68. \nThe  noted  measures,  particularly  (ii),  (iii),  and  (xii),  will  improve  access  to  primary \neducation by the poor, disadvantaged, and indigenous people, and will therefore enhance their \n\ninstruments  and  methods \n\nintroducing \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\nbasic  competencies  and  chances  for  secondary  school  education/vocational  training  and \nemployment  opportunities.  While  Bangladesh  is  a  largely  monoculture  society,  there  is  an \nindigenous  people  population  living  largely  in  CHT  and  in  parts  of  Sylhet  and  in  northern \nBangladesh.  Priority  in  access  to  education  will  be  given  to  remote  areas;  underserved, \nunderschooled  areas  of  CHT;  and  districts  with  indigenous  people.  Poor  children  are  often \nforced  to  work  as  child  laborers  in  hazardous  and  exploitative  forms  of  employment.  With \nsupport from PEDP II, these children will  be provided with opportunity for primary education. In \naddition,  the  targeting  of  poor  children  will  also  be  addressed  through  the  Government\u2019s \nextensive  stipend  program,  which  has  been  designed  to  benefit  poor  children  in  particular.  A \npoverty  impact  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  (i)  the  degree  to  which  the  existing \nProgram  (PEDP  I)  targets  poverty  and  achieves  poverty  impact;  and  (ii)  the  degree  to  which \nPEDP  II  is  expected  to  improve  poverty  targeting  and  the  additional  poverty  impact  that  is \nexpected from its implementation. By the end of PEDP II, enrolment of poor children is expected \nto  increase  by  2.7  million  to  3.2  million,  and  67\u201376%  of  total  PEDP  II  expenditure  (compared \nwith  55%  in  FY2001/02)  is  expected  to  have  been  targeted  to  the  poor.  Details of the poverty \nimpact analysis are in Appendix 11.  \n \n69. \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  gender  parity  in  enrollment;  PEDP  II  will  now \nemphasize  improving  completion  rates,  which  are  low  for  both  boys  and  girls.  To  ensure \nprogress  in  meeting  the  government  quota  of  60%  female  teachers,  the  proportion  of  female \nteachers is planned to reach 50% during PEDP II from the current proportion of 38%. Gender \nequality training will be included in the subcluster and PTI training. To enhance gender equality \nin planning and implementing of PEDP II, linkages will be made with the Ministry of Women and \nChildren Affairs at national and local levels.  \n \n70. \nOverall, the estimated immediate beneficiaries of PEDP II are (i) about 16 million pupils \nin  about  65,000  primary  schools  under  the  MOPME  (ii)  35,000  new  primary  school  teachers \nwho will receive initial training and (iii) all 40,000 existing untrained primary school teachers who \nwill receive initial training. In addition, the target group of in-service training includes all 320,000 \nexisting trained primary school teachers and head teachers, including primary school teachers \nin schools under MOE administration, who will receive in-service training through several stages \nduring PEDP II. Over 17 million pupils in about 78,000 primary schools will benefit from the in-\nservice training of their teachers. \n\n \n\nB. \n\nRisk Analysis \n\nThe design and implementation plan of PEDP II draw heavily from lessons learned from \n71. \nprevious  interventions  in  primary  education  in  Bangladesh,  and  also  more  widely  from \nexperiences from implementing sectorwide approach modality in Bangladesh and the region. To \navoid  the  risks  and  problems  associated  with  coordination  and  implementation  of  numerous \nseparate  project  interventions,  and  the  consequent  lack  of  impact  of  such  interventions  on \nquality improvement, PEDP II has been designed to have a holistic focus\u2014acknowledging that \nimproved  quality  at  the  classroom  level  cannot  be  achieved  without  improvement  at  the \nsystemic  level.  Implementing  a  sectorwide  program  approach  as  in  PEDP  II  also  entails \nsignificant  risks.  The  risks  have  been  analyzed,  and  a  detailed  risk  mitigation  plan  has  been \ndeveloped.  Organizational  development,  institutional  reform,  and  capacity  building  will  be \nsupported  for  efficient  implementation  of  the  program  approach,  based  on  a  comprehensive \npolicy and institutional reform matrix agreed to by all parties for PEDP II. While the Government \nis committed to a sectorwide program approach, there is a risk that a future Government could \nreverse policy decision on this commitment. However, this risk is not considered high, since the \nsectorwide  approach  and  program  modalities  are  very  much  linked  with  wider  long-term \ndevelopment  frameworks  of  Bangladesh,  such  as  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy,  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\nthe MTEF. These have been agreed upon at high international forums and are being monitored \nregularly through an international consultative process. \n\n \n72. \nThere is also a risk that the Government may not be able to allocate adequate financial \nresources  for  the  Program.  Therefore,  as  part  of  the  risk  analysis  and  preparation  of  the \nfinancial plan, financial sustainability was assessed by (i) reviewing the general adequacy of the \nrevenue expenditure budget allocation to support the recurrent cost of delivering public primary \neducation  services,  and  (ii)  analyzing  the  recurring  cost  implications  of  PEDP  II  investments. \nThe cost of the Government\u2019s stipend program is included as a recurring cost, given its policy \nimplications and its recurring nature. Two scenarios have been developed to determine the level \nof revenue expenditure budget that will be required to support primary education after PEDP II \n\u2014a  base  case  scenario  and  a  high-growth  scenario.    Based  on  broad  assumptions,  it  is \nestimated  that  an  increase  of  83%  in  the  FY2002/03  revenue  expenditure  budget  will  be \nrequired  by  FY2008/09  to  adequately  cover  the  recurring  costs  of  existing  public  primary \neducation programs and the recurring cost implications of PEDP II investments. Compared with \nthe  existing  level  of  recurrent  expenditures  paid  from  the  revenue  expenditure  budget  and  the \ndevelopment budget, i.e., as incurred in FY2002/03 (according to Government estimates), this \nrepresents  a  real  increase  of  only  6%.  Therefore,  while  apparently  substantial,  this  increase \ncould be phased in by the end of PEDP II, primarily through a shift from the development budget \nto the revenue expenditure budget. Details of the analysis are in Supplementary Appendix T. \n \n73. \nAlso,  the  possibility  of  corruption  and  financial  mismanagement  has  been  addressed. \nThe  approved  PEDP  II  policy  and  institutional  reform  framework  include  measures  to  ensure \nbetter  governance,  efficiency \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  procurement.  Public  expenditure  tracking  surveys  will  be  undertaken.  An \naction  plan  for  addressing  the  financial  irregularities  in  the  sub-sector  will  be  implemented.   \nProgram\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed,  and  no  significant  adverse  impacts  were \nidentified.  However,  environmental  considerations  will  be  incorporated  to  avoid  significant \nenvironmental impacts, such as those from water contaminated with arsenic, sanitation facilities, \nand construction of classrooms.  \n \n74. \nAn  overall  risk  management  strategy  matrix  for  PEDP  II  has  been  prepared,  where \ncritical sector policy issues are identified and prioritized. For each critical sector policy issue, a \nstrategy and action plan was prepared for actions to be completed before implementation and \nactions to be implemented as an integral part of PEDP II. The matrix will be updated as required \nand used during joint reviews or dialogues between the Government and development partners. \nThe matrix is presented in Supplementary Appendix U. \n \n\nin  system  performance,  and \n\ntransparency \n\nin \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances, the Government has the following assurances, \n\n75. \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nWithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  prepared  a \ndevolution  plan  for  gradually  decentralizing  planning  and  management  of \neducation  activities  to  the  districts,  Upazilas,  and  schools;  by  MTR  all  action \nneeded to make such devolution operational will be finalized. \n\n(ii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  DPE  will  have  established  a  full-fledged \nfinancial management unit and finalized a financial management manual; \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\n(iii)  Within 9 months of loan effectiveness, MOPME will have prepared a time-bound \naction  plan  to  address  fiscal  and  supervisory  irregularities  in  the  primary \n \n \neducation sector. \n(iv)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, DPE will establish a task force to monitor \nprimary  school  quality  levels;  by  June  2004,  common  learning  outcome \nstandards for school performance will have been formulated. \n\n(v)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  finalized  and \napproved  an  action  plan  for  establishing  a  primary  education  cadre,  to  be  fully \nimplemented by 31 December 2005.  \n\n(vi)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  all  vacancies  for  DPEOs,  ADPEOs,  UEOs, \nAUEOs and URCs will be filled; and, by MTR, all professional positions in DPE, \nNAPE, and NCTB. \n\n(vii)  At the latest by 31 December 2004, DPE will have prepared the first phase of the \nhuman  resources  development  and  management  strategy  and  plan  for  primary \neducation  including  measures  to  increase  recruitment  of  female  teachers  and \ntraining  opportunities  for  female  staff.

These constraints summarize the major issues and challenges that face \nBangladesh  as  it  seeks  to  meet  the  Education  for  All  (EFA)  agenda  by  2015.  The  following \ndiscussion examines these issues, focusing on the challenges facing the Government over the \nnext 5\u201315 years.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nBangladesh,  like  many  developing  countries,  has  made  considerable  progress  in \nensuring that all children have access to primary education through the formal system. Indeed, \nthe  data  suggest  that  more  than  90%  of  children  do  attend primary school for some period of \ntime, although the percentage actually completing all primary grades is much lower  - probably \nclose to 50% - although the official data indicate 67% completion. Completion, like participation, \nis  linked  to  cost  and  poverty,  but  it  is,  at  least  in  part  and  increasingly  as  systems  and \neconomies  develop,  linked  to  the  perceived  quality  of  the  education  that  children  receive. \nParents  faced  with  serious  poverty  constraints  do  not  wish  to  use  scarce  resources  on  an \nineffective education that cannot deliver appropriate rewards to the next generation. \n \n3. \nMany  factors  contribute  to  this  real  and  perceived  lack  of  quality.  These  include  the \nemployment  of  untrained  teachers,  the  shift  or  staggered  system  with  its  comparatively short \nschool contact hours, lack of support materials for teacher and student use (especially the lack \nof  supplementary  reading  materials),  lack  of  motivated  teachers,  a  poor  physical  environment \nfor learning, etc. There is compelling evidence1 to support these perceptions.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nAt  least  20,000  teachers  in  government  primary  schools  (about  16%)  were \nuntrained  as  of  November  2002,  while  the  majority  of  those  who  have  a \nCertificate in Education (C. in Ed.) are, at best, poorly trained. The situation in the \nsatellite, registered nongovernment primary schools (RNGPS) and other schools \nwithin the formal sector is even worse. \n \nThere is a general lack of teaching and learning materials except  textbooks and \nchalkboards.  As  a  result,  the  resource  environment  in  which  teachers  and \nstudents  teach  and  learn  is  impoverished,  reinforcing  a  reliance  on  memory- \noriented  learning  in  classes  dominated  by  teacher-directed activity, instead of a \nshift toward student-centered and activity-based methods that would support the \ncompetency-based curriculum. \n\nTeachers  are  poorly  paid  and  go  unrewarded  for  the  attainment  of  higher \nqualifications  and  increased  responsibility,  and,  as  a  result,  lack  motivation  to \nimprove.  This  low  level  of  motivation  reveals  itself  in  lack  of  punctuality and a \nhigh level of absenteeism. \n\nBy  international  standards  the  official  school  attendance  hours  are  much  lower \nthan  necessary  for  effective  learning  (Table  A2).  But  evidence  derived  through \nmonitoring studies suggests that the official figures are well in excess of the real \n\n                                                 \n1  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  data  are  from  official  education  management  information  system  (EMIS)  supplied \n \n\nthrough the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE). \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nCountry \nAustralia \nBangladesh \nBelgium \nCanada \nEgypt \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nSri Lanka \nVietnam \n\nsituation.  Teacher  and  student  absenteeism  and  laxity  in  school  management \nmean  that  actual  contact  hours  are  probably  at  least  30%  below  the  levels \nsuggested by official statistics. \n\nTable A2: Primary Education Cycle: Length of Studies and \n    Total Class Hours for Selected Countries \n\nYears of \nPrimary \nEducation \n6 \n5 \n6 \n6 \n5 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n5 \n5 \n5.9 \n\nAverage Class \nHours Per \nYear \n1,000 \n768 \n850 \n1,000 \n908 \n875 \n933 \n1,144 \n906 \n874 \n840 \n910 \n\nTotal \nClass \nHours \n6,000 \n3,840 \n5,096 \n6,000 \n4,539 \n5,244 \n5,597 \n6,865 \n5,434 \n4,370 \n4,200 \n5,367 \n\nInternational Average (67 Countries) \n\nSource:  Second Primary Education Development Program (PEDP II) Macro Plan. January 2003. Dhaka \n\n \n \n4. \nThe impact of these highly negative factors is clearly shown in the low completion rates \nand  even  more  so  in  the  extremely  low  pass  rate  (5%)  in  the  annual  grade  5  scholarship \nexaminations. Qualitative reports and other research2 suggest that many children\u2014perhaps the \nmajority and even those \u201csuccessfully\u201d completing class 5\u2014do not attain acceptable standards \nof literacy and numeracy, and many lapse into illiteracy once they leave school.  \n \n5. \nAdded to these  factors  that  impact  directly  on  the  child  at  school,  are  other  forces  that \nwork against quality improvement on a national scale. These latter forces include the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsocioeconomic  environment  that  favors  the  more  economically  well-off  urban \nclasses  and  disadvantages  the  poor  and  those  handicapped  through  physical \nand intellectual impairments; \ndiversity  of  schooling  within  the  formal  sector,  making  it  more  difficult  to  adopt \nand  institutionalize  better  classroom  practices  across  the  whole  primary  school \nspectrum; \ncompetition  from  the  nonformal  sector  that  supports,  albeit  inadvertently,  the \ndecisions  of  parents  to  take  their  children  away  from  the  formal  sector  and  put \nthem into employment in the knowledge that their children will be able to achieve \nliteracy and numeracy and graduate at primary level at a nonformal center run by \none or other nongovernment organization; and \ngenerally  weak  organizational  and  institutional  framework  and  structure  for \ndelivery of primary education. \n\nSo, while the challenge to improve the quality of primary education is great in itself, the \n\n \n6. \nchallenge to overcome the other contributing negative forces is equally so.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  For example: Literacy Profiles of Primary School Children in Bangladesh \u2013 Draft Report.

With  at  least  40%  of  the \npopulation on or below the established poverty line with household income no greater than $1 \nper  day,  and  perhaps  another  30%  living  on  no  more  than  $2  per  day,  the  Government  has \nmoved  to  provide  substantial  income  support  through  the  Primary  Education  Stipend  Program \n(supplementary appendix F) within the PEDP II framework. With payments based on attendance \nand  satisfactory  performance,  it  can  be  expected  that  this  program  will  strongly  encourage \ngreater  numbers  of  children  from  the  poorest  families  to  attend  and  complete  school.  The \nselection  criteria  initially  targeted  the  poorest  40%  of  the  enrolled  students  in  rural  primary \nschools. Since then the coverage has been extended to also cover urban schools. \n  \n8. \nOther  disadvantaged  groups  underrepresented  in  primary  schooling  include  the  urban \nslum  dwellers  (particularly  squatters),  the  geographically  isolated  communities,  disabled \nchildren, and child workers. Contemporary studies also show that tribal children in Bangladesh \ncontinue to experience higher incidences of poverty, illiteracy, dropout rates, and disease than \nthe national averages. These are partly the result of years of conflict, but they also represent the \nresult  of  ongoing  ethnic  discrimination  that  places  insufficient  value  on  tribal  languages  and \ntraditions in learning.  \n \n9. \nClearly, in the context of the Government\u2019s goal of EFA and  the specific PEDP II goals, \nthe  challenge  of  providing  an  \u201cinclusive  education\u201d  that  pays  more  than  lipservice  to  the  \u201call\u201d \naspect  of  EFA  is  very  important.  Full  mainstreaming  of  all  primary  education  age  children  into \nformal primary education cannot be expected or demanded within the next 5 years. But changes \nthat  can  lead  to  full  mainstreaming  in  the  future  need  to  be  started  as  soon  as  possible.  To \nimprove quality without meeting the challenge of ensuring that \u201call\u201d children are included within \nthe  ambit  of  formal  primary  education  will  reduce  the  impact  of  universal  primary  education  in \nhelping  to  eliminate  the  socioeconomic  divisions  and  disparities  within  the  population,  and  will \nundermine the Government\u2019s credibility on a most serious social issue.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nAs  in  many,  if  not  all  developing  countries,  most  of  the  problems  confronting  primary \neducational  improvement  are  created  and  magnified  by  organizational  and  institutional \nweaknesses.  In  part,  these  weaknesses  are  the  result  of  the  rapid  growth  of  the  educational \nsystem while the organizational and institutional framework of structures, rules, and processes \nchange far more slowly. In part, they are the result of weak planning, vested interest inertia, and \nactive opposition to change. \n \ntraditional  centralized  bureaucracy  based  on  a  well-educated \n11. \nadministrative  cadre  that  has  no  specific  expertise  in  primary  education  is  a  major  handicap \nwhen  channeling  resources  to  areas  and  activities  that  have  not  been  traditionally  supported. \nThe lack of supplementary teaching and learning materials, and the focus on traditional teaching \nmethods  more  suited  to  past  curricula  are  examples  of  how  difficult  it  is  to  convince  policy \nmakers  and  system  bureaucrats  to  promote  and  fund  such  \u201cinnovations.\u201d  The  tendency  for \nadministrators  and  bureaucrats  to  regard  primary  education  as  of  lesser  importance  and \ndemanding  less  skill  and  lower  qualifications  than  secondary  and  postsecondary  education, \ndespite  the  political  rhetoric  to  the  contrary,  adds  to  this  indisposition  to  change  and \nimprovement. At a time when pressure on scarce financial resources is ever increasing primary \n\nThe Systemic Challenge \n\nSpecifically, \n\nthe \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 2 \n\neducation loses because no people at the upper echelons are willing to promote its cause and \nneeds. \n \n12. \nEven within the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) there is lack of primary teaching \nexpertise  within  a  structure  that  has  left  some  important  functions  such  as  finance  and \nprocurement  and  Education  Management \nInformation  Systems  (EMIS)  without  proper \norganizational homes and nearly all functions are in the hands of people who lack the essential \nskills  to  meet  the  demands  of  their  posts.  The  slow  development  of  effective  EMIS  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  functions  means  absence  of  base  data  on  which  to  pin  effective \ndecision making. This makes overall systemic change slow and difficult.  \n \n13. \nThe  education  offices  at  division,  district  and  Upazila  levels  are  also  suffering  through   \nlack  of  human  and  financial  resources.  At  a  time  when  the  Government  is  promoting  the \nstrategy  of  decentralization  and  devolution,  the  lack  of  resources  at  those  levels  is  a  serious \nomission  and  contradiction.  Without  the  resources  to  implement,  and  with  final  authority  for \ndecision making clearly centered in Dhaka, the opportunity for regional offices to develop local \nsolutions to local problems is extremely limited.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nstrategies include the following: \n \n\nThe PEDP II recognizes these challenges and provides strategies to meet them. These \n\nMeeting the Challenges \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nadoption  of  a  \u201cquality  standards\u201d  approach  that  will  guarantee  every  primary \nschool a basic level and quality of inputs irrespective of location; \ncoordinated,  integrated  and  comprehensive  subsector  strategy  that  creates  the \nbasis  for  quality  improvement  at  all  levels  and  in  all  aspects  of  the  primary \neducation  sector.  Organizational  capacity  building,  quality  improvement  in \nteaching  and  learning,  improved  infrastructure  and  facilities,  and  inclusive \neducation are all supported by the PEDP II. The synergies between elements are \nused to create strength and improvement in all; \ncapacity development through improved recruitment and training for all personnel \nwhether administrators or teachers; and  \ndecentralization  and  devolution  of  appropriate  authority,  responsibility  and \ndecision  making  to  Upazila,  school,  and  community  levels,  to  promote  faster \nresponse and local solutions to problems and issues. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nProject Title \nand Period \nPrimary Education \nDevelopment \nProgram (PEDP I) \n \n1998/99 \u2013 2002/03 \n(5 years) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLESSONS LEARNED AND EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PRIMARY EDUCATION  \n\nSource of \nFunding \n\nAmount \n($) \n\nProgram/Project \nObjectives \n\nMajor Lessons Learned \n\nGovt.: \n2.011 \nbillion \n \nAid \nAgencies: \n752 million \n\nAsian \nDevelopment \nBank (ADB), \nIslamic \nDevelopment \nBank (IDB), \nInternational \nDevelopment \nAssociation \n(IDA), \nDepartment for \nInternational \nDevelopment \n(DFID), \nGovernment of \nGermany, \nNorwegian \nAgency for \nDevelopment \nCooperation \n(NORAD), \nUnited Nations\u2019 \nChildren Fund \n(UNICEF), \nUnited States \nAgency for \nInternational \nDevelopment \n(USAID) \n \n \n\n95% enrollment \nreached by 2001 \n\nPrimary completion \nrate to 70% by 2001 \n\nExtend classroom \ncontact time by \neliminating the \nstaggered system. \n\nImprove curriculum, \nlearning materials, \nand teaching aids. \n\nImprove quality of \nteachers through \neffective teacher \ntraining. \n\nImprove school \nmanagement and \nacademic \nsupervision. \n\nStrengthen primary \neducation \ninfrastructure by \nimproving \nmanagement \ninformation system \n(MIS), planning, and \nimplementation. \n\nMonitor inputs and \nprocess and evaluate \noutputs. \n\n \n\nDevelop a national \nresearch and \ndevelopment \ncapacity. \n\nProvide adequate \nphysical facilities  \n\nQuality improvement in Bangladesh \nschools will take a coordinated \ncombination of interventions over time.

Yes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in             Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis? \n \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in developing member country (DMC):  \nBangladesh is a signatory to the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) 1990, which adopted the World \nDeclaration on Education for All (EFA) by the year 2000 and agreed on the basic Framework for Action to Meet \nBasic Learning Needs. Bangladesh has shown a strong national commitment to education and has one of the \nlargest  primary  education  systems  in  the  world.  In  the  Government\u2019s poverty reduction statement, three broad \ndimensions of human poverty\u2014deprivation in health, education, and nutrition\u2014are used as indicators for poverty. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  recognizes  primary  school  education  as  a  key  area  for  investment  and \ndevelopment  as  a  means  for  reducing  poverty  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  for  children  in  Bangladesh.  The \npast  15  years  have  seen  rapid  growth  in  participation  and  completion  rates  and  strong  overall  growth  in  the \nsystem  of  primary  education  as  a  whole.  Progress  has  been  made  in  improving  school  facilities,  training  and \ncurriculum  revision,  and  provision  of  textbooks.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  gender  parity  in \nenrollment. The 2001 school year data show that 17.7 million students were enrolled in over 78,000 primary level \ninstitutions,  taught  by  more  than  320,000  teachers.  This  number  represented  a  30.8%  increase  over  the \nenrollment level in 1991. The gross enrollment ratio (GER) reached 97.5% in 2001 and may be slightly higher \nthan that level for girls. However, preliminary data for 2002 suggests that enrollment has declined by 1.5% from \n2001. The net enrollment ratio (NER) is closer to 75%.  \n\nThe  experience  of  the  first  Primary  Education  Development  Program  (PEDP  I)  is  not  just  one  of  success.  The \nfindings of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Primary School Performance Monitoring Project (PSPMP), \nassessment  of  first  Primary  Education  Development  Program  (PEDP  I)  and  field  observations  indicate  the \nfollowing:  (i)  Higher  rate  of  dropouts,  averaging  33%,  results  partly  from  poverty  of  many  families;  (ii)  Rate  of \nattendance  of  students  (61%)  is  low;  (iii)  Primary  school  completion  rate  is  estimated  at  67%  indicating  many \nchildren do not receive full primary education; (iv) Children from poor working class, tribal, refugee, and disabled \nchildren are marginalized in the formal education system; (v) Pupil-to-teacher ratio, which is about 55:1, is high; \n(vi) The number of contact hours between students and teachers is low, absenteeism is high and teachers come \nlate  to  work;  (vii)  There  is  lack  of  quality  teacher\u2019s  training  at  the  primary  education  teacher  training  institutes \n(PTIs)  and  subcluster  level;  (viii)  Teachers  from  nonregistered  and  other  categories  of  school  receive  little \ntraining;  (ix)  There are fewer female than male teachers in government primary schools (42%) and even fewer \n(26%)  in  registered  nongovernment  primary  school  (RNGPS);  (x)  Field-level  monitoring  is  limited  to  easily \naccessible schools and a weak monitoring system; (xi) Textbooks are not available on time and teaching aids are \ninsufficient; (xii) Classrooms are scarce and  toilet facilities inadequate; and (xiii) School management committee \n(SMC) and parent and teachers\u2019 association (PTA) are dysfunctional. \n\nIn the design of Second Primary Education Development Program (PEDP II) emphasis is on improving the quality \nof  education  and  access  to  education  for  the  government  primary  school  (GPS),  RNGPS,  and  community \nschools.  The  PEDP  II  will  focus  on  (i)  increasing  the  completion  rate  of  primary  education;  (ii)  retaining  the \nenrollment rate for children from the poor families and girls, (ii) addressing the needs of the disadvantaged, tribal, \nand  refugee  children,  and  design  specific  targeted  strategies  for  equitable  enrollment,  completion,  and \nattainment; (iii) improving the quality of teachers\u2019 training at the PTI and subcluster level, increasing facilities for \nhead teacher training; (iv) increasing training opportunities for teachers from RNGPS; (v) recruiting of teachers, \nespecially  female  teachers;  (vi)  integrating  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  PSPMP  for  quality;  (vii)  introducing \ninstruments  and  methods  developed  by  PSPMP  for  assessing  baseline  classroom  performance  and \nachievement;  (viii)  strengthening  field-level  monitoring,  (ix)  providing  adequate  infrastructure,  sanitation,  and \nwater facilities for schools; (x) improving delivery of textbooks and adequate learning materials; (xi) strengthening \nthe  resource  base  of  Upazila  Resource  Center  (URC);  the  instructor  and  the  assistant  education officer (AEO) \nshould have M. Ed or B. Ed degree; (xii) strengthening social mobilization activities for increased enrollment and \nretention  rate  for  children  from  poor  households;  (xiii)  restructuring  and  strengthening  SMC  and  PTA  for  their \nactive  participation in school management and planning; (xiv) increasing accountability of the school system to \nthe parents and the community; and (xv) establishing an education committee at local levels (Union Parishad and \nUpazila  level).  Under  the  PEDP  II,  policy  dialogue will be initiated to address equity issues: access to primary \neducation by all children, textbooks distributed to all children, learning materials provided to teachers, and quality \nimprovements in all schools in the primary education sector.  \n\nBasic  education  enables  a  person  to  function  adequately  in  one\u2019s  physical  and  social  environment.  Primary \neducation  is  the  most  important  component  of  basic  education,  which  enables  children  to  acquire  basic \ncompetencies and life skills at an early age. Education improves the life chances of young persons with regard to \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n45\n\nemployment  opportunities \u2014particularly  for  girls \u2014and  it  improves  their  knowledge  and  decision-making \ncapacities. Educating girls would delay marriages and lower fertility rates. Access to primary education by poor, \ndisadvantaged, tribal, and refugee children would enhance their basic competencies and chances for secondary \nschool  education/vocational  training  and  employment  opportunities.  Poor  children  are  forced  to  work  as  child \nlaborers in hazardous  and exploitative forms of employment. These children will be provided with opportunity for \nprimary education.   \n  \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nBangladesh, with a population of 132 million and per capita gross national  product at $350, is one of the poorest \ncountries  in  the  world.  However,  estimates  based  on  the  household  expenditure  survey  (HES)  indicate  that \nincidence of income poverty has declined from over 70% of the population in 1973 to an estimated 36% in 2001. \nProgress  has  been  made  in  improving  Bangladesh\u2019s  human  poverty  index.  Between  1992  and  1998  the  index \nincreased by 49%, with marked improvements in life expectancy, adult literacy, gross primary school enrollment \nratio,  and  decreases  in  infant  mortality  rates,  total  fertility  rates  and  dropout  rates  in  primary  schools.  These \nresults were achieved by continued efforts of the Government and nongovernment organizations to expand the \ncoverage  of  essential  services  to  the  disadvantaged  sections  of  society.  In  particular,  the  shift  in  public \nexpenditures  toward  social  sector  programming  in  the  1990s,  including  primary  education,  has  been  a \ncontributing factor. Yet, Bangladesh still faces severe deficiencies in the quality of health, nutrition and education. \nPoverty  is  cited  by  officials  at  all  levels  in  the  education  system  as  the  major  barrier  hindering  progress  toward \nuniversal  access  to  education.  Research  by  Education  Watch  in  1999  found  that  23%  of  children  were  not \nenrolled  in  school,  and  among  the  enrolled  children,  79%  were  poor.  The  study  found  that  children  from \neconomically disadvantaged families enroll in less numbers, attend less frequently, drop out more, and perform \nless. \n\nAn estimated 6.5 million children in Bangladesh between the ages of 5 and 14 (3.9 million boys and 2.6 million \ngirls) have little option but to work to support themselves and their families. The vast majority, 94%, are employed \nin  the  informal  sector,  mainly  in  rural  Bangladesh.  In  urban  settings,  girls  are  employed  as  domestic  laborers , \nwhile the boys work in small roadside stalls, shops, hotels, or as garbage collectors. Girls and boys both work in \nsmall  factories.  To  provide  poor  children  with  access  to  education,  Bangladesh  has  pursued  strategies  like  the \nfood for education program and stipend program. Both of the programs have been instrumental to a certain extent \nin increasing enrollment of poor children. However, lack of social mobilization program for the parents, poverty, \nmethod and quality of teaching, lack of flexible school hours for poor children, low contact hours between teacher \nand  children,  etc.,  have  kept  the  dropout  rate  of  children  from  poor  families  significant.  The  present  method  of \nteaching and low contact hours provide little opportunity for the children to complete homework in the classroom. \nChildren from poor households are often busy with household chores and especially in the rural areas, children \nwork on family farms or as laborers after school hours. Lack of time, and facilities and the environment in poor \nhous eholds contribute to low performance in school among poor children. Poor performance also affects their \neligibility for stipends. The PEDP II will develop an appropriate social mobilization strategy for the parents and in \nthe  community  to  reduce  the  dropout  rate  of  poor  children.  Increased  contact  hours  between  students  and \nteachers will allow students to complete their homework in the classroom. During implementation, the PEDP II will \ndevelop specific measures, and strategies, and target to address social  and economic constraints faced by the \npoor, disadvantaged/disabled, tribal, religious minority, and refugee children. In access to education, priority will \nbe  given  to  remote  areas  with  ethnic  minorities.  The  monitoring  indicators  will  be  developed  to  address \nconstraints and measure changes in the status of access and quality of education by poor, disadvantage, and \ntribal  and  refugee  children.  Many  of  the  poor  children  are  enrolled  in  RNGPS,  the  PEDP  II  will  put  specific \nemphasis and resources to improve the RNGPS.   \n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nThe  plan  of  PEDP  II  was  prepared  in  discussion  with  various  stakeholders  such  as  the  government,  training \ninstitutes, school management, teachers, and development partners. \n\nTo enhance the participation of parents and the community during implementation of PEDP II, emphasis will be \non  capacity  building  and  active  involvement  of  the  Parent  Teacher  Association  (PTA)  and  the  School \nManagement  Committee  (SMC)  in  school  management  and  planning.  In  addition,  the  role  of  local government \n(Union Parishad) in the local-level education system will be strengthened by forming an education committee at \nthe Union Parishad level. At present the functions of SMC and PTA are limited to occasional meetings. The roles \nof these committees are not properly understood and or accepted in the school management system. The PEDP \nII will restructure and strengthen the SMC and PTA to increase accountability of teachers, to improve attendance \nand lower the dropout rate. \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nThe PEDP II will emphasize social mobilization activities through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for active \ncommunity  involvement  to  raise  the  enrollment  and  completion  rates  in  primary  education  and  promote  the \nmaintenance of school facilities. The SMC will include the following  as members of the committee: mother as well \nas  father  as  representatives  of  parents,  and  female  representatives  of  the  union  council/municipality, \nrepresentatives  from  NGO/civil  society.  The  role,  responsibility,  and  reporting  system  of  SMC  will  be  clearly \ndefined. Similarly the role and responsibility of the PTA will be defined and the PTA will be strengthened through \ntraining and social mobilization activities. PTA meetings in neighborhoods and mothers\u2019 meetings will foster active \nparticipation of parents  in the PTA. The Union Parishad level education committee will consist of members of the \nUnion Parishad, representatives from the SMC, PTA, teachers and NGO/civil society. The local level education \ncommittee will coordinate its work with SMC in union-level planning and management of the school system. The \nexperience of the community contributing to the school maintenance fund under PEDP I will be replicated in the \nPEDP  II.  The  partnership  among  the  parents,  community,  local  government,  and  education  system  will receive \nmore emphasis in PEDP II.  \n \n\nD.

Significant progress has been \nmade  in  enrollment  of  girls  in  primary  education.  Net \nenrollment ratio in 1998 were 80.0% for boys and 82.9% \nfor  girls.  Completion  rates  in  primary  education  are \nhigher for girls at 69% compared with 66% for boys. This \nis  a  significant  achievement  compared  with  other  South \nAsian  countries.  The  goal  to  increase  the  proportion  of \nwomen teacher (60%) at the primary level has met some \nsuccess.

regarded  as  a  public  good,  with  significant \nexternalities  that  may  not  be  adequately  recognized  and  provided  for  by  the  private  sector. \nEnhanced  primary  education  is  strongly  correlated  with  economic  development  and  increased \nproductivity. The main economic arguments follow. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimproved \n\nSocial and private returns. There are high social and private returns to investing in \nprimary  education\u2014cost-benefit  analyses  of  primary  school  education  consistently \ndemonstrate  very  high  rates  of  return.  Moreover,  enhanced  primary  education  is \nstrongly  correlated  with  economic  development  and  increased  productivity.  By \nproviding  the  children  of  Bangladesh  with  enhanced  primary  school  education, \nSecond Primary Development Program (PEDP II), will put them on the road toward \nbetter  employment  and \nincome-earning  possibilities.  Achieving  an \nenhanced level of education and literacy will clearly be a significant factor in breaking \nthe cycle of poverty in the rural areas of Bangladesh. Without PEDP II, the majority \nof  the  labor  force  will  continue  to  lack  quality  basic  education,  which  is  critical  to \nenhancing productive skill levels and raising labor efficiency and productivity rates.  \nEquity. Primary education spending in Bangladesh is pro-poor and the Government \nhas  an  important  role  to  play  in  continuing  to  ensure  that  access  to  education\u2014 \nespecially education of high quality\u2014is equitable. PEDP II interventions, such as the \ntargeted stipend program, and  funds to community-based organizations, private and \nother groups, are aimed at equitability. \nRelationship  with  higher  levels  of  education.  The  Interim  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (IPRSP)  recognizes  that  the  unsatisfactory  performance  of  the \nprimary education system has a ripple effect as it contributes to a significant loss in \nsystemic efficiency. The outputs of a poor quality primary education system proceed \nto the secondary level and higher education levels, and ultimately lead to diminished \nreturns to employability and productivity. PEDP II aims to enhance the quality of the \nthroughout of the primary education system.  \nInformation.  Currently,  there  is  no  systematic  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E) of \nthe  primary  education  system.  The  Government  has  a  crucial  role  to  play  in \nthe  quality  and \ncollecting,  analyzing,  and  disseminating  of \neffectiveness  of  education  provided  in  different  institutions;  in  analyzing  how \nefficiently public versus private sector funds flow through the system and ultimately \nreach teachers and schools, and in determining how those resources are combined \nwith  other  inputs  at  the  school  level  to  generate  education  outcomes.  By putting \neffective  M&E  mechanisms  in  place,  PEDP  II  will  ensure  that  such  information  is \nreadily available and can feed back into policy development. \n\ninformation  on \n\n\f58\n\n  Appendix 11 \n\nRationale for SWAPS \n\n2. \n \nSectorwide  approaches  (SWAPS)1  are  mechanisms  by  which  development  agencies \n2. \n(multilateral  and  bilateral)  collaborate  to  support  sector  reform  programs  based  on  a  country\u2019s \nlong-term  vision  for  its  development.  SWAPS  are  sometimes  known  as  sector/subsector \nprograms  or  sector  investment  programs  or  sector  investment  programs.  SWAPS  are  used  to \nsupport discrete subs ectors, i.e., primary education2 or defined subsectors (geographic regions \nor subnational entities). They have evolved as a means for improving development cooperation \nin the sectoral context, and they aim to  (i) strengthen government ownership, and management \nand coordination of sector activities; (ii) facilitate integration of capital investment budgets in the \noverall  country  budget,  and  the  budgeting  of  sufficient  funds  to  cover  operating  costs;             \n(iii) support the improved performance of government institutions in managing sector resources; \nand  (iv)  reduce  the  burden  and  cost  of  parallel  management  structures  and  the  procedural \ndiversity of multiple externally funded activities.  \n \n3. \nOne of the defining features of SWAPS is the pooling of government and aid funds for \ndisbursement through jointly agreed-upon channels, with aid agencies participating in the pool \nto  finance  agreed-upon  proportions  of  the  overall  sector  program.  This  arrangement  yields \nseveral benefits:  (i)  enables  institution  of  a  single  procurement,  financial  management,  and \ndisbursement system; (ii) reduces the transaction costs of parallel systems; and  (iii) enhances \nthe government\u2019s own fiduciary system.  \n \n4. \nIn  light  of  the  difficulties  encountered  during  Primary  Education  Development  Program \n(PEDP  I)  (numerous,  generally  poorly  performing,  weakly  managed,  low  disbursing  and \noverlapping aid-financed projects), the Government has committed to implement PEDP II as a \nsubsector  approach,  whereby  partners  will  jointly  support  Ministry  of  Primary  and  Mass \nEducation  (MOPME\u2019s)  subsector  program  in  primary  education.  Development  partners  in  the \nsector  strongly  support  the  Government  in  adopting  this  approach.  Therefore  while  the \napproach has downsides and risks, the overriding view is that the benefits of bringing together \nthe government and all major partners and stakeholders under a common framework will result \nin better support:  (i)  government-led and  -managed sector development;  (ii) a comprehensive \nsector policy reform framework; (iii) rationalized sector targets that are appropriately integrated \ninto  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  framework;  and  (iv)  more  cost-effective \nutilization of available sector resources. \n \n\nCost Benefit Analysis \n\n3. \n \n5. \nThe PEDP II is designed to improve access, especially to full 5-year program for primary \nschools,  and  for  the  disadvantaged  and  children  with  special  needs,  as  well  as  improve  the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  the  primary  education  subsector  in  Bangladesh.  The  four  substantive \ncomponents  contributing  to  these  goals  are  (i)  quality  improvement  through  organizational \ndevelopment,  (ii)  quality  improvement  in  schools  and  classrooms,  (iii)  quality  improvement \nthrough infrastructure development, and (iv) improved access to quality schooling. Financial and \ntechnical  resources  are  provided  to  ensure  quality  management,  implementation  and  M&E  of \nthe four components. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2002.

PEDP  II  design  focuses  on  quality  improvements  that  will  establish \n6. \nthe  necessary  foundation  for  a  more  efficient  and  effective  primary  education  system.  The \ninvestment  will  promote  quality  improvements  in  education,  beneficiaries  of  which  will  be  the \nincremental  students  entering  the  education  system  as  well  as  those  who  are  already  in  the \nprimary education stream. Quality improvements will include a lower student-teacher ratio, more \ntextbooks  and  supplemental  materials,  better  physical  facilities,  and  more  student-teacher \ncontact hours for teaching and learning activities. Key improvements that will contribute to the \nsustainable  development  of  better  quality  primary  education  include  the  development  of  high-\nquality initial and in-service training programs for teachers and head teachers which will ensure \ngreater  use  of  classroom  practices  that  are  appropriate  for  teaching  and  learning  basic \ncompetencies,  especially  literacy  and  numeracy,  and  other  foundation  concepts  that  underpin \nlearning  in  everyday  life  and  in  secondary  and  higher  education.  The  provision  of  necessary \nadditional teaching and learning resources will ensure that every school has the basic tools and \naids  to  support  the  new  methodologies.  However,  none  of  these  improvements  will  be \nsustainable  unless  and  until  system  capacity  and  efficiency  are  enhanced.  PEDP  II  will  meet \nthis need through improved human resource development (HRD) strategies and the provision of \nadditional  financial  and  other  resources.  Ensuring  that  these  improvements  go  beyond  the \nurban areas to the furthest regions of Bangladesh will assist in overcoming the  barriers caused \nby remoteness and geography.   \n \n7. \n \n\nEconomic benefits are estimated in accordance with the following assumptions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nPopulation growth rates, based on World Bank projections 3, will be 1.22% for 2002-\n2008, 1.09% for 2009-2015, and 1.38 % for 2016-2020. \nImproved  access  to  primary  education  is  achieved  for  educationally  disadvantaged \nchildren\u2014especially  children  of  minority  groups\u2014through  the  stipend  program, \nenhanced  school  facilities  and  resources,  and  improved  classroom  resources  and \nteaching, i.e.,  \n(a)  The defined gross enrollment rate (GER) target of 106% for primary schooling is \nachieved by 2009. \n(b)  The  defined  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  target  of  88%  for  primary  schooling  is \nachieved by 2009.4 \n(c)  Repetition rates are reduced by at least 20% by 2009 over 2001-2002 baseline \nfigures. \n(d)  Dropout  rates  are  reduced  by  about  45%,  from  33  %  in  2001-2002  to  18%  in \n2009. \nIncremental earnings benefits are calculated on the basis of increased earnings with \neach additional year of primary schooling.   \nThe overall increase in enrollment will be due partially to the stipend program. It is, \nhowever,  not  possible  to  disaggregate  the  proportion  of  students  who  will  receive \nstipends as a result of PEDP II.   \nQuality  improvements  include  reduced  student-teacher  ratios,  improvements  in \nteaching  due  to  increased  teacher  training,  more  textbooks  and  supplementary \nmaterials,  better  physical  facilities,  and  more  student-teacher  contact  hours  for \nteaching and learning activities.

It can be \n\nexpected to increase for some years, but as the NER approaches 100% then the GER will also fall back towards \nparity with the NER. \n\n \n\n\f60\n\n  Appendix 11 \n\nassumes that the targeted increase in contact hours will have a proportional impact \non  the  real  wage  rate  that  each  student  can  realize  for  each  year  of  primary \nschooling completed. \n\n \nCost  Stream.  The  estimated  direct  costs  of  the  PEDP  II  comprise  the  project \n8. \ninvestment, the public and private cost of each additional pupil-year, and the opportunity cost of \nretaining each student in school for an additional year. Public costs are estimated to be equal to \ngovernment  expenditure \n$13.25 (Tk767), and private costs are those incurred by the each pupil's family on school fees, \nbooks and school supplies, transportation, etc., estimated at $17.75 (Tk1,028). The opportunity \ncost  of  retaining  each  student  in  school  for  an  additional  year  is  estimated  at  $226.36 \n(Tk13,106),  that  is  equal  to  the  minimum  wage  for  an  unskilled  worker  with  no  certificates for \nprimary school completion, adjusted for real growth in the wage rate equal to 2% annually. \n\nfor  each  pupil  attending  a  public  primary  school, \n\nthat \n\n9. \nNPV/EIRR.  Based  on  the  assumptions,  PEDP  II  yields  a  net  present  value  (NPV)  of \n$1.22 billion assuming a discount rate of 12%, and an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n13.88%. See Table A11.1. \n\nis,               \n\nTable A11.1.

In \naddition,  the  benefits  are  estimated  for  completion  of  the  primary  cycle  only.  No  allowance  is \nmade  for  the  fact  that  improvements  in  primary  education  will  enable  more  children  to  attend \nsecondary school and thereby have even greater earning power. In addition, it is assumed that \nthe  children  now  enrolled  in  primary  school,  especially  in  the  senior  grades,  will  not  benefit \nbecause they will have completed their primary education (or dropped out) before the full impact \nof the PEDP II is felt. \n\n4.   \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n11. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  based  on  alternative  assumptions  regarding  the  internal  and \nexternal efficiency of the system. For the purpose of the analysis, (i) dropout and repetition rates \n(and  hence  completion  rates)  are  used  as  proxies  for  measuring  internal  efficiency,  and    (ii) \npotential  wage  growth  rate  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  measuring  external  efficiency.  Table  A11.2 \nhighlights the change in the rate of return under different assumptions. \n \n\nTable A11.2.

Similarly,  \u201clow\u201d  external \nefficiency assumes the increase in wage rate achieved is 50% lower than that estimated, while  \n\u201chigh\u201d external efficiency assumes the increase in wage rate achieved is 50% higher than that \nestimated. \n \n13. \nThe findings of the sensitivity analysis clearly indicate that the rates of return are highly \nsensitive to changes in assumptions regarding the external efficiency of the system. If changes \nin internal efficiency are held constant, a 50% change in external efficiency roughly corresponds \nto  a  50%  change  in  the  rate  of  return.  Whereas  if  changes  in  external  efficiency  are  held \nconstant, a 50% change in internal efficiency corresponds to just a 2\u20133% change in the rate of \nreturn. \n \nB.   \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\n \n\nIn  Bangladesh,  as  elsewhere,  the  correlation  between  educational  development  and \n14. \nreduced incidence of poverty, improved in labor productivity, economic growth, and the quality \nof life is well recognized and obvious. Without strengthening the primary, and later, secondary \neducation,  it  will  be  virtually  impossible  for  Bangladesh  to  halt  the  cycle  of  poverty.  This  is  no \nsmall  challenge.  A  large  proportion  of  the  population  is  so  poor  that  the  opportunity  costs  of \nsending a relatively young child to work create a considerable barrier to increasing the years of \nschool  participation,  increasing  the  rates  of  completion,  and  improving  the  quality  of  learning. \nYet, unless parents and the wider community recognize the relevance and benefits of primary \neducation, overcoming these barriers will be very difficult. Improving the quality of schooling is \ntherefore an essential step. Support mechanisms as the stipend program will help by targeting \nchildren  for  whom  the  opportunity  costs  of  nonparticipation  in  primary  schooling  are  high.  By \nsupporting  increased  participation  and  completion,  the  stipend  program  will  negate  the \nopportunity cost. But economic growth and release from poverty will require far more than just \nattending school. The school experience itself must be worthwhile. \n \n15. \nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  acknowledges  the  primacy  of  the \neducational  role  in  combating  and  overcoming  poverty.  By  focusing  on  quality  improvement\u2014\nspecially  in  the  rural  areas  and  across  all  elements  of  the  primary  education  sector,  from \nschools  to  supervision,  from  management  to  monitoring\u2014PEDP  II  translates  the  poverty \nreduction  strategy  into  action-oriented  interventions.  PEDP  II  and  external  support  for  its \nimplementation  will  hasten  the  process  by  which  the  population  of  Bangladesh can become a \nmore literate society, and by so doing provide a stronger foundation on which to build economic \ngrowth and future economic development. \n \n\nPoverty Targeting 5, 6 \n\n1. \n \n16. \nIn  Bangladesh,  investment  in  primary  education  is  generally  considered  strongly  pro-\npoor\u201456%  of  all  government  subsidies  on  primary  education  benefit  the  poor,  who  represent \nroughly 50% of the total population.

Public  resources  cover \nroughly  half  of  education  costs,  but  since  private  or  household  expenditure  is  less  equitably \ndistributed relative to income than is public expenditure (as shown Table 3), the distribution of \ntotal  expenditure  in  education  across  income  quintiles  is  considerably  less  equitable  than  the \nbenefit  incidence  of  public  expenditure.  Private  education  expenditures  are  lower  among  the \npoor,  implying  that  poor  children  have  access  to  fewer  school  supplies  and  other  learning \nmaterials, hampering their learning achievements. In addition, since much of private spending is \ndevoted  to  supplementary  tutoring,  which  the  poor  are  less  able  to  afford,  the  result  might  be \ndirect discrimination by teachers against the poor and less able students since teachers rely on \ntutoring  to  supplement  their  income.  Thus  while  it  is  not  possible  to  ensure  full  equity  in  total \n(public and private) education expenditures between the poor and non-poor, improved targeting \nwill certainly reduce the inequitable distribution of education resources devoted to the poor.  \n \n18. \nStipend  program.  PEDP  II  supports  improved  pro-poor  targeting  of  public  education \nexpenditures  through  the  stipend  program.  In  August  2002  the  Government  of  Bangladesh \napproved a plan to replace the Food for Education Program (FFE) with the stipend program to \ntarget  poor  families  with  primary  school  age  children  in  rural  areas.  The  stipend  program  was \nlaunched in September 2002 to enable poorer rural families, not only to enroll and to keep their \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 11 \n\n63\n\nchildren in school, but also to provide an incentive to  children excluded by poverty to complete \ntheir primary schooling rather than work. \n \n19. \nThe  stipend  program  approved  by  the  Government  for  FY2002/03  amounts  to \napproximately $173 million, and will continue for the next 4 years under PEDP II. The selection \ncriteria7 are aimed at targeting the poorest 40% of enrolled students in primary schools in rural \nareas.  Head  teachers,  in  collaboration  with  their  school  management  committees  (SMC),  will \nidentify the poorest 40% cohort of families who will then receive the stipend. Under the stipend \nprogram, approximately 5 million children attending government schools in rural Bangladesh will \neach receive Tk100\u2013125 a month. \n \n\n2.   \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\n \n20. \nIt  is  currently  estimated  that  53.5%  of  enrolled  students  at  the  primary  level  who  are \n\u201cpoor\u201d8  receive  close  to  55%  of  total  public  subsidies  to  primary  education.  Until  last  year,  the \nFFE program was the main targeted poverty program for primary education, with an allocation \nof  Tk4.61  billion,  or  about  approximately  15%  of  the  total  primary  education  budget  roughly \nestimated  at  Tk30  billion.9  Thus,  if  it  is  assumed  that  the  directly  targeted  poverty  subsidy  is \nequal  to  15%,  then  the  indirectly  targeted  poverty  subsidy  is  equal  to  the  remaining  40%       \n(i.e., 55% minus 15%). \n \n21. \nTo estimate the incremental poverty impact of PEDP II, i.e., with the stipend, recognizing \nthat the stipend program replaces the FFE, two scenarios were evaluated. In the first scenario, it \nis assumed that the proportion of poor students remains constant over time (i.e., 53.5%) and the \nindirectly targeted proportion of education expenditures the poor received also remains constant \n(i.e., 40%). With PEDP II, assuming that the stipend program is well-targeted and there are no \nleakages in the system, the primary education program clearly becomes more pro-poor. By the \nend  of  PEDP  II,  close  to  67%  of  public  expenditures  will  be  targeted  to  the  poor.  Moreover, \nwhile the system does not become more equitable in terms of access (due to the assumption of \na  constant  proportion  of  the  poor  in  the  program),  total  enrollments  of  the  poor  will  rise  to           \n11.2 million by the end of PEDP II from roughly 8.5 million in 2002. \n \nIn the second scenario, it is assumed that, as a result of the stipend program, more poor \n22. \nstudents  are  drawn  into  the  primary  education  system,  i.e.,  the  proportion  of  the  poor  in  the \nsystem rises from 53.5% in 2002 to 56% by the end of PEDP II\u2014with a proportional increase in \nnontargeted expenditures going to the poor. Under this scenario, 76% of public expenditures will \nbe spent on the poor, while enrollment of the poor will rise to about 11.7 million. With the stipend \nprogram, PEDP II will support enhanced equity in the primary education subsector.  \n\n                                                 \n7  The degree to which current criteria ensure that the stipend program in PEDP II reaches its intended target will be \nreviewed during PEDP II annual reviews. Two studies are currently being undertaken (i) assessment of the design \nand targeting of the primary education stipend program by drawing lessons from international experience on such \nprograms;  and  (ii)  assessment  of  the  relative  impacts  of  the  Food  for  Education  Program  and  the  recently \nimplemented primary education stipend program on outcomes at the student, household, school, and community \nlevels. Further studies in support of the review of the stipend program in PEDP II will be undertaken during PEDP II \nimplementation.  \n\n8  Based on working group calculation. \n9  Planning Commission. 2003.
