PEDP II was prepared in consultation with stakeholders \nthrough a Government-led participatory process. Results from an in-\ndepth evaluation of the First Primary Education Development Program  \n(PEDP I) were incorporated as well as lessons learned from other \nsectorwide approach programs (SWAPs) in Bangladesh and in the \nregion. PEDP II is an integrated and coordinated program covering the \nformal primary education subsector. PEDP II will focus on improving \nthe quality of education in primary schools; it will strengthen policy, and \norganizational  and  institutional  development  necessary  to  support \ncoordination,  subsector  planning,  management,  monitoring  and \nevaluation. PEDP II includes a comprehensive policy and institutional \nreform framework, a common set of key performance indicators, and a \ncommon implementation framework for support from the Government \nand its development partners. PEDP II has been designed to be a \ncatalyst  in  achieving  holistic,  sectorwide  planning  in  the  education \nsector  in  the  long  term.  PEDP  II  will  support  the  Government\u2019s \nEducation  for  All  (EFA)  plans,  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and the poverty reduction agenda.  \n   \nRationale  Bangladesh has one of the largest primary education systems in the \nworld. In the year 2001, 17.7 million students were enrolled in over \n78,000 primary-level institutions and were taught by more than 320,000 \nteachers.  This  represented  a  30.8%  increase  in  formal  primary \neducation  enrollments  from  the  level  in  1991.  In  2001,  the gross \nenrollment ratio was 97.5% and girls\u2019 enrollment was slightly higher \nthan boys\u2019. The overall net enrollment ratio was about 81%. \nWhile access to primary education has been provided, its quality has \nstagnated. There are several reasons for the poor performance. The \noverall pupil-teacher ratio is about 55:1, but is 67:1 in Government \nprimary schools (GPS). With the double shift system operating in 90% \nof primary schools, the pupils-in-class-to-teacher ratio is less than 30:1. \nHowever, the double shift system reduces the number of contact hours \nbetween  pupils  and  teachers.  Contact  hours  in  Bangladesh  are \napproximately 30% below the international average. The dropout rate is \nhigh, averaging 33%, due partly to the dire poverty experienced by \nmany families and partly to the perception of many parents and children \nthat schooling is of little value. Average attendance rates are low at \n61% overall. Girls\u2019 attendance is a little better than boys\u2019.  \nThese constraints mean that many children do not receive an adequate \nprimary education. Indeed, the current completion rate is estimated at ", "iv   \nprimary education. Indeed, the current completion rate is estimated at \nonly 67%, while no more than 64% of children starting grade 1 reach \ngrade 5 at the expected time. The average time to complete 5 years of \nprimary education is approximately 6.5 years, reflecting low internal \nefficiency and indicating a significant wastage of scarce resources. \nMany children\u2014perhaps the majority\u2014and even those \u201csuccessfully\u201d \ncompleting grade 5, do not attain acceptable standards of literacy and \nnumeracy, and many lapse into illiteracy once they leave school. Only \n5% of grade 5 pupils attain the standards required for the primary \nscholarship examination.  \n   \nObjective  The  overall  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  universal  primary \neducation and contribute to sustainable socioeconomic development \nand equity in Bangladesh society as envisaged in the MDGs. The \nspecific objective is to provide quality primary education to all eligible \nchildren in Bangladesh.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost is estimated at $1.815 billion equivalent, of which $200 \nmillion equivalent (11%) is foreign exchange cost, and $1.615 billion \nequivalent (89%) is local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  Percent \nADB  31  69  100  5.5 \nIDA   46  104  150  8.3 \nDFID  46  104  150  8.3 \nEC  31  69  100  5.5 \nGovernment of the  15  35  50  2.8 \n  Netherlands \nNORAD  12  28  40  2.2 \nSida  9  20  29  1.6 \nCIDA  6  14  20  1.1 \nGovernment of  1  2  3  0.2 \n  Japan JICA \nUNICEF/AusAID  4  8  12  0.7 \nGovernment of  0  1,161  1,161  63.9 \n  Bangladesh \n Total  200  1,615  1,815  100.0 \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  CIDA  =  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  DFID  = \nDepartment  for  International  Development,  EC  =  European  Commission,  IDA  = \nInternational  Development  Association,  JICA  =  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, SIDA = Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency, UNICEF = United Nations Children's \nFund.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nLoan  Amount  and  It is proposed that Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a loan in \nTerms  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR) \n72,031,000 from its Special Funds resources. The term of the loan will \nbe 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. ADB will finance 5.5% of the PEDP II costs, comprising $31 \nmillion of the foreign exchange cost, and $69 million equivalent of the \n ", "        v\nmillion of the foreign exchange cost, and $69 million equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. Joint grant cofinancing of $389 million equivalent \n(21%)  will  be  provided  from  the  following  sources:  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID), $150 million equivalent (8.3%); the \nEuropean  Commission  (EC),  $100  million  equivalent  (5.5%);  the \nGovernment of Netherlands, $50 million equivalent (2.8%); Norwegian \nAgency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), $40 million equivalent \n(2.2%);  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency \n(Sida),  $29  million  equivalent  (1.6%);  and  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  $20  million  equivalent  (1.1%).  These \nfunds will be administered by ADB and subject to ADB guidelines and \nprocedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services  and  consultant \nselection. International Development Association (IDA) is considering \nproviding a credit of $150 million equivalent (or 8.3%) on standard IDA \nterms. The Government of Japan is considering providing through the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) parallel cofinancing of \n$3  million  equivalent  (0.2%).  The  United  Nations  Children's  Fund \n(UNICEF), in partnership with the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment (AusAID), is considering providing parallel cofinancing of \n$12  million  equivalent  (0.7%).  CIDA  is  considering  providing  an \nadditional  $20  million  equivalent  through  budgetary  support  to  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  will  provide  $1.161  billion  equivalent \n(63.9% of the total cost of PEDP II). \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n    \nExecuting Agency  The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE), acting under the overall \nsupervision of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME), \nwill be the Executing Agency (EA). \n   \nImplementation  MOPME  will  establish  a  program  steering  committee,  headed  by \nArrangements  Secretary MOPME, to oversee the work of DPE and implementation of \nPEDP  II.  A  program coordination unit (PCU) will be established to \nsupport DPE in coordinating, implementing, and monitoring the PEDP II \nthrough DPE line divisions with the support of technical support teams \n(TSTs).  At  the  regional  level,  divisions  and  districts  will  have  key \nsupervisory  and  support  roles  in  implementing  PEDP  II.  However, \nincreasingly  during  implementation,  functional  authority  and \nresponsibility will devolve to the Upazila (subdistrict) and school levels. \nThis shift in the locus of control and accountability will help speed up \nthe  development  process  and  improve  governance.  Support  and \nexpertise  for  this  purpose  will  be  provided  during  PEDP  II \nimplementation. In addition, ADB, as the lead agency, will establish a \nPEDP II Liaison Unit (PLU) within the Bangladesh Resident Mission to \nexclusively  administer  the  implementation  of  the  PEDP  II,  and  to \nfacilitate close liaison with the EA, its PCU, and development partners.  \n \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services under international competitive \nbidding (ICB) will be financed from the ADB loan and cofinanced grant \nfunds administered by ADB. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n ", "vi   \nfunds administered by ADB. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. IDA guidelines will apply to internationally procured \nitems  to  be  financed  by  IDA.  Local  procurement  will  follow  the \nGovernment\u2019s  new  Public  Procurement  Regulations  acceptable  to \nADB. Under PEDP II, civil works contracts are small and unlikely to \nattract the interest of international contractors. They will therefore be \nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  All international and associated domestic consultants will be financed \nfrom the ADB loan and cofinanced grant funds administered by ADB, \nand will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be applied in \nengaging domestic consultants. A total input of about  700 person-\nmonths of international  and over 1,000 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services will be provided. \n \nBenefits and  Key  improvements  will  include  a  reduced  pupil-teacher  ratio,  more \nBeneficiaries  quality textbooks and supplemental materials, better physical facilities, \nmore pupil-teacher contact hours for teaching and learning activities, \nand quality initial  and in-service training programs for teachers and \nhead  teachers,  appropriate  for  the  teaching  and  learning  of  basic \ncompetencies, especially literacy and numeracy, and other foundation \nconcepts that underpin learning in everyday life, and later in secondary \nand higher education. However, none of these improvements will be \nsustainable  unless  and  until  system  capacity  and  efficiency  are \nenhanced. The long-term crosscutting benefits of the comprehensive \nsector program approach adopted will be improved organizational and \ninstitutional development and human resource development strategies, \nand the provision of additional financial and other resources. These \nbenefits  will  ensure  greater  long-term  sustainability  of  primary \neducation services, in both technical and financial terms. Ensuring that \nthese  improvements  reach  beyond  the  urban  areas  to  the  farthest \nregions  of  Bangladesh  will  help  overcome  the  barriers  caused  by \nremoteness and geography. Another crosscutting benefit of the sector \nprogram approach will be the rapid reduction of stand-alone project \nimplementation units, which currently tend to remove key education \nstaff  from  their  regular  positions,  result  in  off-budget  resource \nmanagement,  and  distort  staff  performance  reward  and  incentives \nsystems. Harmonized requirements and procedures of development \npartners of PEDP II in financial management, reporting, procurement, \naudits, monitoring and evaluation, and progress review missions, will \nresult  to  reduced  transaction  costs  of  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners, improved coordination between all parties, and \nstrengthened joint participation of MOPME, DPE, and stakeholders of \nother levels in primary education annual planning.  \n \nOverall, the estimated immediate beneficiaries of PEDP II are (i) about \n16 million pupils in about 65,000 primary schools under the MOPME (ii) \n35,000 new primary school teachers who will receive initial training and \n(iii)  all  40,000  existing  untrained  primary  school  teachers  who  will \nreceive initial training. In addition, the target group of in-service training \nincludes all 320,000 existing trained primary school teachers and head \n ", "        vii \nincludes all 320,000 existing trained primary school teachers and head \nteachers,  including  primary  school  teachers  in  schools  under  the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) administration, who will receive in-service \ntraining through several stages during PEDP II. Over 17 million pupils \nin about 78,000 primary schools will benefit from the in-service training \nof their teachers. \n \nThe Program will put emphasis on improving completion rates, which \nare low for both boys and girls. PEDP II includes cross-cutting gender \nstrategies in all components, and will assist the government to meet its \nquota of 60% female teachers in primary schools. Gender equality \ntraining will be included in teacher training.  \n \nThe Government is implementing within the  PEDP II framework an \nextensive  stipend  program  for  primary  education  targeting  poor \nchildren.  In  addition,  PEDP  II  has  specific  priority  interventions  to \nincrease  access  to  primary  education  by  poor,  disadvantaged, \nindigenous, and refugee children to enhance their basic competencies \nand chances for secondary school education or vocational training and \nemployment opportunities. By the end of PEDP II, enrollment of poor \nchildren  is  expected  to  increase  by  2.7  million\u20133.2  million  poor \nstudents, and 67\u201376% (compared with 55% in FY2001/02) of total \nPEDP II expenditure is expected to have been targeted to the poor.  \n   \nRisks and  To  avoid  the  risks  and  problems  associated  with  coordination  and \nAssumptions  implementation of numerous separate project interventions, and the \nconsequent  lack  of  impact  of  such  interventions  on  quality \nimprovement, the design of PEDP II is based on a comprehensive \nsectorwide  program  approach  acknowledging  that  improvement  of \nquality at classroom level cannot be achieved without improvement at \nthe  systemic  level.  The  implementation  of  a  sectorwide  approach \nembodied in the PEDP II also entails significant risks. Risks have been \nanalyzed, together with lessons learned from previous interventions, \nincluding  sectorwide  program  approaches,  and  a  detailed  risk \nmitigation  plan  has  been  developed  as  part  of  PEDP  II  design. \nOrganizational development, institutional reform, and capacity building \nwill be supported for efficient implementation of the program approach. \nWhile the Government is committed to the sectorwide approach, there \nis the risk that a future government would reverse policy decision on \nthis commitment. However, this risk is not considered high, since the \nsector approach and program modalities are very much linked with \nwider long-term development frameworks of Bangladesh, such as the \npoverty reduction strategy and medium-term expenditure framework.  \n \nFinancial  sustainability  was  confirmed  by  (i)  reviewing  the  general \nadequacy  of  the  existing  revenue  expenditure  budget  allocation  to \nsupport  the  recurrent  cost  of  delivering  public  primary  education \nservices, and (ii) analyzing the implications of the recurring cost of \nPEDP  II  investments.  The  possibility  of  corruption  has  also  been \naddressed. PEDP II includes measures to ensure better governance \nand efficiency in system performance, and transparency in financial \nand procurement management.   \n ", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Primary  Education  Development \nProgram (PEDP II).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Bangladesh has one of the largest primary education systems in the world. The strong \nnational commitment to education over the past 15 years is evident in the rapid growth in \nparticipation and completion rates and strong overall growth in the system of primary education \nas a whole. In the year 2001, 17.7 million pupils were enrolled in over 78,000 primary-level \ninstitutions and taught by more than 320,000 teachers.2 This enrollment represented a 30.8% \nincrease in the formal primary education sector over the level in 1991. The gross enrollment \nratio rose steadily to reach 97.5% in 2001,  girls\u2019 enrollment being slightly higher than boys\u2019. \nOfficial data suggest an overall net enrollment ratio of about 81%. \n \n3.  The overall pupil-to-teacher  ratio  is  about  55:1,  but  is  67:1  in  Government  primary \nschools (GPS). With the double shift system operating in 90% of primary schools, the pupils-in-\nclass-to-teacher ratio is less than 30:1. However, the double shift system reduces the number of \ncontact hours between pupils and teachers. Official data on pupil contact hours in primary \neducation place Bangladesh approximately 30% below the international average of 5,367 hours, \nand the situation is worse in some areas and schools. The high dropout rate, averaging 33%, \nresults partly from the dire poverty experienced by many families and partly from the perception \nof many parents and children that schooling is of little value. Reported average attendance rates \nare low at 61% overall. Girls\u2019 attendance is a little better than boys\u2019 in both urban and rural \nareas. Attendance in urban schools is 64.3%, which is significantly higher than the 56.5% \nreported for rural schools. Children who do attend school regularly go to schools that generally \nlack physical infrastructure and teaching and learning materials. Most have only three relatively \nsmall classrooms with no storage space, and furniture that is unsuitable for use with activity-\noriented teaching and learning methods required in primary education.  \n \n4.  These  shortcomings  mean  that  many  children  do  not  receive  adequate  primary \neducation. Indeed, the current completion rate is estimated at only 67% while no more than 64% \nof children starting grade 1 will reach grade 5 in the expected time. The average time taken to \ncomplete the 5 years of primary education is approximately 6.5 years, reflecting low internal \nefficiency and significant wastage of scarce resources. Achievement testing and research also \nsuggest that many children, perhaps the majority and even those \u201csuccessfully\u201d completing \ngrade 5, do not attain acceptable standards of literacy and numeracy, and many lapse into \nilliteracy once they leave school. Only 5% of grade 5 pupils are able to attain the standard \nrequired for the Primary Scholarship Examination. In addition to a declining primary age cohort, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Technical assistance (TA) from DFID \n(Department for International Development), NORAD (Norwegian Agency Development Cooperation), UNICEF \n(United Nations Children's Fund), European Commission (EC), Government of Netherlands, and World Bank (WB) \ncontributed to the joint preparation process coordinated by the ADB PPTA. ADB led a joint Fact-Finding Mission \nfrom 16 February to 2 March 2003, and a joint Appraisal Mission from 27 April to 19 May 2003. \n2  Government records and PPTA data for school year 2001. These pupil, school, and teacher numbers in para 2 \nreflect the primary education system as a whole including schools under Ministry of Primary and Mass Education \n(MOPME), and Madrasah (religious) schools under Ministry of Education (MOE).  ", "2  \nthe lack of quality in the GPS is perceived to be a major factor in recent declines in enrollment. \nPEDP II seeks to improve the efficiency and quality of primary education as both a foundation \nfor effective economic development and as a poverty reduction mechanism. The PEDP II \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  The low quality of primary education is one of the gravest development problems facing \nBangladesh at the beginning of the 21st century. Government, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and other agencies of civil society acknowledge the many problems facing the system \nand challenging all efforts to build a high-quality primary education subsector. Indeed, during \n1997\u20132003, development partners have worked with the Government on a number of projects \nto alleviate some of the problems. However, focus has been on increasing access rather than \nimproving the quality of education. The analysis of the many problems and challenges, and \nvarious government actions being taken to overcome them are in Appendix 2. Summary is in \nparas. 6\u20139. Problem and constraints analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n  1.  Access and Equity \n \n6.  Demand  side  problems  and  constraints\u2014e.g.,  poverty,  direct  costs  of  schooling, \nopportunity costs, special needs of some children, social and cultural constraints and prejudices \n\u2014prevent children from going to school or from benefiting fully from the educational services \nprovided by the school. Poor and working children, girls, tribal minorities, disabled children, \nchildren in different geographic and educational environments, and refugee children are at \nparticular risk of being marginalized in the formal education system and require specific targeted \nstrategies to achieve equitable enrollment, completion, and attainment. In Bangladesh 40% of \nthe population live below the poverty line, and another 20\u201330% are close to poverty. Hence, \npoverty is probably the most important single factor negatively impacting children\u2019s participation \nin schooling. Poverty is widespread in both rural and urban areas, but its greatest relative \nimpact is in the remote regions and tribal communities of the hill tracts. \n \n  2.  Quality \n \n7.  Supply-side constraints encompass aspects of the school and classroom that limit their \ncapacity to offer adequate and quality education to children in the area. In Bangladesh, these \nconstraints include barriers limiting access to schools; short contact hours; inadequate facilities \nincluding poorly maintained buildings, and lack of sanitation facilities and safe drinking water; \nuntrained or poorly trained teachers using inappropriate teaching methods; lack of teaching and \nlearning resources; teacher absenteeism, etc. Many children begin their schooling in satellite \nschools that occupy rented premises and where untrained and poorly qualified members of the \ncommunity teach without the aid of any resources, except perhaps textbooks. Even the majority \nof the children who live close to a GPS often find that their schools lack classrooms, teaching \nand learning resources, and facilities. The lack of classrooms and teachers means that the \nmajority of schools work on a \u201cshift\u201d system, with classes 1 and 2 attending in the morning and \nclasses 3, 4, and 5 in the afternoon. Contact hours are thereby reduced at each level. Hence \nteachers do not have enough space and time to teach effectively and provide pupils with \nindividual attention to solve learning difficulties and provide remedial help.  \n \n8.  Many teachers, even in the GPS, and a larger proportion of those in other types of \nschools are untrained; those that have been trained, have been poorly trained. The lack of \nteacher quality can be traced back to a low standard of preservice or initial teacher training, and \na similarly low standard of in-service training and professional development. These problems, in \n ", "        3\nturn, have their root cause in the poor quality of the primary education teacher training institutes \n(PTIs), the lack of resources at Upazila (subdistrict) level, lack of effective monitoring and \nteacher supervision resulting in teacher absenteeism, and lack of leadership from the National \nAcademy for Primary Education (NAPE) and the National Curriculum and Textbook Board \n(NCTB). The majority of primary teachers are men (about 62%) and so schools lack the caring \nethos that is typical of primary schools staffed by female teachers and which is regarded as \nmost suitable for young children. In brief, the school does not offer an environment that \nfacilitates and encourages good learning. The enormity of this problem is evident, given that \nprimary education is the foundation on which all other schooling and education is based. \n \n  3.  Systemic Problems \n \n9.  Institutional  constraints  are  policies  and  administrative  arrangements  that  prevent \nchildren from attending school or performing at an acceptable level and limit the capacity of the \nschool to provide effective education. Some examples are the double shift system, weak \norganizational  capacity  throughout  the  Directorate  of  Primary  Education  (DPE),  an \norganizational culture that does not properly value primary education, the overly centralized \nmanagement  and  decision  making,  staffing  policies\u2014especially  the  policy  of  frequent \ntransfers\u2014that lead to discontinuity and inefficiency, inadequate funding arrangements, inability \nto make the most effective use of available funds, and lack of linkages between the formal and \nsubformal sectors. All these problems are evident in Bangladesh, and all are reflected in the \nlack of quality in primary education now available to children throughout the country. The \noverriding  view  is  that  bringing  together  the  Government  and  all  major  partners  and \nstakeholders under a common framework and comprehensive program, including institutional \nreforms, in primary education will better support (i) sector development led and managed by the \nGovernment;  (ii)  a  comprehensive  sector  policy  reform  framework;  (iii)  rationalized  sector \ntargets that are appropriately integrated into the Government\u2019s Medium- Term Expenditure \nFramework (MTEF); and (iv) more  cost-effective use of available sector resources, including \nbalancing  the  recurrent  budget  in  favor  of  nonsalary  expenditure,  which  is  essential  for \nsustainable improvement of the quality of primary education as a whole. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPORT TO THE PEDP II \n10.  The strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Bangladesh focuses on human \ndevelopment through basic education as part of the overall poverty reduction strategy. The \noperational strategy for the education sector aims to (i) increase equitable access to basic \neducation, particularly for girls and disadvantaged groups; (ii) improve educational quality and \nsystem efficiency, particularly in teacher training; (iii) strengthen the institutional capacity to \ndeliver  basic  and  secondary  education;  and  (iv)  support  decentralization  and  community \ninvolvement in education.  \n \n11.  At the Government\u2019s request, ADB has played the lead role in helping the Ministry of \nPrimary and Mass Education (MOPME) prepare for PEDP II. Development partners and other \nstakeholders have been working with the Government and ADB to arrive at a jointly designed \nand agreed upon PEDP II macro plan for primary education, consisting of a policy and reform \nframework, strategies, program, and an investment plan for 2003\u20132009, including subsector \nperformance indicators, priorities for investments, and capacity building. This plan builds heavily \non lessons learned during PEDP I, and from recent ADB-funded projects in primary education. \nA summary is in Appendix 3. Lessons learned from a sectorwide program approach (SWAP) \napplied currently in the health sector in Bangladesh have been incorporated in the PEDP II \n ", "4  \ndesign as well as lessons learned from Pakistan's Social Action Program3. Details are in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n12.  Compared  with  PEDP  I,  PEDP  II  is  a  more  integrated  and  coordinated  subsector \nprogram. PEDP II will focus on improving the quality of primary education and will promote \norganizational  and  institutional  development  necessary  to  support  coordination,  subsector \nplanning, management, and monitoring to ensure efficient improvement of quality. PEDP II \nincludes a common set of key performance indicators and a common framework for support \nfrom the Government and development partners. PEDP II interventions will be supported by a \ncomprehensive policy and institutional reform framework (Appendix 4). The framework has also \nwider sectoral linkages with secondary education, such as restructuring and organizational \ndevelopment of the institutions dealing with both primary and secondary education. PEDP II has \nbeen designed to be a catalyst for achieving holistic, sectorwide planning in the whole education \nsector in the long term. \n \n13.  While at the systemic level PEDP II will focus on formal primary education where the \nvast majority of the children are enrolled, it will also promote Government\u2019s Education for All \n(EFA), achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the poverty reduction \nagenda. PEDP II promotes common learning standards for all types of primary schools, in \nGovernment  schools  and  NGO  schools.  This  approach  will  assist  the  Government  in \nharmonizing the development and quality improvement of the various subsystems and promote \nbetter primary education across the country.  \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s sector loan modality is considered the most appropriate method of financing \nPEDP II.4 ADB\u2019s sector loan criteria have been met. The Government has prepared and \nendorsed, jointly with development partners and in consultation with other stakeholders, a \ncomprehensive PEDP II macro plan to meet the priority needs of the subsector. The capability \nof sector institutions will be supported to implement the plan. Government\u2019s policies for the \nsector will be further strengthened. The ADB sector loan, together with support from other \ndevelopment partners, will assist the Government in implementing PEDP II. PEDP II, and the \nADB sector loan are in line with ADB\u2019s education policy and country strategy. \n \nA.  Objectives \n15.  PEDP II will assist the Government to promote EFA and its poverty reduction agenda, \nwhich are linked with the MDGs. PEDP II has an overall goal of reducing poverty through \nuniversal primary education and contributing to sustainable socioeconomic development and \nequity in Bangladesh society as envisaged in the MDGs. The specific objective is to provide \nquality primary education to all eligible children in Bangladesh.  \n  \nB.  Components and Outcomes \n16.  PEDP  II  has  four  components:  (i)  quality  improvement  through  organizational \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  quality  improvement  in  schools  and  classrooms,          \n(iii) quality improvement through infrastructure development, and (iv) improving and supporting \nequitable access to quality schooling. \n \n17.   Implementation will encompass development activities at central Government level, as \nwell as at school community, Upazila and district levels in all 64 districts of the country. The \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2001. Project Performance Audit Report on the Social Action Program (Sector) Project. Manila. \n4  The concept \u201cprogram\u201d is used instead of \u201cproject\u201d to emphasize the sectorwide program approach of PEDP II, and \nbecause it encompasses all external support to PEDP II. \n ", "        5\nrationale and outline of the components are in paras. 18\u201337. A detailed description of the \ncomponents is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n1.  Quality Improvement through Organizational Development and Capacity \nBuilding \n18.  PEDP I established the absolute importance of policy development, institutional and \norganizational  reform,  and  capacity  building  if  interventions  implemented  through  any \ndevelopment program are to be sustainable in the longer term. PEDP I has also shown the \nnecessity of institutionalizing development programs within the organizational and administrative \nframework of MOPME and DPE. Only in this way can the formal system gain full ownership of \nthe changes and reforms that are offered through the development programs. As a result of \nthese experiences and lessons, PEDP II places the highest priority on capacity building and \nsystemic reform and has determined that capacity building should preferably precede, may \noccur concurrently with, but should never follow, interventions aimed at quality improvement. \nThe interventions in the component have been designed to meet the increasing operational \ndemands that come with a shift in focus from access to quality improvement and to ensure the \nnecessary level of institutional support for development programs.  \n \n19.  A distinctive thrust of PEDP II is to increase authority and accountability, including good \ngovernance and the need to address fiscal and supervisory irregularities in the subsector.  A \ncomprehensive organizational and institutional review and analysis of MOPME, DPE and all \nprimary education institutions at national and all other levels will be completed at an early stage \nof PEDP II implementation. Organizational and institutional capacity building needs of the \ninstitutions will be determined in detail to provide a  quality primary education system and to \nundertake more effectively their present and future roles and functions in primary education \npolicy-making, planning, management, system support, and monitoring. Based on the review \nand  analysis,  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  restructuring  and  capacity  building  will  be \nimplemented during PEDP II.   \n \n20.  Fundamental to the process of quality improvement in primary education is the principle \nof decentralizing and devolving authority and responsibility to middle and local levels of the \neducation system. The initiatives in component 1 are designed to strongly support further \ndecentralization and devolution. PEDP II aims to enhance resources at school level to achieve \nquality improvement in learning and equitable access. In line with this approach, key outreach \nand support mechanisms will be developed at the Upazila level. Teachers, head teachers,  \nschool management committee (SMC) members, Upazila education officers (UEOs), assistant \nUpazila education officers (AUEOs), and staff of Upazila Resource Centers (URCs) will be \nprovided training opportunities emphasizing that PEDP II is a unified effort with one set of goals, \ninterventions, and procedures and with one line of management\u2014the regular line running from \nDPE  to  division,  district,  Upazila  and  school.  This  means  that  all  interventions  to  be \nimplemented in the field \u2014especially in schools and Upazilas\u2014need to be in one strand and \nshould be coordinated with other strands at district and higher levels. \n \n21.  Additional functions will be assigned to schools and Upazilas, which will be strengthened \nthrough provision of infrastructure, staff training and capacity building. In each Upazila, existing \nand new AUEOs and the URC staff will be trained to work together as a team to meet these \nnew responsibilities. This enhanced Upazila education team will inspire, train, and support \nSMCs, head teachers, and teachers in their roles to improve the quality of learning and to \nprovide quality primary education to all children. The enhanced responsibilities at Upazila level \nwill call for professional support and guidance from district level. It is, therefore, essential during \nthe PEDP II period to strengthen the District Primary Education Office by creating a small \nprimary education technical team to lead, train, professionally support, and coordinate the \n ", "6  \nUpazilas. During PEDP II, this new capacity will be made part of the regular organizational \nstructure for primary education.  \n2.  Quality Improvement in Schools and Classrooms \n22.  The interventions supported by this component represent the core quality inputs of    \nPEDP II. These interventions reach all parts of the primary school system and will provide \npositive support for quality improvement at all levels. The complex nature of the education \nsystem  means  that  improvements  in  student  learning  and  outcomes  can  only  arise  from \nimprovements elsewhere. The system has to change. The interventions of this component, \naffecting as they do the schools and classrooms, teachers and head teachers, teaching and \nlearning materials and other resources, the support institutions such as NAPE, NCTB, Primary \nEducation  Teacher  Training  Institutes  (PTIs),  URCs,  and  district  offices,  as  well  as  the \ncommunities in which the schools are located\u2014provide the framework and substance for those \nchanges.  \n \n23.  PEDP I has demonstrated that quality improvement in Bangladesh\u2019s primary schools will \nrequire  many  coordinated  interventions,  including  greater  responsiveness  to  classroom \ncircumstances and the learning environment. Indeed, improving the learning environment in \nschools to provide the foundation for an improved quality of teaching and learning is a key \nobjective of PEDP II. The interventions under this component are designed to ensure that all \nschools meet the primary school quality level (PSQL) criteria: schooling in classrooms that are \nnot overcrowded, suitable staff-student ratios, regular attendance by teachers, one teacher for \neach class or section, and sufficient contact hours to allow quality teaching and learning to take \nplace. \n \n24.  Both NCTB and NAPE have key responsibilities in providing primary education and \ntherefore  must  play  a  key  role  in  quality  improvement.  Both  organizations  will  undergo \norganizational reform and capacity building to develop the resources and skills necessary to \nproperly  meet  their  obligations  and  responsibilities.  Academic  and  technical  support  will \nstrengthen the Primary Curriculum Wing of NCTB and improve primary education through the \nprovision of quality textbooks and materials appropriate to particular grade levels, curriculum \ndevelopment and evaluation, and testing and assessment. NCTB will be supported in its efforts \nto promote continuous school-based assessment as an aid to better teaching and improved \nlearning.  \n \n25.  Despite many constraints, not the least of them the discontinuity of its professional staff, \nNAPE\u2019s mandate to offer a model of capacity building for teacher education and improvement of \nquality in the education system remains a valid one. NAPE will be invested with authority as an \nautonomous body and provided with a stable staff of well-prepared specialists to fulfill its \nmission as an apex institution. In turn, systemic reform, capacity building, and organizational \nreform of NAPE will be supported to enhance its role of setting standards for teacher education \nand engaging in training to effectively and efficiently deliver primary education nationwide.  \n \n26.  However, little of the organizational reform will have much positive impact on children if \nthey are denied the essential tools for learning, in particular literacy. Hence, a basic package of \nteaching aids and core and supplementary reading and learning materials will be provided to all \nGPS, registered nongovernment primary schools (RNGPS), and community schools, including \nsatellite schools. Teachers will be provided with texts, relevant curriculum documents, teachers\u2019 \nguides, aids, and equipment necessary for each class and subject taught. Furthermore, support \nwill be given to ensure that pupils continue to have free texts for every subject and that the texts \nare available from the first day of the school year.  \n \n ", "        7\n27.  The  performance  of  teachers  is  seen  as  the  most  important  element  in  a  quality \neducation  system.  Support  will  be  provided  for  ensuring  appropriate  minimum  criteria  for \nrecruiting trainee teachers, an appropriate minimum level of standards for training teachers, and \na registration system for trained teachers. An appropriate balance between initial teacher \ntraining and in-service training will be emphasized. Support will be provided to improve initial \nteacher training to include both theory and practice and involve regular periods of supervised \npracticum in schools. To achieve this will require an improved system of initial teacher training, \ntogether with a program of extension, upgrading, and refurbishment of the existing PTIs to \nexpand the capacity to meet  immediate teacher supply targets and the longer-term targets \nrequired by EFA policy.  \n \n28.  Support will be provided for reviewing and improving the incentives and rewards for \nprimary teachers to encourage them to maintain and enhance their professional skills through \nprograms  of  in-service  training  and  courses  for  further  qualification.  Support  for  existing \nteachers will ensure regular, preferably annual, professional development or in-service training. \nTherefore, subcluster training will be strongly supported. The in-service program will continue \nthe earlier initiatives of PEDP I to assist teachers to adopt child-centered methods to improve \nteaching quality and pupil learning. Texts, teachers' guides, aids, and equipment for each grade \nlevel and subject taught will be provided. Teacher supervision in the field, in coordination with \nthe  in-service  training  provided,  will  be  important  for  quality  improvement  and  will  be \nstrengthened, drawing lessons from PEDP I projects and also from successful NGO projects. \n \n29.  The quality and authority of head teachers are strong indicators of quality schools. To \nachieve and maintain the proposed quality standards under PEDP II, head teachers will be \ntrained in school management, teacher support and supervision, community mobilization and \nparticipation, and in other areas necessary to facilitate and support quality teaching and learning \nin all grades and classes. SMCs and PTIs will play a significant role in community mobilization, \nwith support from head teachers. Support will be provided for improving selection and promotion \nof well-qualified candidates, including qualified female teachers, for head teacher positions as \nwell as for the reviewing the need to provide them with adequate rewards and incentives. \n \n30.  The original intention for the URCs was to establish institutions at the Upazila level for \nin-service training of primary teachers. However, only about 20% of the planned purpose-built \nURCs were constructed under the various PEDP I projects. Under PEDP II, the URC building \nand implementation program will be completed to provide the necessary sites for the in-service \nteacher training activities and to suggest modifications to their role and the ways in which they \nmay be used, based on the recommendations of the organizational and institutional analysis. \nThere is sufficient evidence to pursue further under PEDP II the original plan for URCs, but with \nan improved concept of how to develop them as key outreach and support mechanisms for \nteachers\u2019 continuous professional development. \n \n31.  Emphasis will be given to the role of the community in increasing the quality of primary \neducation. The community will be mobilized to increase public and community awareness of its \nrole in supporting, monitoring, and advocating quality standards and improvements in their \nschools. Importance will continue to be attached to the role of the SMCs as a planning and \nsupport mechanism for the schools. Communities will be encouraged to participate with SMCs \nin  developing  school  level  improvement  plans  (SLIPs).  Experience  gained  by  NGOs  in \nsuccessful community mobilization will be utilized. \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  \n3.  Quality Improvement through Infrastructure Development \n \n32.  To meet the demand for higher quality teaching and learning, existing infrastructure will \nbe improved. New infrastructure, facilities, furnishings, and equipment as necessary will be \nprovided in Government education offices, PTIs, URCs, and schools. The importance of the \nappropriate type of construction and facilities for schools will be stressed in line with PSQL \nrequirements.  Planning  and  implementing  maintenance  on  a  routine  cyclical  basis  will  be \nsupported  to  ensure  the  longevity  of  the  existing  infrastructure,  facilities,  and  equipment.     \nPEDP II offers an opportunity to provide the required infrastructure to facilitate the shifts in \nteaching and learning styles that are necessary if Bangladesh is to overcome the achievement \ndeficit that is so apparent. In constructing new classrooms, priority will be given to remote areas, \nunderserved areas, and areas of indigenous people. The component brings together all the \ninterventions in other components to improve physical infrastructure, including the provision of \nseparate latrines for girls and boys, water supply, boundary walls, and basic furniture (chairs, \ntables, blackboards, etc.). It does not include the provision of equipment such as computer \nworkstations,  communications  equipment,  which  are  provided  under  the  appropriate \ncomponents. \n \n4.  Improving and Supporting Equitable Access to Quality Schooling \n \n33.  Bangladesh has long recognized, in both constitution and policy, the right of each child \nto education. The gains made over the past decade in the effort to ensure universal primary \neducation are highly commended internationally. However, several million more children are \nunable to access or to successfully participate in and complete primary education. The ultimate \nsuccess of education as a key part of the strategies to reduce poverty and build a cohesive and \nequitable society will ultimately be reflected in the extent to which marginalized children and \ngroups within the community are able to participate fully in all spheres of society and economic \nlife. Their participation in formal primary education is a crucial first step on this pathway. But, for \nthis to happen, there must be a supportive policy and institutional environment at the highest \nlevels of the education system. \n \n34.  Support under this component seeks to rapidly and significantly enhance the institutional \ncapacity  of  DPE  at  central  and  other  levels  to  meet  the  needs  of  children  with  special \nrequirements to access, enjoy, and complete primary education through the formal sector. \nSupport will be provided for policy reforms and interventions that will reduce the demand-side \nand supply-side constraints that prevent millions of children from accessing and participating \nfully  and  successfully  in  formal  primary  education.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  presents  a \nsummary of the Government\u2019s stipend programs. The Stipend Program for Primary Education is \na key intervention within the PEDP II framework for overcoming the poverty barrier to education \naccess. During PEDP II, the criteria for eligibility for various funds available under the PEDP II \nframework, including criteria for eligibility for stipends under the Stipend Program, and its \ngender implications, will be reviewed, and adjusted as necessary.  \n \n35.  PEDP II will also support the implementation of the Rangamati Declaration of Education \npertaining to primary education in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) area and areas with indigenous \npeople.  MOPME  will  collaborate  with  the  Ministry  of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Affairs  in \nimplementing  PEDP  II  in  the  CHT  area.  Flexibility  in  the  criteria  for  recruiting  teachers, \nespecially female teachers, applied elsewhere in the country will be adopted. Also flexibility in \nrecruiting teachers from indigenous people, as well as supplementary learning materials in the \nlocal language will be included in PEDP II. Appendix 5 includes the summary poverty reduction \nand social analysis. Gender strategy is in Supplementary Appendix G. An Indigenous People's \nDevelopment Framework is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n ", "        9\n36.  An estimated 1.6 million children in Bangladesh have some form of disability. About 60% \nof them could attend primary school with little or no adaptations, and 20 % could attend a formal \nprimary school with some adaptations. PEDP II proposes to establish posts in special needs \neducation within the Policy and Operations Division of DPE, as well as new posts for one \nspecial needs education advisor in each district. A task force will be established to devise \nstrategies for mainstreaming children with special needs into primary schools. Annual events \nwill be planned and implemented at the school level during Education Week to raise awareness \nof good health for good education, provide referral services for children with special needs, and \nfacilitate early detection and inclusion of children with disabilities. PEDP II will also provide \nsupport for training teachers and head teachers of children with special needs, encourage \nadditional pedagogical support at the school level for these children, and promote the role of the \ncommunity in meeting the needs of these children. \n \n37.  Access to quality formal primary education will be improved and supported by creating a \nfund to provide innovation grants to support practical and creative ways to enhance the quality \nof education for working children and those living in poverty, especially those in urban areas; for \nchildren with disabilities; and for children from minority communities. This flexible pool of funding \nwill finance innovative programs based on collaboration between communities, government, and \ncivil society. Grants will be awarded for new proposals, or for continuing and expanding existing \ninnovations. Under this component, facilitation and support for innovative pilots emphasizing a \nshift from social mobilization to deeper social development will be very important for the PEDP II \nstrategy. Details of various school-level grants in PEDP II are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n38.  PEDP II is a comprehensive program; the first such program in primary education in \nBangladesh. The PEDP II approach is essentially a systems approach that covers the entire \nsubsector. ADB as the lead development partner will use its sector loan  modality to bring \ntogether resources from major development partners through joint cofinancing arrangements \nand thus adopt a much broader development perspective than might have been possible by \nacting alone through a conventional project mode of working. PEDP II includes design features \nthat emphasize gender and social development as crosscutting dimensions in its components. \nSpecial task forces and advisory committees will be established to assist in preparing and \nimplementing actions plans for gender, vulnerable groups, and indigenous people. PEDP II is \nalso unique in the Bangladesh context in that while being fundamentally pro-poor and pro-\ndisadvantaged children, it is also national in its vision. PEDP II seeks to create the environment \nfor nationwide improvement in primary education. The broad program perspective does carry \nspecial responsibilities. ADB, having led the PEDP II planning process will now lead in ensuring \nthat the program implementation arrangements are user-friendly while meeting standards for \ngood governance and financial management. PEDP II will improve on the previous fragmented \nprojectized approach of PEDP I by bringing the Government and development partners together \nunder one coherent program.  The transaction costs of both the Government and development \npartners  are  reduced  and  efficiency  of  the  coordination  increased  through  harmonized \nrequirements and procedures of development partners in financial management, reporting, \nprocurement, audits, monitoring and evaluation, and progress review missions. This partnership \nof the Government and its development partners is a powerful impetus for reform. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n39.  The total cost of PEDP II is estimated at $1.815 billion equivalent, of which $200 million \n(11%) equivalent comprises foreign exchange, and $1.615 billion (89%) equivalent comprises \n ", "10  \nlocal  currency.  Table  1  summarizes  the  costs.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  presented  in \nAppendix 6.

Financing Plan \n40.  The total cost of PEDP II is estimated at $1.815 billion, of which $1.161 billion is the \nGovernment contribution (64% of the total cost) and $654 million equivalent will be provided by \nthe development partners (36%). The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. Based on a \nreview of historical financing trends, macroeconomic forecasts of the International Monetary \nFund  (IMF)  and  the  Government,  and  priorities  as  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  National \nPoverty Reduction Strategy and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), it is estimated \nthat Government counterpart financing can be made available in the order of $1.1\u20131.2 billion  \n(inclusive of the Government\u2019s stipend program) for the six-year PEDP II period. \n \n41.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $100 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources. The term of the loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB \nwill finance 5.5% of the PEDP II costs, comprising $31 million of the foreign exchange cost, and \n$69 million of the local currency cost. Joint grant cofinancing of $389 million equivalent (21%) \nwill be provided from the following sources: Department for International Development (DFID), \n$150 million equivalent (8.3%); the European Commission (EC), $100 million equivalent (5.5%); \nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands,  $50  million  equivalent  (2.8%);  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment  Cooperation  (NORAD),  $40  million  equivalent  (2.2%);  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  $29  million  equivalent  (1.6%);  and  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency (CIDA), $20 million equivalent (1.1%). These funds will be \nadministered by ADB and subject to ADB guidelines and procedures for procuring goods and \nservices  and  selecting  consultants.  The  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  is \nconsidering providing a credit of $150 million equivalent (or 8.3%) on standard IDA terms.

Coordination, Management, and Implementation Arrangements \n42.  The scale and coverage of PEDP II will require a strong coordination and management \nstructure, and an effective strategy to maintain coordination and synergy between PEDP II \ncomponents and various levels of the primary education system, and support sustainability and \ninstitutionalization of interventions and reforms. It is imperative, therefore, that a dedicated \norganizational unit supports the executing agency (EA) in keeping close track of, and control \nover,  the  many  activities  until  they  can  be  more  fully  absorbed  into  the  Government\u2019s \norganizational  structures  and  institutionalized  as  part  of  routine  service  delivery.  The \norganizational structure designed for managing PEDP II will encourage and provide for a \nholistic,  cohesive,  and  integrated  subsector  approach  in  which  the  whole  plan\u2014its  goals, \nstrategies, and outcomes\u2014will be kept in view and not just the specifics of separate elements. \nAs PEDP II gains momentum, adjustments will be inevitable to respond to shifting conditions, \nnew insights, and unforeseen events. While many issues can, and should be dealt with at the \nlower levels of Upazilas and districts, central guidance, oversight, and decision making will be \nrequired to ensure that PEDP II focus and integrity are maintained.  \n \n43.  A central process of continual review will be instituted so that lessons derived through \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) are reflected in continuing changes to PEDP II plans and \nimplementation. This is particularly important since PEDP II represents a shift of focus from \n ", "12  \naccess and participation to quality improvement, with emphasis on student achievement and \nquality of outcomes. This means that the primary sector cannot continue doing simply more of \nthe same, but must incorporate new dimensions, inputs, and processes not currently offered or \nsupported. Consequently, assistance will be needed to both develop and transform services and \ntheir delivery. Through MOPME and DPE, PEDP II creates the opportunity for the government \nto review current operational systems and procedures and to institutionalize \u201cbest practice.\u201d \nThrough  sectorwide  program  financing  and  decentralized  implementation  with  increased \nauthority comes the need for increased responsibility for product and proper use of resources. \nEffective  monitoring  will  ensure  objective,  transparent  tracking  and  reporting  of  education \ninvestment activities and will provide the EA with timely information for efficiently planning and \nmanaging  of  primary  education  at  various  levels.  It  also  strengthens  professionalism  and \naccountability of primary education institutions. By strengthening the M&E strategy, PEDP II will \nsupport a mechanism that allows for and guides adjustment and change, gives warning of likely \nfailure or success, and uncovers both weaknesses and strengths.  \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n44.  DPE, acting under the overall guidance of MOPME, will be the EA and will integrate the \nPEDP II activities to the extent possible within its regular administrative structure. The EA will be \naccountable for making program implementation adhere to Government and ADB procedures \nand guidelines,5 as well as for overall transparency and accountability in using PEDP II funds. \nMOPME will establish a program steering committee (PSC) to oversee the work of DPE and the \nprogram coordination unit (PCU), and the implementation of PEDP II. The PSC will consist of \nsenior-level representatives from Ministry of Education (MOE), Economic Relations Division \n(ERD), NAPE, Planning Commission, Finance Division, DPE, Implementation Monitoring and \nEvaluation Division, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts \nAffairs, Ministry of Establishment, Public Service Commission, Local Government Division, \nMinistry of Social Welfare, as well as adequate representation from districts and Upazilas. The \nPSC may co-opt other members as necessary. The secretary MOPME will chair the PSC, and \nthe director general (DG) of DPE will act as member secretary. The PSC will meet whenever \nnecessary but, in any case, not less than once every quarter.  It will (i) approve the annual \nprogress report, annual operation plans, as well as the supporting budgets; (ii) provide overall \npolicy and operational guidance in implementing the PEDP II and decide on corrective action if \nneeded; (iii) undertake interministerial coordination essential to achieve the reforms under \nPEDP II; and (iv) resolve issues and conflicts that may emerge during PEDP II implementation. \n \n45.  The DG of DPE will be the program director. A PCU comprising international and \ndomestic consultants will be established under the DG to assist DPE in coordination of the \nsupport for the PEDP II from the Government and from the development partners. The PCU will \nbe responsible for the day-to-day coordination of PEDP II, and M&E of progress in implementing \nit  through  line  divisions  of  DPE  with  the  support  of  technical  support  teams  (TSTs)  also \ncomprising international and domestic consultants. More specifically, the PCU will help DPE (i) \nprepare the 3-year program implementation plans; (ii) prepare the annual operational plans; (iii) \ncoordinate procurement activities; (iv) prepare and maintain financial records, accounts, and \nstatements; (v) prepare all consolidated progress reports, including the midterm review report, \nas well as the program completion report; (vi) organize M&E activities; (vii) coordinate the work \nof the TSTs; (viii) liaise on program implementation matters with ADB; and (ix) review the M&E \nreport prepared by the Monitoring and Evaluation Division of DPE for annual review missions. \nThe organization structure for PEDP II at DPE is presented in Appendix 7. Since the structure \n                                                 \n5  ADB rules and regulations apply to the administration of the major part of PEDP II external funds (i.e., ADB loan \n  and grant funds under ADB administration, provided as joint cofinancing). For parallel cofinancing within the  \n  PEDP II framework, rules and regulations of the parallel financiers apply. \n ", "        13\nhas been designed specifically to facilitate transition from a project approach to a sectorwide \nprogram approach in primary education, the structure will be jointly reviewed and fine-tuned as \nnecessary in the light of the needs of the transition process.  ADB will establish a PEDP II \nLiaison  Unit  (PLU)  within  the  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission  to  exclusively  administer  the \nimplementation of the PEDP II, and to facilitate close liaison with the EA and its PCU, and the \nPEDP II development partners. ADB will assign adequate staff to the PLU.   \n \n46.  Implementation  within  each  PEDP  II  component  will  be  under  the  leadership  and \ncoordination  of  DPE  line  directors.  The  TSTs  will  relate  to  each  of  the  main  PEDP  II \ncomponents. It is important that support from TSTs be closely interlinked. Each line director and \nhis/her staff will, with the support of TSTs, manage, guide, direct, facilitate, and supervise the \nspecific interventions undertaken within the component. At the regional level, divisions and \ndistricts  will  have  key  supervisory  and  support  roles  in  implementing  PEDP  II.  However, \nincreasingly throughout implementation, functional authority and responsibility will devolve to the \nUpazila and schools. This shift in the locus of control and accountability will help speed up the \ndevelopment process and improve governance. Decentralizing the planning and management \nfunctions to the Upazila level will be supported by a strategy of developing and institutionalizing \nan  interactive  bottom-up  process,  articulated  through  the  school  and  Upazila  improvement \nplans, so that the Upazila education office becomes the focal point for primary education \nplanning  and  management  as  well  as  M&E.  The  organogram  of  primary  education  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n  2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The PEDP II will be implemented for 6 years from January 2004 to December 2009. The \nimplementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. A phased transition period, starting from July \n2003  (i.e.  beginning  of  the  government  fiscal  year  2003/2004),  is  being  implemented  by \nMOPME, DPE and development partners to ensure a smooth transition from PEDP I projects \ninto PEDP II as a subsector program.  \n \n3.  Subprogram Selection and Processing6 \n \n48.  Support to PEDP II is based on a sector loan modality. Sector loans may finance the \nsector investment needs in a specified geographic area (area slice) or may support the whole \nsector in the developing member country (DMC) over a specified period (time slice), or both.7 In \ncase of support to PEDP II, it is considered appropriate to designate each Annual Operation \nPlan (AOP) as a subprogram (time slice). This is important to enhance the PEDP II program \napproach and strategies for primary education sector, and to support the Government\u2019s role in \nsectorwide operational planning and implementation. To facilitate PEDP II implementation, the \nGovernment, aided  by the PCU, will prepare and submit to ADB and PEDP II development \npartners 3 months before the start of each fiscal year (by 1 April) an AOP for the coming year. \nThe AOP will meet the following criteria: (i) it is prepared in consultation with and data collected \nfrom stakeholders of PEDP II at various levels of the system; (ii) it includes fully costed activities \nfor each output, linked with performance targets of PEDP II; (iii) it includes details of how PEDP \nII activities are to be integrated into Government structure and ongoing activities at DPE, \ndivision, district, Upazila, and school levels; (iv) it allocates adequate resources and counterpart \nfunding in the Government recurrent budget for PEDP II; and  (v) it is in line with the 3-year \nimplementation plan prepared for PEDP II. The AOP for the first year will be finalized at \ninception of PEDP II. \n \n                                                 \n6  The concept \u201csubprogram\u201d instead of \u201csubproject\u201d is used to emphasize the sectorwide program approach of  \nPEDP II (footnote 4).  \n7  Sector Lending. Operations Manual, Section 5, para. 3. \n ", "14  \n4.  Procurement \n49.  Following the Country Procurement Assessment, the Government established a Central \nProcurement Technical Unit under Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation Division of the \nMinistry of Planning. The unit's mandate is to manage the public sector procurement reform \nprogram; prepare and issue public procurement regulations; introduce in all public procurement \nstandard bidding documents for goods, works, and professional services; revise the delegation \nof powers and the procurement approval process; publish contract awards; introduce appeal \nprocedures and a code of ethics for procurement staff; and establish regular training programs \nto develop the required human resources. The procurement reform has been designed to \nsupport  decentralized  procurement  and  is  highly  relevant  to  the  needs  of  PEDP  II.  The \nimplementation of local procurement through local competitive bidding (LCB) for PEDP II will \ntake into account the recommendations of the current Government procurement reform, and \nfollow  the  new  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003.  Intensive  training  for  undertaking \nprocurement and other capacity-building interventions will be provided in PEDP II for DPE and \nother levels. Training will be synchronized and coordinated with the training provided under \nprocurement  reform.  The  PCU,  working  closely  with  functional  DPE  divisions,  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating procurement under the guidance and supervision of the PSC. Line \ndivisions of DPE and districts will undertake local procurement. Procedures, manuals, and \nsystems for monitoring procurement will be established. Before any procurement starts, the EA \nwill submit to ADB for approval a list or lists of the goods to be procured, grouping of the goods, \nand the proposed number and scope of civil works to be awarded. Indicative procurement \npackages  to  be  financed  under  PEDP  II  are  presented  in  Appendix  9.  Details  of  the \nprocurement reform are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \na.  Civil Works \n \n50.  Civil works will focus on constructing, or rehabilitating, as applicable, 30,000 classrooms \nto (i) have the capacity to accommodate the projected increase in enrollment; (ii) facilitate the \nuse of student-centered and activity-based methods most suitable for young children and for \ndeveloping basic competencies; and (iii) increase the proportion of schools operating on a \nsingle shift, with the associated increase in contact hours. Other construction will provide for \nincreased capacity and enhanced quality of the teaching and learning environment at PTIs, as \nwell as for greater capacity at the district and Upazila levels. Without exception, the concern in \nproviding for civil works is to support other measures designed to improve quality in system \noperation, service delivery, teacher performance, and student attainment. PEDP II civil works \ncontracts will not exceed $500,000. They are unlikely to attract the interest of international \ncontractors  and  will  therefore  be  awarded  by  LCB  procedures  as  described  in  Public \nProcurement  Regulations  2003,  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  below  the \nstatement of expenditure limit of $100,000 will be permitted only on a case-by-case basis. The \nGovernment will submit, through the PCU, details on the number and scope of civil works for \nADB approval, before withdrawing for any expenditure for civil works. Efforts will be made to \nlimit the number of contracts, engage larger professional contractors, and award contracts to \nprequalified contractors to be managed by the Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED) in accordance with  Public Procurement Regulations 2003. All construction will be \nlocated on land owned by the Government. The Government has assured that no resettlement \nof people will be involved. The Government has also assured that all contractors will comply \nwith applicable labor legislation, including that on child labor.  \n \nb.  Equipment and Materials \n \n51.  Vehicles, computers and accessories, and weighing scales will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) for packages above $500,000 and international shopping \n ", "        15\n(IS) for packages below $500,000, financed from the ADB loan and cofinanced grant funds \nadministered by ADB, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. NCTB will procure \nprinting  paper  through  ICB,  with  IDA  financing  in  accordance  with  IDA\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Office and school furniture, printing and binding of books, and miscellaneous \noffice equipment will be procured through LCB procedures for packages between $100,000 and \na $500,000, financed from the common pool of funds managed by the EA and supervised by \nADB,  in  accordance  with Public Procurement Regulations 2003. To ensure economy and \nefficiency, goods of similar nature will be grouped into packages under one or more bids and the \nPCU will coordinate and support DPE in undertaking central procurement. Contracts will be \nawarded on the basis of a least-cost combination of packages.  \n \n  5.  Consulting Services  \n \n52.  All international and associated domestic consultants will be financed from the ADB loan \nand  cofinanced  grant  funds  administered  by  ADB,  and  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Since the organization structure of the \nPEDP II is expected to be adjusted during implementation due to transition from a project \napproach to a sectorwide program approach in primary education, the role of the PCU within the \nstructure and the terms of reference for PCU consultants should be adjusted accordingly. In \naddition, given the importance of PCU in assisting DPE in coordination of PEDP II and quality \nimprovement of primary education, it is of utmost importance that best consultants available will \nbe selected for the PCU. Therefore, quality-based selection method will be used for selection of \nconsultants for the PCU. Quality- and cost-based selection method will be used for TSTs. For \nsmall  consulting  services  contracts  for  supervision  of  civil  works  and  for  M&E,  domestic \nconsultants will be selected in accordance with Public Procurement Regulations 2003. A total of \nabout  700  person-months  of  international  and  over  1,000  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants will be provided to help implement PEDP II activities through long- and short-term \ncontracts. With regard to the number of individual consultants and the number of person-\nmonths, the aim is to ensure quality inputs while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to \nemerging needs. Indicative contract packages of consulting services are in Supplementary \nAppendix M. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n6.  Advance Action \n \n53.  Given the need to have the PCU operating after loan effectiveness, ADB has approved \nadvance action for recruiting consultants for the PCU and for procuring office equipment and \nvehicles for the PCU and DPE offices. The Government has been advised that such advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance the PEDP II. ADB will, as requested by the Government \nand on behalf of the EA, directly shortlist consultancy firms, invite proposals, and evaluate and \nrank them for the PCU consultants (consultancy package A). The EA will negotiate the contract. \n \n7.   Disbursement Arrangements \n54.  Based on arrangements in bilateral agreements between the grant cofinanciers and \nADB,  the  grant  cofinanciers  will  disburse  their  funds  to  ADB  for  administration  as  jointly \ncofinanced funds. For ADB loan funds and ADB-administered jointly cofinanced funds, the \nproceeds will be advanced to the Borrower and deposited in dollar imprest accounts. For IDA \nfunds, the credit proceeds will be advanced to the dollar special account. The dollar imprest \naccounts and the dollar special account will be held in a commercial bank nominated by the \nFinance Division of the Ministry of Finance, and acceptable to ADB and IDA. The Borrower can \nthen transfer funds from the imprest/special accounts and convert the dollars into the common \npool taka account as needed. To pay contractors, suppliers, and other beneficiaries, the EA will \n ", "16  \npay with two checks: one from the common pool taka account for the externally financed portion \nand the other from the Government\u2019s Treasury account. \n \n55.  On a quarterly basis or earlier, the EA can apply to ADB for liquidation/replenishment of \nthe  imprest/special  accounts.  The  withdrawal  application  must  include  a  statement  of \nexpenditures (SOE). One common SOE format agreed upon by the ADB, joint cofinanciers and \nthe  IDA,  will  be  used  to  harmonize  financial  reporting.  ADB  will  review  the  withdrawal \napplications and will approve eligible expenditures to replenish the imprest accounts. Acting on \nADB\u2019s advice, IDA will transmit the funds requested by the EA. SOE procedures will apply for \nindividual  payments  of  less  than  $100,000.  Operations  of  the  dollar  imprest  and  special \naccounts  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  IDA\u2019s  loan  disbursement  handbooks, \nrespectively, and in accordance with the Disbursement Procedure Manual. The financing share \nof each development partner for PEDP II expenditures will be based on the annual allocation \nagreed upon at the beginning of every fiscal year of the Government. In addition, before a \ncontract is signed, full funding of the contract must be available from the Government and the \ndevelopment partners. A diagram showing fund flows is in Appendix 10. During PEDP II, \nsupport will be provided to improve the capacity of DPE and MOPME in financial management \nand procedures in line with the program approach. Details are in Supplementary Appendix O. \n \n8.  Accounting, Financial Auditing, and Reporting \n \n56.  DPE, assisted by the PCU, will maintain consistent records, accounts, and related \nfinancial statements adequate to identify goods and services financed under PEDP II. DPE, \nassisted by the PCU, will submit quarterly financial reports to ADB according to ADB\u2019s rules and \nregulations. Only one reporting format and system will be maintained for funds in the common \npool, which include funds received from ADB (loan, and grants under ADB administration), and \nfunds from IDA.  ADB will share copies of the reports with the development partners which \nprovide grants under ADB administration (joint cofinanciers) and IDA. Independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit the PEDP II accounts and related financial statements each year in \naccordance with sound auditing standards. The audited accounts and financial statements and \nthe auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \nThe annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest and special accounts and SOE, and \na separate audit opinion on their use. Additional financial audits will be undertaken through ADB \nfrom time to time in accordance with agreed upon rules and regulations. \n \n9.  Program Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \na.  Key Performance Indicators \n57.  Based on the PEDP II components and objectives, a set of draft key performance \nindicators for policy, outcomes, systems, and process has been developed (Supplementary \nAppendix P). The indicators will be finalized at PEDP II inception.  \n \nb.    Baseline Survey \n \n58.  EFA indicators that are suitable for the baseline survey and currently available through \nthe  Education  Management  Information  System  (EMIS)  cell  of  DPE  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix Q. In addition, data established by the ADB-funded Primary School \nPerformance Monitoring Project8 will be used. Baseline indicators will be finalized at PEDP II \ninception. The capacity of DPE to plan and lead the process of further gathering and analyzing \nbaseline data and undertake M&E at all levels will be strengthened starting from the PEDP II \ninception stage. Also the role of communities and SMCs will be emphasized in M&E. \n                                                 \n8 ADB.2002. Technical Assistance for Primary School Performance Monitoring. Manila. \n ", "        17\nc.  External Monitoring and Evaluation \n59.  When weighting the advantages and disadvantages of arrangements for external M&E \nof PEDP II, it is important to aim for optimum arrangements that ensure enough independence \nand external oversight on one hand, and provision for building local capacity for external M&E \non the other hand. The best option is to undertake external M&E under the management of the \nPEDP II Liaison Unit (PLU) to be established under ADB. The PLU will outsource external M&E \nservices, such as studies, formative research on the PEDP II implementation process, and \nperformance audits, as required, from local institutions and the private sector, including NGOs \nwhere  appropriate.  In  addition,  Implementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the \nMinistry of Planning will undertake, according to its standard mandate, external M&E. Feedback \nfrom beneficiaries, including parents and pupils, will provide important data for external M&E. \n \nd.  Program Performance Management System \n \n60.  A comprehensive performance management system will be established for PEDP II. The \nPEDP  II  common  framework,  the  comprehensive  set  of  verifiable  indicators,  and  the \ncoordinated and integrated M&E procedures and systems to be established by DPE Monitoring \nand Evaluation Division together with DPE line directors will ensure comprehensive and timely \nprogress reporting. DPE, supported by the PCU, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly \nprogress reports on PEDP II implementation, within 3 weeks after the end of each quarter, with \ncopies to PEDP II development partners. The progress report will follow a format agreed upon \nat PEDP II inception.   \n \n61.  The  progress  reports  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against \nestablished targets; (ii) problems encountered during the period and remedial actions taken or \nproposed to resolve the problems; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed \nimplementation activities to be undertaken and physical and financial progress expected during \nthe succeeding quarter, including detailed contract awards and disbursement projections. DPE \nwill prepare a program completion report and submit it to ADB and the development partners \nnot later than 3 months after physical completion of the PEDP II. The report will analyze overall \nprogress, achievement of outputs, compliance with the loan covenants, and will include costs. \n \n62.  The performance management system will determine whether the inputs delivered for \nimplementing the PEDP II activities have yielded the expected outputs and benefits to the \nintended beneficiaries. Gender segregated data will be used. The performance management \nsystem will include also public expenditure tracking. It will seek to detect any deficiency in and \ndiscrepancy between the operational plan and execution in using the resources efficiently, so \nthat timely corrections can be made to update the plans to improve benefits, outcomes, and \nimpact. Information from progress reports, annual reviews, the midterm review (MTR), and from \nexternal M&E studies will be also utilized. Impact M&E will provide valuable qualitative data to \nsupport improvement of PEDP II during its lifetime. \n \n10.  Program Review \na.  Annual Reviews and Thematic Reviews \n63.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  development  partners  will  jointly  review  the  PEDP  II \nannually. AOPs will be the main focus of annual reviews undertaken jointly by the Government \nand development partners. The jointly agreed-upon AOP will be the basis for implementing and \nfinancing PEDP II in each fiscal year. The annual review will determine compliance with specific \nloan covenants and whether all required inputs and support functions on the Government side \nare in place. The review will also evaluate the effectiveness of implementation mechanisms and \nthe  efficiency  of  the  organizational  development  and  capacity  building  for  the  program \n ", "18  \napproach, and may result in a decision to continue them or to adjust them. Joint reviews will \nspecifically  (i)  analyze  the  results  of  the  previous  year,  (ii)  identify  adjustments  needed, \n(iii) assess the impact of the program on poverty reduction, (iv) assess program contributions to \nthe improvement of the quality of primary education, (v) assess implementation performance \nagainst agreed-upon indicators in the program framework and adjust indicators as needed, (vi) \nidentify primary education policy issues, and (vii) identify constraints to program implementation. \nSpecial attention will be given to (i) the effectiveness of program strategies for promoting greater \nparticipation of girls and disadvantaged groups; (ii) progress on key program innovations, and \nassessing  learning  outcomes  and  quality  of  teaching;  and  (iii) coordination of interventions \nwithin the program, and integration of program activities in the government structure. In addition \nto AOPs, a detailed 3-year implementation plan (up to the MTR) will be prepared at inception, to \nreflect the Government\u2019s 3-year rolling plan cycle, and will be updated on the basis of an annual \nplanning cycle. Draft versions of the first year AOP, and the 3-year implementation schedule are \npresented in Supplementary Appendixes R and S. \n \n64.  To promote achievement of the key outcomes of PEDP II, up to 25% of the pooled funds \nwill be released on the basis of performance, as measured by milestones that will combine \nprocess, system and policy outcome indicators, as reflected in the PEDP II policy matrix and \nkey performance indicators. With at least 75% of pool funds representing predictable financing, \nfunding of key school level objectives of the program will be protected. The aim is to provide \nincentives for achieving benchmarks in the reforms, and for ensuring that during implementation \nand annual reviews adequate and consistent attention will be given to policy and institutional \nreforms  which  are  necessary  for  achieving  sustainable  improvement  in  quality  of  primary \neducation. Performance-based financing triggers and allocations will be decided during the joint \nannual reviews, taking into consideration progress in reforms during the AOP under review, and \nthe AOP prepared for the following year.  The Government, ADB, and PEDP II development \npartners will document their agreement on these issues in the review reports. In addition to the \njoint annual reviews, shorter thematic reviews will be held once a year. \nb.  Midterm Review  \n65.  The Government, ADB, and other development partners will jointly undertake a MTR at \nthe end of year 3 of PEDP II implementation to assess progress in meeting the long-term vision \nfor primary education in Bangladesh, as presented in the Government\u2019s action plan. The MTR \nwill evaluate (i) PEDP II scope, design, and implementation arrangements, and institutional \nchanges; (ii) implementation progress against agreed upon indicators in the AOPs and the 3 \nyears  implementation  plan;  (iii)  procurement  performance;  (iv)  PCU  effectiveness;  (v) \nperformance of consultants; (vi) fund flows and arrangements; (vii) the geographic coverage of \nUpazila Primary Education Plans (UPEPs) and SLIPs and their operation; (viii) progress in \nimplementing the gender action plan, the vulnerable groups action plan, and the action plan for \nindigenous peoples; (ix) lessons learned; any (x) other issues agreed upon by the Government, \nADB, and other development partners. No later than one month before the MTR, DPE will \nsubmit to ADB a comprehensive report covering the above issues. Feedback from civil society \non PEDP II implementation will also be sought during MTR. The MTR will recommend changes \nin program design and implementation arrangements, as necessary.  \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits \n66.  The PEDP II design focuses on quality improvements that will establish the necessary \nfoundation for a more efficient and effective primary education system. The investment will \npromote quality improvements in education, the beneficiaries of which will be the new students \nentering the education system as well as those who are already in the primary education \n ", "        19\nstream. Quality improvements will include a reduced pupil-teacher ratio, an increase in the \nnumber of textbooks and supplemental materials, better physical facilities, and an increase in \nthe  number  of  pupil-teacher  contact  hours  for  teaching  and  learning  activities.  Key \nimprovements  that  will  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  better  quality  primary \neducation include the development of high quality initial and in-service training programs for \nteachers and head teachers. The training programs will ensure greater use of classroom \npractices that are appropriate for teaching and learning basic competencies, especially literacy \nand numeracy, and other foundation concepts that underpin learning in everyday life, and later \nin secondary and higher education. Providing the necessary additional teaching and learning \nresources will ensure that every school has the basic tools and aids to support the new \nmethodologies. However, none of these improvements will be sustainable without enhanced \nsystem capacity and efficiency. The long-term crosscutting benefits of the comprehensive sector \napproach adopted will be improved organizational and institutional development, and human \nresource development strategies, and the provision of additional financial and other resources \nthat will ensure greater long-term sustainability of primary education services, both technically \nand financially. Ensuring that these improvements reach beyond the urban areas to the furthest \nregions of Bangladesh will help overcome the barriers caused by remoteness and geography. \nAnother crosscutting benefit of the sector approach adopted will be the rapid reduction of stand-\nalone project implementation units, which currently tend to remove key education staff from their \nregular positions, result in off-budget resource management, and distort staff performance \nreward and incentives systems. The program approach of the PEDP II includes harmonized \nrequirements and procedures of development partners for financial management, progress \nreporting,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  local  procurement,  and  review  missions.  Hence,  the \napproach will reduce transaction costs of the Government and development partners, improve \ncoordination  between  all  parties,  and  strengthen  the  participation  of  MOPME,  DPE,  and \nstakeholders in other levels in primary education annual planning. This approach will therefore \nincrease organizational and financial efficiency for enhancing the quality of and access to \nprimary education in a holistic and balanced manner. \n \n67.  A balanced, holistic focus is necessary since the past 15 years has seen rapid growth in \nenrollment ratios, and strong overall quantitative growth in primary education as a whole. PEDP \nII will promote a balanced development focus by providing resources particularly for improving \nthe quality of primary education and access to it, by: (i) increasing the completion rate;  (ii) \nimproving the enrollment ratio for girls and children from poor families; (iii) addressing the needs \nof the disadvantaged, indigenous, and refugee children, and design specific targeted strategies \nfor equitable enrollment, completion, and attainment;  (iv) improving the quality of teacher \ntraining at the PTIs, subcluster level, and in URCs increasing facilities for head teacher training; \n(v) increasing training opportunities for teachers from the RNGPS; (vi) recruiting of teachers, \nespecially  female  teachers;  (vii)  introducing  instruments  and  methods  for  classroom \nperformance and achievement; (viii) strengthening field-level monitoring; (ix) providing adequate \ninfrastructure, sanitation, and water facilities for schools; (x) improving delivery of textbooks and \nadequate learning materials;  (xi) strengthening the resource base of URCs, where emphasis is \non Masters degrees or Bachelor degrees in education and teaching experience for instructors \nand AEOs; (xii) strengthening social mobilization and social development activities to increase \nenrollment  and  retention  ratio  for  children  from  poor  households;  (xiii)  restructuring  and \nstrengthening SMCs and Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) for their active participation in \nschool  management  and  planning;  (xiv)  increasing  accountability  of  the  school  system  to \nparents and the community; (xv) establishing education committees at the local government \nlevel (Union Parishad and Upazila level).   \n \n68.  The noted measures, particularly (ii), (iii), and (xii), will improve access to primary \neducation by the poor, disadvantaged, and indigenous people, and will therefore enhance their \n ", "20  \nbasic  competencies  and  chances  for  secondary  school  education/vocational  training  and \nemployment opportunities. While Bangladesh is a largely monoculture society, there is an \nindigenous people population living largely in CHT and in parts of Sylhet and in northern \nBangladesh.  Priority  in  access  to  education  will  be  given  to  remote  areas;  underserved, \nunderschooled areas of CHT; and districts with indigenous people. Poor children are often \nforced to work as child laborers in hazardous and exploitative forms of employment. With \nsupport from PEDP II, these children will be provided with opportunity for primary education. In \naddition,  the  targeting  of  poor  children  will  also  be  addressed  through  the  Government\u2019s \nextensive stipend program, which has been designed to benefit poor children in particular. A \npoverty impact assessment was undertaken to assess (i) the degree to which the existing \nProgram (PEDP I) targets poverty and achieves poverty impact; and (ii) the degree to which \nPEDP II is expected to improve poverty targeting and the additional poverty impact that is \nexpected from its implementation. By the end of PEDP II, enrolment of poor children is expected \nto increase by 2.7 million to 3.2 million, and 67\u201376% of total PEDP II expenditure (compared \nwith 55% in FY2001/02) is expected to have been targeted to the poor. Details of the poverty \nimpact analysis are in Appendix 11.  \n \n69.  Significant progress has been made in gender parity in enrollment; PEDP II will now \nemphasize improving completion rates, which are low for both boys and girls. To ensure \nprogress in meeting the government quota of 60% female teachers, the proportion of female \nteachers is planned to reach 50% during PEDP II from the current proportion of 38%. Gender \nequality training will be included in the subcluster and PTI training. To enhance gender equality \nin planning and implementing of PEDP II, linkages will be made with the Ministry of Women and \nChildren Affairs at national and local levels.  \n \n70.  Overall, the estimated immediate beneficiaries of PEDP II are (i) about 16 million pupils \nin about 65,000 primary schools under the MOPME (ii) 35,000 new primary school teachers \nwho will receive initial training and (iii) all 40,000 existing untrained primary school teachers who \nwill receive initial training. In addition, the target group of in-service training includes all 320,000 \nexisting trained primary school teachers and head teachers, including primary school teachers \nin schools under MOE administration, who will receive in-service training through several stages \nduring PEDP II. Over 17 million pupils in about 78,000 primary schools will benefit from the in-\nservice training of their teachers. \n \nB.  Risk Analysis \n71.  The design and implementation plan of PEDP II draw heavily from lessons learned from \nprevious  interventions  in  primary  education  in  Bangladesh,  and  also  more  widely  from \nexperiences from implementing sectorwide approach modality in Bangladesh and the region. To \navoid the risks and problems associated with coordination and implementation of numerous \nseparate project interventions, and the consequent lack of impact  of such interventions on \nquality improvement, PEDP II has been designed to have a holistic focus\u2014acknowledging that \nimproved  quality  at  the  classroom  level  cannot  be  achieved  without  improvement  at  the \nsystemic  level.  Implementing  a  sectorwide  program  approach  as  in  PEDP  II  also  entails \nsignificant risks. The risks have been analyzed, and a detailed risk mitigation plan has been \ndeveloped.  Organizational  development,  institutional  reform,  and  capacity  building  will  be \nsupported for efficient implementation  of the program approach, based on a comprehensive \npolicy and institutional reform matrix agreed to by all parties for PEDP II. While the Government \nis committed to a sectorwide program approach, there is a risk that a future Government could \nreverse policy decision on this commitment. However, this risk is not considered high, since the \nsectorwide  approach  and  program  modalities  are  very  much  linked  with  wider  long-term \ndevelopment frameworks of Bangladesh, such as the national poverty reduction strategy, and \n ", "        21\nthe MTEF. These have been agreed upon at high international forums and are being monitored \nregularly through an international consultative process. \n \n72.  There is also a risk that the Government may not be able to allocate adequate financial \nresources for the Program. Therefore, as part of the risk analysis and preparation of the \nfinancial plan, financial sustainability was assessed by (i) reviewing the general adequacy of the \nrevenue expenditure budget allocation to support the recurrent cost of delivering public primary \neducation services, and (ii) analyzing the recurring cost implications of PEDP II investments. \nThe cost of the Government\u2019s stipend program is included as a recurring cost, given its policy \nimplications and its recurring nature. Two scenarios have been developed to determine the level \nof revenue expenditure budget that will be required to support primary education after PEDP II \n\u2014a base case scenario and a high-growth scenario.  Based on broad assumptions, it is \nestimated  that  an  increase  of  83% in the FY2002/03 revenue expenditure budget will be \nrequired by FY2008/09 to adequately cover the recurring costs of existing public primary \neducation programs and the recurring cost implications of PEDP II investments. Compared with \nthe existing level of recurrent expenditures paid from the revenue expenditure budget and the \ndevelopment budget, i.e., as incurred in FY2002/03 (according to Government estimates), this \nrepresents a real increase of only 6%. Therefore, while apparently substantial, this increase \ncould be phased in by the end of PEDP II, primarily through a shift from the development budget \nto the revenue expenditure budget. Details of the analysis are in Supplementary Appendix T. \n \n73.  Also, the possibility of corruption and financial mismanagement has been addressed. \nThe approved PEDP II policy and institutional reform framework include measures to ensure \nbetter  governance,  efficiency  in  system  performance,  and  transparency  in  financial \nmanagement and procurement. Public expenditure tracking surveys will be undertaken. An \naction plan for addressing the financial irregularities in the sub-sector will be implemented.   \nProgram\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed, and no significant adverse impacts were \nidentified.  However,  environmental  considerations  will  be  incorporated  to  avoid  significant \nenvironmental impacts, such as those from water contaminated with arsenic, sanitation facilities, \nand construction of classrooms.  \n \n74.  An overall risk management strategy matrix for PEDP II has been prepared, where \ncritical sector policy issues are identified and prioritized. For each critical sector policy issue, a \nstrategy and action plan was prepared for actions to be completed before implementation and \nactions to be implemented as an integral part of PEDP II. The matrix will be updated as required \nand used during joint reviews or dialogues between the Government and development partners. \nThe matrix is presented in Supplementary Appendix U. \n \nV.

The report and recommendation of the President (RRP) has briefly outlined demand-\nside, supply-side and institutional constraints to achieving quality primary education for all \nchildren in Bangladesh. These constraints summarize the major issues and challenges that face \nBangladesh as it seeks to meet the Education for All (EFA) agenda by 2015. The following \ndiscussion examines these issues, focusing on the challenges facing the Government over the \nnext 5\u201315 years.  \n \nA.  The Quality Challenge \n \n2.  Bangladesh,  like  many  developing  countries,  has  made  considerable  progress  in \nensuring that all children have access to primary education through the formal system. Indeed, \nthe data suggest that more than 90% of children do attend primary school for some period of \ntime, although the percentage actually completing all primary grades is much lower - probably \nclose to 50% - although the official data indicate 67% completion. Completion, like participation, \nis linked to cost and poverty, but it is, at least in part and increasingly as systems and \neconomies develop, linked to the perceived quality of the education that children receive. \nParents faced with serious poverty constraints do not wish to use scarce resources on an \nineffective education that cannot deliver appropriate rewards to the next generation. \n \n3.  Many factors contribute to this real and perceived lack of quality. These include the \nemployment of untrained teachers, the shift or staggered system with its comparatively short \nschool contact hours, lack of support materials for teacher and student use (especially the lack \nof supplementary reading materials), lack of motivated teachers, a poor physical environment \nfor learning, etc. There is compelling evidence1 to support these perceptions.  \n \n(i)  At  least  20,000  teachers  in  government  primary  schools  (about  16%)  were \nuntrained  as  of  November  2002,  while  the  majority  of  those  who  have  a \nCertificate in Education (C. in Ed.) are, at best, poorly trained. The situation in the \nsatellite, registered nongovernment primary schools (RNGPS) and other schools \nwithin the formal sector is even worse. \n \n(ii)  There is a general lack of teaching and learning materials except  textbooks and \nchalkboards.  As  a  result,  the  resource  environment  in  which  teachers  and \nstudents teach and learn is impoverished, reinforcing a reliance on memory- \noriented learning in classes dominated by teacher-directed activity, instead of a \nshift toward student-centered and activity-based methods that would support the \ncompetency-based curriculum. \n \n(iii)  Teachers  are  poorly  paid  and  go  unrewarded  for  the  attainment  of  higher \nqualifications and increased responsibility, and, as a result, lack motivation to \nimprove. This low level of motivation reveals itself in lack of punctuality and a \nhigh level of absenteeism. \n \n(iv)  By international standards the official school attendance hours are much lower \nthan necessary for effective learning (Table A2). But evidence derived through \nmonitoring studies suggests that the official figures are well in excess of the real \n                                                 \n1  Unless otherwise indicated, data are from official education management information system (EMIS) supplied \n  through the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE). ", "30 Appendix 2 \nsituation. Teacher and student absenteeism and laxity in school management \nmean that actual contact hours are probably at least 30% below the levels \nsuggested by official statistics. \n \nTable A2: Primary Education Cycle: Length of Studies and \n    Total Class Hours for Selected Countries \n \n  Years of  Average Class  Total \n  Primary  Hours Per  Class \nCountry  Education  Year  Hours \nAustralia  6  1,000  6,000 \nBangladesh  5  768  3,840 \nBelgium  6  850  5,096 \nCanada  6  1,000  6,000 \nEgypt  5  908  4,539 \nIndonesia  6  875  5,244 \nMalaysia  6  933  5,597 \nPhilippines  6  1,144  6,865 \nSingapore  6  906  5,434 \nSri Lanka  5  874  4,370 \nVietnam  5  840  4,200 \nInternational Average (67 Countries)  5.9  910  5,367 \n  Source:  Second Primary Education Development Program (PEDP II) Macro Plan. January 2003. Dhaka \n \n4.  The impact of these highly negative factors is clearly shown in the low completion rates \nand even more so in the extremely low pass rate (5%) in the annual grade 5 scholarship \nexaminations. Qualitative reports and other research2 suggest that many children\u2014perhaps the \nmajority and even those \u201csuccessfully\u201d completing class 5\u2014do not attain acceptable standards \nof literacy and numeracy, and many lapse into illiteracy once they leave school.  \n \n5.  Added to these factors that impact directly on the child at school, are other forces that \nwork against quality improvement on a national scale. These latter forces include the following:  \n \n(i)  socioeconomic environment that favors the more economically well-off urban \nclasses and disadvantages the poor and those handicapped through physical \nand intellectual impairments; \n(ii)  diversity of schooling within the formal sector, making it more difficult to adopt \nand institutionalize better classroom practices across the whole primary school \nspectrum; \n(iii)  competition from the nonformal sector that supports, albeit inadvertently, the \ndecisions of parents to take their children away from the formal sector and put \nthem into employment in the knowledge that their children will be able to achieve \nliteracy and numeracy and graduate at primary level at a nonformal center run by \none or other nongovernment organization; and \n(iv)  generally  weak  organizational  and  institutional  framework  and  structure  for \ndelivery of primary education. \n \n6.  So, while the challenge to improve the quality of primary education is great in itself, the \nchallenge to overcome the other contributing negative forces is equally so.  \n \n                                                 \n2  For example: Literacy Profiles of Primary School Children in Bangladesh \u2013 Draft Report. ESTEEM. August 2002. ", "    Appendix 2  31\nB.  The Socioeconomic or \u201cInclusive Education\u201d Challenge \n \n7.  The issue of poverty has been dealt with in great detail within the Government\u2019s Second \nPrimary Education Development Program (PEDP II) Macro Plan. With at least 40% of the \npopulation on or below the established poverty line with household income no greater than $1 \nper day, and perhaps another 30% living on no more than $2 per day, the Government has \nmoved to provide substantial income support through the Primary Education Stipend Program \n(supplementary appendix F) within the PEDP II framework. With payments based on attendance \nand satisfactory performance, it can be expected that this program will strongly encourage \ngreater numbers of children from the poorest families to attend and complete school. The \nselection criteria initially targeted the poorest 40% of the enrolled students in rural primary \nschools. Since then the coverage has been extended to also cover urban schools. \n  \n8.  Other disadvantaged groups underrepresented in primary schooling include the urban \nslum  dwellers  (particularly  squatters),  the  geographically  isolated  communities,  disabled \nchildren, and child workers. Contemporary studies also show that tribal children in Bangladesh \ncontinue to experience higher incidences of poverty, illiteracy, dropout rates, and disease than \nthe national averages. These are partly the result of years of conflict, but they also represent the \nresult of ongoing ethnic discrimination that places insufficient value on tribal languages and \ntraditions in learning.  \n \n9.  Clearly, in the context of the Government\u2019s goal of EFA and the specific PEDP II goals, \nthe challenge of providing an \u201cinclusive education\u201d that pays more than lipservice to the \u201call\u201d \naspect of EFA is very important. Full mainstreaming of all primary education age children into \nformal primary education cannot be expected or demanded within the next 5 years. But changes \nthat can lead to full mainstreaming in the future need to be started as soon as possible. To \nimprove quality without meeting the challenge of ensuring that \u201call\u201d children are included within \nthe ambit of formal primary education will reduce the impact of universal primary education in \nhelping to eliminate the socioeconomic divisions and disparities within the population, and will \nundermine the Government\u2019s credibility on a most serious social issue.  \n \nC.  The Systemic Challenge \n \n10.  As in many, if not all developing countries, most of the problems confronting primary \neducational  improvement  are  created  and  magnified  by  organizational  and  institutional \nweaknesses. In part, these weaknesses are the result of the rapid growth of the educational \nsystem while the organizational and institutional framework of structures, rules, and processes \nchange far more slowly. In part, they are the result of weak planning, vested interest inertia, and \nactive opposition to change. \n \n11.  Specifically,  the  traditional  centralized  bureaucracy  based  on  a  well-educated \nadministrative cadre that has no specific expertise in primary education is a major handicap \nwhen channeling resources to areas and activities that have not been traditionally supported. \nThe lack of supplementary teaching and learning materials, and the focus on traditional teaching \nmethods more suited to past curricula are examples of how difficult it is to convince policy \nmakers and system bureaucrats to promote and fund such \u201cinnovations.\u201d The tendency for \nadministrators  and  bureaucrats  to  regard  primary  education  as  of  lesser  importance  and \ndemanding less skill and lower qualifications than secondary and postsecondary education, \ndespite  the  political  rhetoric  to  the  contrary,  adds  to  this  indisposition  to  change  and \nimprovement. At a time when pressure on scarce financial resources is ever increasing primary ", "32 Appendix 2 \neducation loses because no people at the upper echelons are willing to promote its cause and \nneeds. \n \n12.  Even within the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) there is lack of primary teaching \nexpertise  within  a  structure  that  has  left  some  important  functions  such  as  finance  and \nprocurement  and  Education  Management  Information  Systems  (EMIS)  without  proper \norganizational homes and nearly all functions are in the hands of people who lack the essential \nskills  to  meet  the  demands  of  their  posts.  The  slow  development  of  effective  EMIS  and \nmonitoring and evaluation functions means absence of  base data on which to pin effective \ndecision making. This makes overall systemic change slow and difficult.  \n \n13.  The education offices at division, district and Upazila levels are also suffering through  \nlack of human and financial resources. At a time when the Government is promoting the \nstrategy of decentralization and devolution, the lack of resources at those levels is a serious \nomission and contradiction. Without the resources to implement, and with final authority for \ndecision making clearly centered in Dhaka, the opportunity for regional offices to develop local \nsolutions to local problems is extremely limited.  \n \nD.  Meeting the Challenges \n \n14.  The PEDP II recognizes these challenges and provides strategies to meet them. These \nstrategies include the following: \n \n(i)  adoption of a \u201cquality standards\u201d approach that will guarantee every primary \nschool a basic level and quality of inputs irrespective of location; \n(ii)  coordinated, integrated and comprehensive subsector strategy that creates the \nbasis for quality improvement at all levels and in all aspects of the primary \neducation  sector.  Organizational  capacity  building,  quality  improvement  in \nteaching  and  learning,  improved  infrastructure  and  facilities,  and  inclusive \neducation are all supported by the PEDP II. The synergies between elements are \nused to create strength and improvement in all; \n(iii)  capacity development through improved recruitment and training for all personnel \nwhether administrators or teachers; and  \n(iv)  decentralization  and  devolution  of  appropriate  authority,  responsibility  and \ndecision making to Upazila, school, and community levels, to promote faster \nresponse and local solutions to problems and issues.

Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?         Yes \n \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in developing member country (DMC):  \nBangladesh is a signatory to the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) 1990, which adopted the World \nDeclaration on Education for All (EFA) by the year 2000 and agreed on the basic Framework for Action to Meet \nBasic Learning Needs. Bangladesh has shown a strong national commitment to education and has one of the \nlargest primary education systems in the world. In the Government\u2019s poverty reduction statement, three broad \ndimensions of human poverty\u2014deprivation in health, education, and nutrition\u2014are used as indicators for poverty. \nThe Government of Bangladesh recognizes primary school education as a key area for investment and \ndevelopment as a means for reducing poverty and improving the quality of life for children in Bangladesh. The \npast 15 years have seen rapid growth in participation and completion rates and strong overall growth in the \nsystem of primary education as a whole. Progress has been made in improving school facilities, training and \ncurriculum  revision,  and  provision  of  textbooks.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  gender  parity  in \nenrollment. The 2001 school year data show that 17.7 million students were enrolled in over 78,000 primary level \ninstitutions, taught by more than 320,000 teachers. This number represented a 30.8% increase over the \nenrollment level in 1991. The gross enrollment ratio (GER) reached 97.5% in 2001 and may be slightly higher \nthan that level for girls. However, preliminary data for 2002 suggests that enrollment has declined by 1.5% from \n2001. The net enrollment ratio (NER) is closer to 75%.  \nThe experience of the first Primary Education Development Program (PEDP I) is not just one of success. The \nfindings of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Primary School Performance Monitoring Project (PSPMP), \nassessment of first Primary Education Development Program (PEDP I) and field observations indicate the \nfollowing: (i) Higher rate of dropouts, averaging 33%, results partly from poverty of many families; (ii) Rate of \nattendance of students (61%) is low; (iii) Primary school completion rate is estimated at 67% indicating many \nchildren do not receive full primary education; (iv) Children from poor working class, tribal, refugee, and disabled \nchildren are marginalized in the formal education system; (v) Pupil-to-teacher ratio, which is about 55:1, is high; \n(vi) The number of contact hours between students and teachers is low, absenteeism is high and teachers come \nlate to work; (vii) There is lack of quality teacher\u2019s training at the primary education teacher training institutes \n(PTIs) and subcluster level; (viii) Teachers from nonregistered and other categories of school receive little \ntraining; (ix) There are fewer female than male teachers in government primary schools (42%) and even fewer \n(26%) in registered nongovernment primary school (RNGPS); (x) Field-level monitoring is limited to easily \naccessible schools and a weak monitoring system; (xi) Textbooks are not available on time and teaching aids are \ninsufficient; (xii) Classrooms are scarce and  toilet facilities inadequate; and (xiii) School management committee \n(SMC) and parent and teachers\u2019 association (PTA) are dysfunctional. \nIn the design of Second Primary Education Development Program (PEDP II) emphasis is on improving the quality \nof education and access to education for the government primary school (GPS), RNGPS, and community \nschools. The PEDP II will focus on (i) increasing the completion rate of primary education; (ii) retaining the \nenrollment rate for children from the poor families and girls, (ii) addressing the needs of the disadvantaged, tribal, \nand  refugee  children,  and  design  specific  targeted  strategies  for  equitable  enrollment,  completion,  and \nattainment; (iii) improving the quality of teachers\u2019 training at the PTI and subcluster level, increasing facilities for \nhead teacher training; (iv) increasing training opportunities for teachers from RNGPS; (v) recruiting of teachers, \nespecially female teachers; (vi) integrating recommendations of ADB\u2019s PSPMP for quality; (vii) introducing \ninstruments  and  methods  developed  by  PSPMP  for  assessing  baseline  classroom  performance  and \nachievement; (viii) strengthening field-level monitoring, (ix) providing adequate infrastructure, sanitation, and \nwater facilities for schools; (x) improving delivery of textbooks and adequate learning materials; (xi) strengthening \nthe resource base of Upazila Resource Center (URC); the instructor and the assistant education officer (AEO) \nshould have M. Ed or B. Ed degree; (xii) strengthening social mobilization activities for increased enrollment and \nretention rate for children from poor households; (xiii) restructuring and strengthening SMC and PTA for their \nactive participation in school management and planning; (xiv) increasing accountability of the school system to \nthe parents and the community; and (xv) establishing an education committee at local levels (Union Parishad and \nUpazila level). Under the PEDP II, policy dialogue will be initiated to address equity issues: access to primary \neducation by all children, textbooks distributed to all children, learning materials provided to teachers, and quality \nimprovements in all schools in the primary education sector.  \nBasic education enables a person to function adequately in one\u2019s physical and social environment. Primary \neducation  is  the  most  important  component  of  basic  education,  which  enables  children  to  acquire  basic \ncompetencies and life skills at an early age. Education improves the life chances of young persons with regard to ", "    Appendix 5  45\nemployment  opportunities\u2014particularly  for  girls\u2014and  it  improves  their  knowledge  and  decision-making \ncapacities. Educating girls would delay marriages and lower fertility rates. Access to primary education by poor, \ndisadvantaged, tribal, and refugee children would enhance their basic competencies and chances for secondary \nschool education/vocational training and employment opportunities. Poor children are forced to work as child \nlaborers in hazardous and exploitative forms of employment. These children will be provided with opportunity for \nprimary education.   \n  \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nBangladesh, with a population of 132 million and per capita gross national product at $350, is one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. However, estimates based on the household expenditure survey (HES) indicate that \nincidence of income poverty has declined from over 70% of the population in 1973 to an estimated 36% in 2001. \nProgress has been made in improving Bangladesh\u2019s human poverty index. Between 1992 and 1998 the index \nincreased by 49%, with marked improvements in life expectancy, adult literacy, gross primary school enrollment \nratio, and decreases in infant mortality rates, total fertility rates and dropout rates in primary schools. These \nresults were achieved by continued efforts of the Government and nongovernment organizations to expand the \ncoverage of essential services to the disadvantaged sections of society. In particular, the shift in public \nexpenditures  toward  social  sector  programming  in  the  1990s,  including  primary  education,  has  been  a \ncontributing factor. Yet, Bangladesh still faces severe deficiencies in the quality of health, nutrition and education. \nPoverty is cited by officials at all levels in the education system as the major barrier hindering progress toward \nuniversal access to education. Research by Education Watch in 1999 found that 23% of children were not \nenrolled in school, and among the enrolled children, 79% were poor. The study found that children from \neconomically disadvantaged families enroll in less numbers, attend less frequently, drop out more, and perform \nless. \nAn estimated 6.5 million children in Bangladesh between the ages of 5 and 14 (3.9 million boys and 2.6 million \ngirls) have little option but to work to support themselves and their families. The vast majority, 94%, are employed \nin the informal sector, mainly in rural Bangladesh. In urban settings, girls are employed as domestic laborers, \nwhile the boys work in small roadside stalls, shops, hotels, or as garbage collectors. Girls and boys both work in \nsmall factories. To provide poor children with access to education, Bangladesh has pursued strategies like the \nfood for education program and stipend program. Both of the programs have been instrumental to a certain extent \nin increasing enrollment of poor children. However, lack of social mobilization program for the parents, poverty, \nmethod and quality of teaching, lack of flexible school hours for poor children, low contact hours between teacher \nand children, etc., have kept the dropout rate of children from poor families significant. The present method of \nteaching and low contact hours provide little opportunity for the children to complete homework in the classroom. \nChildren from poor households are often busy with household chores and especially in the rural areas, children \nwork on family farms or as laborers after school hours. Lack of time, and facilities and the environment in poor \nhouseholds contribute to low performance in school among poor children. Poor performance also affects their \neligibility for stipends. The PEDP II will develop an appropriate social mobilization strategy for the parents and in \nthe community to reduce the dropout rate of poor children. Increased contact hours between students and \nteachers will allow students to complete their homework in the classroom. During implementation, the PEDP II will \ndevelop specific measures, and strategies, and target to address social and economic constraints faced by the \npoor, disadvantaged/disabled, tribal, religious minority, and refugee children. In access to education, priority will \nbe given to remote areas with ethnic minorities. The monitoring indicators will be developed to address \nconstraints and measure changes in the status of access and quality of education by poor, disadvantage, and \ntribal and refugee children. Many of the poor children are enrolled in RNGPS, the PEDP II will put specific \nemphasis and resources to improve the RNGPS.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \nThe plan of PEDP II was prepared in discussion with various stakeholders such as the government, training \ninstitutes, school management, teachers, and development partners. \nTo enhance the participation of parents and the community during implementation of PEDP II, emphasis will be \non  capacity  building  and  active  involvement  of  the  Parent  Teacher  Association  (PTA)  and  the  School \nManagement Committee (SMC) in school management and planning. In addition, the role of local government \n(Union Parishad) in the local-level education system will be strengthened by forming an education committee at \nthe Union Parishad level. At present the functions of SMC and PTA are limited to occasional meetings. The roles \nof these committees are not properly understood and or accepted in the school management system. The PEDP \nII will restructure and strengthen the SMC and PTA to increase accountability of teachers, to improve attendance \nand lower the dropout rate. ", "46 Appendix 5 \nThe PEDP II will emphasize social mobilization activities through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for active \ncommunity involvement to raise the enrollment and completion rates in primary education and promote the \nmaintenance of school facilities. The SMC will include the following as members of the committee: mother as well \nas  father  as  representatives  of  parents,  and  female  representatives  of  the  union  council/municipality, \nrepresentatives from NGO/civil society. The role, responsibility, and reporting system of SMC will be clearly \ndefined. Similarly the role and responsibility of the PTA will be defined and the PTA will be strengthened through \ntraining and social mobilization activities. PTA meetings in neighborhoods and mothers\u2019 meetings will foster active \nparticipation of parents in the PTA. The Union Parishad level education committee will consist of members of the \nUnion Parishad, representatives from the SMC, PTA, teachers and NGO/civil society. The local level education \ncommittee will coordinate its work with SMC in union-level planning and management of the school system. The \nexperience of the community contributing to the school maintenance fund under PEDP I will be replicated in the \nPEDP II. The partnership among the parents, community, local government, and education system will receive \nmore emphasis in PEDP II.  \n \nD.

Significant progress has been  prepared. \nmade in enrollment of girls in primary education. Net \nenrollment ratio in 1998 were 80.0% for boys and 82.9% \nfor  girls.  Completion  rates  in  primary  education  are \nhigher for girls at 69% compared with 66% for boys. This \nis a significant achievement compared with other South \nAsian countries. The goal to increase the proportion of \nwomen teacher (60%) at the primary level has met some \nsuccess.  Education statistics of the Primary Education \nDirectorate (DPE) in Bangladesh indicates 33.9% female \nteachers in primary education in 2000.1 \nThe PEDP II will emphasize on improving the quality of \neducation as shown by increased completion rate in \nprimary school for both boys and girls, with specific focus \non  children  from  poor  households.  The  existing          \ngender-disaggregated  monitoring  system  should  be \nstrengthened  with  more  quantitative  and  qualitative \nindicators. In addition, monitoring indicators for girls and \nboys  from  different  socioeconomic  classes  will  be \nincluded in the system.  \nTo fill up the government recommended 60% quota of \nfemale teachers, proportion of female teachers should \nreach to 50% during the life cycle of PEDP II. In cases \nwhere female teachers are not available in the respective \nUpazila, provision will be made to recruit female teachers \nfrom the neighboring Upazila. Among the criteria for \nregistration, a nongovernment school should have 2 \nfemale teachers out of 4 teachers. \nThe initiative of National Curriculum and Textbook Board \n(NCTB)  on  gender  audit  and  gender-sensitive  text \nmaterials will be supported under the PEDP II and the \n                                                                 \n1  For detailed gender-related data, please refer to PEDP II Macro Plan, January 2003.

Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Rationale for Intervention \n \n1.  Primary-level  education  is  universally  regarded  as  a  public  good,  with  significant \nexternalities that may not be adequately recognized and provided for by the private sector. \nEnhanced primary education is strongly correlated with economic development and increased \nproductivity. The main economic arguments follow. \n \n(i)  Social and private returns. There are high social and private returns to investing in \nprimary education\u2014cost-benefit analyses of primary school education consistently \ndemonstrate very high rates of return. Moreover, enhanced primary education is \nstrongly  correlated  with  economic  development  and  increased  productivity.  By \nproviding  the  children  of  Bangladesh  with  enhanced  primary  school  education, \nSecond Primary Development Program (PEDP II), will put them on the road toward \nbetter  employment  and  improved  income-earning  possibilities.  Achieving  an \nenhanced level of education and literacy will clearly be a significant factor in breaking \nthe cycle of poverty in the rural areas of Bangladesh. Without PEDP II, the majority \nof the labor force will continue to lack quality basic education, which is critical to \nenhancing productive skill levels and raising labor efficiency and productivity rates.  \n(ii)  Equity. Primary education spending in Bangladesh is pro-poor and the Government \nhas an important role to play in continuing to ensure that access to education\u2014 \nespecially education of high quality\u2014is equitable. PEDP II interventions, such as the \ntargeted stipend program, and funds to community-based organizations, private and \nother groups, are aimed at equitability. \n(iii)  Relationship  with  higher  levels  of  education. The Interim Poverty Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (IPRSP)  recognizes  that  the  unsatisfactory performance of the \nprimary education system has a ripple effect as it contributes to a significant loss in \nsystemic efficiency. The outputs of a poor quality primary education system proceed \nto the secondary level and higher education levels, and ultimately lead to diminished \nreturns to employability and productivity. PEDP II aims to enhance the quality of the \nthroughout of the primary education system.  \n(iv)  Information. Currently, there is no systematic monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of \nthe  primary  education  system.  The  Government  has  a  crucial  role  to  play  in \ncollecting,  analyzing,  and  disseminating  of  information  on  the  quality  and \neffectiveness  of  education  provided  in  different  institutions;  in  analyzing  how \nefficiently public versus private sector funds flow through the system and ultimately \nreach teachers and schools, and in determining how those resources are combined \nwith other inputs at the school level to generate education outcomes.  By putting \neffective M&E mechanisms in place, PEDP II will ensure that such information is \nreadily available and can feed back into policy development. ", "58   Appendix 11 \n2.  Rationale for SWAPS \n \n2.  Sectorwide approaches (SWAPS)1 are mechanisms by which development agencies \n(multilateral and bilateral) collaborate to support sector reform programs based on a country\u2019s \nlong-term  vision  for  its  development.  SWAPS  are  sometimes  known  as  sector/subsector \nprograms or sector investment programs or sector investment programs. SWAPS are used to \nsupport discrete subsectors, i.e., primary education2 or defined subsectors (geographic regions \nor subnational entities). They have evolved as a means for improving development cooperation \nin the sectoral context, and they aim to (i) strengthen government ownership, and management \nand coordination of sector activities; (ii) facilitate integration of capital investment budgets in the \noverall  country  budget,  and  the  budgeting  of  sufficient  funds  to  cover  operating  costs;             \n(iii) support the improved performance of government institutions in managing sector resources; \nand (iv) reduce the burden and cost of parallel management structures and the procedural \ndiversity of multiple externally funded activities.  \n \n3.  One of the defining features of SWAPS is the pooling of government and aid funds for \ndisbursement through jointly agreed-upon channels, with aid agencies participating in the pool \nto finance agreed-upon proportions of the overall sector program. This arrangement yields \nseveral benefits:  (i) enables institution of a single procurement, financial management, and \ndisbursement system; (ii) reduces the transaction costs of parallel systems; and (iii) enhances \nthe government\u2019s own fiduciary system.  \n \n4.  In light of the difficulties encountered during Primary Education Development Program \n(PEDP  I)  (numerous,  generally  poorly  performing,  weakly  managed,  low  disbursing  and \noverlapping aid-financed projects), the Government has committed to implement PEDP II as a \nsubsector  approach,  whereby  partners  will  jointly  support  Ministry  of  Primary  and  Mass \nEducation (MOPME\u2019s) subsector program in primary education. Development partners in the \nsector  strongly  support  the  Government  in  adopting  this  approach.  Therefore  while  the \napproach has downsides and risks, the overriding view is that the benefits of bringing together \nthe government and all major partners and stakeholders under a common framework will result \nin better support: (i) government-led and -managed sector development; (ii) a comprehensive \nsector policy reform framework; (iii) rationalized sector targets that are appropriately integrated \ninto  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  framework;  and  (iv)  more  cost-effective \nutilization of available sector resources. \n \n3.  Cost Benefit Analysis \n \n5.  The PEDP II is designed to improve access, especially to full 5-year program for primary \nschools, and for the disadvantaged and children with special needs, as well as improve the \nquality and efficiency of the primary education subsector in Bangladesh. The four substantive \ncomponents contributing to these goals are (i) quality improvement through organizational \ndevelopment,  (ii)  quality  improvement  in  schools  and  classrooms,  (iii)  quality  improvement \nthrough infrastructure development, and (iv) improved access to quality schooling. Financial and \ntechnical resources are provided to ensure quality management, implementation and M&E of \nthe four components. \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2002. Fiduciary Arrangements for Sectorwide Approaches (SWAPS): Interim Guidelines to Staff, \nIssued by the Financial Management and Procurement Sector Boards.Washington, D.C. \n2  Ibid., p.2.   \n   ", "                          Appendix 11  59\n6.  Benefits Stream. PEDP II design focuses on quality improvements that will establish \nthe necessary foundation for a more efficient and effective primary education system. The \ninvestment will promote quality improvements in education, beneficiaries of which will be the \nincremental students entering the education system as well as those who are already in the \nprimary education stream. Quality improvements will include a lower student-teacher ratio, more \ntextbooks  and  supplemental  materials,  better  physical  facilities,  and  more  student-teacher \ncontact hours for teaching and learning activities. Key improvements that will contribute to the \nsustainable development of better quality primary education include the development of high-\nquality initial and in-service training programs for teachers and head teachers which will ensure \ngreater  use  of  classroom  practices  that  are  appropriate  for  teaching  and  learning  basic \ncompetencies, especially literacy and numeracy, and other foundation concepts that underpin \nlearning in everyday life and in secondary and higher education. The provision of necessary \nadditional teaching and learning resources will ensure that every school has the basic tools and \naids  to  support  the  new  methodologies.  However,  none  of  these  improvements  will  be \nsustainable unless and until system capacity and efficiency are enhanced. PEDP II will meet \nthis need through improved human resource development (HRD) strategies and the provision of \nadditional financial and other resources. Ensuring that these improvements go beyond the \nurban areas to the furthest regions of Bangladesh will assist in overcoming the barriers caused \nby remoteness and geography.   \n \n7.  Economic benefits are estimated in accordance with the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  Population growth rates, based on World Bank projections3, will be 1.22% for 2002-\n2008, 1.09% for 2009-2015, and 1.38 % for 2016-2020. \n(ii)  Improved access to primary education is achieved for educationally disadvantaged \nchildren\u2014especially  children  of  minority  groups\u2014through  the  stipend  program, \nenhanced school facilities and resources, and improved classroom resources and \nteaching, i.e.,  \n(a) The defined gross enrollment rate (GER) target of 106% for primary schooling is \nachieved by 2009. \n(b) The defined net enrollment rate (NER) target of 88% for primary schooling is \nachieved by 2009.4 \n(c) Repetition rates are reduced by at least 20% by 2009 over 2001-2002 baseline \nfigures. \n(d) Dropout rates are reduced by about 45%, from 33 % in 2001-2002 to 18% in \n2009. \n(iii)  Incremental earnings benefits are calculated on the basis of increased earnings with \neach additional year of primary schooling.   \n(iv)  The overall increase in enrollment will be due partially to the stipend program. It is, \nhowever, not possible to disaggregate the proportion of students who will receive \nstipends as a result of PEDP II.   \n(v)  Quality  improvements  include  reduced  student-teacher  ratios,  improvements  in \nteaching  due  to  increased  teacher  training,  more  textbooks  and  supplementary \nmaterials,  better  physical  facilities,  and  more  student-teacher  contact  hours  for \nteaching and learning activities. Given the data limitations, a proxy was developed to \ncapture the overall benefits expected to arise from quality improvements. The proxy \n                                                 \n3   www.http:\\sima\\EdStats\\td6.asp. \n4  NER is a more effective targeting measure for Bangladesh where the GER is already close to 100%. It can be \nexpected to increase for some years, but as the NER approaches 100% then the GER will also fall back towards \nparity with the NER. \n ", "60   Appendix 11 \nassumes that the targeted increase in contact hours will have a proportional impact \non  the  real  wage  rate  that  each  student  can  realize  for  each  year  of  primary \nschooling completed. \n \n8.  Cost  Stream.  The  estimated  direct  costs  of  the  PEDP  II  comprise  the  project \ninvestment, the public and private cost of each additional pupil-year, and the opportunity cost of \nretaining each student in school for an additional year. Public costs are estimated to be equal to \ngovernment  expenditure  for  each  pupil  attending  a  public  primary  school,  that  is,               \n$13.25 (Tk767), and private costs are those incurred by the each pupil's family on school fees, \nbooks and school supplies, transportation, etc., estimated at $17.75 (Tk1,028). The opportunity \ncost  of  retaining  each  student  in  school  for  an  additional  year  is  estimated  at  $226.36 \n(Tk13,106), that is equal to the minimum wage for an unskilled worker with no certificates for \nprimary school completion, adjusted for real growth in the wage rate equal to 2% annually. \n9.  NPV/EIRR. Based on the assumptions, PEDP II yields a net present value (NPV) of \n$1.22 billion assuming a discount rate of 12%, and an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n13.88%. See Table A11.1. \n \nTable A11.1. Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR) \nItem  Net Present Value \nBenefit Stream  $7.79 billion \nCost Stream  $6.75 billion \nNet Benefit Stream  $1.22 billion \nEIRR  13.88% \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.       \n10.  The EIRR is likely to be somewhat higher, reflecting positive externalities and longer-\nterm intergenerational social benefits that come with increased levels of education: lower fertility \nrates and improved health outcomes to which it is difficult to assign monetary values. In \naddition, the benefits are estimated for completion of the primary cycle only. No allowance is \nmade for the fact that improvements in primary education will enable more children to attend \nsecondary school and thereby have even greater earning power. In addition, it is assumed that \nthe children now enrolled in primary school, especially in the senior grades, will not benefit \nbecause they will have completed their primary education (or dropped out) before the full impact \nof the PEDP II is felt. \n4.    Sensitivity Analysis \n11.  A sensitivity analysis was based on alternative assumptions regarding the internal and \nexternal efficiency of the system. For the purpose of the analysis, (i) dropout and repetition rates \n(and hence completion rates) are used as proxies for measuring internal efficiency, and  (ii) \npotential wage growth rate is used as a proxy for measuring external efficiency. Table A11.2 \nhighlights the change in the rate of return under different assumptions. \n \nTable A11.2.  Sensitivity Analysis \nInternal  External Efficiency \nEfficiency  Low  Medium  High \nLow  6.08  13.67  20.41 \nMedium  6.12  13.88  20.69 \nHigh  6.39  14.16  21.05 \n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.       \n   ", "                          Appendix 11  61\n12.  \u201cLow\u201d internal efficiency assumes that the decrease in dropout and repetition rates \nachieved is 50% lower than that targeted, while \u201chigh\u201d assumes that the decrease in dropout \nand  repetition  rates  achieved  is  50%  greater  than  that  targeted.  Similarly,  \u201clow\u201d external \nefficiency assumes the increase in wage rate achieved is 50% lower than that estimated, while  \n\u201chigh\u201d external efficiency assumes the increase in wage rate achieved is 50% higher than that \nestimated. \n \n13.  The findings of the sensitivity analysis clearly indicate that the rates of return are highly \nsensitive to changes in assumptions regarding the external efficiency of the system. If changes \nin internal efficiency are held constant, a 50% change in external efficiency roughly corresponds \nto a 50% change in the rate of return. Whereas if changes in external efficiency are held \nconstant, a 50% change in internal efficiency corresponds to just a 2\u20133% change in the rate of \nreturn. \n \nB.    Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n14.  In Bangladesh, as elsewhere, the correlation between educational development and \nreduced incidence of poverty, improved in labor productivity, economic growth, and the quality \nof life is well recognized and obvious. Without strengthening the primary, and later, secondary \neducation, it will be virtually impossible for Bangladesh to halt the cycle of poverty. This is no \nsmall challenge. A large proportion of the population is so poor that the opportunity costs of \nsending a relatively young child to work create a considerable barrier to increasing the years of \nschool participation, increasing the rates of completion, and improving the quality of learning. \nYet, unless parents and the wider community recognize the relevance and benefits of primary \neducation, overcoming these barriers will be very difficult. Improving the quality of schooling is \ntherefore an essential step. Support mechanisms as the stipend program will help by targeting \nchildren for whom the opportunity costs of nonparticipation in primary schooling are high. By \nsupporting  increased  participation  and  completion,  the  stipend  program  will  negate  the \nopportunity cost. But economic growth and release from poverty will require far more than just \nattending school. The school experience itself must be worthwhile. \n \n15.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  acknowledges  the  primacy  of  the \neducational role in combating and overcoming poverty. By focusing on quality improvement\u2014\nspecially in the rural areas and across all elements of the primary education sector, from \nschools  to  supervision,  from  management  to  monitoring\u2014PEDP  II  translates  the  poverty \nreduction  strategy  into  action-oriented  interventions.  PEDP  II  and  external  support  for  its \nimplementation will hasten the process by which the population of Bangladesh can become a \nmore literate society, and by so doing provide a stronger foundation on which to build economic \ngrowth and future economic development. \n \n1.  Poverty Targeting 5, 6 \n \n16.  In Bangladesh, investment in primary education is generally considered strongly pro-\npoor\u201456% of all government subsidies on primary education benefit the poor, who represent \nroughly 50% of the total population. In addition, the higher proportion of poor among children of \nprimary school age more than offsets the lower  enrollment rates among the poor\u2014three of \nevery five children of primary school age come from poor households and almost half are from \n                                                 \n5  Government of Bangladesh. 2002.

Despite the impressive pro-poor targeting, there is considerable scope to improve the \npro-poor focus of government expenditures, even at the primary level. Public resources cover \nroughly half of education costs, but since private or household expenditure is less equitably \ndistributed relative to income than is public expenditure (as shown Table 3), the distribution of \ntotal expenditure in education across income quintiles is considerably less equitable than the \nbenefit incidence of public expenditure. Private education expenditures are lower among the \npoor, implying that poor children have access  to fewer school supplies and other learning \nmaterials, hampering their learning achievements. In addition, since much of private spending is \ndevoted to supplementary tutoring, which the poor are less able to afford, the result might be \ndirect discrimination by teachers against the poor and less able students since teachers rely on \ntutoring to supplement their income. Thus while it is not possible to ensure full equity in total \n(public and private) education expenditures between the poor and non-poor, improved targeting \nwill certainly reduce the inequitable distribution of education resources devoted to the poor.  \n \n18.  Stipend program. PEDP II supports improved pro-poor targeting of public education \nexpenditures through the stipend program. In August  2002 the Government of Bangladesh \napproved a plan to replace the Food for Education Program (FFE) with the stipend program to \ntarget poor families with primary school age children in rural areas. The stipend program was \nlaunched in September 2002 to enable poorer rural families, not only to enroll and to keep their \n   ", "                          Appendix 11  63\nchildren in school, but also to provide an incentive to children excluded by poverty to complete \ntheir primary schooling rather than work. \n \n19.  The  stipend  program  approved  by  the  Government  for  FY2002/03  amounts  to \napproximately $173 million, and will continue for the next 4 years under PEDP II. The selection \ncriteria7 are aimed at targeting the poorest 40% of enrolled students in primary schools in rural \nareas. Head teachers, in collaboration with their school management committees (SMC), will \nidentify the poorest 40% cohort of families who will then receive the stipend. Under the stipend \nprogram, approximately 5 million children attending government schools in rural Bangladesh will \neach receive Tk100\u2013125 a month. \n \n2.    Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n20.  It is currently estimated that 53.5% of enrolled students at the primary level who are \n\u201cpoor\u201d8 receive close to 55% of total public subsidies to primary education. Until last year, the \nFFE program was the main targeted poverty program for primary education, with an allocation \nof Tk4.61 billion, or about approximately 15% of the total primary education budget roughly \nestimated at Tk30 billion.9 Thus, if it is assumed that the directly targeted poverty subsidy is \nequal to 15%, then the indirectly targeted poverty subsidy is equal to the remaining 40%       \n(i.e., 55% minus 15%). \n \n21.  To estimate the incremental poverty impact of PEDP II, i.e., with the stipend, recognizing \nthat the stipend program replaces the FFE, two scenarios were evaluated. In the first scenario, it \nis assumed that the proportion of poor students remains constant over time (i.e., 53.5%) and the \nindirectly targeted proportion of education expenditures the poor received also remains constant \n(i.e., 40%). With PEDP II, assuming that the stipend program is well-targeted and there are no \nleakages in the system, the primary education program clearly becomes more pro-poor. By the \nend of PEDP II, close to 67% of public expenditures will be targeted to the poor. Moreover, \nwhile the system does not become more equitable in terms of access (due to the assumption of \na constant proportion of the poor in the program), total enrollments of the poor will rise to      \n11.2 million by the end of PEDP II from roughly 8.5 million in 2002. \n \n22.  In the second scenario, it is assumed that, as a result of the stipend program, more poor \nstudents are drawn into the primary education system, i.e., the proportion of the poor in the \nsystem rises from 53.5% in 2002 to 56% by the end of PEDP II\u2014with a proportional increase in \nnontargeted expenditures going to the poor. Under this scenario, 76% of public expenditures will \nbe spent on the poor, while enrollment of the poor will rise to about 11.7 million. With the stipend \nprogram, PEDP II will support enhanced equity in the primary education subsector.  \n                                                 \n7  The degree to which current criteria ensure that the stipend program in PEDP II reaches its intended target will be \nreviewed during PEDP II annual reviews. Two studies are currently being undertaken (i) assessment of the design \nand targeting of the primary education stipend program by drawing lessons from international experience on such \nprograms; and (ii) assessment of the relative impacts of the Food for Education Program and the recently \nimplemented primary education stipend program on outcomes at the student, household, school, and community \nlevels. Further studies in support of the review of the stipend program in PEDP II will be undertaken during PEDP II \nimplementation.  \n8  Based on working group calculation. \n9  Planning Commission. 2003.
