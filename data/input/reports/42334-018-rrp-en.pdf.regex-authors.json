THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Rural Roads Improvement \nProject (RRIP) III. \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate about 360 kilometers (km) of rural roads in five provinces \n(Kampong Cham, Kratie, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Tboung Khmum) to paved condition. The \nrehabilitated roads will provide poor rural provinces with a safer, disaster- and climate-resilient \nrural road network with all-year access to markets and other social services. This proposed project \nwill continue to support the sustainability of the rural road network through (i) a rural road \nmaintenance regime in the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD); and (ii) a community-based \nroad safety program. MRD has already established these initiatives through the earlier two \nprojects financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB): RRIP and RRIP II.1 The project will also \nsupport an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and prevention program (HHTPP). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector context. The principal mode of transport in Cambodia is by road. The road network \nof about 61,500 km includes (i) about 7,260 km of national roads (primary national highways), (ii) \nabout 9,000 km of provincial roads (secondary national highways), and (iii) about 45,200 km of \nrural roads. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport manages the national and provincial \nroads, while MRD manages the rural roads. \n \n4.  By the early 1990s, several years of civil war had severely deteriorated the country\u2019s road \nnetwork. Since 1992, with assistance from ADB and other multilateral and bilateral development \npartners, the government focused on rehabilitating the core national infrastructure required for \nthe economy to develop in a sustainable manner. As of 2017, development efforts over the past \n25 years have brought the paved national and provincial road network to about 8,526 km in length, \nor about 52.3% of the total national and provincial road network. \n \n5.  However, the rural road network needs further improvement as well. Only about 2,000 km, \nor 4.4% of rural roads have been paved as of 2017. Rural roads have a daily traffic volume of \nabout 200\u20133,000 passenger car units, and motorcycles and three-wheel vehicles account for \nmore than 80% of the traffic.2 The annual growth rate of the traffic volume is 4%\u20136% and is \nprojected to increase by 7%\u201312% by 2025, requiring more paved rural roads to accommodate \nfuture traffic.3 \n \n6.  About 80% of Cambodia\u2019s population reside in rural areas. Road user behavior accounts \nfor more than 90% of road crashes, and the risk of road crashes is higher on rural roads than on \nnational roads. Since better road surfaces may cause increased speeds that rural residents have \nnever experienced, lack of road safety education and near-zero enforcement in rural areas are \ncrucial issues when expanding the paved road network. Although the national crash fatality rate \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Kingdom \nof Cambodia for the Rural Roads Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 2670-CAM); and ADB. 2014. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Grants to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Rural Roads Improvement Project II. Manila (Loan 3151-CAM). \n2  ADB estimates in 2017. \n3  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nin Cambodia dropped in 2016 after steadily rising during 2004\u20132015, it is still high compared with \nother countries, underscoring the need for continuous road safety education and enforcement.4 \n \n7.  Because of rapid economic development and activity, overloading of cargo vehicles has \nbeen the major cause of road damage in Cambodia since 2007. This is also a significant issue \nfor rural roads because trucks that haul agricultural products and carry quarry materials for \nconstruction tend to be overloaded. \n \n8.  Cambodia experiences frequent flooding during the wet season, severely damaging most \nof  the  laterite  rural  roads  and  making  them  impassable.  Such  damage  causes  significant \nlivelihood losses for rural residents and entails repair costs. Thus, road design requires structural \nchanges to specifically deal with disaster risk and adapt to future precipitation increases caused \nby climate change. \n \n9.  Systematic assistance. In 2009, ADB initiated a systematic approach to rehabilitating \nrural roads to paved condition and helping the government develop a sustainable road network. \nIn  2010,  ADB  approved  RRIP,  for  rehabilitating  505  km  of  rural  roads  with  four  outputs: \n(i) improved road asset management; (ii) increased road safety and safeguards; (iii) enhanced \nclimate  change  adaptation;  and  (iv)  efficient  project  management.  This  first  project  was \ncofinanced in parallel by (i) the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Export-Import \nBank of Korea (KEXIM), which financed the civil works of rehabilitating 280 km of rural roads and \nrelated consulting services; and (ii) the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), which financed the \nclimate change adaptation output. \n \n10.  In 2016, after 5 years of project implementation, MRD successfully completed all ADB- \nand KEXIM-financed outputs on time and within budget, building substantial capacity in multiple \nareas  of  project  implementation.5  Capacity  building  was  highly  notable  for  the  Social  and \nEnvironment Office (SEO), which was established in 2012 under MRD to implement social and \nenvironment safeguards, road safety, HIV prevention activities, and gender-related activities. \n \n11.  MRD showed strong ownership in designing the succeeding project using mostly the loan \nproceeds of the first project. ADB approved RRIP II in 2014 and additional cofinancing in 2015. \nRRIP II will rehabilitate 1,200 km of rural roads. Its cofinanciers are Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement (French Development Agency), the Government of Australia, KEXIM, and the \nNDF. Both RRIP and RRIP II followed a similar design with similar outputs and aimed to provide \nreliable all-year road access from provincial towns and agricultural rural areas to markets, \nemployment centers, and social services. RRIP covered seven rural provinces, with RRIP II \nincluding an additional three beneficiary provinces. Implementation of RRIP II is on track.6 \n \n12.  Capacity  development  support.  The  following  are  the  key  capacity  development \nachievements of RRIP and RRIP II, and their application to the proposed project.7 First, these two \nprojects  developed  a  structural  design  for  roads  that  would  boost  disaster  resilience  and \naccommodate increasing traffic. The design included: (i) increasing embankment heights; (ii) \nproviding cross drainage; (iii) selecting embankment materials suitable for increased permeability; \nand (iv) providing hardtop surface with double bituminous surface treatment pavement. This \n                                                \n4  ADB estimates that the fatality rate dropped from 74 deaths per billion vehicle-kilometers in 2015 to 55 in 2016. ADB \nmade this estimate for a developing low-income nation using a similar methodology adopted in Singapore, Malaysia, \nand Japan. Their fatality rates in 2015 were 7.8 (Singapore), 7.3 (Malaysia), and 6.2 (Japan). \n5  The NDF-financed output was completed in 2017. \n6  As of 31 March 2017, the overall project progress of RRIP II was about 37.6% against the planned 36.6%. \n7  Lessons Learned (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nimproved design will apply to the project roads of the proposed project.8 \n \n13.  Second, MRD established road selection criteria through ADB\u2019s systematic assistance in \ncapacity development. MRD first selects project provinces with the highest poverty incidence and \nthen prioritizes access, making sure that the project roads will connect to already paved national, \nprovincial, or rural roads. MRD applies further criteria on realizing maximum economic potential \nand creating synergies with ADB-financed rural development projects in other subsectors such \nas water management, irrigation, and agricultural value chain development (footnote 8). \n \n14.  Third, the two projects provided a strong capacity-building program for improving the \noverall institutional arrangements to ensure sustainable rural road asset management. RRIP \ncompleted a program to prevent overloading on rural roads and to manage road assets more \neffectively.  It  also  focused  on  improving  the  overall  construction  industry  for  rural  road \nmaintenance,  including  developing  the  capacity  of  the  provincial  departments  of  rural \ndevelopment (PDRDs), which implement road maintenance works. PDRDs now conduct routine \nroad maintenance with adequate budgetary support. To support rural road asset management, \neffective axle load control is a key requirement. In fact, axle load control improved during the \nimplementation of the first two projects.9 \n \n15.  Fourth, the two projects strengthened the capacity of MRD\u2019s SEO staff. RRIP and RRIP II \nused consulting services to implement programs on increasing the awareness of road safety of \nproject beneficiaries. SEO strengthened its capacity through these programs and has since \nbecome a role model for government bodies in addressing crosscutting social, safeguard, and \ngender issues. SEO also demonstrates good practice in the equal participation of women. The \nimplementation of the HHTPP and the labor and gender action plan (LGAP) also supported SEO\u2019s \ncapacity development. During the implementation of the proposed project, SEO staff is expected \nto implement, monitor, and report on the road safety program, social safeguards, indigenous \npeoples, and gender elements. \n \n16.  Through such systematic assistance, MRD has gradually gained adequate capacity to \nimplement rural road development projects with minimal support from consultants. \n \n17.  Strategic context. The proposed project is in line with the government's Rectangular \nStrategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency: Phase III.10 The strategy places priority \non stepping up the construction of national, provincial, and rural roads, particularly by targeting \nthe paving of 300\u2013400 km of roads each year with asphalt or concrete. Also, the government\u2019s \nNational Strategic Development Plan 2014\u20132018 emphasizes improvement of economy through \nbetter transport infrastructure.11 The paving of rural roads enables all-year and all-weather access \nto markets, farms, schools, pagodas, health centers, and the local community. It will also \ncontribute to the achievement of one of the strategy\u2019s goals, which is to serve the population\u2019s \nneeds and promote economic development. \n \n18.  The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for \n                                                \n8  Output: Rural Road Improvements\u2013Road Selection Criteria (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n9  The reduction rate of overloading violations in the project provinces of RRIP improved from 40% in 2011 to 50% in \n2015. \n10 Government of Cambodia. 2013.

Rehabilitating rural roads and increasing their resilience against disasters and \nclimate change will support inclusive economic growth, help ease poverty, and enhance social \ndevelopment and equity. \n \n19.  Development partner contributions. Although ADB has been leading the efforts to \nimprove rural roads in Cambodia, other development partners also contributed. The Government \nof Germany through KfW, the Government of Japan, the World Bank, the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea through KEXIM, the Government of Australia, the NDF, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and the Government of France through Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement have collectively improved about 2,160 km of rural roads to paved condition since \n2005. Ongoing projects financed by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the \nGovernment of Germany through KfW, and the World Bank will improve an additional 500 km of \nrural roads to paved condition. \n \n20.  Climate  change  adaptation.  RRIP  supported  initial  climate  change  adaptation \ninterventions in climate-resilient road design; hazard mapping; maintenance planning; green \nplanting; and emergency preparedness, response, and recovery planning. The outcomes of these \ninitiatives were replicated in the ongoing road project of the Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport.13 Meanwhile, RRIP II supports the (i) implementation of green planting in all project \nprovinces; and (ii) design and implementation of a community-based emergency management \nsystem for an island cluster in the Mekong River, in Kampong Cham Province.14 In the proposed \nproject, a climate risk assessment revealed that the intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall \nevents will increase, with 5-day and 1-day storms expected to increase by 10% by 2030 and 20% \nby 2050. The most vulnerable provinces are Prey Veng and Svay Rieng. The proposed climate \nchange adaptation measures are to raise the embankments and provide cross drainage.15 \n \n21.  Value added by ADB assistance. The proposed project helps MRD improve rural road \nconstruction and maintenance practices by making use of knowledge obtained by ADB\u2019s previous \ninitiatives in RRIP and RRIP II, through continuous supports for the five provinces including four \nnew provinces. For example: (i) MRD has selected and will design the project roads based on the \nexperiences of RRIP and RRIP II (paras. 12 and 13); (ii) PDRDs will maintain the project roads to \nthe required quality (para. 14); and (iii) SEO will use own staff resources with some support from \nrecruited facilitators, as well as detailed design and implementation supervision (DDIS) consultants \nto implement road safety and social programs (para. 15). Upon completion of the project, MRD is \nexpected to develop and maintain, using its own capacity, the rural road network to reasonable \nquality. Thus, the proposed project will be the last phase of ADB\u2019s capacity development support to \nMRD for improving the rural road network using conventional design and quality. Based on their \nproven effectiveness in RRIP, overhead control gates will be installed under the proposed project \nto reduce the road damage and road maintenance burden inflicted by overloaded vehicles. Further, \nthe proposed project will use the disaster risk reduction financing mechanism to finance activities \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

Impacts and Outcome \n \n22.  The project is aligned with the following impact: needs of the population served and \neconomic development promoted (footnote 10). The project will have the following outcome: \nall-weather access in rural areas of the five project provinces improved.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n23.  Output 1: Rural roads improved. The project will rehabilitate about 360 km of rural roads \nto disaster-resilient paved condition and reduce the average roughness of project roads. MRD \nplans to increase SEO staff from 7 to 11 and engage DDIS consultants to implement this output \n(footnote 8). \n \n24.  Output 2: Rural road asset management improved. Under this output, MRD will \nincrease the annual operation and maintenance budget for project roads to a sufficient level which \nwill keep the reasonable quality of the roads. PDRDs need to conduct routine maintenance and \nbudgetary support needs to be adequately allocated for maintaining already paved rural roads. \nThe project will also install overload control gates to curtail overloaded and oversized trucks for \neffective axle load control.18 \n \n25.  Output 3: Awareness of road safety and potential social problems strengthened. \nUnder this output, (i) community residents will improve their knowledge and understanding of road \nsafety measures;19 (ii) community residents and contractors\u2019 personnel will improve their HHTPP \nawareness; and (iii) SEO will establish a sex-disaggregated baseline socioeconomic database \nand receive training on designing and conducting a socioeconomic survey. \n \n26.  All three outputs are gender sensitive and have relevant gender indicators. The LGAP \ndescribes the gender-related activities.20 SEO will implement the LGAP for the overall project with \nsupport from DDIS consultants. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n27.  The project is estimated to cost $66.00 million, including taxes and duties of $5.48 million \n(Table 1).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n32.  The project covers 22 subproject roads, all of which were subjected to due diligence. The \nproject  is  technically  viable  because  the  design  considered  local  design  standards  and \nconstruction materials, and equipment compatible with local conditions. All 360 km will be paved \nfor all-year and all-weather access\u2014short road sections through congested market areas will be \npaved in concrete, while the remaining roads will have a double bituminous surface treatment. \nUnder the rural road asset management output, MRD will erect concrete and/or steel barriers to \nprevent entry of oversized and overloaded trucks, which can be easily maintained using locally \navailable technology. Safe school zones will have road markings, signs, retractable humps, and \nrumble strips. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  Rural roads improvement under the project will serve about 680,000 beneficiaries who are \nmostly poor rural residents. The approach used to evaluate the project follows the standard \npractice of comparing the lifecycle costs of the road agency and the road users, with and without \nthe project. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 40.1% for the project and above 6.0% \nfor the individual road sections. Sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR is most sensitive to \nvariations in traffic from the base year or the traffic growth rate. In the severe case of costs \nincreasing by 50% and traffic decreasing by 50%, the EIRR remains at 14.6%, which is higher \nthan the 6.0% threshold. The risk analysis shows that the project is highly viable economically. \n ", "8 \n \n34.  Since the project does not generate its own revenue, the financial analysis focused on the \nfinancial sustainability of the executing agency. Government funding of routine maintenance for \nrural roads has increased steadily since 2015. The percentage of the maintenance requirement \nfor the rural road network covered by government financing increased from 70.6% in 2015 to \n92.7% in 2017. This maintenance requirement covers routine and periodic maintenance. Based \non the trend for increased funding for the maintenance of rural roads and stronger control of \noverloaded vehicles through the project, the financial analysis expects the government\u2019s budget \nprovision for the operation and maintenance of the project roads to be sustainable.23 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n35.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MRD. MRD will apply the policy throughout project implementation. In \ncoordination with the government, ADB developed a good governance framework (GGF), which \nis included as Annex 1 in the PAM and will be posted on the MRD and ADB websites. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures to ensure good governance are described in \nthe  GGF.  Review  missions  will  closely  monitor  compliance  with  GGF  provisions  and \nrequirements. Project procurement-related review report issued in September 2016 pointed out \nbid evaluation issues in some cases of procurement of RRIP and RRIP II.24 Although the follow-\nup review indicated improvements in compliance with Cambodia\u2019s procurement requirement, the \nprocurement risk is substantial and will be mitigated through appropriate staffing at PMU and \nclose monitoring by ADB and Ministry of Economy and Finance.25 The financial management \nassessment of MRD confirmed that the financial management risk is moderate and arises mainly \nfrom significant turnover of junior staff. The risk will be mitigated by recruiting sufficient staff and \nproviding training to junior staff. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming at entry. ADB has prepared a \nLGAP for the project, which includes gender actions and targets to promote women\u2019s voice and \nactive participation in project activities. LGAP implementation for RRIP and RRIP II is on track. \nResults from the first two projects show that women are the main direct beneficiaries of road \nconstruction and maintenance. The benefits of improved roads, particularly for women in rural \nareas, include shorter travel times, greater mobility, and better access to basic facilities and \nservices. With easier access, school attendance will improve in general but particularly among \ngirls, and the rate of secondary education completion is expected to increase. Easier access to \nhealth centers should contribute to better health outcomes and help reduce the incidence of child \nand maternal mortality. Road improvements also have a positive effect on household incomes \nbecause they increase the opportunities for business, trading, and local employment. \n \n37.  SEO will continue to use the training materials and tools developed under the RRIP to \npromote women\u2019s access to jobs. Men and women will receive equal pay for equal work. Any \nnegative social impacts that greater connectivity may create will be monitored and mitigated \n                                                \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 2016.

A rural road safety community awareness program will promote the safety \nof road users and residents, with the active involvement and participation of women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project\u2019s safeguard categories \nare as follows. \n \n39.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) covering all project roads were prepared, endorsed by MRD and disclosed \non ADB website on 18 April 2018. Works will be limited to the existing rights-of-way. Potential \nnegative environmental impacts will be short-term and localized during peak construction activities, \nsuch as access disruption, traffic noise, and dust. Potentially sensitive environmental receptors \nalong  the  road  corridors  include  villages,  schools,  pagodas,  and  river  crossings.  Public \nconsultations informed project design and will continue during implementation. The EMP details the \nmitigation and monitoring measures for identified impacts, institutional arrangements and the \nbudget for implementation. Loan covenants specify environmental safeguard requirements. MRD \nenvironmental capacity will be supported through project implementation consulting services. A \nproject grievance redress mechanism will help facilitate the resolution of complaints. \n \n40.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). MRD carried out poverty and social assessment \ndue diligence based on the preliminary design. It also carried out additional resettlement due \ndiligence with walk-over surveys to confirm that no land acquisition and resettlement impacts will \narise.26 In fact, the construction works will take place within the existing rights-of-way assigned to \nrural roads, owned by MRD on government land. MRD prepared a community participation \nframework with criteria for voluntary land donation, in some cases for minor realignment, which \nwill require narrow strips of land to be made available.27 Impact on structures will be avoided \nthrough road design modifications. The specific requirements for meaningful consultations with \ncommunities are discussed in the community participation framework. The government ensured \nthat the project would not finance any road section that would require involuntary resettlement or \nland acquisition, and that the due diligence report will be (i) updated upon completion of the \ndetailed engineering design to exclude resettlement or land acquisition impacts and (ii) submitted \nto ADB for review and concurrence. \n \n41.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Based on due diligence, the government ensured that \nthe project would not finance any road section that would have negative impacts on ethnic \nminorities or indigenous peoples. MRD will update the due diligence report upon completion of \nthe detailed engineering design to exclude any impact on ethnic minorities and indigenous \npeoples and submit the updated report to ADB for review and concurrence. The communities will \nbenefit from the improvement of rural roads to paved standard, through less exposure to dust and \nbetter health results. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \n                                                \n26 Due Diligence Report on Social Safeguards (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Community Participation Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement risk related  The PMU consists of experienced staff who are aware of the lessons \nto bid evaluation   learned from procurement for the previous projects.
