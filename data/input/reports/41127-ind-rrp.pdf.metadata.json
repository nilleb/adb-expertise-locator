Road  improvement  works  under  the  Project \ninclude  upgrading  of  existing  roads  to  two  lanes,  strengthening \nculverts  and  bridges,  constructing  new  bridges  and  cross-\ndrainage  structures,  and  constructing  structures  for  resettlement \nand rehabilitation.   \n \nThe  Project  will  enhance  overall  sector  management  capacity  by \nproviding  (i)  equipment  necessary  for  the  government  of  Bihar \n(GOB) to enhance sector capacity in areas such as quality control, \nsurvey  and  design,  road  safety,  and  control  of  overloading  and \nvehicle  emissions;  and  (ii)  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support \ninstitutional  development  initiatives  of  GOB,  especially  for  reform \nof  the  Road  Construction  Department  (RCD)  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  including  (a)  modernization  of  road  institutions, \n(b) improvements to RCD business processes, and (c) support for \nincreasing private sector participation. \n \nThe road network in Bihar is very  poor in terms of coverage and \nincreasing. \nfor  road \nconditions  while  demand \nInsufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance  has  increased  the \nnumber of roads that are beyond maintainable condition, and the \nbacklog  of  deferred  maintenance.  GOB  is  undertaking  the  State \nHighway Development Program to rehabilitate and upgrade state \nhighways  to  at  least  two  lanes  and  expand  the  state  highway \nnetwork  by  upgrading  major  district  roads  to  two  lanes.  The \nimprovement of 820 km of state highways is part of a series of the \nprogram to help meet increased demands for road transport, and \naccelerate the process of economic development in the state. \n \n\ntransport \n\nis \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\nRCD,  in  charge  of  overall  sector  development  and  management, \nlacks  modern  project  management  and  procurement  systems. \nThis often leads to cost and time overruns in project delivery. For \nefficient and effective road asset development and management, \nRCD  needs  to  be  modernized  by  (i)  harnessing  private  sector \nstructures and skills to meet the public demand for infrastructure; \n(ii) encouraging private sector participation in road financing; and \n(iii)  outsourcing \nfunctions  of  project  preparation,  design, \nconstruction, construction supervision, and quality audit to private \nentities.  Improvements  to  road  safety  and  control  of  overloading \nand vehicle emissions are also required for the safe and efficient \nuse of road assets with minimal adverse environmental impacts. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  of  the  state  road \nnetwork,  which  will  contribute \nto  expansion  of  economic \nopportunities  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be  realized  by \n(i)  improving  the  state  highway  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and \nappropriate  road  usage,  (iii)  increasing  efficiency  of  transport \nservices,  and  (iv)  enhancing  GOB  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment  and  management.  Improved  roads  will  improve \naccessibility  to  social  services  and  markets,  and  enhance  the \nefficiency of road transport usage. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $468  million, \nincluding taxes and duties.  \n \nA loan of $420,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \nThe  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  will  provide  the  loan \nproceeds  in  local  currency  to  GOB  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  received  from  ADB.  GOB  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange risk on the loan. \n \nUntil 31 July 2012 \n \n31 January 2012 \n\n \nGOB through RCD \n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nimplement \n\nThe  project  management  unit,  headed  by  the  chief  engineer  at \nRCD  headquarters,  will \nthe  Project.  Project \nimplementation  units,  each  headed  by  a  project  manager,  have \nbeen established and will be responsible for implementation in the \nfield.  One  or  two  full-time  project  managers  will  be  assigned  for \neach  contract  package.  The  project  managers  will  be  delegated \nadequate  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious \nproject implementation. RCD will engage construction supervision \nconsultants to act as the engineer for the construction contracts. \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. The civil works contracts will be procured under international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  Project  will  provide  $4  million  for \nequipment  to  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if the estimated contract is valued from $0.1 million to \n$1  million,  and  shopping  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is  less \nthan $0.1 million. \n \nTwo international consulting firms will be recruited for construction \nsupervision  of  civil  works  under  the  Project.  RCD  will  select  and \nengage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nAbout  68  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  3,020 \nperson-months of national consultants will be required. \n \nImproving management of the state highway network through the \nthe \ninstitutional  development  component  and \nimprovement  to  the  road  network  under  the  Project  will  enhance \nthe  overall  road  condition  and  usability  of  state  trunk  roads.  This \nwill  increase  travel  speeds,  and  reducing  travel  time,  accidents, \noverloading,  and  vehicle  emissions.  The  Project  will  enhance \nRCD capacity for road asset development and management. This \nwill improve governance in road administration and accountability, \nand  create  an  environment  encouraging  competition  and \nefficiency  within  RCD  and  the  construction  industry.  This  will \nensure  more  efficient  road  asset  development  and  management, \nand  higher  quality  of  construction  and  maintenance,  resulting  in \ndecreased recurrent costs over the medium and long term. These \nwill lead to overall social and economic development in Bihar. \n \nPoverty  is  high  in  Bihar,  among  the  highest  of  all  India\u2019s  states. \nThe  Project  will  improve  access  to  socioeconomic  services, \ntransport \nincrease  employment  opportunities,  and \nservices.  This  will  reduce  poverty  in  the  region,  and  stimulate \neconomic growth and human development in the state. Improved \nmobility will provide households with better-paying jobs outside of \ntheir villages.  \n \n\nthe  TA,  and \n\nimprove \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nthe  state \n\nthe  context  of \n\nThe  risk  of  initial  delays  has  been  mitigated  through  advance \nactions  by  RCD  and  support  provided  by  ADB.  Training  on \nsafeguard  and  procurement  requirements  was  provided  to  RCD \nstaff  to  mitigate  potential  risk  of  initial  delays  due  to  procedural \nclearance.  ADB  has  provided  support  to  due  diligence  for  all \nproject roads. \n \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated \ninstitutional \nby  reflecting \nstrengthening  action  plan.  The  plan  considers  the  rather  short-\nterm  project  duration,  actions \ntaken  by  GOB,  Planning \nCommission  recommendations,  and  recent  development  policy \nloan approved by the World Bank.  \n \nThe  risk  of  maintenance  financing  will  be  mitigated  by  GOB \ninitiatives  to  implement  road  asset  management  systems  for \nits \nbetter  planning  and  budgeting.  GOB  has \nmaintenance  budget  to  substantially  meet  requirements  and \nobtained \nthe \n12th  Finance  Commission.  RCD\u2019s  strict  monitoring  systems  for \nproject  implementation  minimize  the  risk  of  underutilizing  the \nmaintenance budget. \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  a  TA  will  be  provided  to  support \nGOB sector development initiatives. RCD will be developed into a \nstate-of-the-art  road  agency  equipped  with  modern  systems  of \nbusiness  procedures,  planning  processes,  quality  assurance, \nengineering  (pavement  design,  maintenance  methods,  and \nsafety),  and  human  resource  management.  The  estimated  total \ncost  of  the  TA  is  $1,250,000,  of  which  ADB  will  finance \n$1,000,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  TA  funding  program. \nThe  TA  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n\nfull  Government  grant-in-aide  under \n\nincreased \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  India  for  the  Bihar  State  Highways  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  Bihar  Road  Sector,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nBihar,  a  landlocked  state  lying  in  the  middle  Gangetic  region,  has  an  area  of  94,164 \n2. \nsquare  kilometers.  It  is  surrounded  by  Uttar  Pradesh  (west),  Jharkhand  (south),  West  Bengal \n(east),  and Nepal  (north).  The  state  has  a  rich  history  and  cultural  tradition,  making  it  a  major \nreligious and tourist destination. While it has an extensive and well-developed rail system, and \nconsiderable  potential  for  developing  and  utilizing  inland  waterways,  rapid  development  and \nstrengthening  of  the  road  network  will  provide  momentum  for  accelerating  economic \ndevelopment in the state, enabling Bihar to move from being dependent on subsistence farming \nto focusing on market-oriented agriculture and tourism. Since Bihar is the third most populous, \npoorest, and slowest-growing state in fast-growing India, development of the state is key to the \ncountry\u2019s goal of regionally balanced growth. \n \n3. \nBihar has 82,000 kilometers (km) of roads; 45,000 km are surfaced. It has 3,723 km of \nnational  highways,  3,128  km  of  state  highways,  7,714  km  of  major  district  roads  (MDRs),  and \n67,080  km  of  other  district  roads  (ODRs)  and  village  roads.  The  road  density  is  901  km  per \nmillion  population  compared  with  the  national  average  of  2,567  km.  Almost  all  of  the  higher \nclass  of  roads  (national  highways,  state  highways,  and  MDRs)  are  provided  with  a  sealed \n(bitumen or concrete) surface, while 55% of ODRs and village roads remain unsealed. Only 2% \nof state highways have two or more lanes; 71% are single lane. For MDRs, 83% are single lane. \nAll ODRs and village roads are single lane. The majority of state highways, MDRs, ODRs, and \nvillage roads are assessed to have deteriorated severely and require major rehabilitation largely \nbecause  of  the  continuous  short  fall  in  investment  for  road  maintenance  until  recently,  and \nincreasing  volume  of  traffic  and  loads.  The  need  to  increase  and  improve  the  existing  state \nhighway  network  is  critical.  This can  be  accomplished  by  widening  existing  carriageways,  and \nstrengthening and constructing or reconstructing bridges and culverts. \n \n4. \nBihar  Road  Construction  Department  (RCD)  is  responsible  for  state  highways,  MDRs, \nand national highways approved and funded by the Government of India (the Government). Of \nthe  3,700  km  of  national  highways  in  Bihar,  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  is \nresponsible  for  800  km.  The  Government  recently  approved  upgrading  890  km  of  national \nhighways  to  four  lanes  under  the  National  Highway  Development  Program  III  using  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT).  Roads  that  GOB  identifies  for  development  on  a  BOT  basis  are \nentrusted  to  India  Infrastructure  Finance  Company  and  Infrastructure  Development  Finance \nCompany  to  structure  and  implement  the  projects.  District  councils  and  the  Rural  Works \nDepartment  are  responsible  for  ODRs  and  village  roads.  The  Rural  Works  Department  is \nresponsible  for  the  chief  minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  Mukhya  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(MMGSY),  which  connects  habitations  with  populations  of  500\u2013999,  in  parallel  with  the \nnationwide  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(PMGSY),  which  gives  priority  to  connectivity  for  habitations  with  populations  of  more  than \n1,000. The chief minister\u2019s rural roads program follows the basic principles and incorporates the \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\ngood  practices  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  but  employs  more  decentralized \nadministrative  and  technical  sanction  procedures,  and  utilizes  a  separate  set  of  guidelines  for \nproject selection.  \n \nBudgetary  expenditure  for  state  roads  in  2006/07  was  Rs1,974  crore 1 ($506  million) \n5. \nagainst an original budget of Rs2,147 crore ($551 million). In 2006/07, the budget was 2.8 times \nas large as the previous year\u2019s Rs648 crore  ($171 million) due to the new state government\u2019s \npriority  for  road  rehabilitation  and  development,  supported  by  the  Government\u2019s  Backward \nRegion Grant Fund (Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana or RSVY). The extent of underspending was \nonly  8%  of  the  original  budget.  This  demonstrates  remarkable  improvement  in  RCD  capacity \nand  commitment  to  deliver.  The  2007/08  budget  has  gone  up  further  to  Rs2,379  crore  ($610 \nmillion). \n \n6. \nRevenues  relating  to  road  use  include  vehicle  taxes,  permits,  fees,  and  penalties  and \nwere Rs308 crore ($124 million) in 2005/06, up from Rs178 crore ($87 million) in 2002/03. The \naverage  annual  increase  is  very  high  at  20%  due  to  improved  vehicle  registration  and  tax \npayment.  In  addition,  road  users  pay  commercial  sales  taxes  for  such  items  as  vehicles,  fuel, \ntires,  and  spare  parts.  The  Bihar  Transport  Department  is  a  major  resource-generating \ndepartment, along with the commercial tax, registration, and excise departments. \n \nThe  Transport  Department  is  responsible  for  licensing,  registration,  and  regulation  of \n7. \nmotor  vehicles,  drivers,  and  passenger  and  freight  transport.  Motor  vehicle  registration \nincreased from 0.95 million in 2000/01 to 1.56 million in 2006/07, an annual average of 8.6%. \nThe highest increase was for two-wheelers; when they are excluded, registration increased by \n5.5%.  Of  the  1.56  million  motor  vehicles  registered,  68%  were  two-wheelers.  Excluding  two \nwheelers,  registered  vehicles  comprise  cars  and  jeeps  (31%),  trucks  (10%),  buses  and \nminibuses (3%), and  tractors and trailers (43%). \n \nThe state-owned Bihar State Road Transport Corporation provides intra- and interstate \n8. \nbus services. It currently operates 2%\u20133% of buses in the state, and is authorized by GOB to fix \nits  fares  based  on  sound  business  principles.  GOB  grants  permission  for  contract  and  private \nbuses also on the same routes of the State Road Transport Corporation. Private bus operators \nadopt fares based on demand for specific routes. Truck hire rates are fixed by market demand. \nPrivate  sector  operators  provide  most  of  the  services  for  passenger  and  freight  transport. \nCompetition is good. \n \n9. \nprovides details of the road sector in Bihar.   \n \nB. \n\nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  1.  Appendix  2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nMain Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n\n \n10. \nThe state\u2019s road network is very poor in terms of coverage and conditions. Demand for \nroad transport is increasing. Insufficient funding to road maintenance in the past has increased \nthe  number  of  roads  that  are  beyond  maintainable  condition  and  the  backlog  of  deferred \nmaintenance. GOB has taken on the State Highway Development Program to rehabilitate and \nupgrade state highways to at least 2 lanes, and expand the state highway network by upgrading \nMDRs to 2 lanes. The program covers upgrading 2,831 km of the 3,127 km of state highways \n\n                                                 \n1 A crore is equal to 10,000,000. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nduring  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  period  through  various  schemes,  including  the  Government-\nsupported RSVY, BOT schemes, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. \n \n11. \nGOB  also  takes  on  sector  development  initiatives  in  the  framework  specified  in  Bihar \nRoad  Sector  Development\u2013New  Dimensions 2  to  develop  and  sustain  the  road  network  by \nmodernizing  road  agencies;  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  road  financing; \noutsourcing  design,  supervision,  and  construction  along  with  systems  for  independent  proof \nchecking  and  audit;  setting  up  a  stable  source  of  funding  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance;  attracting  financially  sound  and  fully  equipped  contractors  by  offering  large \ncontracts  for  national  and  state  highway  projects;  enabling  smaller  contractors  to  acquire \nexperience; introducing long-term, performance-based maintenance contracts; initiating corridor \nmanagement  to  expedite  clearance  of  utilities  and  availability  of  materials;  and  strengthening \ncapacity of local contractors. \n \n\na. \n\nReform and Capacity Building in Road Sector Management \n\n \nApproaches identified by the Bihar road sector development strategy (footnote 2) include \n12. \n(i)  harnessing  private  sector  structures  and  skills  to  meet  public  demand  for  infrastructure;  \n(ii)  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  road  financing;  and  (iii)  outsourcing  functions  of \nproject  preparation,  design,  construction,  construction  supervision,  and  quality  audit  to  private \nentities. This would leave government functionaries with the limited but important responsibility \nof  policy  development  and  management  oversight,  and  improving  accountability  concentrating \non performance monitoring and output, rather than the day-to-day running of public services. \n \nFor this purpose, RCD initially outsourced works of upgrading old state highways under \n13. \nRSVY  with  Rs3,000  crores  ($790  million)  to  other  road  implementation  agencies,  targeting \ncompletion by 2008/09. Work on the remaining 1,554 km, of newly declared state highways, is \nproposed  to  be  implemented  with  international  best  practices  with  ADB  financing,  adopting \nFIDIC3-based contract management and international competitive bidding procedures. GOB has \nbeen discussing potential BOT projects for 500 km of national highways with India Infrastructure \nFinance Company and Infrastructure Development Finance Company. \n \nRCD  is  considering  setting  up  a  state  roads  and  highways  development  authority  or \n14. \ncorporation  to  streamline  decision  making  and  increase  autonomy  for  project  execution  and \ndelivery.  This  requires  redefinition  of  powers,  functions,  and  accountability  of  road  agencies; \nand  changes  to  existing  business  procedures.  Major  actions  taken  by  RCD  so  far  include \nstreamlining  bidding  procedures,  quality  control,  asset  management,  and  project  management \nand  monitoring.  RCD\u2019s  sector  management  capability,  which  was  significantly  strengthened \nduring the last one and half years, will be improved under the Project. The established project \nmanagement unit (PMU) for the ADB project is considered an embryo cell to be expanded and \nstrengthened to become an autonomous authority for state road development and maintenance. \n \n\nb. \n\nRoad Maintenance Financing \n\n \nThe  nonplan  budget  increased  from  Rs201  crore  ($52  million)  in  2003/04  to  \n15. \nRs311  crore  ($80  million)  in  2006/07,  an  annual  increase  of  15.6%.  The  maintenance \nrequirement  until  completion  of  the  State  Highway  Development  Program  is  not  high  as  most \n\n                                                 \n2   Government of India. 2007. Bihar Road Sector Development \u2013 New Dimensions. New Delhi. \n3 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\nstate highways and MDRs will be upgraded under the program. After the program, the budget \nrequirement  for  maintenance  will  be  increased  and  is  estimated  at  Rs420  crore  ($108  million) \nannually.  Revenue  relating  to  road  use  is  estimated  at  Rs308  crore  ($79  million)  in  2005/06, \nexcluding  excise,  with  historical  increase  of  20%  per  annum.  This  matches  maintenance \nrequirements and is absorbed in the general government revenue. \n \n16. \nEfficiency of the use of nonplan budget has improved. The share of salaries and wages \nin  the  nonplan  budget  reduced  from  43%  in  2003/04  to  36%  in  2006/07.  This  demonstrates \nGOB\u2019s increased commitment to maintenance and efficiency of road maintenance. Considering \npast budgetary provisions and trends, GOB is assessed as adequately providing maintenance \nfinancing in a sustainable manner. Increased maintenance quality due to introduction of 5-year \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  maintenance  works \nand  reduce  maintenance  costs.  GOB  has  provided  assurance  that  it  will  provide  adequate \nfinancing to maintain state highways developed with ADB financing.  \n \n\nc. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n17. \nBihar has a higher accident rate (17.3 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles between 2001 and \n2004) than the national average (12.8 in 2003), and the rate is expected to increase as traffic \ngrows.  One  of  the  major  causes  of  accidents  is  lack  of  awareness  and  knowledge  of  traffic \nrules. To enhance awareness of traffic rules, the Transport Department organizes a road safety \nweek every year for school children and the public. In Patna and major district centers including \nrural areas, the Transport Department undertakes inspection missions to ensure people follow \ntraffic  rules.  GOB  is  planning  to  establish  state  and  district  road  safety  councils  to  provide \nguidance on road safety.  \n \n18. \nRCD will develop a road safety unit within its organization to institutionalize road safety \naudits, ensuring safety elements of India Roads Congress standards are incorporated in design \nand during construction. \n \n19. \nIn  1996,  the  Government  recommended  establishing  a  directorate  of  safety  and  traffic \nmanagement  and  set  up  a  road  safety  fund  allocating  1%  of  cess  revenue  for  national \nhighways. An expert committee at the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways will \nreview  these  recommendations  and  finalize  a  road  safety  policy  to  address  legal,  institutional, \nand  financial  issues  for  road  safety.  This  will  provide  a  new  context  for  the  funding  and \ninstitutional setup for state road safety. \n \n\nd. \n\nOverloading \n\n \n20. \nOverloading  is  a  nationwide  problem;  the  number  of  multiaxle  trailers  has  increased. \nOverloaded trucks on Bihar\u2019s major highways are also expected to increase in accordance with \neconomic  growth.  An  overloading  control  program  is  being  set  up;  six  weighbridges  are  being \ninstalled at state border points. More weighbridges will be installed, and regulations more strictly \nenforced, e.g., off-loading of overloaded trucks will be enforced in coordination with the police. \n \n\ne. \n\nVehicle Pollution Control \n\n \n21. \nTo support a clean environment, GOB amended the 1992 Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules to \nrequire  all  vehicles  to  have  a  pollution  control  certificate.  All  vehicles  must  undergo  pollution \nchecks  to  obtain  the  certificate.  While  it  continues  to  establish  permanent  pollution  check \ncenters, GOB is encouraging the private sector to develop centers and has given permission for \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n103  so  far.  GOB  has  established  centers  in  21  of  the  38  districts  in  the  state.  Emission  test \nmachines are further required for each center.  \n \n\nf. \n\nConstruction Industry \n\nKey  sector  development  initiatives  are  summarized  in  the  institutional  strengthening \n\n \n22. \nThe  proposed  large  programs  require  good  construction  firms  equipped  with  adequate \ntechnical personnel and modern construction machinery. In the absence of regular work in the \npast,  the  state\u2019s  construction  industry  has  become  weak;  only  a  few  contractors  are  from \noutside the state. Local contractors have difficulty mobilizing the necessary financial resources \nto even bid and subsequently implement the works. \n \n23. \nA local construction industry can develop around a large program if work is seen to be \navailable  on  a  regular  basis  over  a  long  time.  Initially,  local  agencies  could  associate  with \nqualified  construction  firms  from  outside  the  state,  and  acquire  the  necessary  technical  and \nmanagerial skills to subsequently qualify on their own. Good contractors from outside the state \nwill  invest  their  resources  only  if  they  perceive  a  good  opportunity  in  terms  of  contract  size. \nUnder the Project, GOB made the contracts as large as possible to attract qualified bidders. \n \n24. \nThe infrastructure equipment bank was set up to lease construction equipment to local \ncontractors, starting with the first three branches at Bhagalpur, Muzaffapur, and Patna. This will \nhelp  expedite  the  process  of  road  construction  in  the  state.  RCD  simplified  contractor \nregistration  rules  to  reduce  barriers  to  entry.  This  will  help  increase  competition  between \ncontractors, and hence increase quality and reduce cost. \n \n25. \naction plan (Appendix 3). \n \n \n \n26. \nExternal assistance to roads in India has been substantial. ADB has provided loans as \nwell as TA for about $3.7 billion. The World Bank has provided loans and grants totaling $5.6 \nbillion  for  upgrading  national  highways,  improving  state  highways,  and  upgrading  rural  roads. \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  has  provided  five  loans  for  a  total  of  $0.33 \nbillion  to  upgrade  national  highways  and  construct  bridges.  The  Government  of  the  United \nKingdom  has  provided  TA  to  support  the  sector.  ADB  support  has  been  developed  in  close \ncollaboration  with  these  key  development  partners.  Coordination  with  the  World  Bank  has \nparticularly been active for transport operations. Mini retreats for transport operations in South \nAsia have become a regular practice for headquarters staff. For the resident missions, a broad-\nbased  sector  collaboration  mechanism  has  been  instituted  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of \ninformation between key sector coordinators of both institutions. With the Government of Japan \nand JBIC, cooperation has been active, particularly for the railway and urban subsectors. ADB \nhas formed a close partnership with the Department for International Development (DFID) of the \nUnited Kingdom for the provision of TA for areas contributing to poverty reduction in India. Two \norganizations  hold  regular  coordination  meetings.  A  summary  of  external  assistance  is  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n27. \nSince  2002,  ADB  has  provided  four  loans  to  improve  India\u2019s  state  road  network;  to \nMadhya Pradesh in 2002 and 2007, Chhattisgarh in 2003, and Uttarakhand in 2006. Other state \nroad projects are being prepared for the eight northeastern states and Jharkhand. In principle, \nADB\u2019s  support  is  provided  to  improve  state  road  management  capacity  along  with  physical \ninvestment  to  improve  the  state  road  network.  The  states  have  shared  their  experience  to \n\nExternal Assistance and ADB Strategy \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nLessons \n\nimprove  sector  management  and  project  implementation  capacity.  ADB  facilitates  experience \nsharing by holding workshops in states utilizing TA for state road projects. \n \n28. \nTo  provide  assistance  to  Bihar,  ADB,  DFID,  and  the  World  Bank  have  established  a \nBihar assistance coordination working group. The World Bank approved a development policy \nloan  and  credit  in  20074 for  policy  and  institutional  reforms  covering  fiscal  and  procurement \nreforms,  governance  and  administrative  reforms,  investment  climate  reforms,  and  sector-\nspecific  policy  reforms.  For  the  road  sector  in  Bihar,  it  has  been  closely  coordinated  to  make \nsynergy. The World Bank is providing support to rural road development and medium- to long-\nterm  sector  reform,  while  ADB  provides  support  for  developing  state  roads  in  parallel  with \ninstitutional strengthening focusing on project delivery in coordination with DFID.  \n \n \n \n29.  Many  ongoing  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  India  are  experiencing  delays.  These \ndelays  are  mostly  attributable  to  (i)  lack  of  safeguard  consideration  in  the  selection  and \npreparation of investments, and insufficient support in safeguards planning and implementation; \nand  (ii)  the  gap  in  support  between  the  feasibility  phase  and  the  construction  phase  for \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  that  are  often  not  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  for \nprocurement  of  civil  works  contracts  and  recruitment  of  consultants.  For  the  Project,  RCD \nengaged detailed project report consultants to prepare subprojects and ADB provided support to \nRCD  preconstruction  activities  so  that  the  construction  can  commence  without  unnecessary \ndelay  after  loan  approval.  RCD  has  prepared  bidding  documents,  in  close  consultation  with \nADB,  and  initiated  advance  action  for  contracting,  such  as  engagement  of  construction \nsupervision consultants. RCD takes initiatives for speedy and quality completion of construction \nworks, which include regular weekly monitoring of project progress. \n \n30. \nFor  state  road  projects,  ADB  has  undertaken  policy  dialogue  in  sector  performance \nimprovement;  ADB\u2019s  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  recommends  broadening  policy \ndialogue  while  ADB  has  been  promoting  private  sector  involvement  in  roads,  mostly  in \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  activities  for  state  road  projects.  Under  the  Project,  TA  will  be \nprovided to support RCD initiatives in setting up enabling environments for implementing public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  schemes.  The  Project  takes  into  account  broad  areas  to  be  improved \nincluding development of the local construction industry. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n31. \nThe Project will improve transport efficiency of the state road network in Bihar, which will \ncontribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty reduction. This will be realized by \n(i)  improving  the  state  highway  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and  appropriate  road  usage,  \n(iii) increasing efficiency of transport services, and (iv) enhancing GOB capacity for road asset \ndevelopment and management. Improved roads will improve accessibility to social services and \nmarkets, and enhance the efficiency of road transport usage. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   IBRD and IDA. 2007. Program Document for a Proposed Loan in the Amount of US$150 million and a Proposed \nCredit  in  the  Amount  of  SDR  47.8  million  ($75  million  equivalent)  to  the  Republic  of  India  for  the  First  Bihar \nDevelopment Policy Loan and Credit to the Republic of India, Washington DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n32. \nInvestment  Component. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct about 820 km of \nstate  highways  identified  under  the  State  Highway  Development  Program,  focusing  on  newly \ndeclared state highways. Consulting services will be provided to support implementation of civil \nworks.  Under  the  program,  about  2,800  km  of  state  highways  and  5,700  km  of  MDRs  are \nidentified  for  rehabilitation  and  upgrading.  During  RCD\u2019s  detailed  project  report  preparation, \nmore than 1,000 km of state highways were initially selected and about 820 km of these were \nidentified  for  the  Project,  taking  into  account  preliminary  assessment  of  traffic  volume,  social \nand  environmental \nimpacts,  state  priority,  and  project  readiness  (Appendix  5).  Road \nimprovement  works  under  the  Project  include  improving  roads  to  two  lanes,  strengthening \nculverts and bridges, constructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures, and constructing \nstructures for resettlement and rehabilitation.   \n \n33. \nInstitutional Development Component. The Project will provide equipment required by \nGOB  to  enhance  sector  capacity  in  areas  such  as  quality  control,  survey  and  design,  road \nsafety, and control of overloading and vehicle emissions. Major equipment includes laboratory \nequipment,  survey  and  design  equipment  and  software,  vehicle  emission  and  fitness  testing \nmachine,  and  weighbridges.  The  consultants,  engaged  under  a  TA  to  support  institutional \nstrengthening,  will  identify  the  required  equipment  and  timing  for  installation  in  line  with  the \ndetailed institutional development action plan (Appendix 3). \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThis is the first road construction project in Bihar to adopt international best practices of \n34. \nprocurement  and  contract  management,  e.g.,  international  competitive  bidding,  FIDIC-based \ncontracts,  and  outsourcing  of  construction  supervision.  This  will  attract  qualified  contractors  to \nparticipate  in  state  projects.  Contracts  are  packaged  into  a  larger  size  to  attract  qualified \ncontractors who will transfer the necessary technical and managerial skills to local contractors \nthrough  association  like  subcontracts.  RCD  officials  will  be  exposed  to  international  best \npractices in bidding procedures and contract management. ADB will provide support to RCD in \nmanaging  FIDIC-based  contracts.  This  exposure  will  help  equip  RCD  with  capacity to  take  on \nmodern road development methods such as performance-based contracts, long-term operation \nand maintenance contracts, and public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  was  prepared  in  collaboration  with  state  government  officials  of  Madhya \nPradesh  Road  Development  Corporation;  they  have  gained  substantial  experience  with  ADB \nrequirements  and  procedures.  RCD  engaged  detailed  project  report  consultants  with  its  own \nfunds, for possible ADB financing, and requested ADB to supplement the consultants\u2019 work to \nfully comply with ADB requirements. The engineering design is prepared to minimize social and \nenvironmental impacts. Advance actions have been undertaken to ensure that the construction \ncan be commenced without unnecessary delay. All of these are enabled by the support of ADB \nconsultants,  various  exchanges  between  officials  of  state  road  agencies,  and  workshops  and \ntraining  provided.  The  Project  demonstrates  sufficient  lessons  accumulated  to  share  among \nstate  road  agencies  to  prepare  and  implement  successful  state  road  projects  with  improved \nproject readiness. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n36. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $468  million,  including  taxes,  duties, \ncommitment  charges,  and  interest  during  construction  (Table  1).  The  detailed  cost  estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 6.   \n \n37. \nADB will finance part of the local taxes and duties estimated at $47 million. On average, \ntaxes and duties, which amount to 9%\u201313% of project costs for construction of state highways \nin India, are considered reasonable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n39. \nThe ADB loan will finance about 90% of the project cost. This is considered acceptable, \ntaking into account that (i) the Project is part of the $2 billion state road development programs \nover  the  next  5  years,  excluding  projects  under  the  National  Highway  Development  Program, \nthe  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  and  the  chief  minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program;  (ii)  the \nProject is part of ADB assistance to the Government\u2019s overall development program for roads, \nincluding the National Highway Development Program III ($12.5 billion by 2012) and the Prime \nMinister\u2019s  rural  roads  program  ($11  billion  by  2009);  (iii)  state  road  development  is  the  priority \nfor ADB assistance in India and the Project serves one of the poorest states in India; (iv) even if \nthe Project is included to the country program and strategy period starting from 2003, average \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\ncost sharing will remain at 68%, which is less than the current country limit of 70%; and (v) the \nhigher cost sharing by ADB helps the state with fiscal reforms. \n \n40. \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  in  local  currency  to  GOB  on  the same \nterms  and  conditions  as  received  from  ADB.  GOB  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  on  the \nloan. The financing plan for the Project is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n420.0 \n48.0 \n\n468.0 \n\n% \n89.7 \n10.3 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be the state of Bihar through RCD. RCD has \n41. \nestablished a PMU at its headquarters, headed by a chief engineer, for implementation of the \nProject. RCD has also established five project implementation units, each headed by a project \nmanager, who will be responsible for the implementation of one or two project roads in the field. \nOne or two full-time project managers will be assigned for each contract package. The project \nmanagers  will  be  delegated  adequate  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious \nproject  implementation.  RCD  will  engage  construction  supervision  consultants  to  act  as  the \nengineer for the civil works contracts. The organization structure for project implementation is in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years, inclusive of procurement, preconstruction \n42. \nactivities in 2007, and defect liability period of 1 year. It is expected to be completed by January \n2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n43. \nProcurement  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil works contracts \nwill  be  undertaken  in  nine  contract  packages  (Appendix  9).  These  contracts  are  estimated  at \nmore  than  $10  million  and  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  ADB  standard  bidding  documents  for  large  works  with  postqualification  under  the \ntwo-envelope system will be adopted. Equipment financed by the Project will be $4 million under \nthe  institutional  development  component,  and  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive \nbidding procedures if the estimated contract is $0.1 million to $1.0 million, and shopping if the \nestimated  contract  amount  is  less  than  $0.1  million.  Contract  packaging  for  equipment  will  be \nbased on required technical features and timing of procurement. The TA consultants engaged \nfor  institutional  development  will  identify  the  packages  during  TA  implementation.  The \nprocurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  10.  National  competitive  bidding  procedures  adopted  for \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  use  the  advertised  tender  enquiry \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\nmethod  stipulated  in  the  General  Financial  Rules,  2005,  and  elaborated  in  the  Manual  on \nPolicies  and  Procedures  for  the  Purchase  of  Goods  issued  in  August  2006,  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance of the Government, with clarifications and modifications described in the procurement \nplan. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nRCD  will  recruit  two  international  consulting  firms  using  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method to supervise construction of civil works under the Project. One consultant will \nbe  engaged  for  the  north  region  and  the  other  for  the  south.  RCD  will  select  and  engage \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  About  68  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and about 3,020 person-months of national consultants will be required. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n45. \nADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  in  May  2007.  During  project \npreparation,  RCD\u2019s  procurement  activities  were  well  advanced;  all  contracts  were  bid  out  in \nFebruary 2008. Based on this, the Government and GOB requested retroactive financing for all \nproject  components.  Up  to  20%  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing, \nprovided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  for  the \nProject in accordance with agreed procedures and during the 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. The Government and GOB have been informed that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n46. \nwith  the  Government,  GOB,  and  RCD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine,  directly  or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject.  In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would be requested by ADB \nto  be  undertaken  by  the  Government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \nRCD  has  significantly  strengthened  its  governance  during  the  last  2  years.  It  has \n47. \nstandardized bidding documents and initiated e-procurement for selected contracts. For project \nmanagement  and  monitoring,  RCD  introduced  strict  monitoring  systems  of  work  progress, \ncontrolled under the newly established supervision and monitoring wing. It discloses the targets, \nprogress, and achievements to the public on the website and in the local newspaper. RCD has \nidentified  roads  for  inclusion  in  public\u2013private  partnership  schemes,  and  outsourced  all \nmaintenance works to the private sector. Accounting officers in field offices have been deputed \nfrom  the  accountant  general\u2019s  office  to  ensure  appropriate  recording  of  financial  matters.  To \nensure construction quality, laboratory equipment is being enhanced, and mobile quality control \nsquads have been established in all district offices. It also introduced a third-party quality control \nsystem.  To  enhance  competition  and  capacity  of  the  construction  industry,  RCD  set  up  an \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nequipment bank and simplified contractor registration rules. This will help increase competition \nbetween  contractors,  and  hence  increase  quality  and  reduce  cost.  To  enhance  overall  road \nsector  management,  TA  will  be  provided  for  institutional  strengthening  of  RCD,  which  will \nimprove  governance  of  road  administration  and  accountability  and  create  an  environment  that \nencourages  competition  and  efficiency  within  RCD  and  the  construction  industry.  For  the \nProject,  ADB  procurement  procedures  using  international  competitive  bidding  will  enhance \ntransparency  and  fair  competition,  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  FIDIC-based \ncontract management will mitigate corruption problems during implementation. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n48. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  will  be \nused  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  equipment.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed under statement of expenditure procedures will not exceed $100,000. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nRCD  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds \nunder the project components and their subprojects. The accounts will be set up in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  the \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually.  The  Government  will  submit  consolidated \nannual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 6 months from the end of \nthe  previous  fiscal  year.  The  annual  audit  report  will  include  an  audit  of  the  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures, and will include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds \nand compliance with statement of expenditure procedures. \n \nRCD will prepare and provide ADB with quarterly project progress reports, including any \n50. \nchanges  to  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  remedial \nactions  taken,  anticipated  problems  and  the  proposed  remedial  measures,  and  work  to  be \nundertaken in the following period. RCD will submit the quarterly progress reports to ADB within \n45 days from the close of each quarter. These reports will include a summary financial account \nfor  each  subproject,  expenditures  to  date,  report  on  performance  monitoring,  and  results  of \nmonitoring of social and environmental impacts. \n \nRCD  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  a  road  completion  report  within  3  months  of \n51. \nphysical completion of each individual road and a project completion report within 3 months of \ncompletion of transactions under the Project. These reports will provide a detailed evaluation of \nthe  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact, \neconomic rate of return, and other details relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nRCD will, within 3 months of the loan signing, develop a systematic project performance \n52. \nmonitoring  system,  in  a  form  and  substance  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  use  throughout  the  life  of \nthe Project. \n \nRCD  will  establish,  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  baseline  for  performance \n53. \nindicators  to  be  used  for  monitoring  implementation  of  each  road  subproject.  It  will  conduct \nannual evaluation surveys for each road subproject, in accordance with the project performance \n\n \n\n\f12 \n \n\n \n\nmonitoring  system,  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress,  and \nachievement of the project objectives. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nADB and RCD will meet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and \nany  changes  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  required  to  achieve  the \nproject  objectives.  They  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  focusing  on  issues  related  to \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the  project \nobjectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nin \n\ninitiatives  set  out \n\ninstitutional  development \n\nA TA for $1,000,000 for Institutional Strengthening of the Bihar Road Sector will support \n55. \nsome  of  GOB\u2019s \nthe  action  plan  \n(Appendix 3). The focus of the TA will be to (i) redefine and restructure RCD to a state-of-the-art \nroad agency, and (ii) implement new business procedures and provide training to RCD officials \nto  enable  RCD  to  restructure  and  adopt  a  new  institutional  and  management  structure.  New \nbusiness  procedures  will  cover  (i)  procurement  and  contracting  processes,  (ii)  planning \nprocesses,  (iii)  quality  assurance  systems,  (iv)  engineering  (pavement  design,  maintenance \nmethods, and safety), and (v) human resource management.  \n \n56. \nThe consultants will undertake the services in close consultation with principal secretary \nand  engineer-in-chief,  RCD.  They  will  conduct  district  and  state  training  and  workshops  as \nrequired.  They  will  consult  with  all  RCD  divisions  to  disseminate  the  concepts  of  the  sector \ndevelopment initiative.  \n \n57. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  TA  funding  program,  and  be \ncarried  out  by  an  international  consulting  firm,  to  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. International consulting inputs of 31 person-months are \nrequired (Appendix 11). The TA will be implemented from October 2008 to August 2009. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nInstitutional and Operational Improvements \n\nA. \n \nImproving management of the state road network through the institutional development \n58. \ncomponent  and  the  TA,  and  the  improvement  to  the  road  network  under  the  Project  will \nenhance overall road conditions and usability. This will increase travel speeds and reduce travel \ntime,  accidents,  and  overloading.  The  enhancement  of  RCD\u2019s  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment and management will improve road administration governance and accountability, \nand  create  an  environment  within  RCD  and  the  construction  industry  that  encourages \ncompetition  and  efficiency.  This  will  ensure  more  efficient  road  asset  development  and \nmanagement,  and  higher  quality  of  construction  and  maintenance,  resulting  in  decreased \nrecurrent  costs  over  the  medium  and  long  term.  This  will  lead  to  overall  social  and  economic \ndevelopment in Bihar. \n \nB. \n \n59. \nThe  approach  used  to  evaluate  the  Project  follows  the  standard  practice  of  comparing \nlife cycle road agency and user costs with and without the Project, using net present value with \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\na  12%  discount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.  The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  Model,  HDM-4,  was  used  for  the  analysis.  The \nanalysis focuses on transport cost savings. Value added from better transport links resulting in \nnew  industries  and  employment  are  not  quantified  in  this  analysis  but  are  captured  through \nbenefits to generated traffic. \n \n60. \nThe EIRR for the roads evaluated varies from 15% to 48%. The EIRR for three roads is \nbelow 20%, and for five roads is higher than 30%. The Project, which is for the state road sector \nrather  than  for  individual  roads,  is  very  robust  with  a  high  EIRR,  satisfying  the  economic \nefficiency criteria. \n \nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \n61. \ntest  cases  were  examined:  \nfollowing  sensitivity \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The \n(i) construction costs increase by 15%, (ii) no time is saved, (iii) benefits decrease by 15%, and \n(iv) generated traffic is reduced by 50% in addition to a combination of (i) and (iii). The results \nshow that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. Only two roads \nhave an EIRR slightly below 12% in the worst case scenario. These two roads serve relatively \nless-developed  areas  of  the  state  and  their  improvement  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \ndevelopment  of  these  areas.  Considering  their  positive  development  impact  and  the  fact  that \neven  in  the  worst  case  scenario,  they  have  an  EIRR  more  than  10%,  these  two  roads  are \nrecommended  for  implementation  under  the  Project  along  with  all  other  roads  included  in  the \nanalysis. Details of the economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC. \n \n62. \nRCD is currently undertaking a comprehensive road rehabilitation program to rehabilitate \nand upgrade 91% of state highways and 74% of MDRs in the next 5 years. During this period, \nthe funding requirement for maintenance is small compared to capital expenditure and can be \naccommodated  by  the  budget.  After  completion  of  the  rehabilitation  program,  sufficient  funds \nare  expected  to  be  available  for  all  recurrent  and  periodic  maintenance  work  of  the  upgraded \nstate highways and MDRs; total annual maintenance costs are likely to be less than 4% of the \nprojected GOB budget or 40% of the RCD budget. \n \nD. \n \n63. \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Social  Impact.  GOB  and  the  Planning  Commission  of  India \nestimate that 42.6% of Bihar\u2019s total population lives below the poverty line, which is highest in \nthe  country.  The  human  development  index,5 a  composite  of  literacy,  life  expectancy,  and  per \ncapita income, has increased for Bihar as in the rest of India. Bihar\u2019s rank among the states has \nremained unchanged at 15 since 1981. The human development index for Bihar was 0.267 in \n2001  in  comparison  to  the  national  value  of  0.472.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  was \nundertaken  during  project  preparation.  Agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  residents  in  the  project \nareas, with the majority deriving their livelihood from agriculture and labor (both agricultural and \nnonagricultural). By improving state roads, economic opportunities are expected to increase by \n(i)  enabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented  agricultural  surplus \nproduction; and (ii) helping local people, particularly rural youth, to work at better-paying jobs in \ntrading  and  other  new  jobs.  The  Project  will  indirectly  contribute  to  social  benefits  such  as \nimproved  access  to  health,  education,  and  social  services.  The  Project  will  have  a  short-term \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction  as  the  rural  poor  will  be  hired  for  construction,  tree  planting,  and \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n                                                 \n5   National Planning Commission, Government of India. 2001. National Human Development Report. New Delhi.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n\n \n\nensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly increase earnings of the poor who \nare largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nGender.  In  Bihar,  the  gender  ratio  of  the  population  is  921  females  for  every  1,000 \n64. \nmales  (2001  census).  The  literacy  rate  is  47.53%:  60.32%  for  males  and  33.57%  for  females \n(2001  census).  Focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women  belonging  to  different \nsocioeconomic groups in project influence areas. The majority of women work in the home and \noutside; the majority are consulted by their spouse and other family members prior to any family \ndecision. Improved road conditions will encourage better transport services, thereby improving \naccess for women and children to social services, markets, workplaces, higher education, better \nhealth facilities, and better employment opportunities for women and men.  \n\n65. \nHIV/AIDS.  India  is  on  the  brink  of  one  of  the  biggest  public  health  challenges  in  its \nhistory. The Government estimates that in 2006, about 2.45 million Indians were living with HIV \n(1.75 million\u20133.15 million) with an adult prevalence rate of 0.41%. According to India\u2019s National \nAIDS  Control  Organization,  HIV  infection  is  typically  concentrated  among  poor,  marginalized \ngroups,  including  sex  workers,  drug  users,  migrant  laborers,  and  truck  drivers  who  are \ncategorized  as  high-risk  groups.  These  groups,  particularly  truckers,  drive  the  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic and many studies indicate that infection is spreading rapidly to the general population. \nBihar  is  categorized  as  a  low  prevalence  state.  The  detailed  study  undertaken  during  project \npreparation did not anticipate any risks that HIV/AIDS would increase as a result of the Project. \nIn  addition,  state,  district,  and  block  campaigns  by  the  health  department  and  state  AIDS \nControl  Society  are  already  being  undertaken  to  increase  awareness  of  the  disease. \nInteractions  with  the  medical  health  officer,  AIDS  counsellors,  nongovernment  organizations, \nand  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  officers  in  the  project  areas  indicate  that  2\u20133  block \nawareness campaigns are organized each year to increase awareness of HIV and AIDS. RCD \nwill conduct awareness program of social aspects including HIV/AIDS in project areas for which \nGOB may engage an agency/nongovernment organization. \n \n66. \nIndigenous  People.  According  to  the  Census  of  India  2001,  Bihar  has  an  indigenous \npeople  population  of  758,351,  constituting  0.9%  of  the  state\u2019s  total  population  vis-\u00e0-vis  the \nnational percentage of 8.2%. Of the 38 districts in Bihar, 6 have no indigenous people members; \nin the rest, the indigenous people population varies from 0.1% to 5.9%. Katihar district has the \nhighest  proportion  of  indigenous  people  (5.9%),  followed  by  Jamui  (4.8%),  Banka  (4.7%),  and \nPurnia (4.4%). Sheohar district has the lowest proportion (0.01%), preceded by Darbhanga and \nKhagaria  (0.03%  each).  No  demarcated  indigenous  people  areas  are  located  in  the  project \narea.  Since  the  Project  entails  rehabilitating  existing  road  alignments,  the  social  assessments \nundertaken  have  revealed  limited  or  no  significant  impact  on  indigenous  people  groups  within \nthe  area  of  influence  of  the  project  roads.  Such  impacts  are  addressed  through  specific \nmeasures  for  indigenous  groups  embedded  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  assessment  also \nnotes  that  the  indigenous  people  members  in  the  project  area  have  been  mainstreamed  and \nassimilated  into  the  local  population.  The  study  undertaken  for  project  preparation  did  not \nindicate differential impacts between indigenous and non-indigenous groups in project locations. \nThe  improved  road  network  is  expected  to  augment  access  to  socioeconomic  facilities  of \nindigenous people groups along with other sections of the subproject population. Construction \nwill not have any adverse consequences for socioeconomic conditions or lead to any disruption \nin the community life or culture of these communities. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nResettlement Impacts. The Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the \n67. \nneed for land acquisition and resultant involuntary resettlement by means of adopting the most \nfeasible  technical  design.  In  addition,  the  Project  entails  rehabilitation  of  existing  state  roads, \nwhich  will  occur  within  the  available  right-of-way;  no  land  acquisition  will  be  required.  A  100% \ncensus  was  conducted  based  on  detailed  design  of  nine  roads.  Resettlement  plans  were \nprepared in accordance with the Government\u2019s National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy \n2007,  and  GOB\u2019s  Bihar  Land  Acquisition  Resettlement  &  Rehabilitation  Policy  2007,  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  ADB\u2019s  Operation  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary \nResettlement, for each road. Based on the census survey, all nine roads will have resettlement \nimpacts limited to nontitleholders as the proposed work is within the existing right-of-way. A total \nof  2,067  structures  will  be  affected  including  1,944  private  structures  (residential,  commercial, \nand mixed), 5 community structures, 78 religious structures, and 40 government structures and \nutilities.  Among  the  1,944  private  structures,  1,156  belong  to  encroachers,  784  belong  to \nsquatters, and 4 are owned by business license holders. The compensation entitled for the loss \nof structures at replacement value, shifting assistance, and other income restoration assistance \nis  detailed  in  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the  resettlement  plans.  Special  support  provisions  for \naffected people belonging to vulnerable groups, e.g., indigenous people groups, are included in \nthe resettlement plans. The total cost for resettlement for all nine subproject roads is estimated \nat Rs58 million. A summary of the resettlement plans is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nE. \n \n68. \nThe  Project  is  classified  \"B\"  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB  environmental \nassessment  requirements.  Therefore,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  prepared \nfor  the  nine  subprojects.  The  summary  of  the  IEE  reports  provides  a  brief  description  of \nenvironmental  conditions  of  the  project-affected  areas,  a  summary  of  potential  environmental \nimpacts,  and  the  recommended  mitigation  measures.  The  summary  IEE  is  attached  as \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  and  will  be  disclosed  simultaneously  with  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President.  \n \n69. \nThe  findings  of  the  IEEs  indicate  that  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. The impacts mainly occur during construction and are mostly temporary. \nThe main causes are land clearing for widening the carriageway, earthwork involving cut and fill, \nand  quarrying  and  transportation  of  construction  materials  to  support  construction  activities. \nDuring the operation, direct local impacts are mostly related to road accidents. The IEE reports \ndetail  proposed  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  these  adverse  impacts.  They  include \nenvironmental  management  plans  to  guide  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  by \ncontractors, supervision consultant, and RCD through its PMU (to be assisted by a consultant). \nThe  PMU  with  the  assistance  of  a  consultant  and  in  close  consultation  with  relevant  state \nagencies, such as the Forest Department and Bihar Pollution Control Board, will be responsible \nfor carrying out environmental monitoring and preparing an environmental monitoring report on \nbehalf of RCD.   \n \nF. \n \n70. \nA recent sector assistance program evaluation identified issues for state road projects in \nIndia,  including  (i)  initial  delays  in  implementation,  (ii)  risk  of  incomplete  network  development \nbecause of avoiding areas that require major involuntary resettlement and are environmentally \nsensitive, (iii) appropriateness of sector development framework, and (iv) a need for government \nto efficiently and effectively secure the maintenance budget.  \n \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\nThe risk of initial delays has already been mitigated through RCD\u2019s advance actions and \n71. \nsupport  provided  by  ADB  for  full  compliance  with  requirements.  Training  on  safeguard \nrequirements  was  provided  to  RCD  staff  to  mitigate  the  potential  risk  of  initial  delays  due  to \nprocedural clearance. \n \n72. \nProject  roads  were  identified  in  accordance  with  the  state  highway  development \nprogram.  The  Project  will  minimize  or  nullify  any  negative  social  and  environmental  impacts \nthrough appropriate engineering design. \n \n73. \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated by reflecting the state \ncontext in the institutional strengthening action plan by taking into account the rather short-term \nproject  duration,  actions  taken  by  GOB,  and  the  policy  framework  of  Bihar  Road  Sector \nDevelopment\u2013New Dimensions (footnote 2). \n \n74. \nGOB has increased its maintenance budget to meet requirements and obtained the full \ngrants-in-aide provided by the Government\u2019s under the 12th Finance Commission by providing \nadequate  funds  under  the  nonplan  budget.  The  risk  of  underutilization  of  the  maintenance \nbudget is low based on the recent year\u2019s high utilization, resulting from RCD\u2019s strict monitoring \nsystems for project implementation. \n \nFiduciary  risks  are  addressed  by  adopting  international  best  practices  in  procurement \n75. \nwith  ADB  prior  review;  and  parallel  support  by  the  World  Bank  and  DFID  in  improving  public \nfinancial management, governance, and anticorruption initiatives.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOB  have  given  the \n\n76. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n77. \nImplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  GOB  provides  timely  and  adequate \ncounterpart funds and facilities for the Project, including the funds needed for implementing the \nenvironmental  management  plans  and  resettlement  plans,  and  any  cost  overruns  in  respect \nthereof. \n \n78. \nThe Government will ensure that GOB implements the institutional strengthening action \nplan,  utilizing  the  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  Bihar \nRoad Sector during project implementation. \n \n79. \nimplementation of the environmental management plans and resettlement plans. \n \n80. \nRoad  Maintenance  Financing.

The Government through GOB shall cause RCD to ensure \nthat (i) the Project is implemented in accordance with the Government\u2019s National Rehabilitation \nand  Resettlement  Policy  2007,  GOB\u2019s  Bihar  Land  Acquisition  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation \nPolicy  2007,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Policy \n(1998),  and  the  resettlement  plans;  (ii)  all  affected  people  are  given  adequate  opportunity  to \nparticipate  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation;  (iii)  the  resettlement  plans  are \ndisclosed to the affected people, who are compensated and assisted prior to displacement from \ntheir houses, land, and assets; and before commencement of civil works in the relevant section \nof  the  project  road;  (iv)  affected  people  receive  priority  for  wage  employment  in  project \nconstruction; (v) additional assistance is provided for vulnerable groups; (vi) resettlement plans \nare updated, if necessary, in course of project implementation, disclosed to the affected people, \nand submitted to ADB for approval and disclosure on its website; (vii) civil works contracts under \nthe Project include requirements to comply with the resettlement plans; (viii) implementation of \nthe  resettlement  plans  is  monitored  (a)  internally  by  the  project  implementation  units  and \nreported  monthly  to  the  PMU,  which  shall  report  the  results  quarterly  to  ADB,  and  (b) \nindependently  by  an  expert  under  the  construction  supervision  consultant  and  reported \nbiannually directly to ADB; and (ix) affected people have an opportunity to express grievance at \nappropriate  levels,  and  that  local  officials  are  instructed  to  resolve  disputes  and  implement \nmeasures promptly. \n \n85. \nHIV/AIDS,  Human  Trafficking,  and  Child  Labor.  GOB  shall  conduct  awareness \nprogram  in  respect  of  HIV/AIDs,  human  trafficking,  and  child  labor  in  project  areas  for  which \nGOB may engage an agency/nongovernment organization. RCD will ensure that the civil works \ncontracts under the Project incorporate provisions to the effect that the contractor is required to \n(i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for  labor;  (ii)  disseminate  information  at  worksites \non risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures \nfor those employed during construction; and (iii) follow and implement all statutory provisions on \nlabor  (including  equal  pay  for  equal  work  and  non-employment  of  child  labor),  health,  safety, \nwelfare, sanitation, and working conditions. The civil works contract will provide for termination \nof  the  contracts  by  GOB  and  RCD  in  case  of  breach  of  any  of  the  said  provisions  by  the \ncontractors. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n86. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$420,000,000  to  India  for  the  Bihar  State  Highways  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n27 August 2008\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nIncreased \neconomic growth \nin Bihar \n \n\nOutcome \nEnhanced road \ntransport \nefficiency and \nsafety \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicators \n\n \nContribution of road transport to \nthe state gross domestic \nproduct (1.7% in 2006) \nincreased to 3.5% by 2015 \n \n \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nNational and state \nsocioeconomic data \nand statistics \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement \n \nData collected through \nthe road asset \nmanagement system \n \nSocial and household \nsurvey \n \nProject performance \nmonitoring system  \n\n \nActual growth rates of traffic on \nproject roads surpasses \nassumed growth rates, e.g., 8% \nfor cars  \n \nVehicle operating costs on \nproject roads reduced by 30% \nfor two-axle trucks (from the \ncurrent average of Rs19/km) \nand by 35% for passenger \nbuses (from the current \naverage of Rs21/km) by \ncompletion \n \nTravel time on project roads \nreduced by an average of 40% \n(speed increased from current \naverage of 35 km/hour to 60 \nkm/hour) by completion \n \nAccess of the rural poor to \nsocial services, markets, and \nother economic activities \nimproved (e.g., number of daily \ntrips by the rural poor increased \nby 50% by 2012) \n \nAt project completion, accident \nrate (fatalities by vehicle-km) \nreduced by 20% from 2008 rate \n \nProject roads maintained with \nInternational Roughness Index \nbelow 5 from over 10 at \nappraisal \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n19\n\n \nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumption \n\u2022  Various government \n\ndevelopment activities are \neffectively coordinated \nwith road sector \ninvestment. \n\n \nRisk \n\u2022  Roadside small \n\nbusinesses lose business \nopportunities due to \nincreased efficiency and \nspeed of vehicle travel.  \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Delivery of the project is \n\ntimely. \n\n\u2022  The state allocates \n\nsufficient maintenance \nbudget to be eligible for \ngrants-in-aid available \nduring FY2005\u2013FY2009 \nas provided by the 12th \nFinance Commission \nruling. \n\n\u2022  Funds allocated for \n\nmaintenance works are \nfully utilized. \n\n\u2022  Transport modes and \n\nservices are available for \nthe project roads \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nOutputs \n1.

It  is  surrounded  by  Uttar  Pradesh  (west),  Jharkhand  (south),  West  Bengal  (east), \nand Nepal (north). The state has a rich history and cultural tradition, making it a major religious \nand tourist destination. \n \n2. \nWhile  an  extensive  and  well-developed  rail  system  passes  through  Bihar  and \nconsiderable  potential  exists  for  development  and  utilization  of  inland  waterways,  rapid \ndevelopment and strengthening of the road network will provide momentum for accelerating the \nprocess of economic development. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  road  network  in  Bihar  in  2007  is  described  in  Table  A2.1.  Not  all  roads  are  of  the \nsame  type  in  terms  of  either  width  or  quality.  Most  of  the  higher  class  of  roads  have  been \nprovided  with  a  sealed  (bitumen  or  concrete)  surface  while  the  less  important  ones  remain \nunsealed (metalled or gravel). \n \n\nRoad Network and Traffic \n\nTable A2.1: Roads in Bihar \n(kilometers) \n\nClass of Road \n\nNo. \n1. \nNational Highways \nState Highways \n2. \n3.

Updated \nfor national highways, state highways, and major district roads. \n\n \n\n4. \nThe carrying capacity of a road is governed by its carriageway width. Nearly 70% of state \nhighways and 80% of the major district roads (MDRs) are single lane (Table A2.2). Of national \nhighways, 45% have not been improved to two or more lanes. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Distribution of Roads by Carriageway Width (%) \n\nSingle \nLane \n20 \n71 \n83 \n  Source: Bihar Road Construction Department. \n\nClass of Road \nNo. \n1.

The road density in Bihar is only 901 kilometers (km) per million population compared \nwith the national average of 2,567. About half of villages lack all-weather road connectivity. Most \nroads  have  poor  riding quality,  poor  geometry,  weak  pavement,  and  inadequate capacity;  and \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAsset Management of State Roads \n\nlack  bridges.  The  result  is  high  transport  costs  and  excessive  travel  time.  A  major  part  of  the \nnetwork is almost not usable. \n \n6. \nVehicle registrations increased from 0.95 million in 2000/01 to 1.56 million in 2006/07, an \nannual  averaging  increase  of  8.6%.  The  highest  increase  was  2-wheelers;  excluding  the  2-\nwheelers,  the  increase  is  5.5%.  Trucks  increased  at  a  very  low  rate,  whereas  tractors  and \ntrailers have increased more quickly. This may be mainly due to the poor road network, where \ntractors  and  trailers  are  preferred  for  transporting  goods,  especially  agricultural  produce\u2014\nagriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the  rural  economy.  The  number  of  trucks,  especially  multiaxle \ntrailers, is expected to increase once the road conditions and network are improved.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nBihar  Road  Construction  Department  (RCD)  is  responsible  for  state  highways,  MDRs, \nand national highways approved and funded by the Government of India (the Government). Of \nthe  3,700  km  of  national  highways  in  Bihar,  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  is \nresponsible  for  800  km.  The  Government  recently  approved  upgrading  890  km  of  national \nhighways  to  four  lanes  under  the  National  Highway  Development  Program  III  using  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT).  Roads  that  GOB  identifies  for  development  on  a  BOT  basis  are \nentrusted  to  India  Infrastructure  Finance  Company  and  Infrastructure  Development  Finance \nCompany  to  structure  and  implement  the  projects.  District  councils  and  the  Rural  Works \nDepartment  are  responsible  for  ODRs  and  village  roads.  The  Rural  Works  Department  is \nresponsible  for  the  chief  minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  Mukhya  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(MMGSY),  which  connects  habitations  with  populations  of  500\u2013999,  in  parallel  with  the \nnationwide  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(PMGSY),  which  gives  priority  to  connectivity  for  habitations  with  populations  of  more  than \n1,000. The chief minister\u2019s rural roads program follows the basic principles and incorporates the \ngood  practices  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  but  employs  more  decentralized \nadministrative  and  technical  sanction  procedures,  and  utilizes  a  separate  set  of  guidelines  for \nproject selection. \n \n8. \nRCD  is  responsible  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  roads  on  behalf  of  GOB.  The \nengineer-in-chief  is  the  technical  head  of  the  department  and  professional  advisor  to  GOB  on \npolicy  and  implementation  related  to  road  construction.  The  engineer-in-chief  reports  to  the \nRCD  principal  secretary.  RCD  is  organized  with  four  wings,  which  are  responsible  for \nconstruction  and  maintenance  of  roads  (north  Bihar,  south  Bihar,  national  highway,  special \nproject).  The  wings  are  headed  by  chief  engineers  who  are  responsible  for  implementation  of \npolicy and overall supervision of RCD administration. \n \n9. \nUnder  each  wing  are  circle  offices  headed  by  superintending  engineers.  Under  every \ncircle  are  divisions,  headed  by  executive  engineers.  They  are  the  basic  operations  units  and \nexecutive engineers are responsible for management of works including contracts and payment \nfor works. In every division, subdivisions are headed by assistant engineers who manage and \nsupervise  works  within  their  subdivision.  This  involves  design  and  contract  management \nincluding quality control and testing. Assistant engineers are required to check the quality and \nquantity  (measurement)  of  works.  Under  every  subdivision  are  sections  headed  by  junior \nengineers  who  are  the  basic  field  functionaries  and  responsible  for  managing  actual \nconstruction  activity  in  the  field,  taking  measurements,  giving  day-to-day  guidance,  and \nreporting to the assistant engineer. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nRoad Transport Regulation and Industry \n\nIn  addition, there  are  wings  in  charge  of  surveys  and  planning  (advance  plan);  design, \n10. \ntraining,  and  research  (central  design  office);  monitoring  implementation  (supervision),  and \nmaintaining RCD equipment including machinery for roads (mechanical). RCD has divisions in \ncharge  of  procurement  (headed  by  a  director)  and  transport  (headed  by  a  special  officer), \ncentrally operated under the engineer-in-chief. \n \n11. \nThe  existing  RCD  headquarters  organization  meets  the  assigned  requirements.  The \nmechanical wing functions well, and is equipped with adequate machines and compactors. The \nBihar State Bridge Construction Corporation effectively undertakes all major bridge works in the \nstate.  However,  the  capacity  of  RCD  for  core  processes  requires  strengthening  and \nreorganization, especially in the areas of policy making, planning, and programming. No training \ninstitutes  are  available  to  train  contractors  and  RCD  personnel  to  improve  their  skills  in \nconstruction management. \n \nC. \n \nThe Bihar Transport Department is responsible for licensing, registration, and regulation \n12. \nof motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and freight transport; as well as road safety policy and \nenforcing  axle-load  regulations.  It  has  started  to  address  controlling  overloading  and  installing \nsix  weigh  stations  at  entry  points  into  the  state.  Installation  of  additional  weighbridges  is \nplanned.  Traffic  police,  under  the  Home  Department,  are  responsible  for  enforcing  traffic  and \nroad  safety  regulations.  The  Transport  Department  is  headed  by  principal  secretary  and  its \nfunctions are designed in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The \nprincipal  legislation  and  regulations  affecting  the  functioning  of  the  department  are  the  Motor \nVehicles  Act,  1988;  Central  Motor  Vehicles  Rules,  1989;  Bihar  Motor  Vehicles  Rules,  1992; \nBihar Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1994; Bihar Motor Vehicles Tax Rules, 1994; Bengal Ferries \nAct  and  rules;  and  Inland  Vessels  Act,  1917.  The  principal  functions  of  the  department  are \nrevenue  collection;  registration  of  vehicles;  issuance  of  permits;  inspection  of  vehicles  and \nenforcement  of  penalties  under  various  central  and  state  laws  and  regulations;  monitoring, \nimplementing, and coordinating interstate and interregional transport arrangements; prevention \nof  vehicular  pollution  and  enforcement  of  relevant  regulations;  and  maintenance  of  statistical \ndata for the use of the central and state governments and transport organizations. \n \n13. \nThe state-owned Bihar State Road Transport Corporation provides intra- and interstate \nbus  services  with  about  350  buses,  i.e.,  about  2%\u20133%  of  buses  operated  in  the  state.  It  is \ncurrently  restructuring  in  line  with  the  state  program.  Buses  are  replaced  with  new  ones,  and \nfleet utilization, bus productivity, and effective operation kilometers are being improved. Most of \nthese  efficiency  parameters  are  also  expected  to  be  improved  as  a  result  of  improving  road \nconditions. GOB grants permission to contract and private buses to use the same routes as the \nState Road Transport Corporation. GOB authorized the corporation to fix fares based on sound \nbusiness  principles.  Private  bus  operators  adopt  different  fares  based  on  demand  for  specific \nroutes.  Truck  hire  rates  are  fixed  by  market  demand.  Competition  is  good.  Private  sector \noperators provide most of the services for passenger and freight transport.  \n \nD. \n \nBudgetary  expenditure  for  state  roads  in  2006/07  was  Rs1,974  crore 1 ($506  million) \n14. \ncompared with the original budget of Rs2,147 crore ($551 million). In 2006/07, the budget is 2.8 \ntimes  larger  than  the  previous  year\u2019s  Rs648  crore  ($171  million)  due  to  the  new  state \n\nRoad Expenditures and Revenues \n\n                                                 \n1 A crore is equal to 10,000,000. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ngovernment\u2019s  high  priority  for  road  rehabilitation  and  development,  supported  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s grant fund (Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana). The extent of underspending was only \n8%  of  the  original  budget.  This  demonstrates  remarkable  improvement  in  RCD\u2019s  capacity  and \ncommitment to deliver. The 2007/08 budget increased to Rs2,378.85 crore ($610 million).

The \naverage  annual  increase  is  very  high  at  20%  due  to  improved  vehicle  registration  and  tax \npayments. In addition, road users pay commercial sales taxes such as for vehicles, fuel, tires, \nand  spare  parts.  The  Transport  Department  is  one  of  the  major  resource-generating \ndepartments along with the commercial tax, registration, and excise departments. \n \nE. \n \n16. \nThe state\u2019s road network is very poor in terms of coverage and conditions. Demand for \nroad transport is increasing. Insufficient funding to road maintenance in the past has increased \nthe  number  of  roads  that  are  beyond  maintainable  condition  and  the  backlog  of  deferred \nmaintenance. GOB has taken on the State Highway Development Program to rehabilitate and \nupgrade state highways to at least 2 lanes, and expand the state highway network by upgrading \nMDRs to 2 lanes. The program covers upgrading 2,831 km of the 3,127 km of state highways \nduring  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  period  through  various  schemes,  including  the  Government-\nsupported RSVY, BOT schemes, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. \n \n17. \nGOB  also  takes  on  sector  development  initiatives  in  the  framework  specified  in  Bihar \nRoad  Sector  Development\u2013New  Dimensions 2  to  develop  and  sustain  the  road  network  by \nmodernizing  road  agencies;  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  road  financing; \n\n                                                 \n2   Government of India. 2007.

Currently  RCD  is  in  charge  of  all  state  roads,  e.g.,  state  highways  and  MDRs, \nirrespective of strategic importance requiring priority improvement and maintenance. \n \n19. \nApproaches identified by the Bihar road sector development strategy (footnote 2) include \n(i)  harnessing  private  sector  structures  and  skills  to  meet  public  demand  for  infrastructure;  \n(ii)  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  road  financing;  and  (iii)  outsourcing  functions  of \nproject  preparation,  design,  construction,  construction  supervision,  and  quality  audit  to  private \nentities. This would leave government functionaries with the limited but important responsibility \nof  policy  development  and  management  oversight,  and  improving  accountability  concentrating \non performance monitoring and output, rather than the day-to-day running of public services. \n \n20. \nFor this purpose, RCD initially outsourced works of upgrading old state highways under \nRSVY  with  Rs3,000  crores  ($790  million)  to  other  road  implementation  agencies,  targeting \ncompletion by 2008/09. Work on the remaining 1,554 km, of newly declared state highways, is \nproposed  to  be  implemented  with  international  best  practices  with  ADB  financing,  adopting \nFIDIC3-based contract management and international competitive bidding procedures. GOB has \nbeen discussing potential BOT projects for 500 km of national highways with India Infrastructure \nFinance Company and Infrastructure Development Finance Company. \n \n21. \nFor long-term frameworks, it is often effective to split the functions of road development \npolicy/programming,  and  project  implementation.  While  the  government  would  determine  the \nextent,  an  autonomous  body  like  a  highway  authority  or  road  development  corporation  would \nexecute  the  project,  e.g.,  project  preparation,  design,  bidding,  and  contract  awards  and \nmanagement.  This  will  ensure  efficient  decision  making  for  program  implementation  and  help \nbuild  up  expertise  in  outsourcing  technical  work,  understanding  FIDIC,  other  new  forms  of \ncontracts, and public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n22. \nRCD  is  considering  setting  up  a  state  road  and  highway  development  authority  to \nstreamline decision-making and provide more autonomy for project execution and delivery. This \nrequires  redefining  powers,  functions,  and  accountability  of  road  agencies.  The  established \nproject management unit of the ADB project is considered an embryo cell to be expanded and \nstrengthened to be an autonomous authority for state road development and maintenance. \n \nAll right-of-way management authority is currently with police and revenue departments, \n23. \nand  managing  encroachments  requires  time,  resulting  in  time  and  cost  overruns  for  road \nprojects. Well-defined right-of-way and asset management authority should be placed with RCD \nengineers to provide long-term benefits of road development planning. \n\n                                                 \n3 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n2. \n\nBusiness Procedures \n\n \n24. \nRCD  undertakes  businesses  in  accordance  with  the  1958  Bihar  Public  Works \nDepartment Code. Layers of approval for project sanctioning are required, which takes time for \nproject approval and payment to contractors. GOB recently amended the code to delegate more \nsanctioning power with increased financial amount to field offices, which helps expedite project \nimplementation. RCD\u2019s sector management capability was significantly strengthened during the \nlast one and half years. Major actions taken by RCD include streamlining bidding procedures, \nquality control, asset management, and project management. \n \n25. \nProcurement and Bidding Documents. For procurement and subsequent execution of \nworks,  outdated  performance  standards  resulted  in  very  poor  quality  of  the  road  network.  No \nmechanism  was  available  to  measure  contractor  performance.  RCD  developed  standard \nbidding  documents  for  civil  works  in  2006  to  streamline  procurement  procedures.  For  larger \ncontract  packages,  such  as  those  under  ADB  financing,  it  adopts  FIDIC  contracts  and \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. \n \n26. \nQuality  Control. A 2\u20133 year performance guarantee and/or defect liability are included \nin contracts. Laboratory equipment is being enhanced, and mobile quality control squads are set \nup in all district offices. A third-party quality control system has been introduced. \n \n27. \nAsset  Management.  A  geographic  information  system-linked  database  of  road \ninventory  and  work  history  is  currently  being  prepared.  At  the  same  time,  a  new  asset \nmanagement  system  is  being  set  up,  which  plans  the  budget  under  headings  of  routine \nmaintenance,  periodic  maintenance,  widening/strengthening,  and  resurfacing.  This  will  help \ndevelop optimal allocations of the road budget for development and maintenance.   \n \nProject  Management  and  Monitoring.  RCD  introduced  penalty  and  bonus  clauses  in \n28. \ncontracts to motivate completion of projects on time. To implement the system, RCD introduced \nstrict  monitoring  systems  of  work  progress.  This  will  be  connected  online  between  all  field \noffices and headquarters by the end of this fiscal year. Accounting officers for the field offices \nwere deputed from the accountant general\u2019s office to ensure appropriate recording of financial \nmatters.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Maintenance Financing \n\n \n29. \nThe  nonplan  budget  increased  from  Rs201  crore  ($52  million)  in  2003/04  to  \nRs311  crore  ($80  million)  in  2006/07,  an  annual  increase  of  15.6%.  The  maintenance \nrequirement  until  completion  of  the  State  Highway  Development  Program  is  not  high  as  most \nstate highways and MDRs will be upgraded under the program. After the program, the budget \nrequirement  for  maintenance  will  be  increased  and  is  estimated  at  Rs420  crore  ($108  million) \nannually.  Revenue  relating  to  road  use  is  estimated  at  Rs308  crore  ($79  million)  in  2005/06, \nexcluding  excise,  with  historical  increase  of  20%  per  annum.  This  matches  maintenance \nrequirements and is absorbed in the general government revenue. \n \n30. \nEfficiency of the use of nonplan budget has improved. The share of salaries and wages \nin  the  nonplan  budget  reduced  from  43%  in  2003/04  to  36%  in  2006/07.  This  demonstrates \nGOB\u2019s increased commitment to maintenance and efficiency of road maintenance. Considering \npast budgetary provisions and trends, GOB is assessed as adequately providing maintenance \nfinancing in a sustainable manner. Increased maintenance quality due to introduction of 5-year \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  maintenance  works \nand  reduce  maintenance  costs.  GOB  has  provided  assurance  that  it  will  provide  adequate \nfinancing to maintain state highways developed with ADB financing.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n31. \nBihar has a higher accident rate (17.3 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles between 2001 and \n2004) than the national average (12.8 in 2003), and the rate is expected to increase as traffic \ngrows.  One  of  the  major  causes  of  accidents  is  lack  of  awareness  and  knowledge  of  traffic \nrules. To enhance awareness of traffic rules, the Transport Department organizes a road safety \nweek every year for school children and the public. In Patna and major district centers including \nrural areas, the Transport Department undertakes inspection missions to ensure people follow \ntraffic  rules.  GOB  is  planning  to  establish  state  and  district  road  safety  councils  to  provide \nguidance on road safety. \n \n32. \nRCD will develop a road safety unit within its organization to institutionalize road safety \naudits, ensuring safety elements of India Roads Congress standards are incorporated in design \nand during construction. \n \n33. \nIn  1996,  the  Government  recommended  establishing  a  directorate  of  safety  and  traffic \nmanagement  and  set  up  a  road  safety  fund  allocating  1%  of  cess  revenue  for  national \nhighways.  An  expert  committee  at  the  Ministry  of  Sipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways  will \nreview  these  recommendations  and  finalize  a  road  safety  policy  to  address  legal,  institutional, \nand  financial  issues  for  road  safety.  This  will  provide  a  new  context  for  the  funding  and \ninstitutional setup for state road safety. \n \n\n5. \n\nOverloading \n\n \nOverloading is a nationwide problem and the number of multiaxle trailers is increasing. \n34. \nOverloaded  trucks  are  expected  to  increase  on  major  Bihar  highways  in  accordance  with \neconomic growth. An overloading control program being set up comprises 43 actions, such as \nmultilane  weighbridge  installation  with  separate  lanes  for  small  vehicles,  officers  residing  at \ncheck  posts,  computerized  processing  and  networking,  and  smart-card-based  systems  for \nverification  and  payment.  Initially,  six  weighbridges  are  being  installed  at  state  border  points, \nand  more  are  planned.  Strict  enforcement  of  the  regulation,  e.g.,  practicing  off-loading  of \noverloaded trucks, will be undertaken in coordination with the police. \n \n\n6. \n\nVehicle Pollution Control \n\n \n35. \nTo support a clean environment, GOB amended the 1992 Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules to \nrequire  all  vehicles  to  have  a  pollution  control  certificate.  All  vehicles  must  undergo  pollution \nchecks  to  obtain  the  certificate.  While  it  continues  to  establish  permanent  pollution  check \ncenters, GOB is encouraging the private sector to develop centers and has given permission for \n103  so  far.  GOB  has  established  centers  in  21  of  the  38  districts  in  the  state.  Emission  test \nmachines are now required for each center.  \n \n\n7. \n\nConstruction Industry \n\n \nThe  proposed  large  programs  require  good  construction  firms  equipped  with  adequate \n36. \ntechnical personnel and modern construction machinery. In the absence of regular work in the \npast,  the  state\u2019s  construction  industry  has  become  weak;  only  a  few  contractors  are  from \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\noutside the state. Local contractors have difficulty mobilizing the necessary financial resources \nto even bid and subsequently implement the works. \n \n37. \nA local construction industry can develop around a large program if work is seen to be \navailable  on  a  regular  basis  over  a  long  time.  Initially,  local  agencies  could  associate  with \nqualified  construction  firms  from  outside  the  state,  and  acquire  the  necessary  technical  and \nmanagerial skills to subsequently qualify on their own. Good contractors from outside the state \nwill  invest  their  resources  only  if  they  perceive  a  good  opportunity  in  terms  of  contract  size. \nUnder the Project, GOB made the contracts as large as possible to attract qualified bidders. \n \n38. \nThe infrastructure equipment bank, QUIPO, was set up to lease construction equipment \nto local contractors, starting with the first three branches at Bhagalpur, Muzaffapur, and Patna. \nThis will help expedite the process of road construction in the state. RCD simplified contractor \nregistration rules to reduce barriers to entry to help increase competition between contractors, \nand hence increase quality and reduce cost. \n \n39. \nstrengthening

and (b) will not be denied registration for reasons \nunrelated  to  their  capability  and  resources  to  successfully  perform  the  contract, \nwhich will be verified through postqualification. \nForeign suppliers  and contractors from ADB member countries will be allowed to \nbid, without registration, licensing, and other government authorizations. However, \nif  these  foreign  suppliers  and  contractors  are  declared  the  winning  bidders,  the \nrequirements may be completed after award and before signing of the contract, \nwithout unreasonable costs or additional requirements. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nAdvertising \n\nBidding  of  NCB  contracts  estimated  at  $1,000,000  or  more  for  goods  and  related \n\n3. \nservices will be advertised on the ADB website concurrent with general procurement notices. \n \n\nProcuring entities will use standard bidding documents acceptable to ADB, based ideally \n\n4. \n\nBidding Documents \n\n \n4. \non the standard bidding documents issued by ADB. \n \n \n \n5. \nequivalent of ADB\u2019s single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. \n \n\nTwo-Bid System \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nBidding Period \n\n \n6. \n\nProcuring entities will allow a minimum of 4 weeks for submission of bids. \n\nThe  two-bid  system  as  applied  for  the  procurement  of  goods  will  be  considered  the \n\n7. \n\nBid Security \n\n7. \nWhere required, bid security will be in the form of a bank guarantee from a reputable \nbank and should normally be about 2% of the estimated value of the contract to be procured. \nThe bid security must remain valid for not more than 30 days after the final bid validity period. \n\n \n\nPreferences \n\n8. \nNo  preference  will  be  given  to  domestic  bidders  or  for  domestically  manufactured \n8. \ngoods  such  as  those  manufactured  by  small-scale  industrial  units,  government  corporations, \nand private companies operating in India. \n\n9. \n\nPrice Negotiations \n\n \n9. \nPrice  negotiation  will  be  allowed  only  where  the  price  offered  by  the  lowest  evaluated \nand  substantially  responsive  bidder  substantially  exceeds  costs  estimates.

The focus of the technical assistance (TA) is to (i) redefine and restructure the Road \nConstruction  Department  (RCD)  as  a  state-of-the-art  road  agency,  and  (ii)  implement  new \nbusiness  procedures  and  provide  training  to  RCD  officials  to  enable  RCD  to  adopt  a  new \ninstitutional  and  management  structure.  New  business  procedures  will  cover  (i)  procurement \nand  contracting  processes, \n(iii)  quality  assurance  systems,  \n(iv) engineering (pavement design, maintenance methods, and safety), and (v) human resource \nmanagement. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  consultants  will  undertake  the  services  in  close  consultation  with  the  principal \nsecretary  and  engineer-in-chief,  RCD.  They  will  conduct  state  and  district  training  and \nworkshops as required. RCD-wide consultation will be conducted to disseminate the concepts of \nthe sector development initiative.  \n \n3. \nFor  a  long-term  framework,  splitting  the  functions  of  road  development  policy  and \nprogramming  from  project  implementation  is  often  effective.  While  the  government  would \ndetermine  the  extent,  an  autonomous  body  like  a  state  highway  authority  (SHA)  or  road \ninfrastructure  corporation  (RIC)  would  execute  the  project,  e.g.,  project  preparation,  design, \nbidding, contract awards, and management. This will ensure efficient decision making for project \nimplementation  and  help  build  up  expertise  in  outsourcing  of  technical  work,  understanding \nFIDIC,1 using  new  forms  of  contracts,  and  developing  public\u2013private  partnerships.  For  these \nterms of reference, the newly modernized RCD is, in any form, named as the SHA/RIC. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe consultant will be expected to undertake the following tasks: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRecommend an appropriate institutional structure for managing the overall state road \nnetwork, including state highways and major district roads. \nRecommend  appropriate  management  structures  for  managing  each  layer  of  the \nroad network. \nReview  existing  and  draft  laws  and  acts  being  prepared  for  Bihar  and  examples  in \nother  states  and  countries;  and  use  these  to  develop  a  draft  highway  act, \nincorporating  adequate  provision  for  concession  arrangements  like  public\u2013private \npartnerships for consideration by GOB.  \nRecommend and implement new business procedures, and provide training to RCD \nstaff  to  enable  restructuring  and  adoption  of  a  new  institutional  and  management \nstructure. \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework  \n\n \n5. \nThe main task of the consultants is to seek agreement from various groups involved on \nhow  roads  are  to  be  administered.  They  will  be  expected  to  (i)  examine  if  SHA  and/or  RIC \n\n                                                 \n1 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45\n\nremain  responsible  for  all  state  highways  and  major  district  roads,  or  be  dedicated  to \nstrategically  important  roads  with  other  roads  left  for  RCD;  (ii)  identify  functions  and  powers \nRCD  and/or  SHA  and/or  RIC  require  for  effective  corridor  management;  and  (iii)  identify  and \nstructure  for  SHA  and/or  RIC  to  be  able  to  work  as  a  project  implementation  agency  for \ndedicated roads, e.g., strategically important roads. \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement Structures  \n\n \nThe  institutional  analysis  should  determine  how  each  part  of  the  road  network  is  to  be \n6. \nmanaged.  The  task  following  is  to  recommend  appropriate  organization  and  management \nstructures  for  SHA/RIC.  The  intention  is  to  do  most  road  works  under  contract.  RCD  and \nSHA/RIC should thus be primarily staffed to plan and manage the road network, and to hire and \nsupervise consultants and contractors to carry out any required civil works. In this connection, \nthe consultant will be expected to undertake the following: \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(including \n\nfor  a  management  board \n\nRecommend  an  appropriate  organization  structure  for  SHA/RIC,  including  the \nfunctions,  composition,  and \nneed \nremuneration  of  members).  Recommend  the  management  structure,  e.g.,  chief \nexecutive  officer  (CEO)  and  line  managers,  and  develop  procedures  for \nappointing  the  CEO  and,  if  necessary,  the  deputy  CEO;  and  the  relationship \nbetween other line departments, the board, and the CEO.  \nDefine  the  middle-management  structure.  Arrangements  should  articulate  the \nregional  structure  of  the  proposed  organization.  Proposals  should  indicate  the \nmiddle management structure, how it relates to the CEO, and appropriate terms \nand conditions for staff employment for staff to ensure the agency can attract and \nretain suitably qualified staff. \nPropose  suitable  financial  reporting  and  accounting  arrangements.  Proposals \nshould  include  recommended  formats  for  simple  accounts  to  help  SHA/RIC \nmaintain effective financial control; including identification of costs by activity and \nproject;  and  preparation  of  a  consolidated  income  statement,  partial  balance \nsheet, and cash flow statement. Advise on the most appropriate way of reflecting \nshortfalls in regular road maintenance and erosion of capital in the accounts.  \nPropose  (a)  arrangements  for  establishing  a  performance-based  budgeting \nsystem for planning, implementing, and monitoring road maintenance; and (b) an \nappropriate auditing system, including internal audit and control procedures, with \nindependent external audit arrangements.  \nRecommend how SHA/RIC should deal with planning and management of road \nnetworks. \nIdentify  arrangements  needed  for  the  unclassified  road  network.  Determine  if  a \nform  of  cost-sharing  arrangement  would  encourage  local  communities  to  take \nownership. When they agree to take ownership of these roads, tracks, and trails, \nidentify  how  to  register  their  commitment  and  provide  advice  and  technical \nassistance.  Identify  arrangements  to  ensure  the  funds  allocated  from  the  road \nfund are used effectively. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nHighway Act \n\n \n7. \nThe  consultant  will  be  expected  to  review  draft  laws  being  prepared  for  Bihar  and \nexamples  from  other  states  and  countries,  and  taking  into  account  the  work  specified  in  the \nterms  of  reference,  to  prepare  a  draft  highway  act.  The  bill  should  be  divided  into  sections \ndealing with the following: \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  general  responsibilities  of  RCD  and  GOB  with  regard  to  classifying  roads, \nassigning  them  to  a  legally  constituted  SHA/RIC,  promulgating  authorized  road \nsigns and signals, setting appropriate geometric standards for road construction, \nissuing  notices  regarding  regulation  of  roads  and  road  traffic  (e.g.,  governing \nvehicle weight and dimensions), delegating administration of responsibilities to a \ndesignated SHA/RIC, and initiating research on matters related to roads.  \nThe detailed responsibilities of SHA/RIC, including the role (if any) in negotiating \nand  signing  contracts  to  have  part  of  the  road  network  under  its  jurisdiction \nmanaged under a concession agreement, e.g., build-operate-transfer projects.  \nThe  establishment  of  the  road  fund  and  its  basic  working  modalities.  The \npreference  is  for  short  enabling  legislation,  supported  by  regulations  to  be \npublished (and updated) by RCD and GOB. \n\n4. \n\nBusiness Procedures  \n\n \n\nAdherence  to  old  codes  and  procedures  sometimes  cause  delays  in  preparing  and \n8. \nimplementing projects. Decision making is not sufficiently decentralized and operating decisions \nare  delayed  due  to  too  many  layers  of  interventions.  RCD  is  aware  of  the  need  to  streamline \nbusiness  procedures  and  introduce  internationally  recognized  systems  and  practices  for \nprocurement,  quality  management,  planning,  contract  and  project  management,  and  financial \nmanagement. \n  \n9. \nThe  consultants  are  to  help  RCD  and  SHA/RIC  to  become  modern  road  management \nagencies.  This  requires  introducing  new  business  procedures  for  new  institutional  and \nmanagement  structures,  covering  (i)  procurement  and  contracting  processes,  (ii)  planning \nprocesses,  (iii)  quality  assurance  systems,  (iv)  engineering  (pavement  design,  maintenance \nmethods, and safety), and (v) human resource management. \n \n \n \n10. \n \n\nProject and Contract Management and Procurement Processes \n\nThe consultants will undertake the following: \n\na. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ntools, \n\nIntroduce  computerized  project  management \ntrain  engineers,  and \nimplement  standardized  district  reporting  systems  in  project  and  contract \nmanagement. \nRefine  RCD  standard  bid  documents  and  request \ninternational best practices. \nAssess  several  contracting  modalities  to  maintain  state  roads,  and  help  RCD \ndevelop and test several contracting modalities to maintain state roads, including \ncorridor  management,  performance-based  maintenance  contracts,  and \ncommunity-based maintenance contracts. \n\nfor  proposals  using \n\n \n\n \n \n11. \n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nPlanning Processes \n\nThe consultants will undertake the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDevelop  state-specific  norms  for  road  development  and  maintenance,  and \nimplement in planning and design. \nEstablish  planning  practices  and  train  engineers  at  the  district  level  based  on \ninternational best practices. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n47\n\n \n \n \n12. \n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nQuality Assurance \n\nThe consultants will undertake the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIdentify resource requirements for the unit. \nEstablish  a  quality  assurance  strategy  and  arrangement,  including  quality \nmanagement manual, procedures, and reporting system, taking into account the \nextensive state road network. \nPilot  test  the  manual  on  a  sample  of  different  types  of  works.  Train  the  staff  to \nuse  the  manual.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBetween 2002 and 2006, based on 1999 constant prices, India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 8.6%, \nlargely  pushed  by  transportation  and  communication  (including  trade),  agriculture,  and  manufacturing.  Of  all  the  industry \nsubsectors,  transportation,  communication,  and  trade  combined  for  the  highest  share,  at  25.6%  of  the  country\u2019s  GDP.  This \nperformance should be largely credited for the country\u2019s impressive  economic  growth  and for reducing poverty.  However in \nsome poor areas, gains from economic growth have yet to be distributed equitably, including in the state of Bihar. \n \nIn 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the 2008\u20132010 country operations business plana. This is part of the \nlarger  2008\u20132012  India  country  partnership  strategy.  Under  the  strategy,  support  for  infrastructure  development  will  remain \nthe core focus of ADB\u2019s India assistance strategy. For transport and communications, the Bihar State Highways Project will be \nADB\u2019s  first  support  for  Bihar\u2019s  roads;  it  aims  to  improve  transport  connectivity  within  the  state.  The  Project  will  augment \ntransport  capacity  in  a  financially  sustainable  manner.  As  Bihar  is  one  of  the  least-developed  states  in  India,  the  Project  is \nexpected  to  have  significant  development  impacts.  Its  short-term  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  include  employment  of  poor \npeople  in  road  construction,  tree  planting,  and  ensuing  maintenance  works.  These  opportunities  will  directly  increase  their \nearnings,  especially  for  those  who  are  largely  dependent  on  occasional  and  uncertain  employment.  Over  the  long-term, \nvillagers  are  expected  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented  agricultural  surplus  production.  The  Project  will \nhelp residents, particularly the youth, of rural areas to work for better-paying jobs in trading and other new employment areas. \nMoreover, it will directly contribute to peoples\u2019 access to social benefits such as health, education, and social services.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  rehabilitate  the  state  roads  in  Bihar  and  augment  connectivity  within  the  state.  The \nProject  will  cover  an  estimated  820  kilometers  of  state  roads  in  18  districts,  hence  creating  a  reliable  and  efficient  road \nnetwork  within  the  state.  Some  of  the  immediate  benefits  will  be  improved  access  to  socioeconomic  facilities,  safe  and \ncomfortable journeys with reduced fuel consumption and vehicle operating cost, and development of the rural economy. \n \nA  socioeconomic  baseline  survey,  community  consultations,  and  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  for  all  the \nsubprojects  during  August\u2013October  2007.  In  addition,  poverty  analysis  using  secondary  data,  and  a  review  of  government \nprograms and schemes were conducted. The data revealed that 42.6% of the total population in Bihar lives below the poverty \nline,  the  highest  in  the  country.  The  human  development  index  for  Bihar  was  0.267  in  2001  in  comparison  to  the  national \nvalue of 0.472. The people largely depend on agriculture, which has the lowest value-added among the country\u2019s industries. \nThe literacy rate at 47.53% is also an issue; 60.32% for males and 33.57% for females.  \n \n2.

Not applicable. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nBihar  has  a  large  population,  a  high  unemployment  rate,  and  increasing  social  tensions  arising  from  failure  to  meet \ndevelopment  aspirations.  The  main  sources  of  income  of  residents  in  the  project  locations  are  agriculture  wages  or  casual \nnonfarm  jobs.  Many  are  landless  or  near  landless.  All  economic  and  noneconomic  indicators  indicate  their  poor  status.  All \nbasic  services  and  infrastructure  are  poor.  The  communities  look  forward  to  having  upgraded  roads  as  improved  transport \nservices will provide them with better economic opportunities and quality of life.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \n \nA socioeconomic survey covering 908 households from 20 districts, and 73 focus group discussions were conducted during \nAugust\u2013October  2007  to  gather  feedback  from  local  communities  on  the  proposed  development  and  perceived \nsocioeconomic impacts. These discussions were held with men, women, farmers, indigenous people, high-income groups, the \npoor,  shopkeepers,  and  truckers  to  ensure  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  Project  and  its  impacts.  Other  key \nstakeholders such as government officials; including Bihar Sate AIDS Control Society, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, village \nhealth  workers,  and  block  development  officers  were  consulted  by  means  of  key  stakeholder  discussions.  Additionally, \nscreening and categorization checklists  were completed for each road to assess the likely impact of project development in \nterms of indigenous population and involuntary resettlement.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nC&P will be carried out during implementation of resettlement plans by local nongovernment organizations.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues.  Gender  participation  was  ensured  during  the  course  of  the  social  study  by  undertaking  a  process  of  gender \nanalysis  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project.  Focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women  belonging  to  different \nsocioeconomic  groups  such  as  high-income  group,  the  poor,  and  women  belonging  to  other  vulnerable  classes.  These \ndiscussions brought forth that the majority of the women felt the expansion of the road will benefit them as they will be able to \ntransport their products to markets and help increasing household income. They expected that some local residents will get \ninvolved in project activities.  They  wanted that the road should be constructed  without  any delay. During the  discussions, it \nwas observed that literacy among women is low, but education status has improved for the younger generation. Participation \nof women in political activities and employment opportunities is limited. However, the majority of women in the project areas \ntake  an  active  part  in  family  decision  making.  Some  noted  that  the  status  of  women  is  far  better  in  this  state  than  in  many \nstates in the country. The women work both in the house and outside; the majority reported that they are consulted by their \nspouse and other family members for taking any decision in the family. \n \n2. Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use \nof relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n  \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nThe Project will provide women with job opportunities and will not differentiate wages between men and women particularly \nfor work of equal value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix  12\n\n51\n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n \nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/\nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant \n \n \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nLimited \n\nNo Impact \n\nLimited \n\nLabor \n\n Employment \nopportunities \n Labor \nretrenchment \n Core labor \n\nstandards \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman \ntrafficking \n\nOthers(conflict, \npolitical \ninstability, etc), \nplease specify \n\nThe Project is designed to avoid land acquisition and minimize \nresettlement impacts by adopting the most feasible technical \ndesign. In addition, it entails rehabilitation of state roads, which \nwill occur within the available right-of-way and no private land \nacquisition will be required. The implications of these are being \nverified. Resettlement plans were prepared to guide \nimplementation of the nine subprojects. \n \nThe indigenous people population constitutes only 0.9% of the \ntotal state population. No indigenous people households will be \nadversely affected by the Project. The indigenous people \npopulation in Bihar and areas affected by the subprojects is \nintegrated with the modern and dominant population of the state. \nThey freely interact and share their sources of water, folklore, \nfood, infrastructure, and other belongings with the mainstream \npopulation and outside community. Moreover, these groups \nhave nuclear families, and are open to new ideas such as family \nplanning and formal education. Therefore, the socioeconomic \nimpacts of the subprojects will be the same for these people as \nthe mainstream population. In view of these facts, no separate \nindigenous people development plan was prepared. \n \nProject construction is expected to generate employment \nopportunities for local communities during the construction \nphase. Men and women will be paid equally for equal work. The \nRoad Construction Department (RCD) will ensure that all civil \nworks comply with all applicable labor laws, including equal pay \nfor equal work and non-employment of child labor. \n\nThe social assessments undertaken have not identified any \nsignificant risks on social aspects such as gender, HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking. However, RCD will ensure that all civil works \ncontractors disseminate information at worksites on the risks of \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed \nduring construction. Contracts for all subprojects will include \nspecific clauses on these undertakings, and the Government will \nstrictly monitor compliance during project implementation. In \naddition, RCD will conduct awareness programs for HIV/AIDS, \nhuman trafficking, and child labor for which \nagenies/nongovernment organizations may be engaged. \n \n\nIV.
