As  of \n12 November  2020,  the  country  had  only  one  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  contained  in \nquarantine after being identified from a repatriation flight. Vanuatu's efforts to prevent the spread \nof COVID-19 have come at significant economic and social costs. The program will help finance \nthe  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  response,  which  is  anchored  on  the \nHealth Preparedness and Response Plan (HPRP) and the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP), \nto mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. The proposed program is aligned with \nfour operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030\u2014(i) addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  addressing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, \n(iii) strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  (iv) promoting  rural  development \nand  food  security.2 It  is  also  aligned  with  the  Pacific  Approach  priority  of  managing  risks  and \nbuilding  resilience  by  strengthening  the  health  and  agriculture  sectors.3 Vanuatu  meets  all  the \nCPRO access criteria (Table 1).4  \n \n\n2. \nCountercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nAccess Criteria \n1. Adverse \nimpact of \nexogenous \nshocks \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nAfter growing by 2.8% annually during 2015\u20132019, Vanuatu\u2019s GDP is likely to contract by 9.8% \nin 2020 because of COVID-19-related declines in tourism, remittances, and exports, which are \nexacerbated by damages from Cyclone Harold. A fiscal deficit of 6.0% of GDP is expected in \n2020 driven by lower revenues and higher stimulus spending, after surpluses averaging 6.2% \nannually in 2018\u20132019. The expected current account deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2020 compares \nwith  an  average  annual  surplus  of  3.7%  in  2015\u20132019.  Up  to  70%  of  the  29,000  workers \nemployed in tourism in 2019 could lose their jobs by the end of 2020. It is estimated that the pre-\nCOVID-19 share of the population living below $1.90/day was 13.9% in 2020. This could rise to \n18.3%, with a 10% decline in consumption due to COVID-19.  \nThe  government  is  implementing  a  $44  million  countercyclical  response  focusing  on  public \nhealth  and  the  economy.  The  HPRP  aims  to  prevent  the  import  of  COVID-19  and  mitigate \ninfection risks while preparing to manage a potential outbreak through detection, isolation, and \nclinical management. The ESP seeks to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and \nbusinesses. It includes employment support, grants and fee relief for MSMEs, and support for \nagricultural production and education to assist poor and vulnerable groups, including women. \nThe  ESP  is  complemented  by  the  distribution  of  food  to  needy  households.  Assistance  to \nagriculture will be extended, and MSMEs will have access to credit of up to $90,000 at 1.0% \ninterest to support the economic recovery. \nThe  government's  pre-pandemic  macroeconomic  management  record  was  generally  sound. \nThe  IMF  confirms  that  the  economy  was  growing,  prices  were  stable,  fiscal  balances  were \naligned  with  the  economy's  cyclical  position,  and  foreign  exchange  reserves  were  strong. \nVanuatu's economy grew by 2.9% in 2019 and was forecast to grow at a similar rate in 2020. \nInflation was 2.8% in 2019 and was expected to remain within the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu's \ntarget of 0.0%\u20134.0% in 2020. The fiscal deficit fell from 7.3% of GDP in 2015 when Cyclone Pam \ndamages  required  reconstruction  expenditures.  The  government  reported  a  fiscal  surplus  of \n4.9% of GDP in 2019. A fiscal deficit of 1.0% of GDP was expected in 2020 because of lower \nrevenues from its citizenship program. Foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to about 12 \nmonths of imports at the end of 2019 and were expected to remain at similar levels in 2020.  \n\n3.

Coordination \nwith the IMF \n\n \n\nPublic health measures were implemented early to prevent COVID-19 from entering Vanuatu \nand to prepare the health system. Borders were closed on 23 March 2020, and a national state \nof  emergency  has  been  in  place  since  26  March  2020.  Repatriation  flights  commenced  after \nestablishing  limited  testing  capacity  on  25  May  2020,  and,  with  a  single  case  of  COVID-19 \nidentified  from  the  repatriation  flights,  the  system  has  proven  to  work  well.  Hospitals  were \nupgraded, medical personnel were trained on infection prevention control and contact tracing, \nand  personal  protective  equipment  was  distributed  to  Vila  Central  Hospital  and  Northern \nProvincial Hospital. The government intends to maintain and expand public health programs and \nrequested  ADB  support  to  prepare  for  introducing  a  COVID-19  vaccine  when  it  becomes \navailable.  Measures  to  mitigate  the  pandemic's  economic  impact  were  implemented  early  to \nsupport employment, including 4-month salary-equivalent payments to affected businesses, fee \nrelief for businesses, and grants for MSMEs, followed by education assistance. Support for food \nsecurity  is  ongoing.  Support  for  credits  to  MSMEs  through  a  government-owned  bank  and \nsupport for the agriculture sector will be extended beyond 2020. \nThe Joint World Bank\u2013IMF June 2019 DSA found that Vanuatu was at moderate risk of debt \ndistress. ADB's DSA, updated in October 2020, finds that Vanuatu's short-term growth prospects \ndeteriorated  with  COVID-19,  and  countercyclical  policy  will  sharply  worsen  fiscal  balances. \nWhile  fiscal  deficits  put  Vanuatu's  public  debt  on  a  rising  path,  they  will  be  offset  by  higher \neconomic  growth  in  the  longer  term.  The  government  intends  to  finance  fiscal  deficits  using \ndevelopment partner grants and domestic resources (including drawing down cash reserves). \nThe  ADB  grant  will  enable  it  to  prioritize  spending  on  countercyclical  measures.  The  DSA \nconcludes that with ADB grants, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio will remain lower than the threshold \nof 60%, as per Vanuatu's Debt Management Strategy (2019\u20132022) and will be sustainable.  \nThe IMF supports ADB's response and provided an assessment letter. The letter presents the \nIMF's  views  on  debt  sustainability,  is  consistent  with  ADB's  DSA  findings,  and  reports  that \nVanuatu's  risk  of  breaching  the  debt  threshold  will  be  elevated  if  another  disaster  occurs. \nADB coordinates macroeconomic monitoring with the IMF, and Vanuatu is on a standard 12-\nmonth  Article  IV  consultation  cycle.  The  country  continues  to  benefit  from  IMF  technical \nassistance  in  areas  including  foreign  exchange  reserve  management,  finance  sector \nsupervision, and national statistics. ADB and the IMF also participate in annual public financial \nmanagement partner meetings and share updates. \n\nADB = Asia Development Bank; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; DSA = debt sustainability analysis; ESP = Economic \nStimulus  Program;  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product;  HPRP  =  Health  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan;  IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund; MSMEs = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE  \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment context. Vanuatu is a small island developing state, vulnerable to natural \nhazards and global economic shocks. According to the World Risk Index Report, Vanuatu is the \nmost  at  risk  of  disasters  from  natural  hazards  among  180  economies  worldwide. 5  It  had  a \npopulation  of  about  305,000  in  2019  and  is  ranked  141st  of  189  economies  for  human \ndevelopment.6 About  75%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas.  The  main  contributors  to  the \neconomy are tourism and agriculture (crops and livestock). Major exports are beef, cocoa, copra, \nkava,  and  timber.  Vanuatu  depends  on  imported  food,  fuels,  and  machinery  and  equipment. \nThe  most  recent  national  data, from  2013,  shows  that  38.8%  of  people are multidimensionally \npoor (reflecting deprivations in health, education, and living standards), and another 32.3% are \nvulnerable  to  multidimensional  poverty. 7 Modeled  estimates  of  pre-COVID  poverty  levels  put \n13.9% of the population living below $1.90/day.8 \n\n \n\n5  Ruhr University. 2019.

Bulan et al. 2020. \"COVID-19 and Poverty: Some Scenarios.\" Unpublished note prepared for ADB\u2019s Economic \n\nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \nCyclone  damage.  Soon  after  the  global  outbreak  of  COVID-19,  Vanuatu  was  hit  by \n4. \nCyclone Harold on 6\u20137 April 2020.  Cyclone Harold was the most severe storm to strike Vanuatu \nsince Cyclone Pam in 2015. 9 It caused 3 deaths, affected 176,000 people, and damaged homes \nand  infrastructure.  Agricultural  produce  was  destroyed,  reducing  potential  exports  and \njeopardizing food security. Damage and loss from Cyclone Harold are estimated at 51% of GDP \nin  2020.  Cyclone  Harold  compounded  the  socioeconomic  stress  caused  by  COVID-19  as  the \ngovernment struggled to manage twin shocks. \n \nHealth system challenges. Vanuatu's health system faced significant challenges even \n5. \nbefore  COVID-19,  including  shortages  of  health care  workers to  deliver services.10 As  of  June \n2020, more than 50 of 402 health facilities had closed because of inadequate staffing or absence \nof  routine  maintenance.11 Despite  these  hurdles,  women's  health  in  Vanuatu  has  improved\u2014\nskilled birth attendance rates are high, at about 90%, and maternal mortality ratios are declining \n(down  from  225  deaths  per  100,000  live  births  in  1990  to  72  in  2017).  However,  this  remains \nhigher than the Sustainable Development Goal target of 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.12 The \nmajor causes of deaths in Vanuatu are cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and those affected \nby these diseases are susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms.13 Vanuatu has established a \n24-bed isolation capacity and five ventilators in its hospitals to prepare for COVID-19. The country \nhas a minimum 1-month supply of protective equipment, and more than 2,000 personnel were \ntrained in contact tracing and management of COVID-19. Vanuatu has established local testing \ncapacity but needs additional health sector support in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak.  \n \n6. \nPrevention  and  containment  measures.  The  government  took  proactive  actions  to \nprevent cases, starting from January 2020. It announced the $6 million HPRP on 24 January 2020 \nto  strengthen  prevention  and  containment  (para.  17)  and  protect  public  health.  This  included \nissuance  of  health  advisories,  health  screenings  at  airports  and  seaports,  and  progressive \nrestrictions on international travel as the pandemic evolved\u2014culminating in the closure of borders \non 23 March 2020. A state of emergency was declared on 26 March 2020 and remains in effect \nuntil  31 December  2020.  Other  measures  implemented  include  social  distancing,  temporary \nclosure  of  schools,  restrictions  on  interisland  travel,  limited  passengers  on  public  transport, \ncancellation  of  mass  gatherings  and  sporting  events,  early  closure  of  businesses,  and  an \novernight  curfew.  Limited  testing  capacity  was  established  with  support  from  the  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO)  and  the  Pacific  Community. 14  The  government  allowed  the  phased \nrepatriation  of  residents  stranded  abroad.15 Quarantine  processes  are  in  effect  for  all  inbound \ntravelers to limit potential contact with the public. As of 12 November 2020, Vanuatu has only one \nconfirmed case of COVID-19 in border quarantine. The government has since ceased repatriation \nflights and imposed domestic travel restrictions to minimize the risk of community transmission. \n\n \n\n9  Government of  Vanuatu,  National  Disaster Management  Office. 2020.

The quarantine period is also increased from 14 to 28 days.   \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \nCoordination of responses. The National COVID-19 Taskforce was formed in January \n7. \n2020 and merged into the National Disaster Management Office on 26 March 2020. The National \nHealth Emergency Operations Centre under the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been coordinating \nCOVID-19 preparedness activities. The capacity of the operations center was supplemented with \nsupport from development partners such as Australia, France, Israel, the Pacific Community, Red \nCross, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund, and WHO. \nProvincial health emergency operations centers were also set up.  \n \nPre\u2013COVID-19 record of generally sound macroeconomic management. Vanuatu's \n8. \neconomy  experienced  growth  from  2004  to  2019,  driven  by  expanding  tourism,  public \ninvestments, economic reforms, and a stable macroeconomy. Following Cyclone Pam in 2015, \neconomic growth averaged 2.8% during 2015\u20132019, driven by construction and tourism. Inflation \naveraged  2.3%  over  the  same  period.  While  relief  and  rehabilitation  expenditure  resulted  in  a \nfiscal deficit of 7.3% in 2015, this was reduced subsequently, and fiscal surpluses averaging 6.2% \nof GDP were recorded in 2018 and 2019 (Table 2). Fiscal deficits largely related to Cyclone Pam \nreconstruction have led to a rise in public debt from 34.4% of GDP in 2015 to 44.4% of GDP in \n2019. Vanuatu's Debt Management Strategy (2019\u20132022) targets nominal public debt below 60% \nand external debt below 40% of GDP. The strategy targets concessional debt for investment only. \nCurrent  account  surpluses  were  recorded  in  2018  and  2019,  averaging  11.3%  of  GDP,  and \nforeign exchange reserves equaled about 12 months of imports at the end of 2019. The IMF also \nfinds that the economy was growing, prices were stable, the external position was stronger than \nexpected, and public finances were sound.16 Vanuatu was expecting a fiscal deficit in 2020, on \nthe  back  of  declining  revenues  from  the  citizenship  by  investment  program,  and  this  had  also \nnegatively impacted the expected current account deficit. Nonetheless, the performance was in \nline with the economy's cyclical position.  \n \n\nTable 2: Selected Macroeconomic Indicators, 2017\u20132021 \n(% of gross domestic product, unless otherwise specified) \n2018 \n\n2019e \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n2020p \nPre\u2013 \nCOVID-19 a \n 2.8 \n 2.2 \n  (5.0) \n29.2 \n18.1 \n  7.5 \n  3.5 \n30.2 \n  (1.0) \n43.2 \n38.5  \n562 \n975 \n\n2020p \nWith \nCOVID-19 \n(9.8) \n  3.0 \n  (5.8) \n44.3 \n15.4 \n 16.8b \n12.1 \n50.3 \n  (6.0) \n55.2 \n39.9 \n583 \n852 \n\n  2.9 \n  2.8 \n12.4 \n42.0 \n17.6 \n14.0 \n10.4 \n37.1 \n  4.9 \n44.4 \n39.1 \n512 \n934 \n\n  4.4 \n  3.1 \n  (6.1) \n 35.6 \n 17.1 \n   7.0 \n 11.4 \n 36.8 \n  (1.2) \n 45.0 \n 35.6 \n 394 \n 880 \n\nReal GDP growth (%) \nInflation (CPI % change) \nCurrent account balance  \nTotal revenues and grants  \n  Taxes  \n  Nontax revenues  \n  Grants  \nTotal expenditures  \nOverall fiscal balance  \nGross public debt  \n  External debt \nGross international reserves ($ million) \nNominal GDP ($ million) \n\n  2.9 \n  2.3 \n10.2 \n38.8 \n17.8 \n12.4 \n  8.5 \n31.3 \n  7.5 \n45.5 \n38.2 \n434 \n915 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, e = estimates, GDP = gross domestic production, p = \nprojections. \na Based on Asian Development Outlook Update, September 2019. \nb Revenues from citizenship by investment program increased significantly during first half of 2020. \nSources:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates  and  projections,  Reserve  Bank  of  Vanuatu,  Vanuatu  Department  of \nFinance and Treasury, and International Monetary Fund. \n \nTransmission  mechanisms.  COVID-19  had  its  most  substantial  impact  on  Vanuatu's \n9. \ntourism industry, which in 2019 contributed almost 35% of GDP, 67.3% of exports, and 29,000 \n\n2021p \nWith \nCOVID-19 \n  1.0 \n  2.2 \n  (9.6) \n37.4 \n16.1 \n12.4 \n  8.9 \n40.4 \n  (3.0) \n56.4 \n39.5 \n681 \n886 \n\n16 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n \njobs.17 Border closures have halted tourism, a source of income in urban and rural areas, and a \nkey generator of foreign exchange and government revenue. Service exports are expected to fall \nby  68%  compared  with  2019.  Tourism  is  expected  to  recover  gradually,  given  the  economic \nslowdown in the two largest visitor source markets: Australia (52% of visitors) and New Zealand \n(13%). Remittances, estimated by the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) at 13% of GDP in 2019, \nare expected to fall since workers cannot freely travel to Australia and New Zealand, which have \ndedicated  labor  mobility  schemes  for  the  Pacific.  More  than  10,000  workers  from  Vanuatu \nparticipate in seasonal work in Australia and New Zealand annually.18 \n \nEconomic  impacts.  Vanuatu's  economy  is  expected  to  contract  by  9.8%  in  2020 \n10. \n(compared with 2.9% growth in 2019) because of COVID-19 and the impacts of Cyclone Harold. \nOther  key  macroeconomic  variables  are  expected  to  worsen  in  2020  (Table  2).  Vanuatu's \nmerchandise  exports  are  expected  to  fall  by  43%  from  2019  because  of  lower  demand. \nThe current account deficit is forecast at 5.8% of GDP in 2020 (compared with a surplus of 12.4% \nof GDP in 2019) because tourism stopped. Economic growth of 1.0% is expected in 2021, driven \nlargely by a recovery in tourism, agriculture, and post-cyclone construction activities. The duration \nof the COVID-19 crisis poses significant risks to the outlook.  \n \n11. \nFiscal pressures. Declining tourism, combined with lower demand under the COVID-19 \ncontainment  measures,  will  result  in  lower  domestic  revenue  in  2020. 19  The  government's \ncountercyclical  response  will  further  strain  the  deteriorating  fiscal  position.  The  fiscal  deficit, \nprojected to reach 6.0% of GDP in 2020 (footnote 19), will be financed by domestic loans and \ndrawdown  of  cash  reserves  accumulated  from  fiscal  surpluses  in  2018  and  2019.  Economic \nrecovery will require substantial resources beyond 2020. A fiscal deficit of 3.0% is projected in \n2021. The government intends to adhere to its debt strategies and maintain public debt below \n60% of GDP (and external debt below 40% of GDP), while the Debt Management Strategy (2019\u2013\n2022)  prevents  the  government  from  borrowing  for  operating  payments  (para.  8).  Financing \noptions are, therefore limited. \n \n12. \nIncreased risks in the finance sector. An extended period of tourism shutdown is likely \nto  cause  financial  difficulties  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  that \noperate  in  tourism  and  related  industries.  About  20%  of  MSMEs  are  owned  and/or  led  by \nwomen. 20  Failing  MSMEs  and  employment  losses  will  impact  the  commercial  banks'  loan \nperformance and dampen prospects for Vanuatu's economic recovery.21 About 10% of bank loans \nare to the tourism sector, and 55% are for personal loans such as housing mortgages and car \nleases, whose servicing may become challenging. The nonperforming loan ratio was 15.5% in \nMarch 2020, increasing by 1.1 percentage points from September 2019.22 \n \n13. \nSignificant  poverty  and  social  impact.  It  is  estimated  that  Vanuatu's  share  of  the \npopulation living below $1.90/day could rise from 13.9% (para. 3) to 18.3%, with a 10% decline \nin  consumption  because  of  COVID-19  (footnote  6).  Poverty  is  higher  in  the  two  major  urban \ncenters  of  Port  Vila  and  Luganville  than  in  rural  areas.  While  those  living  in  rural  areas  are \nvulnerable  to  multidimensional  poverty,  those  living  in  urban  areas  have  had  their  livelihoods \nimpacted by the collapse in tourism.

While most tourism activities are in urban areas, the lack of demand \nfor agricultural produce from hotels and restaurants affects rural incomes as well. Even before \nCOVID-19, market vendors (of whom about 91% are women) were more vulnerable to poverty \nthan  other  groups.  24 Interventions  to  prevent  the  entry  and  spread  of  COVID-19  have  already \nresulted  in  many  women  losing  their  livelihoods  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors  (including \nmarket  vendors  and  lower-skilled  employees  in  hotels  and  restaurants).  Strict  measures  also \nresulted  in  declining  air  and  sea  freight  volumes,  which  restricts  the  availability  of  food. \nThese impacts could reduce assets, increase personal debt burdens, and lower food intake or \nthe quality of intake\u2014with long-term detrimental effects on social welfare.  \n \nImpact  of  both  disasters  on  health.  The  co-occurrence  of  Cyclone  Harold  and  the \n14. \nCOVID-19  pandemic made  it  even  more  difficult for  Vanuatu's  health  system to  overcome  the \nimpacts on health and well-being. These include interrupted access to health services, damaged \nmedical equipment such as the immunization cold chain, limited availability of essential medicines \nand equipment because of disrupted supply chains, damaged crops undermining food supply and \nnutrition,  and  contaminated  water  sources  catalyzing  the  spread  of  diseases.  Preliminary  data \nshow  an  increase  in  diarrheal  diseases,  respiratory  infections,  leptospirosis,  typhoid,  dengue, \nmalnourishment,  skin  infections,  and  an  elevated  risk  of  mental  illness  from  evacuation  and \nunemployment.25 The gains made in improving women's health are likely to be compromised by \nan outbreak of COVID-19, particularly if funding for essential services is not maintained. The WHO \nCountry Preparedness and Response Status for Vanuatu remains at Level 2 as of June 2020 in \nthe response category \"high risk of imported cases,\" indicating the need for significant support.26 \n \n15. \nGender impacts. In addition to job losses by women (para. 13), COVID-19 will exacerbate \ngender  inequalities.  The  prioritization  of  COVID-19  responses  threatens  women's  continued \naccess to maternal and reproductive health services, a particular issue in Vanuatu where maternal \nmortality  ratios  are  still relatively  high (para.  5).27 Poor  access  to  basic  health  services,  limited \navailability  of \ninfrastructure,  difficult \ntransportation, and delayed referrals of life-threatening conditions are major contributing factors. \nThe  lifetime  prevalence  of  intimate  partner  violence  is  high  in  Vanuatu,  with  60%  of  women \nreporting  some  form  of  this.  The  COVID-19 threat  and  associated  movement restrictions  have \nincreased gender-based violence (GBV) while simultaneously making it more difficult for women \nand girls to access services. Data from GBV service providers suggest that already high levels of \nGBV are rising further, and reports of sexual exploitation as a result of economic hardship and \neconomic abuse by partners are increasing.  \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe  government's  countercyclical  response  to  COVID-19  amounts  to  5.2%  of  GDP, \nfocusing  on  health  since  January  2020  and  providing  economic  stimulus  since  April  2020. \nThe HPRP aims to keep COVID-19 out of Vanuatu and contain it if it does enter.

The initial \nresponse to COVID-19 (paras. 6\u20137) was put in place before a new coalition government assumed \noffice on 20 April 2020. The new administration focused on immediate cyclone relief as well as \nmitigation  of  COVID-19  impacts.  It  announced  additional  components  of  the  countercyclical \nresponse  to support  economic recovery\u2014$26.7 million  support to MSMEs  with  credit  provided \nthrough  a  government-owned  bank  beyond  2020  and  expanded  support  to  agriculture  with  a \n$10.6 million program in 2021 targeting agricultural production and employment while ensuring \nthe availability of fresh and nutritious food. The government's countercyclical response to COVID-\n19 will continue until December 2021, and several key measures are already being implemented \n(paras. 17\u201321).  \n \n\n1. \n\nHealth Protection  \n\n \nThe HPRP, implemented by MOH, outlines (i) containment measures to prevent the import \n17. \nof cases and interrupt local transmission through quarantine of clusters of sporadic cases; and \n(ii) mitigation measures to  prevent  community  outbreaks through  isolation,  infection  prevention \ncontrol,  enhanced  contact  tracing  and  surveillance,  and  risk  communication  in  communities. \nThe  HPRP  adheres  to  the  WHO's  recommended  operational  guidelines  for  COVID-19 \nresponses.28 Of the $6 million health budget, 20% is allocated for infrastructure; 40% for clinical \nmanagement  of  suspected  cases;  23%  for coordination,  communications,  and  prevention;  and \n17% for early detection and isolation. Personal protective equipment was provided to all health \ncare  workers  who  would  tend  to  COVID-19  patients  in  Vila  Central  Hospital  and  Northern \nProvincial  Hospital.  More  than  2,000  public  and  health  care  workers  were  trained  in  contact \ntracing  to  improve  surveillance  and  clinical  management  of  COVID-19.  MOH  is  also  intent  on \nimproving  community  awareness  through  ongoing  public  information  campaigns,  including  a \ndedicated online information page on key measures to prevent and contain the virus's spread.29 \nHospitals  were  refurbished,  24  isolation  beds  were  prepared,  and  local  testing  capacity  was \nestablished.  MOH  plans  to  keep  expanding  laboratory  facilities,  isolation  wards,  and  refresher \ntraining  in  the  medium-  and  long-term.  Measures  to  prevent  and  respond  to  GBV  were  also \nintroduced (para. 34). The government intends to maintain and expand public health programs \nand requested ADB support to prepare for the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, once available. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Support \n\n \n18. \nThe  government's  $38 million  initial  economic  support  will  alleviate  the  impact  of fewer \nemployment  opportunities  and  business  activities  and  provide  social  protection. 30  The  ESP \ncomprises the following measures.  \n\n(i)  Employment stabilization payment\u2014$22.2 million. The government prioritized job \nprotection in recognition of the important role of informal social protection networks, \nwhereby  those  with  paid  employment  support  extended  families  and  communities. \nThe traditional social protection system has been an integral part of Vanuatu's post-\ndisaster relief and recovery efforts. The employment stabilization payment supports \nin  businesses  affected  by  COVID-19.  The  government  reimburses  affected \nbusinesses  with  up to  $260  per  employee  on their  payroll  per month  for  4 months \n(April\u2013August). As a further incentive to retain employees, employers receive a further \n12% of the amount they are reimbursed for employee wages for contributions to the \nVanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) and administrative costs. The support was \navailable to all industries affected by COVID-19. The scheme is available to all 7,391 \n\n28 WHO. 2020.

With  an \nannual turnover of less than $1.7 million, MSMEs can access a maximum grant of \n$520 to support their operating cash flow requirements. About 450 of 1,500 potential \nrecipients  are  MSMEs  owned  or  co-owned  by  women.  Recipients  also  include \nlicensed holders of small market stalls. The government waived business license fees \nfor 2020 or, if these were paid before 31 March 2020, will waive the fees for 2021. \n(iii)  Agriculture  support\u2014$3.5  million.  The  government  will  also  support  increased \nproduction and marketing of copra, kava, cocoa, and other commodities through price \nsubsidies and transportation assistance from farms to urban centers. Price subsidies \nwill  supplement  the  incomes  of  smallholder  farmers  and  allow  larger  farmers  to \nemploy more  workers.  About  31,650  households  engaged  in  cash  crop production \ncould benefit from this support.33  \n\n(iv)  Tuition fee grant\u2014$4.5 million.

Additional  measures  include  (a) rent  tax \nexemptions for property owners, (b) road tax exemptions for MSMEs and individuals, \n(c)  residence  and  work permit  exemptions to  encourage  nonresidents to  remain  in \nVanuatu, and (d) exemptions from other fees and charges applying to MSMEs and \nindividuals. \n\n \n19. \nSupport from the finance sector. In addition to the HPRP and ESP support, the RBV \nset up a disaster recovery and import-export facility of up to $10 million to assist exporters and \nimporters.  The  RBV  also  reduced  official  interest  rates  from  2.90%  to  2.25%  and  the  capital \nadequacy  ratio  from  12%  to  10%  to  align  with  expansionary  fiscal  policies.  It  requires  foreign \ncommercial  banks  to  seek  prior  approval  for  repatriation  of  capital  as  an  exchange  control \nmeasure. Formal social protection is available to 53% of Vanuatu's workforce through the VNPF, \nincluding those who are informally employed but have registered with the VNPF through voluntary \ncontributions (footnote 34). VNPF members who lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 crisis \ncan  access  interest-free  hardship  relief  loans  up  to  $850.

The initial $3.5 million support for agriculture under the ESP will be \n21. \nsupplemented by $10.6 million financing in 2021 for ongoing agricultural assistance programs. \nThis  includes  targeting  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  to  deliver  extension  services,  food \ncrop  planting  materials,  and  additional  markets;  and  will  also  assist  mechanization.  To  further \nboost economic recovery, the government will provide $26.7 million in financing to support lending \nto MSMEs beyond 2020. MSMEs will be able to borrow up to $90,000 at an interest rate of 1.0%.   \n \nC. \n \n22. \nProposed program. ADB's fiscal response program will help the government implement \nits  countercyclical  measures  to  mitigate  the  adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  of  COVID-19. \nThe program will provide the government with the fiscal space to meet critical public health needs \nwhile managing the effects of the economic downturn on vulnerable groups and businesses. It is \naligned with the following overarching development objective: adverse impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic on the economy, health systems, and social services minimized. The program outcome \nwill be: adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and businesses mitigated. The \nthree program outputs are: (i) health sector responses to COVID-19 implemented; (ii) measures \nfor  supporting  employment  and  businesses  implemented;  and  (iii) food  security  and  education \nsupport programs implemented. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n23. \nADB's value addition. The program builds on a strong base of country knowledge and \nrelationships that supported investments in infrastructure, public sector management, and private \nsector  development. 35  To  enhance  COVID-19  preparedness,  ADB  provided  test  cartridges, \nswabs,  and  other  medical  supplies  totaling  $0.9  million. 36  ADB  also  provided  support  for \nquarantine facilities, human resources, and the expansion of isolation facilities.37 A regional health \nproject is strengthening immunization programs and access to quality-assured safe vaccines at \naffordable  prices. 38 Additional  financing  of  $3.8  million  is  proposed  under  the  regional  health \nproject  to  upgrade  cold  chains,  strengthen  surveillance,  and  procurement  of  the  COVID-19 \nvaccine,  once  available.  ADB  will  also  support  one  long-term  economic  advisor  in  the  Prime \nMinister's  office  to  provide  policy  advice  on  economic  recovery,  and  another  in  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Economic Management (MFEM) to strengthen the oversight and monitoring of state-\nowned  enterprises.39 Technical  assistance  is  available  to  support  the  government  in  collecting \ngender-based data and monitoring social implications, including the impact on women.40 \n \n\n \n\n35 ADB.

ADB will provide grants and concessional loans for energy access, \nurban infrastructure, and maritime transport during 2020\u20132023.45 \n \n25. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Effective  development  partner  coordination  has \nenabled  sequenced  financing  and  supplementation  of  government  capacity  in  preparing  the \nhealth  sector  (para.  7). ADB  consulted  with the World  Bank, the  IMF,  Australia,  New  Zealand, \nthe  European  Union,  and  other  development  partners  on  Vanuatu's  financing  needs  and  the \ntiming of support. The World Bank, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand provided \nbudget  support.  Australia  and  the  People's  Republic  of  China  contributed  essential  medical \nequipment and supplies. For the public health response, ADB worked closely with United Nations \nagencies in Vanuatu, including UNICEF and WHO, on technical support for health preparedness \nand  response. 46  The  IMF  provides  advisory  and  technical  support  with  macroeconomic \nassessments and monetary and financial policy advice, which is in addition to staff consultations \nand  Article  IV  requirements.  The  IMF  shares  its  assessment  reports  with  the  ADB.  IMF  was \nconsulted  as  the  COVID-19  crisis  evolved  and  prepared  an  assessment  letter  to  confirm  that \nVanuatu's  macroeconomic  policy  before  COVID-19  had  generally  been  sound  and  that  the \npandemic significantly impacted Vanuatu's economy (footnotes 16 and 22). \n \n26. \nLessons.  The  proposed  program  applies  lessons  from  ADB's  experience  in  providing \neconomic  recovery  support  in  the  Pacific  during  the  2008\u20132009  global  financial  crisis. 47 \nEarlier programs demonstrated the need to support aggregate demand while safeguarding the \nfiscal  position  and  the  role  of  development  partner  coordination  in  a  comprehensive  crisis \nresponse.  ADB's  past  engagement  with  Vanuatu  highlighted \nto  overcome \nimplementation capacity constraints. Accordingly, the new program will use existing government \nmechanisms for program monitoring and implementation. The ESP implementation will rely on \nthe existing database and records of the VNPF and key government agencies to verify potential \nbeneficiaries'  eligibility.  Tuition  fee  assistance  will  use  the  existing  school  grant  procedures. \nTo supplement the implementation capacity, ADB is mobilizing extensive TA support (para. 23).  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nReduced government revenues and higher countercyclical development expenditures will \nlead  to  a  larger  financing  need  in  2020  than  initially  expected  (Table  3).  A  fiscal  deficit  of \n$51.1 million (6.0% of GDP) is estimated in 2020, and $26.5 million in 2021 (para. 11). The CPRO \nbudget  support  is  financing  17.4%  of  the  total  financing  needs  for  2020.  Other  development \npartners  have  disbursed  budget  support  grants  equivalent  to  $29.0  million  in  2020.  Domestic \nresources include $12.7 million in domestic debt and use of $38.4 million in cash reserves.

The grant proceeds will \nsupport development financing needs, excluding ineligible items.48  \n \nVanuatu's  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  debt  was  44.4%  of  GDP  in  2019,  of  which \n29. \ndomestic debt was 5.2% of GDP.49 Vanuatu is considered to be at moderate risk of debt distress \nbased on the IMF's 2019 debt sustainability analysis. A substantial component of the public debt \nwas  to  finance  the  post-Cyclone  Pam  reconstruction  activities  and  infrastructure  investments. \nADB's  October  2020  debt  sustainability  analysis  suggests  that  without  grants  from  its \ndevelopment  partners,  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  will  breach  the  threshold  of  60%  by  2024. \nHowever,  with  grants,  the  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  will  reach  48.7%  by  2024  and  remain \nsustainable. 50  The  government  intends  to  use  development  partner  grants  and  domestic \nresources  (including  the  drawdown  of  cash  reserves)  to  meet  its  financing  needs  in  2020. 51 \nThe IMF's September 2020 assessment finds that even though the risk of debt distress remains \nmoderate, risks will be elevated with another disaster (footnotes 16 and 22). \n  \nE. \n \n30. \nThe  program  will  be  implemented  from  1  February  2020  to  31  December  2021,  using \nprimarily existing mechanisms and platforms (para. 26). The MFEM will be the executing agency. \nThe government formed an implementation team to execute, supervise, and monitor compliance \nwith  set  guidelines,  and  ensure  communication  and  information  dissemination  to  potential \nbeneficiaries.  The  implementing  agencies  are  MOH  for  health  measures,  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Livestock,  Forestry,  Fisheries  and  Biosecurity  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and \nTraining. Through the MFEM, the government will monitor budget execution under the ESP and \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n48 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n49 ADB  estimates  based  on:  Reserve  Bank  of  Vanuatu.  2020.  Central  Government  Gross  Debt. \nhttps://www.rbv.gov.vu/index.php/en/e-gdds-statistics. The IMF estimates public debt at 46.1% of GDP in its 2020 \nassessment letter to ADB (footnotes 16 and 22).   \n\n50 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n51 Cash reserves held by government as at end of 2019 was $73.2 million. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \nproduce quarterly and midyear reports. The government also separated bank accounts and cost \ncenters to facilitate reporting and monitoring. While general capacity constraints exist, risks are \nmitigated  because  the  government  has  successfully  implemented  countercyclical  measures \nthrough its regular systems. ADB technical assistance will support the government in collecting \nsex-disaggregated data and monitoring social implications, including the impact on women (para. \n23). Grant proceeds will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n31. \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards. 52  The  actions  were  assessed  and  are  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse \nenvironmental or social safeguard impacts within the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n32. \nPoverty  and  social.  Despite  Vanuatu's  lack  of  formal  social  protection  programs,  the \nemployment  stabilization  payments  will  prevent  affected  workers  from  falling  into  poverty. \nThey  will  also  generate  traditional  support  for  those  outside  the  formal  support  schemes. \nAssistance  to  MSMEs  will  help  them  stay  in  business,  including  self-employed  workers  who \ndepend on a single income source, such as market stall owners. Households have been relieved \nof  paying  school  fees,  estimated  at  $290,  equivalent  to  3  months  of  household  income.  Most \nproducers in Vanuatu are smallholder farmers. Support for agriculture will address food security \nand provide income to help meet nonfood essentials such as access to basic services, transport, \nand communication, especially during the pandemic. Support to agriculture will be expanded in \n2021. Transport and logistics are significant constraints and a critical cost component of supply \nchains  for  cocoa,  copra,  and  other  crops.  Assistance  from  the  stimulus  package  will  support \nsmallholder farmers to maximize income opportunities from cash crops. Distribution of food and \nhealth supplies to an estimated 55,000 households complements the ESP (para. 20).  \n \nGender.  The  program  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.53 The  health \n33. \nresponse to COVID-19 ensures that (i) health workers in hospitals and subnational laboratories, \nincluding 40% women, receive personal protective equipment; (ii) proactive health messages on \nCOVID-19  and  pregnancy,  childbirth,  and  breastfeeding  are  disseminated  widely;  (iii)  nutrition \nsupplies are provided to 3,000 pregnant and lactating women, and children; and (iv) funding for \nmaternal  and  reproductive  health  services  will  be  continued.  Also,  socioeconomic  impacts  on \nwomen  will  be  mitigated  through  support  for  employment  and  MSMEs.  The  ESP  also  assists \nbusinesses owned by women in retaining employees and supports female employees in \"at risk\" \nindustries. The one-off grant provided to MSMEs will benefit women-owned businesses (about \n18% of all MSMEs), including licensed microentrepreneurs such as market vendors. Public sector \nemployment, where women make up 40% of the workforce, will be maintained. Free tuition was \nintroduced for early childhood education and public schools to reduce hardships and safeguard \nprevious gender gap reductions in education enrollment.  \n \n34. \nFinally, measures taken to prevent and respond to GBV include (i) activation of the gender \nand protection subcommittee; (ii) provision of remote GBV services (through a telephone hotline); \n(iii)  continued  employment  of  all  GBV  staff  (45  staff  in  five  centers);  (iv) upgrade  of  centers  to \ninclude additional handwashing facilities; (v) public campaigns in national newspapers to provide \ninformation on GBV and COVID-19; (vi) activation of \"authorized persons\" to help women access \nservices  in  rural  areas;  (vii)  police  training  on  GBV  and  the  provision  of  police  rotations  to \n\n52 ADB.

A  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  self-assessment  was \ncompleted in 2015. Subsequently, the MFEM prepared a Public Financial Management Reform \nRoadmap 2017\u20132021.  54 The road map focuses on (i) enhancing controls to ensure compliance \nin procurement, debt management, and payroll management; (ii) adopting medium-term planning \nand budgeting; (iii) strengthening budget accountability; (iv) improving domestic revenue; and (v) \nimproving public investment and asset management. Vanuatu has recently improved its rank from \n71st  in  2017  to  64th  of  180  economies  in  2018  and  2019  in  Transparency  International's \nCorruption Perception Index.55 Development partners such as Australia and the European Union \nhave  supported  public  financial  management  improvements  in  Vanuatu.  ADB's  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.56 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks  \nProlonged COVID-19 pandemic and border \nclosures  render  the  ESP  less  effective, \nleading to a continued economic slowdown, \ndisruption of business activities, and further \nloss of income and employment. \nAnother external shock, such as a disaster, \nplunges the country into a deeper recession \nand debt distress. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nADB  engages  continuously  with \nthe  government  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  provide  an  effective  and  appropriate \nresponse, including additional support if required. Other initiatives in \nthe  pipeline  will  continue  to  support  private  sector  investment, \nalternative employment and generate additional economic activities. \nADB  will  coordinate  with  other  development  partners  to  provide \nemergency support guided by follow-on International Monetary Fund \nassessments.

Adverse  \n  Impact of \n  Exogenous \n  Shocks \n\n2. Counter-      \ncyclical  \n  Development \n  Expenditures \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nVanuatu's  economy  is  forecasted  to  decline  significantly  in  2020  as  a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its economic growth averaged 2.8% \nfrom  2015 to  2019.  As  of  12  November  2020,  the  country  reported  its \nfirst  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  from  a  repatriation  flight,  in  border \nquarantine.  Although  Vanuatu  did  not  have  any  confirmed  cases  of \nCOVID-19  until  11  November  2020,  border  closures  have  stopped  all \nvisitor arrivals since April 2020.  \n \nWith tourism declining significantly and agricultural crops damaged due \nto Cyclone Harold, the economy is forecast to decline by 9.8% in 2020.  \n \nWithout tourism, the government's tax revenues are expected to decline \nsignificantly, and combined with higher expenditures related to COVID-\n19, lead to reduced fiscal buffers. A fiscal deficit equivalent to 6.0% of \nGDP  is  projected  in  2020,  and  a  further  deficit  of  3.0%  is  projected  in \n2021.  \n \nWith higher levels of expenditure and reduced revenue, the government \nrelies on development partner grants and domestic resources (including \ncash reserves to meet financing shortfalls. At the end of 2019, Vanuatu \nhad foreign exchange reserves equivalent to about 12 months of imports. \nGiven  their  high  pre-pandemic  levels,  foreign  exchange  reserves  are \nexpected  to  remain  adequate  despite  a  decline  in  tourism  and  export \nearnings. The final magnitude of the economic losses will depend on how \nthe outbreak evolves and the tourism industry's recovery.  \n\nThe  government's  measures  for  addressing  COVID-19  impact  are \nincluded in a HPRP and an ESP.  \n \nThe  HPRP  has  been  iterated  with  the  evolution  of  the  pandemic  with \nassistance  from  the  World  Health  Organization.  This  plan  focuses  on \npreventing  the  virus  from  entering  the  country  and  getting  the  country \nready  if  it  enters,  particularly  the  health  sector.  Increasing  preventive \nmeasures have been introduced since late January 2020 through travel \nadvisories, border closures, and quarantine measures. The government \nis  conducting  community  awareness,  strengthening  public  health \nsystems, and enhancing preparedness for effective case management \nwhile maintaining essential health services. \n \nincludes  revenue  measures  and  several \nThe  $38  million  ESP \nexpenditure  measures.  Approximately  60%  of  this  stimulus  package \nconsists  of  a  pro-employment  countercyclical  expenditure  program  to \nsupport those likely to lose jobs because of the pandemic. Another 9% \nis  allocated  to  help  MSMEs  to  retain  workers.  The  MSMEs  are  also \nsupported by revenue exemptions to reduce businesses' operating costs \nto mitigate insolvency.  \n\n\uf0fc \n\n\uf0fc \n\n\fCPRO Criteria \nand indicators \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n23 \n\n \nThe  revenue  measures  include  exemptions  for  business  license  fees, \nturnover taxes, rent tax, work permit fees, and several other smaller fees. \nThe  central  bank  has  also \nreduced  banks'  capital  adequacy \nrequirements and policy interest rates to facilitate lower interest costs. \nThe government commenced the implementation of its stimulus program \napproved on 30 March 2020.  \n \nOn 10 April 2020, the government mandated the implementation of the \nFamily  Protection  Act  and  prioritized  preventing  and  responding  to \ndomestic violence.  \n \nFollowing  initial  short-term  measures,  the  government  has  planned \nsignificant  support  to  the  agricultural  sector  to  facilitate  economic \nrecovery and ensure food security. The government has also provided \nadditional  liquidity  to  government-owned  commercial  banks  to  support \nMSMEs through the provision of credit. \n\nrecord  of  generally  sound \nThe  government  has  a  pre-shock \nmacroeconomic  management.  The  economy  grew  by  an  average  of \n2.8% between 2015 and 2019. Economic growth was driven by tourism \ngrowth  and  post-Cyclone-Pam  reconstruction  activities.  Prices  were \nrelatively  stable,  with  inflation  averaging  2.2%  over  the  same  period, \nwithin the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu's target range of 0%\u20134. The fiscal \ndeficit was high in 2015 due to relief and reconstruction needs following \nCyclone Pam but was reduced in the following years.  \n \nAs a result of significant reconstruction requirements following Cyclone \nPam in 2015 and a large existing infrastructure pipeline, external debt \nrose from 25.6% of GDP in 2015 to 39.1% of GDP in 2019. The current \naccount surpluses averaged 3.7% from 2015 to 2019. Foreign exchange \nreserves  were  equivalent  to  about  12 months  of imports  at  the  end  of \n2019. \n\nAs  of  12  November  2020,  Vanuatu  had  only  one  confirmed  case  of \nCOVID-19  contained  in  quarantine  after  being  identified  from  a \nrepatriation flight.  \n \nWith  a  fragile  health  system,  further  compromised  by  damages \nsustained  as  a  result  of  Cyclone  Harold,  which  would  quickly  be \noverwhelmed  if  the  virus  arrived  and  spread  rapidly,  the  government \nimplemented  strong  measures  to  prevent  the  entry  of  the  virus  and \nprepare the country, particularly the health system, for an outbreak.  \n \nBorders  were  closed  on  23 March,  and  a  national  state  of  emergency \nwas declared on 26 March 2020. It has since been renewed and was last \nextended  to  the  end  of  2020.  The  government's  Preparedness  and \nResponse  Plan  developed  in  February  2020  and  iterated  with  the \nevolution of the pandemic, covers coordination and response, prevention \n\n3.

The  plan  is  being  iterated  with  the  evolving  COVID-19 \nsituation.  \n \nHospitals have been upgraded, particularly isolation units, which for use \nas  intensive  care  units;  medical  personnel  are  trained  on  infection \nprevention, control, and contact tracing to improve surveillance; testing \nequipment  and  medical  supplies  have  been  procured;  and  public \nawareness  campaigns  are  underway.  Development  partners  have \nprovided funding to supplement the government's efforts. \n\nThe IMF\u2019s 2019 DSA found that Vanuatu was at moderate risk of debt \ndistress  and  could  take  on  more  concessional  borrowing.  Public  debt \nremains sustainable, but its rising trend adds to fiscal vulnerabilities.  \n \nADB's  DSA,  updated  in October  2020,  finds that  Vanuatu's short-term \ngrowth  prospects  have  deteriorated  with  COVID-19  and \nthat \ncountercyclical policy will sharply deteriorate fiscal balances. The DSA \nfinds that higher fiscal deficits put Vanuatu's public debt on a rising trend, \nwith public debt\u2013GDP projected to rise from 44.4% in 2019 to more than \n55.0% in 2020. The higher fiscal deficit will be partially offset by higher \neconomic  growth  over  the  longer  term.  The  DSA  concludes  that \nVanuatu's  public  debt  level  is  sustainable,  as  most  debt  is  on \nconcessional  terms.  Without  grant  support  for  Vanuatu,  public  debt  is \nlikely to reach unsustainable levels. \n \nPublic  external  debt  constitutes  about  70%  of  the  total  debt  stock \noutstanding. It is mostly contracted on concessional terms, which keeps \nborrowing costs low and limits rollover and interest-rate risks. However, \nthe  foreign-currency  denomination  of  the  external  debt  constitutes \ncurrency risk.  \n \nAdditional  risks  stem  from  the  country's  heavy  exposure  to  disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards. Air Vanuatu was financially exposed, and \nthe government was likely to be required to guarantee debt servicing.  \n \nIMF has assessed that Vanuatu remains at moderate risk of debt distress \npost-COVID-19,  and  risks  have  been  elevated  compared  to  its  2019 \nassessment.  \n\n\uf0fc \n\n6. \nCoordination  \n  with the IMF \n\n\uf0fc \n\nADB  and  IMF  collaborate  closely  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and \npolicy issues in Vanuatu.  \n \nThe IMF shares updates from missions and the IMF are updated about \nADB's  investment  pipeline  in  Vanuatu.
