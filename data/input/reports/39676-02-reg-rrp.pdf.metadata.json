It is also an integral part of the \nregional road network in Central Asia linking the Kyrgyz Republic, \nPRC,  Tajikistan,  Afghanistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Turkmenistan. \nMore  broadly,  it  is  a  part  of  the  Asian  highway  network \nconnecting,  through  Afghanistan,  the  ocean  ports  of  Iran  and \nPakistan \nthe  Russian  Federation.  The \nimmediate  project  area  where  the  road  sections  are  to  be \nimproved  is  in  the  Rash  Valley  northeast  of  Dushanbe  in \nTajikistan,  and  Alay  Valley  southwest  of  Osh  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  The  project  road  has  become  a  bottleneck  for  regional \ntrade  and  transport  due  to  its  poor  condition  and  lack  of \nmaintenance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting in \nrehabilitation of 217 km of this corridor in Tajikistan and 58 km in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  Corridor\u2019s  missing  links.  Its  outputs \ninclude (i) improved 263 km of the two-lane road from Sary Tash \nin the Kyrgyz Republic to Nimich in Tajikistan (about 142 km from \nSary  Tash  to  the  Kyrgyz-Tajik  border  and  121  km  from  the \nKyrgyz-Tajik  border  to  Nimich);  (ii)  improved  infrastructure  at  the \nKyrgyz-PRC  border  crossing  (Irkeshtam)  and  the  Kyrgyz-Tajik \nborder  crossing  (Karamik);  (iii) \nincreased  sustainability  and \ncapacity  of  the  road  subsector  through  outsourcing  maintenance \noperations  to  the  private  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nTajikistan;  and  (iv)  a  cross-border  agreement  among  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, PRC, and Tajikistan. \n \n\nto  Kazakhstan  and \n\n \nBorrowers/Recipients \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nThe project corridor is the most direct link from the PRC to Central \nand South Asia. It falls under Corridor 3 of the six priority corridors \nidentified under the Transport Sector Strategy of the Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  Program.  The  road  sections  to \nbe rehabilitated under the Project are in poor condition and restrict \ndomestic  and  international  traffic.  This  obstructs  trade  between \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and \nthe  Xinjiang  Uygur \nAutonomous  Region  of  the  PRC  and  other  neighboring  Central \nAsian countries. By improving the remaining road sections of the \ncorridor  from  Dushanbe  to  the  Kyrgyz-PRC  border  at  Irkeshtam, \nthe  Project  will  open  up  this  potentially  promising  corridor  for \nregional trade and cooperation.  \n \nIn  addition,  border  infrastructure  at  Karamik  and  Irkeshtam  are \ninadequate  to  handle  cross-border  traffic.  With  improved  road \nconditions, cross-border traffic is expected to rise. The Project will \nimprove  border  infrastructure  with  better  traffic  handling  facilities. \nIt  will  also  develop  a  cross-border  agreement  among  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan  to  streamline  and  simplify  border \nand customs procedures for smooth movement across borders.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  transport  costs  and \nfostering regional trade and cooperation among Kyrgyz Republic, \nPRC,  Tajikistan,  and  other  Central  Asian  countries.  The  project \noutcome  is  increased  regional  traffic  and  trade,  along  with \nimproved  access  to  regional  markets  and  social  services  for \npeople living along the Corridor. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nCivil Works \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nPerformance-Based Maintenance \n\nConsulting Services \n\nTaxes and Duties \n\nContingencies \n\nInterest During Construction \n\nTAJ \n\nKGZ \n\nTotal \n\n45.1 \n\n20.6 \n\n65.7 \n\n0.1 \n\n4.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n12.9 \n\n11.0 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n2.6 \n\n6.6 \n\n5.7 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.1 \n\n8.0 \n\n5.6 \n\n19.5 \n\n16.7 \n\n0.4 \n\nTotal \n\n76.5 \n\n39.5 \n\n116.0 \n\nKGZ = Kyrgyz Republic, TAJ = Tajikistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\n \n\niii\n\nSource \n\nADB Loan \n\nADB Grant \n\nGovernment of Kyrgyz Republic \n\nGovernment of Tajikistan \n\nTotal \n\nTAJ \n\nKGZ \n\nTotal \n\n40.9 \n\n12.5 \n\n0.0 \n\n23.1 \n\n76.5 \n\n0.0 \n\n25.6 \n\n13.9 \n\n0.0 \n\n39.5 \n\n40.9 \n\n38.1 \n\n13.9 \n\n23.1 \n\n116.0 \n\n ADB = Asian Development Bank, KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic,  \nTAJ = Tajikistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nKyrgyz  Republic  Component.

Civil works for the road improvement works \nhave been packaged into six contracts (three in each country) to \nbe  procured  following  ICB  procedures.  Contractors  will  be \nrequired  to  produce  detailed  design  and  working  drawings  under \neach  contract,  and  EAs  will  provide  detailed  survey  and \ninvestigation  details,  including  details  of  topographic  surveys, \ncarried out at the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \nstage.  A  border  infrastructure  improvement  component  has  been \npackaged  into  one  civil  works  contract  in  each  country,  and  the \nroad  maintenance \nperformance-based  maintenance \ncomponent  has  been  packaged  into  10  contracts  (five  in  each \ncountry).  Civil  works \ninfrastructure  and  PBM \ncomponents will be procured following national procurement laws \nof  the  respective  governments.  The  procurement  plan  will  be \nreviewed regularly, amended as necessary, and will cover at least \nthe next 18 months of the procurement activities during the project \nimplementation. All procurement to be financed by ADB under the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nfor  border \n\n(PBM) \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe Project will require a total of 683 person-months of consulting \nservices for the Tajikistan component and 430 person-months for \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  component.  Services  of  consulting  firms  will \nbe  provided  to  support  the  EAs  in  (i)  construction  supervision, \nincluding  training  for  the  private  sector  and  tendering  out  PBM \ncontracts;  (ii)  project  benefits  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (iii) \nproject  management.  International  consulting  services  for  65 \nperson-months  will  be  provided  for  the  Tajikistan  component  of \nthe  Project,  and  59  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \ncomponent. The international consulting services will be assisted \nby  568  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  for  the \nTajikistan  component  and  321  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  component.  Fifty  (twenty-five  in  each  country)  person-\nmonths  of  individual  international  consulting  services  and  50  (25 \nin  each  country)  of  individual  national  consulting  services  will  be \nprovided  for  the  Tajikistan  and  Kyrgyz  Republic  components  to \nin  privatization  and \nsupport  TAJMOTC  and  KGZMOTC \noutsourcing  road  maintenance  activities  to  the  private  sector.  All \nconsultants  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  substantially  reduce  the  obstruction  to  trade  and \nfacilitate  regional  trade  and  cooperation.  The  entire  region  will \nbenefit from the Project, while the immediate project area will gain \nthrough economic development and increased access to markets \nand  social  services.  Improvement  of  the  road  will  facilitate \nagricultural  production,  mining \nindustry  development,  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) for the overall Project is 18.1%, and the net present value \nis  $37.6  million.  Considering  benefits  accruing  separately,  EIRR \nfor  the  Tajikistan  component  is  17.9%,  and  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  component  is  14.5%.  Most  of  the  benefits  accrue  to \ninternational traffic (54%), followed by savings in road user costs \n(27%),  agricultural  production  (17%),  and  time  and  domestic \ngenerated  traffic  benefits  (2%).  Tajikistan  would  receive  70%  of \nproject  net  benefits,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  20.5%,  the  PRC  9.3%, \nand  Afghanistan  0.2%.  Due  to  the  Project,  trade  between  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  is  expected  to  grow  from  27,236 \ntons  in  2006  to  250,000  tons  in  2015,  Tajikistan-PRC  trade  from \n14,260  tons  in  2006  to  1  million  tons  in  2015,  and  PRC-\nAfghanistan trade from 0 to 500,000 tons in the same period.   \n \nWhile the Project does not directly target poverty reduction, it has \nindirect  benefits  for  the  poor  through  increased  mobility  and \naccessibility  to  markets  and  social  services  in  the  project  area; \nlower transport costs for inputs and products; better access to and \ninteraction  with  other  regions;  and  employment  opportunities \nduring  construction  and  after  completion  owing  to  increased  coal \nmining, urbanization, and other economic activities. Indirectly, the \nthree \nProject  will  benefit \n\n(i)  about  228,000  people \n\nfrom \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\ncommunities  in  Tajikistan,  of  whom  100,800,  or  44%,  are  poor; \nand (ii) about 29,000 people from two communities in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, of whom 52% are poor. Another quarter of beneficiaries \nare considered just above the poverty line.  \n \nKey  assumptions  are  (i)  continued  political  stability,  strong \neconomic  performance,  and  commitment  to  regional  cooperation \namong  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan;  (ii)  continued \nexternal assistance and governments\u2019 commitment to develop the \nroad  subsector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan;  and  (iii) \ntimely  provision  of  counterpart  funding  and  support  from  local \ngovernments and communities. The main project risks include: (i) \nforecast  international  traffic  does  not  materialize,  and  (ii)  cost \noverruns  may  occur  due  to  sharp  escalation  in  prices  for \nconstruction  materials  and  labor.  Given  the  current  economic \ndevelopment perspectives in the region and trends in the region\u2019s \ntrade and transport turnover, it is anticipated that forecasted traffic \nwould,  indeed,  materialize.  It  is  expected  that  the  economies  of \nthe  regional  countries  would  grow  at  least  at  the  same  pace  as \nthey  do  currently  and  most  likely  even  faster.  Reasonable  price \nescalation  factors  were  incorporated  into  the  cost  estimates  to \nminimize  the  risk  of  project  cost  overruns.  Based  on  the  current \ntrend in world prices for major construction inputs, the escalation \nof \nthe  reasonable  assumptions \nincorporated  into  the  project  costs  is  unlikely.  Based  on  these \nassumptions  and  the  likelihood  of  risks,  it  is  expected  that  the \nProject\u2019s benefits will outweigh its costs. \n \nThe Project will be accompanied by regional technical assistance \n(TA)  to  help  prepare  the  cross-border  agreement  (CBA)  among \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. The CBA will facilitate \nsmooth  transborder  movement  of  people  and  goods  and  will \nremove  nonphysical  barriers  to  regional  trade  and  transport.  The \noutcome  of  the  TA  is  a  CBA  signed  by  the  governments  of  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan  prior  to  completion  of  the \nphysical  works  under  the  Project.  The  TA  will  be  implemented \ninternational \nover  24  months  and \nconsultants for 24 person-months and national consultants for 10 \nperson-months. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram  in  the  amount  of  $500,000.  ADB  will  be  the  EA  for  the \nTA, and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic will provide an in-\nkind  contribution  estimated  at  $50,000  through  providing  office \nspace for the consultants, administrative support, and counterpart \nstaff.  \n\nthe  project  costs  beyond \n\nthe  services  of \n\nfinance \n\n\f \n\n\f\f \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant to the Kyrgyz Republic, and (ii) a proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for \nthe CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the development of a cross-border agreement among the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  and  Tajikistan,  and,  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loan  and  grants,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nThe  PRC\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013Tajikistan  road  corridor  (the  Corridor),  which  runs  from \n2. \nIrkeshtam  on  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  border  with  the  PRC  to  Dushanbe  and  is  approximately  550 \nkilometers  (km)  in  length,  is  a  key  transport  artery  for  the  two  landlocked  countries,  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  Tajikistan,  to  trade  with  the  PRC.  It  is  also  an  integral  part  of  the  regional  road \nnetwork  in  Central  Asia  linking  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  Tajikistan,  Afghanistan,  Uzbekistan, \nand  Turkmenistan.  More  broadly,  it  is  a  part  of  the  Asian  highway  network  connecting,  through \nAfghanistan, the ocean ports of Iran and Pakistan to Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.   \n \nThe Corridor is the most direct link from the PRC to Central and South Asia (para. 10). It \n3. \nfalls under Corridor 3 of the six priority corridors identified under the Transport Sector Strategy \nof  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  program.  Poor  road  conditions \nwithin  this  Corridor  are  bottlenecks  to  domestic  and  international  traffic.  In  particular,  they \nobstruct  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous \nRegion (Xinjiang) of the PRC and other neighboring Central Asian countries. By improving the \nremaining sections of the corridor from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz-PRC border at Irkeshtam, the \nProject will remove the  obstruction and open up this potentially promising corridor for regional \ntrade  and  cooperation.  Separate  feasibility  studies  were  prepared  through  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)1 for  each  country.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the proposed project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nTrade and Transport in Central Asia \n\nThe existing transport infrastructure in Central Asia was developed to serve the needs of \n4. \nthe  centrally  planned  economy  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  and  thus  was  oriented  more \ntowards the Russian Federation and Europe. This has created difficulties since independence, \nas  these countries  found  themselves  with  fragmented  transport  networks  that  frequently  cross \nand  recross  the  borders  of  neighboring  countries.  Also,  the  transport  corridors  had  not  been \ndeveloped in the past to link Central Asia with the PRC, thus restricting the trading potential in \nthe region. For similar reasons, and reflecting the frequently mountainous conditions, passage \nbetween Central Asia and South Asia had been even more restricted.  \n \n5. \nThe  region\u2019s  transportation  industry  suffered  economic  decline  in  the  past  decade,  the \nmajor  problem  being  a  disruption  of  the  economic  ties  among  the  newly  independent  Central \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.

Regional  Technical  Assistance  for  Maintenance  of \nRegional Road Transport Corridors Project. Manila (TA 6309-REG, approved on 9 March).  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAsian  Republics  (CARs).  This  resulted  in  a  sharp  reduction  in  transport  turnover  followed  by \nrapid deterioration of the infrastructure assets due to severe shortage of funds for maintenance \nand  improvement.  The  breakup  of  the  FSU\u2019s  centrally  planned  system  has  also  created \ninstitutional problems resulting in poor management and planning, inadequate staffing and high \nstaff turnover, and inadequate legal and regulatory systems.  \n \n6. \nTrade volumes in the CARs have more than doubled in recent years, rising from $17.7 \nmillion in 1999 to $44.5 million in 2005.2 By 2004, the overall level of trade (as measured by the \nratio of merchandise exports plus imports to gross domestic product) in all the CARs was higher \nthan  what  one  might  expect  given  their  size,  location,  and  per  capita  GDP. 3  Total  freight \nturnover has grown across the CARs from 145 billion ton-kilometers (ton-km) in 1999 to about \n250  billion  ton-km  in  2005.  Central  Asia\u2019s  generally  poor  road  network  conditions  limit  road \ntransport, which is reflected in about 80% of the region\u2019s transport volume being carried by rail.   \n \n\n2. \n\nPRC as an Emerging Trading Partner \n\nThe  PRC  has  emerged  as  a  major  trading  partner  for  the CARs,  but  so  far  only  as  an \n7. \nexporter. All countries in the region significantly increased their trade with the PRC during 2001\u2013\n2005. The PRC\u2019s overall share of imports into Central Asia4 rose from 2.7% in 2001 to 18.0% in \n2005, and that trend is likely to continue. The gain owes to the fast growing western regions of \nthe  PRC,  and  in  particular  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang),  along  with \nongoing  improvement  of  the  regional  corridors.  Most  of  the  traded  goods  are  carried  by  rail, \nwhich is inexpensive but circuitous and slow. International road transport is constrained by poor \nquality of roads and winding mountain passes, which limit both the size of vehicles and length of \ntime that the roads and border posts are at all passable during the winter months. \n \n8. \nThe  most  dramatic  increase  in  trade  with  the  PRC  has  been  exhibited  by  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  Tajikistan.  Table  1  below  shows  that  trade  with  the  PRC  in  2005  accounted  for \n$1.05  billion  (35.4%)  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  $158  million  (6.7%)  in  Tajikistan.  This \nrepresented 15-fold and 20-fold growth, respectively, compared to 2001. But in both countries \nthe rise has been disproportionately on the import side, with export-import ratios of 10:1 for the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  16:1  for  Tajikistan  in  2005.  Merchandise  imports  from  the  PRC  as  a \npercentage  of  GDP  in  2005  came  to  44.2%  and  11.3%,  respectively.  While  road  transport \ncarried 21,930 tons of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s imports from the PRC in 2005, only 12,200 tons of \nTajikistan\u2019s imports from the PRC in the same year were carried by road, and these were mainly \nvehicles  imported  under  their  own  power.  It  is  expected  that  once  the  road  corridor  and \nassociated border infrastructure and procedures are improved, the road share of imports from \nthe PRC will grow significantly and the proportion of exports will pick up gradually, especially as \npotential  mining  concessions  becoming  operational  in  the  project  area,  both  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan.5 \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Particularly  in  the  absence  of  a  rail  connection  into \nAfghanistan, the road route through the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan is the only transport link \nbetween the Kashi railhead in Xinjiang and Kabul in Afghanistan. \n \n\n11,074 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\u2013 \n291.9 \n\n3. \n\nThe Corridor as Part of the Regional Road Network \n\n10. \nThe  Corridor  is  an integral  part  of  the  regional road  network  in  Central  Asia  and is  the \nonly bottleneck that, if removed, will reduce travel distances and time along two major regional \nroad  corridors  extending  from  Russia,  Kazakhstan,  and  the  PRC  in  the  north  to  Afghanistan, \nPakistan,  and  Iran  in  the  south  across  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  (see  Regional \nTransport  Corridors  Map).  First  corridor  originates  at  Kashi  in  the  PRC,  leads  to  Dushanbe  in \nTajikistan, continues on to Kabul in Afghanistan, and finally reaches ocean ports in Pakistan and \nIran.  Distance  from  Kashi  to  Kabul  along  this  corridor  is  about  1,395  km  and  passes  through \nless  difficult  terrain  conditions  as  compared  to  the  1,810-km  Karakorum  Highway  corridor. \nSecond corridor is 1,098 km long and originates at Almaty in Kazakhstan, then passes through \nBishkek  and  Osh  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  until  it  reaches  Sary  Tash,  where  it  joins  the  first \ncorridor. Almost the entire length of both corridors, except the project road sections, are being \nimproved  or  funds  have  been  secured  for  rehabilitation.  Once  all  planned  improvements  are \ncompleted,  the  travel  time  along  these  corridors  will  shorten  from  about  5  days  to  3  days.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nparticular, travel time from Kashi to Dushanbe will shorten from 13 hours to 8 hours. In addition, \nthe project road is part of a major international corridor that will potentially link the PRC with the \nPersian  Gulf. 7  Clearly,  completing  the  remaining  links  of  this  regional  corridor  offers  new \nopportunities  to  intensify  regional  cooperation.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  will  greatly \nbenefit from the Project by becoming conduits of regional trade.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints in the Transport Sector \n\n11. \nTransport  sectors  of  both  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have  similar  constraints \nand challenges. Both countries are situated in mountainous and landlocked landscapes, suffer \nfrom  frequent  climatic  calamities,  operate  inefficiently  with  little  maintenance,  and  face  severe \nshortage in capital investments. At the same time, they are confronted with growing demand for \nregional access and trade. Both countries are strategically located to serve the transit needs of \ntheir  fast  growing  neighbors,  such  as  Kazakhstan  and  the  PRC.  Key  challenges  that  these \ncountries  must  overcome  to  fully  realize  their  aspirations  as  conduits  of  regional  trade  are  (i) \nremoving  barriers  to  regional  trade  and  cooperation,  (ii)  building  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport  systems,  and  (iii)  catching  up  on  the  accumulated  shortfall  in  sector  financing  and \ninvestment.  As  both  countries\u2019  transport  sectors  are  dominated  by  road  transport,  these \nchallenges are all directly linked to the road subsector. Subsector analyses for each country are \npresented in Appendix 2. \n  \n\na. \n\nRemoving Barriers to Regional Trade and Cooperation  \n\n12. \nThe Central Asian countries need to trade not only among themselves but also to reach \nbeyond traditional FSU markets. Recognizing this urgent need, these countries have embarked \nupon developing their transport links with their nontraditional trading partners in the region. They \nhave  made  strong  commitments  toward  achieving  this  objective  at  various  venues  promoting \nregional cooperation. The Kyrgyz Republic, PRC and Tajikistan, as active members of the ADB-\nsponsored  CAREC  program,  confirmed  their  commitments  to  \u201cworking  together  for  trade \nopenness, transport corridors for integrating the region and connecting to external markets, and \nfor  developing  and  sharing  the  region\u2019s  energy  resources\u201d  during  the  Fourth  Ministerial \nConference  in  Bishkek  in  2005.  The  CAREC  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Statement8 called  for \nproviding  safe,  dependable,  effective,  efficient,  and  fully  integrated  transport  operations  and \ninfrastructure  with  three  overarching  goals:  (i)  establishing  competitive  transport  corridors \nacross  the  CAREC  region;  (ii)  facilitating  efficient  movement  of  people  and  goods  across \nborders,  and  (iii)  developing  safe,  people-friendly  transport  systems.  Cross-border  transport \nprocedures are being addressed under the ADB-financed Regional Customs Modernization and \nInfrastructure Development Project,9 and developing a harmonized regulatory framework is one \nissue  addressed  as  part  of  the  Transport  Sector  Coordination  Committee  work  under  the \nCAREC  program.  With  loans  from  ADB  and  other  donors,  major  corridor  improvements  are \nunderway  accompanied  by  ongoing  policy  dialogue  to  introduce  reforms  for  better  sector \nfunding and management.  \n\n                                                 \n7  Planned improvement of the Dushanbe\u2013Tursunzade Road (Uzbek border), which is included as a firm project for \n2009  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Operations  and  Business  Plan,  2007\u20132009  for Tajikistan,  will  open  a  land  access  to  Iran \nand Turkey through Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.   \n\n8  CAREC. 8-9 September 2007.

Manila. \n\n\fIn  addition,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  active  participants  in  other  regional \n13. \ninitiatives, such as the Road Transport Facilitation Agreement under the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization which is currently being negotiated, the Transit Transport Framework Agreement \nunder  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization,  the  European  Union\u2019s  Transport  Corridor \nEurope-Caucasus-Asia  program,  and  the  UN-ESCAP  program.  All  of  these  promote  regional \ncooperation and specifically deal with trade and transport issues in the Central Asian countries. \nBesides the PRC\u2019s emerging as a major trading partner in the region fueled with Kazakhstan\u2019s \noil-rich economy, there is vast potential for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to play key roles \nin bringing the external markets closer to Central Asia. \n \n\nb. \n\nEfficient and Integrated Transport Systems \n\nAn efficient and integrated transport system is the objective of both the Kyrgyz Republic \n14. \nand Tajikistan, which is reflected in their respective transport sector policy papers. This is also \nthe objective of the CAREC regional transport sector strategy10 that is under development with \nADB  support.  Issues  that  limit  transport  efficiency  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are \nsimilar  and  include  (i)  weak  strategies  and  regulations;  (ii)  poor  condition  of  roads  and \ninadequate  maintenance;  (iii)  inadequate  planning,  management,  and  operating  tools;  and  (iv) \nlimited institutional capacity and human resource constraints.  \n \n15.  Weak  Strategies  and  Regulations.  ADB  has  been  intensively  involved  in  policy \ndialogue  with  both  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan.  In  Tajikistan,  as  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s \nadvisory  TA,11 the  transport  sector  policy  was  formulated  and  administration  of  the  transport \nsector  was  reorganized  with  creation  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  in  2001.  Similarly,  ADB  was \ninstrumental in the Kyrgyz Republic in introducing market-based reforms in the transport sector \nand  developing  transport  and  road  sector  policy  statements. 12  Nonetheless,  strategies  to \nsupport  policies  remain  weak  and  regulations  are  inconsistent.  Strategies  focus  narrowly  on \nambitious outputs with little linkage to the available resources, both financial and human. ADB is \nassisting the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to formulate adequate strategies and programs to \nachieve  sector  policy  objectives.  ADB  recently  approved  TA  for  Tajikistan  for  developing  a \ntransport  sector  master  plan 13  to  formulate  strategic  priorities  in  the  sector.  In  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  the  Government  is  considering  a  road  subsector  strategy 14  prepared  with  the \nassistance of ADB-financed TA.15 \n \n16. \nInadequate  Planning  and  Management.  Although  the  economies  of  the  countries \nmade a transition to an open market, the planning and management tools remained unchanged \nand  continued  to  function  under  the  command  methods.  Priorities  were  driven  so  far  by  the \nimperative  to  link  different  parts  of  the  country  or  provide  regional  access.  Virtually  no \nprioritization  and  planning  methodologies  exist  either  under  Tajik  or  Kyrgyz  ministries  of \ntransport and communications. There is a need to introduce new market-oriented planning tools \nalong  with  modern  management  and  operating  practices.  ADB  is  assisting  the  MOTCs  in \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006.

Institutional  capacity  and  human  resource  constraints \n17. \nlimit the introduction of best practices in the transport sector, including planning, management, \noperation,  and  maintenance.  The  sector  financial  management  capacity  is  weak.  International \naccounting and auditing procedures have  yet to be followed. The sector is losing experienced \nmanagerial  and  technical  resources  because  of  low  salaries  and  lack  of  incentives.  A  sound \ninstitutional and human resources development plan is essential to sustainable development in \nthe transport sector. The transport sector master plan (footnote 13) for Tajikistan will assess the \ncurrent  situation  and  include  a  viable  plan  for  institutional  capacity  development  through  both \nchanges in the institutional environment and targeted training. In the Kyrgyz Republic, this will \nbe addressed by the newly proposed strategy (footnote 14) \n \n\nc. \n\nAccumulated Sector Financing Shortfall \n\n18. \nBoth  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  various  studies  and  governments\u2019  own \nassessments indicate that about 80% of the road network is rated as in \u201cpoor\u201d condition. That is \na  major  constraint  on  the  countries\u2019  economic  and  social  development.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic \nreported in its draft road sector strategy paper (footnote 14) an alarming loss of about 1,000 km \nof asphalt-surfaced roads over 5 years. In Tajikistan, aggravated by civil war that erupted in the \n1990s,  a  recent  study17 financed  by  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development \nestimated a loss of road infrastructure assets worth about $1.2 billion since 1990. The severe \nfiscal constraints limited budget allocations for improving and maintaining roads at only 20% of \nthe required funding level. The governments rely heavily on external funding, which amounted \nto $260 million in the Kyrgyz Republic and $500 million in Tajikistan over the last 10 years. In \nthe same strategy paper, the Kyrgyz Republic reported needing over $1 billion to rehabilitate its \n2,242 km of major road corridors and annual maintenance funding of $48 million over the next 5 \nyears  to  bring  its  devastated  road  network  back  into  a  maintainable  condition.  The  annual \nfunding level required to keep Tajikistan\u2019s 3,135 km of major roads maintained is estimated at \n$32  million  (TA  4294-TAJ,  footnote  16),  with  a  further  $1  billion  for  rehabilitation.  It  is  a \nparamount challenge for the two governments to catch up after this underspending and secure \nfunding  needed  to  achieve  their  objectives.  They  recognize  the  urgency  of  reforms  and \nchanges.  The  way  forward  is  to  raise  sufficient  revenues  by  introducing  revenue  generating \nmechanisms  and  involve  the  private  sector  to  efficiently  utilize  available  funding.  It  is  also \nimportant for the governments to effectively plan and prioritize capital investments and increase \ncapacity  to  efficiently  implement  them.  The  proposed  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  the \nshortfall in capital investment in the two countries and complete the remaining part of this key \ncorridor.    \n   \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and ADB Strategies \n\n19. \nThe Project will be the  fourth ADB-financed project in the road subsector for Tajikistan \nand  the  fifth  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  ADB\u2019s  key  theme  is  connectivity,  and  the  Project  is  fully \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2003.

The  Project  directly  supports  two  of  the  four  strategic  objectives  \nidentified  in  the  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Programs: 18  (i)  increasing  trade  and \nintegration  with  large  markets  in  South  Asia,  the  PRC,  Iran,  Turkey,  and  the  Russian \nFederation;  and  (ii)  improving  economic  cooperation  to  reduce  transport  costs  and  facilitate \ntrade and transit, allowing Central Asian countries to become integrated and use their location \nto  their  advantage.  Transport  sector  development  is  also  a  priority  focus  in  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategies for both countries. \n \n20. \nPolicy  directives  of  both  governments  require  development  of  the  respective  transport \nsectors  to  be  based  on  market-oriented  reforms  and  restructuring  to  improve  efficiency.  The \ngovernments\u2019  strategies  include  developing  international  road  corridors  to  facilitate  external \ntrade  and  transit  traffic,  as  well  as  to  establish  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  encourage \nprivate  sector  participation  in  transport.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  transport  sector \nstrategies of both governments and is included in their respective public investment programs.  \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s loans in the road subsector totaled $64.5 million to Tajikistan and $145 million to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, all of which are for rehabilitation of road corridors from Bishkek (capital of \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic)  to  Dushanbe  (capital  of  Tajikistan).  ADB  is  a  leading  lender  to  both \ncountries.  Other  major  lenders  include  the  World  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Kuwait \nFund,  Saudi  Fund,  Republic  of  Iran,  and  the  PRC.  Appendix  3  summarizes  the  external \nassistance to the road subsector.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n22. \nADB  has  been  engaged  in  the  countries\u2019  transport  sectors  for  more  than  10  years  by \nfinancing a number of road rehabilitation projects and TAs. Based on the previous projects, the \nfollowing  major  lessons  can  be  drawn:  (i)  inexperience  of  the  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs)  on  procurement-related  issues  and  nonavailability  of  advance  action  at  the  time  of \nproject  preparation  that  led  to  implementation  delays;  (ii)  creating  separate  PIUs  for  individual \nprojects  that  led  to  ineffective  work  balance  among  PIUs  and  discontinuity  in  business \nprocesses; (iii) ineffective assurances for securing adequate funding for road maintenance; and \n(iv)  delays  due  to  loan  effectiveness  assurances,  such  as  signing  a  cross-border  agreement \n(CBA),  as  was  the  case  with  the  Almaty-Bishkek  Regional  Road  Rehabilitation  Project.19 In \naddition, lessons from ADB infrastructure projects in Greater Mekong Subregion countries have \nbeen taken into account in the project design. The project design incorporates these lessons as \nfollows:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe PIUs have now gained considerable experience and are increasingly familiar \nwith ADB policies and procedures. It was agreed with the governments that the \nProject  will  be  implemented  by  the  same  PIUs  and  thus,  the  continuity  in \nbusiness processes and, most importantly, PIUs\u2019 personnel will be ensured.  \nIn  general,  funding  for  road  maintenance  has  improved.  In  line  with  loan \ncovenants  attached  to  ADB-financed  projects,  governments  have  increased \nallocations  for  road  maintenance  at  an  agreed  rate  annually.  The  Project  will \ncontinue to encourage the increase in road maintenance financing. \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2004.

The immediate project area encompassing \nthe road sections to be improved is in the Rash Valley northeast of Dushanbe in Tajikistan and \nthe Alay Valley southwest of Osh in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n25. \nThe  Project  outputs  comprise  (i)  263  km  of  improved  two-lane  road  from  Sary  Tash  in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic to Nimich in Tajikistan (about 142 km from Sary Tash to the Kyrgyz-Tajik \nborder  at  Karamik  and  about  121  km  from  Karamik  border  to  Nimich);  (ii)  improved \ninfrastructure and facilities at the Kyrgyz-PRC border crossing (Irkeshtam) and the Kyrgyz-Tajik \nborder  crossing  (Karamik);  (iii)  increased  sustainability  and  capacity  of  the  road  subsectors \nthrough  outsourcing  maintenance  operations  to  the  private  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nTajikistan; and (iv) a cross-border agreement among the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. \n \n26. \nComponent A: Road Improvement. Sections of the road corridor to be improved under \nthe Project are located between Nimich, some 217 km northeast of Dushanbe in Tajikistan, and \nSary  Tash,  approximately  120  km  southeast  of  Osh  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  road  section \nfrom Nimich to the Kyrgyz-Tajik border is 121 km long (km 217-338). It continues from the end \nof the section that is being rehabilitated under ADB-financed Phase II of the rehabilitation of the \nDushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road (footnote 6) until it reaches the border checkpoint, about 12 km \nbefore the physical borderline that is also being improved under Phase II. The road section in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic is 142 km long (km 350-492)  and continues from the Kyrgyz-Tajik border \nuntil it reaches Sary Tash, at the end of the ongoing ADB-financed Southern Transport Corridor \nproject.20 This two-lane road passes along riverbanks almost throughout its entire length, except \nfor  the  mountain  pass  at  the  Kyrgyz-Tajik  border,  and  suffers  from  unstable  geological \nconditions and erosion of riverbanks from frequent floods. Originally almost entirely sealed with \nbituminous pavement, the road has deteriorated to the extent that some sections have lost the \nbituminous  surfacing  and  at  some  locations  the  road  is  barely  a  track.  The  civil  works  for \nimprovement  of  road  sections  on  km  217-338  will  include  reconstruction  of  asphalt  concrete \npavement,  reinforcement  of  embankment,  slope  rehabilitation  and  protection  measures, \ninstallation of drainage systems, construction of new and rehabilitation of existing bridges, and \nroad  safety  measures.  Civil  works  for  road  sections  on  km  350-492  will  vary  and  include \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n\fImprovement.  The  Project  will \n\nComponent  B:  Road  Maintenance \n\nrehabilitation  of  existing  bituminous  pavement  on  km  462-492  and  reconstruction  of  existing \ngravel  pavements  over  the  remaining  length,  including  significant  river  protection  works, \nimprovement  of  drainage  systems,  and  road  safety  measures.  The  Project  will  also  replace  9 \nseriously  deteriorated  bridges,  repair  12  bridges,  and  build  4  new  bridges.  All  the  civil  works \nhave  been  designed  to  comply  with  respective  national  highway  design  and  construction \nstandards as well as widely used international standards.21  \n \n27. \nimprove \nsustainability  of  the  road  subsector  by  introducing  and/or  enhancing  outsourcing  of  road \nmaintenance activities to the private sector. The governments are making efforts to tender out \nroad maintenance activities to the private sector, but the private sector\u2019s capacity is low and the \nenabling environment for its engagement is lacking. The scope and funding for such works are \nnot conducive to private sector participation. For the private sector to successfully engage in this \nopportunity, there should be (i) a capacity building program, both within the private sector and \nthe  road  agency;  and  (ii)  attractive  incentives  (i.e.,  scope  and  funding  should  encourage  the \nprivate  sector  to  invest  in  new  equipment  and  acquire  adequate  skills).  The  Project\u2019s  capacity \nbuilding  component  will  have  two  intervention  levels.  The  first  intervention  will  be  through  the \nconstruction supervision consultant\u2019s contract for road improvement works, which will include a \ntraining program for the private sector contractors in (i) best international contracting practices,22 \n(ii)  preparing  bids  for  performance  and/or  output-based  road  maintenance  contracts,  and  (iii) \ncontract management and execution. The second intervention will be at the Executing Agency \n(EA)  level.  This  will  require  recruiting  a  management  consultant  to  assist  the  EA  in  (i) \nintroducing  institutional  reforms;  (ii)  developing  a  program  for  road  maintenance  privatization \nand outsourcing; and (iii) design, preparation, and administration of performance and/or output-\nbased contracts. The management consultant will work closely with the EA and be responsible \nfor  all  activities  leading  to  privatizing  and  outsourcing  road  maintenance  activities.  These  two \ninterventions  will  support  each  other  and  be  coordinated  closely.  To  facilitate  an  enabling \nenvironment  and  greater  interest  from  private  sector  contractors,  the  Project  will  introduce \nperformance-based maintenance (PBM) on a pilot basis (para. 32).  \n \n28. \nComponent  C:  Border  Infrastructure  Development.  The  border  infrastructure  and \nfacilities at the Karamik border post are inadequate and poorly equipped to handle cross-border \ntraffic. Due to poor road conditions, the traffic is minimal and therefore the Karamik border post \nhas received inadequate funding and least priority from the Government of Tajikistan. There is \nonly a simple structure with basic amenities to house a few customs and border officials. In fact, \nfew border posts in Tajikistan have permanent structures designed for customs operations, nor \ndo  they  have  the  equipment  necessary  for  detailed  inspection  of  cargo  or  communications \nequipment to support operations. Selected border posts in Tajikistan will be improved under the \nADB-financed  Regional  Customs  Modernization  and  Infrastructure  Development  project  (Loan \n2114-TAJ)  (footnote  9).  This  will  involve  (i)  developing  the  Unified  Automated  Information \nSystem,  and  (ii)  improving  border  post  infrastructure.  The  Project  will  improve  border \ninfrastructure at the Karamik border post, and customs equipment and automated systems will \nbe provided under Loan 2114-TAJ in order for it to be compatible with a centralized system. In \ncontrast, cross-border traffic at the Kyrgyz-PRC border is considerably higher, and therefore it \nhas  received  better  funding  from  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  through  donor \nassistance.  Due  to  the  growing  cross-border  traffic  and  demand  for  speedy  border  crossing, \nhowever,  there  is  a  need  to  further  improve  border  infrastructure  for  handling  cross-border \n\n                                                 \n21 Such  as  British  Standards  (BS)  and  standards  developed  by  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and \n\nTransportation Officials (AASHTO).  \n\n22 Such as FIDIC contracts of International Federation of Consulting Engineers. http://www.fidic.org/. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ntraffic. Cross-border trade and transit will be facilitated by a cross-border agreement among the \ncountries as discussed in para. 29. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nCross-Border Agreement  \n\n29. \nTo  facilitate  regional  economic  cooperation,  the  governments  recognize  the  need  for \nremoving physical and nonphysical cross-border barriers. For this purpose, the CBA is needed \nto  regulate  and  ease  the  movement  of  people  and  goods  across  borders.  It  would  cover  (i) \nfacilitating  border  crossing  formalities,  (ii)  cross-border  movement  of  people  and  goods,  (iii) \nrequirements  for  admitting  road  vehicles,  (iv)  exchange  of  commercial  traffic  rights,  (v) \ninfrastructure, (vi) institutional issues, and (vii) miscellaneous provisions. This will be facilitated \nby proposed regional TA (para. 53).  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutsourcing Road Maintenance  \n\n30. \nRoad  maintenance,  both  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  has  traditionally  been \ncarried  out  by  maintenance  units  under  the  government\u2019s  line  ministry  responsible  for  the \ntransport sector, using force-account procedures. Facing severe fiscal constraints and realizing \nthe inefficiency of the existing system, the governments seek to improve road maintenance and \nits financing. In particular, they recognize that transferring road maintenance operations to the \ncompetitive private sector would lead to efficient utilization of scarce resources.  \n \nADB  supported  strengthening  road  maintenance  and  financing  through  policy  dialogue \n31. \nand  advisory  technical  assistance,  both  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan.  Ongoing  ADB-\nfinanced  projects  included  loan  covenants  to  encourage  implementing  the  recommended \nmeasures  to  improve  road  maintenance.  They  required  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  to \nincrease  financing  for  road  maintenance  by  15%  annually,  whereas  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  it \nwas  set  to  increase  at  least  at  the  same  rate  as  increases  in  the  overall  national  budget. \nAlthough  the  governments  have  made  substantial  progress  in  improving  road  maintenance \nfinancing,  given  the  size  of  the  road  network,  the  difficult  mountainous  terrain,  and  continued \nbudgetary constraints relative to demand, further work is needed to improve road maintenance. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  develop  and  implement  a  program  on  outsourcing  road  maintenance \noperations to the domestic private sector. This will be achieved through a two-pronged approach \n(para. 27), and introduce PBM contracts to be tendered to the domestic private sector on a pilot \nbasis.  The  program  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  at  an  investment  cost  of  $8  million  ($4 \nmillion in each country). The PBM contracts will cover approximately 1,000 km of roads (500 km in \neach country). These segments may be selected along the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border, Osh\u2013Sary \nTash\u2013Irkeshtam, and Sary Tash\u2013Karamik roads, as well as on other roads directly linking to them. \nIn the first year, the program will develop the outsourcing program; provide necessary training to \nthe  private  sector,  KGZMOTC,  and  TAJMOTC;  select  roads  for  maintenance  under  PBM;  and \nprepare PBM contract packages. The PBM contracts will be awarded in the second year and for \nperiods of about 4 years. Roads included in the PBM will undergo periodic maintenance in the first \nyear  and  routine  and  recurrent  maintenance  in  the  following  years. 23  ADB  will  finance  the \npreparation  works  via  a  consulting  services  contract  for  the  construction  supervision  and \ninstitutional  support  component.  Financing  for  the  PBM  contracts  will  come  from  EAs\u2019  regular \nbudgets  for  road  maintenance,  and  the  Project  will  catalyze  maintenance  funds  and,  thus, \n\n                                                 \n23 Types of road maintenance are explained in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n\ffacilitate greater interest from the private sector to participate in road sector development. This \nwill ensure sustainable financing after the Project is completed. The concept of PBM contracts is \nadopted  from  the  Road  Network  Development  Project24 in  Nepal,  with  necessary  modifications, \nand is described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe project investment cost including taxes and duties is estimated at $116 million. The \nTajikistan  component  is  estimated  at  $76.5  million  and  Kyrgyz  Republic  component  at  $39.5 \nmillion.

The  existing  PIUs25 under  each  of  the  EAs  will  (i) \nmonitor the progress of day-to-day project implementation, (ii) prepare withdrawal applications, \n(iii) prepare project progress reports, and (iv) maintain project accounts and complete financial \nrecords  for  auditing  the  Project.  The  directors  of  the  existing  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  the \nday-to-day  supervision  of  implementation  activities.  The  PIU  directors  will  be  supported  by \nadditional professional staff26 that will appointed prior to mobilization of the civil works contracts. \nExisting PIUs will also be responsible for advance contracting activities. The PBM components \nof the Project will be implemented by the roads departments of the TAJMOTC and KGZMOTC, \n\n                                                 \n25 KGZMOTC  has  combined  all  PIUs  under  the  single  Project  Implementation  Department  for  all  transport  sector \n\ninvestments projects under the Order 68 dated 9 April 2007. \n\n26 Both MOTC PIUs will require staff with expertise and experience in road engineering, construction supervision, and \nmonitoring  social  safeguards.  In  addition,  TAJMOTC  PIU  will  require  accounting,  procurement  specialist,  and \nsupport staff. \n\n\fwhich  will  be  supported  by  the  individual  consultants  engaged  under  the  institutional  support \ncomponent  of  the  Project.  Existing  PIUs  will  play  coordinating  roles  and  provide  necessary \nsupport  to  the  roads  departments,  in  particular  to  (i)  coordinate  communication  between  ADB \nand  the  roads  departments;  (ii)  assist  roads  departments  in  matters  related  to  the  contracts \nprocurement;  and  (iii)  report  on  the  implementation  of  the  PBM  component  quarterly  to  ADB, \nMOTC, and the Ministry of Finance with inputs from roads departments. ADB has been working \nclosely with the EAs for several years on other road projects and believes the EAs have, with \nconsultants\u2019  support,  the  required  capacity  to  manage  the  Project  effectively.  Tajikistan\u2019s \nCustoms  Service  and  Kyrgyz  State  Customs  Committee  are  currently  implementing  the  ADB-\nfinanced  Regional  Customs  Modernization  and  Infrastructure  Development  Project  and  will  be \nthe  EAs  for  implementing  the  border  facility  improvement  component,  with  the  existing  PIUs \nproviding  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  respective  project  components.  Road  and  border \nimprovement components will be closely coordinated among the EAs. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  January  2008  to  March \n39. \n2013. The road corridor improvement works will be implemented in (i) 34 months from January \n2008  to  October  2010  under  the  Tajikistan  component,  and  (ii)  31  months  from  April  2008  to \nOctober 2010 under the Kyrgyz Republic component. This includes contractors mobilization but \nnot  the  defects  liability  period.  The  PBM  components  in  both  countries will  be  implemented  in \nabout  4  years,  from  2009  to  2013.  The  border  infrastructure  improvement  works  will  be \nimplemented  during  2009\u20132010  to  be  completed  in  parallel  with  road  improvement  works. \nSummary implementation schedules are shown in Appendix 5. To ensure that project activities \nare initiated and completed on a timely basis, detailed implementation plans, including activities \nand  a  resources  tracking  system,  are  given  in  Appendix  6.  These  schedules  will  be  further \nrefined  during  the  project  inception  mission  and  uploaded  to  the  project  website  for  joint \nmonitoring by the Government and ADB.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n40. \nContracts  estimated  at  $1.0  million  and  more  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  (ICB),  and  contracts  estimated  from  $100,000  to \nless than $1.0 million will be procured following national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nas  described  in  the  Project\u2019s  procurement  plan  (Appendix  7).  Civil  works  for  the  road \nimprovement  works  have  been  packaged  into  six  contracts  (three  in  each  country)  to  be \nprocured following ICB procedures. Contractors will be required to produce detailed design and \nworking  drawings  under  the  contract;  and  EAs  will  provide  detailed  survey  and  investigation \ndetails,  including  details  of  topographic  surveys,  carried  out  at  the  PPTA  stage.  The  border \ninfrastructure improvement component has been packaged into one civil works contract in each \ncountry, and the PBM road maintenance component has been packaged into 10 contracts (five \nin  each  country).  Civil  works  for  border  infrastructure  and  PBM  components  will  be  procured \nfollowing  national  procurement  laws  of  the  respective  countries.  The  procurement  plan  will  be \nreviewed  regularly,  amended  as  necessary,  and  cover  at  least  the  next  18  months  of \nprocurement  activities  during  project  implementation.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  by  ADB \nunder the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nAs  the  governments  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  accord  high  priority  to  the \n41. \nProject and aim for its timely completion, ADB approved advance contracting for civil works. The \nadvance  contracting,  up  to  but  not  including  signing  of  contracts,  will  cover  tendering  and  bid \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fevaluation  for  the  civil  works  contract  packages.  The  governments  have  been  advised  that \nADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  and  finance  the \nproject or the procurement cost. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nThe  Project  will  require  total  of  683  person-months  of  consulting  services  for  the \nTajikistan\u2019s  component  and  430  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  component.  Consulting \nfirm  services  will  be  provided  for  (i)  construction  supervision,  including  training  for  the  domestic \nprivate  sector  and  tendering  out  PBM  contracts;  (ii)  project  benefits  monitoring  and  evaluation; \nand  (iii)  project  management.  International  consulting  services  for  65  person-months  will  be \nprovided  for  the  Tajikistan  component  of  the  Project  and  59  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  component.  These  consultants  will  also  provide  on-the-job  training  for  the  counterpart \nstaff.  The  international  consulting  services  will  be  assisted  by  568  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services for the Tajikistan component and 321 person-months for the Kyrgyz Republic \ncomponent.  National  consultants  will  provide  expertise  in  construction  supervision  and  contract \nmanagement,  and  will  monitor  the  social  and  poverty  impacts  of  the  Project  through  household \nsurveys and data analysis. Outline terms of references for consulting services are in Appendix 8. \nFifty  (twenty-five  in  each  country)  person-months  of  individual  international  consulting  services \nand  50  (25  in  each  country)  person-months  of  individual  national  consulting  services  will  be \nprovided  each  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  components  to  support  TAJMOTC  and \nKGZMOTC in outsourcing road maintenance activities to the private sector and introducing best \npractices  in  preventive  road  maintenance.  Outline  terms  of  references  for  individual  consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix B. All consultants to be financed under the Project will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n   \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n43. \nThe  ADB  loan  and  grant  proceeds  for  the  proposed  Project  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2007, as amended from time to \ntime). To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, imprest accounts will be established \nupon loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and will be exclusively used to \nfinance  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  For  the  Tajikistan  component,  the  grant  imprest \naccount  will  be  used  mostly  for  consulting  services  and  will  be  managed  by  TAJMOTC. \nKGZMOTC  will  manage  an  imprest  account  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  component.  The  initial \nadvance to be deposited to the imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  and/or  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  To  expedite  funds \nflow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be \nused for liquidating and replenishing the imprest account for eligible expenditures not exceeding \n$50,000  per  individual  payment.  The  payments  in  excess  of  statement  of  expenditures  ceiling \nwill  be  liquidated  or  replenished  based  on  the  supporting documentation  process. For  the  civil \nworks contracts under the Project, direct payment procedures will apply. \n  \nFinancial  management  assessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  of  each  EA  was \n44. \nconducted  and  it  concluded  that  the  associated  risks  are  low  due  to  their  considerable \nexperience  with  donor-funded  projects.  Timely  disbursement  of  the  governments\u2019  counterpart \nfunding  for  the  Project  and  hiring  and  retaining  competent  financial  management  staff  were \nidentified as particular concerns, and the specific assurances for the Project duly reflect this. \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fADB  financing  under  the  Project  will  be  utilized  in  accordance  with  the  tables  to \n45. \nschedules 3A and 3B of the Financing Agreement for the Tajikistan component and Schedule \n2A of the Grant Agreement for the Kyrgyz Republic component. The Tajikistan component will \nbe financed from two different funding sources, specifically:  \n\nthe civil works category will be financed from two funding sources and co-shared \nbetween  ADB  grant  (22%)  and  ADB  loan  (78%),  which  will  be  applied  to  every \nclaim. To withdraw the funds from three different sources, a separate withdrawal \napplication needs to be submitted for payment from ADB loan and ADB grant. To \npromote  efficiency  in  processing  disbursements  from  three  different  sources \nunder the Project, a minimum value per withdrawal application is set at $100,000 \nequivalent or the amount determined to be a reasonable minimum; and \nthe consulting services category will be financed 100% from the ADB grant. \n\n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n6. \n\n46. \nThe  EAs  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on \nproject  implementation  in  the  format  and  content  agreed  with  ADB.  The  EAs  will  maintain \nseparate accounts for all project components and have these audited by an independent auditor \nwith adequate knowledge and experience of international accounting practices and acceptable \nto ADB. The audited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports, including a separate opinion on \nuse  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures,  will  be  provided  to \nADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The governments have been informed of \nADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of audited project accounts and financial statements, \nincluding the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. To facilitate evaluation of \nthe  Project,  the  governments  agreed  to  provide  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  3 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s physical completion. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n47. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the officials of the two governments and the EAs. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  and/or  grant  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The \ngovernments are committed to creating and sustaining a corruption-free environment and have \nagreed  to  abide  by  the  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  in  preparing  all \ndocuments and contracts during the bidding process and project implementation.  \n \n48. \nAs  an  additional  measure  to  improve  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency \nunder  the  project,  the  EAs  will  establish  a  website  that  will  present  information  on  externally \nfunded  projects.  For  this  project,  the  website  will  provide  information  on,  among  others, \nprocurement  activities  including  lists  of  participating  bidders  and/or  consultants,  names  of \nwinning  bidders  and/or  consultants,  basic  details  on  bidding  and/or  recruitment  procedures \nadopted,  amounts  of  contracts  awarded,  lists  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  and  those \nitems\u2019 intended use. \n  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n49. \nADB  and  the  EAs  agreed  upon  a  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its  impacts  and  outcomes  as  indicated  in  the \nProject\u2019s design and monitoring framework. At the beginning of project implementation, the EAs \nwill confirm baseline values for social and economic impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will \nbe  measured,  with  the  necessary  frequency,  during  project  implementation.  Comments  and \nfindings regarding these project indicators will be incorporated into each annual report to ADB. \nIn  addition  to  indicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be \nmeasured  at  project  completion  as  well  as  1  year  and  3  years  after  completion.  Participatory \nsurveys  will  take  place,  and  results  will  be  compared  with  the  baseline.  A  final  report  will \nevaluate  changes  that  occurred  in  the  preceding  3  years.  The  EAs  have  developed  their \nmonitoring capabilities for the ongoing projects and have the capacity to monitor the Project. To \nfacilitate assessment of the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impact, an international consultant will be \nrecruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n\n9. \n\nCoordination Meetings \n\n50. \nRepresentatives  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  Tajikistan,  and  ADB  will  meet  once  a \nyear,  alternatively  in  Bishkek  and  Dushanbe,  to  discuss  the  project  implementation  status, \nresolve common problems, and, most importantly, ensure full implementation of the CBA. The \ngovernment  of  the  organizing  country  will  finance  the  costs  incurred  in  preparing  for  and \nattending  these  meetings  through  the  project  management  accounts  of  their  respective  loan \nand/or grant components.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nADB and the governments will carry out two midterm reviews of the Project: one in 2009 \nfor  the  road  and  border  infrastructure  components  and  another  in  2011  for  the  PBM  road \nmaintenance  components.  The  reviews  will  focus  on  project  outputs  and  milestone  activities, \nparticularly those relating to institutional, administrative, technical, environmental, resettlement, \nand social aspects. The Project\u2019s economic viability and other relevant aspects that may impact \non  project  performance  will  also  be  assessed.  The  reviews  will  examine  the  implementation \nprogress for the policy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in the financing and \ngrant agreements. \n \nH. \n\nStakeholders\u2019 Participation and Consultation \n\n52. \nDuring  the  project  preparation  activities\u2014including  ADB  missions,  feasibility  studies, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  social  surveys,  and  resettlement  planning\u2014consultations \nwere  carried  out  with  governments,  embassies  of  Afghanistan  and  the  PRC,  international \ndonors  and  aid  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  local  communities,  road  users,  and \nother  stakeholders  of  the  Project.  The  consultations  covered  major  issues  such  as  road \nalignment,  transport  services,  project  benefits,  and  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the \nProject.  The  results  showed  a  high  degree  of  public  support,  as  well  as  support  from  all \ngovernments concerned with the Project. Consultations with the stakeholders are summarized \nin Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n53. \nThe  Project  will  be  accompanied  by  regional  TA  to  help  prepare  the  CBA  among  the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. The CBA will facilitate smooth transborder movement of \npeople,  goods,  and  vehicles  and  remove  nonphysical  barriers  to  regional  trade  and  transport. \nThe outcome of the TA is a CBA signed by the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and \nTajikistan  prior  to  completion  of  physical  works  under  the  Project.  In  preparing  the  CBA,  the \nconsultants  will:  (i)  review  operations  of  the  border,  immigration,  customs,  and  quarantine \nfacilities;  (ii)  review  existing  customs  and  transport  documentation;  (iii)  identify  physical  and \nnonphysical  barriers,  both  inland  and  at  border  posts,  and  recommend  measures  for  their \nremoval;  (iv)  hold  consultations  with  involved  government  officials  to  establish  agreeable \ndocumentation  and  procedures  for  drivers,  vehicles,  and  goods;  and  (v)  facilitate  regularly \nmeetings  and  reaching  an  agreement  on  CBA  terms  and  conditions.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  over  24  months  and  finance  the  services  of  international  consultants  for  24 \nperson-months  and  national  consultants  for  10  person-months.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is \nestimated  at  $550,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram in the amount of $500,000. ADB will be the EA for the TA, and the Government of the \nKyrgyz Republic will provide in-kind contribution estimated at $50,000 by providing office space \nfor the consultants, administrative support and counterpart staff. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n54. \nBy improving the road corridor from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz-PRC border, the Project will \nsubstantially reduce the obstruction to trade and will facilitate regional trade. The entire region \nwill  benefit  from  the  Project,  while  the  immediate  project  area  will  benefit  through  economic \ngrowth  and  increased  access  to  markets  and  social  services.  Improving  the  road  will  boost \nagricultural  production,  contribute  to  mining  industry  development,  and  generate  employment \nopportunities. \n \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n55. \nTraffic  forecasts  for  the  Project  were  based  on  the  following  four  key  assumptions:  (i) \npolitical stability and strong macroeconomic performance in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan; \n(ii)  continued  commitment  of  the  governments  of  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan  to \nregional  cooperation;  (iii)  continued  external  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  Tajikistan;  and  (iv)  completion  of  interlinking  road  projects.  The  forecasts  were \nmade for the 2008\u20132031 period and based on expected growth in GDP, income elasticities of \ndemand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  patterns  (Appendix  9).  The  total  traffic  (domestic  and \ninternational)  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  8.3%  for  all  vehicle  types, \nreaching a distance-weighted average of 2,000 vehicles per day in 2025. Generated traffic was \nestimated at 20% of normal traffic, and it is expected to grow at the same rate as normal traffic. \nIn  addition,  there  are  anthracite  mines,  in  both,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  and \nexpected  construction  of  a  new  dam  and  hydropower  station  at  Rogun  in  Tajikistan  along  the \nCorridor.  It  was  assumed,  based  on  the  current  status  of  negotiations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nand Tajikistan governments with potential investors in the concessions, that these projects will \nsoon  start  and  generate  additional  traffic.  The  traffic  thus  generated  accounts  for  30%  of  total \ntraffic and was incorporated into the analysis.  \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nInternational  traffic  is  minimal  at  present,  but  it  is  expected  to  grow  rapidly  once  the \n56. \nCorridor  is  improved.  The  international  generated  traffic  forecast  was based  on  an  analysis  of \ntrade patterns in the region. Four freight traffic projections were examined based on the similar \nanalysis  under  the  Phase  II  road  project  in  Tajikistan:  (i)  Tajikistan-Kyrgyz  Republic  trade,  (ii) \nTajikistan-PRC  trade,  (iii)  Afghanistan-PRC  trade,  and  (iv)  vehicle  imports  from  the  PRC.  It  is \nprojected  that  it  will  grow  from  currently  less  than  10  to  over  1,000  vehicles  per  day  by  2031 \n(50% of the total traffic), of which more than 50% will be heavy commercial vehicles. About 30% \nof this projected international traffic will be destined to or originate from Tajikistan, 4% to or from \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  66%  to  or  from  Afghanistan.  Total  projected  international  traffic  will \nreach 760 vehicles per day by 2030. It is possible that other international traffic may be diverted \nfrom  rail  or  other  modes  of  transport.  Potential  benefits  related  to  the  latter  are  much  smaller \nand therefore disregarded in this analysis.   \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n57. \nThe economic analysis entailed projecting costs and benefits with- and without-project in \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines.27 The  difference  between  the  with-  and  without-project  cost \nand benefits streams represents the net benefits of the Project. The economic analysis covers \n23 years (2008\u20132031), comprising 3 years of construction and 20 years of operation. The least-\ncost option was selected amongst mutually exclusive project alternatives and various pavement \ntreatment options. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix 9. \n \nThe  major  benefits  of  the  Project  are  (i)  reduced  road  user  costs28 to  normal  traffic  and \n58. \nadditional  traffic  from  coal  mines  and  the  hydroelectric  project,  (ii)  increased  producer  and \nconsumer surplus accruing to generated domestic traffic, (iii) benefits from generated and diverted \ninternational  transit  traffic,  and  (iv)  increased  agricultural  production  and  incomes  in  Tajikistan. \nThe project costs include resource cost of road improvement and maintenance throughout the \nproject  life.  These  costs  were  estimated  in  financial  terms  and  factored  by  0.8529 to  convert \nthem to economic terms. Both costs and benefits are expressed in constant US dollars at mid-\n2007 price levels. \n \n59. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall Project is 18.1%, and the net \npresent  value  is  $37.6  million,  using  a  12%  discount  rate.  Considering  benefits  accruing \nseparately,  the  EIRR  is  17.9%  for  Tajikistan  and  14.5%  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Most  of  the \nbenefits  accrue  to  international  traffic  (54%),  followed  by  savings  in  road  user  costs  (27%), \ngreater  agricultural  production  (17%),  and  time  and  domestic  generated  traffic  benefits  (2%). \nSensitivity analysis tested the effects of negative changes in key parameters determining project \nbenefits  and  costs.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  the  Project  would  maintain  its \neconomic viability with an EIRR of 13.7% even under the most adverse scenario. A distribution \nanalysis  was  made  to  capture  project  benefits  by  country.  The  analysis  shows  that  Tajikistan \nwould receive 70% of net benefits, the Kyrgyz Republic 20.5%, the PRC 9.3%, and Afghanistan \n0.2%. Tajikistan\u2019s share of international benefits would be 42% and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s 38%. \nThe distribution of benefits is in Appendix 9. The Project is expected to help boost regional trade, \nparticularly  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan.  Their  bilateral  trade  is  expected  to \ngrow from 27,236 tons in 2006 to about 250,000 tons in 2015. Tajikistan-PRC trade is forecast \nto  rise  from  14,260  tons  in  2006  to  about  1  million  tons  in  2015,  and  PRC-Afghanistan  trade \nfrom 0 to about 500,000 tons in the same period. \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB. 1997.

Nevertheless,  it  will  have  a  poverty \nreduction impact and benefits. Social and poverty assessments were undertaken separately for \neach  country  under  PPTA.  A  consolidated  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  for \nthe two countries is in Appendix 10. The Project indirectly benefits the poor through increased \nmobility  and  accessibility  to  markets  and  social  services  in  the  project  area;  lower  transport \ncosts  for  inputs  and  products;  better  access  to  and  interaction  with  other  regions;  and \nemployment  opportunities  during  and  after  construction  owing  to  increased  coal  mining, \nurbanization,  and  other  economic  activities.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  indirectly  benefit  (i) \nabout 228,000 people from three communities in Tajikistan, among whom 100,800, or 44%, are \npoor; and (ii) about 29,000 people from two communities in the Kyrgyz Republic, of which 52% \nare  poor.  A  further  quarter  of  beneficiaries  are  considered  vulnerable.  Poverty  levels  in  the \nproject area are higher than respective national averages, which are 43% for both countries.30 \nThe  most  predominant  livelihood  sector,  whether  on  a  regular  or  irregular  basis,  is  agriculture \n(including  vegetables,  processing  of  farm  and  meat  products),  and  it  is  the  main  source  of \nincome  for  45%  of  households  in  Tajikistan  and  39%  of  households  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic. \nIndirectly,  the  project  will  promote  the  intensification  and  higher  profitability  of  agricultural \nproduction  and  lead  to  substantially  reduced  poverty.  There  is  potential  in  the  project  area  to \nimprove  yields  of  the  main  commercial  crops  of  potatoes,  apple,  and  pears  if  agricultural \nextension  services  are  simultaneously  improved  and  provided.  The  poor  could  benefit  more \nthan  others  from  agricultural  improvements,  because  their  growth  potential  is  higher  or  their \ncurrent  level  of  production  is  lower.  Poverty  reduction  in  the  long  run  will  depend  on \nimprovements in agriculture. About 15% of the beneficiaries in Tajikistan and 60% in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  own  some  form  of  transportation,  of  which  about  two  thirds  is  owned  by  the  poor, \nmostly in the forms of such nonmotorized transport as bicycles and animal-drawn carts. About \none  third  of  motorized  transport  owners  are  poor,  yet  there  is  a  highly  competitive  market  of \nowner-drivers. Therefore, vehicle operating cost savings are likely to be passed on to the poor \nin the form of reduced costs, fares, and charges. \n \n61. \nThe Project is expected to help poor and nonpoor alike, as it will contribute to regionally \nbalanced and equitable economic growth by (i) improving access to marketing and employment \nopportunities;  (ii)  facilitating  access  to  key  social  services;  (iii)  supporting  and  stimulating \nagricultural production; (iv) promoting trade, encouraging livelihood diversification, and enabling \ninformation  exchange;  (v)  improving  a  key  component  of  regional  and  rural  infrastructure  and \nreducing  widening  gaps  in  living  standards  and  economic  opportunities  between  the \nmountainous and flatland areas; and (vi) removing one of the development constraints on poor \nand rural communities. Overall, connectivity will increase transborder trade and transportation, \nas  well  as  tourism  development.  Farmers  will  easily  transport  their  fruits  and  vegetables  to \ninternal  markets  (primarily  Bishkek,  Naryn,  and  Osh)  and  externally  (Kazakhstan,  Russia,  and \nUzbekistan). In Tajikistan, a $2 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will link \ncommunities to the road and restore a flood-destroyed bridge that will complement the Project \nand enhance social and poverty impacts for the communities involved.  \n \n The  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  at  early  stages  of  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic. \n62. \nHIV/AIDS  has  been  identified,  however,  as  a  potential  risk.  Ongoing  Phase  II  of  the  ADB-\nfinanced Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) in Tajikistan and the \nSouthern  Transport  Corridor  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  (footnote  20) \n\n                                                 \n30 World  Bank.  2006.

This  includes  clinical  support  through \nproviding  HIV  testing  kits  and  treatment  packages  for  sexually  transmitted  infections.  Both \nprojects  deal  with  project  zones  and  thus  cover  current  project  areas.  Furthermore,  specific \nprovisions  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention  will  be  included  in  the  biddings  documents  for  civil  works \nwith built-in monitoring and awareness campaigns.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Safeguards  \n\n63. \nAll civil works in both countries will take place either within the existing rights-of-way or \non  unused  state-owned  land.  No  major  relocation  of  households  or  acquisition  of  productive \nland  is  expected.  If  the  Project  needs  new  borrow  pits  or  quarries,  these  are  expected  to  be \nlocated  on  unused  state-owned  land.  The  Project  will  affect  27  families  (228  persons)  in \nTajikistan  and  no  families  will  be  affected  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  27  plots  affected  are \nsmall parcels of land occupied by houses and by sheds that encroach upon the road corridor. In \nall, these land-use impacts amount to 1,843 square meters (m2). Seven houses are affected for \na  total  of  839  m2,  and  the  24  sheds  affected  total  1,004  m2.  All  houses  but  two  are  modestly \naffected and based on the choice of their owners will not be relocated. There are 62 poplars and \nwillow  trees  affected.  A  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with \nTajikistan\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The \nresettlement strategy, compensation standards, entitlements, and rehabilitation measures were \nbased  on  impact  surveys  and  consultations  with  local  authorities,  communities,  and  affected \nhouseholds.  Demolishment  of  structures  and  properties  on  the  right-of-way  will  be  completed \nwithin  2008,  and  compensation  of  $103,000  will  be  paid  from  the  Government\u2019s  counterpart \nfunds prior to commencing civil works. Appendix 11 summarizes the short resettlement plan. \n \n64. \nProject  areas  both  in  the  Kyrgyz  and  Tajik  sides  are  inhabited  by  Kyrgyz  and  Tajik \npeople.  In  both  countries,  the  two  ethnic  groups  live  in  harmony  and  participate  equally  in  the \nmarket  economy,  local  politics,  and  national  cultural  processes.  There  are  no  groups  with \ncharacteristics of indigenous people (as defined by ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People, 1998) \naffected by the Project. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n65. \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  classification  is  Category  B.  Two  initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  of  the  Project  and  a  consolidated  Summary  IEE  (SIEE)  were  carried  out \nunder  the  PPTA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003).  Based  on  results  of  the  IEEs,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to \ngenerate  significant  environmental  impacts  provided  the  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  the \nIEEs  are  implemented  appropriately.  The  consolidated  SIEE  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  as  detailed  in  the  IEEs  and  SIEE  includes  mitigation \nmeasures and a monitoring program for both construction and operation phases of the Project.   \n \nE. \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\n66. \nThe Project was designed with reasonable assumptions and keeping in mind the risks that \ncould  prevent  the  Project\u2019s  intended  outcome  and/or  impact  from  fully  materializing.  Key \nassumptions are (i) continued political stability, strong economic performance, and commitment for \nregional  cooperation  among  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan;  (ii)  continued  external \nassistance and governments\u2019 commitment to developing the road subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan; and (iii) timely provision of counterpart funding and support from local governments.   \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f \n67. \nThe main Project risks include: (i) forecasted international traffic does not materialize, and \n(ii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices for construction materials and labor. Given the \ncurrent  economic  development  perspectives  in  the  region  and  trends  in  the  region\u2019s  trade  and \ntransport  turnover,  it  is  anticipated  that  forecasted  traffic  levels  will,  indeed,  materialize.  It  is \nexpected  that  the  economies  of  the  regional  countries  will  grow  at  least  at  the  same  pace  as \ncurrently and, most likely, growth will strengthen even further. Reasonable price escalation factors \nwere incorporated into the cost estimates to minimize the risk of project cost overrun. Based on \nthe  current  trend  in  world  prices  for  major  construction  inputs,  escalation  of  the  project  costs \nbeyond  the  incorporated  reasonable  assumptions  is  unlikely.  Based  on  these  assumptions  and \nthe likelihood of risks, it is expected that the Project\u2019s benefits and impacts will outweigh its costs. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Governments  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \n68. \nTajikistan  (the  Governments),  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in \nthe respective legal documents: \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCounterpart  Funding.

The  combined  length  of  the  road \nnetwork is about 31,800 kilometers (km), consisting of 4,870 km of national roads (republican and \ninternational)  and  27,000  km  of  local  roads.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications \n(MOTC) has jurisdiction over all of the national roads and 8,920 km of local roads. The major part \nof the network was constructed before 1970 and was not built to support increased vehicle axle \nloads  and  weight  standards.  Inadequate  maintenance,  damage  from  civil  conflict,  and  frequent \nnatural disasters have left the network in a state of severe deterioration. It is estimated that 80% of \nthe  national  road  network  is  in  poor  or  very  poor  condition.1 While  the  extent  of  the  network  is \nconsidered  adequate  to  accommodate  existing  traffic  levels,  the  condition  of  the  network  limits \naccess  and  mobility,  thus  restricting  road  transport\u2019s  contribution  to  economic  growth,  poverty \nreduction, and social development. The poor condition of many roads has lowered travel speeds, \nincreased fuel consumption, and raised vehicle operating costs. \n \n2. \nRoad transport carried 26 million tons of freight (70% of total) in 2006, which is 10% of \nthe 1991 volume but twice the 2000 volume. In terms of turnover, road transport has gradually \ntaken over from railways. In 2006, it carried 1,776 million ton-km as compared to 1,214 million \nton-km  carried  by  railways,  whereas  in  2000  roads  carried  422  million  ton-km  and  railways \n1,326  million  ton-km.  Passenger  transportation  has  traditionally  been  dominated  by  road \ntransport, and it returned to 1991 levels in 2006 with about 370 million passengers transported. \n \nB. \n \nPrior to ADB\u2019s involvement with Tajikistan\u2019s transport sector, the Transport Department \n3. \nunder  the  Office  of  the  President  acted  as  the  central  point  of  coordination  for  the  transport \nsector. Development planning for the subsectors was the responsibility of separate government \norganizations.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Roads  served  as  the  national  agency  for  road \ninfrastructure management. It managed road transport enterprises, allocated budgets, assigned \nwork, and managed personnel. The Tajik Railway Company served as the agency for railways, \nwhile the Tajikistan State Air Company served as the agency for civil aviation and airports. Each \norganization was responsible for preparing development plans and investment programs for its \nown  subsector.  During  implementation  of  the  development  plans,  the  Office  of  the  President \nprovided  coordination  for  review  and  revision  of  the  investment  programs  and  for  allocating \ninvestment funds among the subsectors. \n \nAs a result of policy dialogue with and technical assistance from ADB, the administration \n4. \nof  the  transport  sector  was  reorganized  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  was  created  in \n2001. It was responsible for all transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, and airports. It \nassumed  responsibility  for  telecommunications  in  November  2006  and  became  the  Ministry  of \nTransport  and  Communications  (MOTC).  MOTC  is  now  in  charge  of  sector  policy,  regulation, \nplanning,  operations,  and  investment.  It  is  guided  by  the  Office  of  the  President,  Ministry  of \nFinance,  and  State  Committee  on  Investments  and  State  Property  Management,  which  are \ninvolved  in  developing  the  Government\u2019s  overall  reform  program  and  prioritizing  capital \nexpenditures. The MOTC is divided into eight departments and is headed by the minister, who \n\nRoad Administration \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Several  studies  have  indicated  that  the  design  standards  of  FSU  state  roads \nimplemented in Tajikistan\u2019s national roads are sometimes higher than those of the United States \nor European countries. However, they do not always result in optimum road design. For lower-\nstandard roads, FSU standards for design speed and cross sections are similar to those used in \ndeveloping countries, but for higher-category roads, they are excessive. The construction quality \nof  Tajikistan\u2019s  roads  is  generally  inadequate,  mainly  because  of  a  lack  of  cost-effective \nconstruction techniques and independent construction supervision.  \n \n6. \nThe  Transport  Safety  and  Security  Unit  of  MOTC\u2019s  Transport  Policy  Department  is \nresponsible  for  the  physical  aspects  of  road  safety,  including  road  conditions  and  signs. \nTajikistan\u2019s road safety record in the mid-1990s was poor, with a fatality rate of 407 per 10,000 \nvehicles.2\n Road  safety  has  improved  since  then  because  of  MOTC\u2019s  Accident  Prevention  Plan, \nwhich  monitors  about  30  indicators  annually.  Although  the  number  of  vehicles  has  increased \nsubstantially,  the  rates  of  road  accidents  and  fatalities  have  remained  relatively  stable.  In  2005, \nthere  were  a  total  1,724  registered  road  accidents  (a  decrease  of  5%  from  2000)  with  resulting \nfatalities of 483 (3.5% increase from 2000) and an additional 2,036 people injured. In the project \narea, the number of accidents decreased from 22 involving 28 fatalities in 2003 to 13 accidents \nand 14 fatalities in 2005, then to 10 accidents and seven fatalities in 2006. \n \n7. \nOverloaded  vehicles  cause  roads  to  deteriorate  prematurely.  Tajikistan  is  a  party  to  the \nIntergovernmental  Agreement  on  Vehicle  Dimension  and  Weights  which  has  been  signed  by  10 \nCommonwealth of Independent States countries. Two national decrees have been issued to make it \neffective3\n but are not enforced because vehicle-weighing equipment is lacking. The agreement and \nthe decrees require that overloaded vehicles obtain a special permit to enter Tajikistan and the other \ncountries,  which  are  allowed  to  charge  for  it.  In  practice,  while  Tajikistan  issues  permits  jointly \nthrough  MOTC,  the  Ministry  of  State  Revenue,  and  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  there  is  no \nschedule  of  payments  and,  therefore,  no  payments  are  being  collected.  The  Government  has \nissued another decree4 setting the levels of fees for overloading, and axle-weighing equipment will \nbe procured and installed under the ongoing ADB-financed Loan 2196-TAJ.   \n \nD. \n\nRoad Transport Industry  \n\n \n\n8. \nMajor  changes  have  occurred  in  the  road  transport  industry  since  independence, \nespecially  in  the  commercialization  and,  in  some  cases,  privatization  of  the  industry.  In  1998, \nthe  Government  had  jurisdiction  over  81  road  transport  service  enterprises.  Most  intercity  bus \nand  trucking  operations  are  now  organized  as  joint-stock  companies,  with  various  shares  of \npublic and private ownership. For example, of the 52 medium and large transport organizations \nthat  were  formerly  part  of  MOT  and  designated  by  the  Government  for  privatization,  73%  are \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n3  Decree  93  of  11  March  2000  on  adoption  of  the  agreement  on  vehicle  dimensions  and  weights  for  international \nroad  transportation  among  CIS  countries;  and  Decree  82  of  4  March  2005  on  adoption  of  the  agreement  to \nintroduce international certificate for weighing cargo vehicles in the territories of CIS countries. \n\n4  Decree 779 of 29 December 2006 on regulations for vehicles with sizes and axle loads exceeding norms to use \n\nautomobile roads.  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nwholly owned by the Government, 6% are wholly privately owned, and 21% have mixed public-\nprivate  ownership.  As  of  March  2002,  5,226  vehicles  were  operated  by  joint-stock  companies \nand  other  organizations  within  MOT.  Of  these,  3,627  vehicles,  or  69%,  were  operated  by  four \njoint-stock  companies  (Badakshonnakliyot,  Khatlontrans,  Khudjandnaklyot,  and  Kulyabtrans). \nThe remaining vehicles were operated by other MOT departments, Tajik Air, and Tajik Rail. A \nsignificant  portion  of  trucking  and  most  long-distance  bus  services  are  operated  by  private \ncompanies.  Tariffs  for  road  freight  have  been  completely  deregulated,  and  road  haulage \norganizations  enter  into  agreements  with  customers  at  negotiated  rates.  Tariffs  for  passenger \ntransport  are  still  regulated.  MOTC  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  jointly  establish  passenger \ntransport  tariffs  for  buses,  minibuses,  and  taxis  for  urban  and  long-distance  services.  While \nthese official tariffs should be charged by all operators, many bus and minibus operators charge \nmarket fares, according to what they think people will pay. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear, depending on the Government\u2019s priorities and fiscal constraints. Since the Road Fund was \nabolished  in  2000  on  the  recommendation  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  funds  for  the \nroad  sector  are  allocated  through  the  Government\u2019s  normal  central  budgetary  process.  As  a \nresult of general fiscal constraints and allocations to new road construction projects, approved \nbudgets for road maintenance and rehabilitation for the past four years have been only 20% of \nthe amount requested. MOTC gets supplementary budget during the course of the year for any \nemergency  responses  and  additional  unforeseen  expenditures.  Total  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation expenditures in 2004 were TJS14.2 million and nearly tripled in 2007 to constitute \nmore  than  95%  of  total  expenditures  in  the  road  subsector.  Despite  this  progress,  the  road \nsubsector  remains  greatly  underfinanced.  Only  about  $300  per  km  is  spent  annually  on \nmaintenance, which is very low by any meaningful standards. This spending should be at least \nfour times the current level.

MOTC is responsible for planning and coordinating the maintenance of Tajikistan's road \nnetwork.  MOTC  maintains  roads  and  bridges  through  five  regional  road  departments: \nBadakhshan, Dushanbe, Khatlon and Kulyab (combined in 2005), Khudjand, and Rasht. These \nroad  maintenance  departments  are  responsible  for  approximately  13,800  km  of  road  and \nemploy 2,981 people. The departments are state entities attached to MOTC and are composed \nof road maintenance units. None of the departments or maintenance units have been privatized. \nWhile  it  is  the  stated  intention  of  MOTC  to  eventually  privatize  these,  no  progress  has  been \nmade to date. The road maintenance departments prepare annual plans and budgets based on \nsystems established during the Soviet era. This information is then presented to MOTC, which \nin turn allocates funding to the various departments. Each road maintenance unit is responsible \nfor that part of the road network within its jurisdiction, with the actual maintenance being carried \nout  by  staff  who  are  responsible  for  specific  sections  of  the  road.  The  plant,  equipment,  and \nmaterials  available  to  the  workforce,  however,  are  generally  not  sufficient  for  carrying  out \neffective  maintenance  activities.  The  Rasht  Road  Department  and  the  Dushanbe  Road \nDepartment  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  roads  in  the  Regions  of  Republican \nSubordination. The Rasht Road Department, which is responsible for maintenance of the road \nto be improved under the Project, is responsible for maintaining 885 km of roads, is composed \nof nine road maintenance units, and employs 237 people. The Dushanbe Road Department is \nresponsible for maintaining the road sections being rehabilitated under the first phase. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nROAD SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS  \nKYRGYZ REPUBLIC \n\nSubsector Description \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  mountainous,  landlocked  country.  Road  transport  dominates \nthe  country\u2019s  transport  system,  accounting  for  about  94%  of  freight  tonnage  movements  and \nalmost all passenger traffic (excluding intra-urban). As with most other former Soviet republics, \nthe  economic  crisis  stemming  from  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  resulted  in  a  decline  in \neconomic  activity  and  disrupted  customary  trading  patterns.  Demand  for  transport  has  fallen \ndramatically  since  independence.  In  2001,  freight  turnover  (measured  in  ton-kilometers)  was \nonly 20% of its 1990 level, and passenger turnover was  57% of its previous level. The lowest \nlevels were reached in 1995 when the freight volumes in ton-km and passenger movement were \nonly 14% and 33% of their respective 1990 levels, reflecting sharp decline in real incomes and \noutput. Demand grew in 1996 and 1997, but freight declined again following the 1998 financial \ncrisis. Passenger transport has been growing at about 6% annually since 1997. \n \n2. \nThe  road  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  covers  all  seven  provinces  (oblasts),  and \nprovides connections to remote communities and links to neighboring countries. About 18,900 \nkm  of  roads  are  under  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC), \nincluding  9,900  km  of  state  roads  and  9,000  km  of  local  roads.  About  40%  of  the  roads  are \nsealed,  including  some  with  gravel  mixed  with  bitumen  binder.  Over  50%  are  gravel  and  less \nthan 10% are earth roads. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacity and \nare underutilized, the existing basic transport infrastructure is adequate for the level of economic \nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion \nor  major  upgrading  of  the  transport  system  but  proper  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  to \npreserve  the  existing  network.  Roads  at  all  levels  are  deteriorating;  over  60%  now  require \nextensive  maintenance  or  rehabilitation.  About  15,000  km  of  road  are  outside  MOTC\u2019s \njurisdiction,  mainly  rural  and  farm  roads.  Most  were  formerly  the  responsibility  of  state  and \ncollective farms. Following the breakup of the state and collective farm system, the responsibility \nfor maintaining rural and farm roads is now with the district administrations. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for planning and administering \nroad policies, programs, and projects to the MOTC, which is responsible for policy making and \nregulating, planning, and developing transport and communications, including the road, railway, \nand aviation sectors. The Department of Roads, under MOTC, is responsible for managing the \nroad sector. MOTC\u2019s seven regional road maintenance agencies, one in each province, plus the \nBishkek\u2013Osh  road  Division  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the  state  and  local  roads  under \nMOTC\u2019s  jurisdiction.  The  regional  road  maintenance  agencies  and  Bishkek\u2013Osh road  Division \ncomprise 58 local maintenance units that carry out actual maintenance works. Other important \nagencies  in  the  road  sector  are  (i)  KyrgyzIntrans,  a  holding  agency  for  six  freight  transport \ncompanies  and  forwarding  agencies  engaged  mainly  in  international  trade;  and  (ii)  technical \nagencies  in  various  stages  of  divestment  from  MOTC\u2019s  control,  including  the  Road  Design \nInstitute (Kyrgyzdortransproekt) and a small agency responsible for developing and testing new \nroad construction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika). \n \n \n \n \n\nRoad Administration \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       33   \n\n \n\nRoad Standards and Safety \n\nC. \n \n4. \nThe total number of road accidents in the Kyrgyz Republic increased from 1,135 in 1999 \nto  1,555  in  2003.  The  primary  cause  of  accidents  is  excessive  driving  speed  on  roads  in \nmountainous terrain. Many roads outside of the cities pass though mountainous terrain and/or \nalongside  rivers,  with  the  road  alignment  varying  significantly  along  the  same  road  and \nsometimes  changing  suddenly.  The  mountainous  terrain  also  results  in  significant  rockfall \nhazards  on  many  roads.  During  the  winter  season,  ice  and  snow-covered  roads  constitute  a \nmajor  safety  hazard.  The  absence  of  rest  areas  and  roadside  service  facilities  over  long \ndistances may also contribute to accidents. \n \n5. \nADB  has  been  involved  in  improving  road  safety  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  through  the \nSecond  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  and  Almaty-Bishkek  Regional  Road  Rehabilitation  Project \n(Loan  1775-KGZ).  The  former  prepared  a  time-bound  road  safety  program  to  reduce  the \naccident rate. Under the latter, the Government established the Road Safety Committee and the \ncommittee\u2019s  secretariat  in  2004  to  coordinate  road  safety  activities  and  involve  the  various \nstakeholders. The secretariat has begun its work, including to prepare a road accident database \nand  other  safety  information.  The  Government  also  agreed  to  update  the  Road  Safety  Act  for \nsubmission  to  Parliament.  The  Act  will  include  legislation  concerning  safe  driving,  safety  audit \nfor  road  designs,  safety  education,  road  safety  publicity,  vehicle  safety  standards,  road  safety \nresearch,  and  emergency  assistance  to  accident  victims.  Advisory  technical  assistance  (TA) \nattached  to  Loan  1775-KGZ  has  helped  the  Government  establish  the  National  Road  Safety \nCouncil,  update  the  Road  Safety  Act,  prepare  a  Russian  version  of  Road  Safety  Guidelines \nprepared under earlier TA, and conduct road safety seminars to implement the guidelines. \n \nD. \n\nRoad Transport Industry  \n\n6. \nTransport  companies  were  controlled  by  a  joint-stock  holding  company,  Kyrgyz  Auto \nTransport, until 1994, when Decree No. 61 abolished the company and transferred its functions \nto  MOTC.  Of  the  total  251  transport  enterprises  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  126  have  been \nprivatized,  primarily  through  conversion  to  joint-stock  companies.  Currently  86  companies \nprovide  road  transport  services;  74  have  been  privatized.  The  companies  that  have  not  been \nprivatized comprise urban bus enterprises in major cities and some enterprises connected with \nstate  security.  The  transport  companies  employ  about  25,000.  Most  of  the  freight  and \npassenger transport companies operate at the provincial and district (rayon) levels, with a small \nnumber of national operators. As a result of measures that the Government introduced in 1994 \nto  increase  competition,  most  of  the  national  and  provincial  holding  companies  and \nassociations,  which  had  continued  to  control  the  operations  of  individual  transport  companies, \nwere abolished. \n \nThe  Government  continues  to  have  a  strong  influence  in  the  market  for  intercity \n7. \npassenger  transport.  Kyrgyz  Transport  Inspection,  created  in  MOTC  in  1994,  issues  transport \nlicenses  and  regulates  transport  services.  The  market  for  freight  transport  services  is  more \ncompetitive than that for passenger transport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate \nconditions  of  price  and  arrange  intermodal  transport  services,  thus  facilitating  door-to-door \ntransport  arrangements,  and  to  offer  services  directly  themselves.  However,  the  Government \nalso  plays  a  large  role  in  freight  transport  through  regulation.  MOTC  is  responsible  for \nmonitoring  and  regulation,  including  licensing,  inspection,  and  safety  audits.  Increased \ncompetition in the market for transport services is necessary to improve transport services and \nensure that the reduction in transport costs is passed on to transport users.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \n Item  \n  MOTC (roads) \n\nGeneral Directorate \nBishkek Osh \n\n \nA.

External Financing of \nInvestment Projects \n \nGrand Total (A + B + C) \nMOTC = Ministry of Transport and Communication. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications \n \nIn  2003,  the  total  budget  allocation  to  MOTC  for  road  maintenance  was  Som255.9 \n9. \nmillion, or $5.85 million. This figure was slightly increased in 2004, due to emergency costs, and \nreached Som278.6 million. In addition, the funds allocated to road maintenance constitute less \nthan 30% (27.4% in 2003) of the total allocation to the road sector when external financing for \ncapital  investment  projects  is  taken  into  account.  If  only  budget  allocation  is  considered, \nhowever, the road maintenance allocation to MOTC represents 60\u201365% of the total. \n \n10. \nYearly  allocation  for  road  maintenance  is  usually  made  up  of  two  parts:  the  original \nallocation and supplementary allocation. The original allocation in 2003 was Som188.45 million. \nUsually  in  midyear,  following  requests  for  emergency  repairs  (mostly  due  to  landslides),  a \nsupplementary  budget  is  allocated.  In  2003,  an  additional  amount  of  Som67.47  million  was \nallocated to MOTC (Som41.4 million for Bishkek\u2013Osh road and Som25 million for the rest of the \nnetwork).  Over  the  years  the  supplementary  budget  has  varied  while  the  original  budget  has \nremained relatively consistent. \n \n11. \nThe average annual road maintenance expenditure for the MOTC network is $375/km, \nwith  funds  highly  skewed  toward  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road.  This  amount  is  far  lower  than  the \nusually  quoted  figure  of  $2,000  per  km  to  adequately  maintain  a  stabilized  road  network. \nMoreover, only 20% of the maintenance work is routine maintenance, that average being at a \nvery low $60 per km for the network. It is said that in some cases roads have deteriorated so \nmuch  that  the  size  of  the  potholes  no  longer  permits  ordinary  routine  maintenance  and  major \nrepair maintenance is needed. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       35   \n\n \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \nF. \n \n12. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic, in its draft road sector strategy paper, reported an alarming loss of \nabout 1,000 km of asphalt-surfaced roads over the last 5 years and identified that it needs over $1 \nbillion  to  rehabilitate  its  2,242  km  long  major  road  corridors  and  annual  maintenance  funding  of \n$48  million  over  the  next  5  years  to  bring  the  devastated  road  network  into  more  stable  and \nmaintainable condition. The National Poverty Strategy for 2006 identified the poor condition of the \nroads as a  major constraint to the country\u2019s economic and social development. It quotes recent \ndetailed  studies  of  the  country\u2019s  principal  roads  that  found  that  two  thirds  of  their  length  was  in \ndistressed condition. Past neglect of road network maintenance means that little can now be done \nto  prevent  the  loss  of  a  large  part  of  the  present  asphalt  surfacing.  Without  rapid  and  carefully \nfocused  interventions,  this  and  even  more  serious  degradation  is  inevitable.  Road  user  costs \n(manifest in higher consumption of fuel, spare parts, vehicle depreciation, time loss, and accident \ncosts)  will  increase  many  times  more  than  the  cost  of  the  road  maintenance  that  has  been \nneglected.  Furthermore,  unchecked  deterioration  of  the  road  network  will  have  serious  impacts \nbeyond those that can be measured within the transport sector itself. Kyrgyz centers of industry \nand  commerce  will  be  isolated  and  lose  competitiveness  versus  regional  trading  partners. \nDispersed population groups within the Republic\u2019s borders will become further disconnected from \nurban  markets,  social  services,  and  opportunities  to  study  and  work  abroad.  The  country\u2019s \nimmense tourism potential will remain largely unexploited. These and other lost opportunities will \nthwart national programs for poverty alleviation. The National Poverty Strategy concludes that to \nfully achieve its policy objectives of assuring connectivity and access along the network corridors, \nthe MOTC will need to focus its available resources on preservation, through maintenance, of the \ncore network until the condition is stabilized. \n \n13. \nAlmost all routine and periodic maintenance is undertaken by MOTC depots (DEP). The \nDEPs have limited autonomy in deciding how to allocate the resources that are actually made \navailable to them from the MOTC. Salaries are paid directly by the MOTC. DEPs complain that \nthey have insufficient money to undertake maintenance work, and thus their staff and equipment \nare underutilized. The Government has accepted recommendations of previous TA that call for \nincreased private sector involvement in road maintenance, but, because little work is currently \ncontracted,  no  viable  contracting  industry  exists.  When  contracts  are  let,  payment  is  often \ndelayed.  A  step-by-step  approach  to  privatization  has  been  proposed.  The  Government \nproposes that the DEPs be commercialized as a first step. Based on experience in Kazakhstan, \nMOTC  believes  that  immediate  commercialization  may  result  in  loss  of  road  maintenance \nservice  providers  and  the  sale  of  existing  equipment.  Such  experience  led  Kazakhstan  to \nreintroduce a DEP system. Thus, although privatization and commercialization are accepted in \nprinciple, there has been little or no attempt to implement such a policy. \n \nIn  2004,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  an  action  plan  for  developing  and \n14. \nimplementing  a  strategy  to  ensure  adequate  road  maintenance.  A  new  methodology  for  road \nmaintenance is currently being developed under TA 4705-KGZ, TA 4444-KGZ, and the current \nproject. \n  \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n(REGIONAL PROJECTS IN TAJIKISTAN AND THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC) \nLoan/TA Amount \n($ million) \n\nProject Name \n\nLoan/TA/ Project \nNumber \n\nDate \nApproved \n\nA.

The \nProject  will  improve  121  kilometer  (km)  of  national  corridor  in  Tajikistan  and  142  km  of  main \nroad in the Kyrgyz Republic. The project road is divided into seven sections. Four sections fall \nunder the Tajikistan components. These are Section A: Nimchi\u2013Sayron (km 217\u2013248), Section \nB: Sayron\u2013Jirgatal (km 248\u2013273), Section C: Jirgatal\u2013Dumbrachi (km 273\u2013298), and Section D: \nDumbrachi\u2013Karamik (km 298\u2013337). Kyrgyz components include three sections covering Section \nE: Sary Tash\u2013Sari Mogol (km 0\u201330), Section F: Sari Mogol\u2013Doroot Korgon (km 30\u201397), and (iii) \nSection G: Doroot Korgon\u2013Tajik Border (km 97\u2013142). \n \n2. \nThe  economic  analysis  examined  the  expected  contribution  of  the  project  road  to  the \ncountry and region based on a with- and without-project comparison in accordance with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) guidelines.2 The analysis covers the period 2008\u20132031, comprising 3 \nyears  of  construction  and  20  years  of  operation,  expressed  in  constant  beginning-2007  US \ndollar prices. \n \nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\nRoad Condition.

Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \nExisting Traffic. Seasonally adjusted base year traffic counts3 were conducted for each \n4. \nsection of the project road and used in the traffic forecast analysis and economic assessments. \nExisting  data  on  historical  traffic  counts  by  the  respective  ministries  of  transport  and \ncommunications were reviewed to determine appropriate base year traffic. The existing traffic is \nrelatively  low  in  Tajikistan  with  the  traffic  count  ranging  from  395  vehicles  per  day  on  the \nsouthwestern-most  link  (Nimich\u2013Sayron)  to  150  vehicles  daily  on  the  northeastern-most  link \n(Dumbrachi\u2013Karamik),  and  the  distance-weighted  average  traffic  volume  is  estimated  at  247 \nvehicle  per  day.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  recent  traffic  counts  on  the  project  road  shows  that  it \naverages  around  100  vehicles  daily  between  Sary  Tash  and  Daroot  Korgon  and  about  50 \nvehicle between Daroot Korgon and the Tajik border and that this traffic is predominantly local.  \n \nTraffic Forecast. The traffic forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic \n5. \nproduct  (GDP),  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  patterns. \nAdditional  assumptions  include  (i)  political  stability  and  strong  macroeconomic  performance  in \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan;  (ii)  continued  commitment  of  Kyrgyz  Republic,  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  and  Tajikistan  governments  to  regional  cooperation;  and  (iii) \nsustainable  external  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  and  completion  of  interlinking  road \nprojects.  Expected  construction  of  coal  mines  in  both  countries  and  of  the  Rogun  dam  and \nhydropower station in Tajikistan along the Corridor were assumed to generate additional traffic. \n \n6. \nTotal traffic is expected to grow at an average 8.3% rate for all vehicle types. Generated \ntraffic  has  been  estimated  at  20%  of  normal  traffic  and  with  the  same  growth  rate  as  normal \ntraffic. In the analysis, generated traffic accounts for 30% of total and transit traffic.  \n \n7. \nInternational  traffic  is  minimal  at  present  but  it  is  expected  to  grow  once  the  entire \nCorridor is improved. The international generated traffic forecast is based on analysis of trade \npatterns in the region. Four freight traffic projections were examined based on a similar analysis \nunder the Phase II road project in Tajikistan: (i) Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic trade, (ii) Tajikistan-\nPRC  trade,  (iii)  Afghanistan-PRC  trade,  and  (iv)  vehicle  imports  from  the  PRC.  This  traffic  is \nprojected to grow from the current less than 10 to over 1,000 vehicles per day by the end of the \nanalysis  period  (to  50%  of  the  total  traffic).  More  than  half  of  that  will  be  heavy  commercial \nvehicles.  About  34%  of  this  projected  international  traffic  will  be  destined  to  or  originate  from \nTajikistan, 4% to or from the Kyrgyz Republic, and 66% to or from Afghanistan. Improving the \nregional road network, for which the project road sections presently constitute major bottlenecks, \nwill  provide  a  much  more  direct  and  efficient  transport  route  for  trade  between  these  country \npairs and will greatly facilitate trade. The traffic forecast is summarized in Table A9.5. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nConstruction Costs. The economic costs were estimated based on the financial cost of \n8. \nthe  capital  expenditures,  including  physical  contingencies.  Price  contingencies,  interest  during \nconstruction, and taxes and duties were excluded. Using a world price numeraire, nontradable \ncosts were converted from financial to economic costs by applying a standard conversion factor \nof 0.85 for both countries. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Project  preparation  technical  assistance  consultants  financed  by  ADB  conducted  traffic  counts  in  both  countries \n(November 2006), and consultants financed by European Commission conducted traffic counts (June 2007) on the \nproject road in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\nRoad  Maintenance  Costs.  It  was  assumed  that  the  existing  gravel  and/or  earth \n9. \nsurfaces  would  require  annual  routine  maintenance  and  re-graveling  at  regular  intervals.  The \npaved road sections in the \u201cwith\u201d project would require resealing with a single bituminous layer \nevery  5\u20137  years.  The  economic  maintenance  costs  were  based  on  unit  rates  derived  from \nongoing  operations  and  estimated  quantities.  Financial  analysis  further  examined  the  project \nimpact  on  the  financial  status  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  and  the \nGovernment, particularly the financial impact of the maintenance and operational costs from the \nProject.  Road  agency  costs  are  represented  by  recurrent  maintenance  costs  of  $0.2  million \nannually  for  each  the  Tajikistan  and  Kyrgyz  Republic  components  and  the  cost  of  periodic \nmaintenance at $52,000 per km in 2017 and 2024.  \n \n\n Item \nDescription \n\nTable A9.2: Maintenance Costs \nSecond \nIntervention \nSprayed seal \n\nThird  \nIntervention \n\nSubsequent \nInterventions \nAsphaltic concrete  Sprayed seal \n\n2024 \n16.1 \n\nYear or interval \nCost, $\u2019000/km  \nSources: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \nRoad  User  Costs.

The distribution of the Project\u2019s benefits among countries in the \nregion  was  examined.  The  benefits  are  distributed  primarily  among  four  countries,  as  follows: \nTajikistan5 (70%),  PRC  (9.3%),  Kyrgyz  Republic  (20.5%),  and  Afghanistan  (0.2%).  Tajikistan\u2019s \nshare of international benefits would be 42% and Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s 38%. \n \n13. \nThe  project  benefits  accruing  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  distributed \namong  six  groups:  (i)  users  of  freight  transport,  (ii)  users  of  passenger  transport,  (iii)  vehicle \nowners,  (iv)  skilled  and  unskilled  labor,  (v)  agricultural  households,6 and  (vi)  the  Government \nand/or economy. The distribution of benefits is illustrated in Table A9.8. \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses \n\n14. \nThe  Project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) of 18.1% at a 12% discount rate. EIRR without international traffic is estimated at 8.0%. \nMost of the benefits accrue to international traffic (54%), followed by savings in road user costs \n(27%), benefits to agricultural production in Tajikistan (17%), and generated traffic benefits (2%).  \n \n15. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  assesses  the  variables  to  which  the  Project\u2019s  estimated  EIRR \nand net present value are sensitive. The EIRR\u2019s sensitivity to the effects of possible unfavorable \nscenarios  related  to  changes  in  key  parameters  indicated  that  the  combined  Project  would \nmaintain its economic viability, with an EIRR of 12.0%, even under the adverse scenario.

ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies. Both ADB and the governments recognize the \nimportance of regional cooperation to the landlocked Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, with trade, transport, and energy \nbeing  the  priority  areas  for  socioeconomic  development.  The  strategies  support  the  governments\u2019  approach  to \nreducing  poverty  and  reaching  their  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  balancing  social  goals  with  the  need  to \nstimulate growth through improving market access to rapidly growing neighboring markets and investing in agriculture \nto create economic opportunities in rural areas where most of the poor reside. The Project directly supports one of the \ngoals in the country partnership strategies, which is to improve trade and road linkages with regional markets. \n  \nAlthough the Project does not directly target poverty reduction, it has indirect benefits for the poor through increased \nmobility  and  accessibility  to  markets  and  social  services  in  the  project  area;  lower  transport  costs  for  inputs  and \nproducts;  better  access  to  and  interaction  with  other  regions;  and  employment  opportunities  during  and  after \nconstruction  owing  to  increased  coal  mining,  urbanization,  and  other  economic  activities.  Overall,  connectivity  will \nboost local employment and income, as it increases transborder trade and transportation as well as tourism. Farmers \nwill  obtain  access  to  transportation  for  their  fruits  and  vegetables  to  markets  internally  (primarily  to  Dushanbe  and \nOsh) and externally (Kazakhstan and Russia). \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  Project  is  not  a  targeted  poverty  intervention.  Its  goal  is  to  foster  regional  cooperation  through  providing \nimprovements to sections of the regional road corridor and thereby supporting economic activities and addressing key \nissues  related  to  poverty  in  rural  areas.  The  Project  will  indirectly  benefit  (i)  about  228,000  people  from  three \ncommunities  in  Tajikistan,  among  whom  some  100,800,  or  44%,  are  poor;  and  (ii)  29,143  people  from  two \ncommunities  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  of  whom  52%  are  poor.  A  further  quarter  of  beneficiaries  are  considered  just \nabove the poverty line. Poverty levels in the project area are higher than respective national averages, which are at \n43% for both countries. The overall poverty level in the project area will be monitored through socioeconomic surveys \nduring the project implementation and after completion and reported in the Project\u2019s progress and completion reports.   \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nDuring  preparation  of  Stakeholders  Participation  Analysis,  representatives  of  the  ministries  of  transport  and \ncommunications  and  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  teams  undertook  socioeconomic  surveys  and  public \nmeetings  at  village,  jomoat  (village  cluster),  and/or  rayon  (district)  levels.  These  surveys  and  meetings  raised \nawareness  and  gained  local  support.  There  were  extensive  consultations  with  the  local  community  at  Tajikabad  in \nselecting the final road alignment on Tajikistan\u2019s portion of the Corridor, and due consideration was given to technical, \nenvironmental, social, resettlement, and economic impacts of the selected road alignment. Consultations will continue \nthroughout the project implementation to address implementation-related concerns and issues.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nOngoing ADB-financed projects in both the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan employ about 300 local unskilled labor and \n100 skilled labor. For maximizing the Project\u2019s benefits to the local communities, the contractors will be encouraged to \nuse local laborers, including women, to the maximum extent. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nOverall, female household heads account for about 10% of beneficiary households in the project area. The distribution \nof  male-  and  female-headed  households  across  the  income  groups  is  very  similar,  and  there  are  no  significant \ndifferences  that  merit  project-specific  gender  actions  based  on  poverty  rates.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nconcluded  that  women  will  be  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  and  that  the  Project  has  the  potential  to  create  gender \nspecific  outcomes  as  a  result  of  more  general  social  benefits  that  could  derive  from  improved  and  maintained  road \naccess  and  enhancing  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  productive  sector.  While  women  stand  to  benefit  from  these \nsubprojects,  they  also  are  likely  to  experience  potential  adverse  social  impacts,  including  increased  exposure  to \ncommunicable diseases. This risk will be mitigated through the HIV/AIDS/STDs and human trafficking awareness and \nprevention campaign to be implemented by the Project. Gender specific parameters have been included in the social \nimpact monitoring plan to ensure that women fully participate in and enjoy project benefits. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

Fences and uninhabited structures on \nthe  right-of-way  will  be  demolished  but  will  have  no \nadverse effects on income. Although the foreseen impact \nis  minimal,  a  short  resettlement  plan  is  prepared  and  will \nbe  further  updated  once  detailed  design  is  in  place. \nConsultations  were carried  out during project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance,  and  further  consultations  will  be \nconducted between the local government land committee \nand the affected households. \nThe  road  improvement  should  lead  to  reduced  transport \ncosts  for  the  poor  and  nonpoor  alike  through  savings  in \nvehicle operating costs, passed on to the poor in the form \nof lower freight rates. The Project does not envisage tolls \nor  any  contributions  from  the  beneficiaries  for  use  of  the \nimproved road corridor, except the transit fees charged to \ninternational road users.  \nSurplus  (underemployed)  labor  is  commonly  available  in \nthe  project  area.  The  Project  will  hire  unskilled  labor\u2014\nwhile providing necessary skills training\u2014from the project \narea for the road improvement works. \n\nProject areas  both on the Tajik and the Kyrgyz sides are \ninhabited  by  Kyrgyz  and  Tajik  people.  In  both  countries \nthe  two  ethnic  groups  live  in  harmony  and  equally \nparticipate  in  the  market  economy,  local  politics,  and \nnational cultural processes. No groups with characteristics \nof  indigenous  people,  as  defined  by  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous People, will be affected by the project. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are at early stages of \nthe  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  HIV/AIDS,  however,  has  been \nidentified  as  a  potential  risk.  The  ongoing  ADB-financed \nthe  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road \nPhase \nRehabilitation  Project  in  Tajikistan  and  the  Southern \nTransport  Corridor  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  in  Kyrgyz \nRepublic include specific components to build capacity in \nlocal \nnongovernment \norganizations  in  preventing  HIV/AIDS  and  migration,  as \nwell  as  clinical  support  through  providing  HIV  testing  kits \nand  sexually  transmitted  infections  treatment  packages. \nBoth  projects  involve  the  project  zone  and  thus  cover \ncurrent  project  areas.  Specific  provisions  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents  for  civil \nworks with built-in monitoring and awareness campaigns. \n\ngovernment \n\nagencies \n\nII  of \n\nand \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11       59   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\nSUMMARY SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nIntroduction and Background \n\nThe Republic of Tajikistan has requested $46 million in loan and grant from the \n1. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to undertake the Regional Road Corridor Improvement \nProject involving rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road. This section of road \nis some 121 kilometers (km) long and takes in km 217 to km 337 of the existing road in \nTajikistan. The project objective is to rehabilitate and selectively widen the road within the \nlimits  of  the  existing  right-of-way  (ROW).  It  will  entail  very  limited  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR). No impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged.  \n \nIn order to plan the compensation and rehabilitation of the few families affected \n2. \nby  the  Project,  a  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP) 1  was  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of \nTransport  and  Communication  (MOTC),  the  Executing  Agency.  The  SRP  is,  so  far, \nbased  on  advanced  preliminary  design  and  therefore  will  need  updating  before  its \nimplementation.  The  document\u2019s  objective  is  to  detail  an  effective  action  plan  to \ncompensate  the  affected  persons  based  on  sound  planning  principles  and  the \nrequirements  of  Tajikistan  laws  and  the  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The \ndocument \nimpacts \nassessment  and  affected  persons  survey,  and  a  preliminary  valuation  of  the  affected \nassets at replacement cost. \n \n3. \nconditionalities to project implementation: \n\nBased  on  ADB  practice  the  SRP  established  the  following  LAR-related \n\nintensive  stakeholder  consultation,  a  detailed \n\nis  based  on \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nApproval  of  contract  award.  Updated  SRP  based  on  a  fixed  corridor, \nfinal definition of compensation rates, and a detailed plan for preparation \nof the needed replacement plots. \nADB approval of civil works mobilization in the field. Full implementation \nof the compensation and rehabilitation detailed in the final resettlement plan, \nincluding  delivery  of  compensation  to  the  affected  persons,  will  be  a \ncondition of ADB approval of civil works mobilization in the field. \n\nSpecific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n4. \nThe Project will affect 27 families (228 persons). The 27 plots affected are small \nparcels of land occupied by the affected households\u2019 premises and by sheds which are \nencroaching  into  the  road  corridor.  In  all,  these  land-use  impacts  amount  to  1,843 \nsquare meters (m2). Seven houses are affected for a total of 839 m2. Twenty-four sheds \nare affected are a total of 1,004 m2. All houses but two are mildly affected and, based on \nthe choices of their owners, will not be relocated. The trees affected include 62 poplars \nand willows. \n \nC. \n\nResettlement Framework \n\n5. \nThe  SRP  is  based  on  the  following  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least \nminimized,  (ii)  compensation  will  ensure  maintenance  of  the  affected  persons\u2019  pre-project \n\n                                                 \n1   Based on the benchmark for impact significance, and given the number of affected persons and types of \nimpacts  they  suffer,  this  Project  will  not  cause  severe  losses.  Therefore,  only  a  short  resettlement  plan \nwas prepared. \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nliving standards, (iii) affected persons will be fully informed and consulted on compensation \noptions, (iv) affected persons\u2019 sociocultural institutions will be supported and used, (v) LAR \nprovisions  will  apply  equally  to  both  genders,  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to \ncompensation  and/or  rehabilitation,  (vii)  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  female-headed \nhouseholds and vulnerable groups, (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral \npart of the Project and LAR budgets will be included in project costs, and (ix) compensation \nwill be fully provided prior to ground leveling and demolition. The SRP also covers all issues \nrelevant for the effective conduct of LAR tasks so as to fit ADB policy (see next paragraphs) \nand sets the following eligibility and entitlement provisions:  \n \n\nTable A11: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitlement \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nLoss Type  Application Affected \nFamily \n\nNo of \nAffected \nFamilies \n28 \nhouseholds\n\nBuilding \nowner \n\nLand use   Loss of \nbuilding \npremises \npartly \nencroaching \ninto right-of-\nway \n\nHouses  Within and \n\nOwner \n\n7 \nhouseholds\n\nnext to \nright-of-way \n\nStructures  \n(sheds or \nparts \nthereof) \n\nWithin and \nnext to \nright-of-way \n\nOwner \n\n24 \nhouseholds\n\n- Cash rehabilitation based \non land market rate \n- provision of new plot   \n\nFull cash compensation at \nreplacement cost free of \ndepreciation, transaction \ncosts, taxes, and salvaged \nmaterials (TJS285 /m2) \n\nFull cash compensation at \nreplacement cost free of \ndepreciation, transaction \ncosts, taxes, and salvaged \nmaterials (TJS100 /m2) \n\nWithin and \nnext to \nright-of-way \n\nOwner \n\n6 \nhouseholds\n\nFull cash compensation \nbased on wood value \n(TJS50 /tree) \n\nRelocating   Owner \n\nTJS500 /household \n\n1 \nhousehold \n(allow 3 \nhouseholds \nprovisional)\n1 \nhousehold\n\nOwner \n\nTJS500 /household \n\nTree losses \n(poplar or \nwillow \ntrees) \nTransitional \nliving \nand/or \ntransport \nallowance \nVulnerable \nhousehold \nsupport \n\n1 female- \nheaded \nhousehold \nlosing a \nhouse \n\nof \n\non \n\npersons, \n\nTransport \n\nconsultation  with \nBased \naffected \n26  mildly \naffected  households  chose  cash \ncompensation  while  2  severely \naffected  households  want  to  be \nrelocated  and  receive  replacement \nplots.  Alternate  plots  acceptable  to \nthe  resettling  households  must  be \nprepared.  \nProject  implementation  unit  within \nMinistry \nand \nCommunications  will  assign  one \nofficer  in  charge  of  resettlement \nand  will  be  directly  responsible  to \nplanning, \ncoordinate \nthe \nfinancing,  and \nimplementation, \nreporting  of  resettlement  for  the \nProject.  The  Tajikabad  Rayon\n(district)  and \njomoat\nits \n(village  cluster)  governments  will \ntake  primary  responsibility  for  the \nresettlement \nconsultation, \nimplementation, and timely delivery \nof entitlements. \n\nthree \n\na  Other  impacts  so  far  unidentified  may  occur  during  implementation.  This  entitlement  matrix  and \ndescription of compensation entitlements will be revised and updated accordingly. \nSource(s): Project preparatory technical assistance consultant, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6. \nInstitutional Responsibilities. The Government of Tajikistan will bear the costs \nof  all  resettlement  activities  related  to  the  Project.  The  MOTC  will  assume  overall \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11       61   \n\n \n\nresponsibility for implementing resettlement according to the approved SRP. The project \nimplementation  unit  within  MOTC  will  assign  one  officer  in  charge  of  resettlement  and \nwill  be  directly  responsible  to  coordinate  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and \nreporting  of  resettlement  for  the  Project.  The  local  governments,  namely  the  Tajikabad \nRayon (District) and its three jomoat (village cluster) governments, will take the primary \nresponsibility  for  land  administration,  valuation,  and  acquisition  and  will  be  directly \ninvolved in stakeholder consultation, LAR implementation, and timely entitlement. \n \nDisclosure and Public Consultation. The 2004 Land Code requires disclosure \n7. \nand consultation with affected persons. The affected persons have been notified about \nthe  key  elements  of  the  SRP  during  meetings  and  interviews.  Prior  to  implementation, \nthere  will  be  further  consultations  arranged  by  local  authorities  to  discuss  specific \nimpacts  in  each  household  and  the  resettlement  scope,  expected  time  frame, \ncompensation  rates  for  assets,  other  assistance  to  replace  assets,  relocation,  and  the \ngrievance redress mechanisms. The local authority will ensure that any concerns raised \nby  the  affected  persons  are  quickly  addressed.  As  an  appraisal  condition,  the  SRP  in \nEnglish will be disclosed on the ADB website while the SRP in Tajik will be disclosed in \nthe affected persons\u2019 communities. \n \n8. \nComplaints  and  Grievances.  In  case  of  grievance,  all  complaints  will  be \nprocessed  based  on  Article  47,  Chapter  7  of  the  Land  Code  of  Tajikistan  (2004). \nAffected  people  will  submit  their  oral  or  written  complaints  first  to  the  local  land \ncommittees. If their complaints are not settled satisfactorily, they can appeal in court. \n \nFinance  and  Implementation  Schedule.  The  total  budget  is  about  $129,000, \n9. \nincluding all costs for compensation, subsidy, allowance, administration, and monitoring \nand  evaluation.  MOTC  will  guarantee  to  supplement  the  resettlement  budget,  as  may \nprove  necessary,  to  meet  any  shortfall  which  emerges  in  achieving  the  resettlement \nobjectives. The resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared in accordance \nwith the Project\u2019s construction timetable agreed by MOTC and ADB. \n \n10.  Monitoring  Arrangements.  Due  to  the  minor  impacts  that  the  Project  has  on \nhouseholds, simple process monitoring will be carried out to check that households are \ncompensated sufficiently and in a timely manner. Internal monitoring and evaluation will \nbe undertaken by the project implementation unit and reported to ADB through quarterly \nprogress reports. A budget of TJS53,280 ($15,500) was allocated for internal monitoring. \nExternal  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  international  and/or  national  construction \nsupervision  consultants  under  the  project  performance  management  system.  Both \ndomestic and external monitoring and evaluation will be integrated with Phase II. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 September 2007) \n", "TAJIKISTAN \n \n", "Currency Unit\nTJS1.00\n$1.00\n", "somoni (TJS) \n$0.2905 \nTJS3.4418 \n", " \nKYRGYZ REPUBLIC \n \n", "Currency Unit\nSom1.00\n$1.00\n", "som (Som) \n$0.0264 \nSom37.8100 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "AADT \nADB \nCAR \nCAREC \nCBA \nDEP \nEA \nEIRR \nFSU \nGDP \nHIV/AIDS \nICB \nIEE \nKGZMOTC \nLAR \nMOT \nMOTC \nNCB \nPBM \nPIU \nPMIS \nPPMS \nPPTA \nPRC \nROW \nRP \nSIEE \nSRP \nTA \nTAJMOTC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "annual average daily traffic \nAsian Development Bank \nCentral Asian republic \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \ncross-border agreement \nMinistry of Transport and Communications depot \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nformer Soviet Union \ngross domestic product \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nKyrgyz Ministry of Transport and Communications \nland acquisition and resettlement  \nMinistry of Transport \nMinistry of Transport and Communications \nnational competitive bidding \nperformance-based maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject management information system \nproject performance management system \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nright-of-way \nresettlement plan \nsummary initial environmental examination \nshort resettlement plan \ntechnical assistance \nTajik Ministry of Transport and Communications \n", "NOTES \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leaders \n", "Team members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "L.
