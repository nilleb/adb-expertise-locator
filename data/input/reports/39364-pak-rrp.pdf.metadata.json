An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  of  a \nsubproject was undertaken. \n \nThe sector Project will support the Punjab government\u2019s efforts to \ndevelop  water  resources  and  improve  their  management  in  four \ndistricts  of  the  barani  areas  of  Punjab  that  suffer  from  water \nscarcity. The Project intends to improve households\u2019 income and \nhealth  by  increasing  crop  and  livestock  productivity  through \nirrigation  development  and  increased  access  to  water  and \nsanitation. Activities  will include (i) the construction of dams and \nappurtenant  structures  to  increase  water  availability  in  the  area; \n(ii) watershed management to enhance the dams\u2019 life expectancy; \n(iii)  development  of  the  rural  water  supply  for communities  in  the \nvicinity  of  the  dam;  (iv)  development  of  community-managed \nirrigation distribution network; (v) agriculture extension services to \nsupport  the  transition  to  irrigated  agriculture;  and  (vi)  institutional \nsupport.  The  Project  will  also  rehabilitate  and  develop  irrigation \nschemes,  provide  extension  support,  and  improve  watershed \nmanagement  in  existing  dams.  To  address  the  problem  of \nsustainability and low economic returns observed in previous dam \nprojects  in  barani  areas,  the  Project  will  change  the  subsector \nimplementation  practices  and  follow  an  integrated  approach \nlooking  simultaneously  at  dam  development,  watershed \nmanagement,  and  command  area  development.  Similarly,  it  will \nsupport devolution of the water scheme to organized water users \nand  foster  a  demand-driven  approach  through  the  inclusion  of \nsocial mobilization support. \n \nAbout  one  quarter  of  Pakistan\u2019s  cultivable  area  remains  outside \nthe \nlow \nagricultural productivity. In Punjab, about 19% of cultivable lands \nlie  in  barani  areas  where  local  rain-fed  farming  systems  and \nexisting  water  sources  can  no  longer  support  the  growing  local \npopulation.  Yet  significant  gains  in  agriculture  and  livestock \nproductivity and related economic growth can be obtained through \nwater  resources  development  for  which  little  investment  support \nhas  been  made  available  to  date.  With  suitable  topography  and \n\nIndus  canal  system  and  suffers \n\nfrom  chronically \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nComponents and \nOutputs \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nto  prevent \n\nfast  sedimentation,  and \n\nrainfall,  the  best  potential  option  is  the  development  of  water \nstorage  through  the  construction  of  dams.  Previous  experiences \nshow,  however,  that  an  integrated  approach  must  be  used  in \ndeveloping  dams  in  barani  areas  to  ensure  the  full  attainment  of \nthe  potential  economic  benefits.  As  such,  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure  will  need  to  be  demand-driven  and  accompanied \nwith the development of community-managed irrigation schemes, \non-farm  water  management  support,  irrigated  agriculture  support \nservices,  and  support  for  developing  market  linkages,  watershed \nconservation \ntargeted \ninterventions  to  ensure  the  full  development  of  stored  water  for \ndomestic water supplies. \n \nThe Project\u2019s impact is to improve households\u2019 income and health \nin the districts of Attock, Rawalpindi, Jhelum, and Chakwal in the \nbarani  areas  of  Punjab  province.  The  Project\u2019s  outcome  is  to \nincrease  agriculture  and  livestock  productivity  and  household \naccess to domestic water supply. \n \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following \nincreased  sustainable  water  storage  capacity; \noutputs: \n(ii) sustainable and profitable command areas and domestic water \nsupply developed; and (iii) enhanced dam planning, management, \nand implementation capacity. The second output has the following \ncomponents:  (i)  developed  sustainable  rural  water  supplies  and \nsanitation  and \ntowns\u2019  domestic  water \nentitlements, (ii) efficient community-based management irrigation \nschemes, and (iii) improved farmers\u2019 access to production support \nand market services. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $104.5  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $14.4 million equivalent. \nFinancial  charges  during  implementation  (comprising  interest \nduring implementation and commitment charges) are estimated at \n$7.5 million. \n \nThe Government has requested a loan of $75 million\u2015$55 million \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR)  and  $20  million  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund  (ADF)\u2015to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loans  will  finance \n71.8% of the project cost.  \n\nincreased  small \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $55,000,000  from  the  OCR  of  ADB  will  be  provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nThe  ADF  loan  equivalent  to  $20  million  will  have  a  32-year  term \n\n\f \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii\n\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n\nThe  Government  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  to  the \nPunjab  government  upon  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to \nADB  and  will  cause  the  Punjab  government  to  apply  such \nproceeds  to  the  financing  of  expenditures  on  the  Project  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan  Agreements  and  the \nProject Agreement. \n \n1 July 2008\u201331 December 2014 \n \n30 June 2014  \n\nfrom \n\n \nPunjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD) \n \nPIPD will be the Executing Agency for the Project and responsible \nfor  overall  project  management  and  implementation.  A  PMU \nheaded  by  a  PIPD-appointed  project  director  will  be  established. \nThree  PMU  field  offices,  one  for  Attock  and  Rawalpindi  districts, \none  for  Chakwal  district,  and  one  for  Jhelum  district  will  be \nestablished.  Each  office  will  be  staffed  with  a  full-time  specialist \nseconded \nthe  Punjab  government  departments  of \nagriculture,  livestock,  and  forestry.  The  PMU  will  assume  the \nfollowing roles: (i) overall interagency and district coordination; (ii) \nrecruiting  consultants  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \nand awarding procurement and consulting contracts, as well as all \nproject  financial  management;  (iii)  consolidating,  reviewing,  and \nsubmitting  regular  progress  and  financial  reports  to  the  Project \nSteering  Committee  (PSC)  and  ADB;  and  (iv)  monitoring  and \nevaluating  project  outputs  and  results.  The  PMU  will  also  be \nresponsible for directly implementing the watershed management \nactivities  under  the  first,  second,  and  third  outputs.  The  Small \nDams  Organization  (SDO)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \ndam planning and construction activities under the first output. In \nimplementing  those  activities,  SDO  will  receive  specific  advisory \nsupport  on  safeguard  and  technical  matters  from  the  PMU.  For \neach  subproject  under  its  responsibility,  SDO  will  appoint  a \nsubdivisional  officer  who  will  supervise  the  dam  feasibility  and, \ndetail  design  studies,  and \nthe  engineering  construction \nsupervision consultants. In implementing the water supply-related \nactivities,  the  PMU  will  involve  the  relevant  tehsil  municipal \nadministration  (TMAs)  in  (i)  assessing  the  demand  for  water \nsupplies,  (ii)  organizing  the  future  water  supply  users,  and  (iii) \nsupervising the overall execution of works and services related to \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\nwater supply activities.1  \n\nthe \n\nfirst  batch  will  start  before \n\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  the  subprojects  will  be \nprepared in batches equivalent to 2,000 hectares (ha) of irrigated \nagriculture  development  (between  one  and  four  subprojects). \nThere  will  be  a  total  of  four  batches  in  addition  to  the  core \nsubproject.    All  subprojects  in  each  batch  will  be  prepared \nsimultaneously by SDO and the contract awarded by the PMU to \nonly  two  contractors.  One  contract  will  be  awarded  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  feasibility  study,  the  detailed  design,  and \nconstruction  supervision,  while  the  other  one  will  be  awarded  for \nthe  construction  of  the  dams,  the  main  channel,  and  water \nsupplies.  Implementation  of  both  contracts  will  be  supervised  by \nSDO.  Watersheds  and  command  area-related  works  will  be \ntendered  after  organization  of  the  farmer  organizations  and \nparticipatory  planning.  The  PMU  will  prepare  the  technical \nspecification and award the works to ideally one single contractor \nper  batch.2  Contract  implementation  will  be  supervised  by  the \nPMU. The timing between batches will be minimized. As soon as \nthe  PMU  and  SDO  finish  the  identification  and  the  pre-feasibility \nstudies of the first batch, preparation of the second batch will start. \nThe  preparation  of \nloan \neffectiveness  and  the  social  mobilizers  will  be  recruited  in \nadvance though retro-active financing to ensure that the demand-\ndriven approach is carried out. \n \nEquipment,  materials,  goods,  and  services  for  ADB-financed \ncontracts  will  be  procured \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. Civil works contracts will be split between (i) dam and \nassociated  construction  works,  and \n(ii)  command  area \ndevelopment works. For each subproject, the procurement of civil \nworks worth $10 million or less should be awarded to suitable pre-\nqualified contractors following  national competitive bidding  (NCB) \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  as  national  contracting  capacity \nexists to successfully undertake these works. Civil works contracts \ncosting  more \nthan  $10.0  million  will  be  awarded  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  to  suitable  prequalified \ncontractors. ADB will review at least the first three NCB contracts \nawarded. Equipment and materials worth less than $100,000 will \nbe  procured  through  the  shopping  mode.  The  procurement  plan \nwill  be  updated  at  least  annually,  covering  the  first  18  months  of \nprocurement  activity.  NCB  procedures  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  Government's  Public  Procurement  Rules \n2004,  subject  to  the  clarification  of  the  rules  that  have  been \nagreed  upon  with  ADB  for  the  purpose  of  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).   \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 Feasibility studies, detailed  design, construction  and  engineering supervision  of  water supplies  will  be undertaken \n\nby the firms engaged for dam construction. \n\n2 The watershed and command area works design requires time for social mobilization and participatory planning and \ntherefore cannot be packaged under the same package as the dam, appurtenant structures, and water supplies.  \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  651  person-months  of  national \nand 46 person-months of international consulting services through \nboth  consulting  firms  and  individual  consultants.  All  consulting \nservices will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n  \nSocial  mobilization  for  the  Project  will  be  provided  by  a  qualified \nlocal  NGO  to  be  recruited  through  the  quality-  and  cost-based \n(QCBS)  method  using  a  full  technical  proposal.  The  training  and \nmentoring  services  on  participatory  extension  services  (Farmers \nField  School)  will  be  provided  by  Commonwealth  Assistance \nBureau  International  (CABI)  using  single  source  selection  as  this \norganization  has  (i)  unique  expertise  and  (ii)  demonstrated  good \ntrack  record  in  the  delivery  of  such  services.  Consulting  services \nwill  also  be  required  to  produce  (i)  subproject  feasibility  studies; \n(ii)  detailed  designs  and  construction  supervision;  and \nthese  services, \n(iii) environment  assessment  studies.  For \nconsulting  firms  will  be  recruited  through  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection (QCBS) and the consultant qualification selection \n(CQS) method. \n \nThe  Project  should  increase  the  agricultural  income  of  20,000 \nhouseholds  (160,000  people)  and  provide  increased  and  clean \ndomestic  water  to  9,050  households  (72,400  people).  Other \nbenefits  are  (i)  the  provision  of  bulk  water  to  municipalities,  and \nreforestation  and  land  erosion  control  in  the  dam  watershed,  as \nwell  as  (ii)  increased  production  opportunities  for  private  fish \ngrowers. The core subproject\u2019s economic internal rate of return is \n14.3%. \n \nThe  design  assumes  that  community  mobilization  can  be  carried \nout  effectively  to  ensure  a  demand-driven  approach  in  dam \nselection  and  the  formation  of  farmer  organizations.  The  social \nmobilization teams, staffed with an adequate gender balance and \ntrained  by  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Authority  (PIDA),  will \nenable  the  Project  to  work  with  organized  community  groups, \nmaximize positive impact on women, and support the formation of \nlegally autonomous farmer organizations. \n \nThe  demand-driven  and  integrated  approach  requires  good \ncoordination  between  the  different  activities  and  precise  phasing \nbetween \nto  ensure  synergies  and  avoid \nimplementation delays. The project implementation arrangements \nhave  been  designed  to  avoid  interagency  coordination  problems, \nreduce procurement delays, and facilitate contract management. \n \nPolitical  stability  in  Pakistan  has  deteriorated  recently  and  could \nfurther  deteriorate  with  the  election  process.

The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \nA. \n  \n \n2. \nPakistan  is  known  for  its  significant  development  of  water  resources,  particularly  the \nIndus River irrigation system, which is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world. The \nsystem  supplies  irrigation  water  to  over  14.9  million  hectares  (ha),  and  has  transformed \nagriculture and improved the livelihood of tens of millions of Pakistanis. However, about 25% of \nPakistan\u2019s  cultivable  area  remains  outside  the  Indus  River  system  and  suffers  from  low \nagricultural productivity.  \n \n3. \nIn  Punjab,  the  Indus  River  system  irrigates  8.4  million  ha  and  irrigated  agriculture  (i) \naccounts  for  28%  of  Punjab\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  output,  (ii)  employs  54%  of  the \nlabor  force,  (iii)  produces  90%  of  agricultural  output,  and  (iv)  uses  over  95%  of  the  water \nresources.  The  province  contributes  about  58%  of  the  national  GDP,  and  66%  of  the  national \nagricultural GDP. In Punjab, about 19% of cultivable lands lie in these barani1 areas, mainly in \nthe  Pothowar  plateau  between  the  Indus  and  Jhelum  rivers.  The  plateau  covers  an  area  of \n2.2 million ha, of which 1.0 million ha is under rain-fed agriculture.  \n \n4. \nAgriculture and livestock have been the traditional sources of revenue for people of the \nPothowar  plateau.  With  no  or  limited  secure  water  sources,  farming  is  almost  exclusively \ndependent  on  rainfall,  which  is  irregular  in  both  annual  and  seasonal  amounts  as  well  as \nintensity  in  any  given  storm  event.  The  traditional  crops  are  wheat  and  gram  in  winter  and \nsorghum,  millet,  groundnuts,  or  maize  in  summer  when  rainfall  is  sufficient.  A  fallow  period \nbetween two crops is common and, on average, the farmers get a reasonable harvest every 4\u20135 \nyears.  Although  barani  agriculture  uses  limited  inputs,  the  grain  production  rarely  justifies  the \ninvestment  made.  Average  yields  remain  typically  100\u2013150%  lower  than  those  from  irrigated \nagriculture.  Only  the  strong  integration  of  livestock  with  agriculture,  developed  over  the \ncenturies by barani farmers, has rendered barani farming systems viable. The strategy consists \nof  cultivating  crops  that  can  easily  be  converted  into  quality  fodder  when  the  rainfall  does  not \nallow full maturation. In good years, the grain and cash crop harvested is seen as a bonus that \nwill  lower  the  number  of  head  of  livestock  to  be  sold  to  support  the  household.  Livestock \nproduction is therefore the main output of barani farming systems. \n \nWith  the  increasing  fragmentation  of  landholding2  due  to  population  growth  and  limited \n5. \nimprovement in agriculture and livestock productivity, these traditional farming strategies are no \nlonger adequate to sustain households. Significant numbers of barani households are gradually \nmoving to the off-farm sectors for livelihood opportunities, mainly through temporary migration to \nthe cities or abroad. While migration would appear to be a necessary strategy for some of the \nexcess labor force, barani areas remain home to 4.2 million people and agriculture still accounts \nfor 40% of their income. Improvement in their livelihood, especially for a large majority of small \nlandholders  and  tenant  farmers,  will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  gains  in  agriculture  and \n                                                 \n1  Barani areas traditionally depend on rain-fed agriculture. However, the percentages given here cover also pockets \nof irrigated agriculture developed with a limited source of water. The Project will focus on areas dependent on rain-\nfed agriculture. \n\n2  Approximately 60% of the farms are below subsistence size of 2 ha in Punjab. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nlivestock productivity and growth in the local nonfarm sector. In barani areas, water scarcity is \nthe  major  impediment  to  development.  It  prevents  the  establishment  of  productive  irrigated \nagriculture and poses a major challenge for the provision of domestic water supply to the quickly \ngrowing rural communities and small towns located in barani areas.  \n \n6. \nWhile figures from the government of Punjab indicate that between 75% and 80% of the \npopulation  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water  in  the  Pothowar  plateau,  the  real  availability  of \nwater to households in this area is extremely limited. Reliable perennial water sources, including  \ngroundwater,  are  very  scarce,  so  while  a  modern  water  supply  system  may  be  present, \ngenerally  the  population  gets  water for  only  a  couple  of  hours  per  day  throughout most  of  the \nyear.  This  constraint    seriously  impedes  the  sustainable  development  of  local  industrial  and \nservice activities, and causes a loss of productive potential in families, mainly women, who may \nspend hours collecting water  daily. \n \n7. \nAs  early  as  in  the  1960s,  dams  were  developed  to  increase  water  availability  in  the \nPothowar plateau. To date, a total of 50 dams from 11 to 40 meters (m) high and with reservoir \nstorage of from 600,000 to 54 million cubic meters (m3) have been commissioned by the Small \nDams  Organization  (SDO)  under  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD),  with  a \ntotal canal command area of around 24,500 ha. This storage represents 12% of the estimated \n2,320  million  m3  total  runoff  generated  in  the  plateau  and  only  a  small  portion  of  the  many \npotential dam sites that have already been identified. Traditionally, the major beneficiaries of the \ndams  are  the  communities  having  irrigable  land  in  the  vicinity  of  the  dams  and  the  population \nlocated  close  enough  to  be  provided  with  potable  water  for  their  own  consumption,  their \nlivestock  use,  or  to  support  their  nonfarm  activities.  While  these  projects  have  improved \nagricultural production and ensured drinking water supplies, it is believed that their full potential \nhas  not  been  realized  and,  as  of  today,  their  economic  performance  remains  below \nexpectations. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems, Lessons Learned, and Opportunities \n\n8. \nKey  Problems  and  Lessons  Learned.  Without  secured  water  sources  for  irrigation, \nfarming in barani areas is both a low-productivity and high-risk venture that often cannot sustain \nthe  current  population\u2019s  need.  Although  some  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  rain-fed \nagriculture productivity, the risk of crop failure remains too high for farmers to adopt more costly \ninput packages necessary to substantially intensify agricultural activities. Reliable water sources \nprovide the best factor for agricultural intensification as well as improved domestic water supply \nin  the  Pothowar  plateau.  Due  to  topography  and  existing  water  demand,  the  transfer  of  water \nfrom the Indus River is not possible. The only option available is to use local water sources. As \ngroundwater resources are extremely limited and can only contribute marginally to water supply, \nsurface  water  resources  are  of  critical  importance.  With  a  mean  annual  rainfall  of  600\u2013800 \nmillimeters\u2015of  which  60%  occurs  from  mid-July  to  the  end  of  August\u2015and  a  suitable \ntopography and geology, water storage is the most promising option. Available technical options \ninclude the development of mini dams, ponds, water tanks, and the construction of dams. The \nlast  option  has  the  highest  potential  as  dams  are  less  sensitive  to  evaporation  losses  and \nsedimentation than are shallow smaller storages.  \n \n9. \nThe performance of dams in Pothowar and adoption of irrigated agriculture in the dam \ncommand areas have been constrained by (i) lack of a fully integrated approach incorporating \neffective  command  area  development  and  watershed  management,  (ii)  little  effective \ncommunity  participation  in  selecting  and  developing  projects,  and  (iii)  the  need  to  strengthen \nthe  institutional  framework  for  the  management,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \ndams. \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n3\n\nAgricultural benefits have not materialized due to the failure to support the development \n10. \nof the irrigation distribution system and to engage and empower the future water users. In the \ndevelopment of most dams, the emphasis was on the construction of the dam and the feeder \ncanal  to  the  command  area.  There  was  little  support  for  (i)  developing  an  efficient  irrigation \ndistribution  network  (including  lined  watercourses  or  pressurized  systems);  (ii)  establishing  a \nwater rotation schedule; (iii) organizing and training water users, and (iv) providing agricultural \nextension  services  necessary  to  support  the  transition  from  rain-fed  agriculture  to  irrigated \nagriculture. This lack of support contributed to the slow development of the command area and \nthe limited adoption by farmers of more productive practices and high-value crops.  \n \n11. \nInadequate  attention  was  given  to  sedimentation  in  previous  dam  projects.  Sample \nsurveys  have  indicated  that  sediment  inflow  can  be  high  and  while  there  is  considerable \nvariability from site to site, water storage capacity loss in the region can be as high as 4.2% per \nyear,  which  means  full  siltation  of  some  existing  dam  dead  storage  after  24  years.  Empirical \nevidence has demonstrated that for a few dams, the sedimentation rate is higher. The impact \nthat premature siltation of these dams has on their beneficiary communities, even beyond the \ndam\u2019s economic life, calls for attention. In particular, the watershed condition and the need for \na  management  plan  should  be  studied  at  the  feasibility  stage  and  a  monitoring  and  erosion \ncontrol program established in the dam watershed after construction. \n \n12.  Most  of  the  dams  are  built  following  a  supply-driven  approach.  Sites  are  identified \nthrough  reconnaissance  exercises  conducted  by  SDO  staff  that  give  cursory  consideration  to \nhydrology, topography, and geology and focus mainly on the availability of a good geographic \nsite for dam construction. The demand and interest of the future beneficiaries are not factored \ninto  the  decision  to  build  a  dam  and  consultation  with  the  community  at  large  is  considered \npotentially  disruptive  of  the  dam  construction  process.  The  result  is  little  community  interest, \nownership, or readiness to participate in developing the command areas.  \n\nThe necessity to adopt an integrated approach to dam development in Pothowar and to \n13. \npromote devolution of the irrigation schemes to farmers\u2019 organizations was already suggested in \na previous Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed project (Loan 0750-PAK[SF]).3 To ensure \nthe necessary integration, the project design opted to allocate a budget to the various technical \ndepartments  (agriculture,  irrigation,  forestry,  and  livestock).  This  approach  failed  to  deliver  the \nintended results due to the reluctance of the departments to coordinate their activities.  Another \nlesson learned from that project is that forming farmer organizations and devolving functions to \nthem  will  not  happen  if  no  specific  assistance  is  included  in  the  project  design.  A  detailed \ndiscussion of lessons learned is presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n14. \nInstitutional  Issues.  While  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Authority  (PIDA)  Act \n(1997)  and  the  accompanying  farmer  organization  rules  and  regulations  of  1999  provide  an \ninstitutional  framework  for  decentralization  and  devolution  of  irrigation  management  to  farmer \norganizations, new dam irrigation networks continue to be managed by SDO. SDO controls both \nwater releases and distribution and is in charge of the maintenance of the dam and the irrigation \nscheme.  In most cases, the failure to develop the water rotation schedule has led to inequitable \nwater  allocations  and  water  wastage,  preventing  the  development  of  the  full  command  area. \nSimilarly,  lack  of  O&M  has  caused  substantial  deferred  maintenance,  which,  combined  with \ninitially poor command area development, has resulted in severely degraded physical conditions \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1985.

Several  degraded  systems  have  water  losses as  high  as \n50%, which significantly affects tail-end farmers.4 \n\n \n15. \nAlthough  the  number  of  dams  supplying  domestic  water  has  increased  substantially \nduring the past 5 years, this water supply function remains underdeveloped. SDO institutionally \ngives  priority  to  agricultural  development  rather  than  domestic  water  supply,  as  the  latter \nmandate  belongs  to  the  TMAs.  PIPD  acknowledges  the  need  to  articulate  policies  for \nentitlement, management, and pricing of dam water resources to ensure equitable access to the \nvarious end users. However, due to budget constraints, rural communities residing in the vicinity \nof  the  dam,  which  may  have  an  entitlement,  will  still  have  difficulty  in  getting  their  rural  water \nsupply financed by TMA.   \n \nIn adopting an improved dam development approach, a number of subsector institutional \n16. \nissues will need to be addressed. Among them are (i) creating a dam safety and sedimentation \nmonitoring unit in PIPD to ensure regular safety inspection and sedimentation controls;5 and (ii)  \nlimiting  SDO\u2019s  responsibilities  to  dam  planning,  commissioning,  and  O&M  only,  and  their \ncapacity reinforced in those aspects. Feasibility studies, traditionally undertaken by SDO, should \nbe contracted out to the private sector as SDO has limited qualified personnel available for this \npurpose. A more detailed sector and institutional analysis is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nOpportunities.  The  recent  prolonged  drought  from  2001  to  2003  has  revived  the \n17. \ngovernment  of  Punjab\u2019s \nin  enhancing  agricultural  productivity  and  economic \ndevelopment  in  barani  areas  through  the  development  of  dams.  It  is  a  clear  strategy  and \ninvestment  priority  in  both  the  2003  Water  Sector  Strategy  and  the  2005  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Framework,6 and has led to the commissioning of 20 new dams to be completed \nby  2008.  In  the  new  2007\u20132010  Medium-Term  Investment  Plan,  the  government  of  Punjab \nincludes a new budget allocation of $83 million for developing new dam projects in the Pothowar \nplateau. No external assistance has been provided to dam development projects, except for a \n$500,000 grant from the Austrian Government to finance watershed management pilot initiatives \n(Appendix 3).  \n \n18. \nPIPD  acknowledges  the  need  for  an  integrated  approach  to  dam  project  development \nlooking  simultaneously  at  social  mobilization,  construction  of  a  dam  and  irrigation  distribution \nnetwork,  watershed  management,  water  management,  agriculture  extension  support  services \nas  well  as water  supply  and  other  uses.  PIPD  has  already  launched a  3-year  pilot  initiative  of \n$2.7 million financed by the Government of Pakistan to improve the dam command area of four \noperating dams. A number of dams recently built or already operating need similar investment \nto  develop  or  rehabilitate  their  distribution  system,  organize  their  farmers,  and  develop  more \nintensive  farming  systems.  Watershed  management  has  been  included  recently  in  a  few  dam \ndevelopment projects financed by PIPD, and assistance needs to be extended to some existing \ndam watersheds that require immediate attention.   \n \n19. \nFollowing promulgation of the PIDA Act, institutional reform efforts languished for nearly \na  decade  and  few  farmer  organizations  were  formed  in  Punjab.  However,  PIPD  has  made \n\ninterest \n\n                                                 \n4   Farmers who have their land located at the tail end of the irrigation network. \n5    In  2003,  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  stopped  undertaking  safety  inspection  on  small \n\ndams. \n\n6  Government of Punjab. 2005.

The  water  sector  strategy,  developed  by  the  Ministry  of  Water  and \nPower  with  the  support  of  ADB,8  was  adopted  in  2003.  It  calls  for  the  development  of  water \nresources outside the Indus canal system and identifies small storages as priority options (vol. \nII,  page  68).  The  2005  water  sector\u2019s  medium-term  investment  plan  supporting  this  strategy \nallocates a budget to construct 20 \u201csmall dams\u201d in both North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) \nand  Punjab.  The  government  of  Punjab  further  supports  this  strategy  through  its  2007\u20132010 \nmedium-term investment plan by allocating an additional $83 million for the development of new \n\u201csmall  dams\u201d  projects.  Similarly,  the  2005\u20132010  Medium-Term  Development  Framework \ndeveloped  by  the  Federal  Planning  Commission  in  coordination  with  sector  ministries  and \nprovincial  governments  supports  the  2003  water  sector  strategy.  The  framework  calls  for  the \ndevelopment of additional water storage throughout the country for irrigation and domestic water \nsupply, improved water efficiency, and integrated water resources management. Water storage \nis highlighted as a key priority for water resources development outside the Indus canal system.  \n \n21. \nAn analysis of the PIPD was conducted to assess its willingness and ability to take the \nlead  in  implementing  the  Project  and  its  capacities  for  project  management,  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and safeguard issues. The overall assessment is positive although \nredefinition  of  SDO  roles  was  suggested  as  part  of  the  sector  institutions  improvement,  and \nadditional  support  will  be  required  through  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to  strengthen \noverall  capacity  and  avoid  implementation  delays.9  In  2006,  a  Social  and  Environment \nMonitoring Unit (SEMU) was established in PIPD to provide a center of excellence for safeguard \nissues. SEMU\u2019s primary responsibility is to ensure that social and environmental issues arising \nfrom irrigation and drainage projects are properly addressed. SEMU has adequate capacity to \nensure  oversight  of  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards  of  the \nProject. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n22. \n The  impact  of  the  proposed  Barani  Integrated  Water  Resources  Sector  Project  is \nimproved  household  income  and  health  in  the  districts  of  Attock,  Rawalpindi,  Jhelum,  and \nChakwal in the barani areas of Punjab province. The four districts were selected for their high \npercentage of barani agriculture compared with other districts, and their high potential for water \nstorage development. The Project\u2019s outcome is to increase crops and livestock productivity and \nhouseholds\u2019  access  to  domestic  water  supply  by  converting  11,500  ha  of  rain-fed  agricultural \n\n                                                 \n7    ADB.  2006.

Two \nrepresentative subprojects (\u201ccore subprojects\u201d) were selected to assess the Project\u2019s feasibility \nbased  on  technical,  social,  financial,  and  economic  aspects  as  well  as  its  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards.10 \n \nC.  \n\nOutputs  \n\n23. \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  outputs:  (i)  increased \nsustainable water storage capacity; (ii) sustainable and profitable command areas and domestic \nwater  supply  developed;  and  (iii)  enhanced  dam  planning,  management,  and  implementation \ncapacity. The third output reflects sector institutional changes and capacity development needs \nfor successful project implementation and sustainability. \n\n \n1. \n\nIncreased Sustainable Water Storage Capacity \n\n24. \nThe  Project  will  increase  water  storage  capacity  by  undertaking  the  construction  of \ndams11  and  the  associated  structures  required,  identified  based  on  agreed-upon  selection \ncriteria. Sediment control measures in the dam watershed will also be implemented to prolong \nthe  dam\u2019s  life  and  improve  the  sustainability  of  the  water  storage  capacity  of  new  dams  and \nexisting dams that need urgent attention. Once a site is identified and pre-feasibility studies are \nundertaken,  the  main  activities  in  dam  construction  will  consist  of  (i)  selecting  candidate \nsubprojects for a feasibility study; (ii) contracting out the feasibility studies, environment impact \nassessments,  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  to  the  private  sector;  and  (iii) \nmobilizing  communities  during  feasibility  studies  to  ensure  full  consultation  and  participation. \nThe  selection  of  the  candidate  subproject  will  result  from  three  screenings  that  will  take  place \nafter  (i)  identification,  (ii) pre-feasibility  study,  and  (iii)  feasibility  study.  Mandatory  associated \nactivities will include: (i) preparing the land acquisition and resettlement plans and implementing \nthem;  (ii)  mobilizing  a  panel  of  experts  for  approval  of  the  proposed  dam  designs;  (iii) \ncontracting  out  the  construction  of  the  dam;  and  (iv)  supervising  the  dam  impoundment.  The \ndam  construction  and  watershed  management  activities  account  for  70%  of  the  total  project \ncosts. \n \nThe  main  activities  in  watershed  management  will  consist  of  (i)  training  the  soil \n25. \nconservation  and  range  officers;  (ii)  mobilizing  the  community  and  registering  the  Citizen \nCommunity Board (CCB); (iii) preparing a watershed development plan and implementing it by  \n(a)  constructing    silt  trap  structures,  (b)  covering  major  erosion  spots  with  vegetation,  and  (c) \ncontrolling erosion in farmers\u2019 fields. \n \n\n2.  \n\nSustainable  and  Profitable  Command  Areas  and  Developed  Domestic \nWater Supply  \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  develop  sustainable  and  profitable  command  areas  and  increase \ndomestic  water  supply  through  three  interventions:  (i)  developing  sustainable  rural  water \nsupplies  and  sanitation  and  increasing  small  towns\u2019  domestic  water  entitlements;  (ii) \nestablishing  efficient  community  managed  irrigation  schemes;  and  (iii)  improving  farmers\u2019 \naccess to production support and market services. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 One subproject located in NWFP was dropped due to economic non-feasibility. Due to lower average rainfall and  \nlower  potential  for  agriculture,  developing  dams  for  irrigation  purposes  in  NWFP  barani  areas  appears  less \npromising than in Punjab.  \n\n11  The  dams  will  range  from  approximately  12  to  45  meters  high,  with  gross  storage  capacity  from  500,000  to  50     \n\nmillion cm3. \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n7\n\n \n \n27. \nThe establishment of efficient community managed irrigation schemes will apply to both \nnew dam projects and existing dam projects. It will require the following activities: (i) train SDO \nstaff and the NGO social mobilizers to form and register water users organizations;  (ii)  mobilize \nand  train water users and register them as farmers\u2019 organizations under the PIDA Act; (iii) carry \nout participatory planning of the water scheduling plans; (iv) carry out participatory design and \nconstruction (through private contractors) of the irrigation scheme including watercourses and/or \npressurized systems; and (v) level the land  for farmers.  \n \n28. \nAt the level of the water users, capacity building and institutional strengthening will focus \non user groups that will be organized during the Project to participate in building or rehabilitating \nwater distribution systems, and maintaining and operating them on a sustained basis. Given the \nvery  limited  experience  in  developing  farmer  organizations  for  dams,  these  organizations  will \nneed  a  comprehensive  package  of  measures  for  them  to  become  functioning  sustainable \ninstitutions. The project activities will enhance the capability of dam-related farmer organizations \nto  operate  and  maintain  their  distribution  network;  to  exhibit  transparency  in  decision  making, \nprocurement,  hiring,  and  contracting;  and  to  maintain  simple  accounting  systems.  Further,  the \nfarming  communities  will  be  empowered  to  define  their  water  requirements  and  monitor  the \nperformance of SDO with respect to reservoir operations.  \n \nTo  ensure  that  farmers  are  able  to  fully  optimize  their  current  farming  systems  and \n29. \neventually  diversify  toward  high-value  crops,  the  Project  will  support  on-farm  production \nimprovement  and  improved  access  to  market  services  for  both  new  irrigation  schemes  and \nrehabilitated  ones.  The  key  project  activities  will  consist  of  (i)  organizing  producers  groups; \nfield  schools; \nfarming  systems  studies;  (iii)  establishing \n(ii) undertaking  barani \n(iv) establishing participatory on-farm research and demonstration; and (v) linking farmers with \ncredit institutions, inputs suppliers, and markets. \n \n\nfarmer \n\n3.  \n\nEnhanced Dam Planning, Management, and Implementation Capacity  \n\n \n30. \nThe institutional and project implementation support output is designed to support PIPD, \nSDO,  and  the  communities  in  implementing  the  various  activities  under  the  Project.  The \nactivities to set up the PMU would consist of (i) recruiting individual consultants to fill the PMU \nmanager  posts,  (ii)  procuring  all  required  equipment,  (iii)  selecting  government  staff  to  be \nseconded to the PMU field offices, (iv) recruiting the social mobilization NGO, and (v) selecting \nand procuring the domestic and international advisory consultants. \n \n31. \nOn the institutional support side, the activities to support SDO in dam planning and O&M \nwould  consist  of  (i)  strengthening  participatory  planning  capacity  to  include  beneficiaries  and \nprospective affected persons during initial site identification; (ii) enhancing SDO staff technical \ncapacity  to  supervise  and  review  feasibility  studies  contracted  out  to  the  private  sector; \n(iii) developing standard operating procedures for dam O&M, in particular due diligence for dam \nsafety  aspects,  coordination  of  watershed  management  and  watershed  hydrology  monitoring, \nand principles for demand-responsive reservoir operations; and (iv) providing capacity building \nto  support  the  transfer  of  management  of  water  conveyance  and  distribution  infrastructure  to \nfarmer organizations on existing and new dams. \n \n32. \nAt PIPD level, institutional support will focus on the establishment of a dam safety and \nsedimentation  monitoring  unit  within  PIPD.  The  activities  will  consist  of  (i)  preparing  terms  of \nreference and engaging the consultants, (ii) developing the unit\u2019s staff curriculum, (iii) recruiting \nstaff, and (iv) providing training and equipment. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nD. \n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  support  PIPD\u2019s  efforts  to  transform  its  implementation  approach  to \ndevelopment of dams in Pothowar, strengthen the institutional framework, and help ensure that \nPIPD\u2019s  further  investments  in  dams  yield  better  returns.  The  Project  will  adopt  an  integrated \napproach  to  management  and  use  of  barani  water  resources  by  addressing  both  watershed \nconservation  upstream  of  the  dam  and  sustainable  development  of  the  command  area \ndownstream.  As  interagency  coordination  failed  to  achieve  this  integration  under  Loan  0750-\nPAK(SF)  (footnote  3),  multidisciplinary  competencies  will  instead  be  built  in  the  PMU  and  put \nunder the responsibility of a single executing agency.  A key element will be to foster a demand-\ndriven  approach  through  beneficiary  consultation  and  participation  in  identifying  and  selecting \nsubprojects  and  to  support  the  devolution  of  the  irrigation  schemes  to  organized  water  users. \nThis  will  require  substantial  inputs  in  social  mobilization  and  farmer  organizations  that  will  be \nprovided by a local NGO with support from PIDA trainers and a water management consultant.   \n \n34. \nThe  Project  will  also  adopt  a  comprehensive  approach  to  barani  farming  systems  by \nsupporting  farmers  to  optimize  their  current  farming  strategies  and  production  on  the  scale  of \ntheir  farm,  and  not  only  their  newly  irrigated  field.  Although,  farmers  will  be  provided  with \nopportunities to adopt high-value crops, they will also be supported in improving the production \nand  marketing  of  the  main  barani  production  activities  including  livestock.  The  performance  of \npublic  institutions  in  delivering  extension  services  is  too  weak  to  successfully  deliver  on  this \naspect and has deteriorated with decentralization. The Project cannot rely on devolved district \nagriculture and livestock services and will build its own team from seconded civil servants who \nwill  be  trained  by  the  Commonwealth  Assistance  Bureau  International  (CABI),  an  organization \nwith expertise in agricultural research and extension, and supported by consultants. At the end \nof the Project, these trained officers will return to their respective departments. \n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n35. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $104.5  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \nand  duties  of  $14.4  million  equivalent.  Financial  charges  during  implementation  (comprising \ninterest  during  implementation  and  commitment  charges)  are  estimated  at  $7.5  million.  Cost \nestimates  by  project  output  are  summarized  in  Table  1,  and  the  summary  financing  plan  is \npresented in Table 2. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4. \n \nF. \n \n36. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $75  million  with  $55  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR) and $20 million equivalent from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF)  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loans  will  finance  71.8%  of  the  project  cost.  The  OCR \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  and  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in \nthe draft OCR Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. The ADF loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; \nan interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  Government  will \nrelend  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  to  the  Punjab  government  upon  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  and  will  cause  the  Punjab  government  to  apply  such  proceeds  to  the \nfinancing  of  expenditures  on  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n9\n\nAgreements  and  the  Project  Agreement.  The  OCR  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  dam  and \nmain canal construction, the dam safety and dam operation building, the studies, the equipment, \nproject  management  consultants  and  the  recurrent  cost  associated  with  the  O&M  of  the  PMU \nfield  offices  vehicles.  The  ADF  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  watershed  management,  irrigation \nnetwork  and  land  leveling,  training  and  extension  activities,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  the \ntechnical  assistance  capacity  development  advisory  services  and  recurrent  costs  associated \nwith the O&M of the PMU main office vehicles. The Government will provide counterpart funds \namounting to $27.3 million, which will be used for financing the taxes, the PMU staff costs, and \nthe entire cost of land acquisition and resettlement. The beneficiaries will contribute 8.9% of the \nwatershed  management  costs,  17%  for  the  watercourses  and  land  leveling,  and  1.6%  of  the \ndomestic water supply schemes.

To carry out this responsibility effectively, PIPD will establish a PMU with \nthe following roles: (i) overall interagency and district coordination; (ii) recruitment of consultants \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand  NGOs  and  awarding  of  procurement  and  consulting  contracts,  (iii)  project  financial \nmanagement;  (iv)  consolidation,  review,  and  submission  of  regular  progress  and  financial \nreports to the project steering committee (PSC) and ADB; and (v) monitoring and evaluation of \nproject  outputs  and  results.  The  PMU  will  also  be  directly  responsible  for  implementing  the \nwatershed management activities under the first output, the second output except rehabilitation \nof  the  main  channels,  and  the  third  outputs.  SDO  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  (i)  the \ndam planning and construction for the first output, and (ii) the main channel rehabilitation for the \nsecond output. In implementing item (i), SDO will receive specific advisory support in safeguard \nand  technical  matters  from  the  PMU.  For  each  subproject  under  its  responsibility,  SDO  will \nappoint  a  subdivisional  officer  who  will  supervise  the  dam  feasibility  study,  detailed  design \nstudies,  and  the  engineering  construction  supervision  consultants.  In  implementing  the  water \nsupply-related activities, the PMU will involve the relevant TMAs in (i) assessing the demand for \nwater  supplies,  (ii)  organizing  the  future  water  supply  users,  and  (iii)  supervising  the  overall \nexecution of works and services related to water supply activities.12  \n \n38. \nThe PMU will be headed by the project director who will be appointed through an open \nand competitive process by PIPD and will be acceptable to ADB. The project director will have \n(i)  qualification  in  either  engineering,  agro-economics  or  social  sciences  and  relevant  project \nmanagerial experience; and (ii) will report to the PIPD secretary. The PMU will be staffed by full-\ntime managers for (i) watershed conservation, (ii) farming systems and marketing, (iii) on-farm \nwater management, (iv) finance,13 (v) social mobilization,14 (vi) water supply and sanitation, and \n(vi)  project  benefit  monitoring.  The  PMU  will  also  include  livestock  and  agriculture  extension \nadvisors15  as  well  as  appropriate  support  staff.  The  managers  and  advisors  will  be  recruited \nfrom  the  market  through  an  open  and  competitive  process.  In  addition,  SDO  will  assign  its \ndeputy director for planning and technical monitoring (DDPTM) to the PMU to serve as the full-\ntime civil works coordinator. As the civil works coordinator, the DDPTM will report to the project \ndirector.  \n \nThree  PMU  field  offices  will  be  established,  one  each  for  (i)  Attock  and  Rawalpindi \n39. \ndistricts, (ii) Chakwal district, and (iii) Jhelum district. Each office will be staffed with a full- time \nspecialist  seconded  from  the  following  institutions:  (i)  agriculture  extension,  on-farm  water \nmanagement,  and  soil  and  field  engineering  directorates  of  the  Punjab  Department  of \nAgriculture;  (ii)  livestock  extension  directorate  of  the  Punjab  Department  of  Livestock;  and  (iii) \nPunjab  Forest  Department.  The  specialists  will  report  directly  to  their  respective  technical \nmanager in the PMU. The NGO social mobilizers will also be posted in the field offices and will \nreport to the PMU social mobilization manager. In addition, one trainer from CABI, a specialized \ninternational NGO, will be posted in each field office.   \n \n40. \nThe  government  of  Punjab  will  establish  a  PSC  to  provide  broad  project  oversight  and \nproject-related policy guidance. This committee will be chaired by the Chairman of the Planning \nand Development Board with the following as members: the secretaries of Punjab Irrigation and \nPower,  Punjab  Agriculture,  Punjab  Livestock,  and  Punjab  Local  Government  departments;  a \nmember  of  the  Provincial  Board  of  Revenue;  the  Director  General  of  Environment  Protection \nAgency  (EPA);  the  managing  director  of  PIDA;  representatives  of  the  concerned  district \ngovernments; two representatives of the civil society; and the project director who will also serve \nas secretary.  The PSC will meet as required but at least once every year to (i) review project \n\n                                                 \n12   Feasibility   studies,  detailed  design,  construction   and  engineering  supervision  of  the  water supplies  will  be               \n     undertaken by the firms engaged for the dam construction. \n13  Together with two accountants:  one accountant\u2019s assistant and one procurement assistant. \n14  To be recruited from the NGO selected under the Project to undertake the social mobilization consulting services. \n15  The agriculture  extension  advisor  is  to  be recruited  through  the  firm  recruited  under  the Project to undertake                              \n     agriculture extension services. \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n11\n\nprogress and (ii) act on any issues in need of resolution at the provincial level.  \n \n41. \nThree  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  PIPD  will  establish  a  subproject  selection  and \nplanning  committee  (SSPC)  to  monitor  and  advise  on  the  planning  process  and  to  address \nsubproject  selection  issues  at  identification,  pre-feasibility,  and  feasibility  screening  phases.  \nThe  SSPC  will  be  chaired  by  the  PIPD  Chief  Engineer  Development  Zone  (CEDZ)  with  the \nproject  director,  PMU  as  secretary-member.  The  members  will  comprise  the  SDO  project \ndirector; director,   Engineering Strategic Cell PIPD; director, Social and Environment Monitoring \nUnit; the DDPTM; one or more PMU project managers; and the concerned executive engineers. \nOn  the  basis  of  SSPC\u2019s  recommendation,  ADB  and  the  EA  will  give  the  final  approval  for  the \nsubprojects.16 \n \nFor  each  dam  construction-related  subproject,  PIPD  will  establish  a  subproject  design \n42. \nand  construction  committee  during  the  dam  design  and  construction  phases  to  (i)  ensure \neffective  coordination  between \nthe  social  mobilization,  construction,  and  resettlement \nprocesses;  (ii)  resolve  issues  arising  between  the  communities,  the  contractors,  and  other \nparties;  (iii) review  progress  against  the  target  and  report  difficulties  to  the  PMU  and  SDO \nproject directors; and (iv) inform district administration on progress made. The committee will be \nchaired by the SDO executive engineer and will comprise the subdivisional officer of the SDO \nas  secretary,  the  resident  engineer  of  the  engineering  design  and  supervision  consultants,  a \nrepresentative  of  the  affected  persons  (APs),  a  representative  of  the  social  mobilizers,  and  a \nrepresentative of the executive district office (EDO) in which the subproject is located. The chair \nwill determine and nominate any other members as necessary. \n \nUpon completion of dam construction, PIPD will establish a subproject development and \n43. \noperation committee to (i) ensure the effective coordination between the activities related to the \nsubprojects;  (ii)  resolve  issues  arising  between  communities,  project  teams,  contractors,  and \nother  parties;  (iii) review  progress  against  the  target;  and  (iv)  inform  district  administration  on \nprogress made. The committee will be chaired by one of the PMU managers and will consist of \nthe  social  mobilizer  as  secretary;  the  responsible  SDO  subdivisional  officer;  the  agriculture \nextension,  livestock  extension,  on-farm  water  management,  soil  conservation,  and  forest \ntechnical  officers  based  in  the  PMU  field  offices;  representative  of  the  farmers\u2019  organizations; \nand a representative of the EDO. The chair will determine and nominate any other members as \nnecessary  to  be  included  in  the  committee.  The  proposed  project  organization  structure  is \nshown in Appendix 5. \n \n\nSubproject Preparation and Selection \n\n2. \n \n44. \nSubproject  Preparation.  Each  subproject  involving  the  construction  of  a  dam  will  go \nthrough stepwise preparation that starts at identification and ends at the detailed design stage. \nScreening  will  take  place  at  the  end  of  the  identification,  pre-feasibility,  and  feasibility  stages. \nIdentification  and  pre-feasibility  studies  will  be  undertaken  by  SDO  with  the  support  of  the \nproject social mobilizers. The feasibility studies will be tendered to private contractors who will \nwork jointly with the social mobilizers. The studies will include technical and economic feasibility \nof  the  dam  and  associated  structures,  the  water  supplies,  the  watershed  development  plans \nincluding  a  geographic \nimpact \nassessments.  Social  mobilizers  will  (i)  provide  detailed  descriptions  of \nthe  potential \nbeneficiaries,  (ii)  verify  the  demand  expressed  by  the  communities  at  pre-feasibility  stage, \n(iii) survey land ownership in the future command areas, and (iv) assess issues of poverty and \n\ninformation  system  (GIS)  mapping  and  environmental \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB\u2019s approval will only be necessary for the first five subprojects of each category unless ADB is not satisfied with \n\nthe proposed selection process during the initial stage. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngender. A panel of experts will be mobilized to review the integrity and safety standards of the \ndam  designs  before  starting  the  detailed  design.  The  subproject  involving  only  rehabilitation \nand/or upgrading of the command area and main feeder canal will be selected out of the list of \nexisting dams provided by SDO. The proposed candidate subproject will go through a screening \nprocess. The social mobilizers will review (i) the social demand and (ii) the social organization \ncapacity of the water users. Dam sedimentation survey and safety inspection will be necessary \nto  determine  the  remaining  water  storage  capacity  and  the  safety  status  of  the  candidate \nsubproject. \n \n45. \nSelection Criteria. Selection criteria for subprojects involving construction of a dam are \naimed at selecting subprojects that are technically, economically, and environmentally feasible \nand have the best potential from the social point of view (demand-driven and equitable). Based \non  the  same  principles,  criteria  have  been  produced  for  the  selection  of  subprojects  involving \nthe rehabilitation and/or upgrading of the command area and main channels of an existing dam \nand  for  the  selection  of  water  supply.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  and  process  are \npresented in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n3.   \n\nSubproject Safeguard Plan Approvals  \n\n \n46. \nADB  does  not  have  a  formal  policy  on  environmental  categorization  of  dams  and \nreservoir  projects.  On  occasion,  environmental  category  A  has  been  assigned  to  reservoir \nprojects  that  have  involved  the  construction  of  a  dam  higher  than  15  m  or  with  a  reservoir \ncapacity greater than 3 million m3. This approach to categorization simply adopts a set of criteria \ndeveloped for technical design and dam safety requirements, but does not take environmental \nissues into account. Therefore the application of a set of triggers and thresholds developed for \ndam safety and technical design has a significant weakness in that it does not take into account \nthe  physical,  environmental,  and  social  effects  of  a  particular  project.  The  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  for  this  Project  has  been  developed  to  provide  a \nprocedure  that  focuses  on  the  physical,  environmental,  and  social  characteristics  of  each \nsubproject.  SEMU  in  PIPD  Lahore,  after  being  trained  by  an  international  environmental \nsafeguard  specialist,  will  undertake  environmental  categorization  of  the  subproject.  SDO  and \nthe  PMU  will  then  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nsafeguard  requirements  during  planning  and  construction.  A  more  detailed  description  of  the \nassessment process is in the EARP in Supplementary Appendix B.    \n \n47. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  and  implement  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans \n(LARPs)  via  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  section  (LARS)  where  personnel  seconded \nfrom  the  revenue  department  and  a  team  of  resettlement  specialists  are  located.  SDO  will \nsupport LARS by reviewing the alignments and supervising the cadastral survey of the affected \nland. LARPs will be submitted to ADB for clearance. The summary of the land acquisition and \nresettlement framework (LARF) is in Appendix 7. \n \n\nImplementation Plan  \n\n4.   \n \nTo  expedite  the  project  implementation  period,  the  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in \n48. \nbatches  equivalent  to  2,000  ha  of  irrigated  agriculture  development  (between  1  and  4 \nsubprojects).  There  will  be  a  total  of  four  batches  in  addition  to  the  core  subproject.    All \nsubprojects in each batch will be prepared simultaneously by SDO and the contract awarded by \nthe PMU to only two contractors. One contract will be awarded for implementing the feasibility \nstudy,  detailed  design,  and  construction  supervision,  and  another  one  will  be  awarded  for \nconstruction  of  the  dams,  the  main  channel,  and  the  water  supplies.    Implementation  of  both \ncontracts  will  be  supervised  by  SDO.  Watersheds  and  command  area-related  works  will  be \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n13\n\nProcurement \n\nImplementation Period \n\ntendered after organization of the farmer organizations and participatory planning. The PMU will \nprepare  the  technical  specification  and  award  the  works  to  ideally  one  single  contractor  per \nbatch.17  Contract  implementation  will be  supervised  by  the  PMU.  The  timing  between  batches \nwill  be  minimized.  As  soon  as  the  PMU  and  SDO  finishes  identification  and  the  pre-feasibility \nstudies for the first batch, preparation of the second batch will start. Preparation of the first batch \nwill start before loan effectiveness, and the social mobilizers will be recruited in advance through \nretroactive  financing  to  ensure  that  the  demand-driven  approach  is  carried  out.  The \nimplementation plan is in Appendix 9. \n \nH. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years  from  1  July  2008.  The \nestimated  project  completion  date  is  30  June  2014.  The  estimated  loan  closing  date  is  31 \nDecember  2014.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in  Appendix  8  and  a  detailed  schedule  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \nI. \n \n50. \nEquipment, materials, goods, and services for ADB-financed contracts will be procured \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  split  between  (i)  dam  and  associated  construction  works,  and  (ii)  command \narea  development  level  works.  For  each  subproject,  the  procurement  of  civil  works  worth \n$10 million  or  less  will  be  awarded  to  suitable  prequalified  contractors,  following  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  as  national  contracting  capacity  to \nsuccessfully  undertake  such  works  exists.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  more  than  $10  million \nwill  be  awarded  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  to  suitable  prequalified \ncontractors. All works contracts related to the first output will be handled by SDO on behalf of \nthe  PMU.  ADB  will  review  at  least  the  first  three  NCB  contracts  awarded.  Equipment  and \nmaterials  worth  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through  the  shopping  mode.  The  NCB \nprocedures will be conducted in accordance with the Government's Public Procurement Rules \n2004,  subject  to  the  clarification  of  the  rules  that  have  been  agreed  upon  with  ADB  for  the \npurpose  of  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  procurement  plan  (Appendix  10)  will  be \nupdated at least annually covering the next 18 months of procurement activity.  \n \nJ. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  651  person-months  of  national  and  46  person-months  of \n51. \ninternational  consulting  services  through  both  consulting  firms  and  individual  consultants.  All \nconsulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will provide 569 person-months \nof  national  project  implementation  consultants  (8  long-term  consultants)  for  the  PMU.  These \ninclude the project director;18 the head of monitoring and evaluation; the livestock advisor and \nfive \nfarming  systems,  watershed \nconservation,  finance,  water  supply  and  sanitation;  and  5  person-months  of  unallocated \nnational consulting services from individual consultants. The Project will also provide technical \nadvisory services (46 person-months  international  and 82 person-months national) comprising \na panel of experts of international experts in dam design and construction, engineering geology, \nand  hydrology;  and  a  pool  of  national  and  international  specialists  on  economics,  water \n                                                 \n17 Designing the watershed and command area works requires time for social mobilization and participatory planning \nand therefore cannot be packaged in the same package as the dam, appurtenant structures, and water supplies.  \n18 The project director is preferably to be provided by the Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD), but if no \n\nfor  on-farm  water  management, \n\nConsulting Services \n\ntechnical  managers \n\nsuitable candidates are available, the project director will be supplied from the open market. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmanagement,  dam  safety  inspection,  dam  sedimentation,  dam  operation,  irrigation  operation, \nenvironment  assessments,  and  resettlement.  For  these  advisory  services,  a  firm  will  be \nrecruited through the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method using the full technical \nproposal method. The  terms of reference are  in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n52. \nSocial  mobilization  will  be  provided  by    (i)  individual  consultants  during  the  project \nadvance  actions19  and  (ii)  a  qualified  local  NGO20  to  be  recruited  through  the  QCBS  method \nusing a full technical proposal. The terms of reference (TOR) are in Supplementary Appendix E. \nThe training and mentoring services on participatory extension  services (farmers field school) \nwill be provided by CABI21 using single source selection. Single source selection is  preferred for \nthe  following  reasons:  (i)  CABI  is  more  qualified  for  the  assignment  than  any  other  locally \nestablished  organization  due  to  its  unique  expertise  in  farmer  field  schools  in  Pakistan  and \ndemonstrated  good  track  record  in  delivering  that  service;22  (ii)  CABI  is  already  contracted  by \nPIPD for the 3-year pilot project to improve command area development on small dams and its \nrecruitment  in  the  Project  is  a  natural  continuation  of  this  pilot  experience;  and  (iii) the  project \nofficer  and  PIPD  could  not  identify  an  organization  that  would  be  similarly  qualified  for  the \nassignment.  \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n53. \nConsulting services will also be required to produce the subproject feasibility studies, the \nenvironment  impact  assessment  (EIA)  studies, detailed  designs,  and  construction supervision. \nThe TOR for these services will be developed by SDO with support from individual consultants \nrecruited  through  advance  contracting.  The  feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  work \nsupervision will be packaged in one single contract per subproject and consulting firms recruited \nthrough  the  QCBS  method.  The  EIA  will  be  undertaken  by  a  specialized  consulting  firm  to  be \nrecruited  through  the  consultant  qualification  selection  (CQS)  method.  In  both  cases,  if  the \nselected  firms  perform  well  on  their  first  contract,  their  services  will  be  used  in  the  next \nsubproject and their contract extended.    \n \nK. \n \n54. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nL. \n \n55. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of  the  loan  proceeds,  two \nimprest  accounts  (one  for  each  loan)  will  be  established  for  and  managed  by  the  PMU  in  the \nNational  Bank  of  Pakistan.  The  accounts  will  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n19 Estimated at 4 person-months of social mobilizer manager and 32 person-months of field social mobilizers. \n20 Estimated at 66 person-months of social mobilizer manager and 808 person-months of field social mobilizer. \n21 CABI is an international organization with 40 member countries, with its head office in Wallingford, United Kingdom. \n\nThe organization has offices in several ADB member countries including Pakistan. \n\n22 Particularly  for  the  Government-financed  Punjab  Fruit  and  Vegetable  Project  and  the  ADB-financed  Malakand \nRural Development Project.

Manila. \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n15\n\nRetroactive Financing and Advance Action \n\naccordance with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nThe  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  10%  of  the  total \nloan  amount  or  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  whichever  is  lower.  The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to \nliquidate and replenish the imprest accounts for individual payments under $100,000 equivalent. \nLoan disbursements for goods and services under major civil works and consultants contracts \nwill be made using direct payment methods as outlined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \nM. \n \n56. \nThe government of Punjab has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing \nunder the Project to allow for (i) the feasibility and detailed design studies, and (ii) environmental \nassessment  studies,  (iii)  the  numerical  modeling  study,  (iv)  the  recruitment  of  the  project \nimplementation consultants and NGO social mobilizers. Retroactive financing will take effect for \na period not to exceed 12 months from the date of the Loan Agreement. The Government has \nbeen informed that the amount of retroactive financing must not exceed 20% of the total ADB \nloan  amount,  and  that  approval  of  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  Furthermore,  the  Government  has  been  informed  that \ncompliance  with  ADB  procurement  and  consulting  services  guidelines  under  the  advance \nactions was required. \n \n57. \nUnder  the  supervision  of  PIPD,  SDO  will  be  responsible  for  contracting  and  financial \nmanagement  related  to  the  advance  action.  The  financial  management  capacity  of  SDO  was \nassessed  under  the  project  preparatory  TA23  through  a  financial  management  assessment \nquestionnaire.  The  result  indicated  a  moderate  risk  of  weakness  of  the  financial  management \nsystems. A consultant from an ongoing ADB TA will assist SDO during this interim phase.  \n \nN. \n \n58. \n The government of Punjab will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for \nfunds provided to the Project. These accounts and related financial statements will be audited \nannually by the auditor general of Pakistan, and will include an audit with a separate opinion on \nthe use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures procedures. The government of \nPunjab will furnish ADB with the audited accounts and statements not later than 6 months after \nthe  end  of  the  related  fiscal  year.  Through  the  PMU,  PIPD  will  submit  to  ADB  (i)  diagnostic \nquarterly reports detailing the project progress to date, (ii) problems encountered, (iii) measures \ntaken  to  overcome  them,  (iv)  expected  progress  over  the  next  quarter,  (v)  safeguards  and  \ncompliance with them, as well as (vi) any major or serious issues that need to be expeditiously \naddressed.  Three  months  before  project  completion,  PIPD  will  submit  a  project  completion \nreport to ADB detailing the utilization of the loan proceeds, project implementation analysis, and \nthe socioeconomic impact of the Project on the subproject beneficiaries. \n \nO. \n \nA project monitoring system will be established within 6 months of loan effectiveness. A \n59. \nspecific  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  unit  reporting  directly  to  the  project  director  will  be \ncreated in the PMU. It will be headed by a senior M&E specialist (economist) and staffed with \nthree  M&E  data  collectors  and  one  data  entry  operator.  Initial  support  from  an  international \nconsultant  will  be  provided  to  design  the  M&E  system  that  will  be  used  throughout  project \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2006.

This  will  involve  the  establishment  of  a  project  reporting  system  that  will \ngenerate  trimester  reports  on  project  implementation  progress.  At  the  beginning  of  the  project \nand not later than 12 months after loan effectiveness, specific indicators will be identified for the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project.  A  baseline  survey  will  be  carried  out  for  each \nsubproject before its commencement and at the end of its implementation. The M&E unit may \nimplement thematic evaluations if requested by the project director, PMU managers, or ADB. \n \nP. \n \n60. \nPIPD  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  project  review  semiannually  to  (i)  ensure  that  the \nimplementation arrangements are in place and appropriate, (ii) assess implementation progress \nand  identify  remedial  measures  to  address  bottlenecks,  and  (iii)  ensure  that  safeguards  and \nother  conditions  are  being  met.  Within  30  months  of  the  loan  Effectiveness  date,  a  midterm \nreview  will  be  undertaken.  It  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  project \nimplementation  arrangements  and  progress  to  date;  and  consultations  with  the  beneficiary \ncommunities, \nIf  necessary, \nline  agencies,  EPA,  NGOs,  and  district  authorities. \nrecommendations  will  be  made  for  adjustments  to  the  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and cost estimates.  \n   \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nA. \n \n61. \nThe  economic  benefits  from  subprojects  involving  the  construction  of  a  new  dam  will \ncome  essentially  from  increased  production  in  agriculture  and  livestock  due  to  the  shift  from \nrain-fed  to  irrigated  agriculture.  Irrigation  development  and  extension  services  will  support  a \nsubstantial increase in crop yields (more than 100% for main crops such as wheat, corn, gram, \nand groundnuts) and an increase in cropping intensities from an average 60% to at least 120%. \nIrrigation  will  stimulate  some  diversification  into  high-value  crops  such  as  vegetables  and \norchard fruits that can be sold to local markets. The substantial increase in crop residue and the \nincrease  in  fodder  production  will  support  a  25%  increase  in  livestock  numbers  as  well  as  an \naverage increase of 20% in production per animal. Benefits will also come from fish production \nin the dam reservoir and from the development of the water supply in the vicinity of the dam.  \n \n62. \nThe  main  impact  resulting  from  watershed  management  consists  of  reduced  sediment \ninflow  and  extended  life  of  the  dam.  It  will  also  yield  benefits  from  the  reduced  soil  erosion  in \nprivate  agricultural  fields,  production  of  fuel  wood  through  afforestation  of  the  main  erosion \nspots, and planting of drought-resistant fruit trees to retain soil on private farms. \n \n63. \nThe sum of all these benefits in the case of the Kot Fateh Khan core subproject yields an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 14.3%. The EIRR of the rural water supply alone is \n34% and contributes 1.5% to the overall EIRR  of the subproject (see summary economic and \nfinancial analysis in Appendix 11). \n \nBenefits  from  the  development  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  schemes  will  come  from \n64. \nincreased production in agriculture and livestock.  The economic viability of such activities will \nbenefit  from  the  sunk  costs  of  completed  dams.  Nevertheless,  where  facilities  are  being \nrehabilitated, the economic benefits will be lower than for new irrigation schemes since some of \nthe benefits will have been achieved even without the project interventions. However, the EIRR \nfor most extension and rehabilitation subprojects is expected to be greater than the EIRR for the \ncore subproject.  \n \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n17\n\nThe  Project  will  have  additional  benefits  that  have  not  been  translated  in  economic \n65. \nterms. They include (i) the role that the dam will play in reducing flood intensity and associated \ndamage,  (ii)  the  increased  capacity  of  IPD  and  SDO  for  dam  safety  and  sedimentation \nmonitoring as well as dam O&M, (iii) the recreational and environmental value of the dam site, \nand (iv) the increased availability and recharge of groundwater. Some subprojects will also have \nother benefits: (i) the provision of bulk water to urban centers or private housing developments, \n(ii) the generation of electricity, and (iii) the permanent release of water for downstream users \non streams that are not currently perennial.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1.  \n\nSocial Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n\n \n66. \nThe  Project  will  have  positive  poverty  reduction  impacts  on  the  income,  employment \nopportunities, and food security of people in barani areas. The estimated rise in income for the \nestimated  22,000  beneficiary  households  (176,000  persons)  will  vary  in  the  case  of  the  core \nsubproject  from  $147  to  $7,274  per  annum,  depending  on  land  tenure  and  farm  size.  The \nagricultural  intensification,  particularly  diversification  to  more  labor-intensive  higher-value \nirrigated  crops,  will  have  a  positive  indirect  impact  on  the  poorest  by  generating  job \nopportunities. In the project area, agricultural labor is usually provided by landless households \nand  represents  a  major  source  of  income  to  sustain  their  livelihood  and  eventually  meet  their \nneeds such as health care and education. The increase in water availability for domestic uses \nwill  benefit  an  estimated  9,050  rural  households  (72,400  persons).  Its  main  benefit  will  be  to \nreduce the time spent by women in collecting water and to improve health. Increased domestic \nwater availability will particularly benefit the poor who are the first to be affected by scarcity. \n \n67. \nThe  Project  will  result  in  decentralized  management  of  new  and  existing  irrigation \nsystems  and  in  the  establishment  of  farmer  organizations  with  full  financial  autonomy.  The \nformation of farmer organizations responsible for distribution and minor canals as well as better \ntrained  staff  will  lead  to  the  following:  (i)  greater  responsiveness  of  service  to  irrigation \ndemands,  (ii)  more  efficient  and  equitable  water  distribution,  (iii)  improved  accountability  and \ntransparency,  and  (iv)  improved  collection  of  the  water  fee,  allowing  higher  expenditures  on \nsystem O&M, thus improving the sustainability and performance of the systems.  \n \n68. \nprocess that will ensure all stakeholders are involved in decision making.  \n \n69. \nThe  Project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  includes  measures  to \nensure that the PMU staff is gender sensitive and the project activities create opportunities for \nwomen\u2019s development. \n \n70. \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  has  been  conducted  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001). A summary poverty reduction social \nstrategy for the Project is summarized in Appendix 12.  \n \n\nThe  participation  strategy  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  outlines  a  social  mobilization \n\n2.  \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n71. \nThe  following  types  of  assets  may  be  expected  to  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts  due  to  the  construction  of  the  dam  and  the  feeder  canal:  (i)  agricultural \nand nonagricultural land, much of which is privately owned and supports the livelihood of rural \nhouseholds;  (ii)  private  and  public  structures  and  utilities,  including,  among  others,  residential \nhouses,  fishponds,  wells,  water  supply  schemes,  roads  and  footpaths;  and  (iii)  livelihood \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthrough the loss of crops and trees, businesses and employment, and grazing resources. \n\n3.  \n\nIndigenous People \n\nEnvironmental Impact    \n\nNo  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  expected  because  the  districts  of  Attock, \n\n72. \nA LARP was prepared for the core subproject, which is typical of the largest subprojects \nthat can be developed under the Project. A total of 529.72 ha will be acquired, of which 45.56 ha \nis cultivable and 484.16 ha is uncultivable. The subproject will not cause physical displacement \nof houses. A total of 68 households (510 persons) will be affected by land losses. Of these, 3 \nhouseholds (28 persons) will lose 10% or more of their cultivable agricultural land but will not be \nseverely  affected  as  the  affected  land  generates  no  income.  The  subproject  was  classified  as \ncategory B only. The LARF and LARP are in supplementary Appendix H. \n  \n \n \n73. \nRawalpindi, Jhelum, and Chakwal have no indigenous people as defined by ADB.   \n \nC. \n \n74. \nThe Pothowar plateau is characterized by dry, sparsely vegetated landscapes with few, \nif  any,  natural  water  features.  The  extensive  clearing  of  the  land  for  fuel  wood  and  rain-fed \nagriculture  means  the  environmental  values  of  the  area  are  generally  low.  The  environmental \nassessment studies show that the Project will provide significant environmental benefits due to \nthe  presence  of  permanent  water  bodies  in  an  otherwise  dry  environment.  The  watershed \nmanagement  measures  will  increase  vegetative  cover  and  conserve  soils,  improving  the \ndiversity  of  habitats  and  the  landscape.  Any  negative  impacts  are  expected  to  be  temporary, \nmainly  associated  with  construction  work,  and  will  be  mitigated  through  the  effective \nimplementation of environmental management plans. The presence of a large body of water will \nalter the landscape and flood the existing river and gullies; however, these impacts are offset by \nthe  considerable  benefits  of  the  development  of  irrigated  agriculture.  The  Project  was \ncategorized as a category A sector loan under the ADB Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003).  A  sector  loan  EIA  has  been  prepared,  along  with  an  EIA  for  the  sample  subproject  at \nKot Fateh Khan that was circulated to the board and posted on the ADB website 120 days prior \nto board approval (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nD. \n \nCommitment  to  Decentralization  of  Irrigation  Schemes.  The  government  of  Punjab \n75. \nfarmer  organizations, \nhas  shown \ndevelopment  of  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Reform  Program  (PISRP),  and  active  support  for \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Development  Policy  Loan.  The  government  is \ncommitted to continue decentralized management, and  will benefit from the project assistance \nto extend decentralized management outside the Indus canal system. \n\nthrough  establishment  of \n\nits  commitment \n\nto  reform \n\nRisks  \n\n76. \nEffective  Farmer  Organizations  and  Participation.  The  participation  and  ownership \nproposed under the Project depend on the ability of the water users to (i) develop remunerative \nfarming systems, (ii) work in an inclusive manner on the water distribution system, and (iii) share \nthe  water  equitably  among  themselves.  To  have  genuine  participation,  the  elite  must  not  be \ndominant and women must be involved. The social mobilization teams, staffed with an adequate \ngender balance and trained by PIDA, will enable the Project to work with organized community \ngroups, maximize positive impact on women, and support the formation of legally autonomous \nfarmer organizations under the PIDA Act. \n \n77. \n\nDesign  Feature  and  Phasing.  The  demand-driven  and  integrated  approach  requires \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n19\n\ngood  coordination  between  the  different  activities  and  precise  phasing  of  the  subprojects  to \nensure  synergies  and  avoid  implementation  delays.  This  condition  will  be  ensured  by \n(i) providing  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  experts  under  the  EA  single  line  of  command  to  avoid \ninteragency coordination problems, and (ii) implementing the Project in batches of four sites to \nbe able to reduce procurement delays and facilitate contract management.  \n \n78. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  Effective  implementation  of  environmental  management \nplans depends on regular independent monitoring of the works. This role is often undertaken by \nthe  relevant  environment  agency.  As  the  Punjab  Environment  Protection  Department  has \ninadequate  staff  and  money  and  is  unable  to  effectively  monitor  the  construction  of  the \nsubprojects, SEMU will undertake routine monitoring.  Effective controls will be ensured through \nconditions  in  the  contract  that  will  enable  the  PMU  to  issue  caution-and-stop-work  notices  to \ncontractors who underperform. \n \n79. \nPolitical  Instability.  Political  stability  in  Pakistan  has  deteriorated  recently  and  could \nfurther  deteriorate  with  the  election  process.  Nevertheless,  the  project  area  is  a  particularly \nstable area. It has not been affected by the current political turmoil and project implementation \nand monitoring are not jeopardized.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n \nA. \n \n80. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n81. \nProject  Management  Unit.  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  government  of \nPunjab will have appointed the project director, the PMU finance manager and the appropriate \nsupport  staff.  Within  5  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  government  of  Punjab  will  have  fully \nstaffed  the  PMU  and  ensure  that  the  unit  will  remain  fully  staffed  throughout  the  project \nimplementation period.  \n \nProject Steering Committee. Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the government of \n82. \nPunjab will have established the PSC and ensure that it remain fully operational throughout the \nproject implementation period. \n \nIncremental Staff.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the government of Punjab will \n83. \naugment  the  SDO  staffing  to  include  the  positions  of  deputy  director,  planning  and  technical \nmonitoring, and three social mobilizers. \n \nStandard  Operating  Procedures.  Within  24  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \n84. \ngovernment of Punjab will have developed and adopted operational guidelines on dams, which \nwill  specify  clearly  the  roles  and  duties  of  various  institutions  involved  in  operating  dams, \nincluding but not limited to SDO and farmer organizations.  \n \n85. \nFarmer  Organizations.  The  government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  the  establishment  of \nappropriate  arrangements,  as  stipulated  in  the  prevailing  government  laws,  rules,  and \nregulations,  for  proper  and  timely  registration  of  farmer  organizations  within  the  project  area. \nWithin  36  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  government  will  ensure  that  50%  of  the  farmer \norganizations  required  for  O&M  of  the  facilities  constructed  under  the  Project  have  been \nestablished.  To  ensure  proper  O&M  of  the  facilities,  the  government  will  allow  the  farmer \norganizations  within  the  project  area  to  retain  a  reasonable  portion  of  the  collected  abiana  or \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nirrigation water charge proceeds, the amount of which will be agreed upon by the government \nand ADB. \n \n86. \nDam Development Strategy. Prior to the completion of the Project, the government of \nPunjab  will  have  adopted  a  provincial  strategy  and  an  implementation  manual  for  dam \ndevelopment in Pothowar. \n \n87. \nDam  Safety  and  Sedimentation  Monitoring  Unit.  Prior  to  the  completion  of  the \nProject,  the  government  of  Punjab  will  have  established  a  dam  safety  and  sedimentation \nmonitoring unit that will undertake regular dam safety inspections and sediment surveys.  \n \n88. \nDam  Construction.  The  government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that  during  project \nimplementation, any construction of dams within the project area which is outside the scope of \nthe  Project  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and  approach  adopted  under  the \nProject. In addition, the government will ensure that in the construction of these dams, additional \nresources will be provided to the relevant implementing agencies to avoid delay in implementing \nthe Project.   \n \n89. \nCounterpart Funds. The Government will, and will cause the government of Punjab to \nensure  that  the  required  counterpart  funds  are  made,  approved,  and  released  in  a  timely \nmanner to ensure proper implementation of the Project.  \n \n90. \nBudgetary  Allocations.  The  government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that  appropriate \nallocation  will  be  made  in  its  annual  budget  to  ensure  proper  O&M  of  the  dams  and  the  main \nchannel carrier. \n \n91. \nBidding Documents. The government of Punjab will ensure that the bidding documents \nand contracts for civil works under the Project will include provisions that require (i) prompt and \nequal pay to men and women for work of equivalent value; (ii) safe working conditions for all the \nworkers;  and  (iii)  compliance  with  national  laws  and  international  treaty  obligations  in  the \nemployment  of  child  labor  (child  labor  will  not  be  used  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance \nactivities). The PMU will monitor compliance and report on the implementation of these activities \nin its regular progress reports. \n \n92. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Government  will,  and  will  cause  the \ngovernment  of  Punjab  to  ensure  that  all  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  under  the \nsubprojects shall be done in accordance with (i) the LARF agreed upon by the Government and \nADB;  (ii)  the  relevant  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  of  the  Federal  and  Punjab \ngovernments;  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  government  will \nfurther  agree  that  for  a  particular  subproject,  no  withdrawals  from  the  works  expenditure \ncategory  will  be  made  until  all  persons  affected  by  the  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement activities under the subproject have been adequately compensated in accordance \nwith the LARF and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.  \n \nEnvironment. The Government will, and will cause the government of Punjab to ensure \n93. \nthat the design, construction, O&M of all the subprojects\u2019 facilities are carried out in accordance \n(i)  with  the  agreed-upon  EARP,  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002), and  (iii)  the  federal  and \nprovincial  regulations  on  the  environment.  The  government    of  Punjab  will  require  that  (i) the \nrelevant contractor under the Project will prepare an environmental management plan (EMP) for \neach  subproject  to  minimize  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  construction  for \nthe subproject; (ii) prior to the release of the land for the subproject, the contractor\u2019s EMP will \nhave  been  approved  by  SEMU;  and  (iii)  the  relevant  contractor  will  appoint  an  environment \n\n\f       \n\n  \n\n21\n\nmanager  with  qualifications  in  environmental  science  or  management  to  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  the  EMP.  The  government  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement  of  the  subproject  once  the  subproject  becomes  operational.

Pakistan  is  noteworthy  for  its  significant \n1. \ndevelopment  of  water  resources,  in  particular  the  Indus  River  irrigation  system,  the  largest \ncontiguous  irrigation  system  in  the  world.  The  system  supplies  irrigation  water  to  over \n14.9 million  hectares  (ha)  and  has  permanently  transformed  agriculture  and  the  livelihood  of \ntens  of  millions  of  Pakistanis  for  the  better.  In  Punjab,  8.4  million  ha  is  irrigated  by  the  Indus \nRiver system and irrigated agriculture (i) accounts for 28% of Punjab\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP) output, (ii) employs 54% of the labor force, (iii) produces 90% of agricultural output, and \n(iv) uses over 95% of the water resources. Punjab provides about 58% of the national GDP, and \n66% of the national agricultural GDP. However, about one quarter of Pakistan\u2019s cultivable area \nremains outside this system and suffers from chronically low agricultural productivity. In Punjab, \nabout 19% of cultivable lands lie in barani1 areas, mainly in the Pothowar plateau between the \nIndus and Jhelum rivers. The plateau covers an area of 2.2 million ha, of which 1.0 million ha is \nunder  rain-fed  agriculture.  Around  2,600  villages  have  a  population  of  4.2 million,  and  these \npeople generally have far more limited opportunities for productive agriculture and the livelihood \nit supports than farmers in the irrigated areas. \n \nBarani  Agriculture.  Agriculture  and  livestock  have  been  the  traditional  sources  of \n2. \nrevenue  for  people  in  barani  areas,  and  still  account  for  40%  of  their  income  in  Punjab. \nImprovement  in  livelihood  for  barani  residents,  especially  for  a  large  majority  of  small \nlandholders  and  tenants,  will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  gains  in  agriculture  and  livestock \nproductivity and growth in the local nonfarm sector. Improvement in both on-farm and nonfarm \nsectors  is  constrained  by  several  factors  common  to  rural  areas  of  Pakistan.  Among  the \nconstraints  are  (i)  impeded  access  to  markets,  inputs,  and  services  due  to  inadequate  or \nnonexistent  transportation  infrastructure;  (ii)  lack  of  access  to  electricity,  with  negative \nconsequences  for  the  productive  potential  of  both  the  agriculture  and  nonfarm  sectors;  (iii) \nproductivity  constraints  arising  from  the  lack  of  access  to  and  inadequate  social  services;  (iv) \nlack of access to finance and business development services; and (v) poor access to agriculture \nand livestock advisory and support services. The Government with external support is currently \nthose \ngiving  considerable  emphasis  and  committing  significant  resources \nconstraints. \n \n3. \nThe constraint that most significantly affects barani areas and agricultural and livestock \nproductivity is shortage of water. With no or limited secure water sources, farming  depends on \nrainfall, which is irregular in both annual and seasonal amounts as well as intensity in any given \nstorm event. Farmers have developed farming systems with very low input requirements to keep \nthe  financial  risk  of  crop  failures  manageable.  This  practice  results  in  low  productivity.  The \nprimary  crops  grown  and  their  average  yields  are  wheat  (0.5  tons/ha  [t/ha]),  maize  (0.7  t/ha), \nand  groundnuts  (0.4  t/ha).  In  contrast,  irrigated  yields  are  as  follows:  wheat  (3.1  t/ha),  maize \n(1.7 t/ha), and groundnuts (1.5 t/ha). In addition to lower average yields, barani areas are highly \nsusceptible to prolonged drought and associated poverty shocks due to the absence of reliable \nsurface or ground water sources. The most recent 2001\u20132003 drought had a devastating effect, \nespecially on the more arid parts of barani areas, and forced many families to migrate to urban \nareas, sell off productive assets, and face serious indebtedness.  \n\nto  address \n\n                                                 \n1  Barani  traditionally  refers  to  rain-fed  agriculture.  However,  the  percentages  given  here  cover  also  pockets  of \nirrigated agriculture developed out of limited sources of water. The Project will focus on areas dependent on rain-\nfed agriculture. \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 2        \n\n27\n\nSmall Dams  \n\nThe  scarcity  of  reliable  perennial  water  sources,  including  groundwater,  also  poses \n4. \nserious challenges to the provision of municipal water to the quickly growing rural communities \nand  small  towns  in  barani  areas.  It  constitutes  a  serious  impediment  to  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of local industrial and service activities, and represents a tremendous burden and \nloss of productive potential on families, mainly women, who may spend hours collecting water \non a daily basis. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nSmall  Dams  in  Punjab.  In  response  to  the  chronic  need  for  reliable  water  supply  and \ndevelopment in barani areas, the Government of Pakistan started a program to construct small \ndams  in  1961.  The  federal  Government  established  the  Agricultural  Development  Corporation \n(ADC),  which  constructed  10  dams.  The  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA) \nconstructed the Rawal dam in 1962. Following the ADC program, the Small Dams Organization \n(SDO)  was  established  in  1973  in  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD).  SDO \nassumed  control  of  the  ADC  and  WAPDA  dams.  In  addition  to  constructing  small  dams  with \ngovernment funds, ADB approved the Small Dams Project2 that supported the development of \nsmall  dams  (1986\u20131995)  along  with  measures  for  command  area  development,  fisheries \ndevelopment,  and  institutional  strengthening.  Development  of  small  dams  is  part  of  Pakistan \nand  Punjab\u2019s  overall  water  resources  development  strategy  and  is  reflected  as  an  investment \npriority in both the 2003 Ministry of Water and Power\u2019s Water Sector Strategy3 and the Federal \nPlanning  Commission\u2019s  2005  Medium-Term  Development  Framework.  In  the  2007\u20132010 \nmedium-term  investment,  the  government  of  Punjab  included  a  new  budget  allocation  of  $83 \nmillion for the development of new dam projects in the Pothowar plateau. \n \n6. \nTo date, 50 small dams have been commissioned in Punjab with a total canal command \narea of around 24,500 ha. SDO is headed by a project director (equivalent to a superintending \nengineer) and consists of three divisions based on geographic distribution: Islamabad, Chakwal, \nand  Jhelum.  Each  division  is  headed  by  an  executive  engineer  and  three  to  four  assistant \nengineers. In addition, SDO has a design section located at the SDO office in Islamabad, which \nis  headed  by  an  executive  engineer,  but  its  functions  are  carried  out  by  a  full-time  assistant \nengineer.  At  each  small  dam  location  in  Punjab,  there  is  a  permanent  staff  including  a  gauge \nreader  and  three  to  four  low-level  maintenance  personnel.  Although  SDO  has  the  technical \ncapacity  to  have  already  constructed  numerous  small  dams  and  conduct  prefeasibility  and \nfeasibility studies for additional small dams, the performance and development impact of small \ndams in Pakistan and in Punjab have not achieved their full potential. \n \n7. \nPoor Performance of Small Dams. The performance of small dams and adoption of \nirrigated agriculture in the small dam command areas have been limited primarily because of \n(i)  the  lack  of  a  fully  integrated  approach  incorporating  effective  command  area  development \nand  watershed  management,  (ii)  little  effective  participation  by  the  communities  in  project \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  1985.

The term \u201csmall dams\u201d used in this context relates to projects undertaken by \nthe Small Dams Organization of Punjab that generally range from 15 to 30 meters (m) high. More recently, projects \nin the order of 50 m have been constructed. The Project will follow the convention of the International Commission \non Large Dams (ICOLD) and the World Bank, in which large dams are defined as those higher than 15 m or with \nstorage capacity greater than 3 million cubic meters. \n\n3  This  was  supported  by  ADB.  1998.

The agricultural benefits anticipated to be generated \nby small dams have not materialized due to both the failure to adequately prepare the irrigation \ndistribution system in the command area, but, more importantly, the failure to prepare farmers \nto  take  full  advantage  of  the  new  water  supply.  In  general,  SDO  puts  much  of  its  technical \nemphasis on construction of the larger structures, the dam and feeder canal to the command \narea.  In  the  development  of  most  dams,  the  distribution  network  has  received  limited  or  no \ndevelopment.  Given  the  small  size  of  the  distribution  systems  and  the  proximity  of  the  water \nsupply, improved design and operating procedures that are more demand-responsive may be \npossible and could improve yields as well as increase water use efficiency.  \n \n9. \nWatercourse development below the mogha (outlet) is left to the discretion of farmers \nsince  this  activity  traditionally  falls  under  the  purview  of  the  Directorate  of  Command  Area \nDevelopment (DCAD) within the Department of Agriculture. In the larger Indus River irrigation \nsystems, DCAD is generally quite active and engaged; however, it is generally not involved in \nthe  development  of  small  dams,  and  watercourse  and  field  channels  are  inadequately \ndeveloped.4 This presents a significant problem since due to the small size of the small dam \nirrigation systems, watercourses and field channels are often the primary distribution features \nof  their  command  areas.  In  addition,  adequate  land  preparation  for  irrigation  is  generally \nabsent, and small dam command areas are often in undulating terrain. Another reason for slow \ndevelopment  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  small  dams  is  that  farmers  do  not  generally  practice \nwarabandi  (rotating  water  distribution  at  the  field  level  where  farmers  are  allocated  specific \ntime duration for drawing irrigation water for their fields). The warabandi turn is essentially the \nfarmer\u2019s  water  entitlement  as  specified  in  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Act  of  1873, \nwhich is still the overarching policy document for irrigation in Punjab. The lack of rotation and \nthe  resulting  often  inequitable  distribution  may  be  due  to  inadequate  attention  given  to \nwarabandi development during construction of the dam or due to weak institutions for irrigation \nmanagement  with  no  irrigation  rules  for  O&M  that  could  be  followed.  The  above  factors, \ncombined  with  the  reality  that  most  farmers  have  no  history  of  managing  irrigation,  warrant \nconsiderably  more  resources  to  be  devoted  to  effective  system  design,  and  farmer  guidance \nand  capacity  development  with  regard  to  watercourses,  field  channels,  and  on-farm  water \nmanagement activities. \n \n10. \nAgricultural  Constraints.  In  addition  to  water  management  and  land  preparation \nconstraints, the  development  of  the  command  area  of  small  dams  has  not  effectively  involved \nhuman resources or provided support for farmers who are supposed to make the transition from \nbarani to irrigated agriculture. Barani farmers have had success in cultivation despite substantial \nbarriers and exposure to risks; however, they need assistance in adapting to new higher-value \nor  more  intensive  cropping  patterns  that  are  appropriate  for  their  soil  and  climatic  conditions. \nOrchard,  vegetable,  and  other  crops  that  were  not  feasible  under  barani  conditions  can \nsignificantly  improve  farmer  livelihood,  but  farmers  must  have  the  capacity  and  confidence  to \ngrow  such  crops.  Improved  water  supply  may  necessitate  changes  to  existing  cropping \npractices  such  as  rotation  to  maximize  yield  gains.  Due  to  the  unreliability  of  water  supply, \nbarani  farmers  are  often  reluctant  to  risk  significant  investment  in  inputs;  with  improved  water \nsupply,  they  often  need  guidance  in  developing  the  most  productive  input  regime.  Changed \ncropping  and  agricultural  practices  may  also  require  new  and  unfamiliar  post-harvest \n\n                                                 \n4 The federal Government is funding a special initiative for lining the watercourses, and to date, none of these funds \n\nhave been channeled to development of the command area of small dams.  \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 2        \n\n29\n\ntechniques.  New  crops  may  require  new  marketing  channels  and  offer  new  value-added \nactivities  for  farm  communities,  but  assistance  is  needed  to  fully  exploit  these  opportunities. \nIncreased  production  intensity  can  also  create  employment  opportunities  and  allow  for  fuller \nemployment of landless laborers. \n \n11. \nDue  to  the  unreliability  of  farming  in  barani  areas,  livestock  plays  a  vital  role  in  the \nproductivity, livelihood, and wealth maintenance of barani communities and accounts for nearly \none  third  of  the  average  household  income.  Irrigation  from  small  dams  can  increase  fodder \nyields  and  correspondingly  significantly  increase  livestock  production.  Increased  production  of \nmilk  and  meat  will  result  in  livelihood  and  nutritional  benefits  to  barani  communities.  Farmers \nmay require assistance in adapting to more stall- and fodder- versus range-oriented production \nand  to  greater  intensification.  The  Directorate  of  Agricultural  Extension  and  the  Directorate  of \nLivestock  in  the  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA)  is  responsible  for  agricultural  extension \nactivities;  however,  extension  activities  to  farmers  in  the  command  area  of  small  dams  have \nbeen  limited  and  DA  capacity  is  generally  weak.  Support  to  farmers  for  improved  livestock \nproductivity is needed if small dams are to achieve their full potential. \n \n12. \nPIPD has recognized that, for small dams to achieve their full potential, more effective \ncommand  area  development  needs  to  be  put  in  place.  In  2005,  PIPD  initiated  the  pilot \nproject\u2014Command  Area  Development  of  Small  Dams  in  Rawalpinidi  Division.  This  project \ncovers  the  command  area  of  four  existing  small  dams  and  provides  funds  for  agricultural \nextension,  research,  and  the  formation  of  village  organizations  for  farmer  support.  The \napproach  of  the  program  recognizes  that  it  is  vital  to  work  in  partnership  with  communities  if \nfarming practices are to change; ideally, however, strong community participation must start at \nthe very beginning and continue throughout the dam development process so as to generate \nownership and expedite productivity gains. The PIPD program primarily focuses on agricultural \nsupport  services,  SDO  is  supposed  to  repair  the  irrigation  system  and  strengthen  warabandi \npractices in the dams, yet their capacity and incentives to do that are limited. In addition, this \npilot  project  does  not  form  farmer  organizations  for  ongoing  management  and  O&M  of  the \ncommand area. While initial results have been positive, the approach still needs to be reflected \nin  general  policy  and  mainstreamed  into  regular  practice  for  the  development  of  small  dams \nunder SDO.  \n \n13.  Watershed Management Constraints. Watershed management is critical to sustain the \nbenefits from the development of small storages. Sedimentation surveys of sample dams in the \nPothowar  region  reveal  that  loss  in  water  storage  capacity  can  be  as  high  as  4.2%  per  year, \nwhich  could  lead  to  full  siltation  of  the  dam\u2019s  dead  storage  only  after  24  years.  Empirical \nevidence also demonstrates that a few dams are likely suffering from higher sedimentation rate. \nThe  impact  that  this  premature  loss  of  effective  storage  would  have  on  the  dams\u2019  beneficiary \ncommunities,  even  beyond  the  dams\u2019  economic  life,  needs  attention.  In  particular,  an \nassessment of the watershed condition and any needed management plan should be studied at \nthe  feasibility  stage  and  monitoring  and  control  of  erosion  in  the  dam  watershed  must  be \nensured after dam construction. In recent small dam development projects undertaken by PIPD, \nwatershed management components have been included to address the issue of sedimentation. \nAlthough  long-term  studies  have  not  yet  been  possible,  the  initial  results  of  watershed \nmanagement  activities  on  small  dams  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  the  approach  and  its \nintegration into the development of small dams.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \n\nFarmer Organizations and System Management. Strengthening the management and  \n\nThe Institutional Framework  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nO&M of small dam command areas is required to improve system performance and productivity, \nyet to date little has taken place to organize farmers for more effective management. The need \nto  improve  management  accountability  and  O&M  affects  not  only  small  dams  but  all  irrigated \nareas  in  Punjab.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Authority  (PIDA)  Act  (1997)  and  the \naccompanying  farmer  organization  rules  and  regulations  of  1999  provide  an  institutional \nframework to create farmer organizations. The PIDA Act and its associated farmer organization \nrules  were  mainly  intended  to  empower  farmers  at  the  minor  and  distributary  canal  level  to \nmanage the large Indus River irrigation system. \n \n15. \nAfter  the  promulgation  of  the  PIDA  Act,  reform  efforts  languished  and  few  farmer \norganizations  were  formed;  however,  PIPD  has  made  substantial  progress  in  mobilizing  and \nestablishing over 100 farmer organizations during the last 3 years.5 In late 2005, PIPD initiated \nthe Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program (PISRP) with the assistance of the World Bank\u2019s \nPunjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy loan that lays a comprehensive reform program for \nirrigation  service  delivery  within  the  Indus  irrigation  system.  Although  the  PISRP  or  PIDA  Act \nexplicitly  addresses  small  dams  as  a  priority  issue,  the  PIDA  rules  state  that  \u201ca  farmer \norganization  may  be  formed  at  a  distributary  or  dam.\u201d  Specifically,  farmer  organization \nresponsibilities include (i) managing and O&M of the irrigation system (specific canals) for which \nit has been established, (ii) receiving bulk water from PIPD, (iii) ensuring equitable and efficient \nirrigation  supply,  (iv)  assessing  and  collecting  water  rates,  and  (v)  resolving  disputes.  The \nfarmer  organization  is  expected  to  become  a  self-supporting  and  self-sustaining  entity, \nespecially  with  regard  to  the  recovery  of  the  O&M  cost.  To  date,  the  experience  with  farmer \norganizations in the larger systems in Punjab has been positive. However, the relatively small \nand  self-contained  nature  of  the  dam  command  areas  and  communities  provides  conditions \nconducive to effective farmer organizations in these areas. \n \n16. \nEach  small  dam  developed  by  SDO  has  O&M  guidelines  and  estimated  O&M  costs \nprepared  as  part  of  its  development.  In  many  of  the  systems  under  SDO,  O&M  and  O&M \nresources have been inadequate, yet farmers have never been given responsibility or resources \nfor  system  O&M  or  management.  This  situation  has  led  to  substantial  deferred  maintenance, \nwhich,  combined  with  initially  poor  command  area  development,  has  resulted  in  severely \ndegraded physical conditions of many small dam irrigation systems. System losses in many of \nthe irrigation command areas of small dams are as high as 50%, which significantly affects tail-\nend  farmers  of  the  canal  network.  Given  the  small  area  and  the  relatively  simple  irrigation \ninfrastructure, farmer organizations with adequate resources should be able to provide a more \neffective arrangement to manage systems and execute O&M. \n \n17. \nThe  PIDA  Act  provides  a  legal  framework  for  organizing  farmers  for  irrigation \nmanagement  in  small  dams,  yet  SDO  has  not  yet  undertaken  this  provision  of  the  PIDA  Act. \nFarmer organizations within the command area of a small dam may provide a more natural unit \nfor organization and cooperation than in a network of interconnected canals that may be several \nhundred  thousand  hectares.  Due  to  the  isolated  nature  of  small  dams  spread  throughout \nPothowar,  farmer  organizations  in  small  dam  areas  may  be  able  to  play  a  broader  role  than \nwater  management  and  O&M  alone  to  help  address  some  of  the  agricultural  productivity \nconstraints concerning inputs, production, and marketing. This role would be similar to the one \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nIslamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program.  Manila  (Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility,  Loan  2300-PAK).  This  Project  will  support  establishment  of  farmer  organizations  over  about \n25% of the entire irrigated area of Punjab. \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 2        \n\n31\n\nbeing  played  by  the  village  organization  being  formed  under  PIPD\u2019s  pilot  project\u2014Command \nArea Development of Small Dams\u2014in Rawalpindi division. \n \n18.  Multipurpose  Water  Use  of  Dam  Water.  In  Punjab,  16  of  the  50  existing  small  dams \nprovide  municipal  water  supply  for  local  villages  and  towns  in  the  area  in  addition  to  irrigation \nwater,  which  in  barani  areas  is  an  especially  valuable  use  of  the  resource.  Given  Pakistan\u2019s \nburgeoning  population,  the  need  for  reliable  potable  water  is  growing.  As  a  result,  this  water \nsupply  function  has  become  significant.  Nine  of  the  20  dams  built  between  2003  and  2008 \nprovide municipal water supply in addition to irrigation, compared with only 7 of 30 dams built \nbefore  that date.6  However,  SDO  institutionally gives  priority  to  agriculture  development  rather \nthan the domestic water supply as the latter mandate belongs to the tehsil municipality agencies \n(TMAs).  PIPD  acknowledges  the  need  to  articulate  policies  for  entitlement,  management,  and \npricing  of  dam  water  resources  to  ensure  equitable  access  for  the  various  interested  user \ngroups. \n \n19. \nCurrently,  entitlements  for  various  uses  of  dam  water  are  specified  in  a  volumetric \nmanner  by  SDO  during  development  of  the  dam  project.  These  quantities  and  any  temporal \nconditions to deliver the water are enumerated in the project\u2019s PC I7 that is submitted by SDO \nthrough  PIPD  to  the  Punjab  Planning  and  Development  Board  for  approval.  For  smaller \nprojects,  the  PC  I  is  approved  at  the  provincial  level,  but  for  larger  projects  or  projects  with \nforeign  funding,  the  PC  I  is  approved  at  both  the  provincial  and  federal  levels.  Therefore,  the \napproved  PC  I  serves  as  the  formal  entitlement  for  water  that  is  to  be  supplied  to  a  village or \ntown. Changes to water allocations for various uses in a small dam are also permitted in Punjab \nthrough a petition from PIPD that needs to be approved by the chief minister\u2019s office.8 While this \nis not a formal entitlement system, it provides a binding agreement with due process for water \nallocation and reallocation in small dams. \n \n20. \nDam  Safety.  Although  the  safety  record  for  dam  safety  in  Pothowar  is  excellent, \ncurrently  no  agency  is  active  and  responsible  for  dam  safety  and  provides  regular  inspection \nand  technical  advice  to  SDO.  WAPDA  used  to  fill  this  role;  however,  inspections  stopped  for \nsmall dams in Pothowar in 2003. Dam inspection represents a larger problem in Pakistan that is \nbeing addressed under the Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP). MOWP is currently proposing \nmeasures for an improved dam safety framework and procedures at the federal level. PIPD has \nalso called for a dam safety unit that would be responsible for inspecting dams under SDO as \nwell as other larger PIPD infrastructure. Currently, there is a recognized problem that is being \naddressed\u2015regular monitoring, inspection, and technical advice for dam safety\u2015which is also \nnot in compliance with recommended practices of the international commission on large dams \n(ICOLD) of which Pakistan is a member. \n \n21. \nSupply-Driven  Planning.  The  construction  of  most  of  the  small  dams  today  has \nfollowed  a  supply-driven  approach.  During  planning  and  implementation,  the  SDO  proceeds \nprimarily  on  the  basis  of  technical  feasibility  and  does  not  consult  or  include  the  proposed \nbeneficiaries  or  would-be-negatively-affected  persons  in  identifying  prospective  projects.  The \nfirst formal interaction between SDO and persons in the dam\u2019s location often begins with legal \nnotices for land acquisition. Dam sites are usually identified through reconnaissance exercises \n\n                                                 \n6  Water allocation for water supply represents between 2.3% and 20.9% of the dams\u2019 live storage.  \n7 The PC I (planning commission pro-forma I) is the internal Government of Pakistan planning and budget allocation \ndocument  that  is  prepared  by  the  project  proponent,  in  this  case  PIPD.  PC  I  is  reviewed  on  the  basis  of  various \nparameters including social, environmental, and economic criteria. \n\n8  This has recently taken place in a situation where SDO is raising the height of a dam to provide more water to a \n\nlocal town that will be paying for the cost of raising the height of the dam.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nconducted  by  area  SDO  staff  that  give  cursory  consideration  to  hydrology,  watershed,  and \ngeology  and  focus  mainly  on  the  availability  of  geographic  features  where  a  dam  or \nembankment can be placed. To date, the demand and interest of future beneficiaries have not \ngenerally been factored into the decision to build a dam. Agency staffs generally do not consult \nwith  the  community  at  large  since,  by  some  accounts,  they  perceive  consultation  to  be \npotentially  disruptive  of  the  construction  process.  These  attitudes  and  procedures  have  led  to \nthe selection of dam sites where the bulk of the future beneficiaries may have limited interest in \ndeveloping  irrigation  and  undertaking  the  transition  to  irrigated  agriculture.  Even  if  the \ncommunities have interest in the development of the dam, they have little ownership and trust in \nthe  project  and  may  be  cautious  in  developing  the  command  area.  As  a  result,  the \nmaterialization of project benefits may be seriously delayed.  \n \nDam Operation. Operation of the dams\u2019 reservoirs has also generally been undertaken \n22. \nby SDO according to prescribed rules developed at the beginning of the project. Unlike larger \ncommand  areas  of  the  Indus  Basin  system  far  from  their  source,  the  command  area  of  small \ndams  are  close  to  the  water  supply  and  can  allow  for  more  flexible  and  responsive  reservoir \noperation  based  on  farmers\u2019  real-time  needs  for  irrigation.  However,  farmers  in  the  command \narea have little interaction or modalities to communicate their irrigation needs for more effective \nirrigation.  Decentralization  of  irrigation  management  in  the  case  of  small  dams  provides  the \nopportunity  for  greater  farmer  involvement  in  the  reservoir  operation  that  can  be  facilitated \nthrough  the  formation  of  farmer  organizations.  The  participation  of  farmers  can  improve  (i) \nscheduling  to  meet  farmers\u2019  needs,  (ii)  transparency,  (iii)  equity  of  water  allocation,  (iv) \nefficiency of water use, and (v) agricultural productivity. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f     Appendix 3     33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n\nTable A3.1: ADB Lending to Water Sector \n\n \n\n \n\nLoan No. \n\n2300-PAK \n\n800-PAK \n1679-PAK \n1578-PAK \n874-PAK \n1413-PAK \n837-PAK \n1297-PAK \n1294-PAK \n901-PAK \n\n \n\nProject \n\nPunjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program\u2014Punjab Irrigated \nProject Preparation Facility  \nPunjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nPunjab Farmer-Managed Irrigation \nSecond Flood Protection (Sector) \nKorangi Wastewater Management \nNational Drainage (Sector) \nPunjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (Sector) \nThird Punjab On-Farm Water Management \nPehur High-Level Canal \nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation \n\nTotal \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\nDate Approved \n\n900.0 \n\n13 Dec 2006\n\n50.0  \n7.8 \n100.0 \n70.0  \n140.0 \n46.0  \n62.1 \n127.6 \n72.0  \n1,575.5  \n\n28 Nov 2002\n25 Mar 1999\n13 Nov 1997\n18 Sep 1997\n12 Dec 1995\n31 Jan 1995\n8 Mar 1994\n22 Dec 1993\n4 Nov 1993\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PAK = Pakistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nTable A3.2: Other Agency Lending to Water Sector \n \n\nProject \n\nInstitution \n\nDate Approved \n\nPunjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan \nSindh On-Farm Water Management Project \nAJK Community Infrastructure \nNWFP On-Farm Water Management Project \nBiodiversity Conservation Project \nDrought  Eradication and Relief Program \nNational Drainage Program Project \nPunjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project \nPunjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project \n2nd Karachi Water Supply \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n100.0 \n61.1 \n20.0 \n21.4 \n10.1 \n7.8 \n285.0 \n56.0 \n56.0 \n91.9 \n709.3  \n\n1 Jun 2006\n20 May 2004\n9 Jul 2002\n12 Jun 2001\n24 Apr 2001\n1999\n4 Nov 1997\n1996\n11 Jul 1996\n9 Feb 1993\n\nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \n \n\nAJK = Azad Jammu and Kashmir, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province, WB = World Bank. \nSource: World Bank estimates. \n\n \n Table A3.3: ADB and Other Donors Lending to Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture  \nFederal and Punjab   \n\nLoan No. \n\nProject \n\nSustainable Livelihoods in Barani Areas Project (ADB) \nAgribusiness Development (ADB) \nStrengthening of Livestock Services  (EC) \n\n2134-PAK \n2171-PAK \n \n1877/1878/1879-PAK  Agriculture Sector Program II (ADB) \n1531-PAK \n1467-PAK \n\nDera Ghazi Khan Rural Development  (ADB) \nBahawalpur Rural Development Project  (ADB) \n\nTotal \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EC = European Commission, PAK = Pakistan.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\nDate Approved \n\n58.6 \n31.0 \n22.9 \n350.0 \n36.0 \n38.0 \n536.5 \n\n14 Dec 2004\n19 May 2005\n2003\n13 Dec 2001\n4 Sep 1997\n26 Sep 1996\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f34     Appendix 4 \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A4.1 Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\nTotal Cost \n($ million) \n\nPercentage of \nTotal Base \nCost \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

The community must be willing to (a) accept responsibility for \nO&M, and (b) pay for O&M requirements. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nWatershed Conservation \n\nSubproject Approval Process \n\n \n6. \nThe  implementation  of  watershed  conservation  measures  will  be  mandatory  for  any \nsubproject selected for dam construction and rehabilitation under the Project. No subproject will \nbe selected exclusively for watershed conservation activities. \n \nB.  \n \n7. \nPIPD  will  establish  a  subproject  selection  and  planning  committee  (SSPC)  within  3 \nmonths  of  the  loan  effectiveness  date,  to  monitor  and  advise  on  the  planning  process  and  to \naddress  subproject  selection  issues.    The  SSPC  will  be  chaired  by  the  PIPD  chief  engineer, \nDevelopment  Zone,  with  the  project  director  as  secretary.  The  members  will  comprise  the \nproject  director,  Small  Dams  Organization;  director,  Engineering  Strategic  Cell  PIPD;  director, \nSocial  and  Environment  Monitoring  Unit  (SEMU);  project  management  unit  project  managers; \nand the concerned executive engineers. Based on the recommendation of the SSPC, ADB and \nPIPD will make final approval of the subprojects. ADB\u2019s approval will only be necessary for the \nfirst  five  subprojects  of  each  category  unless  ADB  is  not  satisfied  with  the  proposed  selection \nprocess during the initial stage.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Letter of commitment signed by the majority of the future farmer organization members. \n\n\f                                                                                                                           Appendix 7        \n\n39\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND PLAN  \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan has requested a $75 million sector loan from the Asian \n1. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  undertake  the  Barani  Integrated  Water  Resources  Sector  Project. \nThe Project, with the Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD) as Executing Agency (EA), \nwill include several subprojects across the Pothowar plateau in Punjab involving the construction \nof  small  to  medium-sized  irrigation  reservoirs  and  ancillary  irrigation  canals  as  well  as  water \nsupplies,  watershed  conservation,  and  agricultural  extension  services.  The  construction  of  the \ndam and main channel will require land acquisition and may cause variable degrees of livelihood \nlosses due to reservoir impoundment and excavation and construction works. The land affected \nby  secondary  waterways  (watercourses)  will  be  provided  voluntarily  by  project  beneficiaries \nwhose  interest  in  the  Project  and  their  willingness  to  contribute  to  the  project  costs  would  have \nbeen  verified  during  the  planning  stage  as  part  of  the  demand-driven  approach  followed  by  the \nProject. Resettlement impacts are expected to be minimal as reservoirs will be built in the open \ncountryside  in  areas  far  from  settlements.  No  adverse  impacts  are  expected  to  be  caused  by \nwatershed  management  and  extension  services,  while  limited  impacts  might  be  associated  with \nthe provision of water supply systems and will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. No \nimpacts on indigenous peoples are expected as there are no indigenous people communities. in \nthe Project\u2019s targeted areas \n \n2. \nOne  core  subproject  has  been  fully  prepared.  Other  potential  subprojects  have  been \nidentified,  but  so  far  none  has  been  finally  selected  for  preparation  and  implementation.  This \nsummary  is  based  on  (i)  the  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  (ii)  the  core  subproject  feasibility \nstudy, and (iii)  the project land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF). \n \nB. \n \n3. \nProject land acquisition and resettlement (LAR), and income rehabilitation will be handled \nbased  on  Pakistani  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Operations \nManual  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Loan  appraisal  and  subproject  processing  will \nfollow the following social safeguards-related conditionalities. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLoan  appraisal:  (a)  preparation  of  a  LARF  valid  for  the  whole  loan,  and  (b) \npreparation  of  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  fitting  the \nappropriate level of impact severity1 for all core subprojects. \nApproval  of  subproject  contract  awards:  preparation  of  a  final  LARP  for  the \nrelevant subproject based on detailed design, and acceptable to ADB. \nSubproject  implementation:  completion  of  the  compensation  and/or  rehabilitation \nprogram detailed in the relevant subproject LARP in a way acceptable to ADB.  \n\n \n4. \nLARP for the only core subproject, namely the Kot Fateh Khan subproject.  \n\nTo satisfy the above requirements, the EA has prepared a LARF for the whole loan and a \n\n                                                 \n1  As noted in ADB Operations Manual Section F2/OP & BP (2006), a resettlement plan\u2019s complexity rests on impact \nseverity. If impacts are severe (>200 people resettled  or  with >10%  income losses),  a subproject is  classified  as \ncategory A and a full resettlement plan is prepared. If impacts are not severe (<200 people resettled or with <10% \nincome losses), a subproject is classified as category B and only a short plan is prepared. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nAgricultural \nland (property \nor use rights) \nincl. cultivable \nland (maira) \nand \nuncultivable \nland (Ghair \nMumkin) \n\nC. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF)  \n\n5. \nThe  LARF  principles  are  as  follows:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least  minimized;  (ii) \ncompensation will ensure maintenance of the affected people\u2019s (APs) pre-project living standards; \n(iii) the APs will be fully informed and consulted on compensation options; (iv) their socio-cultural \ninstitutions will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will equally apply to women and men; \n(vi) lack of a formal title will not be a bar to compensation or rehabilitation; (vii) special attention \nwill be paid to  female-headed households and to vulnerable groups; (viii) LAR will be planned and \nexecuted  as  an  integral  part  of  the  Project  and  costs  included  in  the  project  budgets;  (ix) \ncompensation will be fully provided prior to ground leveling and demolition; and (x) compensation \nfor  impacts  will  be  provided  at  full  replacement  cost  and  will  include  allowances  for  relocation \nand income restoration. \n \n6. \nwith ADB policy, and sets the eligibility and entitlement provisions listed in Table A7.1. \n \n\nThe LARF also covers all issues relevant for effectively implementing LAR in compliance \n\nTable A7.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nAssets Lost  Specification \n\nEligible AP  \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\nAll land losses \nirrespective of \nimpact severity \n\nOwner (titled and non-\ntitled) incl. individuals, \ngroups and communities \nwith common property \nresources  (shamilat) \n\nSharecrop tenant  \n\nLease tenant  \n\nPermanent: (i) Cash compensation for lost land at replacement \ncost based on market value + 15% compulsory land acquisition \nsurcharge free of taxes and transfer costs;

While land acquisition due \nto main canal and reservoir construction constitutes a negative impact affecting people that are \nnot necessarily project beneficiaries, land losses due to secondary watercourses construction in \nthe irrigation perimeter are directly related to a net benefit to landowners who have voluntarily \nelected  to  participate  in  the  irrigation  development  program.  As  part  of  the  demand-driven \napproach  developed  by  the  Project,  the  demand  of  the  potential  beneficiaries  is  assessed \nduring  the  dam  planning  stage  and  constitutes  a  criterion  for  selecting  a  given  dam  site.  This \ndemand is confirmed among others by the future beneficiaries\u2019 agreeing to contribute to the cost \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nof  the  land  leveling  and  the  watercourses.    For  this  reason,  the  main  canal  and  reservoir \nimpacts will be compensated in accordance with the above policy framework, but impacts of the \nsecondary  watercourses  will  not  be  compensated  and  land  will  be  acquired  as  a  voluntary \ncontribution.  It  is  to  be  noted  anyway  that  due  to  the  small  size  of  the  perimeters  (500\u20132,000 \nha), the secondary canals directly channeling the water from the main canal to the field are very \nsmall and technically simple enough to be dug by the users themselves.  This process will be \nundertaken by the beneficiaries themselves with support from the Project\u2019s social mobilizers. \n\nfor  each \n\nTo  verify  that  the  process  is  fair  and  supported  by  all  beneficiaries\u2019  landowners,  the \n8. \nProject  will  provide  due  diligence  documentation \nirrigation  perimeter.  The \ndocumentation  in  the  form  of  a  report  for  each  perimeter  will  indicate  (i)  the  names  of  the \nbeneficiary landowners, (ii) location of land plots, (iii) area of watercourses to be constructed in \neach plot, and (iv) proof of a signed agreement between the users and the EA. The report will \nalso (i) detail the participatory planning process on which the development of the perimeter has \nbeen based, (ii) discuss major issues dealt with and agreed to by the beneficiaries and the EA, \nand (iii) provide a schedule for executing  the needed works and the funds involved. \n \n9. \nThese  reports  will  be  included  in  the  general  design  of  each  perimeter  and  will  be  a \ncondition for starting construction activities in each perimeter. Preparation of the design and the \ndue  diligence  report  will  be  facilitated  from  the  beginning  of  the  planning  exercise  to  the  full \ncompletion  of  the  irrigation  facilities  by  a  social  mobilization  team,  Small  Dams  Organization \n(SDO),  and  the  resettlement  consultant  specialist.  The  process  will  be  monitored  by  an \nindependent third party. \n \nInstitutional Responsibilities. PIPD as the EA has overall responsibility for the Project \n10. \nincluding preparing, implementing, and financing the LAR.  PIPD will carry out its functions via a \nproject management unit (PMU). Specific resettlement capacity for the Project is located in the \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Section (LARS) of the safeguard unit of the PMU. LARS is \nstaffed  with  a  team  of  male  and  female  resettlement  specialists  and  seconded  staff  from  the \nrevenue  department.  The  seconded  staff  will  include  a  dedicated  land  acquisition  collector \n(LAC),  a  revenue  officer,  two  kanungo  (head  of  patwaris),  and  four  patwaris  (land  record \nkeeper). LARS will ensure LARP preparation and implementation together with the PIPD\u2019s SDO, \nfor  each  subproject. \nwhich \nCompensation  for  items  and  APs  eligible  under  Pakistani  law  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \ndedicated LAC, while compensation or income rehabilitation not covered in the Pakistani legal \nframework will be directly paid by the project director.  \n \n11. \nTask  Coordination  and  LARP  Approval  Process.  To  ensure  effective  coordination \nwith local governments and other agencies, PIPD will establish a LAR steering committee (LSC) \nat the provincial level. ADB will provide clearance for all LARPs. A nongovernment organization \nlocal  partner  will  be  engaged  for  community  liaison,  for  the  social  preparation  process  of \nprojects,  and  for  direct  liaison  with  APs.  All  concerned  staff  among  the  relevant  institutional \nactors  will  be  provided  with  intensive  training  on  the  ADB  policy,  LARF  principles,  and  LARP \npreparation  and  implementation  procedures.  The  training  will  be  provided  by  the  resettlement \nspecialists  of  the  project  implementation  consultant\u2019s  team  during  the  preparation  phase  for \neach subproject. \n \n12. \nDisclosure  and  Public  Consultation.  LARP  tasks  will  require  intensive  consultations \nwith APs and the results will be fully documented in the LARPs. As an appraisal condition, the \nLARF and LARPs in English will be disclosed on the ADB website while the LARF and LARPs in \nthe  local  language  will  be  disclosed  locally.  In  each  subproject  with  LAR  impacts,  an  affected \n\ninfrastructure  construction \n\nresponsible \n\nthe  actual \n\nfor \n\nis \n\n\f                                                                                                                           Appendix 7        \n\n43\n\npeople\u2019s committee (APC) inclusive of elected representatives of the APs will be formed during \nthe  census  survey.  The  APC  will  represent  the  interest  of  the  APs  and  provide  continuous \nliaison  between  the  EA  and  the  affected  communities  during  the  finalization  of  alignment  and \nlayout of the physical infrastructure and during planning, implementation, and monitoring of all \nLAR-related activities including complaints and grievances.   \n \n13. \nGrievance Procedures. To assist AP to appeal against any unacceptable LAR-related \ndecision, practice, or activity, a grievance redress mechanism will be instituted. As finances will \nmove differently for land and other items compensation or rehabilitation (in the first case, funds \nwill move from PIPD through the dedicated project LAC to the APs, while in the second funds \nwill go directly from PIPD to the APs), complaints and grievances will be addressed through two \ndifferent processes as described in Table A7.2. \n \n\nTable A7.2: Grievance Resolution Process \n \n\nProject and/or Other Items Compensation \nIssues under the EA \n\n1. Initially, complaints will be lodged verbally or in \nwriting  with  APC  assistance  to  the  PMU  field \noffice.  Resolution  is  sought  within  10  days  at  the \nvillage level. \n2. If still unsettled, a grievance can be lodged with \nthe head of LARS, who has 30 days to respond.  \n\n \nLand and/or Crops Compensation Issues \nunder the LAC \n1. Initially, complaints will be lodged verbally or in \nwriting  with  APC  assistance  to  the  PMU  field \noffice.  Resolution  is  sought  within  10  days  at  the \nvillage level. \n2. If still unsettled, a grievance can be lodged with \nthe  dedicated  LAC,  which  has  30  days  to  decide \non the case. \n3.  If  the  complaint  still  remains  unsolved,  the  AP \ncan  raise  it  to  the  head  of  the  PMU  office  in \nRawalpindi  within  1  month  of \nthe  original \ncomplaint  to  the  LAC.  The  PMU  will  review  and \nrule on the issue(s) within 21 days.  \n4.  Should  the  grievance  redress  system  fail  to \nsatisfy  the  AP,        the  AP  can  further  submit  the \ncase to the appropriate court of law. \nAP  =  affected  people,  APC  =  affected  people\u2019s  committee,  LAC  =  land  acquisition  collector,  LARS  =  Land \nAcquisition and Resettlement Section, PMU = project management unit.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n3.  If  the  complaint  still  remains  unsolved,  the  AP \ncan  raise  it  to  the  head  of  the  PMU  office  in \nRawalpindi  within  1  month  of \nthe  original \ncomplaint  to  the  head  of  LARS,  who  will  review \nand rule on the issue(s) within 21 days.  \n4.  Should  the  grievance  redress  system  fail  to \nsatisfy the AP, the AP can further submit the case \nto the appropriate court of law. \n\n \n14.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The  PMU  will  internally  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on \nLAR implementation. The EA will submit a quarterly report to ADB. External monitoring will be \ncarried out in the case of full LARPs and will be assigned to an independent agency by the EA. \nExternal  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year.  At  the  end  of  project \nimplementation, the independent monitoring agency  will carry out a general evaluation of LAR \nimplementation. \n \n15. \nbudgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \nD. \n \nOne  core  subproject  has  been  selected,  namely  the  Kot  Fateh  Khan  subproject, \n16. \ninvolving  the  construction  of  a  513  ha  reservoir  with  two  main  canals  and  a  secondary  water \ndistribution  system.  The  subproject  will  require  the  acquisition  of  529.72  ha  of  land,  of  which \n45.56 ha is cultivable and 484.16 ha is uncultivable. Of this land, 513.31 ha will be affected by \n\nFinances and Schedules. The LARF prescribes that each LARP include detailed LAR \n\nSpecific Resettlement Plans Impacts \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nthe  reservoir  and,  whether  classified  as  cultivable  or  not,  has  been  uncultivated  for  several \nyears. The remaining 16.41 ha will be acquired for the construction of both left and right bank \ncanals.  Of  these,  9.2  ha  is  cultivable,  0.27  ha  is  cultivable  and  irrigable,  and  6.94  ha  is \nwasteland.  \n\nThe subproject will not cause physical displacement of houses. A total of 68 households \n17. \n(510 persons) will be affected by land loss. Of these, 3 households (28 persons) to be affected \nby  the  reservoir  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  cultivable  agricultural  land  (18.4%,  21.5%,  and \n11.7%,  respectively)  but  will  not  be  severely  affected  as  no  income  is  generated  from  the \naffected  land  (which  has  remained  uncultivated  for  several  years).  Similarly,  two  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be affected by the main canal. As they will benefit from irrigation, their need for \nlivelihood enhancement is already substantially addressed by the project benefits. However, an \nadditional compensation in cash, equivalent to 3 months labor wages, will be provided to each. \nOther losses are one private fishpond and a public water supply scheme. \n \n18. \nPRs107,313,127  or  $1,767,270.

The  economic  prices  for  internationally  traded  commodities  (fertilizers  [urea,  di- \nammonium  phosphate,  and  potassium  chloride],  maize,  milk,  and  wheat)  are  calculated  using \nWorld Bank Global Prospects commodity price forecasts for international commodity prices and \nprice  projections.1  For  the  other  farm  inputs  and  outputs,  which  are  not  internationally  traded, \ndomestic farm-gate prices were used in the analysis. A standard conversion factor of 0.9  was \napplied to local costs and benefits, while for rural labor this was combined with a shadow price \nfactor of 0.78,2 implying a combined factor of 0.7, which reduces the current financial price for \nfarm labor from PRs150 per person-day to an economic price of PRs105 per person-day.  \n \n3. \n \n4. \nthe analysis are described below. \n \n\nThe  other  data  and  assumptions  are  used  in  calculating  the  EIRRs,  and  the  results  of \n\nAn exchange rate of $1 = PRs60.73 has been used.3 \n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation Period and Period of Analysis \n\n \n For the KFK core subproject, major capital works are to be implemented over a 3-year \n5. \nperiod  (2008\u20132010)  inclusive,  with  ongoing  project  costs  in  2011\u20132013  relating  only  to  minor \nwater  supply  connection  costs.  After  the  3-year  construction  period,  the  benefits  of  the  capital \nworks  are  assessed  over  the  next  25  years,  giving  an  analysis  period  of  28  years.  However, \ngiven  that  the  economic  life  of  the  dam  is  expected  to  be  in  excess  of  50  years  due  to  \nwatershed management and the sediment flushing facility, a residual value equal to 60% of the \ndam\u2019s cost is included as a residual value of the core subproject.4  \n \n6.  \nFirst benefits from the investment are expected from the first year of water availability in \nyear 4 (2011), but full benefits are not assumed to be achieved until 2016. Adoption of irrigated \nagriculture,  including  new  practices  and  technique,  is  assumed  to  start  from  the  first  year  of \nwater availability (after 3 years of design, construction, and impoundment) on a staggered basis. \nBenefits will therefore materialize as follows over the first 6 years of water availability: 5%, 15% \n35%, 65%, 90%, and 100%. \n\n \n2. \n\nEconomic Costs \n \n\n7. \nThe  economic  investment costs for the KFK  core subproject  have  been based on the \nfinancial cost estimates contained in Appendix 4 covering three components: (i) component 1, \n\n                                                 \n1    In  the  case  of  milk,  World  Bank  price  forecasts  are  not  available  and  data  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Policy \n\nResearch Institute (FAPRI) has been used. \n\n2  Source: TA consultants\u2019 draft final report, Supplementary Appendix M. The shadow wage rate factor is to account \n\nfor unemployment and underemployment within the project area.  \n\n3  Source: Identified in the TA consultants\u2019 report as the rate in March 2007. During the Review Mission in May/June \n\n2007 the exchange rate was at a similar level. \n\n4  The watershed conservation measures undertaken as part of the subproject are expected to lift the residual value \nof  the  dam  from  50%  to  60%  of  its  total  economic  cost  at  time  of  construction.  (See  economic  analysis  of \nwatershed conservation and management measures later in this appendix.)  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nwhich  covers  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  dam  construction,  main  and  branch  canals, \nwatershed  conservation  and  management,  and  environmental  management  and  monitoring; \n(ii) component 2, which includes watercourse construction, field layout and leveling,  services of \nthe Commonwealth Assistance Bureau International (CABI), agriculture and livestock extension \nservices,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation;  and  (iii)  component  3,  which  includes  project \nimplementation and capacity building.  \n\n \n\n8. \nFor components 1 and 2, the detailed cost estimates prepared by the TA consultants are \nused as a basis and adjusted as refinements to the subproject are made. For component 3, a \ndetailed  cost  budget  for  project  implementation  and  capacity  building  was  prepared  for  the \noverall project and 11.2% of this budget was estimated as the share of the KFK subproject. This \napportionment  was  based  on  KFK\u2019s  2,024  ha  of  cultivable  command  area  (CCA)  developed \nunder the subproject, 9,900 ha of new CCA to be developed by the overall Project, 10,000 ha of \nCCA  improved  as  a  consequence  of  irrigation  system  rehabilitation  works  under  the  project, \n1,000 ha of CCA improved as a consequence of irrigation system extension under the project, \nand each rehabilitated and extension  hectare requiring 75% of project management unit (PMU) \ntime   compared with the new CCA hectare developed under the Project.5 \n \n9. \nTaxes  and  duties  have  been  omitted  together  with  price  contingencies,  since  the \neconomic  analysis  is  undertaken  in  constant  2007  price  terms.  Physical  contingencies  have \nbeen included.   \n \n10. \nOngoing maintenance costs for the KFK subproject (2011\u20132035) have been estimated at \n$74,033 per annum, based on 2.5% of the main and branch canal and watercourse investment \neconomic  costs,  $18,0006  for  ongoing  environmental  monitoring,  and  $5,2717  for  annual \nelectricity and maintenance costs for the pumps installed as part of the KFK subproject. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \n11. \nThe  KFK  core  subproject  benefits  come  from  agricultural  crops,  livestock,  electricity \nsupply, domestic water supply, fuel wood, and fishing. These have been estimated on the basis \nof  data  and  information  in  the  TA  consultants\u2019  draft  final  report,  augmented  with  additional \ninformation and data from the field and government offices during the Asian Development Bank \nreview mission.  \n \n\na. \n\nAgricultural Crop Benefits \n\n12. \nThe  sources  of  the  agricultural  crop  benefits  for  the  KFK  core  subproject  will  be  the \ngreater  availability  of  water,  more  efficient  use  of  already  available  water,8  and  the  farmer \ntraining  and  extension  services  provided  under  the  Project.  The  subproject  enables  cropping \nintensity  within  the  CCA  of  2,024  ha  to  rise  from  60%  to  120%.This  increase  in  cropping \nintensity  incorporates  the  introduction  of  new  more  valuable  crops\u2014vegetables  (including \nonions and cauliflowers), fruit (guava), and oilseeds (sunflower)\u2014as well as an increase in the \ncultivated areas of traditional crops such as fodder, gram, maize, and wheat. For the 2,000 ha9 \ncultivated outside the CCA, no increase in cropping intensity is assumed. \n\n                                                 \n5 This 11.2% apportionment for the KFK subproject  was also used to determine the subproject\u2019s share of the CABI \n\ncontract under component 2. \n\n6  $20,000 x 0.9 (the conversion factor). \n7  $96,575 @$0.042/kWh +$1,800 (= 15% value of pumps) for maintenance all times the conversion factor. \n8  In the case of existing dams. \n9  The  2,000  ha  of  the  area  improved  outside  the  CCA  will  be  assisted  by  the  watershed  conservation  and \nmanagement component of the Project in conjunction with improved training and extension services. The economic \nbenefits of this are considered later in this appendix. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                              Appendix  11   \n\n53\n\n 13.  Within  the  CCA,  significant  increases  in  yield  are  expected  as  a  consequence  of  the \nsubproject. Especially significant is the increases for wheat (from 0.5 t/ha to 3.16 t/ha). Outside \nthe  CCA,  smaller  increases  in  yield  are  expected  as  a  consequence  of  the  training  and \nextension  services  components  of  the  subproject.  The  changes  in  cropping  pattern  and  yields \nwith and without the Project within the CCA are summarized in Table A11.1. \n \n\nTable A11.1: With and Without Project Crop Production \n \n\nYields (t/ha) \n\n \n \n\nCropping Pattern (%) \nWithout \nProject \n33.0 \n  2.0 \n\u2014 \n  0.5 \n\u2014 \n  1.0 \n\u2014 \n  2.0 \n12.0 \n  3.5 \n  1.5 \n  3.5 \n\u2014 \n 1.0 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n60.0 \n\nWheat \nRapeseed \nOnion \nGram \nCauliflower \nRabi fodder \nGuava \nMaize \nGroundnut \nSorghum \nMillet \nMash \nSunflower \nKharif fodder \nVegetable \nGuava \nTotal \nt/ha = ton per hectare \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nWith \nProject \n  45.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n    5.0 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n    5.0 \n  10.0 \n    5.0 \n  10.0 \n    5.0 \n120.0 \n\nWithout \nProject \n 0.50 \n 0.79 \n\u2014 \n 0.35 \n\u2014 \n11.68 \n\u2014 \n 0.71 \n 0.42 \n 0.21 \n 0.40 \n 0.40 \n\u2014 \n 9.90 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n \n\nWith \nProject \n  3.16 \n  1.80 \n18.79 \n  0.90 \n13.49 \n19.00 \n12.35 \n  1.79 \n  1.49 \n  0.80 \n  0.80 \n  0.90 \n  2.47 \n25.02 \n16.00 \n12.35 \n \n\n \n14. \n For  each  crop,  financial  and  economic  gross  margins  without  and  with  the  subproject \nare  determined.  These  determinations  combine  data  on  yields,  input  requirements,  and \neconomic farm-gate prices for outputs and inputs.  \n \n15. \nThe cropped areas and the gross margins are then combined to determine the level of \nagricultural crop economic benefits at full subproject impact. This is estimated to be $953,031 \nper  annum,  consisting  of  $931,046  within  the  CCA  and  $21,985  outside  the  CCA,  or  $460/ha \ninside the CCA and $22/ha outside the CCA.10  \n \n \n \n16. \nThe  number  of  households  in  the  KFK  subproject  area  is  estimated  at  1,345,  and \nestimates of the number of each type of livestock and yields with and without the Project are in \nTable A11.2. \n \n \n \n \n\nLivestock Benefits \n\nb. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10 The increase in economic benefits outside the CCA is relatively modest because, while some increases in yields \n\nare expected, they will require increased inputs (fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, and labor). \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nTable A11.2: With and Without Project Livestock Production \n \nWithout \nProject \n(liters of \nmilk per \nannum) \n1512\n675\n26\n63\n\nWith \nProject \n(liters of \nmilk per \nannum) \n2016\n810\n45\n94\n9,936 100(eggs) 130(eggs)\n\nWithout \nProject \n(offspring \nper annum) \n0.7 \n1.0 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n1(carcass) \n\nType \n551 \nBuffaloes \n1,184 \nCows \n4,829 \nSheep \n10,464 \nGoats \nPoultry \n7,949 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nWith \nProject \n(no.) \n689\n1,480\n6,036\n13,080\n\nWithout \nProject \n(no.) \n\nWith \nProject \n(offspring \nper annum)\n0.7\n1.0\n1.1\n1.1\n1(carcass)\n\n \n17. \nThese data are combined with gross margins per animal, and the assumption is that the \nsubproject, in addition to increasing livestock gross margins per animal, will lead to an increase \nof  25%  in  livestock  numbers  in  the  subproject  area  to  give  livestock  economic  benefits  of \n$1,185,250,  or  $881  per  household,  at  full  subproject  impact.11  These  increases  in  livestock \nnumber  and  productivity  result  from  the  high  increase  in  crops  residue  and  fodder  due  to  the \nconversion to irrigated agriculture and the adoption of improved practices. \n \n\nc. \n\nDomestic Water Supply Benefits \n\n \nIt is estimated12 that the supply of domestic water by the KFK subproject will reduce by 2 \n18. \nhours per day the time it takes one person in each household to collect water. Combining this \nwith  the  shadow-priced  rural  wage  rate  of  PRs105  per  day  gives  annual  benefits  of  $158  per \nconnected household13 per annum. In addition, the improved water supply from the subproject is \nestimated  to  halve  the  average  cost  per  household  of  costs14  associated  with  waterborne \ndiseases and prevent the loss of 10 days of semiskilled labor (valued at PRs300 per day) per \nannum per connected household. These two benefits have economic values of $13 and $35 per \nconnected  household  per  annum,  respectively,  implying  a  total  benefit  per  household  of  $206 \nper  annum.  These  benefits  would  be  received  as  soon  as  construction  of  the  dams  and  the \nrelated domestic water supply system is complete, assumed to be at the start of year 4, that is, \nby  2011.  These  costs  need  to  be  deducted  from  the  costs  of  new  connections  ($20.5  per \nhousehold in economic price terms) and water supply system maintenance costs ($15,879 per \nannum in economic price terms).  \n \n19.  \n The KFK village water supply system on its own is estimated to yield an EIRR of 35.4%. \nThe  net  economic  benefits  of  this  analysis  from  2011  onward15  are  included  in  the  EIRR \ncalculated for the whole KFK subproject.  \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11  No  account  is  taken  of  population  growth  and  the  consequent  increase  in  the  without-project  numbers  of \nhouseholds  and  livestock.  To  the  extent  that  this  understates  livestock  economic  benefits,  the  analysis  is \nconservative. \n\n12 The TA consultants discounted 1 hour of water collection time as being \u201cotherwise unproductive\u201d. However, given \nthat  shadow  pricing  of  the  daily  labor  rate  has  already  accounted  for  unemployment  and  underemployment,  it  is \nincorrect to effectively again shadow price this labor.  \n\n13 In 2010, it is estimated that there will be 1,451 connected households (80% of total households), growing at 2.2% \n\n14 Including transport, doctors\u2019 fees, medicine, and laboratory work. \n15 The capital costs for the years 2008\u20132010 are already included in the KFK total project costs. \n\nper annum. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                              Appendix  11   \n\n55\n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nd. \n\nFishing Benefits \n\nWatershed Benefits \n\n \n \n20. \nThe TA consultants\u2019 report gives the annual catch value for the KFK subproject reservoir \nas PRs7,914,980 (based on a catch of 94,980 kilograms [kg)] per annum and a financial price of \nPRs90 per kg) less stocking cost (PRs633,198), or $117,302 applying the standard conversion \nfactor (0.9) and exchange rate (60.72794).16 This is equivalent to $742 per ha of water surface \narea.  \n \n \n \n21. \nThe benefits of forestry activities within the watershed area are based on an estimated \n50 donkey loads of fuel wood per annum per ha on 213 ha of land. The value of fuel wood is \nestimated at PRs120 per load, or PRs108 in economic prices. These benefits are assumed to \ncommence in year 9 (2016) and equal $18,940 per annum. \n \n22. \nIn  addition,  there  are  two  other  economic  benefits  from  watershed  conservation  and \nmanagement.  First,  the  dam\u2019s  residual  value  is  estimated  to  increase  from  50%  to  60%  of  its \ntotal  economic  cost  ($4,983,317)  at  the  end  of  the  analysis  period.  Second,  the  watershed \nconservation  and  management  subcomponent  will  provide  an  additional  2,000  ha  of  area \noutside the CCA, which will benefit from the subproject interventions.17 These additional benefits \nare included with the firewood benefits and give an estimated EIRR of 5.6% for the watershed \nsubcomponent for these three benefits alone.   \n \n \n \nElectricity generated by the KFK subproject is estimated at 372,489 kilowatt-hours (kWh) \n23. \nper annum from 2011 onward. Applying a value of $0.042 per kWh gives an economic value of \n$14,080 per annum. \n \n\nElectricity Benefits \n\nf. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nResults \n\na. \n\nBase Case \n\nCombining the economic benefits with the project capital and annual maintenance costs \n\n \n24. \ngives an estimated base case EIRR of 14.3% for the KFK core subproject.   \n \n\nb. \n\nSensitivity Testing \n\n \n25. \nIf  project  investment  costs  are  increased  by  20%,  the  EIRR  decreases  to  12.4%.  If \nproject  benefits  are  decreased  by  20%  (for  instance,  if  the  dam  is  out  of  water  due  to  a \nprolonged  drought  for  at  least  5  years),  the  EIRR  decreases  to  11.9%.  A  combination  of  20% \nincrease in project costs and 20% decrease in project benefits gives an EIRR of 10.2%. If, when \nconstructed,  the  Project  operates  for  only  15  years  (i.e.,  until  the  end  of  2025),  the  EIRR  is \n12.0%. \n \n26. \nThe analysis has excluded the replacement costs for trees and the watershed sediment  \ntrap  (after  15  years  of  project  operation)  and  the  watercourses  (after  20  years  of  project \noperation). However, the inclusion of such costs would have little impact on the EIRR because \n\n                                                 \n16  The  TA  consultants  also  deduct  an  amount  paid  by  way  of  an  auction  every  3  years  for  the  right  to  use  the \n\nreservoir for fish production. However, this is just a transfer and not an economic cost.  \n\n17  See TA consultants\u2019 draft report. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nof the effects of discounting and the small costs of these items relative to the total project cost \nand benefits.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nFinancial  farm  budgets  have  been  prepared  utilizing  data  contained  in  the  project \n27. \npreparatory technical assistance report on average farm sizes, cropping patterns, and livestock \nownership  for  small,  medium-sized,  and  large  landowner  and  tenant  farmers,  but  utilizing  the \nfinancial crop and livestock gross margins.

However,  the  analysis  is  conservative  in  that  no  account  is \ntaken  of  increases  in  cropping  intensity  (from  60%  to  120%)  and  livestock  ownership  (25% \nincrease). \n \nThe  analysis  shows  increases  in  farmer  incomes  of  between  $147  and  $7,274  per \n29. \nannum  at  full  project  impact,  depending  on  land  tenure  and  farm  size.  The  range  is  wide \nbecause of the substantial variation in the size of landholdings in the project area. In percentage \nterms,  the  increase  across  the  different  landholding  sizes  and  land  ownership  alternatives  is \n34%\u2013198%. \n \n30. \nNo  account  has  been  taken  of  the  project  beneficiary  contributions,  which  will  be \nrequired  to  partly  finance  various  components  of  the  Project  such  as  (i)  the  main  and  branch \ncanals  (5%),18  (ii)  watershed  conservation  and  management  (10%),  (iii)  watercourse \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  (20%),  (iv)  the  field  layout  and  leveling  (20%),  and  (v)  village \nwater supply and sanitation (2%). This is because these costs will be largely incurred during the \n3 years of project construction, whereas the analysis of incremental farm income focuses on full \nproject impact, which will not be achieved until 2016, several years after the Project has been \ncompleted. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis of the Extension and Rehabilitation of Existing Dam Irrigation        \nSchemes  \n\n \n31.  Whereas  the  KFK  subproject  involves  dam  construction  together  with  the  provision  of \nirrigation water supply facilities, some of the overall Project\u2019s funds will be directed at extending \nand rehabilitating irrigation water supply facilities associated with existing dams. The economic \nviability of such activities will benefit from the sunk costs of completed dams. However, where \n\n                                                 \n18  Proposed beneficiaries\u2019 financing share. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                              Appendix  11   \n\n57\n\nfacilities are being rehabilitated, the economic benefits will be lower since some of the benefits \nmeasured in the case of the KFK subproject will have been achieved even without the project \ninterventions.  On  balance,  it  is  expected  that  the  reduction  in  costs  will  be  greater  than  the \nreduction  in  incremental  benefits  and  therefore  the  EIRRs  for  extension  and  rehabilitation \ncomponents will be greater than those calculated for the KFK subproject. \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in \nCountry Poverty Analysis? \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in \nthe  Country \nPartnership \nAgreement? \n\nPoverty \n\nYes \n\nContribution of the sector/subsectors to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nA  comparison  of  poverty  indicators  between  2001  and  2005  shows  a  considerable  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \npoverty in Pakistan from 34.5% to 23.9%.  Although the reduction of the number of people living below the poverty \nline  has  been  considerable,  the  standard  of  living  of  those  people  remains  low  and  their  vulnerability  to  volatile \neconomic, health, and climatic conditions is significant. Insufficient economic growth and employment, vulnerability \nto  drought,  gender  disparities,  and  inadequate  community  participation  are  observed  among  the  chief  causes  of \npoverty.  Pro-poor  growth  in  Pakistan  therefore  requires  increased  agricultural  productivity  based  on  sustainable \nenvironment management to protect the resource bases of the poor.   \n \nThe  poverty  reduction  strategy  proposes,  among  others,  access  to  land  and  water,  protection  of  natural  resource \nbases  used  by  the  poor,  rural  employment  and  job  creation  as  well  as  community  participation  and  social \nmobilization  as  key  development  needs  and  priorities  of  the  poor.  Diversification  and  improved  productivity  of \nagriculture, and infrastructure development, as well as improved governance are among the investment priorities of \nthe  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB). \n \nThe Barani Integrated Water Resources Sector Project will make a significant contribution to the realization of these \ngoals  and  strategies  in  the  subproject  sites.  The  stabilization  and  improved  management  of  water  resources  for \nirrigation  will permit the introduction of high-yielding cash crop agriculture at the same  time increase the reliability \nand  productivity  of  subsistence  agriculture.  Furthermore,  the  establishment  of  the  reservoir  and  the  potential \ncreation of smaller fishponds will facilitate the development of fisheries resources as a source of livelihood. This will \nimprove  the  incomes  of  the  beneficiary  farmers  as  well  as  their  nutritional  status.  In  addition,  wage  labor  income \nopportunities  in  local  agriculture  will  increase  due  to  the  labor-intensive  and  year-round  cultivation  of  cash  crops, \nthus  benefiting  poor  small  farmers  and  landless  laborers.  The  provision  of  water  supply  and  concomitant  health \nimprovements  will  also  spread  project  benefits  among  all  inhabitants  of  the  project  area,  including  the  poor  and \nespecially women, for whom water supply for domestic and livestock purposes is among the most important needs. \n \nB. Poverty Analysis   \n\n  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nA  social  and  poverty  assessment  was  carried  out  in  the  project  areas  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations (1993). Apart from the general assessment of poverty and \nits  characteristics,  the  required  poverty  analysis  has  addressed  the  linkages  between  the  rural  poor  and  irrigated \nagriculture. It included an assessment of the incidence of poverty, which revealed the nature and perception of its \ncauses:  (i)  landlessness;  (ii)  near-landlessness;  (iii)  temporary  low-income  jobs  in  nonagricultural  sectors;  (iv) \ninequitable access to infrastructure and facilities; (v) lack of basic services (health, education, nutrition); (vi) lack of \nalternative livelihood; (vii) low literacy;  and (viii) gender bias.  \n\nThe social analysis identified vulnerable groups who would be unable to benefit fully from the project interventions \nwithout  some  preparation.  They  include  (i)  female  heads  of  households,  (ii)  the  landless  and  near-landless,  (iii) \ntenants and sharecroppers, and (iv) marginal farmers. \n\nThe Project will ensure that services delivered through the field programs of the command area development and \ndomestic  water  supply  component  will  have  programs  targeting  women,  and  marginal  and  landless  farmers.  The \nProject  requires  full  community  participation,  and  sensitization  and  training  of  staff  to  ensure  that  poor  and  small \nfarmers  are  not  excluded  from  project  activities  such  as  subproject  identification,  planning  and  implementation \nprocess, and organization for water user associations, conservation action groups, and agriculture interest groups. \nCommunity participation is further expected to lead to improved levels of confidence and inclusion for the marginal, \nand to facilitate efforts to improve the economic  welfare of beneficiaries that are beyond the specific scope of the \nProject. \n\nThe Project will generate benefits for the poor in terms of access to irrigation water, domestic water supply, right to \nreservoir  fisheries,  cultivation  in  the  drawdown  area  of  the  reservoir,  employment  in  construction,  preferential \naccess to or custodianship of catchment resources for defined exploitation and management purposes, catchment \ndevelopment  such  as  planting  fruit  trees  or  reforestation,  access  to  pumped  irrigation  from  the  reservoir,  income \nsupport for vulnerable or needy households; agricultural support services including preferred planting materials and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  \n\n59\n\n \n\nother inputs; community forests and grazing areas; and access to preferential water and service charges. \n\n \nC. Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?      Yes \n \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  a  highly  participatory  process  undertaken  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance beginning with a stakeholder analysis. Wide stakeholder consultations were conducted using a range of \nparticipatory tools and methods. The field research activities were carried out by both male and female staff to allow \nfor separate focus group sessions for women who normally do not participate in public events due to strict gender \nsegregation  customs.  The  field  activities  led  to  an  inventory  of  the  project  populations,  their  key  problems  and \ndevelopment  priorities,  dimensions  of  land and  water resource use,  social  indicators  of  well-being,  and  key  social \ninstitutions  in  the  project  communities.  Workshops  organized  with  the  community  synthesized  the  findings  and \nresulted  in  the  development  of  a  mechanism  to  institutionalize  local  community  participation  in  the  anticipated \ninterventions. The project team also held consultations with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to discuss their \npossible involvement in the Project, particularly for social mobilization activities.  \n \nIs there a participatory social development strategy prepared? Yes  \n \nProject implementation will be based on a carefully designed community mobilization process, which is essential for \nsuccessful  implementation  and,  more  importantly,  to  ensure  the  future  sustainability  of  project  investments.  The \nstrategy provides a useful frame of reference for processes and the extent people are involved in decision making.  \nThe participation strategy prescribes the formation of several committees including a Citizen Community Board and \naffected people\u2019s committees with male and female members, as a mechanism to facilitate community participation \nin the planning and eventual implementation, to permit the concerned stakeholders to assess and respond to project \nplans  and  designs,  and  to  proactively  avoid  disputes.  The  proposed  sequence  of  activities  for  community \nmobilization includes (i) community awareness campaigns describing the Project, its objectives, scope, procedures, \nand  required  assessment  of  the  communities\u2019  demand  for  the  Project;  ((ii)  community  participation  in  the  pre-\nfeasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  development  of  community  irrigation  and  water  supply  systems;  (iii)  community \nmobilization  to  form  community  organizations  inclusive  of  women;  (iv)  community  capacity  building;  and  (v) \ncommunity monitoring, evaluation, and feedback mechanism for subproject performance. \n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  expertise  and  experience  of  NGOs  that  have  demonstrated  their  strengths  in \ncommunity mobilization within the project districts and disciplines. The frontline \u201cworkers\u201d will be the district project \nstaff that will function as technical advisors, and NGOs will be employed to assist in strengthening communities to \nenable them to participate in implementing the community  portions of subprojects.  It is envisaged that the NGOs \nwill provide an interface between the technical staff and the community. The Project will also establish procedures \nfor close coordination among district-level administration, NGOs, and community organizations for effective service \ndelivery. \n \nThe participation strategy is presented in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n \nD. Gender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women \n \nGender  disparity  and  female  disadvantages  are  inherent  features  of  the  social  structure  in  Pakistan.  Despite \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  economic  activities  in  Punjab,  both  as  unpaid  family  farm  workers,  paid  on-farm  and \ndomestic  laborers,  as  well  as  being  responsible  for  livestock  and  domestic  work,  their  participation  in  formal \ncommunity decision making is almost entirely missing.  \n \nThe gender strategy focuses on enhancing rural female incomes from indirect improvements to the domestic water \nsupply,  and  from  opportunities  to  participate  in  their  organizations.  The  organizations  will  (i)  enable  women  to \ninfluence the decision-making process of the irrigator community with regard to domestic, livestock, and watershed \ndevelopment  water  requirements;  (ii)  facilitate  their  participation  in  overall  community  decision-making  processes, \nand (iii) strengthen their status at the community household level.  \n \nSpecific measures will be undertaken to ensure (i) all staff working on the Project are provided training on gender \nissues; (ii) staff involved in the social mobilization process equally involve women and men; (iii) provision for building \nthe  capacity  of  village  women  for  techniques  and  practices  of  irrigated  cash  crop  agriculture,  post-harvest \nmanagement,  agro-processing  and  plant  nursery  development  with  microfinance  support;  (iv)  employment \nopportunities for women in the watershed conservation activities of the Project; and (v) management opportunities \nfor women in domestic water supply and sanitation facilities, including hygiene education.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?     Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nThe gender action plan is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n \nE.
