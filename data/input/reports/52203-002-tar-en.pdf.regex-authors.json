THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program (SESIP), financed through a \nresults-based lending (RBL), was requested by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Government of \nSri Lanka (the government).1 The program is aligned with the government\u2019s Education Sector \nDevelopment Plan 2020\u20132025, and focuses on secondary education reforms.2 The program is \nalso an integral and vital part of the government\u2019s Contingency Emergency Response Plan \n(CERP) for general education.3  \n \n2.  The RBL program, amounting to $400 million, will be implemented over a period of 5 years. \nThe expected impact will be human resource development enhanced, supporting healthy and \nproductive citizens and a globally competitive knowledge-centered economy.4 The expected \noutcome will be secondary education system transformed and aligned with evolving labor force \nneeds. It aims to achieve this through (i) enhanced quality and relevance of secondary science, \ntechnology, mathematics, and commerce (STMC) programs; (ii) strengthened provincial and \nschool capacity to implement education reforms; and (iii) strengthened secondary education \nsector management capacity. SESIP builds on the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s long-term \nengagement in the education sector in Sri Lanka, and on successes and learning from the \ncompleted  Education  Sector  Development  Program.5 In  addition,  SESIP  will  also  address \nchallenges faced in education as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The \nprogram is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20306 and the country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022, \nand is included in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022.7  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Background. In 2019, Sri Lanka was classified as a lower middle-income economy with \na per capita income of $4,020,8 just under the upper middle-income category of $4,046.

Its impact is expected to contract GDP by 3.2\u20134.7% in 2020, disrupt labor \nmarkets,  increase  the  deficit  to  over  10%  of  GDP,  and  sharply  increase  poverty.11 The \ngovernment has so far contained the outbreak, with 46,248 confirmed cumulative cases and 219 \ndeaths as of 7 January 2021.12  \n \n4.  Education sector context. Compared with other middle-income countries, Sri Lanka \nranks high in access to primary and secondary education with gender parity at both levels.13 \nDespite high access, improving quality and labor market relevance of secondary education is a \nkey issue. There is a mismatch between the graduates that the education system is producing \nand  the  needs  of  the  labor  market.  Sri  Lanka  faces  a  shortage  of  trained  workers.  The \nunemployment rates among youth (21%) and women (7%) are higher than the national average \nof 4%. The percentage of youth not in employment, education, or training is 22% (29% for females, \n14% for males).  \n \n5.  Secondary education should play a key role in building the pipeline for post-secondary \neducation and the labor market, but the Sri Lankan secondary education system faces several \nchallenges. One key challenge is the limited and inequitable access to STMC subjects in senior \nsecondary schools. Only about a third of senior secondary students were enrolled in science and \ntechnology streams in 2018.14 This means that secondary education is not building a foundation \nin science and technology which form the basis of modern jobs. Inadequate quality and relevance \nof education also pose significant challenges. Secondary education learning outcomes are poor.15 \nThe curricula are generally heavy on content and lack an inquiry-based approach and practical \napplications.  Inadequate  quality  of  teaching  contributes  to  poor  learning  outcomes.16 The \nassessment system relies solely on high-stakes testing, associated with information recall, rather \nthan analysis and problem-solving.17 Secondary education is not producing graduates with critical \nthinking, problem-solving, team work and communication skills that are needed to survive and \nthrive  in  the  modern  economy.  The  third  key  challenge  includes  the  need  to  strengthen \neducational leadership and sector management capacity.  \n \n \n10 This is estimated by the International Monetary Fund in February 2020. ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook \n2020. Manila. \n11 The $5.50 poverty headcount ratio is estimated to rise from 36.5% in 2019 to 43.5% in 2020. World Bank and ADB. \n2020.

(Government of Sri Lanka, MOE. 2020. Sri Lanka: General Education Sector Development \nPlan 2020\u20132025. Colombo). Gender parity has been achieved at primary and lower secondary levels but at upper \nsecondary level, 109 girls are enrolled for every 100 boys. (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization Institute for Statistics). The school structure consists of primary (grades 1\u20135), junior secondary (grades \n6\u20139), and senior secondary (grades 10\u201313). \n14 Of national enrolments by General Certificate of Education Advanced Level stream, 23% were in the science stream \nand 11%  in  the  technology  stream  in  2018.

Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Examinations (DOE). 2019. Statistics and School Performance \nIndices. Colombo (accessed 13 June 2020). \n16 Teacher training and professional development currently emphasize content knowledge as a means of improving pass \nrates in national examinations. Thus, teachers often teach to the test. Teachers are not sufficiently trained in inquiry-\nbased teaching-learning practices that support students to think critically and apply what they have learned. \n17 Classroom assessments need to be integrated into daily teaching practice to support student learning and guide \nteachers.  \n ", "3 \n6.  COVID-19  impact  and  lessons.  The  COVID-19  outbreak  has  disrupted  education \ndelivery.18 Over 5.57 million learners have been affected by school and university closures across \nthe country, of which 2.73 million are at secondary level (footnote 18). To minimize learning \ndisruptions, the government has prepared a CERP for general education and employed e-learning \nplatforms and/or classes through television (footnote 3). However, not all children and teachers \nhave  access to  the  devices,  digital-based  learning  platforms,  and  connectivity  required for \ndistance education.19 Only 34.1% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population (ages 5\u201369 years) are able to use the \ninternet.20 Many teachers lack practical experience in using such approaches effectively. Thus, \nthe pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing challenges in education, including low learning \noutcomes and rural-urban inequity. The loss of learning will delay children\u2019s attainment of age-\nappropriate learning competencies, and as children are unable to keep pace with learning, more \ndropouts are likely.  \n \n7.  The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for making the education system more \nresilient  against  shocks,  which means: (i)  integrating multiple  online and  distance  learning \napproaches; (ii) building teacher capacity in digital skills and distance modes of teaching-learning; \n(iii) developing and implementing e-learning resources; and (iv) supporting remedial lessons for \nstudents left behind during school closures. Overall, the pandemic has highlighted the urgent \nneed to strengthen the equity and use of digital education and blended learning strategies,21 \nwhich must be addressed to mitigate inequalities. Recovery planning must also ensure that \ncontext-specific support to provincial and rural schools lays a sustainable foundation for the \neducational reforms. SESIP cannot afford a delay, as it is also a crucial part of the CERP, which \nthe government has started implementing last year.  \n \n8.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) for SESIP will provide capacity building and \nimplementation  support  for  smooth  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  systemic  and \ntransformational reform agenda. It will also support medium- to long-term efforts in building the \ncapacity in the education sector to respond quickly and flexibly to similar emergencies in the future, \nsimilar to the COVID-19 pandemic. The RBL program supports systemwide reforms in the \neducation sector and will focus on 750 schools, of which 80% are provincial schools. By 2026, \nreforms supported by the program will benefit about 953,000 students (503,000 females and \n450,000 males) annually. The program will also have equipped 47,853 teachers (31,583 women \nand 16,270 men) with skills that will benefit successive generations of students. Given the \nambitious reforms targeted by the RBL, the government requested for dedicated resources to \nfinance critical technical inputs to support reform initiatives. The TA will address quality and equity \nissues and will provide the much-needed expertise to adequately respond to the current education \nsector challenges. The TA will ensure prioritization of the key reforms and achievement of the \nprogram\u2019s intended results areas in a smooth and timely manner. As program systems are used \nto implement the RBL program, and reforms are implemented by government staff, the TA will be \nused  to  strengthen  RBL  program  systems  and  capacity,  enhance  sustainability,  and \n \n18 Schools have been closed nationwide since 13 March 2020.
