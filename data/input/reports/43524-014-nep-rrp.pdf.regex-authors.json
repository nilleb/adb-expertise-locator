I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand  grant,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  and  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development (OFID), both \nto Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Wastewater Management Project.1   \n \n2.  The project will complement past and ongoing efforts of the government toward improving \nwastewater  services  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley.2  The  project  will  invest  in  rehabilitation  and \nexpansion  of  the  sewerage  network,  modernization  and  expansion  of  wastewater  treatment \nplants (WWTPs), and improved wastewater management in the Kathmandu Valley. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.    Current status. The population of the Kathmandu Valley was 2.51 million in 2011, and is \ngrowing at a high rate of 4.3% per annum, while Nepal\u2019s total population is growing at 1.4% per \nannum.3  Rapid  and  unplanned  urban  growth  and  inadequate  investments  in  wastewater \nmanagement have resulted in poor quality wastewater services in the Kathmandu Valley. The \ndisposal of untreated sewage  in rivers affects the quality of surface and ground water and \nincreases disease incidence, health risks, and associated economic burdens,4 particularly for the \npoor and socially excluded groups, notably women. The focus on wastewater complements and \nbuilds on past and ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects in water supply. Since 2000, \nADB  has  been  working  with  the  government  in  urban  water  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley  in \ndeveloping water sources and treatment plants, improving transmission and distribution networks, \nand undertaking institutional reforms.5 The 27.5-kilometer Melamchi tunnel is a key component of \nthe water supply system. It will significantly increase water volumes through transfer of water from \nthe Melamchi River to the Kathmandu Valley, and its performance impacts the pace and progress \nof downstream urban projects in the Kathmandu Valley. Further, as part  of the institutional \nreforms, three water and wastewater organizations were created in 2008\u2015the Kathmandu Valley \nWater  Supply  Management  Board  (KVWSMB),  the  asset  owner;  Kathmandu  Upatyaka \nKhanepani Limited (KUKL), the asset operator and service provider; and the Water Supply Tariff \nFixation Commission (WSTFC), the regulator. These organizations are still in the process of fully \noperationalizing their mandates in an effective and efficient manner.  \n \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

The closing date of Loan 1820-NEP was 31 March 2007, and was \nextended to 31 December 2013. Loan 2058-NEP(SF) was closed on 31 December 2008. The closing date of Loan \n2059-NEP[SF] was 30 June 2011 and was extended to 31 December 2014. \n ", "2 \n4.  Focus on capacity building and service delivery. The project will strengthen KUKL, \nKVWSMB, and WSTFC to increase operational efficiency and improve service delivery, and will \nresult in positive impacts on health and quality of life for Kathmandu Valley residents. With the \ncompletion of the ongoing projects (footnote 5), the Kathmandu Valley will receive an additional \n170 million liters per day (MLD) of water in 2016 (the current average availability of water is only \n100 MLD6). The sewerage system, which is inadequate even to manage existing low levels of \nwater supply, will be further overburdened by more than 125 MLD of additional wastewater.7 Of \nfive existing WWTPs, only one, which has a capacity of 16.4 MLD, is based on a mechanized \ntreatment  process;  the  rest  are  waste  stabilization  pond  systems.  All  of  the  WWTPs  are \nnonfunctional or only partially functional, and require investments for upgrade and renovation. \nThe project aims to use energy efficient and mechanized processes to treat approximately 45% of \nwastewater generated in the Kathmandu Valley in 2018 (treatment capacity of 90.5 MLD against \n200.0 MLD wastewater generated) in accordance with the long-term capital investment and asset \nmanagement program, approved by the government for prioritized year-wise investments in water \nsupply and wastewater infrastructure in the Kathmandu Valley.8 The project will help to reduce \npollution  of  the  Bagmati  River9  in  accordance  with  the  Bagmati  Action  Plan,10  and  will \ncomplement efforts at further improving river basin management under the proposed Bagmati \nRiver Basin Improvement Project.11  \n \n5.  Development partnerships. The efforts of the government and various development \npartners to improve urban services in the Kathmandu Valley have started to achieve the desired \nresults.12  Progress  on  the  Melamchi  tunnel  has  been  improving  despite  frequent  political \ndisturbances, institutional weaknesses, and poorly performing contractors, and the tunnel is likely \nto be completed in 2016. The ongoing Melamchi Water Supply Project (footnote 5) was adversely \naffected from 2000 to 2006 when several development partners withdrew because of the volatile \nsociopolitical situation and internal conflict in the country at the time. Investments in the project \nare necessary and timely to fully leverage the benefits of ongoing projects. \n \n6.  Lessons. The project was developed using lessons from previous ADB interventions and \nthe country assistance program evaluation, which pointed to the need for strategic, well-defined, \nand prioritized urban infrastructure investments.13  The implementation arrangements have been \nkept simple with a focus on using the institutional arrangements created under previous projects \nto ensure continued capacity building and sustainability. An important lesson from earlier projects \nis that stronger emphasis should be placed on the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing \ninfrastructure in parallel with the creation of new assets. Accordingly, the project will focus on \nimproving  the  existing  sewerage  network  and WWTPs.  Another  lesson  is  that  stakeholders \nshould  be  involved  from  the  early  stage  of  project  development;  the  project  has  provided \nadequate resources for participation of various stakeholders. Further, civil works packages have \nbeen kept sufficiently large to attract qualified international bidders. \n                                                \n6   Though the current average availability of water through KUKL is estimated at 100 MLD, availability varies widely \nand ranges from 70 MLD in the dry season to 140 MLD in the wet season.  \n7   There is no accurate assessment of the volume of wastewater generated. Estimating from water supply data from \nboth KUKL and private sources, average current wastewater generation is assessed as 75 MLD, and an additional \n125 MLD of wastewater is expected with the completion of the Melamchi tunnel.  \n8   The Capital Investment and Asset Management Program 2010\u20132025 was prepared with ADB assistance in 2010. \n9   The Bagmati River is considered a holy river by Hindus and Buddhists. Several Hindu temples are located on its \nbanks. \n10  The Bagmati Action Plan (2009\u20132014) was adopted by the government in August 2009 and is being implemented \nby the High Powered Committee for Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC). Zone 4 of this \nplan focuses on the urban area of the Kathmandu Valley and the components proposed in the project are \nconsistent with the plan. \n11  The project is being prepared through PPTA 8050-NEP: Preparing the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. \n12  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  ADB. 2009. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Nepal. Manila. ", "3 \n \n7.  Context in country programming. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Nepal country \npartnership strategy,14 which aims to support Nepal\u2019s peace and development aspirations by \npromoting the following four pillars: (i) broad-based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive \nsocial development, (iii) governance and capacity building, and (iv) climate change adaptation \nand environmental sustainability. The project fits into the priority water supply and other municipal \ninfrastructure and services sector, identified in the country partnership strategy, and will support \nthe country\u2019s peace and development through improved access to basic services. The project is \nincluded in the Nepal country operations business plan.15   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be sustainable wastewater management for the Kathmandu Valley. The \noutcome will be improved access to, and efficiency of, wastewater services for the residents of \nthe  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  project  will  further  consolidate  the  continuing  efforts  of  the \ngovernment and ADB in institutional development and improved governance of wastewater.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The  project  will  broadly  follow  the  priorities  identified  in  the  Conceptual Wastewater \nMasterplan,16 capital investment and asset management program (footnote 8), and the Bagmati \nAction Plan, and will be implemented in coordination with the Bagmati River Basin Improvement \nProject (footnote 11). The project outputs will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Sewerage  network  rehabilitated  and  expanded.  This  output  will \ninclude  (a)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  sewerage  network,  including \nproperty connections; (b) construction of interceptor sewers along the river banks; \nand (c) rehabilitation of sewage pumping stations. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Wastewater  treatment  plants  modernized  and  expanded.  This \noutput will include (a) modernization and expansion of five WWTPs to provide 90.5 \nMLD capacity, (b) energy generation through sludge digestion and gasification, \nand (c) decentralized wastewater treatment systems in low-income areas. Details \nof  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  systems  are  available  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).17  \n(iii)  Output  3:  Capacities strengthened  and  operational  and financial reforms \ninstitutionalized. This output will include continuation of the support provided \nthrough  ongoing  projects  for  (a)  capacity  building  of  KUKL,  KVWSMB,  and \nWSTFC; (b) development of a wastewater master plan, condition assessment of \nthe existing sewerage network, update of the sewerage connection database, \noperationalization of a sewerage geographic information system (GIS), and an \nasset  management  plan;  (c)  community  participation  and  public  education  for \nhealth,  hygiene,  and  behavior  change  in  water  conservation  and  wastewater \nmanagement practices, including the \"3Rs\" (reduce, reuse, and recycle); (d) a \ngender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan;  and  (e)  support  for  project \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2009.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n14.  Improvement of service delivery and regulation. The project will strengthen KUKL\u2019s \ncapacity  to  improve  its  wastewater  operations,  and  KVWSMB\u2019s  and  WSTFC\u2019s  respective \ncapacities as asset owner and regulator. KUKL will develop a proper organizational structure and \ndeploy  adequate  personnel  for  its  sewerage  operations  to  handle  additional  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) responsibilities.  \n ", "6 \n \n15.  Condition  assessment  survey,  geographic  information  system,  and  asset \nmanagement  plan.  The  project  will  support  KVWSMB  and  KUKL  to  carry  out  a  condition \nassessment survey and develop a sewerage GIS and an asset management plan, focusing on an \nintegrated approach to repairing, maintaining, rehabilitating, and replacing sewerage assets. \n \n16.  Adoption  of  energy  efficient  treatment  processes  and  energy  generation  from \nsludge. The existing WWTPs are located in densely populated areas and current processes are \ninefficient and ineffective.  Under the project, existing WWTPs will be upgraded  with energy \nefficient  and  mechanized  treatment  processes,  and  WWTP  designs  will  integrate  septage \nhandling facilities. To mitigate the problem of intermittent and unreliable power supply, the project \nwill facilitate (i) energy generation from sludge digestion or gasification, (ii) dedicated power \nsupply from the national grid, and (iii) standby diesel generator sets. \n \n17.  Operation  and  maintenance  embedded  construction  contracts  for  operational \nsustainability. The project will include O&M embedded construction contracts combining design, \nconstruction, and O&M for WWTPs for a sufficiently long period (5\u20137 years). This will mitigate \nKUKL\u2019s lack of O&M capacity, improve the quality of construction by providing continuity in \nsystem operation, and obligate KUKL to allocate adequate O&M budget.   \n \n18.  Separation of sanitary sewers from storm water drains. The Kathmandu Valley has a \ncombined  sewer  and  storm  water  drainage  system.  Various  reports  in  the  past  have \nrecommended separating these systems. The project will promote separation of storm water and \nsanitary sewer systems in most of the areas, while recognizing that complete separation is \ndifficult and impractical in some locations. \n \n19.  Integrated  planning  and  development  of  wastewater  treatment  plant  sites.  The \nproject will support integrated planning and development of WWTP sites and surrounding areas, \nespecially at Dhobighat, which will focus on (i) landscaping, plantation, and gardens; (ii) solid-\nwaste management; (iii) development of water bodies; and (iv) riverfront development including \neducational and recreational activities such as water sports, walkways, restaurants, etc.    \n \n20.  Links with Melamchi tunnel project. The project assumes the availability of 170 MLD \nwater from the Melamchi tunnel and assessment of current progress of the Melamchi tunnel \nindicates that it is likely to be completed by 2016 as per the updated plan. The government will \nmonitor progress of the Melamchi tunnel to ensure timely completion. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.6%; the \nnet present value is $24.6 million. The EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital, estimated at 12.0%, indicating sufficient economic return. The results from sensitivity \nanalysis, ranging from 13.4% to 14.5%, are satisfactory against downside risks, including 10% \nincrease in capital expenditure, 10% increase in operating costs, 10% decrease in benefits, and \n1-year delay in project completion. The EIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in beneficiaries. \nHigh population growth is likely to sustain demand for water supply and sanitation services.18   \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The estimated financial internal rate of return is 3.22%; the net \npresent value is NRs4,197 million ($47.7 million). The financial internal rate of return is higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital, estimated at 1.11%, indicating reasonable financial \nreturn.  The  results  from  sensitivity  analysis,  ranging  from  2.34%  to  3.03%,  are  satisfactory \n                                                \n18 Details are included in the economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nagainst downside risks, including capital cost overruns by 10%, O&M cost overruns by 10%, and \nrevenue reduced by 10%. The proposed water tariff and sewerage tariff sufficient to fully recover \nO&M costs are approximately 1.25% of income for low-income households, implying that the \nproject is also affordable for low-income households.19   \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The capacity building and public\u2013private partnership team will \nsupport KUKL focusing on (i) rationalization of tariffs; (ii) improvement of collection efficiency; (iii) \nrecovery of arrears with adequate provisioning for bad debts; (iv) computerization of operations \nand financial management; (v) improvement of cash management and use of banks; (vi) field \nverifications of house connections; and (vii) introduction of sewerage tariffs for big consumers \n(hotels, etc.) proportionate to the volume of wastewater discharged.   \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the PID. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). Risk assessment was made with the help of a tool \nspecifically  developed  for  Nepal.20  Based  on  these  assessments,  some  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures  incorporated  in  the  project  design  aim  to  (i)  establish  a  mechanism  for  regular \nvoluntary disclosure of project-related information to citizens; (ii) develop and update a project \nwebsite to enhance transparency in project implementation, procurement, and safeguards; and \n(iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective resolution. \n \n25.  Coordination with the High Powered Committee for Integrated Development of the \nBagmati  Civilization.  The  project  shares  the  vision  of  the  High  Powered  Committee  for \nIntegrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC) to improve the water quality in the \nBagmati River and its tributaries. Accordingly, under the project the WWTPs at Guheswori and \nGokarna will be rehabilitated to higher effluent standards to improve water quality upstream of the \nholy Pasupatinath Temple. Moreover, the project will coordinate with the HPCIDBC to develop \ncommon design standards for sewerage systems. \n \n26.  Coordination with other agencies for proper solid-waste management. Currently, \nsubstantial  quantities  of  solid  waste  are  dumped  in  the  Bagmati  River  and  its  tributaries, \naggravating  the  already  poor  quality  of  water  caused  by  disposal  of  untreated  sewage.  In \naddition, solid waste is frequently disposed of in sewers and manholes, causing blockages, \nflooding, and operational problems. The project will coordinate with municipalities and other \nagencies to improve solid-waste management through community awareness and participation. \n \n27.  Institutional  arrangements  of  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited.  The \ngovernment  will  refine  KUKL\u2019s  institutional  structure  to  enforce  its  accountability  to  the \ngovernment and citizens, and to ensure sustainability of its operations.       \n  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A poverty and social analysis \nhas been completed,21 and the project gives priority to connecting all poor  households and \nhouseholds headed by women to the sewerage network in the project area. The government and \nKUKL  will  reform  the  current  sewerage  connections  policy  to  facilitate  individual  sewerage \n                                                \n19  Details are included in the financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Peace Filter for Design and Implementation of Project (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in \nAppendix 2). \n21  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nconnections to the poor, socially excluded, and households headed by women. Connection fees \nwill be reduced for poor households under the project. A gender equality and social inclusion \naction  plan  was  prepared  with  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation.22  A \ncommunity awareness and participation plan has also been prepared under the project to involve \nkey stakeholders for widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation.23 The PID will implement \nthe gender equality and social inclusion and community awareness and participation plan, with \nsupport from the community awareness and participation consultant recruited under the project.  \n \n29.  Pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services.  Building  on  the  low-income \nconsumer service unit strategy developed by KUKL, the project will complement KUKL's ongoing \nefforts to further strengthen its pro-poor and gender-inclusive sanitation services by focusing on \n(i) implementing appropriate measures to make the Kathmandu Valley open-defecation free; (ii) \nstudy  of  past  sanitation  projects  in  low-income  consumer  areas,  including  decentralized \nwastewater treatment systems, and drawing applicable lessons from such sanitation projects; (iii) \nincorporating strategies for pro-poor and gender-sensitive sanitation services in KUKL's future \ninvestment plans and wastewater master plans; (iv) recording data on underserved settlements in \nthe GIS; and (v) piloting alternative onsite sanitation in selected low-income areas. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Social safeguards. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan24 and a resettlement framework25 were \nprepared  and  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and \nOperation Manual.26 The project does not include any component that will require land acquisition \nor resettlement activities causing any significant impact. All sites for the construction of WWTPs \nand sewerage network are located within existing WWTP sites or on government land along \nroads or riverbanks. The decentralized wastewater treatment systems shall be located in places \nthat do not require any land acquisition. Most of the land acquisition for the WWTPs was carried \nout during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The project will ensure that the land acquired for \nWWTPs continues to comply with all relevant laws and policies of the government. The impacts \nduring construction will be limited to (i) temporary losses for a few cultivators along the riverbanks \nduring the laying of sewers, (ii) temporary disruption of business activities and shifting of vendors \nand hawkers during construction works, and (iii) permanent loss of access to land for a few \ninformal  cultivators  at  the  Gokarna  WWTP  site.  The  compensation  for  lost  income  will  be \nprovided to those affected as per the resettlement plan and resettlement framework. No adverse \nimpacts on indigenous peoples are anticipated, and improved wastewater facilities will benefit all \nhouseholds including indigenous peoples in the project areas. The project will avoid cultural sites \nused by indigenous peoples, if identified during detailed design. Meaningful and widespread \nconsultations will continue with all communities in the project area. The government will initiate \nacquisition of land at Khokana for future construction of the WWTP. The project will support the \nstudy of technical and environmental feasibility and adequate protection of this site.   \n \n31.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified category B for environment. An \ninitial environmental examination (IEE)27 and environmental management plan were prepared \nand disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).

The IEE and the environmental management \nplan will be updated during detailed design and incorporated into contract documents. The IEE \nshows  substantive  net  positive  environmental  benefit,  including  (i)  improved  wastewater \nmanagement to safeguard public health, and (ii) cleaner waterways and urban environment \nthrough increased sewage treatment. Additional measures will be taken during pipe laying works \nwithin roads passing through heritage areas to ensure there are no impacts during construction. \nPermission from the Department of Archaeology will be obtained prior to commencement of \nconstruction,  particularly  in  Patan  and  Darbar  Squares.  Measures  to  manage  any  impacts \npertaining  to  slope  stability,  erosion,  and  sedimentation  will  be  implemented  prior  to  laying \ninterceptors along the rivers. As part of the detailed design of the new WWTPs, air quality \ndispersion modeling will be conducted to ensure odor management measures are incorporated \ninto the environmental monitoring system. In addition, perimeter buffers will be established along \nthe boundaries of the WWTPs to minimize odors released from the premises. To ensure optimal \noperations of WWTPs at all times, safety plans will be developed and implemented.29 \n \n32.  Environmental  monitoring  of  wastewater  quality.  The  project  will  support  the \ngovernment to monitor environmental regulatory standards. This will include development of (i) \ndomestic sewage discharge standards,30 (ii) a mechanism for monitoring the quality of discharge \nto  streams  and  rivers  in  the  valley,  (iii)  a  properly  equipped  laboratory,  (iv)  procedures for \nenforcement of pretreatment of industrial effluent before discharging to sewer network or stream, \n(v) a septage management plan, and (vi) processing and disposal of sludge and screenings.  \n \n33.  Natural disasters and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The project will \nincorporate  adequate  adaptation  measures  for  the  risks  related  to  earthquakes,  landslides, \nfloods, and climate change. The detailed designs of the project components will consider the \nfindings from ongoing strategic programs for climate resilience as basis for incorporating possible \nclimate change adaptation measures. These programs were funded by ADB and development \npartners through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience of the Climate Investment Funds.31 The \nproject will facilitate energy generation through the use of sludge produced and collected at \nWWTPs, which will help mitigate climate change impacts.   \n \nF.
