An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken,  and  the  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board of Directors and made public on \nthe  ADB  website  on  5  March  2004.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment  was  approved  by \nthe  Ministry  of  Nature  and \nEnvironment  on  12 May  2004  and  concluded  that  the  project  will \nhave no major adverse impacts on the environment. As there has \nbeen no change in scope or design, the approved environmental \nimpact assessment is still applicable.  \n \nThe  recent  global  financial  crisis  has  had  a  major  impact  on \nMongolia's  economic  performance  and  fiscal  position  due  to  the \ncollapse  of  international  commodity  prices.  Real  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth is projected to shrink from 8.9% in 2008 to \n2.7% in 2009. The current account balance changed dramatically, \nfrom a surplus of 6.7% of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 9.6% of GDP \nin  2008,  and  gross  official  international  reserves  fell  from \n$1,001 million  in  2007  to  $657  million  in  2008.  The  general \ngovernment deficit was 5% of GDP in 2008, with a target of 6% in \n2009.  Despite  balance  of  payment  support  from  the  International \nMonetary  Fund  and  government  capital  expenditure  cuts,  the \ngovernment is still in need of $205 million in 2009\u20132010 to finance \nits budget. \n \nApproved in June 2004, the Regional Road Development Project \nis  experiencing  a  cost  overrun  due  to  a  combination  of  factors, \nincluding  cost  underestimation,  implementation  delay,  and  high \ninflation. It will not be possible to complete the 428 kilometer (km) \nroad  construction  from  Choyr  to  the  border  with  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  near  Zamyn-Uud  without  supplementary \nfinancing.   \n \nThe  supplementary  financing  will  provide  the  government  with \ntimely  support  to  help  mitigate  the  effect  of  the  financial  crisis, \nimpact  of  expenditure  cutbacks  on \nalleviate \nemployment, \nlong-term  development \nprospects, and achieve the original objectives of the project. \n \nCompletion  of  the  project  will  also  increase  the  economic  impact \nroad  projects  connecting \nof \n\ntwo  previous  ADB-financed \n\nimprove  Mongolia's \n\nthe  negative \n\n\fii \n \n\n \n\n \nInvestment Plan for the \nSupplementary Loan and \nGrant \n \nFinancing Plan for the \nSupplementary Loan and \nGrant \n\n \nSupplementary Loan and \nGrant Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nMongolia's  major  economic  centers  with  the  Russian  Federation. \nSupplementary  financing  is  justified  under  ADB's  Operations \nManual section on supplementary financing. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  supplementary  loan  and  grant  is \nestimated  at  $25.64  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$1.64 million. \n\nTotal Amount \n($ million) \n\nPercent \n(%) \n31 \n63 \n6 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n     Total \n\n8.00 \n16.00 \n1.64 \n 25.64 \n\nSource \nADB loan \nADB grant \nGovernment of Mongolia \n  \nADB = Asian Development Bank \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nThe government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent \nto $8 million and a grant equivalent to $16 million from its Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  proposed  loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the draft financing agreement.

A  project  steering  committee,  comprising  representatives \nof central government agencies and local governments, is already \nestablished.  It  will  continue  to  supervise  project  implementation \nunder the proposed supplementary loan and grant.  \n \nOne civil works package for a 62 km road section will be procured \nunder \nin \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \ninternational \namended \nfrom \ncompetitive  bidding  using \ntwo-envelope \nprocedure. \n \nThe government has requested ADB's approval of advance action \nto  cover  invitation  for  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  limited \ncontract awards.

Using  a  12%  discount \nrate, the net present value is $21.3 million. The economic rate of \nreturn \nfinancing  will  enable \ncompletion of the project, which will benefit about 10,500 people, \naround  21.6%  of  whom  are  poor,  and  will  improve  connectivity \nand access to social services.  \n \nThe  following  risks  have  been  considered  in  formulating  the \nsupplementary financing: cost overrun, implementation delay, and  \nnoncompletion  of  the  176  km  road  section  to  be  financed  by  the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). \n \nThe  risk  of  cost  overrun  has  been  mitigated  by  basing  the  cost \nestimates  on  the  detailed  engineering  design,  updating  the  costs \nto  the  2009  price  level,  and  using  relatively  high-cost  escalation \nfactors.  The  other  two  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  procuring \npackage NP2 using international competitive bidding single-stage, \ntwo-envelope procurement procedure, with advance procurement \naction and retroactive financing; and (ii) coordinating closely with \nthe MCC to support the implementation of the MCC-financed road \nsection. \n\niii\n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nMONGOLIA\nREGIONAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nt\no\n \n\nN\n\no\n\nv\n\no\n\ns\n\nbir\n\ns\n\nk\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaanbayshint\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nNogoonnuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\nSelenge\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nHOVD\n\nTakeshiken\n\nYarant\n\nTayshir\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nUyench\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nArvayheer\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nULAANBAATAR\nLun\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBaganuur\n\nBatnorov\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nTOV\nZuunmod\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nChoyr\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nSaynshand\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\n6\n\n2 k\n\nm\n\nto B\n\neijin\n\ng\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\n62 km Road Section to be financed \nunder the supplementary loan/grant\n\nRoad\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nWestern Region\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nADB-Financed Road\nunder Loan 2087-MON\n\nADB-Financed Road (completed projects)\n\nADB-Financed Road (other ongoing project)\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\nto Urumqi\n\n42  00'No\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n9\n-\n3\n1\n7\n6\na\n \nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\n\fo\n109   00'E\n\nCHOYR\n\nMONGOLIA\nREGIONAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n106  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nRUSSIAN  FEDERATION\n\no\n46  00'N\n\no\n46  00'N\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nAyrag\n\nN\n\n25\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n50\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\n48  00'No\n\nORHON\n\n48  00'No\n\nHENTIY\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nAtar\n\nZuunmod\n\nTOV\n\nMaanit\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nNalayh\n\nOndorhaan\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nBaruun Urt\n\nChoyr\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nDalanzadgad\n\n62 km\n\n42  00'No\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\n42  00'No\n\nSAYNSHAND\n\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n106  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nLoan 1364-MON (SF): \nRoads Development Project\n\nLoan 1700-MON (SF):\nSecond Roads Development Project\n\nLoan 2087-MON:\nRegional Road Development Project\n\n62 km Road Section to be financed\nunder the supplementary loan/grant\n\nPaved Road\n\nProposed Access Road\n\nRailway\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nHamrlin Monastery\n\nZuunbayan\n\nOrgon\n\nErdene\n\nHanginuur Pass\n\no\n109   00'E\n\no\n111  00'E\n\no\n44  00'N\n\n0\n9\n-\n3\n1\n7\n6\nb\n \nH\nR\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\n6\n\n2\n \nk\n\nm\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\no\n44  00'N\n\nM\na\np\n \n2\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  and  grant  both  to  Mongolia  for  the  Regional  Road  Development  Project. \nThe revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nProject Rationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nA  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  Board  of  Directors,  approved  in  July  2004,  established  the  rationale  for  the  project.1 \nMongolia  is  the  second  largest  landlocked  country  in  the  world.  Transport  in  Mongolia  was \ncostly  and  difficult  and  a  major  reason  for  this  was  that  the  road  sector  was  underdeveloped. \nThe 49,250 kilometers (km) road network comprised 11,063 km of state roads and 38,187 km of \nlocal roads. Only 12% of these were paved, 13% were gravel roads, and 75% were earth roads. \nThe proportion of paved roads and the overall road density (0.03 km per square kilometer [km2]) \nwere  very  low  compared  with  other  countries.  Moreover,  due  to  inadequate  maintenance,  the \ncondition  of  many  paved  and  gravel  roads  was  deteriorating  and  a  large  portion  were \nimpassable during the rainy or winter seasons.  \n \n3. \nThe  underdeveloped  road  network  had  seriously  constrained  the  country's  access  to \nforeign  markets.  Mongolia  depended  on  external  trade  with  its  two  neighbors\u2014the  People's \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  Russian  Federation\u2014which  are  also  two  major  sources  of \nforeign direct investment. In particular, the PRC was Mongolia's largest source of foreign direct \ninvestment, its largest export market, and its second-largest source of imports (after the Russian \nFederation). Mongolia also used the port of Tianjin in the PRC, the closest seaport, for market \naccess  to  the  United  States  and  other  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  majority  of \nMongolia's  external  trade  was  carried  on  the  existing  north\u2013south  railway  line,  which  provided \nthe transport connection between Suhbaatar at the northern border with the Russian Federation \nand  the  southern  border  with  the  PRC  near  Zamyn-Uud.  While  the  railway  was  suitable  for \ncarrying long-haul and bulk cargos, it was less flexible and responsive to the needs of private \ntraders for smaller freight and over shorter distances. Railway transport was also subject to the \nproblem of different gauges being used in Mongolia and the PRC.   \n \n4. \nThe  inadequate  road  network  hindered  investment  and  job  creation  and  limited \ncommunities' access to markets and social services. At the time of approving the project loan, \nMongolia was a poor country, with 35.6% of the population living in poverty and per capita gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of $505. About 57% of the population was aged 25 years or younger. \nThe  project  feasibility  study  showed  that  about  10,500  people,  around  21.6%  of  whom  were \nliving  in  poverty.  Poverty  was  largely  income-based  and  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  job \nopportunities (18.4% unemployment rate) (footnote 1). \n \n5. \nThe government's road sector strategy aimed to improve the efficiency of road transport \nto facilitate the country's economic and social development. The strategy focused on (i) creating \na  favorable  environment  for  developing  a  competitive  road  transport  industry,  (ii)  increasing \ninvestment  on  road  construction  and  rehabilitation  to  reduce  Mongolia's  isolation  from  world \nmarkets and improve the accessibility of isolated communities within the country, (iii) increasing \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project. Manila (Loan 2087-MON, approved on \n22 July). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nfunding for road maintenance, (iv) improving the efficiency of state-owned transport enterprises, \nand (v) improving road safety.  \n \nADB's country strategy was to foster pro-poor economic growth to reduce poverty.2 The \n6. \nstrategy  focused  on  support  for  (i)  creating  an  environment  conducive  to  private-sector-led \ngrowth,  (ii)  generating  employment,  (iii)  maintaining  standards  of  human  development,  (iv) \nstrengthening  and  reforming  the  social  protection  system,  and  (v)  undertaking  governance \nreforms.  Developing  the  road  sector  was  among  the  strategic  focuses  of  ADB  operations. \nCompletion of the north\u2013south road corridor was considered a high priority.  \n \n7. \n The project would complement ADB's previous support for paving road sections along \npart  of  the  north\u2013south  corridor  linking  Altanbulag  at  the  Russian  Federation  border  with \nUlaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, by extending the road corridor south to the border with the \nPRC.3 It would complete the first modern highway between Mongolia's economic centers and its \nmain  trading  partners,  and  thereby  significantly  increase  the  country's  capacity  to  access \nexternal  markets  and  further  develop  its  economy  and  reduce  poverty.  The  approved  project \nwas considered financially sustainable and economically viable with a 29.7% economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) at the appraisal stage. \n\n \nObjective and Scope  \n\nB. \n \n8. \nThe  objective  of  the  project  was  to  promote  regional  cooperation  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  Mongolia  by  increasing  transport  efficiency  and  safety  for  domestic  and \ninternational traffic on Mongolia's north\u2013south road corridor. The project had five components: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nConstruction of the project road. Under the project, a 428 km paved road from \nChoyr  to  the  border  with  the  PRC  near  Zamyn-Uud  would  be  constructed.  The \nChoyr\u2013Zamyn-Uud  section  would  be  a  two-lane  paved  road  with  7.0  meter  (m) \nwide pavement and 1.5 m shoulders. The section between Zamyn-Uud and the \nborder  with  the  PRC  would  be  a  four-lane  paved  road  with  14.0  m  wide \npavement and 2.0 m shoulders.  \n \nCross-border road transport facilitation plan. Consulting services of $230,000 \nto  be  provided  under  the  project  would  assist  the  government  to  (a) develop  a \ntransit traffic framework agreement with the PRC and the Russian Federation, (b) \nestablish  regulations  on  cross-border  vehicles  according \ninternational \nstandards, (c) negotiate with the PRC on increased access of Mongolian vehicles \nto  PRC  territory,  (d)  collect  vehicle  fees  for  road  maintenance,  (e) improve  the \nroad  between  Zamyn-Uud  and  the  border  with  the  PRC,  (f) enforce  vehicle \nweight  control,  and  (g)  establish  emergency  services \nfor  vehicles  and \npassengers traveling on the north\u2013south road corridor. \n \nRoad safety improvement. This component comprised (a) installing road safety \nfeatures on the Altanbulag\u2013Ulaanbaatar section, (b) an independent road safety \naudit of the detailed design of the project, (c) distributing pamphlets and posters \non  road  safety  to  raise  public  awareness,  (d)  procuring  two  patrol  vehicles \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2003.

This  component  comprised  (a)  constructing \naccess  roads  totaling  40.5  km,  (b)  establishing  roadside  stations,  (c)  training \nlocal  laborers  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  (d)  stakeholder \nparticipation.  \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nAwareness  and  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  A  technical \nassistance (TA) grant of $350,000 was provided to mitigate the risk of HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking along the project road.  \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  project,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during  construction,  was  estimated  to \ncost  $78.14  million  equivalent.  ADB  provided  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR25,505,000 ($37.13 million) from ADB's Special Funds resources, financing 50% of the civil \nworks cost and 47.5% of the total project cost. The ADB loan was provided over 32 years, with \na  grace  period  of  8  years  and  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n10. \nThe Economic Development Cooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea (EDCF Korea) \nand  the  PRC  cofinanced  the  project  road  on  a  parallel  basis.  The  fund  extended  a  loan  of \n$23.88 million equivalent on concessional terms to finance 30.6% of the total project cost. The \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  provided  a  grant  of  $1.5  million  equivalent  to \nfinance 1.9% of the total project cost; this was subsequently increased to $3.2 million.  \n \nIn February 2007, ADB increased the loan amount to SDR28,343,456.86 by transferring \n11. \nto  the  project  the  surplus  loan  proceeds  of  SDR2,838,456.86  (about  $4.5  million  equivalent) \nfrom the completed Second Roads Development Project. This was to partly offset a shortfall in \nthe financing plan, as bid prices for civil works were much higher than originally estimated. The \noriginal project cost estimate and financing plan, and the 2007 update, are shown in Table 1. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nTable 1: Project Cost and Financing Plan\u2014Original Estimate and 2007 Revision  \n($ million) \n\n \n\nOriginal \n\nRevised, 2007 \n\nItem \nA.

As  of  30  September  2009,  overall  progress  of  project \n12. \nimplementation  was  estimated  at  42.4%,  compared  to  the  loan  elapsed  period  of  95%.  As  of \n1 December  2009,  the  cumulative  actual  contract  awards  totaled  $37.21  million,  while \ncumulative actual disbursements were $21.97 million. The project performance report rated the \noverall project implementation progress partly satisfactory because the delay in implementation \nwas more than 40% compared with the original appraisal schedule. On 3 December 2009, ADB \napproved  an  extension  of  the  loan  closing  date  by  24  months  from  1 January  2010  to  31 \nDecember 2011. The status of the implementation of individual project components is described \nin paras. 13\u201328.  \n \n\nPart A: Construction of the Project Road  \n\n1. \n \nConstruction  of  the  428  km  road  was  cofinanced  by  EDCF  Korea  and  the  PRC.  The \n13. \ndivision of responsibility was that (i) EDCF Korea would finance the 176 km section from Choyr \nto  8  km  before  the  35th  railway  crossing  (package  A),  (ii)  ADB  would  finance  the  252.4  km \nsection  from  8  km  before  the  35th  railway  crossing  to  Zamyn-Uud,  and  (iii)  the  PRC  would \nfinance the 3.3 km section from Zamyn-Uud to the border with the PRC.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nOriginally, the ADB-financed section was to be a single contract package for 252.4 km. \n14. \nIn  2005,  it  was  split  into  two  packages  (B1  and  B2)  to  encourage  competition  and  speed  up \nconstruction.  The  results  of  the  bidding  in  October  2006  indicated  that  the  lowest  evaluated \nresponsive  bid  price  was  $26.24  million  for  package  B1  and  $31.17  million  for  package  B2. \nAccording to the financing plan in the 2004 RRP (footnote 1), the available financial resources \nfor  both  packages  (excluding  contingency  allocation  from  both  ADB  and  the  government)  was \nonly  $26.82  million.  Consequently,  the  government  and  ADB  decided  to  award  B1  and \nsubdivide  and  rebid  package  B2  in  two  packages  (NP1  and  NP2),  with  the  government  to \nfinance NP2 in its entirety. \n \n15. \nAs the project area is semiarid and sparsely vegetated steppe, there are plans to plant \nvegetation along the project road. As the civil works construction work is ongoing, planting has \nbeen deferred.  \n \n\nPackage A Financed by EDCF Korea \n\na. \n \n\nThe contract with a value of $31 million was signed on 4 April 2007. Since the funding \n16. \nprovided by EDCF Korea was only $23.9 million, the government agreed to finance the balance \nof  the  contract  amount.  Construction  commenced  in  June  2007  and  was  expected  to  be \ncompleted  by  the  end  of  October  2008.  However,  in  mid-2008,  after  8% implementation \nprogress, the contractor requested additional financing on the basis of input price increases and \ndepreciation of the won, and stopped all construction activities and withdrew its workforce. The \ngovernment  did  not  accept  the  request  and  decided  to  use  EDCF  Korea  funds  for  a  different \nproject.  Instead,  the  government  requested  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC)  to \nfinance this section, which approved a grant of $47.2 million on 9 December 2009. \n \n\nb. \n\nPackage B1 under ADB Funding \n\n \nThe  contract  for  $24.04  million  for  construction  of  the  131.3  km  road  section  from  the \n17. \n35th railway  crossing  to  the  18th  Khudag  of  Choyr\u2013Saynshand\u2013Zamyn-Uud  was  signed  on \n28 December  2006.  Construction  commenced  on  21  January  2007  and  was  scheduled  for \ncompletion by 31  October 2008. As of 30 September 2009, cumulative physical progress was \nestimated at 59%. In May 2008, the contractor requested a price adjustment and then withdrew \npart of the workforce. In view of the double-digit inflation in 2007 and 2008, and substantial price \nincreases  in  road  construction  materials,  the  government  negotiated  a  one-time  price \nadjustment of $3 million to the existing contract and has requested ADB to finance this from the \nproposed supplementary financing. The contractor has agreed to restart construction in March \n2010 and complete the works by October 2010.  \n \n\nc. \n\nPackage NP1 under ADB Funding \n\n \n18. \nADB  approved  the  award  of  the contract  for  the  construction  of  the  62.2  km  road  from \nthe 18th Khudag to the 62.2 kilometer post on 22 February 2008. The contract for $11.38 million \nwas  signed  on  16  April  2008.  Work  commenced  in  May  2008  and  was  to  be  completed  by \n30 June 2009. The cumulative physical progress of civil works as of the end of July 2009 was \nestimated at 10.2% and completion is expected by October 2010. The contractor has submitted \na price adjustment claim but not slowed down its work. Similar to the case of package B1, the \ngovernment has negotiated a one-time price adjustment of $0.78 million and requested ADB to \ncover the additional expenses from the proposed supplementary financing.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nd. \n\nPackage NP2 under Government Funding \n\n \n\n \n19. \nThe  cost  of construction  of  this  62  km  road  section  was  to be  met  by  the  government. \nThe  government  twice  attempted  to  award  the  contract  on  deferred  payment  terms  without \nsuccess.  Subsequently,  as  a  result  of  the  recent  financial  crisis,  and  having  entered  into  a \nstand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2009, the government \nhas had to cut public expenditure, and is no longer able to finance this section. It has requested \nADB  to  take  over  financing  of  this  contract  package  through  the  proposed  supplementary \nfinancing.  \n \n\ne. \n\nCivil Work Package under People\u2019s Republic of China Funding \n\n \nThe construction of the road from Zamyn-Uud to the state border (3.3 km) through grant \n20. \nfunding provided by the PRC was successfully completed in October 2005. The total cost of the \ncompleted  road  was  $3.2  million,  compared  with  an  appraisal  estimate  of  $1.5  million.  The \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  provided  the  additional  funds  required  to \ncomplete this road section.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Implementation of a Cross-Border Road Transport Facilitation Plan   \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Road Safety Improvement \n\n \nThe  cross-border  facilitation  plan  was  approved  on  19  January  2005.  A  tripartite \n21. \nagreement  with  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  PRC  is  under  negotiation,  and  bilateral \nagreements  are  regularly  updated.  To  assist  the  government  in  implementing  the  plan,  a \nconsulting firm will be recruited in the 2nd quarter of 2010 (to provide 10 international person-\nmonths and 16 national person-months of consulting services). \n \n \n \nTwo  individual  consultants  (one  international  and  one  national)  were  recruited  in \n22. \nOctober 2007 to jointly audit the road safety aspects of the detailed design of the project road \nand  the  Ulaanbaatar\u2013Altanbulag  road.  The  final  report  was  submitted  on  25  April  2008. \nSubsequently,  a  contract  was  awarded  in  September  2008  to  implement  the  road  safety \nimprovements of the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Altanbulag road. The contract was successfully completed by \nthe end of the 3rd quarter of 2009.   \n \n23. \nAn  international  consultant  will  be  recruited  for  2  person-months  to  train  traffic  police \nofficers  on  traffic  regulations  3  months  prior  to  the  completion  of  road  construction  work. \nTogether with this training, distribution of pamphlets and posters on road safety to raise public \nawareness  is  also  planned.  Procurement  of  vehicles  and  two-way  communication  radios  is \nplanned to take place in parallel with road opening in 2012.   \n \n\n4. \n\nPart D: Area Development \n\n \n \n24. \nTo  facilitate  movement  of  people  and  goods  between  towns  in  the  project  area,  four \naccess  roads  totaling  40.5  km  were  to  be  constructed  under  the  project.  In  September  2008, \nADB  approved  the  award  of  contract  package  AR1  for  construction  of  a  15.5  km  access  road \nfrom  the  project  main  road  to  Erdene  Soum.  However,  in  view  of  the  financing  shortfall  of  the \nproject,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  did  not  consent  to  awarding  the  contract.  As  the  bidding  was \ncarried  out  in  early  2008,  the  government  has  requested  ADB's  approval  for  rebidding  this \npackage. Adequate funds are available under the existing loan to finance package AR1 and the \ncontract package will continue to be financed under the existing loan.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nFor package AR2, to construct an 18.25 km access road from the main road to Orgon \n25. \nSoum,  the  executing  agency  signed  the  contract  for  $2.0  million  on  24  January  2008. \nConstruction commenced in March 2008 and is expected to be completed by August 2010. The \ncontractor  has  submitted  a  price  adjustment  claim,  and,  similar  to  packages  B1  and  NP1,  the \ngovernment has negotiated a one-time price adjustment of $0.18 million.  \n \n26. \nThe Road Supervision Research Center conducted the first batch of the training program \nfor  20  construction  workers  and  40  semi-skilled  equipment  operators  from  1  March  to \n30 April 2007.  The  second  batch  of  the  training  program  is  planned  to  be  undertaken  before \n2011.  \n \n27. \nStakeholder  participation  will  commence  after  additional  financial  arrangements  for  the \nconstruction of all road sections of the main road have been finalized. A consulting firm will be \nrecruited  to  help  the  government  to  continue  the  stakeholder  participation  process  providing \ntraining  for  small  enterprises,  skills  development,  and  support  for  vulnerable  groups. \nConsultations will start in April 2010 and stakeholder participation discussions will be conducted \non an intermittent basis until the end of 2010.  \n \n\nPart E: Awareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\n5. \n \nTo  help  mitigate  the  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  and  human  trafficking \n28. \nalong  the  north\u2013south  corridor  after  project  completion,  ADB  provided  TA  for  Awareness  and \nPrevention of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking for $350,000 (footnote 1). The Ministry of Health \nwas the executing agency for the TA. Four individual consultants (one international consultant \nfor  2 person-months  and  three national  consultants  for  57  person-months)  with  expertise  in \nhuman \ntrafficking,  health  education  and  advocacy,  HIV/AIDS  medical  services,  and \nepidemiological  surveillance  and  monitoring  were  recruited.  Consultants  under  the  TA \ncommenced services on 1 January 2006 and activities were completed in July 2009.  \n \n\n6. \n\nCompliance with Loan Covenants \n\n \nThe loan covenants have been or are being complied with,4 except for implementation of \n29. \nthe  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation  plan.  The  compliance  status  of  the  project  loan \ncovenants  is  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  transit  transport  agreement  between \nMongolia,  the  PRC,  and  the  Russian  Federation  has  not  been  finalized  and  may  take  longer \nthan  expected.  The  Government  of  the  Russian  Federation  has  indicated  that  the  draft \nagreement  needs  to  be  renegotiated.  Bilateral agreements  are  already  in  place  and  the  traffic \nforecast  does  not  depend  on  the  tripartite  agreement.  Hence,  the  absence  of  a  tripartite \nagreement will not adversely affect the project. \n \n\n7.  \n\nStrength and Weaknesses of the Project \n\n \n30. \nThe project road is a lifeline for Mongolia, and the government has accorded the highest \npriority to the project. Completion of the project road will (i) increase the economic impact of the \nprevious support of the government and ADB for connecting the main economic and population \ncenters  in  Mongolia  with  both  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  PRC;  (ii)  strengthen  economic \nties between Mongolia and those countries; (iii) increase the flexibility, efficiency, and reliability \n\n                                                 \n4   Project  steering  committee  meetings  were  only  held  once  in  2005  and  2006.  ADB  noted  this  in  its  loan  review \nmission in 2006 and requested the government to adhere to the loan covenant (at least once every 6 months). This \ncovenant was complied with in 2007 and 2008. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nof Mongolia's transport system; and (iv) enable Mongolia to tap economic opportunities offered \nby other countries in the region.   \n \n31. \nThe main weaknesses of the project are that (i) it was approved using the cost estimates \nbased  on  the  design  parameters  for  typical  sections,  without  detailed  information  on  the \ntopographic  and  geotechnical  conditions  of  the  project  road,  and  this  has  contributed  to  cost \nunderestimation  and  to  the  financing  shortfall  for  the  project;  and  (ii)  it  has  experienced \nimplementation  delays  during  both  procurement  and  contract  implementation  and,  taking  into \naccount  the  very  short  construction  season  in  Mongolia,  this  exposed  the  project  to  cost \nescalation pressures during the recent period of very high inflation in Mongolia.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN AND GRANT \n\nCost Overrun and Financing Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n32. \nCost  overrun.  The  supplementary  financing  is  proposed  due  to  cost  overrun.  The \nupdated cost of civil works for the project is estimated to be $115.46 million in 2009 prices, and \nthe total project is estimated to cost $141.90 million. This represents a 114% increase over the \noriginal cost estimate of $53.97 million for civil works and an 82% increase over the original total \nproject cost estimate of $78.14 million.  \n \n33. \nThe  cost  overrun  is  attributable  to  two  major  factors:  cost  underestimation,  and \nimplementation  delay  combined  with  high  inflation.  The  cost  estimates  in  the  2004  RRP  were \nbased  on  very  preliminary  engineering  design  at  the  feasibility  study  stage,  relying  on  rough \nestimates of work items and quantities. Consequently, this led to major differences between the \nfeasibility and detailed design stages in terms of the work items and quantities, which are major \ncost factors. These are estimated to account for an increase of $27.14 million in civil works cost \nfor the Choyr\u2013Zamyn-Uud section (Appendix 2).  \n\n \n34. \nVery high inflation during the project implementation period accounts for the remainder \nof the cost overrun. The annual increase in Mongolia's consumer price index was 9.6% in 2005, \n5.9%  in  2006,  14.1%  in  2007,  and  23.1%  in  2008.5 The  prices  of  the  main  road  construction \nmaterials  soared.  For  example,  between  2006  and  2008,  the  price  of  bitumen  increased  by \n117%, the price of diesel rose by 154%, and the price of petrol rose by 193%. \n \n35. \nThe  problem  of  high  inflation  was  exacerbated  by  delays  in  project  implementation, \nwhich  meant  that  civil  works  contracts  were  awarded  later  than  scheduled  and  their \nimplementation  has  taken  longer  than  expected.  Bidders  have  quoted  higher  prices,  and \ncontractors  have  sought  contract  price  escalations  when  implementation  was  delayed  for \nreasons beyond their control. According to the original implementation schedule, the contract for \nthe ADB-financed section was to be awarded in the fourth quarter of 2005, and construction was \nto  commence  in  the  second  quarter  of  2006  and  be  completed  by  October  2009. Contract  B1 \nwas  awarded  in  December  2006,  contract  NP1  was  awarded  in  April  2008,  contract  AR2  was \nawarded in January 2008, and contracts NP2 and AR1 have not yet been awarded. Contracts \nB1,  NP1,  and  AR2  are  expected  to  be  completed  in  2010,  but  contract  NP2  will  not  be \ncompleted  until  the  end  of  2012,  and  contract  AR1  will  not  be  completed  until  October  2011. \nOverall,  completion  of  the  project  road  will  be  3.5  years  behind  the  original  schedule.  The \ncontractors  for  packages  A,  NP1,  and  AR2  have  cited  various  sources  of  delays  that  were \n                                                 \n5  Inflation  based  on  the  consumer  price  index  peaked  in  August  2008  at  34.2%.

Inflation based on the consumer price index is forecast at 7% in 2010, \n5.5% in 2011, and 5.5% in 2012. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nImpact on the Project \n\nbeyond  their  control,  including  delays  in  issuing  work  permits,  delays  in  customs  clearance  of \nconstruction equipment, late payment, and changes in engineering designs. Such delays had a \nheightened impact because of the short duration of the annual construction season in Mongolia.   \n \nFinancing  scope.  The supplementary financing will cover (i) the remaining 62 km road \n36. \nsection  (NP2),  which  the  government  is  no  longer  able  to  finance  following  the  financial  crisis \nand  having  entered  into  a  stand-by  arrangement  with  the  IMF; 6  (ii) price  adjustments  for \ncontracts  B1,  NP1,  and  AR2;  and  (iii)  related  additional  project  administration  costs  such  as \nsalaries and office expenses, which were financed under the main loan.  \n \n37. \nAlthough contracts B1, NP1, and AR2 are fixed-price contracts, the government wishes \nto  settle  the  contractors\u2019  claims  amicably  due  to  the  following:  (i)  prices  of  main  road \nconstruction  materials  increased  sharply  due  to  high  inflation  in  Mongolia  in  2007  and  2008 \n(para. 34 and Appendix 2); and (ii) termination of contracts may result in lengthy legal disputes \nand  will  further  delay  completion  of  the  project  roads.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to \nfinance the price adjustment under the supplementary financing. In parallel with the processing \nof  the  supplementary  financing,  the  approval  of  the  ADB  Procurement  Committee  has  been \nsought with respect to contract variations for the price adjustments, in accordance with an ADB \nmemorandum on price adjustments in ADB-financed contracts due to high inflation.7  \n \nB. \n \n38. \nThe  cost  overrun  since  2005  has  seriously  hampered  the  construction  of  the  project \nroad, a major component of the project. After entering into a stand-by arrangement with the IMF, \nthe government is no longer able to finance package NP2 that covers the 62 km section of the \nnorth\u2013south  road  corridor.  The  cost  overrun  also  threatens  completion  of  two  of  the  other \npackages that form part of the corridor (package B1, 131.1 km; and package NP1, 62.2 km), as \nwell  as  one  of  the  access  roads  (package  AR2,  18.25  km).  The  contractors  for  these  three \npackages have filed claims for additional payment, and the government has agreed to pay an \nadditional $3 million to the B1 contractor, $766,725 to the NP1 contractor, and $178,758 to the \nAR2 contractor. However, the original loan will not be able to finance these contract variations. If \nthese variations are not approved, the likely consequence would be termination of the contracts \nby the contractors without completing the works.  \n \n39. \nPackage  AR1  has  already  been  adversely  affected  by  the  financing  shortfall.  Although \nthe bidding process was completed and ADB endorsed the contract award in September 2008, \nthe government did not want to award the contract until additional financing is secured. \n \n40. \nThe  supplementary  financing  will  enable  the  government  to  complete  the  project  and \nrealize  the  benefits  of  establishing  a  modern  highway  link  enabling  efficient  transportation \nbetween Mongolia's economic centers and its main trading partners. These benefits will not be \nrealized if the civil works of contracts B1, NP1, NP2, AR1, and AR2 are not completed.    \n \nC. \n \n41. \nDependent on mineral exports, Mongolia's economy and fiscal position are vulnerable to \nexogenous  shocks.  The  recent  global  financial  crisis  caused  a  sharp  fall  in  the  prices  of \nMongolia's  major  export  commodities.  Most  notably  in  2009,  the  price  of  copper  dropped  by \n                                                 \n6  IMF. 2009. Request for Stand-By Arrangement. Washington, DC.  \n7  ADB  Central  Operations  Services  Office  memo  of  26  August  2008  on  Price  Adjustments  in  ADB-Financed \n\nRationale \n\nContracts Due to High Inflation.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n60%  from  the  2008  level.  This  had  a  major  impact  on  Mongolian  economic  performance  and \naggravated its balance of payments and fiscal imbalances. Real GDP growth was projected to \nshrink from 8.9% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2009. The current account balance changed dramatically \nfrom a surplus of 6.7% of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 9.6% of GDP in 2008, and gross official \ninternational  reserves  fell  from  $1,001  million  in  2007  to  $657  million  in  2008.  The  general \ngovernment deficit was 5% of GDP in 2008, with a target of 6% in 2009. Despite IMF support \nand the government's substantial adjustment of the fiscal position by reducing expenditure and \nincreasing  revenue,  financing  of  the  budget  remains  difficult,  and  about  $205 million  in  2009\u2013\n2010 will be required from other sources.8   \n \n42. \nThe  supplementary  financing  will  provide  the  government  with  timely  support  to  help \nmitigate the effect of the financial crisis, alleviate the negative impact of the expenditure outlook \non employment, improve Mongolia's long-term development prospects, and achieve the original \nobjectives of the project.  \n \n43. \nCompletion  of  the  Choyr\u2013Zamyn-Uud  road  corridor  with  additional  financial  resources \nfrom  ADB  will  also  increase  the  economic  impact  of  the  two  previous  ADB-financed  road \nprojects, and deepen regional integration. Since 1995, ADB has been supporting a sequenced \nimprovement  of  the  north\u2013south  regional  transport  corridor  which  forms  part  of  the  Asian \nHighway  Network  and  is  a  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  priority  corridor.  The \nRoads  Development  Project  (footnote  3)  financed  construction  of  a  312  km  paved  road  from \nUlaanbaatar  to  Altanbulag  (border  with  the  Russian  Federation),  and  the  Second  Roads \nDevelopment  Project  (footnote  3)  financed  construction  of a  220 km  paved  national  road from \nNalayh to Choyr. The project is a continuation of this road and will extend it to the border with \nthe PRC. Completion of this 1,000 km trunk road will generate more economic opportunities for \nMongolia,  and  benefit  other  countries  in  the  region,  especially  the  PRC  and  the  Russian \nFederation.  Furthermore,  the  project  road  is  a  prerequisite  for  proposed  ADB  development \nactivities  such  as  the  Regional  Logistics  Development  Project9 and  the  Southeast  Gobi  Urban \nand Border Town Development Project10 in Zamyn-Uud.  \n \n44. \nthe  Operations  Manual  section  on \njustified  under \nsupplementary financing, which states that ADB may provide supplementary financing to cover \na  financing  gap  or  a  cost  overrun  on  an  ADB-financed  project,  provided  that  (i)  the  project \ncontinues  to  be  a  priority  in  the  government\u2019s  development  strategy,  and  (ii)  supplementary \nfinancing will help achieve the original project objectives and benefits.11  \n \nD. \n \n45. \nCosts  to  be  financed  by  the  supplementary  loan  and  grant  are  estimated  at \n$25.64 million equivalent, including civil works cost of contract NP2 (62 km), price adjustments \non  the  existing  ADB-financed  contract  packages  (contracts  B1,  NP1,  and  AR2),  additional \nproject administration costs, and taxes and duties of $1.64 million.

The \nADF  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 years,  with  an  interest \ncharge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% per  annum  thereafter  and  such \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and grant agreement. The ADF grant will \nbe fully utilized before the ADF loan is disbursed (Appendix 4).  \n \n48. \nADB  will  finance  94%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  supplementary  financing,  and  the \ngovernment  will  provide  $1.64  million  equivalent  to  finance  all  local  taxes  and  duties.

The  MCC  grant  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel \ncofinancing basis. The PRC grant of $3.2 million has been fully utilized.  \n\n \n\nF. \n\nChanges in Implementation Arrangements  \n\n51. \nThe Ministry of Road, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development will be the \nexecuting agency for the project. The implementation arrangements on accounting, auditing and \nreporting,  and  project  management  arrangements  for  the  supplementary  financing  remain  the \nsame as those for the main project.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nthe \n\nto  be \n\nfinancing, \n\nfurther  extended \n\nDisbursement  arrangements.  The  supplementary \n\nImplementation  period. As stated in the 2004 RRP (footnote 1), the project was to be \n52. \ncompleted by 31 July 2009, with an ADB loan closing date of 1 January 2010. According to the \nrevised implementation schedule (Appendix 5), packages B1, NP1, and AR2 are expected to be \ncompleted by the end of 2010; and package AR1 will be completed in the third quarter of 2011. \nPackage NP2, which is to be financed by the supplementary loan, is expected to be completed \nby the end of June 2013. To enable the completion of packages B1, NP1, AR1, and AR2 under \nthe original loan on 3 December 2009, ADB approved an extension of the loan closing date by \n2 years  from  1  January  2010  to  31  December  2011.  To  complete  package  NP2  under  the \nto \nloan  closing  date  will  have \nsupplementary \n31 December 2013.  \n \n53. \nProcurement.  Only  one  package  (NP2)  will  be  procured  under  the  supplementary \nfinancing  (Appendix  6).  The  civil  works  for  package  NP2  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  will  follow  the \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) single-stage, two-envelope procedure, as the estimated \ncontract value exceeds $1 million\u2014the ICB threshold for civil works in Mongolia.  \n \n54. \nfinancial  assistance  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). The civil work contracts will be disbursed using ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures. \nThe  original  loan  will  at  all  times  and  in  all  respects  be  held,  used,  committed,  invested,  or \notherwise disposed of entirely before supplementary financing is used. The $16 million grant will \nbe  used,  committed,  invested,  or  otherwise  disposed  of  entirely  before  the  $8  million  loan  is \nused.  The  current  imprest  account  for  the  main  loan,  which  was  originally  used  for \ndisbursements for expenditure of the project implementation unit, will be continued to cover the \ndisbursement of loan funds of the original loan. Two new imprest accounts will be opened under \nthe supplementary financing\u2014one for the loan, and one for the grant. The imprest accounts will \nbe  opened  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the  ceiling  of  each  of  the  imprest \naccounts will be set as either the estimated expenditures to be financed through the respective \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months,  or  $500,000,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB's  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures  may  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenses  and  liquidating \nadvances  from  the  imprest  accounts.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated \nunder the statement of expenditure procedure will not exceed $100,000 equivalent. \n \n55. \nAdvance  action  and  retroactive  financing.  To  speed  up  the  contract  award  for \npackage  NP2,  the  government  has  requested  ADB's  approval  of  advance  action  so  that  ADB \ncan review the procurement process without waiting for approval of the supplementary financing. \nAdvance action covers invitation for bids, bidding, bid evaluation, and limited contract awards. \nThe  government  has  also  requested  approval  of  retroactive  financing  for  the  price  adjustment \nfor  packages  B1,  NP1,  and  AR2  to  enable  the  contractors  to  complete  the  respective  road \nsections.  Advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  and  retroactive  financing  not  exceeding  20%  of  the  total  ADB  supplementary \nfinancing arrangement will be extended. The government  will also be advised that approval of \nthe advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project \nand that the expenditure must have been incurred before loan effectiveness but no earlier than \n12 months before the date of signing of the supplementary financial agreement. It was agreed \nthat ICB procedures will be used for procuring civil works contract packages under retroactive \nfinancing.  \n \n56. \nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the executing agency. Consistent with its \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nproject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nexecuting agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate  to  the  project.  ADB\u2019s  midterm  review  of  the  original  loan  found  no  indication  of  any \npotential fraud or corruption. The government will continue to ensure that the project funds are \nutilized effectively and efficiently to implement the project and to achieve its objectives.  \n \n57. \nProject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  project  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated  against  the  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  with  updated  baseline \nindicators (Appendix 1). \n \nG. \n \n58. \nTo  ensure  the  revised  implementation  schedule  is  adhered  to,  ADB  will  assist  the \ngovernment  to  (i)  finalize  the  bidding  documents  for  package  NP2,  (ii)  undertake  bidding  and \naward the contract for package NP2, (iii) award the contract for package AR1, (iv) increase the \nnumber of project supervision missions from one to two each year, (v) coordinate with the MCC \non the implementation of package A, and (vi) work with the government to complete the other \nproject activities on schedule. \n\nRemedial Steps \n\n \n\nIV. \n\n PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \nDespite  the  cost  increase  and  implementation  delay,  the  project  remains  economically \n59. \nviable.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  recalculated  using \nthe  same  methodology, \nassumptions,  and  baseline  traffic  as  in  the  2004  RRP  (footnote  1),  incorporating  updated \ninformation on project capital cost, traffic growth rate, fuel prices, vehicle operating costs, and \nproject  schedule  reflecting  the  4  year  delay  in  completion.  The  analysis  covers  a  period  of \n20 years from 2006 to 2025.  \n \n60. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  project  comprise  capital  costs\u2014including  labor,  equipment, \nmaterials,  consulting  services,  and  physical  contingency\u2014and  maintenance  costs.  The \nopportunity  cost  of  land  is  assumed  to  be  zero  since  the  land  along  the  alignment  is  of  low \nquality and does not have an alternative productive use.  \n \nThe  economic  benefits  consist  of  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  time  savings  for \n61. \nroad users, and benefits from the generated traffic. Unquantified economic benefits include the \ncontribution  of  improved  transport  to  economic  diversification  and  trade  development,  and \nimproved access to economic opportunities and social services.  \n \n62. \nUsing  a  12%  discount  rate,  the  net  present  value  of  the  project  is  $21.3  million.  The \nestimated  EIRR  is  16.2%.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  remains  economically \nviable if costs rise by 15% or benefits are reduced by 15%. If these changes are combined, the \nEIRR would be reduced to 11.5%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nSocial Impact  \n\n \n\n15\n\n63. \nSupplementary financing will bring benefits to about 10,500 people along the 62 km road \nsection, roughly 21.6% of whom are poor. The project will benefit poor people by enabling the \ndevelopment of the local livestock industry through improved access to domestic and regional \nmarkets.  It  will  also  improve  connectivity  between  local  towns  and  aimags  (provinces),  and \nimprove  access  to  higher-quality  social  services  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  project  will  directly  and \nindirectly generate local economic benefits during construction and operation.  \n\nThe  main  social  risks  concern  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  These  have  been \n64. \naddressed  through  prevention  and  awareness  measures  for  contractors,  laborers,  and  local \ncommunities,  which  were  financed  by  an  associated  TA  (footnote  1).  Establishment  of  a \nvoluntary  counseling  and  testing  center,  together  with  provision  of  (i)  required  equipment, \n(ii) drugs  and  tests  for  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  infections,  (iii)  information, \neducation,  and  communication  materials,  and  (iv)  training,  contributed  to  the  improvements  in \nquality and access to services for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Training \nand  awareness  materials  produced  under  the  TA  will  continue  to  be  used  under  the \nsupplementary financing.  \n \nC. \n\nResettlement and Indigenous Peoples Safeguards \n\nSocial aspects remain unchanged from the original loan. The land to be acquired for the \n65. \nproject and temporary use of land for construction will not involve any removal of structures or \naffect private landowners. The land is state owned, and is waste land. The project will not affect \nany ethnic minority groups. The project remains category C for involuntary resettlement and for \nindigenous peoples safeguard aspects. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n66. \nThe  original  loan  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) was undertaken through broad-based public consultations, and the summary \nEIA  was  circulated  to  the  Board  and  made  public  on  the  ADB  website  on  5 March 2004.  The \nEIA was approved by the Ministry of Nature and Environment on 12 May 2004 and concluded \nthat the project will have no major adverse impacts on the environment. As there has been no \nchange  in  scope  or  design,  the  approved  EIA  is  still  applicable.  There  will  be  no  additional \nenvironmental  impacts  apart  from  those  identified  in  the  approved  EIA.  During  project \nimplementation, the government will continue to implement the mitigating measures stipulated in \nthe EIA.  \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n67. \nThe following risks have been considered in formulating the supplementary assistance: \ncost overrun, implementation delay, and noncompletion of the 176 km road section which will be \nfinanced by the MCC. \n\n68. \nTo mitigate the risk of cost overrun, the revised project cost is based on the work items \nand  quantities  included  in  the  detailed  engineering  design,  the  cost  estimates  have  been \nupdated  to  2009  price  levels,  and  relatively  high-cost  escalation  factors  have  been  used  in \nestimating  price  contingencies  as  published  by  ADB  for  2009\u20132013  (9.5%  for  local  currency \ncosts  and  1.9%  for  foreign  currency  costs).  To  mitigate  risks  of  procurement-related  delays, \nprocurement of package NP2 using ICB will follow the single-stage two-envelope procurement \nprocedure, with advance procurement action and retroactive financing to expedite early contract \naward and commencement. To mitigate the risk of delays in issuing work permits and customs \nclearance of construction equipment, the government has given an assurance that it will ensure \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\ntimely issuance of these permits and prompt clearance of the necessary equipment. To mitigate \nthe risk of noncompletion of the 176 km road section, ADB will coordinate closely with the MCC \nto monitor timely implementation.  \n\n69. \nThe design and monitoring framework has been revised with assumptions that political \nstability and economic growth are maintained in the region, and that a transit traffic framework \nagreement among the PRC, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation is in place by 2012. It was \nalso  assumed  that  the  MCC  will  secure  a  qualified  contractor  to  complete  the  176  km  road \nsection by 2012. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n70. \nIn  addition  to  the  assurances  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  dated  1  May  2004,  with \nwhich it will continue to comply, the Government of Mongolia has given the following additional \nassurances, which were incorporated in the legal document:  \n\nThe  government  will  ensure  that  the  one  hundred  seventy  six  (176)  km  road \nsection from Choyr to 35th railway crossing will be completed by 30 June 2013. \nThe  government  will  further  ensure  that  the  technical  standards  of  the  railway \ncrossing  in  terms  of  width,  pavement  structure,  safety  and  environment \nmeasures will be in accordance to (a) the measures set out in the feasibility study \nand  road  safety  audit;  and  (b)  international  practices,  including  those  of  the \nFederation  Internationale  des  Ingenieurs-Conseils  (FIDIC),  notably  with  respect \nto the use of an external supervision consultant.  \n\nThe  government  will  deploy  its  best  efforts  during  contract  bidding  and \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  the  project  can  be  completed  by  30  June  2013, \nincluding  undertaking  timely  bid  evaluation,  prompt  signing  of  contracts  and \nissuance of the notice to proceed, and timely settlement of contractors' claims. \n\nThe government will further ensure that (a) the contractors will receive their work \npermits within twenty (20) working days from the date of application, and (b) the \nconstruction  equipment  will  be  cleared  from  customs  within  twenty  (20) working \ndays from the date of application. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n71. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve  \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR5,199,000  to  Mongolia  for  the \nRegional  Road  Development  Project  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  with \nan  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $16,000,000  to  Mongolia,  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources, for the Regional Road Development Project, on terms and conditions \nthat  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement presented to the Board.      \n\nC.

The  estimated  civil  works  cost  has  risen  from  $132,757  per  kilometer  in \n2004  to  $285,140  per  kilometer  in  2009,  an  increase  of  115%.  The  cost  increase  is  mainly \nattributable  to  a  combination  of  two  factors:  cost  underestimation  in  the  2004  report  and \nrecommendation of the President1 (RRP), and implementation delay combined with inflation.   \n \n2. \nCost  underestimation.  The  2004  RRP  indicated  that,  based  on  the  findings  of  the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA),  the  civil  works  base  cost  for  the  project  road \nincluding taxes  was  $56.82  million.  The  TA  final  report  dated  10  January  2004  provided  three \nsets  of  cost  estimates  for  the  424.4 km  road  from  Choyr  to  Zamyn-Uud 2 for  three  different \nsurfacing  options:  asphalt  concrete,  double  bituminous  surface  treatment,  and  gravel. 3 The \ndesign  parameters  and  cost  estimates  for  each  pavement  design  option  as  stated  in  the  final \nreport are summarized in Table A2.1. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Cost Estimates for Three Pavement Design Options \n\nItem \n1.

However,  the  cost  of  construction  facilities  and  vehicles  should  also  be \nincluded  as  part  of  the  civil  works  cost  because  these  are  normally  provided  through \ncontractors.

The  cost \nestimate of $1.49 million was provided in the RRP.  \n \n4. \nThe  final  report  stated  that  the  project  road  was  entirely  a  new  one  and  that  detailed \nengineering  should  be  carried  out  before  embarking  on  implementation.  The  cost  estimates \nprovided  in  the  TA  final  report  were  based  on work  item  identification and  quantification  using \nfield observation data supplemented by detailed surveys and investigations on a sample basis, \npreliminary designs, and experience-based data for similar projects. The unit costs for the work \nitems  were  based  on  the  cost  data  available  from  two  internationally  financed  road  projects \ncombined with the project-related information and judgment.  \n \n5. \nThe  RRP  provided  for  detailed  design  to  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project \nimplementation and was to be financed by the  government. This was completed in July 2005. \nThe  revised  cost  estimates  were  significantly  higher  than  those  in  the  RRP  ($27.14 million). \nComparisons  of  the  cost  estimates  in  the  final  report  and  detailed  design,  unit  costs,  and \nquantities for the Choyr to Zamyn-Uud road are in Tables A2.2, A2.3, and A2.4.

The main problem, however, was the underestimation of work items and quantities. The \nbill  of  quantities  in  the  detailed  design  completed  by  the  government  in  July  2005  provided \nsignificantly  more  work  items  and  quantities  than  the  final  report,  particularly  with  respect  to \nearthworks,  subbase  and  base,  and  drainage  and  bridge  protection.  The  government  has \nconfirmed that there was no change in the design parameters between project preparatory TA \nand the detailed design stages, so the underestimation of work items and quantities was due to \nthe absence of detailed engineering information at the project preparatory TA stage.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n22 \n \n\nTable A2.3: Unit Cost Comparison \n\n \nUnit \n\nTA Final \nReport \n($) \n\nDetailed \nDesign \n($) \n\n Actual Contracts  \n\nB1 \n($) \n\nNP1 \n($) \n\n800.00 \n\n1,540.00  \n\n863.00 \n\n950.00 \n\nItem \n\n1.

This  was  confirmed  by  the  contract  price  of  package  A  and  the  lowest \nevaluated responsive bid prices for packages B1 and B2 in October 2006: \n \n\nPackage  A.  The  $31  million  contract  exceeded  financing  by  the  Economic \nDevelopment Cooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea of $23.9 million based \non  the  RRP  estimate.  This  required  the  government  to  provide  additional \nfinancing of $7.1 million. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\n(ii) \n\nPackages  B1  and  B2. The combined lowest evaluated responsive bid prices of \nthe two packages of $57.41 million exceeded the RRP estimate of $26.82 million, \nand would require additional funding.  \n\n \nInflation and implementation delay. The second cause of cost increases was the high \n8. \ninflation experienced during project implementation. This led to dramatic increases in the cost of \nroad  construction  and  was  reflected  in  higher  contract  prices  and  claims  for  price  adjustment. \nThis  was  exacerbated  by  implementation  delays,  which  led  to  bidding  and  award  of  contract \nbeing  significantly  later  than  the  original  project  schedule  and  the  contract  implementation \nperiod being exceeded.  \n \n \n9. \nInflation  based  on  Mongolia's  consumer  price  index  was  9.6%  in  2005,  5.9%  in  2006, \n14.1% in 2007, and 23.2% in 2008.4 As a result, the prices of road construction materials soared. \nTable A2.5 shows the price comparison between 2006 and 2008 made by the government using \nthe  bid  prices  in  2006  and  actual  purchase  prices  for  package  B1.  The  prices  of  many  key \nmaterials rose by a factor of 2\u20133.  \n \n\nTable A2.5: Unit Price Increase for Major Road Construction Materials \n\nUnit Rate in \n2006 ($) \n30.00 \n30.00 \n300.00 \n0.54 \n0.42 \n\nUnit Rate in \n2008 ($) \n60.00 \n100.00 \n650.00 \n1.37 \n1.23 \n\nPrice Increase \n(%) \n100 \n233 \n117 \n154 \n193 \n\nUnit \nton \nton \nton \nliter \nliter \n\nMaterials \nCement M425 \nCement 525 \nBitumen \nDiesel \nPetrol \nSource: Government of Mongolia. \n \n10. \nFor  most  of  the  contract  packages,  the  government  required  longer  than  originally \nscheduled  to  complete  the  bidding  process  and  award  contracts.  Of  the  contract  packages \nunder  ADB,  three  packages  (B1,  NP1,  and  AR2)  were  awarded  on  an  average  of  22  months \nlater  than  expected  in  the  RRP,  two  contracts  (NP2,  AR1)  remain  to  be  awarded  (about \n60 months  behind  schedule),  and  one  contract  (A)  is  likely  to  be  terminated  followed  by  new \nbidding and contract award. Details of delays in contract awards are provided in Table A2.6. \n \n11. \nAfter  contracts  were  awarded,  most  of  the  contractors  faced  obstacles  that  delayed \ncontract implementation. Among these were delays in issuing work permits, delays in customs \nclearance of construction equipment, late  payment, and delays due to changes in engineering \ndesign. Since the construction season in Mongolia is short due to the  long and severe winter, \nsuch delays had a particularly adverse effect on implementation progress.  \n \n12. \nThe combined effect of these delays is that the projected completion date of the project \nroad  is  3.5  years  later  than  originally  scheduled.  Most  of  the  contract  awards  were  therefore \nsubjected  to  the  effects  of  the  recent  very  high  inflation.  Due  to  delays  in  contract \nimplementation outside of the control of the contractors, three of the contractors (for packages \nB1,  NP1,  and  AR2)  submitted  claims  for  price  escalation.  Following  review  by  the  supervision \nconsultant, the government has accepted that price escalation should be paid in cases where it \nwas  not  possible  for  the  contractor  to  complete  the  work  within  the  contract  period  and  in \nrespect  of  construction  materials  purchased  after  the  original  contract  period.  The  estimated \ncost of contract variations for such price escalation is $3.95 million.  \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2009.

Taken together, the cost underestimation in the RRP and the combination \n13. \nof  implementation  delays  and  inflation  have  raised  the  estimated  cost  of  the  civil  works  to \n$115.46 million in 2009 prices.

All benefits and \ncosts are in US dollars and in constant 2003 prices.  \n \nB. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nThe original traffic forecast prepared in 2003 for the 2006\u20132025 period followed a three-\n\nInitial  traffic  forecasts  were  based  on  an  analysis  of  macro-level  demographic \ntrends for Mongolia, as well as for the corridor between Choyr and the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) border in Zamyn-Uud. \n\nMacro-level  forecasts  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic  between  Choyr  and \nZamyn-Uud  were  disaggregated  into  road  and  rail  transport,  based  on  data \ngathered from interviews, traffic surveys,2 and published reports and statistics on \nrecent and anticipated modal shares. \n\nBased  on  survey  data  and  actual  traffic  patterns  along  the  project  road,  road \ntraffic projections were further disaggregated into three types of traffic: (a) normal \ntraffic, (b) generated traffic (traffic that develops due to reduced transport costs or \nincreased business activities in the project area), and (c) diverted traffic (diverted \nfrom the existing railway to the project road). \n\n \n3. \nThe  original  forecast  projected  Mongolia's  annual  gross  domestic  product  at  4.5%  and \npopulation  growth  at  0.95%  over  the  life  of  the  project.  Traffic  on  the  corridor  between  Choyr \nand Zamyn-Uud was forecast to grow by 6.3% per annum for freight and 5.1% per annum for \npassengers.  Traffic  on  this  corridor  has  the  options  of  road  and  rail.  Based  on  existing  modal \nshares and an analysis of traffic patterns derived from surveys, and taking into account factors \nsuch  as  commodity  type,  distance,  and  transport  cost,  traffic  on  the  corridor  was  assigned \nbetween road and rail modes. The railway was expected to remain dominant, but the share of \nroads  was  projected  to  increase  from  3.7%  to  23.8%  for  freight,  and  from  0.4%  to  5.8%  for \npassengers. Without the project, road traffic would continue to move along existing unimproved \nearth  tracks,  and  would  remain  low.  With  the  project,  traffic  was  projected  to  grow  quickly,  as \nthe road would capture most internal passenger traffic along the corridor and a growing share of \ntime-sensitive, high-value commodities (such as palletized freight). This would free capacity on \nthe  congested  rail  line.  Regional  traffic  (transit  traffic  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian \nFederation,  and  export  and  import  traffic  between  Mongolia  and  the  PRC)  was  projected  to \nconstitute a large and growing share of the traffic, rising from 30% in 2006 to 75% in 2025. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project. Manila (Loan 2087-MON, approved on \n22 July). \n\n2  The surveys included (i) traffic counts and origin\u2013destination surveys conducted in August 2003 along the project \nroad alignment, (ii) vehicle axle load survey conducted in September 2003, (iii) border survey conducted in August \n2003 in Zamyn-Uud, and (iv) survey of road-based business establishments conducted in September 2003 along \nthe Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darhan road. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nThe  original  traffic  forecast  as  stated  has  been  updated  on  the  basis  of  current \n4. \nmacroeconomic  data  including  changes  in  fuel  prices  and  updated  information  on  actual  and \nforecast  economic  growth  using  the  latest  annual  traffic  counts  for  the  corridor  (2006).3 The \ntraffic elasticity to economic growth was left unchanged at 1.2 for passenger traffic and 1.4 for \nfreight traffic. Delayed road opening will defer the commencement of traffic benefit by 4 years, \nfrom 2009 to 2013.

The  financial  capital  costs  were  converted  into  economic  costs  using  a \ncomposite  conversion  factor  of  1.01  (Table  A7.2). 4  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and \nnontradable components. A shadow wage factor of 0.7 was used to estimate the economic price \nof  unskilled  workers,  considering  that,  if  unemployed  people  are  hired  under  the  project,  their \neconomic  opportunity  cost  would  be  low.  The  analysis  is  based  on  a  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor  of  1.019  (Table  A7.3).

All  costs  were \nconverted  to  a  constant  2003  price  base  for  the  purpose  of  the  economic  analysis,  to  ensure \ncomparability  with  former  evaluations  of  project  costs  and  benefits.  This  was  done  using \ncombinations  of  consumer  price  index  deflators  for  local  and  foreign  costs.  The  updated \neconomic capital costs5 of the project were estimated at $95.75 million in constant 2003 prices, \n47% above the initial economic cost estimates (Table A7.4). The real cost increase is below the \nnominal project cost increase, as a significant part of the cost overrun is due to inflation. \n  \n\nTable A7.4: Revised Economic Capital Costs \n($ million) \n\nItem \nFinancial Cost \nInterests during construction \nPrice contingencies \nTaxes and duties \nComposite conversion factor \nConversion to 2003 prices \nEconomic Cost \n\nRRP Estimates \n78.14 \n(1.80) \n(4.90) \n(6.76) \n0.50 \n \n65.18 \n\nRevised Estimates \n141.90 \n(2.19) \n(1.93) \n(11.51) \n0.98 \n(31.50) \n95.75 \n\n \n \n\n( ) = negative, RRP = report and recommendation of the President. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n5  Economic costs do not include taxes and price contingencies but reflect the real increase in input prices.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nEconomic  benefits. Economic benefits consist of savings in transport costs and travel \n7. \ntime  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic,  which  are  valued  in  terms  of  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings  for  normal  traffic,  (ii)  difference  in  cost  and  travel  time  of  using  the  railway  and  the \nproject road for diverted traffic, and (iii) 50% of vehicle operating cost savings from normal traffic \nas proxy for the willingness to pay for generated traffic. Traffic safety benefits were incorporated \nin  the  economic  analysis  update  but  amount  to  only  0.08%  of  benefits.  The  time  savings \nanalysis  was  based  on  a  value  of  time  savings  equivalent  to  the  average  Mongolian  hourly \nsalary  (about  $1 per  hour)  for  car  passengers,  and  half  that  ($0.50  per  hour)  for  bus \npassengers. Only time savings for drivers and crew were considered for freight traffic.

Using a 12% discount rate, the economic benefits of the project \nremain  substantial.  The  reevaluated  net  present  value  of  the  project  is  $21.3  million,  and  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.2% (Table A7.6). The revised EIRR of the project \nis  below  the  former  estimates  due  to  the  combined  effects  of  the  higher  capital  costs,  lower \ntraffic forecasts, and road opening delays.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n33 \n\n \n\nTable A7.6: Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis  \n($ million) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTransport \nCost \nSavings \n\nTime and \nSafety \nSavings \n\nCapital Cost \n0.61 \n8.85 \n12.01 \n12.11 \n11.31 \n27.18 \n21.65 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMaintenance \nCost \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.57 \n0.57 \n0.61 \n7.15 \n0.74 \n0.65 \n0.68 \n0.68 \n21.57 \n1.10 \n0.76 \n0.76 \n0.79 \n\nYear \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n  \n  \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2.52 \n2.73 \n2.88 \n3.03 \n3.21 \n3.38 \n3.56 \n3.75 \n3.93 \n4.13 \n4.33 \n4.54 \n4.77 \nNet present value at 12% discount rate \nEIRR \n\n17.89 \n19.81 \n20.94 \n22.12 \n23.60 \n24.91 \n26.28 \n27.73 \n29.03 \n30.34 \n31.76 \n33.25 \n34.83 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nNet Benefit \n      (0.61) \n      (8.85) \n     (12.01) \n     (12.12) \n     (11.32) \n     (27.18) \n     (21.65) \n      19.85  \n      21.97  \n      23.21  \n      18.00  \n      26.08  \n      27.64  \n      29.16  \n      30.80  \n      11.39  \n      33.37  \n      35.33  \n      37.03  \n      38.81  \n21.28 \n16.21% \n\n \n9. \nSensitivity  analysis. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to test the effects of negative \nchanges  on  key  parameters  that  determine  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  project  on  economic \nviability. The result (Table A7.7) indicates that the EIRR of the project exceeds or is close to the \ncutoff level of 12%, even if these are under significant increases in costs or reductions in user \nbenefits. The EIRR may fall just below 12% in the case of a 15% increase in total project cost \ncombined  with  a  15%  decrease  in  benefits.  An  additional  cost  overrun  of  35%  of  total  project \ncost could compromise project viability. To reach this threshold, the cost of the works that have \nnot yet been completed would have to rise 54% above the 2009 estimates. \n \n\nTable A7.7: Sensitivity Analysis  \n\nItem \nBase case \nCapital cost increase by 15% \nMaintenance cost increase by 15% \nOverall cost increase by 15% (A) \nUser benefits decrease by 15% (B) \nCombined (A) and (B) \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \na  Factors applied to the best estimate for each cost or benefit item to reduce EIRR to a 12% threshold. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n16.21 \n14.20 \n16.00 \n14.00 \n14.00 \n11.50 \n\nNet Present \nValue \n($ million) \n21.28 \n12.20 \n20.10 \n11.00 \n11.00 \n(2.40) \n\nSwitching \nValue (%)a \n \n35 \n264 \n \n(23) \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 March 2010) \n \ntogrog (MNT) \n$0.0006900 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n=  MNT1,449.25 \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Currency Unit \nMNT1.00 \n$1.00 \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "ADB \nADF \nEDCF Korea \nEIA \nEIRR \nGDP \nICB \nIMF \nkm \nkm2 \nm \nMCC \nPRC \nRRP \nSDR \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nEconomic Development Cooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \ninternational competitive bidding  \nInternational Monetary Fund \nkilometer \nsquare kilometer \nmeter \nMillennium Challenge Corporation \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nreport and recommendation of the President \nspecial drawing rights \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n", "C.
