Despite  constraints  such  as  its  hilly  terrain,  poor  connectivity,  and  predominantly  rural \npopulation (90%), the state\u2019s economic, poverty, education, and health indicators have improved \nsignificantly since 2000. GOHP has successfully increased school and college enrollments over \nthe past decade. This project will support it in addressing the \u201csecond-generation\u201d challenge of \nproviding  relevant  and  good  quality  TVET  opportunities  to  its  youth  to  prepare  them  for  the \nchanging labor market.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nBetween FY2005 and FY2014, Himachal Pradesh grew at an average annual rate of 7.8% \n3. \ncompared  with  7.6%  for  the  Indian  economy.  Overall  poverty  declined  from  22.9%  to  8.1% \nbetween FY2005 and FY2012.2 Rural poverty also declined sharply from 25.6% to 8.5% over this \nperiod. Nearly all villages of Himachal Pradesh have access to electricity. Two-thirds of the rural \nhouseholds have  access  to sanitation facilities, compared  with  the  all-India average of  30.7%. \nLife expectancy at 70 years is higher than the national average of 66.1 years. Between 1991 and \n2011, Himachal Pradesh\u2019s literacy rate increased from 63.7% to 82.8%. Male literacy rose from \n75.3% to 89.5%, and female literacy from 52.1% to 75.9%. In FY2016, the net enrollment ratio in \nHimachal Pradesh was 67% at the secondary and 54% at the higher secondary level, compared \nwith 51% and 33% for India.3 The gross enrollment ratio in higher education for youth aged 18\u2013\n23 years in 2014\u20132015 was 28.4% for men and 32.5% for women.4  \n \nDespite the increase in secondary school and college enrollment,  Himachal Pradesh is \n4. \nconstrained by the low employability of its school and college graduates. Like in other states of \nIndia, general education at the secondary and college levels in Himachal Pradesh is weak and \nnot adequately aligned to the needs of the market. The challenge of \u201ceducated unemployment\u201d is \ngrowing.5 The state\u2019s TVET programs  are constrained owing to outdated curricula and training \nequipment, limited reach of training facilities, and weak industry links. The TVET programs are \nfragmented across 12 state government departments. Consequently, there are no uniform norms \n\n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided $725,000 in project preparatory technical assistance.

New Delhi.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nfor training quality, certification, or placement outcomes. More than 90% of Himachal Pradesh\u2019s \nworkforce has not received any formal skills training. Consequently, dependence on government \njobs remains high. In 2014, 65% of organized sector employment in Himachal Pradesh was in the \npublic sector.6 This is fiscally unsustainable and economically unproductive.7 \n \n5. \nThere is a significant mismatch between Himachal Pradesh\u2019s economic and employment \nprofiles  which  should  be  addressed  urgently  to  tap  the  state\u2019s  human  resource  base  more \neffectively.  In  FY2014,  the  primary  sector  in Himachal  Pradesh accounted for  only  19%  of the \nstate\u2019s gross domestic product but 58.5% of the workforce reflecting its very low labor productivity. \nThe tertiary sector and the secondary sector accounted for 43.0% and 38.0% of the state\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product  but  only  19.0%  and  22.5%  of  the  workforce  respectively.8 Further,  while  the \nstate has broad gender parity in school and college enrollment rates, there is sharp disparity in \nthe workforce participation rates. In 2012, the average workforce participation rate was 87% for \nrural men and 73% for urban men, but 63% for rural women and only 28% for urban women.9 As \nHimachal  Pradesh  continues  to  urbanize  and  the  share  of  the  services  sector  grows,  it  is \nnecessary to expand market-linked TVET opportunities for women. \n \n6. \nIt  is  estimated that  net  demand for  skilled  workers  in Himachal  Pradesh will  amount  to \n515,557 between 2017 and 2022 across various trades such as retail, health care, tourism and \nhospitality, and information technology.10 The state has a narrow demographic window until 2022, \nafter which the share of the working-age population (15\u221259 years) will begin to decline.11 GOHP \nis  keen  to  take  advantage  of  this  demographic  window  by  providing  market-linked  skilling \nopportunities  to  those  aged  15\u201335  years.  The  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  of  Himachal  Pradesh, \n2012\u22122017 emphasizes the need for \u201cfaster, inclusive, and sustainable development\u201d.12 As part \nof this goal, GOHP aims to enhance livelihood and employment opportunities for the state\u2019s youth. \nIt  established  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Kaushal  Vikas  Nigam  (HPKVN)  as  a  specialized  skills \ndevelopment  company  under  the  Department  of  Planning  (DOP)  in  September  2015,  to \nconsolidate the state\u2019s fragmented TVET programs, align all TVET programs with India\u2019s National \nSkills  Qualification  Framework  (NSQF),  and  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  design and \ndelivery  of  TVET.13 This  approach  is  aligned  with  India\u2019s  National  Policy  on  Skill  Development \nand Entrepreneurship (2015), which encourages states to develop umbrella skills development \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  Directorate  of  Employment.  2015.

These levels, graded from 1 to 10, \nare defined in terms of learning outcomes which the learner must possess regardless of whether they are obtained \nthrough formal, nonformal, or informal learning. NSQF is an integrated education and competency-based framework \nproviding for multiple pathways, horizontal as well as vertical, within and across TVET and general education. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nmissions with \u201cthe overarching power to pool resources for harmonizing the skilling efforts across \nline departments, private agencies, and voluntary organizations, and reducing duplication\u201d.14  \n \n7. \nValue added by ADB assistance. In June 2016, GOHP approved the Himachal Pradesh \nSkills  Development  Policy  (Him  Kaushal),  2016  to  guide  the  reform  and  scaling-up  of  skills \ndevelopment  efforts  in  the  state. 15  The  project  will  build  HPKVN\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to \noperationalize this policy and deliver the challenging mandate of the state\u2019s skills development \nmission effectively. The project will add value by supporting GOHP in providing NSQF-aligned \nvocational training and livelihood development opportunities to around 65,000 needy youth over \n2017\u22122022,  introducing  3-year  bachelor  of  vocational  education  courses  and  employability \nenhancing  skills  courses  in  selected  colleges,  expanding  Himachal  Pradesh\u2019s  annual  TVET \ntraining capacity by 13,000, and extending the reach of quality training facilities and counseling \nservices to underserved parts of the state. The project will fund a menu of short-term and long-\nterm  training  programs  in  growth  areas  including  automobiles,  electronics,  pharmaceuticals, \nretail, tourism and hospitality, banking and financial  services, health care, apparel, beauty and \nwellness, construction, and food processing to help the youth of Himachal Pradesh in making the \ntransition from the primary sector to the secondary and tertiary sectors, where job prospects are \nbetter  and  remuneration  levels  are  higher.  These  training  programs  will  also  expand  career \nchoices  for  women  and  raise  their  workforce  participation  rates.  Engagement  with  industry \nassociations,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  training  programs  will  be  strengthened  to \nensure the long-term relevance and sustainability of the reforms being supported by this project. \n \n8. \nThe  project  reflects  the  priorities  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,  which  aims  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  in  facilitating \ninclusive  growth.  Skills  development  is  a  major  priority  of  the  Government  of  India,  and  a  key \ninstrument for empowering people.16 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, \nwhich  emphasizes  the  need  for  ADB  to  focus  on  post-basic  education  and  TVET  to  promote \nhuman  capital  development. 17 The  experience  gained  from  ADB\u2019s  two  ongoing  loans  in  the \neducation  sector  in  India  reiterates  the  importance  of  good  quality  counseling  and  placement \nservices for matching trainees to the right types of training programs and job openings, ongoing \ncoordination with industry associations and sector skills councils to ensure market-relevance, and \nclose monitoring and tracking of training programs.18  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: a more productive workforce created in \nHimachal  Pradesh  equipped  with  market-relevant  technical  and  vocational  skills  (footnote  15). \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n14   Government  of  India.  2015.

Depending on the background and \naspirations  of  the  trainees  and  market  demand,  HPKVN  will  provide  training  opportunities  for \nformal  wage  employment  or  for  livelihood  and  small  business  development.  The  latter  type  of \nsupport will be provided at the city livelihood centers (CLCs) and rural livelihood centers (RLCs) \nto be established under the project. Introduction of bachelor of vocational education (NSQF level \n7)  courses  in  colleges  will  help  to  integrate  vocational  education  with  higher  education  and \nestablish a career path. Vocational training will also be provided to third-year college students in \ntrades such as banking, electronics, and retail to make them more employable after graduation. \nOverall,  improved TVET opportunities  will  be  provided  to  around  65,000  needy  youth over  the \nperiod 2017\u20132022. \n\n \n\n12. \nOutput  2:  Market-aligned  skills  ecosystem  created.  The  project  will  (i)  upgrade  11 \nemployment exchanges into model career centers (MCCs) to build awareness among youth about \nTVET opportunities; (ii) design and operationalize a management information system (MIS) to link \nHPKVN,  the  Department  of  Technical  Education,  Vocational  and  Industrial  Training  (DOTE), \nDOHE,  and  the  MCCs  to  India\u2019s  National  Career  Services  portal;  and  (iii)  support  HPKVN  in \nforging  partnerships  with  industry  associations  and  sector  skills  councils  to  get  demand \ninformation,  and  identify  internship  and  placement  opportunities.  The  MCCs  will  have  career \ncounselors  for  guiding  the  youth  in  selecting  relevant  TVET  programs,  aligned  with  their \naspirations and market demand. By linking the MCCs to the National Career Services portal, the \nMIS will enable the trained and certified youth of Himachal Pradesh to access job opportunities \nacross India.  \n \n13. \nOutput 3: Access to quality training institutes improved. The project will (i) establish \nsix CLCs and seven RLCs to provide vocational training and business development support to \nurban and rural poor to improve their livelihood; (ii) assist DOTE in establishing a new polytechnic \nfor  women  in  Rehan,  Kangra,  as  well  as  a  center  of  excellence  for  industry-led  skilling;  and \n(iii) assist  DOTE  in  upgrading  the  training  equipment  for  22  trades  in  50  industrial  training \ninstitutes (ITIs) in line with the 2014 guidelines of the National Council for Vocational Training. \nThe CLCs and RLCs will provide gender-separated hostels to enable trainees from small towns \nand remote villages to access the livelihood and small business development opportunities. The \nwomen\u2019s polytechnic in Rehan will offer diplomas in civil engineering, architectural assistantship, \nelectrical  engineering,  and  computer  engineering.  It  will  have  an  annual  training  capacity  of \naround 720 and hostel facilities for 120 women. By providing new training equipment to 50 ITIs \n\n                                                \n19  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n20   From 27 December 2016, no central government funding will be provided for TVET programs that are not aligned \nto the NSQF. All announcements for jobs in the central government, state governments, and public enterprises must \ndefine  eligibility  criteria  in  NSQF  terms.  Hence,  this  project  will  support  the  government  in  aligning  all  TVET \nprograms to the NSQF so that Himachal Pradesh\u2019s youth receive nationally recognized certificates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nacross 22 trades aligned with the latest guidelines of the National Council for Vocational Training, \nthe project will ensure that around 19,000 students will obtain nationally recognized certificates \nfrom the council. This will make them eligible for jobs in public enterprises and private companies \nwithin  and  outside  Himachal  Pradesh.  Results-oriented  institutional  development  plans  will  be \nprepared for these ITIs to ensure that their performance  on key indicators such as placement, \nenrollment of women, and industry engagement improves. \n\n \n\n14. \nOutput 4: TVET institutional structure improved. The project will (i) build the project \nmanagement,  fiduciary,  safeguard,  and  training  capacity  of  HPKVN  and  other  implementing \nagencies;  (ii)  prepare  business  processes  and  standard  operating  protocols  for  HPKVN  staff \ncovering different facets of skilling, including mobilization, counseling, training, assessment and \ncertification, skills-gap analysis, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (iii) operationalize an MIS \nthat will draw information from all the implementing agencies to monitor progress with respect to \nkey results indicators in the design and monitoring framework; (iv) provide consulting inputs for \nproject management, quality monitoring of civil  works, and M&E of all training; and (v) support \ntraining  of  50  master  trainers  in  key  trades.  This  support  will  gradually  break  silos  across \nimplementing agencies, and establish the foundation for a unified skills development mission in \nHimachal Pradesh. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $100  million  (Table  1).

HPKVN, DOHE, DOTE, and \nthe Public Works Department (PWD) will be the four implementing agencies. HPKVN will act as \nthe  project  management  unit.  DOHE,  DOTE,  and  PWD  have  already  established  project \nimplementation units. The funds will be routed by the executing agency through HPKVN to DOHE, \nDOTE, and PWD for all activities. HPKVN will procure all services of training service providers for \nvocational  training,  PWD  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  of  civil  works  and  furniture,  and \nDOTE  will  procure  the  upgraded  training  equipment  for  the  selected  ITIs.  To  facilitate \ncoordination,  all  the  consulting  firms  will  report  to  HPKVN.  As  support  departments,  the \nDepartment  of  Rural  Development  and  Department  of  Urban  Development  will  oversee  the \nlivelihood  development  programs  for  rural  and  urban  youth  in  the  RLCs  and  CLCs,  the \nDepartment of Labour and Employment will support counseling and vocational guidance in the \nupgraded MCCs, the Department of Economics and Statistics will coordinate with the M&E firm \nfor the tracer studies and surveys, and the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment will \nassist in undertaking training for people with disabilities. The support departments will coordinate \nclosely with HPKVN and other implementing agencies as required.  \n \n19. \nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  civil  works,  goods  and \nequipment  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time). The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n22  This is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s choice of repayment options and dates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nDecember 2017\u2013December 2022 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2022 \nEstimated loan closing \ndate \nManagement \n\n30 June 2023 \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv) Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nNonconsulting services  \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nProject steering committee chaired by the chief secretary of the \nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh, and comprising the ACS of the \nDepartment of Planning and Finance; the ACS, principal secretaries, and \nsecretaries of DOHE, DOLE, DOTE, DOUD, DORD, and PWD; advisor, \nDOP; engineer-in-chief, PWD; and managing director of HPKVN \nDOP \nDOHE, DOTE, HPKVN, PWD \n\nHPKVN, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh staff (30 staff)  \nNational competitive \nbidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \n(80:20) \nFixed budget selection  17 packages; training service \n\n9 contract packages (works);  \n15 contract packages (goods)  \n800 person-months; 3 \ncontracts \n\n$24.13 million \n$11.74 million \n$6.58 million \n\n$25.94 million \n\nproviders  \n\nADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow upon request \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing of civil works, equipment \nand materials, and consulting services.

HPKVN already has 27 full-time staff who have been coordinating well \nwith the other implementing agencies. Around 49% of the project\u2019s civil works and goods, 100% \nof  the  consulting  packages,  and  28%  of  the  packages  for  training  service  providers  will  be \ntendered out by mid-October 2017 as part of advance contracting. Further, since November 2016, \nHPKVN has been piloting an NSQF-aligned training program for 1,000 trainees with the help of \nADB consultants. The experience gained through this pilot program and the advance contracting \nactions will help expedite project implementation. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic viability. The economic viability of the project was assessed on the basis of \nthe  benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  investment  project.23 Quantified  economic  benefits \ninclude direct benefits for trainees due to increased employability and higher wages. The major \nstreams of economic costs are direct project costs associated with the four outputs, the private \ncosts of trainees for nominal fees where relevant, and the indirect opportunity cost of their forgone \nearnings during training. The project is estimated to yield a net present value of $47.82 million \nunder the base-case scenario, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) at 17.37%. The \nEIRR was tested for sensitivity to various adverse scenarios: (i) capital cost overrun by 20% (EIRR \n13.67%),  (ii)  recurrent  cost  overrun  by  20%  (EIRR  15.09%),  (iii)  starting  wages  lower  by  20% \n(EIRR  13.15%),  and  (iv)  capital  cost  overrun  by  20%  and  post-training  wages  lower  by  20% \n(10.11%). In all cases, the EIRR exceeds the required rate of 9%, suggesting that the investment \nprogram is economically robust. \n \n23. \nSustainability of reforms. TVET will continue to be of high priority for GOHP. The outlay \nfor the project represents around 47% of the state\u2019s TVET spending and only 0.3% of total GOHP \nexpenditure  over the  project  period. The  GOHP\u2019s  counterpart  commitment for  the  project  as  a \nshare of the total education budget (or TVET budget) is projected to increase slightly from 0.32% \n(6%) in FY2018 to 0.46% (9%) by FY2022, which is reasonable. Himachal Pradesh is expected \nto  receive  an  additional  amount  of  around  $4 billion  during  2016\u20132020  as  a  result  of  the \nFourteenth Finance Commission award. GOHP thus, has ample fiscal space to fund the project. \nSuccessful project implementation will reduce the high dependence on government jobs among \nthe youth of the state and, eventually, the pressure on the wage bill. Strengthening of the state\u2019s \nTVET  institutional  framework,  convergence  across  programs  run  by  different  departments, \nreduction of duplication, and better quality of training will yield additional fiscal savings over time. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nA detailed financial management assessment was conducted for DOP, HPKVN, DOTE, \nDOHE, and PWD. The overall project risk is moderate primarily because HPKVN is a relatively \nnew  organization,  which  is  still  in  the  process  of  setting  up  comprehensive  systems  and \nprocesses.24 Several measures have already been taken since its establishment in  September \n2015, including the preparation of standard operating protocols for core functions; the recruitment \nof    experienced  staff  to  handle  training,  procurement,  finance,  and  accounts  functions;  the \nappointment  of  internal  and  external  auditors;  the  approval  of  its  first  set  of  audited  financial \nstatements; and the establishment of an audit committee. However, some additional measures \nproposed in the financial management action plan will be required to manage potential risks as \nthe training programs and related project activities are scaled up. These include (i) preparation of \na comprehensive financial and accounting manual; (ii) capacity building of implementing agency \nstaff  in  project  accounting,  reporting,  and  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  disbursement \nprocedures;  and  (iii)  refinement  of  the  MIS.  The  detailed  financial  management  action  plan  is \ngiven  in  the  PAM,  based  on  which  the  expected  financial  management  arrangements  are \nexpected to be satisfactory. \n \n\n                                                \n23  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Financial  Management  Assessment,  and  Governance  and  Institutional  Structure:  Himachal  Pradesh  Skills \n\nDevelopment Project (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state\u2019s  DOP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe project is pro-poor and gender-focused. The target trainees are the needy urban and \nrural  youth  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  those  enrolled  in  government  colleges,  ITIs,  and \npolytechnics. Training will focus on trades for which demand is growing, such as pharmaceuticals, \nfood  processing,  and  light  manufacturing  in  the  secondary  sector,  and  on  retail,  tourism  and \nhospitality, banking and financial services, and health care in the tertiary sector. Support will be \nprovided to boost the livelihoods of the urban and rural poor through a package of training and \nbusiness development support at the CLCs and RLCs. By locating the new polytechnic in Rehan, \nKangra,  the  project  will  improve  access  for  girls  who  reside  in  the  hilly  northern  districts  of \nHimachal Pradesh. Provision of hostel facilities in the CLCs will enable girls of small towns and \nrural areas to access good-quality training. Production centers in some of the RLCs will support \nlocal  small  businesses.  Gender-sensitive  counseling  and  outreach  material  will  be  prepared. \nThese measures will ensure that the women workforce participation rate does not decline with \nthe urbanization of Himachal Pradesh\u2019s economy.25 All relevant output and outcome indicators \nhave separate targets for women and for people with disabilities. Given these significant gender \ntargets and features, the project is categorized as gender equity theme (GEN). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n27. \ncategories are as follows:26  \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  GOHP  has  assured  ADB  that  the  proposed  new  training \nfacilities will be built within premises owned by it. The potential environmental impacts identified \nare generally site-specific, reversible, and will mostly occur during construction when mitigation \nmeasures can be readily implemented. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). No new land will be acquired, nor will anyone be \n29. \ndisplaced  in  anticipation  of  ADB  funding.  It  will  be  ensured  that  the  subproject  sites  are \nencumbrance free and have no squatters or livelihood issues. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Lahaul  Spiti  and  Kinnaur  are  two  districts  in  the \n30. \nnorthern  part  of  Himachal  Pradesh  where  tribal  members  are  the  majority.  Given  their  high \naltitude,  inhospitable  terrain,  harsh  winters,  sparse  population,  and  poor  connectivity,  no  civil \nworks are planned in these districts. Hence, the project will have no adverse effect on tribals. \n \n31. \nSixteen sites identified by the GOHP were screened and cleared by environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  consultants.  An  environmental  and  social  management  framework  has  been \nprepared to guide  the  civil  works.  Initial  environmental  examination reports  and corresponding \nenvironmental management plans have already been prepared for several subproject sites. The \nimplementing  agencies\u2019  staff  were  sensitized  about  the  policies  and  procedures  of  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  They  will  participate  in  the  periodic  capacity-building  workshops \norganized by ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission on environmental and social safeguards. \n                                                \n25   In 2011\u22122012, Himachal Pradesh\u2019s labor force participation rate was 63% for rural women but only 28% for urban \n\nwomen. It was 87% for rural men and 73% for urban men. \n\n26    ADB.

Hence, \nthe benchmarks shown in this design and monitoring framework have been modified based on Himachal Pradesh\u2019s \nsocioeconomic and demographic profile, and the extra constraints it faces because of its hilly terrain. \n\nc  According to the 2016 Common Norms, in the case of wage employment and recognition of prior learning, candidates \nshould  be  placed  in  jobs  that  provide  wages  at  least  equal  to  minimum  wages  prescribed,  and  such  candidates \nshould continue to be in jobs for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of placement in the same or a higher \nlevel with the same or any other employer. In the case of self-employment, candidates should have been employed \ngainfully in livelihood enhancement occupations, which are evidenced in terms of trade license or setting up of an \nenterprise or becoming a member of a producer group, or proof of additional earnings (bank statement) or any other \nsuitable and verifiable document as prescribed by the state government. The M&E consulting firm to be engaged \nunder the loan will assist HPKVN and other implementing agencies in tracking the outcomes of the training programs \nby undertaking surveys and studies.  \n\nd  HPKVN launched a pilot program for training 1,000 youth in 2016. Hence, the baseline is 1,000. \ne  The 2016 baseline is 0 since bachelor of vocational education courses will be introduced under this project. \nf   The  Rehan  polytechnic  will  raise  annual  training  capacity  by  720  and  have  hostel  facilities  for  120  trainees.
