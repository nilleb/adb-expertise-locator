The overall objective is to support the country\u2019s development goals in \nimproving access to economic opportunities  and social services, particularly for those living in the \nouter islands. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCountry context. Kiribati is one of the most remote and geographically dispersed countries \nin the world. It has 33 small islands  spread  across 3.5 million square  kilometers of ocean. About \n55% of Kiribati\u2019s total  population  of 115,847 live in the main island of Tarawa, which includes the \ncapital, South Tarawa; the remaining inhabitants  are spread across the outer islands. 2 These are \nlow-lying atolls  that are  highly exposed  to the  effects of climate change, including  sea level  rise \nand more intense  rainfall and  wind from tropical cyclones. 3 Access to goods  and  services in  the \nouter  islands  is  limited.  Many inhabitants  are  moving to the  more urban  capital,  which provides \njobs, access to higher education, and specialized  social services. \n \n4. \nSafe and resilient  transport infrastructure is essential  for connecting Kiribati\u2019s  population to \neconomic opportunities  and social services, particularly for those living in the outer islands.  Such \ninfrastructure is also key to achieving the government\u2019s objective to stop migration from the outer \nislands  to  Tarawa,  which  is  already  overcrowded and  congested. 4 Stopping  migration  requires \nsubstantive  improvements in (i) the safety of interisland  maritime navigation;  (ii) the resilience  of \nouter island  access infrastructure; and (iii) the institutional  capacity of key government agencies: \nthe Ministry of Information, Communication, Transport and Tourism Development (MICTTD); and \nthe Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable  Energy (MISE). \n \nTransport sector  challenges.  The  safety  of interisland  maritime navigation  is  a  major \n5. \nconcern because  of the lack of nautical  charts, which are necessary for safe navigation  and  for \nprevention  of vessel  groundings  that  can result  in fatalities  and  pollution.  The  government does \nnot  have  the  resources  or  expertise  to  carry out  the  hydrographic surveys  required  to  produce \nnautical  charts.  The  hydrographic  surveys  provide  essential  information  to  plan  and  develop \nmaritime infrastructure, such as the configuration of the seafloor, water depths, and the location of \n\n \n\n1  Kiribati is made up of three island groups: the Gilbert Group, which includes the main island of Tarawa and the capital, \n\nSouth Tarawa; the Phoenix Group; and the Line Group. \n2  World Bank Open Data. Kiribati (accessed 7 January 2020). \n3  An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef with a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. \n4  Government of Kiribati. 2015. Kiribati Development Plan 2016\u201319. Tarawa. \n\n \n\n\faids to navigation (ATON), which are markers to guide vessels. The lack of hydrographic surveys \nconstrains the development of the outer islands. It restrains private sector investments and tourism \nindustry,  disrupts  shipping  of  copra  to  markets, and causes  long  periods  for  resupply  of  basic \ngoods. \n \n6. \nOuter  island  access  infrastructure  is  inadequate  and  lacks  resilience  in  several  key \naspects.  ATONs are  not  designed  to  withstand  harsh  conditions.  Many need  replacement  and \nsome are completely missing. The outer islands lack ship-to-shore berthing infrastructure such as \nboat ramps and jetties, and passengers often must wade through several hundred meters of water \nto  reach  land.  Such  passage  is  particularly  dangerous  for children  and  the  elderly.  Degraded \nisland-crossing  causeways hinder  connectivity and lack climate-resilient  features such as proper \ndrainage and erosion control. \n \n7. \nThe  key  government  agencies  have  inadequate  institutional  capacity  for  sustainable \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure  in  the  outer  islands.  The  MICTTD\u2019s \nMarine  Division  regulates  domestic  and  international  shipping,  provides  ATONs, and  conducts \nsearch-and-rescue  operations.  The  MISE\u2019s  Civil  Engineering  Division  handles  land  transport \ninfrastructure  development  and  maintenance  and  coastal  protection.  Both  divisions  are  under-\nresourced  and lack capacity. There  is  no systematic approach  to maritime sector development, \nsuch as an overall road map and medium- and long-term investment plans. \n \n8. \nClimate change and disaster  resilience. An atoll  nation,  Kiribati  is low-lying  and highly \nvulnerable to climate change and disaster  risks. Climatic conditions  and the impacts of wind and \nwaves  have  contributed  to  the  growing  strain  on  shipping  operations.  In  particular,  improved \nmaritime infrastructure must account for the seasonal  wave climate. Since 2008, several severe \nevents have impacted Kiribati, including  two major ferry accidents caused by rough seas (2009 and \n2018); tropical cyclones (2015 and 2016); extreme tides (2010, 2014, and 2015); and large swells \nbecause  of  strong  winds  (2008).  Climate  change  could  worsen  the  wave  climate.  Safety is  a \nconcern during  the northern trade  wind season  (December\u2013March), when waves are higher and \nlast longer  than in other months. Aside from safety concerns, surface wind-generated  waves can \nimpact maritime infrastructure in many ways, including through coastal flooding during storm wave \nevents,  coastal  erosion  because  of episodic  storm events  and  long-term  changes  in  integrated \nwave climate, and reef morphology. \n \n9. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) has  conducted an  initial  disaster  and  climate risk \nassessment,  which highlights  the project\u2019s  intent  to  mitigate disaster  and climate change  risks.5 \nFollowing the hydrographic surveys (para. 16), ADB will develop a more detailed  assessment and \na detailed design of maritime infrastructure to ensure that project disaster risks are fully assessed, \ndisaster  risk reduction measures identified  and costed, and best practices in building  climate and \ndisaster resilience  reflected in the final design. \n \n10. \nCoronavirus disease  (COVID-19) impacts.  Currently, Kiribati  has  no confirmed case of \nCOVID-19. The project will ensure that contractors are prepared  to mitigate potential  COVID-19-\nrelated risks associated with the movement of labor, materials, and equipment. The impact of the \nproposed  project will contribute positively to the government\u2019s effort to secure safe movement of \ncritical supplies  and people  between Tarawa and the outer islands.  Transport  connectivity is key \nfor trade, and  maritime infrastructure supported  under this  project will not only improve maritime \nsafety but also boost economic activity. \n \n\n5  Disaster and Climate Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fAlignment with strategic priorities. The project is in line with the Kiribati 20-Year Vision, \n11. \n2016\u20132036, 6 which sets the country\u2019s development goals and long-term planning framework. The \nvision\u2019s  overall objective is to \u201cbolster national  efforts in transforming the lives of an I-Kiribati and \neconomy into  a resilient,  wealthy, healthy and secure nation.\u201d 7 The project is consistent  with the \nADB  Strategy  2030  priority  to  strengthen  institutional  capacity,  particularly  in  small  island \ndeveloping  countries. 8 The project is  also aligned  with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach in reducing costs \nby improving domestic and regional connectivity through transport infrastructure, managing risks, \nand enabling value creation; and in attaining  the Sustainable  Development Goals. 9 The project is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2020\u20132022  for  11  small  Pacific  island \ncountries. 10 \n \n12. \nLessons. Kiribati\u2019s remoteness has a significant and often unpredictable impact on costs. \nThe difference between the cost estimate at appraisal and the actual contract price can be largely \nattributed to the absence of detailed designs. The project is learning from this and applied a 20%\u2013\n30% contingency (25% average physical contingency) to all estimated civil works, and a buffer in \nthe estimated time lines to factor unforeseen delays. \n \n13. \nExperience in  ADB\u2019s Kiribati  operations  shows  that intensive  implementation  support  will \nbe required throughout the project. It will establish  an outer islands  implementation unit (OIIU) and \nsupport the Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit (KFSU). 11 The project will build the institutional capacity \nof agencies throughout  project implementation and  hold regular videoconferences with the OIIU, \nthe KFSU, and implementing agency focal points as needed. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe project is aligned  with the following impact: improved access to economic and social \ninfrastructure  in  the  outer  islands  (footnote  6).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nimproved safety and resilience of transport connectivity in Abaiang, Beru, Nonouti, and Tabiteuea \nSouth. 12 \n  \n15. \nThe government prioritized  the four islands  because either they have no infrastructure or, \nif they do, it is  more dilapidated  than that  of other outer islands. 13 The  project will be cofinanced \nby ADB and the World Bank to achieve the following outputs: \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Safety  of  interisland  navigation  improved.  The  project  will  produce \nhydrographic  surveys  and  nautical  charts  for  the  four  target  islands  to  significantly  improve \nnavigation  safety. The  output  will  inform the  design  of the  project-financed maritime works and \nenable investments in developing other maritime infrastructure. The hydrographic surveys will lead \nto more climate-resilient spatial planning by establishing  a detailed baseline to monitor the impacts \nof climate change on marine resources, reefs, and the coastline. \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n6  Government of Kiribati. 2015.

The project will \n(i) improve ship-to-shore navigation safety by replacing defective ATONs, fabricating and installing \nnew  ATONs,  and  establishing  a  system  of  maintenance;  (ii)  rehabilitate \nisland  access \ninfrastructure  to  meet  the  needs  of  women,  minors,  and  older  people  by  constructing  jetties, \nconcrete boat ramps, and shelters;  and (iii) improve intraisland  connectivity by providing technical \nsupport for building  multipurpose maritime facilities and rehabilitating  island-crossing  causeways. \nResilient  design  measures  and  construction  materials  will  be  used  to  increase  infrastructure \nresilience to extreme tides,  storm surge, and other identified disaster  risks. \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Enabling  environment  strengthened.  The  project  will  (i)  strengthen  the \nMICTTD\u2019s and the MISE\u2019s institutional  and regulatory functions for transport by providing technical \nsupport and training to improve the ministries\u2019 skills in managing transport infrastructure to be built \nunder the project; and (ii) identify and prepare priority maritime projects for investment. The output \nwill  help  build  greater  institutional  capacity  to  design,  implement,  and  maintain  transport \ninvestments.  Capacity  building  will  include  contingency  planning,  extreme  weather  maritime \nmanagement, and resilient  operation and maintenance practices. \n \nC. \n \nADB  has  extensive  experience  in  tackling  the  needs  and  challenges  of  the  Pacific\u2019s \n19. \ntransport, and the proposed engagement in Kiribati\u2019s maritime transport will help build capacity in \ngovernment agencies. The  project will provide a natural  platform for sector-related development \npartner coordination  among the government, ADB, and  other development partners.  Support for \ngender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  is  central  to  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment. 14 The project will consider the project area\u2019s gender issues, such as accessibility to \npublic  services  by women  and  extremely high  rates  of gender-based  violence  (GBV), and  will \npropose actions to promote gender equality. \n \n20. \nThe project continues ADB\u2013World Bank cooperation in Kiribati, which began in 2010, when \nthe Kiribati Road Rehabilitation  Project was approved; in 2017, it was successfully implemented.15 \nThe  approach  adopted  by both  cofinanciers has  laid  the  groundwork for  the  proposed  project. \nCofinancing is  a useful way to lower  the risk from the  government\u2019s inadequate  implementation \ncapacity by reducing the workload, avoiding burdensome  duplicated procedures,  and shortening \nprocessing  times.  ADB\u2019s  significant  contributions  to  the  project,  including  project  preparation \ntechnical  assistance  to  ensure  high  project  readiness,  supplemented  and/or  complemented the \nWorld Bank\u2019s services. 16 \n \nD. \n \n21. \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration  manual (PAM). 17 \n \n22. \nFund resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $42.0  million  (Table  1).

The OIIU is  expected to rely on the \nKFSU  for  procurement  and  financial  support.  Under  the  MFED\u2019s  oversight,  the  KFSU  has \nsupported  ADB- and World Bank\u2013financed projects on procurement, financial management, and \noverall coordination. Several positions  within the KFSU were recruited through such projects. \n \n26. \nAs the project includes lead cofinancing from the World Bank, it will follow ADB\u2019s alternative \nprocurement arrangements detailed  in the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time), and universal procurement will apply. 19 Following the procurement framework agreement \nbetween ADB and the World Bank dated 3 December 2018, a project implementation agreement \nwill  be  signed  under  which  the  World  Bank  will  be  designated  as  the  lead  cofinancier  for  all \nprocurement-related  activities  under  the  project. 20 This  means  that  World  Bank  policies, \nregulations,  rules, and instructions will apply to the procurement of all goods, works, and services \nunder the project. The World Bank will provide implementation support and monitor procurement \nactivities. It will report to ADB as required  by the procurement framework agreement and project \nimplementation agreement. \n \nSince ADB and  the  World  Bank will  be  jointly  financing selected  procurement contracts \n27. \nunder the project, the debarment lists of ADB and the World Bank will need to apply to the project\u2019s \njointly financed contracts. The agreement for mutual enforcement of debarment decisions dated 9 \nApril  2010  between  ADB and  other  multilateral  development  banks,  including  the  World  Bank, \nenables ADB to cross-debar entities debarred by other multilateral development banks. However, \nonly debarments that meet certain conditions\u2014e.g., when the period of debarment is more than 1 \nyear\u2014are eligible for cross-debarment. As the World Bank has debarred entities that ADB has not, \napproval  by the  ADB Board of Directors  is  sought  to  apply  the  World  Bank\u2019s  debarment  list,  in \naddition to ADB\u2019s debarment list, to jointly financed contracts under the project. \n \n28. \nthe PAM (footnote 17). \n \n\nThe  implementation arrangements  are  summarized in  Table  3 and  described  in detail  in \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nSeptember 2020\u2013June 2026 \n30 June 2026 \n31 December 2026 \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MICTTD and MISE \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nDCC (Infrastructure Committee) with secretary to cabinet (chair), MFED, \nMICTTD, MISE, MELAD, MIA, MWYSSA \nMFED \n\n1 contract \n\nOuter island implementation unit (10 staff members) \nOpen competitive bidding \n(internationally advertised) \n2 contracts \nRequest for quotations \n510 person-months \nQuality- and cost-based selection \n  36 person-months \nConsultants qualifications selection \n120 person-months \nSingle source selection \n384 person-months \nIndividual consultant selection \nUKHO contract for hydrographic surveys and nautical charts \n\n$5.36 million \n\n$0.06 million \n$3.73 million \n$0.14 million \n$0.47 million \n$0.61 million \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting  \n\n \n\n19 ADB.  2013.

These include \nsmall  passenger  terminals  in  each of the  four project  islands,  a jetty,  small-scale dredging,  and \nramps for small boat retrieval. If designed and built  properly, the infrastructure will be robust and \ndurable, and the structures require minimal maintenance once they are handed over to the island \ncouncils.  The  structures  risk  being  directly impacted  by the  effects of climate  change,  such  as \nflooding inundation,  more frequent and intense high tides, extreme storms, overtopping and storm \nsurge,  and  more  frequent  and  intense  coastal  erosion  and  sedimentation.  These  risks  will  be \nincorporated into the design during the detailed design phase of the works. \n \n30. \nTechnical due diligence  aims to  increase resilience  to  disasters  and  climate change. If a \ndisaster were to occur under current conditions, foreign aid vessels would not be able to reach the \nshores of the outer islands  because the lagoons  are unsafe to navigate. Producing nautical charts \nand upgrading ATONs will resolve this issue and make the outer island lagoons  navigable. \n \nB. \n \n31. \nEconomic viability.  The  nature of the proposed  activities  varies. Hydrographic surveys, \nfor example,  are  essential  for  establishing  digital  chart  coverage  of the  outer  islands  to  make \nnavigation  safer, but they do not lead  to additional  income or direct reduction in operating  costs. \nThese small-scale maritime interventions  are needed  to improve the delivery of basic goods and \nservices. Because of this variation, the standard demand analysis for calculating economic viability \nis  not applicable  for all  project components. The economic analysis  was carried out using  least-\ncost  analysis,  cost-effectiveness  analysis,  or  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  for  individual  components, \ndepending on whether their benefits were quantifiable. The hydrographic surveys and the maritime \ninfrastructure components used the cost-effectiveness analysis, which suggested airborne surveys \nas the  most cost-effective hydrographic survey method. For maritime infrastructure, the analysis \nsuggested  as  the most cost-effective interventions a new ramp, shelter, and on-ramp pontoon in \nAbaiang; the dredging of an approach channel and turning basin in Beru; and new shelters,  ATON \nworkshops and winches, and maintenance and  storage of small boats  in Nonouti  and Tabiteuea \nSouth.  The  rehabilitation  of island-crossing  causeways  used  the  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  because \nuser costs and benefits could be quantified as vehicle operating and travel time cost savings. The \n11  causeways  to  be  rehabilitated  are  unsealed  and  carry about  445  vehicles  per  day,  mostly \nmotorcycles (94%) and small trucks. Owned by island councils or private owners, the trucks mainly \ntransport students  to and from school, and are hired to transport coconuts, wood, gravel, or sand, \nand  to  deliver  cargo from landing  sites  and  airports  to  villages.  The  motorcycles are mainly for \nwork-related trips and small-scale cargo movements. The estimated average daily traffic growth is \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nfor  sustainably  maintaining \n\nFinancial  sustainability.  The  additional  budget \n\n2.0%  per year for all  vehicles. The analysis  suggests  that  the proposed  interventions  for island-\ncrossing causeways are economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 10.9%. 21 \n \n32. \nthe \ninfrastructure built under the project will be 1%\u20137% of the annual recurrent budgets of the MICTTD \nand  the  MISE.  Capacity  and  allocation  for  maintenance  are  insufficient,  which  will  pose  a \nsubstantial  risk to the financial sustainability  of the investments and assets built under the project. \nThe project will include a capacity-building component to enable  the MISE and the island  council \nresponsible  for maintenance to establish  maintenance competence in the outer islands. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nThe project will help reform the way that maintenance is financed and programmed for the \nasset  types (i.e.,  ATONs, island  access infrastructure, causeways) improved by the  project. For \nresilient outer island access infrastructure, the project will provide (i) on-the-job training to unskilled \nworkers recruited to carry out rehabilitation  works and routine maintenance; and (ii) training to the \nMISE  and  island  council  personnel  on  inspection  and  reporting,  identification  of  maintenance \nneeds,  and  physical  delivery  of  routine  maintenance  activities.  The  design  of  all  maritime \ninfrastructure installed  will be informed by current projections of how climate change may impact \nthe asset\u2019s  sustainability. \n \n34. \nAn asset management information system is being implemented by the MFED to cover all \ngovernment assets,  including  facilities proposed  by the  project, to support  the  sustainability  and \nmaintenance of assets  after project completion. \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  conducted  in  November  2019  followed  ADB \nguidelines  in the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: \nA  Methodology  Note. 22  The  assessment  considered  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies,  including  fund-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial \nreporting systems, budgeting, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The assessed pre-\nmitigation  financial management risk is  substantial mainly because  of (i) inadequate  attention  to \nrepairs  and  maintenance,  which will  undermine  the  sustainability  of  investments;  (ii)  delays  in \ncompliance with financial management reporting requirements; (iii) delays in processing claims for \ndisbursements  because  of  the  KFSU\u2019s  inadequate  staff  and  financial  resources;  and  (iv)  the \nabsence  of internal  audit.  The  MFED, the  MICTTD, and  the  MISE have agreed  to  implement a \nfinancial management action plan (in the PAM) to resolve the deficiencies. \n \n36. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and  the MFED. The  specific policy requirements  and  supplementary measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe  project is  categorized  effective gender  mainstreaming,  and  two of the three  outputs \nhave gender indicators.

The gender action \nplan will (i) improve women\u2019s access to services and economic opportunities  in the outer islands, \nand  (ii)  promote safe job  and  professional  development  for women in  the  transport  sector.  The \nproject  was  screened  using  the  World  Bank\u2019s  GBV risk assessment  tool  and  was  classified  as \nhaving  moderate  risk.  Considering  the  moderate  risk category and  the  high  underlying  rates  of \nGBV and  violence  against  children  in  Pacific island  countries,  the  project  will  develop  a  GBV \nframework and undertake several activities to prevent and respond to GBV. \n \nF. \n \n38. \ncategories are as follows. 23 \n \n39. \nEnvironment (category B). ADB and the World Bank have agreed on a common approach \nto  safeguards  to  ensure  compliance with their  policies  and  country safeguards.  The project  will \nhave site-specific impacts and few, if any, are irreversible. However, mitigation and management \nmeasures  can be  readily designed  and implemented for most impacts. Following  the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, an environmental and social management framework for the overall project and \nan  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  (ESIA)  for  selected  components  have  been \nprepared.  The  ESIA  is  equivalent  to  an  initial  environmental  examination  that  is  required  for \ncategory  B  projects.  The  impacts  are  limited  to  the  footprint  of  small-scale  land  maritime \ninfrastructure in the  outer  islands  (including  ATONs, a jetty,  passenger  terminals,  concrete boat \nramps, and  shelters,  and  the rehabilitation  of island-crossing  causeways), and can be  mitigated \nand  managed  to  acceptable  levels,  provided  the  measures  in  the  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  plan  (ESMP) are  implemented,  monitored,  and  reported.  Short-term impacts  are \nanticipated  during  construction,  including  dust,  noise,  and  waste  generated  during  dredging \nexcavation and  civil works  activities,  as  well  as  minor community  and  occupational  health  and \nsafety risks. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, the environmental and social \nmanagement framework, the ESIA and subsequent ESIA, and monitoring reports will be disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website. The contractors will prepare their ESMP based on the ESIA and/or the ESMP. \nThe MICTTD and the MISE, with support from the design and supervision  consultants will review \nand  clear the  contractors\u2019  ESMPs, monitor  the  contractors\u2019  compliance with  their  ESMPs, and \nmonitor the ESMPs\u2019 effectiveness. \n \n40. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Due diligence  confirmed that the project will not \nhave  significant  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  is  not  expected  to  cause  any  physical \ndisplacement and loss of livelihood. Most impacts are associated with resilient outer island access \ninfrastructure from the  loss of coconut trees  and the requirement for new land lease  for selected \nmaritime facilities (component 2). The MICTTD and  the MISE, with support from the design and \nsupervision consultants, will carry out further investigation when the island access infrastructure is \ndesigned  during  project implementation.  Island  access infrastructure-related  works and  facilities \nare expected to use mostly government-leased land. Voluntary lease agreements will be pursued \nfor long-term land use as needed,  such as with the proposed  boat ramp and shelter  at Buariki in \nTabiteuea  South,  and  the passenger  shelter  at  Tebikeriki in Beru.  Minor impacts expected from \n\n23 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fthese proposed sites are the loss of about 12 coconut trees and one toilet structure on government-\nowned  land.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  causeways  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  to  cause \nresettlement impacts as they are unoccupied. Civil works are also not expected to alter the footprint \nof the causeways and approach roads. Improving ship-to-shore  transfers (maritime ATONs) is not \nexpected to have any involuntary resettlement impacts. The MICTTD and the MISE have prepared \na draft resettlement  framework consistent with the  Safeguard Policy Statement and World  Bank \nrequirements to guide the preparation of the resettlement plan and/or due diligence report for the \nmaritime navigation  aids,  following the  findings of the  hydrographic surveys. 24 The MICTTD and \nthe MISE, with support from the consultants  prepared a draft resettlement  plan for the rest of the \nproject components subject  to further updates  following the detailed  design. 25 The MICTTD and \nthe  MISE  consulted  the  affected persons  and  disclosed  draft  safeguard  documents,  and  will \ncontinue consultations during project implementation. \n \n41. \ngroup and the project beneficiaries are not considered distinct and vulnerable. \n \nG. \n \n42. \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan. 26 \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
