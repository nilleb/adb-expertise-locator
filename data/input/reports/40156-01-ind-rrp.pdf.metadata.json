India  has  a  coastline  of  7,525  kilometers  (km)\u20145,425 km \n3. \nalong  the  nine  national  coastal  states  of  the  mainland  and  2,100  km  in  the  union  territories. \nAbout 20%\u201325% of its population lives within 50 km of the coast, with 70% of them residing in \nrural  areas.  All  the  coastal  states  and  territories  are  affected  by  coastal  erosion.  Coastline \nerosion over the years has intensified in the west coast\u2014in the states of Goa, Karnataka, and \nMaharashtra\u2014on  which  the  investment  program  will  focus. 2   In  these  states,  50%  of  the \n1,100 km of coastline is facing erosion; about 530 km are prone to erosion and 330 km require \nprotection.    At  the  current  rate  of  seawall  and  other  constructions  along  the  shorelines,  the \nprime beaches could become almost extinct in the next 20 years. The rise in sea levels and the \nlikely  increased  frequency  and  intensity  of  storms  will  aggravate  the  erosion,  with  serious \neconomic and environmental consequences for coastal states. The sea level rise is projected to \nbe  from  15 centimeters  to  38 centimeters  in  the  Indian  subcontinent  by  the  middle  of  the \ncentury. A rise of 1 meter in sea level is projected to displace 7.1 million people in India, with a \nloss of 5,764 square km of land and 4,200 km of roads. \n \n4. \nCoastal  erosion  is  caused  by  both  natural  (such  as  storms  and  currents)  and \nanthropogenic  (including  dams,  riverbed  quarrying,  harbors,  and  inlet  stabilization)  effects.  In \nIndia,  numerous  examples  show  how  human  activities  have  contributed  to  or  caused  coastal \nerosion. These include change in sediment supply through dredging, river damming, and sand \nmining or the construction of littoral barriers such as groins, jetties, and ports. Beach scour can \nbe caused by seawall construction and loss of vegetation on the shoreline affects erosion rates. \nSediment  traps  (such  as  dredged  navigational  channels)  and  alteration  to  wave  processes \ncaused by jetties and ports also play a role. Urbanization of the coast has exacerbated coastal \nerosion.   \n\n5. \nCoastal  erosion  is  responsible  for  loss  of  land,  houses,  infrastructure,  and  business \nopportunities;  and  poses  a  high  risk  to  human  well-being,  economic  development,  and \necological  integrity.  Every  year,  400  hectares  of  land,  75,000  hectares  of  crop  areas,  and \n34,000 residential  houses  and/or  industrial  establishments  are  lost  or  damaged  by  coastal \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Preparing  the  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and  Management \n\n2   These  three  states  were  selected  after  consulting  the  states  and  central  government,  and  considering  coastal \n\nProject. Manila.  \n\nerosion and instability status in these states.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nerosion. The impact will be much more extensive and widespread in the coming years, as the \ncoastline  is  increasingly  subject  to  a  wide  range  of  economic  developments,  many  of  which \ncreate conflicts and pressures on the already disturbed natural coastal environments. The rural \npoor  coastal  communities  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  erosion  and  poor  coastal \nmanagement.  Many  of  India\u2019s  rapidly  growing  urban  areas  are  also  vulnerable  to  coastal \nerosion; Mumbai, for example, incurs a cost of about $2.5 million per km on capital works alone \nto protect some of its prime waterfront property. \n\n The coastal protection strategy in India aims at protecting the land and overall economic \n6. \ngrowth.  Protecting  the  beach  and  the  environment  are  relatively  new  concepts.    The  most \nfrequently applied methods for coastal protection have been through the use of hard structures, \nsuch as seawalls or groins. Long-term plans to manage coastal erosion are available. However, \nresource  constraints  result  in  the  measures  being  undertaken  to  target  the  more  vulnerable \nsections  of  the  coasts  and  as  local  emergency  measures.  Such  interventions  provide  mostly \nland  protection.    Seawalls  and  groins  continue  to  be  preferred  measures  though  they  do  not \nnecessarily address the root cause of the problem.  As the pressure on the coastal zone keeps \nexpanding  because  of  human-induced  activities  as  well  as  relative  sea  level  rise,  there  is  an \nurgent need to find sustainable solutions for coastal protection.  \n \n7. \nDevelopment  opportunities.  Continuing  coastal  erosion  worldwide  is  leading  to  the \ndevelopment  and  installation  of  innovative  techniques  for  effective  and  unobtrusive  shoreline \nand  near  shore  control.  There  are  increasing  examples  of  replacement  or  modification  of \ntraditional  hard  rock  protection  with  softer  options  such  as  beach  nourishments,  dune \nmanagement, or artificial reefs. The investment program is designed to facilitate the transition to \nsofter solutions, with a focus on environmentally appropriate and sustainable solutions.  \n \n8. \nThe benefits of coastal projection to coastal economies are enormous. Interventions to \nprevent coastal erosion and protect beaches and adjoining land will benefit port operators and \nusers, fisherfolk, tourism operators, beach users, farmers, and other property owners and local \ncommunities  living  near  to  or  depending  on  the  coast.  In  addition,  the  introduction  and \ndevelopment of new technologies have lower environmental and social impacts than rock walls, \nwhich  are  the  traditional  solution  to  coastal  erosion  problems  in  India.  When  solutions  include \nthe  construction  of  artificial  reefs,  there  are  benefits  for  beaches,  land  and  property  behind \nbeaches,  tourism,  and  artisanal  fisheries  since  reefs  provide  a  beneficial  habitat  for  fish  and \nother marine species. The introduction of these new technologies for coastal protection leads to \nsolutions  that  not  only  protect  the  coastline  from  erosion  but  enhance  income-generating \nopportunities for communities living near the affected areas. \n\n9. \nStrategic context. A key theme of the government\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012 is \nthe integration of environmental concerns into policy, planning, and development activities. The \nplan also underscores the need to address the impacts of sea level rise, particularly for coastal \nagriculture, as well as the management of seawater ingress into coastal areas. Considering the \ngovernment\u2019s development priorities, the country partnership strategy of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for India, 2009\u20132012 emphasizes sustainable measures for coastal protection with \na focus on the enhanced capacity of state authorities to design, implement, monitor, and finance \ncoastal protection and management measures.3 \n\n10. \nInstitutional  environment.  The  mandate  for  coastal  erosion  mitigation  is  typically \nentrusted  to  the  state  level  coastal  division,  which  is  part  of  a  larger  state  department  with  a \nmuch broader and largely technical mandate. The technical and human-resource capacity of the \n                                                \n \n3  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n\n\fcoastal  divisions  is  limited,  with  minimal  experience  in  modern  and  sustainable  coastal \nprotection and management measures. Integrated management and the use of environmentally \nand  socially  acceptable  solutions  for  coastal  protection  require  effective  local  level  community \nparticipation.  The  processes  for  these  solutions  are  presently  limited  and  new  methodologies \nwill have to be developed to meet these requirements. Maintenance is a key issue; a high level \nof  local  support  for  maintenance  is  required  in  some  areas,  such  as  beach  stabilization  work. \nDevelopment  of  protection  works  could  open  up  opportunities  for  communities  and  other \nstakeholders, with some initial support, to help realize potential financial benefits.  \n\n11. \nInvestment  plan.  The  three  states  have  envisaged  an  investment  plan  of  about \n$700 million  for  coastal  protection  and  management  over  the  medium  term.  An  adjustment  to \nthe long list based on prioritization of subprojects has been carried out for financing under the \ninvestment  program. All subprojects to be included under the investment program  will have to \nmeet the selection criteria: (i) erosion status; (ii) technical, institutional, and economic feasibility; \n(iii)  compliance  with  safeguards  requirements;  (iv)  endorsement  by  stakeholders,  including \nagreements to support the project; and (v) state priority. \n\n12. \nRoad  map.  A  road  map  (a  sector  strategy),  comprising  the  policy  and  institutional \nactions  and  an  investment  program,  has  been  prepared  to  support  the  states  to  move  toward \nintegrated and sustainable coastal protection and management. The objective of the road map \nis  to  reduce  coastal  erosion  and  instability  in  the  states.  The  road  map  envisages  actions  to \nprotect and manage the shorelines of the three states, meeting the needs of communities and \nother stakeholders, while maintaining the environmental integrity of the shorelines. \n\nPolicy  framework.  The  1991  CRZ  notification;  Environment  Protection,  Act  1986;  a \n13. \nnumber  of  other  policies,  legislations  and  notifications;  and  the  state  level  shoreline \nmanagement  plans  (SMPs)  provide  an  ample  policy  framework  for  implementation  of  the \ninvestment program. The government is considering further regulatory improvement because of \nthe new challenges that are likely to arise from climate change-induced sea level rise and the \ngrowing  pressures  of  population  on  coastal  resources  and  biodiversity.  To  support \nimplementation of the investment program, the states have identified some policy improvements \nat state level as part of the agreed sector road map. These include preparation of state SMPs, \nopening  the  way  for  increased  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  in  coastal  protection, \nestablishment  of  processes  and  procedures  for  approvals  of  coastal  infrastructure  plans  and \ndesigns, and a sustainable operation and maintenance program for coastal protection. \n \nLessons  identified.  Lessons  from  coastal  interventions  in  India  and  other  countries \n14. \nhave  been  examined  and  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  investment  program.  Worldwide \nexperience shows that traditional methods of shoreline protection using hard structures cannot \nbe supported as long-term strategies. Key lessons include (i) using environmentally and socially \nappropriate  solutions;  (ii)  better  planned  and  designed  coastal  infrastructure;  (iii) involving \nregional  governments  and  local  communities  in  planning,  design,  and  implementation; \n(iv) devising  innovative  community  support  program  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  coastal \nprojects;  (v)  giving  importance  to  flood-prone  agricultural  land;  (vi)  assessing  the  intangible \nbenefits  and  their  overall  economic  efficiency  in  terms  of  least-cost  options;  and  (vii) retaining \ntrained and experienced staff in the target institutions and institutional development.   \n\n15.  Multitranche financing facility. The MFF modality is the most suitable lending modality \nfor  effective  implementation  of  the  investment  program,  which  requires  9  years.  All  the \nsubprojects,  selected  or  long-listed,  are  similar  in  nature  in  terms  of  designs  for  coastal \nprotection  solutions,  and  in  implementation  arrangements.  The  MFF  modality  will  be  more \neffective  than  the  regular  loan  modality  in  meeting  client  needs,  while  facilitating  stronger \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\npartnership,  and  in  implementation  performance.  The  MFF  provides  the  opportunity  and \nincentives for high implementation quality since future tranches are subject to the performance \nof the ongoing tranche, and sufficient readiness for implementation. It will foster (i) the progress \nof  the  agreed  incremental  institutional  actions;  (ii)  the  implementation  with  assessment  and \nincorporation of lessons learned during the previous tranches; and (iii) sound capacities of the \nstate  executing  agencies  (SEAs)  to  proceed  with  necessary  reforms,  which  were  prepared \nduring the project preparation process.  \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  There  has  been  limited  external  assistance  for  coastal \n16. \nprotection  and  management  in  India.  Nearly  all  investment  funding  has  been  from  the  states, \ncentral  government,  and  the  private  sector.  The  lack  of  external  assistance  has  resulted  in  a \nlack  of  exposure  to  new  ideas  and  practices.  The  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  and  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  currently  working  in \npartnership with ADB in coastal protection and management initiatives in India.4 The World Bank \nrecently approved the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project. The World Bank and ADB \nworked closely to harmonize interventions for coastal protection in India. The focus of the World \nBank\u2019s project is on coastal zone management, mapping, and planning; and piloting integrated \ncoastal zone management in the states of Gujarat, Orissa, and West Bengal. The focus of the \nproposed  ADB-supported  investment  program  is  on  designing  coastal  erosion  protection \ninfrastructure in the states of Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.   \n\n17. \nPrivate  sector. The  shoreline  of  the  states  holds  major  opportunities  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  PPP.  Investors  have  shown  significant  interest  in  the  shoreline  and  beach \nareas,  and  many  investments  are  already  profiting  from  shore  and  coastal  areas.  The \ninvestment  program  will  bridge  the  gap  between  coastal  development  requirements  and \nopportunities  and  the  identification  of  effective  areas  for  partnership,  and  where  appropriate, \npromote  private  sector  involvement.  The  private  sector  role  could  include  (i) contribution  from \nbeneficiaries  for  the  maintenance  of  erosion  protection;  (ii) commercial  sponsorship  of  dune \nmanagement and other natural protection; and (iii) direct investment opportunities for the private \nsector  and  PPP  in  tourism,  marinas,  jetties,  harbors,  dredging,  water  treatment,  land \nreclamation, regeneration, and other areas. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe impact of the investment program will be improved income and reduced poverty of \nthe  coastal  communities  in  the  subproject  areas  of  the  coastal  states  of  Goa,  Karnataka,  and \nMaharashtra.  The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  will  be  protected  and  managed \nshorelines  in  the  three  states,  meeting  the  needs  of  stakeholders  and  protecting  the \nenvironment. The key performance target is protecting and managing 150 km of coastline with \ncommunity and private sector participation. The project 1 of investment program would meet the \nrequirements of 10 km of the coast.   \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB  and  the  GEF  are  working  to  develop  a  project  proposal  to  address  climate-resilient  sustainable  coastal \ninfrastructure  protection  and  management  in  India.  The  GEF  project  will  complement  the  investment  program \nthrough  systemic  support  activities  designed  to  support  sustainable  shoreline  planning  and  management  of  the \nentire  coastline  of  the  three  states,  with  site-specific  investments  in  coastal  protection  measures.  Capacity \ndevelopment  for  sustainable  coastal  protection  and  management  supported  by  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  included  in  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Advanced  Project \nPreparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila.   \n\n\fC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  investment  program  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  outputs: \n19. \n(i) developed  sustainable  plans  and  management  for  shorelines,  (ii)  reduced  coastal  erosion \nand instability, and (iii) enhanced capacity for shoreline planning and development.  \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Sustainable Plans and Management for Shorelines Developed \n\nOutput 1 includes (i) participatory SMPs; (ii) functional coastal management information \n\n20. \nsystems; and (iii) management, supervision, and planning of subprojects. \n\n21. \nParticipatory  shoreline  management  plans.  SMPs  will  be  prepared  to  meet  long-\nterm shoreline management needs. Participatory and integrated SMPs, with the participation of \nwomen, will be produced for the coastlines of the three states. Shoreline plans will address key \nissues  of  the  coastal  processes,  shoreline  land  use,  and  present  proposals  for  the  long-term \nsustainable  management  and  protection  of  the  shoreline.  The  plans  will  also  identify  potential \neconomic development opportunities in coastal areas. \n\nCoastal  management \n\ninformation  systems.  Coastal  management \n\n22. \ninformation \nsystems will be developed and established within each SEA, with linkages to central agencies. \nThe  databases  will  source  information  from  national  and  state  level  institutions  and  other \nspecialized  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests.  These  will  establish \neffective mechanisms for sharing information with state and district level coastal agencies and \nstakeholders. Maintenance of the management information system will be a key responsibility of \nthe coastal information management units (CIMUs) to be established within each SEA.  \n\n23.  Management  and  planning  of  subprojects.  The  investment  program  will  support \nmanagement and supervision of subproject implementation, and preparation of detailed design \nof  subprojects  for  future  tranches.  Planning  and  design  of  projects  for  implementation  will  be \nselected  based  on  the  outputs  of  the  shoreline  management  planning  process.  Selected \nprojects will be formulated and submitted for preliminary selection and assessment. Feasibility \nstudies, including numerical modeling as required, will be carried out for all projects to assess \ntheir technical and economic viability as well as their social and environmental impacts.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Coastal Erosion and Instability Managed and Reduced \n\n24. \nOutput 2 comprises (i) reducing coastal erosion and instability using environmentally and \nsocially  appropriate  solutions,  and  (ii)  community  and  private  sector  engagement  in  coastal \nerosion and instability reduction.    \n\n25. \nReducing  coastal  erosion,  salinity  and  instability.  Coastal  erosion,  salinity  and \ninstability  will  be  reduced  through  economically  viable  protection  works,  using  environmentally \nand socially appropriate solutions. Key areas of other coastal protection interventions include (i) \nnavigation  inlets  and  training  of  river  and  drain  mouths;  (ii)  natural  protection  through  the \ndevelopment  and  planting  of  dunes,  and  planting  of  mangrove  or  other  trees  for  protection  or \nshelter; and (iii) coastal management, including water quality, dredging, and reclamation.  \n\n26. \n Community and private sector engagement. The key components will be (i) training \nprovided  to local communities in  shoreline  management  and  income-generating  activities,  and \n(ii)  new  initiatives  toward  income  generation  of  local  communities.  The  states  will  take  steps \ntoward encouraging private sector investments in coastal protection and management, including \nputting  in  place  enabling  policies  and  guidelines  for  private  sector  participation  in  coastal \nprotection and management as feasible.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nOutput 3: Enhanced Capacity for Shoreline Planning and Development \n\n27. \nOutput  3  includes  (i)  enhanced  capacity  within  districts  and  states  to  design  and \nimplement  projects;  (ii)  enhanced  capacity  of  local  experts  and  agencies,  and  government \ninstitutes;  (iii)  improved  capacity  of  communities  and  stakeholders  to  manage  and  maintain \nbeaches;  and  (iv)  mandated  SEAs  to  coordinate  coastal  infrastructure  projects.  Such  capacity \nenhancement is crucial to realize the policy and institutional actions of the investment program \nroad map.  \n\nEnhanced capacity within districts and states. Capacity at district and state levels will \n28. \nbe  enhanced  to  prepare  and  implement  participatory  SMPs.  CIMUs  will  be  established  and \nshoreline management plans will be prepared and updated at 5 yearly intervals. SMPs will form \nthe basis of long-term shoreline protection and management.  \n\n29. \nEnhanced capacity of local experts and agencies and government institutes.  The \ncapacity  of  local  experts  and  agencies,  local  bodies,  and  stakeholders  will  be  enhanced  to \nprovide  specialist  support  for  planning,  modeling,  design,  checking,  and  review  for  coastal \nprotection and management.  \n\n30. \nImproved capacity of communities and stakeholders. The mandates and capacities \nof  communities  and  stakeholders  will  be  improved  to  manage  and  maintain  the  beaches.  \nLocally  based  community  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  will  support  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring during implementation, and management and maintenance of the beaches.  \n\n31.  Mandated  state  executing  agencies.  The  states  will  take  all  necessary  steps  to \nempower the SEAs to coordinate all coastal management programs. Towards this, the capacity \nof  the  SEAs  will  be  enhanced.

The \nbenefits  of  the  subprojects  are  principally  the  prevented  losses  that  would  occur  without  the \nproject. The investment and ongoing maintenance costs of the subprojects are weighed against \nthese  benefits.  The  main  direct  financial  and  economic  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  the \nprotection of land, buildings, and infrastructure from future  damage caused by coastal erosion \nand  monsoon  storms.  The  protected  land  will  also  increase  the  incomes  and  livelihoods  of \nurban and rural households and businesses located on the coastlines. Tourism, rural farm and \nfishing  households,  ports  and  factories  and  their  owners,  operators,  and  workers  will  benefit \nfrom  the  subprojects.    Removing  the  erosion  risk  will  help  encourage  future  investment  in  the \ncoastal  zone.  The  results  of  the  economic  analysis  show  that  the  subprojects  have  economic \ninternal  rates  of  return  in  the  range  of  15.2%\u201318.9%.    Economic  risks  to  the  viability  of  these \nsubprojects are low, the major risk being large cost overruns.   \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n36. \nThe  financial  management  system  of  the  SEAs  was  assessed  to  ensure  that  the \nfinancial management capacity of the SEAs is adequate to implement the investment program. \nIt has incorporated measures to ensure good governance, accountability, and transparency by \nsetting  out  clear  input  and  output  targets  in  their  implementation  plans.  The  design  and \nimplementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with \nproject management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) engaging \ninternational  and  national  consultants  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices; (ii) introducing a dual signing system in which the civil works contractor awarded the \ncontract  will  also  sign  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  (iii)  periodic  inspection  by \nthe  PMU  of  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and \n\n \n\n\f(iv) setting  up  SEA  websites  to  foster  transparency,  timely  award  of  contracts,  and  uploading \ndetails on project activities and implementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  SEAs.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nAlthough the primary focus of the investment program is on addressing coastal erosion \n37. \nand coastal management, a significant number of the poor are likely to be beneficiaries of the \nsubprojects  because  of  protection  from  losses  and  damages  to  their  land  and  houses,  and \nrestoration  of  their  livelihood  and  incomes.  The  investment  program  will  promote  community \nparticipation  and  income-generating  opportunities,  including  some  gender  benefits.  These \ninitiatives  will  enhance  the  livelihood  of  the  people  directly  affected  by  shoreline  erosion  and \npromote  sustainable  social  development.  Coastal  protection  and  management  programs  will \ncreate  a  number  of  economic  opportunities,  some  of  which  would  have  direct  and  indirect \nbenefits to women. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n38. \nFor each of the two subprojects included in project 1 and one subproject that is likely to \nbe  included  project  2,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  was  carried  out,  along  with  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  the  summary  environmental  impact  assessment.  An \nenvironment  assessment  and  review  framework  has  also  been  prepared  that  would  apply  to \nsubprojects in all tranches under the MFF. Although project 1 has been classified environmental \ncategory  A,  the  interventions  in  many  cases  will  improve  the  natural  environment  of  the \nshoreline  by  stabilizing  and  even  restoring  the  natural  beaches.  Although  serious  negative \nenvironmental impacts are not expected, given the complexity of coastal processes and the new \ntechnologies being employed, the extra level of diligence was needed. Potential adverse effects \nduring  the  construction  phase  can  be  mitigated  and  significant  residual  effects  are  not \nanticipated. Potential adverse effects of proposed structures were considered during the design \nstage and measures were included to minimize them. The environmental management plan will \naddress possible effects during the construction and operation phases. Public consultation and \ndisclosure was completed in each subproject area.  \n \n39. \nThe  interventions  of  the  subprojects    will  be  carried  out  offshore  or  on  the  shoreline. \nThere  are  no  settlements  in  these  areas  and,  as  a  result,  none  of  the  subprojects  will  require \nany  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  of  people.  Project  1  is  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement. A resettlement framework has been prepared in case any resettlement need arise \nin any subsequent tranches.  In the subproject areas, there are no indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminority  groups.  People  who  would  benefit  from  controlling  sea  erosion  have  only  a  few \nunderdeveloped    communities  that  have  largely  been  fully  integrated  with  the  mainstream \npopulation.  The  social,  economic,  linguistic,  and  cultural  characteristics  of  the  various \ncommunities  residing  in  the  subproject  areas  are  mostly  identical.  Project  1  is  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  Indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  in  case  any \nindigenous people are found in any subsequent tranches.  \n  \n  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe investment program involves some risks, which are manageable and will be largely \n40. \nmitigated during implementation. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring.  \n\n41.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.6 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nComplexity of coastal processes \n\nPressure to develop inappropriate \nsolutions \nImplementation delays because the \nmajor interventions can be implemented \nin non-monsoon seasons only \nSustainability of the interventions \n\nMitigating Measures \nProvision has been made for the international panel of experts to \nreview the design and implementation of subproject to ensure \nthe soundness of technical designs and feasibility assessments. \nThe investment program will support only socially and \nenvironmentally acceptable coastal protection solutions. \nThe program activities have been carefully scheduled to avoid \nlengthy delays from extreme weather events. \n\nThe investment program incorporated institutional changes \nrequired for the sustainability of the interventions, including \ndeveloping a self-sustaining and well-resourced shoreline \nmanagement.  \n\n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n42. \nThe  government  and  the  SEAs  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  \ninvestment  program  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  FAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and \nSEAs have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA.
