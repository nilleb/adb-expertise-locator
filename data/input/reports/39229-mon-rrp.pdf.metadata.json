The  Project  will  deliver  these \noutputs  through  three  components:  (i)  value-chain  development \nunder which it will establish a deposit account to guarantee 50% of \nthe  total  amount  of  loans  made  by  private  commercial  banks  to \nagribusiness  enterprises  for  value-chain  development  investment \nplans  (selected  by  the  bank  from  among  a  group  of  prequalified \nplans  with  high  public  goods  elements),  (ii)  a  local  grant  and \ninfrastructure  development  facility  to  develop  rural  infrastructure \nand  services,  and  (iii)  project  management.  In  a  break  with \ntraditional  approaches,  the  Project  will  provide  private  enterprises \nwith  resources  to  undertake  value-chain  investments  that  have \ntypically been undertaken by public agencies. \n \nAgribusiness  development  is  essential  for  developing  agriculture \nin  Mongolia.  While  Mongolian \nand \nimproving  rural  incomes \nagribusiness  enterprises  have \nlittle  quality-  or  price-based \ncomparative  advantage  in  international  markets,  they  do  have  a \ncomparative  advantage  derived  from  the  distinctive  qualities  of \nMongolian  agricultural  products.  This  provides  the  basis  for \ndeveloping  a  brand  that  could  command  a  premium  in  niche \nmarkets.  However,  realizing  niche  market  potential  will  require \ncomprehensive coordinated value-chain development. The Project \nwill achieve this development by providing private enterprises with \nthe  resources  to  undertake  investments  in  the  value  chain \ncoordinated with investments in their own processing facilities. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  agriculture  and  rural  growth  that \nsustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. The \nproject  outcome  is  expected  to  be  a  reliable  supply  of  premium \nvalue Mongolian agriculture products to selected niche markets. \n \n\nincluding taxes and duties of $6.88 million.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \nRecipient \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nProject Investment Plan   The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $47.50  million \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nGrant Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \nADB ADF Grant \nGovernment \nCommercial Banks \nEnterprises \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n14.72 \n  1.41 \n11.00 \n20.37 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n31.0 \n3.0 \n23.2 \n42.8 \n\n47.50 \n\n100.0 \n \n\n \n    ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \n  Source: ADB estimates. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$14,720,000  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  grant  will  be \nsubject to conditions set forth in the draft Grant Agreement. Grant \nfinancing  for  the  Project  is  justified  on  country  considerations. \nBased  on  debt  sustainability  analysis  and  the  revised  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  grants  framework,  Mongolia  is  eligible \nfor 100% of grant financing during 2007\u25002008. ADF grants aim to \nprovide  development  assistance \ntackle \ndevelopment  issues  in  an  environment  of  debt  vulnerability  and \nassist  the  country  in  developing  the  private  sector  creating \nemployment  opportunities  and  achieving  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  without \nincreasing  external  debt  burdens.  Grant \neffectiveness  will  be  assessed  within  the  broader  context  of \nprogram  and  project  performance.  The  design  of  this  Project  and \nits  monitoring  framework  has  clear  indicators  to  measure  the \ninputs, activities, and outputs. \n \nUntil 31 December 2012 \n \n30 June 2012 \n\nthe  country \n\nto  help \n\n \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  Ministry  of  Food  and  Agriculture \n(MoFA) \n \nMOF will be the Executing Agency for the value-chain development \ncomponent.  An  independent  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will \nbe established for this component. Participating commercial banks \nin  collaboration  with  PMU  will  administer  project  loans.  MoFA  will \nbe  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  rural  infrastructure  and  services \ndevelopment  component.  A  PMU  for  this  component  will  be \nestablished  at  MoFA.  Overall  project  coordination  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  a  project  manager  reporting  to  a  project  advisory \nboard. \n \nWith  the  assistance  of  the  value-chain  development  PMU,  where \napplicable,  project  enterprises  will  be  encouraged  to  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nSection  3.12,  and  adopt  appropriate  procurement  procedures. \nProject  enterprises  will  be  encouraged  to  procure  goods  through \ncompetitive  bidding  and  shopping  when  such  procedures  are \napplicable  in  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency.  For  all  other \n\n\f \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nprocurement, contracts for goods estimated to cost more than $0.5 \nmillion  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $1.0 \nmillion  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost \nless than the ICB values but equal to or more than $100,000 will be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance  with  standard  government  procedures  subject  to \nmodifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  using \nshopping  procedures.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all \nprocurement documents and contracts. \n \nThe Project will require 436 person-months of consulting services: \n42  person-months  international  and  394  person-months  national. \nAll  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Technical  experts  will  be  recruited  individually \nby  the  value-chain  development  PMU  as  requested  by  project \nenterprises  to  support  enterprises  in  the  implementation  of  their \ninvestment  plans.  Recruitment  will  be  through  a  cost-sharing \narrangement whereby enterprises requesting experts will bear 60% \nof  the  costs  of  engagement.  The  project  manager,  both  project \ndirectors, and staff of both PMUs will be engaged individually. The \nremaining  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  firms  under  two \npackages  (one  package  each  for  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent  and  the  rural  infrastructure  and  services  development \ncomponent) following quality- and cost-based selection procedures \nusing an 80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio. \n \nThe  Project  will \nrural \ndevelopment in Mongolia. Mongolian agriculture products will claim \nat  least  a  30%  price  premium  over  comparable  products  in  target \nmarkets  by  2015  after  project  investments.  Incomes  of  agriculture \nproducers  participating  in  the  supply  chains  supported  by  the \nProject  will  increase  by  an  average  of  at  least  60%  from  2008  to \n2015.  At  least  2,500  families  are  expected  to  benefit  from  project \ninvestments,  and  investments  by  enterprises  are  expected  to \ncreate  at  least  800  new  jobs.  In  addition  to  its  direct  benefits,  the \nProject  has  substantial  demonstration  benefits.  The  resolution  of \nuncertainties  and  coordination  problems  is  expected  to  induce \nproject  enterprises  to  expand  their  value-chain  investments  by  at \nleast 20% over their project-funded levels within 5 years of project \ncompletion.  The  Project  is  expected  to  induce  at  least  25  more \nto  undertake  similar  value-chain  development \nenterprises \ninvestments within the same time period. Since the premium value \nof Mongolian agriculture products derives from custodianship of the \nenvironment  and  social  responsibility  and,  therefore,  provides \neconomic  incentives  for  environmental  and  social  responsibility, \nthe  Project  is  expected to  have  substantial  positive  environmental \nand social benefits that are difficult to quantify. \n \n\nfoster  sustainable  agriculture  and \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nin \n\nRisks and Assumptions  Risks  to  achieving  project  outputs  arise  from  inadequate  capacity \nof  the  enterprises  to  implement  their  investment  plans,  delays  in \nprocurement  processes,  delivery  delays  by  contractors,  and \nmisuse  of  funds  by  enterprises.  These  risks  will  be  addressed \nthrough  project  management  support.  Project  outcomes  could  be \nat  risk  due  to  inadequate  capacity  of  enterprises  and  farmers, \ncontract  enforcement  issues,  and  inadequate  awareness  of  the \nnature of niche market demand. These risks have been addressed \nthrough careful selection of enterprises, business advisory support \nthrough  PMUs,  and  complementary  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nAgricultural  Marketing  and  Brand  Development.  At  the  highest \nimpact level, risks arise from negative impacts of failures of a few \nenterprises  on  the  reputation  of  Mongolian  businesses  and  \u201cfree-\nriding\u201d  by  low-quality  enterprises.  These  risks  are  addressed \nthrough \nthe \nthe  brand  development  activities  contained \naccompanying  TA  and  project  management  support.  Adverse \nincentives  for  banks  and  enterprises  to  collude  to  capture  project \nfunds  have  been  mitigated  by  providing  for  thorough  assessment \nof  internal  control  mechanisms  of  participating  banks  and  spot \naudits  by  PMU.  The  risk  that  banks  subject  investments  to  less \nthan  full  due  diligence  has  been  mitigated  through  thorough \npreparation  of  investment  proposals  of  project  enterprises  in \naddition to due diligence by banks. The perceived risk that having \nthe  deposit  account  in  the  same  bank  that  makes  the  loans  will \nmake  the  account  vulnerable  to  a  raid  by  the  commercial  bank  is \nnot considered substantial. All the potential risks from moral hazard \nor  adverse  incentives  will  be  additionally  mitigated  by  spot  audits \nperformed by PMU. \n \nThe  associated  TA  of  $2,000,000  equivalent,  proposed  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  for  Agricultural  Marketing  and  Brand \nDevelopment  will  be  directed  to  capitalizing  on  opportunities  in \nniche  markets \nfor  Mongolian \nto  develop  a  premium  brand \nagriculture  products.  The  brand  development  will  be  primarily \naimed  at  developing  partnerships  between  Mongolian  enterprises \nand  external  premium  brands  to  develop  a  virtual  vertically \nintegrated  value  chain.  The  long-term  objective  is  to  provide  an \nopportunity \ntheir  own \nindigenous brands for the export market. The TA will contribute to \nrealizing  the  impact  of  the  Project\u2014agriculture  and  rural  growth \nthat sustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. \nThe outcome of the TA will be the creation of a process for brand \ndevelopment  and  management  that  is  sustainable  and  replicable \nby  the  institutions  charged  with  managing  that  process  while \nproviding  a  demonstration  effect  with  two  leading  enterprises  and \ninvolving other enterprises in the longer-term institutional process. \nTA  outputs  will  be  a  brand  framework,  content  of  business \nproposals,  and  an  institutional  framework  for  sustained  brand \nmanagement  and  development  including  a  business  plan  for  a \nbrand management agency. \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nfor  Mongolian  enterprises \n\nto  develop \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant to Mongolia for the Agriculture and Rural Development Project, and (ii) proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Agricultural Marketing and Brand Development. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  agriculture  sector  is  important  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Mongolia.  The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded  agriculture  sector  strategy 1 contains  a  detailed  sector \nanalysis.  In  2007,  agriculture  accounted  for  20%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP);  40%  of \nemployment;  14%  of  export  earnings;  and  25%  of  GDP  growth.  But  productivity  is  low  and \nproduction  risky  with  less  than  10%  of  production  processed  beyond  the  most  basic  stage. \nGrowth,  mostly  from  higher  livestock  numbers,  has  brought  problems  of  desertification, \npollution, and breed dilution. The result is a stagnant rural economy, poverty, and threats to the \nenvironment.  Market  orientation,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment are objectives of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2006\u20132008.2 Agriculture \nemploys almost half the labor force and is the most important source of income in rural areas \nwhere  43%  of  the  2.5  million  population  live.  In  2003,  rural  poverty  was  estimated  at  43%.  In \naddition to being chronically poor, the rural poor are vulnerable to income shocks. For example, \nduring  2000\u20132001,  severe  weather  killed  large  numbers  of  livestock  and  impoverished  many \nherders.  Rural  incomes  are  tied  to  agriculture  production  patterns,  and  consumption  varies \nnoticeably  with  production  cycles.  Agriculture  and  rural  development,  therefore,  is  crucial  to \nbroadening  and  sustaining  Mongolia\u2019s  growth,  and  providing  opportunities  for  the  many  poor \nwho have not benefited from recent growth. \n \n3. \nAgribusiness  value  chains  are  a  crucial  lever  of  rural  development  and  income \nimprovement  in  Mongolia.  A  range  of  industries  uses  agricultural  raw  materials\u2014meat,  dairy, \nleather,  cashmere,  camel  hair  processing  and  garments,  wool  carpets  and  blankets,  felt \nproducts, and fruit and wild berry products. However, current production (except for cashmere) \nis  a  fraction  of  what  it  was  before  the  transition  to  a  market  economy.  Enterprises  face  keen \ncompetition  from  manufacturers  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  with  surplus  capacity, \neconomies of scale, and government support. Domestic manufacturers confront worsening raw \nmaterial quality (caused by supply chain deficiencies) that affects processing efficiency and the \nquality of end products. An overview of agribusiness is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nOpportunities in Niche Markets \n\n \n4. \nDelivery  of  premium  products  to  niche  markets  by  Mongolian  enterprises  can  induce \nsustained  agricultural  and  rural  growth.  Without  the  development  of  such  a  niche,  Mongolian \nagriculture  will  struggle  in  increasingly  competitive  international  markets  with  severe  negative \nenvironmental and social implications. Mongolian agriculture has little comparative advantage in \ncompeting  on  quality  and  cost  alone.  But  the  sector  can  capitalize  on  the  same  challenging \nqualities  that  suppress  comparative  advantage  to  develop  a  unique  brand  to  create  premium \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Mongolia: Agriculture Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n2   ADB. 2005. Mongolia: Country Strategy and Program 2006\u25002008. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nvalue.  While  Mongolia\u2019s  traditional  production  practices,  harsh  and  fragile  environment,  and \nunique  geography  restrict  the  potential  for  mass,  standardized,  low-cost  production  methods, \nthese qualities offer an opportunity for differentiation for brands that are seeking to differentiate \nand grow as consumers increasingly demonstrate willingness to pay a premium for quality high-\nperformance  products  that  are  authentically,  ethically,  and  ecologically  produced.  Capitalizing \non  these  opportunities,  luxury  brands  are  increasingly  working  with  producers  to  boost  brand \nperceptions and grow. For example, the multibrand RED campaign and the partnership between \nKnorr (Unilever) and Phu Quoc fish sauce have successfully targeted sophisticated consumers. \nSimilarly, Mongolian enterprises can lend characteristics to established premium brand products \nto create powerful themes that can boost brand perceptions and sales. \n \n5. \nPerformance, process, origin, and shared ideology can create niche premium value for \nMongolian  products.  The  strength,  resilience,  and  potency  of  raw  materials  (e.g.,  the  superior \nwarmth  and  softness  of  Mongolian  cashmere,  the  concentrated  nutrients  of  its  wild  berries) \nprovide a strong platform for performance-based value. The unique farming culture and lifestyle \n(e.g., hand-combed cashmere, pasture-reared meat, hand-picked berries) provide the basis for \nprocess-based value. Origins in the unique, mysterious, and remote steppes and forests provide \nthe basis for origin-based premium. Finally, consumers are willing to pay more to become a part \nof something bigger than only consumption\u2014Mongolian products permit consumers to assume \nsome  of  the  unique  spiritual  and  cultural  qualities  of  the  producers  and  feel  that  they  are \ncontributing to some common good or a better world remote from their urban industrial lifestyles. \nThe performance, process, and origin of Mongolian products can be developed and combined \nto  create  credible  and  compelling  brands  with  substantial  price  premiums. 3 For  example,  a \nMongolian  wool  carpet  uses  durable  natural  fibers,  employs  sustainable  processes,  and \noriginates in a unique environment. Mongolian cashmere recognized for performance, process, \nand origin could command a greater premium when imbued with a distinct ideology. \n \n6. \nThe Government has targeted this opportunity in its Ecologically Clean Product Program \nto promote the production and marketing of natural and agricultural products. External partners \nhave attempted to realize this potential through programs for specific products. The Government \nof Switzerland assisted in developing the Camel Act brand for camel milk products. The United \nStates Agency for International Development has worked to develop brand identity around the \nFibremark  cashmere  label.  These  initiatives  have  targeted  success,  but  none  has  achieved  a \nsectorwide impact. Realizing opportunities to create successful premium brands for agriculture \nproducts will require a two-pronged approach to (i) address value-chain constraints to delivering \nthe  quality  and  reliability  expected  by  international  markets,  and  (ii)  increase  the  access  of \nMongolian enterprises to premium markets through brand development. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The most highly rewarded differentiation built on superior performance from a unique process, origin, and ideology \ncan  command  premiums  of  20%  or  more  over  generic  products.  For  instance,  organic  produce  that  is  grown  to \nstrict  environmental  standards  without  chemical  pesticides  or  artificial  fertilizers  and  processed  without  additives \ntypically costs 10%\u201340% more than similar conventionally produced products. Surveys undertaken during project \npreparation indicate that about 40% of consumers are ready to pay a 10% premium for origin-guaranteed products. \nColumbian  coffee  has  successfully  benefited  from  creating  more  than  a  geographic  indicator,  and  its  brand  has \nsold  two  and  a  half  times  more  than  its  category  average  at  a  60%  price  premium.  The  consequences  for \ncooperative  members,  in  terms  of  income,  have  been  remarkable.  Success  stories  from  products  leveraging- \nshared ideology include Wala, the producer of Dr. Hauschka holistic skin care products, which is now a multimillion \ndollar business with thousands of hectares of farmland all over the world providing raw ingredients for the products \nin an environmentally responsible manner and supporting local communities in an economically sustainable  way. \nWith fair trade growing in Britain by 40% per year, brands that are consistent with its philosophy are well placed to \ncapture niches within saturated categories and maintain a good premium. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n   \n\n2. \n\nConstraints to Meeting Niche Market Opportunities \n\n \n7. \nEfforts  to  bring  Mongolian  products  to  international  markets  have  stumbled  because \norders were not met on time or shipments rejected due to quality shortfalls. For example, while \nthe United States Agency for International Development cashmere program had some success \nin  connecting  Mongolian  producers  to  international  markets,  several  program  participants \nstruggled to meet quality and reliability requirements along their value chain including those for \nthe  most  basic  production  and  had  difficulty  in  meeting  and  maintaining  buyer  standards.  The \nchallenges lie in basic production, quality along supply chains, and final production. \n \n8. \nBasic  Production.  Improving  productivity,  quality,  and  reliable  availability  of  primary \nagricultural products is difficult. Partly the result of the harsh climate, production problems are \nalso linked to management, land fertility, production techniques, availability and affordability of \nquality  inputs,  plant  health,  pest  and  disease  issues,  and  application  of  appropriate \ntechnologies.  For  example,  while  local  animals  are  well  adapted  to  deal  with  the  natural \npastures  and  the  severe  climate,  significant  energy  is  needed  to  keep  animals  warm  during \nwinter.  With  only  average  quality  of  feed  from  natural  pastures,  growth  rates  are  slow  without \nsupplementary feeding; and animals are more vulnerable to parasites and infectious diseases. \n \n9. \nQuality  and  Reliability  along  Supply  Chains.  Most  agricultural  supply  chains  are \npoorly organized and equipped with inadequate market information and weak linkages leading \nto uncertainties in quantity, quality, and timing of supply. When the previously centralized supply \nchain infrastructure collapsed, many enterprises ceased operation leaving gaps and inadequate \ninformation flows. Since then, gaps have been filled largely by hundreds of small or one-person \nbusinesses  (locally  known  as  \u201cchangers\u201d)  trading  a  range  of  goods  and  agricultural  materials. \nThe  huge  number  of  people  and  businesses,  the  scatter  of  producers  and  traders  over  large \nareas,  a  general  lack  of  awareness  of  the  needs  of  final  markets,  and  the  lack  of  appropriate \nequipment along the chain have affected the quality of raw materials reaching processors.4 \n \n10. \nInsufficient working capital constrains improvements along supply chains. The ability to \nprovide funding to regular suppliers when they need it most or in times of emergency helps to \nbuild relationships. Traders from the People\u2019s Republic of China often tour supplying areas with \ncash at the time of festivals when producers need cash to purchase traditional gifts. In turn, they \ngain a right to procure raw materials at fixed prices. Cash-strapped Mongolian agribusinesses \ncannot  compete  with  this  liquidity  and,  therefore,  fail  to  build  relationships  with  suppliers. \nFurthermore,  enterprises  have  to  rely  on  cash  flow  to  make  purchases  and  cannot  always \nguarantee that they will pay premiums  for  quality.   Without  guaranteed  funding  for  delivering  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4   The  impact  of  poorly  organized  and  equipped  supply  chains  on  the  quality  of  inputs  used  by  chain  captain \nprocessors can be dramatic. For example, while about up to 50% of the total area of skins purchased by leather \nprocessors  each  year  is  damaged  in  some  way  and,  therefore,  not  usable  for  the  production  of  high-quality \nproducts, trade sources estimate that up to 50% of the damage occurred not while the animal was alive but in the \nsupply chain through a variety of poor practices and arrangements. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\nrequired \n\nhigh-quality  raw  materials,  producers  often do  not take  actions to  improve the  quality of raw \nmaterials. All these factors affect reliability and quality along the supply chains.5 \n \nFinal  Production.  Mongolian  agribusinesses  face  four  key  challenges  in  meeting  the \n11. \nto  develop  sustainable,  higher,  added-value  export  businesses:  \nstandards \n(i) processing technology, (ii) costs, (iii) management capacity and systems, and (iv) customer \nservice.  Many  enterprises  are  operating  with  outdated  or  inappropriate  equipment  from  the \n1970s and 1980s (when Mongolia received significant assistance from Eastern Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union). Output quality and reliability cannot meet international market standards, \nproduction efficiencies are low, energy and other running costs high, and environmental impacts \n(i.e., water use) above international standards. Costs are also high because of low raw material \nquality,  significant  waste,  and  high  cost  of  finance.  Most  companies  have  rudimentary \nmanagement  systems  or  lack  capacity  to  effectively  manage  systems.  Strongly  allied  to  the \nproblems of improving management capacity is the lack of customer service understanding and \nethos among the management of major agroprocessors. Some observers cite this as a critical \nreason  why  Mongolia  has  largely  failed  to  develop  sustainable  large-scale  export  businesses \neven for relatively low added-value products. International buyers experimenting with buying in \nthe country have been deterred by these cultural and attitudinal differences. \n \n\n3. \n\nValue-Chain Development to Meet Niche Market Needs \n\n \n12. \nThese  constraints  cannot  be  addressed  individually.  They  must  be  analyzed  and \naddressed  as  a  comprehensive  value-chain  development  challenge  with  coordinated \nimprovements in basic production, supply chains, and final production. While enterprises have \nmade piecemeal improvements to their production systems in recent years, continuing problems \nof  low  quality  and  unfocused  basic  production  and  problems  in  the  supply  chains  have \nprevented  them  from  stepping  up  production  to  optimal  levels.  Almost  80%  of  the  50  plus \nagribusiness enterprises surveyed during project preparation said that investing in upgrades in \nprocessing  capabilities  would  be  useless  without  improvements  in  raw  material  quality  and \nimproved  certainty  of  supply.  Without  these  investments,  agribusinesses  cannot  secure  long-\nterm contracts and so, cannot pay premium prices to upstream producers and intermediaries for \nassured  supplies  of  quality  raw  materials.  Without  assurances  of  price  premiums  from \ndownstream enterprises, upstream participants in value chains do not invest in improving quality \nand reliability. Almost 90% of surveyed herders and primary producers reported that they would \nrather  leave  quality  issues  to  downstream  buyers  and  accept  lower  premiums  than  invest  in \n                                                 \n5   Banking  dominates  Mongolia's  finance  sector  with  combined  assets  amounting  to  more  than  80%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and more than 90% of finance sector assets in 2006. Banking comprises 16 commercial \nbanks, all of which have been privatized with four having foreign ownership. Following a series of banking crises in \n1994, 1996, and 1998, the financial performance of banks has, in general, improved over the last 3 years; and the \nsubsector  was  profitable  between  2000  and  2006.  Banks  generally  adhere  to  Basel  Core  Principles.  The  total \ncapital-to-asset ratio of banking increased from less than 4% in 1998 to 17% in 2005. Asset quality of banks has \nalso  improved  despite  the  rapid  growth  in  lending\u2014annual  credit  grew  on  average  by  81.5%  between  2000  and \n2005  and  by  42%  in  2006  primarily  driven  by  economic  recovery,  a  more  competitive  financial  market  structure, \nand  foreign  capital  inflows.  The  officially  reported  nonperforming  loan  ratio  declined  from  54%  in  1999  to  9%  in \n2006  while  loan  loss  reserves  increased  in  line  with  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  guidelines.  Notwithstanding  this \nimprovement, banking remains at an early stage of overall development as indicated by the fact that most lending \nis  short  term  and  collateral  based;  and  interest  rates  are  high  reflecting  a  shortage  of  term  funding,  inadequate \ncredit  appraisal  systems  at  many  banks,  and  uncertainties  in  the  law  regarding  nonjudicial  foreclosure.  The \nabsence  of  an  effective  collateral  framework  is  a  key  impediment  to  financial  intermediation.  ADB.  2000.  Report \nand  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance \nGrant to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 1743-MON and TA3459-MON, approved \non  22  June)  supported  measures  to  expand  the  types  of  collateral  that  banks  can  accept  from  immovable  to \nmovable  property  and  financial  assets,  and  to  reduce  the  cost  of  collateral  registration.  The  Civil  Code  was \namended to allow banks to seize  immovable property  without a court decision. However, continuing ambiguity in \nthe legal framework removes a strong incentive for borrowers to meet their debt obligations. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n   \n\nthe \n\nthat  combines \n\nflexibility,  efficiency,  and \n\nimproving  quality  when  the  ability  of  downstream  buyers  to  guarantee  premium  prices  is \nuncertain. The problem is one of a classic coordination failure while all the participants in value \nchains would be better off if they acted in concert with no one willing to act first. \n \nThe Government has tried to address this problem by funding upstream improvements \n13. \nthrough  improved  input  supply,  training,  management  support,  infrastructure  development,  or \nbetter  support  services.  However,  these  investments  have  rarely  achieved  the  necessary \ncoordination  with  private  downstream  investments.  Consequently,  they  have  not  delivered \nproducts  needed  by  downstream  enterprises  or  the  markets  they  serve  and  have  failed  to \ngenerate expected benefits. Furthermore, efficiency and flexibility are imperative if value chains \nare  to  be  successful  in  today\u2019s  global,  highly  competitive  markets.  Government  programs  are \nnot  especially  well-known  for  either  of  these  qualities.  Value-chain  development  needs  an \ninformation-gathering \ninnovative  approach \nadvantages of the private sector to deliver publicly funded upstream investments for value-chain \ndevelopment in coordination with private investments in downstream improvements. \n \nChanging  attitudes  among  Mongolian  agribusinesses  offer  an  opportunity  to  try \n14. \ninnovative  approaches  to  value-chain  development.  Increasingly,  enterprises  are  realizing  that \nthey cannot grow without comprehensive value-chain development. In a small and increasingly \ncrowded domestic marketplace with increasingly quality-conscious consumers\u2500and having tried \nand failed to develop sustainable export businesses, some companies have become aware of \nthe  need  to  take  control  of  their  supply  chains  and,  particularly,  of  the  need  to  take  action \nthemselves to decisively determine the quality, quantity, and availability of their raw materials. \nProperly  supported  and  encouraged,  these  mindset  changes  will  have  a  significant  effect  on \nboth  the  quality  and  quantity  of  raw  materials  available,  and  ensure  that  basic  production  is \naligned with market needs and has significant positive rural development impacts.6 \n \n15. \nCoordinated  development  of  agriculture  value  chains  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for \nMongolia (footnote 2), which targets increased market orientation. The ADB-funded Agriculture \nSector  Development  Project7 laid  the  foundation  for  production  improvements  by  building  up \nrural infrastructure and support services, inducing changes in production methods and planning, \nand  changing  mindsets  of  producers  from  centralist  approaches  to  increased  business \nawareness. However, achievements need to be channeled toward greater market orientation by \naligning  production  with  specific  supply  chains  and  markets.  ADB  projects  have  consistently \ndemonstrated  that  agriculture  development  merely  from  supply  perspectives  does  not  allow \neffective commercialization and development. While previous development programs including \nthose under the Agriculture Sector Development Project have assisted players along the supply \nchain,  the  key  lesson  from  previous  assistance  is  that  coordination  of  this  support  along  the \nsupply  chain  is  an  essential  next  step.  ADB  projects  in  several  countries  have  demonstrated \nthat coordination along supply chains yields stronger production responses and higher benefits. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Through the process of creating their initial outline proposals (Supplementary Appendix A), a number of the private \nenterprises  engaged  during  project  preparation  have  developed  comprehensive  plans  for  integrated  value-chain \ndevelopment.  These  plans  recognize  in  concrete  terms,  and  probably  for  the  first  time  in  Mongolia,  the  need  for \ncompanies to think in a holistic manner about their business and its connections to both raw material supply and \nfinal  markets,  and  to  make  strategic  investments  throughout  the  value  chain  in  order  to  be  able  to  target  niche \nadded-value markets. As a result of this process, enterprises have developed plans to begin to resolve many of the \nproblems  of  the  supply  chain,  raw  material  quality,  reliability  and  frequency  of  supply,  and  other  problems  that \ncurrently  plague  agribusinesses.  These  plans  have  been  developed  in  combination  with  their  purely  private \ninvestment plans for upgrading production facilities, reducing costs, and improving management and marketing. \n7   ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fThe  gender  aspect  of  value-chain  development  cannot  be  neglected.  Women  and \n16. \nagribusinesses run by women play a critical role in the production of agricultural raw materials. \nSeventy  percent  of  rural  women  are  unpaid  family  workers  engaged  in  informal  micro \nproduction,  processing,  and  trading  as  well  as  household  food  manufacturers.  Furthermore, \nincreased focus on developing the untapped potential of businesses run by women will have the \ndual  benefit  of  increasing  raw  material  quality  and  the  certainty  of  supply  while  addressing \ngender aspects of rural poverty including gender income disparities. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n17. \nAlthough Mongolia\u2019s agriculture sector has received substantial assistance (Appendix 3), \nthe Project will be the first large-scale holistic approach to developing agriculture value chains \nspecifically  aimed  at  sustaining  and  delivering  premium  value  products.  More  importantly,  the \nProject  will,  in  a  break  with  traditional  models,  provide  private  enterprises  with  resources  to \nundertake  value-chain  investments  that  have  typically  been  undertaken  by  public  agencies.  A \nproblem analysis is provided in Appendix 4. \n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  sustainable  agriculture  and  rural  growth  that  maintains \npremium  value  for  Mongolian  products.  The  outcome  will  be  the  reliable  supply  of  premium \nvalue agriculture products to niche markets by selected enterprises. The outcome is expected to \nhave the desired impact beyond immediate project achievements because the Project will serve \nas a demonstration for enterprises and value-chain participants who are not immediate project \nbeneficiaries. \n \nB. \n \nThe Project will develop value chains to deliver unique premium value products to niche \n19. \nmarkets.  The  Project  will  deliver  these  outputs  through  three  components:  (i)  value-chain \ndevelopment, (ii) rural infrastructure and services development, and (iii) project management. \n \nValue-Chain  Development.  This  component  is  expected  to  make  loans  available  to \n20. \napproximately 15 private enterprises (out of a total of 23 enterprises endorsed by the advisory \nboard  established  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n[PPTA]),   to  undertake  value-chain  development  investments  that  have  high  public   goods \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n   \n\ncontent and the potential to deliver premium value products to niche markets.8 The 23 endorsed \nenterprises  prepared  outline  proposals  with  support  from  PPTA  and  endorsed  by  the  project \nadvisory  board.  These  proposals  were  presented  to  commercial  bank  credit  officers  and \nmanagement,  who  selected  those  that  they  considered  most  creditworthy.  PPTA  consultants \nworked  with  the  15  most  creditworthy  companies  to  prepare  bankable  proposals  for \nconsideration  by  commercial  banks.  The  final  decision  to  approve  loans  to  enterprises  will  be \nmade by commercial banks using their own loan appraisal methodology. Banks will make loans \nto  enterprises  using  their  own  funds.  Project  funds  will  be  used  to  make  deposits  at  each \nparticipating bank to cover 50% of the loan disbursements to project enterprises by that bank. \nDeposits are expected to range from $300,000 to $1.5 million. If a loan is declared as a loss, the \ncommercial  bank  will  be  able  to  recover  50%  of  the  principal  outstanding  from  the  deposit \naccount. Summaries of investment plans endorsed by the project advisory board are presented \nin Appendix 5. Detailed financial analyses of four representative investment plans are presented \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  Full  bankable  proposals  of  the  four  representative  enterprises \nare available as Supplementary Appendix C. The proposed supply chain investments address \nthe major constraints to value-chain development (paras. 7\u201311). The Project will promote social \nand  gender  responsiveness  of  enterprises  by  imparting  relevant  gender  awareness  and \ncapacity  development  training  for  management  and  assessing  the  performance  and  impact  of \nproject enterprises from social and gender perspectives. \n \nfund \n21. \ninvestments that will either support value chains in the longer term or have a large public good \nelement making them unattractive to private investors. Investments will build upon three priority \nareas  identified  in  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Strategy  Study:  (i)  development  of \nlivestock testing and veterinary extension centers, (ii) business advisory and technical support \nto agricultural cooperatives, and (iii) development of fodder supply and storage facilities to foster \nfodder  market  development.  The  Project  will  finance  laboratory  equipment,  civil  works,  and \ntraining  for  veterinary  centers;  training  for  water  point  establishment  and  operation;  stocking \nherds,  equipment,  and  training  for  marketing  cooperatives;  and  equipment  and  training  for \nfodder  facilities.  Selection  criteria  for  investments  and  envisioned  procedures  for  their \ndevelopment,  implementation,  and  monitoring  are  in  Appendix  6.

The project advisory board considered the following criteria when endorsing enterprises: \n(i) ownership of the enterprise is Mongolian, (ii) the enterprise is engaged in agribusiness, (iii) the enterprise has \nproducts  and/or  services  that  have  the  potential  for  premium  value,  (iv)  the  enterprise  has  been  in  operation  at \nleast  for  3  years,  (v)  the  supply  chain  of  the  enterprise  is  located  in  Mongolia  and  is  seen  to  make  a  substantial \nimpact  in  the  agriculture  sector,  (vi)  the  enterprise  has  adequate  machinery  and  equipment  to  fulfill  its  plan  or \nproposes  to  procure  the  required  machinery  as  part  of  its  plan,  (vii)  the  enterprise  has  chain  captain  status,  and \n(viii) the public good element and positive social and environmental externalities of its proposed investment plan. A \ntransparent and rigorous procedure was applied to screen enterprises and is detailed in Supplementary Appendix \nA. Enterprises were invited to apply to the Project through advertisements in national newspapers and information \nseminars in major cities. Applicants were screened on the basis of the above criteria. The information of screened \ncompanies  was  physically  checked  and  validated.  The  companies  were  then  assisted  in  preparing  investment \nproposals.  The  final  screening  of  enterprises  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the  following  criteria  applied  to  their \ninvestment proposals: (i) type of raw materials purchased, (ii) source of purchases, (iii) annual value of purchases, \n(iv) purchasing system, (v) projected turnover increase, (vi) liabilities and/or turnover, (vii) expansion of production \ncapacity,  (viii)  modernization  of  final  production,  (ix)  improved  management  and  skills,  (x)  investments  in  supply \nchains,  (xi)  improved  management  of  suppliers,  (xii)  improvements  along  supply  chains,  (xiii)  improved  raw \nmaterial  quality,  (xiv)  improved  finished  product  quality,  (xv)  development  of  new  value-added  products,  \n(xvi) development of uniquely Mongolian products, and (xvii) development of exports. The project advisory board \nendorsed  23  enterprises  as  being  eligible  to  receive  project  funds;  they  were  assisted  by  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants  in  preparing  outline  proposals.  Project  enterprises  represent  the  milk, \nmeat, herbal products, fruit products, leather, and wool and cashmere sectors. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nmembers  will  be  consulted  in  the  identification,  selection,  and  possibly  implementation  of \ncommunity-based rural infrastructure and support service development investments. \n \n22. \nProject  Management. Two project management units (PMUs) will be established: one \nat  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  for  the  value-chain  development  component  and  one  at  the \nMinistry  of  Food  and  Agriculture  (MoFA)  for  the  rural  infrastructure  and  services  development \ncomponent. Staff from PMUs, MoFA, MOF, project advisory board, and participating banks and \nenterprises  will  receive  training  (including  gender  awareness  and  capacity  development  for \nsocial and gender responsiveness) in line with the gender action plan in Appendix 7. The value-\nchain development PMU will work closely with participating banks to (i) ensure that proceeds of  \nthe  grant  are  deposited  into  deposit  accounts  in  accordance  with  respective  financing \nagreements; (ii) forecast funding requirements of the participating companies and arrange funds \nflow; (iii) monitor the use of funds against agreed plans; (iv) provide business advisory services \nand,  in  liaison  with  ADB  and  the  Government,  develop  and  assist  in  implementing  corrective \nactions  as  necessary;  (v)  monitor  performance  of  project  enterprises;  (vi)  monitor  compliance \nwith  covenants  and  environmental  and  social  performance  of  the  investments,  and  help  to \ncorrect  the  situation  as  necessary;  (vii)  organize  stakeholder  mobilization  and  gender \nawareness  workshops  including  workshops  to  facilitate  harmonization  with  relevant  ongoing \nprojects; and (viii) prepare and submit required reports for the component. \n \nImplementation  of  the  rural  infrastructure  and  services  development  component  will  be \n23. \nthe  responsibility  of  experts  from  MoFA  in  collaboration  with  aimag  (province)  agriculture \nexperts overseen by the MoFA project working group. PMU will assist MoFA by (i) assisting in \nevaluating  investment  proposals,  (ii)  forecasting  funding  requirements  for  the  component  and \narranging  funds  flow,  (iii)  monitoring  implementation  and  compliance  with  covenants,  (iv) \norganizing  stakeholder  mobilization  and  gender  awareness  workshops  including  workshops  to \nfacilitate  harmonization  with  relevant  ongoing  projects,  and  (v)  preparing  and  submitting \nrequired  reports  for  the  component.  Investments  will  be  identified  in  consultation  with \ncommunities  participating  (or  with  the  potential  to  participate)  in  supply  chains  of  enterprises \nsupported  by  the  Project.  MoFA  experts  and  project  working  group  will  coordinate  selection. \nWhere  available,  informal  herder  groups  like  those  established  under  the  Agriculture  Sector \nDevelopment Project, local community councils established under the World Bank\u2019s Sustainable \nLivelihoods  Project,  or  other  local  organizations  will  be  used  as  agents  for  local  input  into \ninvestment selection and implementation. \n \nC. \n \nBased  on  the  November  2005  debt  sustainability  analysis 9  and  revised  Asian \n24. \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grants framework, Mongolia is eligible for 100% grant financing. ADF \ngrants aim to provide development assistance to help the country tackle development issues in \nan  environment  of  debt  vulnerability;  and  assist  the  country  in  developing  the  private  sector, \ncreating  employment  opportunities,  and  achieving  sustainable  economic  growth  without \nincreasing external debt burden.

Value-chain  investments  have  public \ngoods  characteristics.  Benefits  from  these  investments  are  not  strictly  appropriable  by \ndownstream  investors.  For  example,  participants  in  the  chain  can  redirect  improved  products \nand  intermediate  inputs  resulting  from  investments  of  downstream  investors  to  buyers  other \nthan  the  investor.  Also,  many  investments  have  initial  costs  beyond  the  reach  of  small \nproducers.  Furthermore,  not  having  undertaken  such  investments  or  coordinated  actions, \nparticipants  are  not  certain  of  their  financial  benefits.  Initial  returns  are  likely  to  be  low  as \nparticipants  in  the  chain  go  through  a  period  of  learning  as  they  improve  coordination  and \nmanagement, set up delivery systems, adopt technologies, and establish information systems. \nFinally, the early period could have participants  reneging on contracts or otherwise subverting \nagreements as they go through a period of realizing the gains of long-term partnerships. Private \ninvestment  in  such  development,  therefore,  is  less  than  optimal  because  of  the  uncertainty, \nlearning, and coordination problems. Special consideration for the public goods nature of value-\nchain investments is, therefore, necessary; and a case for public support is credible. \n \n26. \nA  case  for  public  support  for  value-chain  investments  can  be  motivated  also  by  their \npositive  spillover  effects.  As  the  benefits  to  long-term  partnerships  along  supply  chains  are \ndemonstrated,  other  enterprises  and  producers  will  be  induced  into  developing  such \npartnerships  and,  thereby,  increasing  the  efficiency  of  the  sector  as  a  whole  and  incomes  of \nmore  than  the  initial  participants.  In  the  particular  case  where  supply  chains  are  developed  to \nrealize  the  potential  in  the  markets  for  premium-value  products,  positive  environmental  and \nsocial  externalities  will  be  substantial.  Enterprises  targeting  such  markets  will  have  to  ensure \nthat  their  supply  chains  adhere  to  standards  demanded  by  the  markets  and,  therefore,  will \nundertake investments with particularly high positive social and environmental impacts. Finally, \npublic  support  for  value-chain  development  through  project  enterprises  will  strengthen  the \nfinancial  system  by  increasing  the  capacity  of  commercial  banks  to  move  from  the  currently \nprevalent  collateralized  short-term  lending  to  lending  against  potential  cash  flow  and  business \nprospects. \n \n27. \nEnterprises  endorsed  by  the  project  advisory  board  have  developed  integrated \ninvestment  plans  that  include  investments  in  the  supply  chain,  improved  or  expanded \nproduction,  new  and  improved  products,  enhanced  internal  capacity,  and  improved  marketing \nactivities. The most critical elements of these plans from the point of view of the companies are \nthe  planned  investments  in  improvements  of  raw  material  quality  and  the  supply  chain.  The \nenterprises  endorsed  by  the  project  advisory  board  have  proposed  using  34.4%  of  their  total \ninvestments for capital equipment and buildings, 26.7% to improve supply chain management, \nand  38.9%  for  working  capital.  A  detailed  description  of  proposed  investments  is  provided  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n28. \nBenefits  of  the  Financial  Intermediary  Loan  Modality.  Traditional modes  of  funding \npublic  investments  are  not  suitable  for  value-chain  development.  Such  investments  through \nseparate  government-funded  programs  have  not  been  sufficiently  flexible  or  coordinated  with \nprivate investments. The financial intermediary loan modality will overcome this shortcoming by \nproviding private enterprises with funds to undertake quasi-public investments that support their \nown purely private value-chain development investment plans. This will ensure that investments \nwith substantial public goods content and high economic, social, and environmental benefits are \nfully integrated with commercial investment decisions. At the same time, due diligence applied \nby commercial banks to the value-chain development proposals will ensure that the investments \nare financially viable. Given that commercial banks will make loans to enterprises using entirely \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\ntheir  own  funds,  the  requirement  to  relend  ADB  grant  proceeds  to  a  financial  intermediary10 is \nnot  applicable.  Because  private  enterprises  will  borrow  funds  for  the  investments,  they  are \nexpected  to  ensure  that  procurement  is  undertaken  with  accepted  commercial  practices.  The \nloan  disbursement  systems  of  participating  banks  will  provide  an  established  channel  for \nfunding and collecting repayments. ADB\u2019s direct supervision of procurement and disbursement \nwill not be necessary. \n \n29. \nProvision of a Unifying Core to a Diverse Range of Initiatives. The Project will focus \nthe resources of many ongoing and planned initiatives on value-chain development. The Rural \nEconomies Development  Project  funded  by  German  development  assistance  through  German \nAgency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  provides  credit  guarantees  and  advisory  services  to \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  businesses.  Agreement  has  been  reached  with  GTZ  that  the  Rural \nEconomies  Development  Project  will  focus  resources  on  project  value  chains.  The  Market \nAccess  for  the  Poor  Project  funded  by  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD) \naims  to  increase  the  added  value  of  agriculture  products,  improve  raw  material  quality,  and \nimprove  access  to  finance.  Agreement  has  been  reached  with  IFAD  that  the  market  access \nproject will assist project enterprises with the parts of their investment plans that deal with basic \nproduction.  In  addition,  it  will  mobilize  20  grassroots  groups  integrated  in  project  value  chains \nand  support  them  in  developing  and  financing  business  plans  to  participate  in  project  supply \nchains.  IFAD  is  also  assisting  two  project  enterprises  through  a  pilot  program  to  test \narrangements for partnerships with participants in their supply chains. A joint ADB\u2013IFAD review \nof the pilot will be used to strengthen implementation arrangements for the Project at the end of \nthe second year of implementation. A component of the Sustainable Livelihood Project funded \nby the World Bank will help herder groups develop and implement pasture management plans. \nThe World Bank has agreed that the component will be pilot tested in project supply chains. If \nsuccessful, the pilots will be replicated in more project supply chains through the Project\u2019s rural \ninfrastructure and services development component. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $47.50 million including physical and \nprice contingencies and taxes and duties (Table 1).

The  Government  will  finance  $0.67  million  in \ntaxes  and  duties  and  a  portion  of  the  cost  of  management  of  the  rural  infrastructure  and \nservices  development  component.  Participating  banks  will  provide  $11.00  million  in  loans  to \nproject enterprises using their own funds. The loans are expected to have terms up to 7 years \nwith  grace  periods  up  to  3  years  during  which  interest  will  be  paid.  Commercial  banks  will \ndetermine  interest  rates  using  market-based  assessments.  The  enterprises  will  contribute \n$20.37 million of their own funds. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank ADF Grant \nGovernment \nCommercial Banks \nEnterprises \n \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n14.72 \n  1.41 \n11.00 \n20.37 \n\n47.50 \n\n% \n31.0 \n3.0 \n23.2 \n42.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n32. \nParticipating banks will lend to enterprises using entirely their own funds at rates no less \nthan  the  prevailing  ordinary  capital  resources  rate  with  market-based  spreads  on  individual \nloans reflecting the credit risk assessed by the banks themselves and their cost of funds.12 The \nflow  of  funds  under  the  Project  is  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  Every  time  a  bank \nmakes  a  disbursement  for  a  project  loan,  the  Government  will  deposit  funds  into  a  deposit \naccount at that bank in dollars and togrog to guarantee 50% each of the dollar and togrog loan \ndisbursement to the enterprises. The deposit account will always show a balance equal to 50% \nof the total outstanding principal balance on loans made by the bank to project enterprises. If a \nproject  loan  is  declared  as  a  loss  by  a  bank  in  its  reporting  to  Bank  of  Mongolia  (with  the \nendorsement of the value-chain development PMU), the deposit account balance will be debited \nby the bank by an amount equal to 50% of the loan amount declared as a loss. PMU and ADB \nwill  review  each  loan  agreement  between  the  bank  and  the  project  enterprises  to  ensure  that \nthe  cost  and  margin  structure  of  the  proposed  lending  is  fair  and  transparent.  This  rather \ncomplicated  guarantee  scheme  is  considered  efficient  given  the  present legal framework in   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12  Interest rates for deposits and loans are fully liberalized with banks free to charge interest on a risk-reward basis. \nMarket  interest  rates  are  showing  a  declining  trend  with  increasing  competition  and  gradual  decrease  in  the \ninflation rate with lending rates dropping faster than those on deposits. Lending rates have dropped from 26.6% in \n2002 to 20% in 2006 while deposit rates have dropped from around 14% in 2002 to 13.5% in 2006.

The  board  will  have  two  representatives  from \nMOF  (including  the  chairperson);  one  representative  each  from  MoFA,  the  Ministry  of  Nature \nand Environment (MNE), and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Representatives of ADB may \nattend meetings as observers. Representatives of project enterprises and civil society may be \ninvited to meetings as observers when necessary. The board will meet at least every 6 months \nto  review  progress  and  will  receive  quarterly  reports  on  implementation  of  each  of  the  two \ncomponents.  A  project  manager  will  be  appointed  as  secretary  to  the  board  and  will  be \nresponsible for implementation of the board\u2019s decisions. The project manager will report to the \nboard  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of  the  Project,  management  of  the \nproject  imprest  account,  facilitation  of  community-based  monitoring  of  the  Project,  and \ncoordination  of  activities  that  impact  across  different  components  and  with  other  projects \nundertaken by other agencies in Mongolia.  \n \n34.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the value-chain development component and for \nthe  portion of the project management component associated with value-chain development.  It \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13  The Project will provide a guarantee of up to 50% of the principal of the term loans provided by commercial banks \nto  the  enterprises.  By  making  an  interest  free  deposit  equivalent  to  50%  of  the  loan  principal,  the  Project  will \neffectively lower the commercial bank's cost of funds on the loan by 50%. The subsidy is justified on the grounds of \nthe  strong  public  goods  nature  of  the  planned  investments  by  the  enterprises.  The  subsidy  is  intended  to  help \ndevelop  term  lending  to  agribusiness  by  encouraging  commercial  banks  to  engage  in  term  lending  initially  by \nproviding  them  with  a  set  of  well-screened  potential  clients.  During  its  transition  to  a  market  economy,  ADB  has \nconsistently  supported  the  reform  and  development  of  Mongolia's  finance  sector.  The  Government  and  ADB  are \ncurrently  implementing  the  Financial  Regulation  and  Governance  Program.  Building  on  progress  achieved  under \ntwo  Financial  Sector  Program  loans,  the  Financial  Regulation  and  Governance  Program  aims  to  help  develop  a \nsound  and  broad-based  finance  sector  using  a  holistic  approach  to  address  the  remaining  legal  and  regulatory, \ninstitutional,  and  policy  constraints.  A  broad-based  financial  system  compromising  banks,  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions,  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  securities  markets,  and  the  insurance  subsector  reduces  the  risks \nassociated  with  overreliance  on  the  banking  system  and  increases  the  supply  of  long-term  capital  for  productive \ninvestment.  It  will,  in  turn,  promote  growth  and  create  jobs.  Increased  competition  from  alternative  sources  of \nfinancial intermediation will enhance efficiency, and the financial system as a whole will become more resilient to \nexogenous  shocks.  The  Financial  Regulation  and  Governance  Program's  objectives  are  to  (i)  reduce  the  cost  of \nborrowing and expand access to credit by improving the collateral framework, (ii) improve governance in banks to \nprotect  depositors,  (iii)  enhance  the  role  of  the  nonbank  financial  subsector  in  mobilizing  savings  for  investment \ncapital, and (iv) improve investor confidence by reducing risks from money laundering through the financial system. \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n   \n\nwill  sign  financing  agreements  with  participating  commercial  banks.14 MOF  will  establish  an \nindependent  PMU  to  manage  this  component.  A  full-time  PMU  director  responsible  for \nimplementation and supported by consultants will report to the project manager. PMU will work \nin collaboration with the participating banks which will appoint project coordinators from among \ntheir staff. PMU will ensure that funds received by the banks are disbursed in accordance with \nthe  financing  agreements  and  that  the  use  of  funds  by  enterprises  is  in  accordance  with  the \napproved  investment  plan.  It  will  conduct  spot  audits  to  prevent  collusion  between  banks  and \nborrowing  enterprises  and  other  misdemeanors  in  the  use  of  project  funds.  MoFA  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  rural  infrastructure  and  services  development  component  and  the \nportion  of  the  project  management  component  associated  with  the  rural  infrastructure \ncomponent.  MoFA  will  establish  a  PMU  for  the  component.  MoFA  has  established  a  working \ngroup  to  oversee  implementation  of  this  component  and  will  provide  technical  experts  from \nMoFA  to  assist  in  project  implementation. 15  A  full-time  PMU  director  responsible  for \nimplementation  of  the  component  and  supported  by  consultants  will  report  to  the  project \nmanager. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years  from  2008  to  2012.  The  value-chain \ninvestments are expected to be completed over 4 years. Participating banks will administer the \noutstanding  loans  after  project  completion.  Rural  infrastructure  and  services  development \ninvestments will be completed by year 4. An implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n36.  With  the  assistance  of  the  value-chain  development  PMU,  where  applicable,  project \nenterprises will be encouraged to follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, Section 3.12 (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time),  and  undertake  procurement  in  accordance  with  established \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  To  be  acceptable,  the \nenterprises will (i) demonstrate that procedures are appropriate in the circumstances; (ii) ensure \n\n                                                 \n14  Khan  Bank  was  selected  as  a  partner  in  the  Project  through  consultation  with  MOF  and  BOM  because  it  (i)  is \nfinancially sound, (ii) meets BOM\u2019s prudential requirements, (iii) has adequate staff for the management of project \nfunds,  (iv)  has  an  acceptable  record  of  medium-sized  corporate  lending,  and  (v)  has  at  least  20%  of  its  loan \nportfolio in rural areas. The complete due diligence report on Khan Bank is available in Supplementary Appendix E. \nOther  commercial  banks  will  be  selected  if  they  meet  the  same  criteria  and  are  considered  acceptable  to  MOF, \nBOM, and ADB; and due diligence of the bank (conducted to the same standard as that conducted on Khan Bank) \nis  considered  to  be  acceptable  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  Banking  Law,  enacted  in  1996  and  amended \nseveral times, provides the legal basis for BOM to regulate and supervise banking. About 40 staff members are in \ncharge of supervising 16 banks. BOM has made substantial progress in strengthening its regulatory capacities in \nrecent  years.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  has  been  supporting  BOM  in  establishing  and  upgrading  various \nregulations.  The  loan  classification  and  loan  loss  provisioning  standards  are  simple,  conservative,  and  well-\nimplemented. The classification criteria consist of quantitative criteria based on the duration of loans overdue and \nqualitative  criteria  based  on  the  conditions  of  borrowers.  To  minimize  discretion,  the  qualitative  criteria  are  only \nused  to  downgrade  the  classification  derived  from  the  quantitative  criteria  and  are  mainly  based  on  numerical \nindicators  such  as  return  on  assets  (net  profit  as  a  percentage  of  assets)  and  capital-asset  ratio.  The  amount  of \nloan loss provisioning is determined according to the classification under BOM guidelines (e.g., 1% for performing, \n5%  for  past  due).  The  required  provisioning  rates  for  substandard  and  doubtful  loans  were  increased  by  the \namendment of the guidelines (25%\u201340% for substandard, and 50%\u201375% for doubtful) in 2004. Commercial banks \nsubmit  loan  classification  reports  monthly  to  BOM.BOM  has  established  a  standard  set  of  prudential  ratio \nand  \nregulations \n(iv)  foreign  exchange  risk.  Banks  are  required  to  submit  reports  on  these  indicators  every  month.  A  prompt \ncorrective  action  program  was  established  to  allow  BOM  to  take  supervisory  actions  against  undercapitalized \nbanks from an order to cease paying dividends to placement of the bank in conservatorship depending on capital \ninadequacy. \n\nconcentration, \n\nadequacy, \n\nincluding \n\nliquidity, \n\ncapital \n\ncredit \n\n(iii) \n\nfor \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n15  Technical expertise is expected to be needed in civil engineering, extension, and participatory planning. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n\nthat  goods  and  services  financed  using  project  funds  are  purchased  with  consideration  to \neconomy and efficiency at a reasonable price, given time of delivery, quality, and efficiency; and \n(iii)  ensure  that  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  project  funds  are  procured  from  ADB \nmember  countries.  Enterprises  will  be  encouraged  to  procure  goods  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  and  shopping,  when  applicable,  in  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency. \nThe Government has agreed to use ADB procurement procedures with regard to economy and \nefficiency.  PMU  will  oversee  procurement  by  enterprises  to  ensure  that  ADB  guidelines  are \nfollowed. In case of noncompliance, the Government will have the right to recall the loan to the \nviolating enterprise. For all other procurement, contracts for goods estimated to cost more than \n$0.5  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $1.0  million  will  be  procured \nusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost  less  than  the  ICB  values  but  equal  to  or  more  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  standard  government  procedures \nsubject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less \nthan  $100,000  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents \nand contracts. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe  Project  will  require  436  person-months  of  consulting  services:  42  person-months \n37. \ninternational  and  394  person-months  national.  All  consultants  will  be selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Technical  experts  will  be  recruited  individually  by  the  value-chain  development  PMU  as \nrequested by project enterprises to support enterprises in the implementation of their investment \nplans. Recruitment will be through a cost-sharing arrangement whereby enterprises requesting \nexperts will bear 60% of the costs of engagement. The project manager, both project directors, \nand staff of both PMUs will be engaged individually. The remaining consultants will be recruited \nthrough  firms  under  two  packages  (one  package  each  for  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent and the rural infrastructure and services development component) following quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  procedures  using  an  80:20  quality\u2013cost  ratio.16 The  outline  terms  of \nreference are provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n38. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nExecuting  Agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate  directly  or  through  its  agents  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  The  following  national  consultants  will  be  required  for  the  value-chain  development  component:  agribusiness \nspecialist and/or project director, project monitoring specialists, financial analysts, business advisors, environment \nspecialist,  and  social  and/or  gender  specialist.  For  the  rural  infrastructure  component,  the  following  national \nconsultants  will  be  required:  project  director,  project  monitoring  specialist,  environment  specialist,  social  and/or \ngender  specialist.  The  following  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  for  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent: value-chain development advisor, and technical experts. A project manager will be recruited for overall \ncoordination. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n   \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n39. \nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate funds flow on the value-chain development \ncomponent, each participating bank will open a special account and will, with the endorsement \nof the value-chain development PMU, apply to ADB through MOF for advance deposits into the \nspecial account to cover 50% of projected disbursements to enterprises for project investment \nplans during the next 6 months. Upon receipt of this request, ADB will disburse funds in dollars \nto the special account. The participating commercial bank will make transfers from the special \naccount  to  a  deposit  account  equal  to  50%  of  every  disbursement  made  by  the  commercial \nbank to project enterprises for project investment plans. The deposits into the deposit account \nwill be in dollars and togrog\u2014 guaranteeing 50% each of the dollar and togrog disbursement to \nthe enterprise.17 The commercial banks will use procedures to liquidate transfers from the value-\nchain  development  special  account  to  the  project  deposit  account  in  accordance  with  rules \nspelled out in financing agreements between MOF and the commercial banks. The participating \ncommercial banks will release funds to MOF from the project deposit account equal to 50% of \nevery principal repayment that they receive on project loans (after deducting interest payment to \nthe  commercial  bank).18 The  commercial  bank  will  have  entered  into  a  loan  agreement  with  a \nproject enterprise (that stipulates use of funds) endorsed by ADB including terms and conditions \nrequired  by  ADB  prior  to  making  disbursements  to  the  enterprise.  Before  any  project  loan  is \ndeclared  as  a  loss,  the  value-chain  development  PMU  and  the  commercial  bank  will  make  all \nreasonable efforts to either revive the business or recover the outstanding loan amount. \n \n40. \nThe Government will establish an imprest account for the Project at a commercial bank \nacceptable to ADB to be managed by the project manager. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe account will not exceed estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the grant \namount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed between the Government and \nADB. Statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing eligible expenses \nor  liquidating  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated under SOE procedures will not exceed $50,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n41.  MOF,  MoFA,  and  participating  commercial  banks  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and \nfinancial statements for project funds in accordance with appropriate accounting standards and \nhave  these  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  use  of  special \nand imprest accounts and SOE procedures will be part of the audit, and a separate opinion will \nbe  submitted.  Enterprises  receiving  project  funds  will  be  required  to  maintain  accounts \naccording  to  international  accounting  standards  and  to  have  these  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. 19  The  audit  report  covering  the  audited  project \naccounts and financial statements for each fiscal year will be submitted to ADB in English not \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The project manager, through the advisory \nboard, will submit quarterly reports and diagnostic semiannual reports to ADB detailing project \nprogress, problems, measures taken to overcome them, and expected progress over the next 6 \nmonths as well as any major issues. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the \nproject  manager,  through  the  advisory  board,  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB \nthe \ndetailing \n                                                 \n17  The exchange  rate to be applied  when converting from dollars to togrog will be the commercial bank\u2019s reference \n\nthe  utilization  of  grant  proceeds,  project \n\nimplementation  analysis,  and \n\nbuying rate for dollars on the date of the disbursement to the project enterprise. \n\n18  Releases to MOF will be in the same currency as repayments from the project enterprises. \n19  Enterprises will adopt international accounting standards within 2 years of receiving project funding. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\nsocioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project  with  special  attention  to  poverty  reduction.  The \nGovernment  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of  audited  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  suspension  of  disbursements  of  the  ADB  grant  in \ncase of noncompliance. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n42. \nThe two PMUs overseen by the project manager will monitor project performance as part \nof  quarterly  reporting  to  the  advisory  board,  the  respective  Executing  Agency,  and  ADB \nincorporating a community-based monitoring system. Monitoring of value-chain investments will \nfollow  business  development  and  monitoring  plans  prepared  by  the  value-chain  development \nPMU with project enterprises to ensure that enterprises are utilizing project funds for intended \npurposes and that expected results are being produced. PMUs (with assistance from the social \ndevelopment specialist) will establish a (sex-disaggregated) database; carry out annual review \nand consultations on the social, gender, and participatory aspects of the Project; and ensure the \ncollection of sex-disaggregated end-line data and information. Any deviations in the use of funds \nby  enterprises  will,  if  possible,  be  resolved  in  consultation  between  PMU  and  the  enterprises. \nADB  must  endorse  major  modifications.  PMU  will  monitor  rural  infrastructure  projects  using \nstandard  reporting  and  periodic  field  visits.  Data  on  inputs  and  outcomes  of  the  rural \ninfrastructure and services development component will be organized using software developed \nby  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Project  (footnote  7).  To  identify  baseline  indicators  on \ninfrastructure availability and stakeholder needs, PMU will commission a survey and prepare an \ninventory of existing infrastructure and support service programs once an eligible locality has an \napproved  subproject  proposal.  The  survey  will  be  repeated  and  inventory  updated  at  the \nconclusion of subproject implementation. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n43.  MOF,  MoFA,  participating  commercial  banks,  and  ADB  will  review  the  Project \nsemiannually. A midterm review, not later than 2 years and 6 months after commencement, will \ninclude  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  implementation  arrangements  and  progress  as  well  as \nstakeholder  consultations.  Recommendations  will  be  made  for  adjustments  as  appropriate  to \nthe  project  scope,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation  arrangements.  Three  months  after \nproject  completion,  the  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  evaluated  according  to  a  schedule  and \nterms of reference to be agreed by MOF, MoFA, and ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n44. \nThe  accompanying  TA  for  Agricultural  Marketing  and  Brand  Development  will  be \ndirected  to  capitalizing  on  opportunities  in  niche  markets  to  develop  a  premium  brand  for \nMongolian  agriculture  products.  The  brand  development  will  be  primarily  aimed  at  developing \npartnerships  between  Mongolian  enterprises  and  external  premium  brands  to  develop  virtual \nvertically integrated value chains. The long-term objective could be to provide an opportunity for \nMongolian enterprises to develop their own indigenous consumer brands for the export market. \nA number of high-end brands (i) want to stay away from mass production price discounts, and \n(ii) would be interested in building the idea of Mongolia as a premium and/or exclusive product \nsource.  For  example,  Loro  Piana  and  Dunhill  have  been  building  up  Mongolia  as  a  premium \nsource  of  products.  Furthermore,  companies  such  as  Burberry  and  Diesel  are  known  for \ndeveloping  strong  links  with  suppliers  to  improve  their  information  technology  and  production \ncapabilities.  Enterprises  selected  for  funding  through  the  Project  have  inherent  elements  of \nperformance, process, and origin to varying degrees. The TA will build on and combine these to \nprovide a platform for creating credible and compelling brands.  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n   \n\nThe TA will contribute to realizing the impact of the Project\u2014agriculture and rural growth \n45. \nthat sustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. The outcome of the TA will \nbe  the  creation  of  a  process  for  brand  development  and  management  that  is  sustainable  and \nreplicable  while  providing  a  demonstration  effect.  The  TA  output  will  be  to  develop  and \ndemonstrate  a  process  for  collaborative  brand  development  including  a  brand  framework, \ncontent of business proposals, and an institutional framework for sustained brand management \nand development including a business plan for a brand management agency, three model brand \npartnership  agreements  between  Mongolian  enterprises  and  international  brands,  and  three \ncollaborative  brands.  Activities  will  involve  building  a  hypothetical  brand  case,  facilitating \npartnerships and enterprise selection (including internal and external surveys), designing brand \nproposals and proposal packs, making proposals, brokering partnerships and concluding deals, \ndefining the collaborative brand, creating brand collateral, conducting the brand trial, and finally, \nlaunching the brand. \n \n46. \nAppendix 11 provides the terms of reference, cost estimates, and financing plan for the \nTA. The estimated TA cost is $2.2 million equivalent. An ADB grant of $2,000,000 equivalent is \nproposed from the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill  finance  $200,000  equivalent  to  cover  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff  and  the  costs  of \nadditional  transport,  surveys,  and  documents.  Brand  development  will  be  contracted  out  to  an \ninternational  branding  firm.  Selection  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nEquipment will be procured using shopping following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. MOF will \nbe the Executing Agency. An independent PMU will implement the TA and gradually evolve into \na branding agency. The TA is expected to commence in December 2008 and be completed by \nDecember  2010.  Equipment  procured  through  the  TA  will  be  transferred  to  MOF  upon  TA \ncompletion. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n47. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Benefits.  The  Project  will  foster  sustainable  agriculture  and \nrural development. Mongolian agriculture products will claim at least a 30% price premium over \ncomparable  products  in  target  markets  by  2015  after  project  investments.  In  addition  to  direct \nbenefits, the Project has substantial demonstration benefits. The resolution of uncertainties and \ncoordination  problems  are  expected  to  induce  project  enterprises  to  expand  their  value-chain \ninvestments by at least 20% over project-funded levels within 5 years of project completion. The \nProject is expected to induce at least 25 additional enterprises to undertake similar value-chain \ninvestments within the same period. Since the premium value of Mongolian agriculture products \nderives  from  custodianship  of  the  environmental  and  social  responsibility  and,  therefore, \nprovides incentives for environmental and social responsibility, the Project will have substantial \npositive environmental and social benefits that are difficult to quantify. The economic analysis is \nin Appendix 12 and further details in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n48. \nPoverty  Reduction,  Social,  Gender,  and  Environmental  Impacts.  The  Project  will \nhave  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction.  Direct  impacts  will  come  from \nemployment  in  expanded  enterprise  operations  and  higher  rural  incomes  from  higher  value  at \nthe  basic  production  and  intermediate  supply  chain  level.  Incomes  of  agriculture  producers \nparticipating in the supply chains are expected to increase by an average of at least 60% from \n2008 to 2015. At least 2,500 families will benefit from project investments, and investments are \nexpected  to  create  at  least  800  new  jobs.  The  Government  of  Japan  has  approved  an \nassociated  Japan  Fund \n(JFPR)-funded  project,  Water  Point \nEstablishment and Extension Stations for Poor Herding Families. It will increase the access of \n\nfor  Poverty  Reduction \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\nespecially  disadvantaged  communities  to  rural  infrastructure  and  support  services,  and  give \nparticular  attention  to  the  issue  of  indigenous  groups.  A  JFPR-funded  project    for  Income \nImprovements  for  Herders  and  Intermediaries  is  being  conceptualized  for  approval  in  2009  to \nimprove the access of socially disadvantaged groups to project benefits and to mitigate negative \nimpacts on small intermediaries and indigenous groups.20 \n \n49. \nThe Project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. No land acquisition \nor  demolition  of  fixed  assets  will  be  required  for  project  implementation.  PMUs  will  monitor \ninvestments  and,  if  adverse  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  associated  with  project \ninvestments, further disbursements to the enterprise involved or the relevant rural infrastructure \ninvestment  will  be  subject  to  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995). \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  as  it  will  have  no \nadverse impact. The two JFPR projects (para. 48) are being designed to address issues related \nto  socially  disadvantaged  groups.  They  will  specifically  take  into  account  issues  of  ethnic \nminorities and ensure that they benefit from and are not adversely impacted by the Project. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n50. \nAn  environmental  assessment  is  provided  in  Appendix  14.  The  Project  is  classified  as \ncategory B in terms of environmental impacts. For the value-chain development component, the \nsample initial environmental examination (IEE) of four representative value-chain development \ninvestment  plans  was  undertaken.  If  selected,  the  enterprises  will  undergo  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  process  and  will  prepare  detailed  environmental \nassessments in accordance with MNE and ADB requirements. For the rural infrastructure and \nservices  development  component,  the  indicative  rural  infrastructure  and  support  service \ndevelopment  investments  were  reviewed;  and  the  scale  and  nature  of  activities  are  not \nexpected  to  have  any  significant  environmental  impact.  Thus,  this  project  component  is \nclassified as category C under the ADB environmental assessment criteria. MNE concurs with \nthis conclusion. Reviews of both project components conclude that the Project is not expected \nto result in significant environmental impacts warranting an environmental impact assessment. \nA summary IEE was prepared and is available as Supplementary Appendix H. The key element \nof  the  summary  is  the  EARP  for  the  value-chain  investment  plans.  EARP  was  discussed  and \nhas the agreement of MNE. \n \n51. \nThe brand image targeted by the Project will depend upon environmentally sustainable \nproduction along the supply chain. Production practices that fit into the brand image will derive a \npremium  from  protecting  the  environment  and  preserving  the  traditional  lifestyle  and  culture. \nThe Project, therefore, goes beyond safeguard measures to minimize negative impacts and is \nexpected to contribute to actively protecting the environment and cultural identity. \n \nB. \n \n52. \nin \nprocurement, delivery delays by contractors, and  misuse of funds by enterprises pose risks to \nproject outputs. These risks will be addressed by project management support. The value-chain \ndevelopment  PMU  will  provide  advisory  services  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  of  plans. \nPMU for the rural infrastructure and services development component will provide procurement \nand implementation support. Both PMUs will assist in developing contracts holding contractors \nliable  for  delivery  delays.  The  value-chain  development  PMU  will  monitor  the  use  of  funds  by \n\nInadequate  capacity  of  enterprises \n\ninvestment  plans,  delays \n\nimplement \n\nRisks \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n20  Activities may include training for herders (setting up groups or cooperatives among herders), mitigation measures \nfor smaller changers including business reorientation for them, and provision of lower interest rate loans to herders \nand changers. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n   \n\nenterprises; close monitoring by ADB and the banks will provide assurance on their use. Project \noutcomes could be at risk if enterprises cannot operate and manage expanded and upgraded \nvalue  chains.  Investment  plans  have  taken  this  into  account  and  provided  for  consultant \nsupport.  This  risk  will  be  further  mitigated  through  advisory  services  provided  by  PMU  and \nparallel  projects  implemented  by  GTZ  and  IFAD.  Some  breach  of  contracts  is  expected, \nespecially  in  the  early  stages.  However,  this  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  lending  for  working \ncapital\u2014suppliers often renege on contracts because enterprises are not able to make advance \npayments for procurement. Another risk to outcomes is the failure of participants to understand \nthe  nature  of  niche  markets  and  expectations.  Complementary  TA  will  create  internal  brand \nawareness  to  mitigate  this  risk.  Project  impacts  will  be  at  risk  if  some  enterprises  fail  to  meet \nexport  targets  and  negatively  impact  the  brand.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  project \nmanagement support and by accompanying TA to establish partnerships between international \ncompanies  and  enterprises.  These  partnerships  will  allow  enterprises  access  to  international \nexpertise  and  advice  making  it  easier  to  deliver  on  expectations.  Another  risk  is  that  some \ndomestic  enterprises  \u201cfree-ride\u201d  on  the  brand  with  bad  products.  The  long-term  mitigating \ncounterbalance to this will be the development of associations to act as custodians of the brand. \nToward this end, accompanying TA will develop partnerships with initiatives of the United States \nAgency for International Development and GTZ. Finally, adverse incentives may be provided for \nbanks  and  enterprises  to  collude  to  capture  project  funds.  However,  the  Project  is  designed \nsuch that project funds can be captured only if the banks\u2019 own funds are also captured through \ncollusion. The internal control mechanisms of Khan Bank, a participating commercial bank, are \nconsidered adequate  to  detect  such  collusion. The  mechanisms  of  any  additional participating \nbanks  will  be  checked  during  due  diligence  to  ensure  that  they  would  detect  such  collusion. \nAlso, since banks are not subject to unilateral first loss, they might subject investments to less \nthan  full  due  diligence.  The  thorough  preparation  that  investment  proposals  of  project \nenterprises  have  been  subjected  to  provides  a  degree  of  comfort  on  the  creditworthiness  of \nproposals  in  addition  to  due  diligence  by  banks.  Finally,  a  perceived  risk  is  that  having  the \ndeposit account in the same bank that makes the loans will make the account vulnerable to a \nraid  by  the  commercial  bank.  However,  this  risk  is  no  greater  than  that  for  other  deposit \naccounts in Mongolia. This risk is not considered substantial. All the potential risks from moral \nhazard  or  adverse  incentives  will  be  additionally  mitigated  by  spot  audits  performed  by  PMU. \nAny  misdemeanors  will  subject  the  involved  commercial  bank  and  borrower  to  immediate \ndisqualification from participating in the Project. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n53. \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nWithin  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  PMUs \nare  established  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  ADB,  headed  by  a  project  director, \nand staffed with competent personnel. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  project  enterprises  use  project  loan  proceeds \nfor the purpose of the investment plan endorsed by the advisory board and that \nthe recommendations of PMU in case of deviations are followed. \nThe Government will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations for counterpart \nfunds are made, approved, and released for proper project implementation. The \nGovernment will provide adequate office and other facilities necessary for timely \nand effective project implementation. \nExcept as agreed with ADB, the Government will not grant any debt amnesty, or \nforgive loan repayment obligations with respect to the project loans. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that within 2 years of the first disbursement to each \nproject  enterprise,  the  enterprise  will  produce  annual  financial  statements \ncertified  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  line  with  international \naccounting standards. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  project  activities  are  carried  out  (a)  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Mongolia, \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nIEE;  and  \n(b) in compliance with EARP. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  IEEs  prepared  for  the  four \nrepresentative enterprises is reviewed and updated in accordance with EARP at \nthe  stage  of  approval  of  the  financing  proposal  of  each  such  enterprise  and \nsubmitted to and approved by MNE prior to start of civil works or procurement. \n\nIEEs  and  summary \n\n(2002), \n\nthe \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\nthe  Government  shall \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  applicable \n\nlaws  and  regulations,  disclose \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  public  consultation  and  information  disclosure \nprocedures  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  MNE  and  ADB  requirements  for \neach \ninvestment  plan  classified  as  a  category  B  project  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy.  \nThe Government will ensure that the Project shall not cause any land acquisition, \nresettlement,  or  limits  on  access  to  land.  In  the  event  of  (a)  any  involuntary \nresettlement;  (b)  land  acquisition;  or  (c)  resettlement  activities  during  project \nimplementation, \ninform  ADB,  prepare  necessary \nresettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \nand \nthese \nresettlement plans to affected people and submit them to ADB for approval prior \nto  award  of  civil  works  contracts.  In  the  event  of  discrepancies  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s  laws  and regulations and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary Resettlement  Policy, \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy shall prevail. \nThe Government will ensure that the Project does not cause any negative impact \non indigenous people. In the event of any unanticipated or unforeseen negative \nimpact  on  indigenous  people,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nConsistent with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project \nfunds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to  implement  the  Project  and  to \nachieve the project objectives. The Government will ensure that MOF and MoFA \n(a)  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a  corruption-free \nenvironment;  (b)  ensure  that  the  Government\u2019s  Anticorruption  Law  and  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  enforced  and  are  complied  with  during  project \nimplementation,  and  that  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in bidding documents for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise of its \nright to investigate directly or through its agents any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project;  (d)  conduct  periodic \ninspections of the activities of project contractors related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements;  (e)  ensure  that  PMU  for  value-chain  development  component \nconducts  spot  audits;  and  (f)  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agencies  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe Project. The Government will cooperate with any audit and investigation and \nextend necessary assistance including access to all relevant books and records \nas well as engagement of independent auditors and experts that may be needed \nfor  satisfactory  completion  of  such  audits  and  investigations.

These  include  meat  processing,  dairy,  leather \ntannery,  leather  footwear  and  products,  fur  garments,  cashmere  processing  and  garment \nmanufacturing, camel hair processing and garment production, wool carpets and blankets, felt \nshoes  and  other  felt  products,  and  fruit  and  wild  berry  products.  As  many  agroprocessing \nenterprises collapsed with the transition to a market-based economy, current production is only \na fraction of what it was (except for cashmere). Nevertheless, livestock raw materials still form \nthe basis for almost all the textile industry and a significant proportion of the food and garment \nindustries.  Domestic  agribusiness  enterprises  face  keen  competition  from  manufacturers  from \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  with  their  surplus  capacity,  economies  of  scale,  and \nstrong government support. The PRC traders buy significant quantities of Mongolia\u2019s livestock \nproducts  (mainly  fibers  and  hides).  In  addition,  domestic  manufacturers  face  a  worsening \nsituation with respect to the quality of raw materials; this affects their processing efficiency and \nmarketing  of  end  products.  The  progressive  decline  in  the  quality  of  Mongolian  livestock  raw \nmaterial is due to the rapid buildup of numbers when quality is sacrificed for quantity resulting in \ncoarser cashmere and wool fibers, and blemished skins. These have contributed to the dramatic \ndecline in most agriculture-based industries and serious underutilization of industrial capacity. \n \nCashmere.  The  demand  for  classic  cashmere  garments  remains  high  in  the  luxury \n2. \nsegments  of  European,  American,  and  Japanese  markets  even  though  the  temporarily  higher \ndemand  for  them  created  by  fashion  designers  during  the  early  2000s  may  have  peaked. \nMongolia  is  the  second  largest  producer  of  raw  cashmere  accounting  for  25%  of  world \nproduction compared with the PRC\u2019s 70%. Mongolian production increased from an estimated \n1,000  tons  of  raw  cashmere  in  1990  to  3,000  tons  in  2000.  The  enterprises  involved  in \ncashmere  processing  and  garment  manufacturing  have  sophisticated  dehairing,  spinning, \ndyeing,  weaving,  and  knitting  equipment;  some  was  upgraded  in  recent  years.  The  industry \ncomprises  three  types  of  companies  each  with  their  own  characteristics,  markets,  and \nopportunities. First are the primary processing plants with varying degrees of foreign ownership \n(Europe,  Japan,  PRC,  Republic  of  Korea,  and  United  States).  These  joint  ventures  were \nestablished following the ban on raw cashmere exports in 1993 which was subsequently lifted in \n1996. They buy raw cashmere from herders, and scour and process it into dehaired cashmere \nfor  export  to  the  PRC  and  Europe  (as  dehaired  cashmere),  and  Japan  (as  tops).  The  second \ngroup  comprises  integrated  processors  and  garment  manufacturers  that  have  their  own  raw \nmaterial procurement network (contract buyers) and scouring, dehairing, spinning, dyeing, and \nautomated knitting and weaving manufacturing capacity. The state-owned Gobi Corporation and \nprivate  Buyan  Company  XXK  belong  to  this  group.  They  export  dehaired  cashmere  and \ngarments depending on the relative prices on international markets. The third group comprises \nlocal  and  foreign  companies  that  produce  knitted  cashmere  garments  from  hand-knitting \nmachines using imported yarn (from the PRC or Italy) for the quota-free United States market. \nThe  gross  industrial  output  from  the  manufacture  of  textiles  and  apparel  (dominated  by \ncashmere) was MNT100 billion in 2005. \n \nCarpets and Other Wool Products. Mongolia produces large quantities of coarse wool, \n3. \nsome  of  which  is  discarded  in  the  countryside  due  to  the  poor  transport  infrastructure  (high \ntransport  costs)  and  limited  demand.  Ninety-four  percent  of  Mongolia\u2019s  clip  comprises  coarse \nfibers  (suitable  only  for  carpets,  blankets,  felt  footwear,  and  insulating  products),  4%  is  semi-\ncoarse, and only 1% is fine or semi-fine and suitable for garment production. Three major carpet \n\n                                                 \n1  This appendix is based on ADB. 2004. Mongolia: Agriculture Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nproducers  and  one  blanket  producer  have  been  privatized,  two  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  one  in \nErdenet. Their combined production capacity for scouring, spinning, knitting, and felt making is \nfar  in  excess  of  current  production  (UB  Carpets  XXK  is  operating  at  60%  capacity  and  is \nanxious  to  increase  production  if  the  raw  material  is  available).  However,  the  production \ntechnology  for  carpet  manufacturing  is  outdated  and  inflexible.  Similarly,  felt  and  felt  boot \nproduction is operating at about 10% of plant capacity. \n \n4. \nMeat  and  Small  Goods.  One  of  the  challenges  for  the  slaughtering  and  meat \nprocessing industries in Mongolia, as in other countries, is the seasonality of supply\u2014although \nthis  is  more  pronounced  in  Mongolia.  From  October  to  December,  abattoirs  operate  at \nmaximum capacity, some even doing shift work to handle the seasonal flush. With little out of \nseason  production,  these  facilities  remain  inoperative  for  the  remainder  of  the  year  with  only \ntheir freezers being used to store meat and carcasses. The situation is made more complex as \nabout 70%\u201380% of animals destined for domestic consumption are slaughtered outdoors. The \nGovernment is concerned about the hygiene of meat produced in this manner and is seeking to \ndirect a greater proportion of the kill through abattoirs with established hygiene standards and \nwhere trace-back mechanisms can be introduced to monitor disease. Mongolian meat has been \nvery competitive at $0.6\u2013$0.8/kilogram of beef (2004), half the price in the PRC and one third of \nthe price in the Russian Federation. More recently, as supply shortages have become apparent \nfrom increased domestic consumption, meat prices have increased dramatically ($2.50/kilogram \nfor beef and slightly less for mutton) to the extent that the Government has chosen to introduce \nmeasures  to  stabilize  meat  prices  at  affordable  levels  for  urban  consumers.  The  industrial \noutput of food products in 2005 was MNT93 billion. \n \nFour of the 26 slaughterhouses were established in 2002 with about 25% being licensed \n5. \nas export meat works. Historically, Mongolia has been a significant exporter of mutton and beef \nbut with the current domestic demand from increased urbanization and changing consumption \npatterns associated with higher incomes, the domestic market is more attractive and quantities \nexported declined to near zero in 2005 and 2006. Russian demand declined dramatically after \ntransition  due  to  the  lower  purchasing  power  of  its  population,  and  it  imposed  a  20%  duty  on \nunprocessed meat and a 40% duty on processed meat products such as sausages and salami. \nWith the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2002, the Russian Federation and other markets \nhave been virtually closed although such action probably had little impact on the meat industry \nin view of domestic developments. \n \n6. \nDairy  Products.  The  Mongolian  population  has  traditionally  enjoyed  a  high  per  capita \nconsumption  of  milk  comparable  to  that  of  developed  countries  due  to  its  high  livestock \npopulation and traditional dietary practices. Following the collapse of the domestic dairy industry \ndue  to  hasty  privatization,  the  large  domestic  demand  for  milk  and  dairy  products  such  as \ncheese and ice cream in urban centers has been met largely from imports. Liquid milk imports \nhave  increased  five  fold  in  recent  years;  however,  due  to  the  high  price,  milk  consumption  is \nonly  half  of that  in  1990.  Domestic production of  fresh  milk  is  highly  seasonal  and  marketable \nsurpluses  are  usually  generated  for  a  short  period  of  the  year.  Milk  factories  have  substituted \nfresh supplies by reconstituting imported milk powder, some of which is coming in to Mongolia \nunder  grant  assistance.  Some  liquid  consumption  is  met  from  small  dairy  plants  using \ndomestically  produced  milk\u2014pasteurized  and  unpasteurized\u2014the  latter  being  sold  in  markets \nand on the street in unhygienic conditions and posing considerable health hazards. Small-scale \ndairy  processing  plants  produce  a  range  of  dairy  produce  including  yogurt,  cheese,  and  other \ntraditional Mongolian dairy products supplying the urban centers and rural urban populations. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nBefore 1990, the largest dairy plant operating in Ulaanbaatar produced 40 million liters of \n7. \nmilk  a  year,  supplied  mainly  by  state-owned  dairy  farms  in  the  city  outskirts  via  a  network  of \ncollection  points  and  holding  centers  along  a  sealed  road  to  the  central  northern  region.  After \nprivatization of the national cattle herd, this collection system collapsed along with the state-run \nfarms. The highly subsidized intensive dairy farms also failed without coal to keep the animals \nwarm and feed to maintain their production. The previously government-owned Suu plant is now \noperating at 1% capacity. The use of domestically produced milk by processors based on small-\nscale producers surrounding the urban centers has increased slightly and private collection and \ncooling centers have been reestablished but the proportion of total consumption remains low. \n \n8. \nLeather Products. Most Mongolian hides and skins are exported to the PRC either raw \nor as semiprocessed wet blue hides. The domestic demand for leather jackets, boots, and other \nproducts  is  now  supplied  by  imports  from  as  far  as  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Turkey  whose \nproducts  enjoy  virtually  duty-free  access  to  the  Mongolian  market.  Mongolian  hides  and  skins \nare  very  competitively  priced,  almost  half  the  price  of  those  in  the  PRC,  although  some  price \ndifferential  is  due  to  the  generally  smaller  size  of  animals  in  Mongolia,  their  lighter  skins,  and \nquality  aspects  (blemishes  from  ectoparasites).  The  PRC  traders  are  regular  visitors  to  rural \nareas where they wander at will in search of hides. Since 1990, some 48 small- and medium-\nsized  companies  have  been  established  for  mainly  primary  processing  (24)  but  also  for \nprocessing fur (4), and leather and tannery products (10). These processors face difficulties in \nprocuring  raw  materials  because  their  access  to  capital  at  reasonable  interest  rates  coincides \nwith  the  peak  buying  period  for  livestock,  and  plants  are  run  well  below  their  capacity.  For \nexample, the processing plant at Buligaar was recently upgraded with Italian machinery under a \ngovernment-to-government  loan.  The  company  has  a  large  debt  and  management  difficulties, \nand  even  closed  down  in  1997  for  4  years  but  reopened  in  2001.  It  is  still  operating  at  10% \ncapacity. \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR \n(2000\u20132007) \n \n\nAmount \n\nLoan  \n($ million) \n\n \nYears of \nImplementation \n\nFunding Source and Title \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank \n1.

Although nominal veterinary services are provided in all regions of \n2. \nMongolia,  the  extremely  high  parasitic  damage  on  animal  skins;  decreasing  quality  of  fibers \nsuch as cashmere, camel wool, and sheep wool; and regular disease outbreaks including hoof \nand mouth, anthrax, and bubonic plague clearly indicate that the current system is not effective \nin  protecting  animal  health  and  in  delivering  the  quality  raw  materials  required  by  processors. \nPlanned investments include provision of dipping baths and other rural infrastructure for removal \nof ectoparasites, regular provision of anthelmintics to reduce endoparasites, training for herders \nin  basic  veterinary  care  and  monitoring,  provision  of  basic  drugs  for  regular  administration  by \nherders,  and  regular  professional  herd  inspections  to  ensure  early  disease  detection.  All  the \ncompanies that will invest in this area are specialists with an interest in a particular species or \nparticular  raw  material.  However,  they  recognize  that  their  investment  in  improved  veterinary \nservices will have to be made over very wide geographic areas and across all species within the \narea in order to be effective. \n \n3. \nBreed  Improvement,  Breeding  Programs,  and  Introduction  of  Improved  Genetics. \nMany animal breeds in Mongolia are mixed largely as a result of repeated Soviet experiments in \ncrossbreeding  over  50  years.  Very  few  of  these  experiments  were  successful.  For  instance, \ncrossbreeding  native  Mongolian  goats  with  Russian  Don  goats  produced  more  fiber  but  at  a \nsevere  cost  of  increasing  coarseness  with  the  result  that  much  Mongolian  cashmere  has \ndifficulty being competitive internationally with a current average 16.5 micron thickness versus \nan  international  standard  of  14.5  micron.  The  same  is  true  with  many  herbal  resources;  for \ninstance,  the  Soviet  cross-breeding  of  seabuckthorn  improved  harsh  weather  tolerance \nmarginally  but  resulted  in  plants  with  lower  oil  and  nutrient  yields  and  significantly  shortened \ntheir productive life in some cases down to 15 years compared with the 25\u201330 productive years \nof the naturally occurring plant. Companies interested in investing in animal-origin raw materials \nare planning breed improvement programs to develop groups of premier breeding animals with \ncharacteristics  as close as  possible to  the  original  native  breeds.  They will  then  provide  these \nbreeding  animals  to  herders  who  will  use  them  to  breed  improved  genetics  into  the  herd  over \nseveral generations. Although the companies will benefit from their investment in being able to \nobtain better quality raw materials, the greatest good from these programs will be public as the \ncompanies  will  have  little  or  no  control  over  the  spread  of  the  improved  genetics.  Companies \ninterested  in  sustainable  exploitation  of  herbal  resources,  particularly  seabuckthorn,  recognize \nthe need to invest in improved genetics to ensure long-term sustainability of the resources and \ninternational-standard quantity and quality of oils, juices, and pulps. \n \n4. \nIncentive Payments. Companies have developed plans to provide incentives to herders \nand  farmers  for  the  delivery  of  improved  quality  raw  materials.  Agricultural  supply  chains  in \nMongolia have for many years been marked by a lack of price\u2013quality differentiation largely as a \nresult  of  aggressive  competition  for  raw  materials  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  While \nproviding  incentives  to  herders  to  deliver  improved  quality  is  an  obvious  strategy,  processing \ncompanies  already  burdened  by  high  costs  and,  with  very  short  buying  seasons  that  increase \nthe  pressure  on  working  capital,  have  been  unable  to  introduce  sustainable  programs.  In \nparticular,  without  the  other  elements  of  supply  chain  investment  noted  in  this  appendix \n(particularly veterinary service improvement  and improvement of breeding and genetics), such \nprograms would produce little or nothing in terms of higher quality but would certainly increase \nthe  cost  of  raw  material.  The  introduction  of  sustainable  incentive  programs  will  mean  that  all \nherders and other suppliers, whether in the company initial target areas or not, will be able to \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nto \n\ninvest \n\nin  ongoing \n\ntraining  programs \n\nTraining.  Companies  plan \n\nbenefit  from  making  investments  themselves  targeted  to  improve  raw  material  quality.  In \naddition  to  monetary  incentives,  the  participating  companies  all  recognize  that  the  current \ninformality  and  uncertainty  of  the  supply  chain  is  a  major  disincentive  to  herders  and  farmers \nmaking  any  independent  investments  and  improvements.  The  majority  of  companies  are, \ntherefore, committed to working with a more formal contracting structure.  \n \n5. \nfor  quality \nimprovement,  breeding,  and  horticultural  and  veterinary  care.  Many  farmers  and  herders  in \nMongolia are inexperienced largely because, until the transition, many were white-collar workers \nwho  took  to  herding  or  farming  only  when  the  economy  collapsed  and  herding  became  a \nnecessity for survival. This lack of experience, knowledge, and preparedness of many herders \nand  farmers  has  been  amply  demonstrated  in  recent  years  by  a  series  of  dzuds  (large-scale \ndeaths of livestock during a harsh winter due to lack of fodder preparation, winter shelter, etc.), \nthe  destruction  of  some  significant  natural  herbal  resources  with  continued  use  of  destructive \nharvest techniques (i.e., seabuckthorn in Durbuljin soum, Zavkhan aimag), low yields in almost \nall animal husbandry and herbal resource sectors, and the general low quality of raw materials \nin  the  supply  chain.  To  be  effective,  training  for  better  veterinary  or  horticultural  care  will,  like \nveterinary services, have to be applied widely and cover many more people than the immediate \nsuppliers  to  a  particular  company  to  ensure  that  the  current  situation  of  extreme  variability  in \nboth quality and quantity of raw material supply does not continue.  \n \n6. \nRural  Infrastructure.  Companies  plan  to  invest  in  improving  or  developing  rural \ninfrastructure.  Following  the  transition  to  a  market-based  economy,  much  of  the  rural \ninfrastructure  including  wells,  warehouses,  sorting  sheds,  slaughterhouses,  and  intermediate \nprocessing facilities were abandoned or fell into disrepair as no money was available and, more \nimportantly,  no  one  had  responsibility  for  their  upkeep.  In  responding  to  this  Project,  several \ncompanies  have  prepared  plans  to  improve  existing  rural  infrastructure  and  facilities  or  build \nnew  ones  that  will  allow  proper  storage,  preservation,  procurement,  semiprocessing,  and \ntransporting  of  their  raw  or  semiprocessed  materials  more  efficiently  and  with  less  risk  of \ndamage or loss. This focus by companies on the development of rural infrastructure will begin to \nchange the current excessive concentration on Ulaanbaatar\u2019s markets as a source of most raw \nmaterials used by processors. The current situation results from the lack of rural infrastructure \nand facilities for storage, sorting, etc. The result is that people in the countryside are very much \nat  the  mercy  of  those  with  both  money  and  transport,  overwhelmingly  the  large  city-based \n\u201cchangers.\u201d The provision of even simple facilities for sorting and grading, pressing and baling, \npreservation, frozen storage of plant resources, and others will make a huge difference to many \nrural residents who will be able to take advantage of these services (and the incentive schemes \ndescribed earlier) to improve their earnings or develop new earning streams.  \n \n7. \nCooperative  Development.  Companies  plan  to  invest  in  development  of  supply \ncooperatives;  most  companies  plan  to  promote  this  informally.  To  solve  specific  problems  in \nparticular subsectors where supply variability is particularly acute, two companies plan to invest \nin assisting the development and maintenance of supply cooperatives. The companies will fund \nset up and provision of offices and basic services such as electricity, computerization, stock and \naccounting  systems,  and  training.  When  established,  the  cooperative  will  be  contracted  to \nsupply the company against set quality and quantity criteria. At the same time, the cooperatives \nwill  be  free  to  develop  additional  income  streams  with  other  processors  using  their  excess \nproduction and the same office, technology, and techniques provided by the original company \nresponsible for the set up. In addition to these formal plans to establish cooperatives, several of \nthe other companies will encourage suppliers to organize in this way assisted by the incentive \nschemes and/or more formal contracts that they plan to introduce.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n33 \n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND  \nSUPPORT SERVICE INVESTMENTS \n \n\n1. \nInvestments. The rural infrastructure and support services development component will \nfinance  public  investments  identified  as  priorities  in  the  Agriculture  Sector  Strategy  Study  and \nthat either have positive impacts on supply chains of project enterprises or the potential to spur \nincreased efficiency of the chains. Investments will focus on three priority areas identified in the \nAgriculture Sector Strategy Study: (i) development of livestock testing and veterinary extension \ncenters,  (ii)  support  to  agricultural  producer  marketing  cooperatives,  and  (iii)  development  of \nfodder  supply  and  storage.  Local  participation  in  the  selection  of  investments  will  be  ensured \nthrough participatory procedures. Where available, the Project will make use of existing herder \ncooperatives,  local  councils,  or  other  institutions  with  local  participation  (e.g.,  nongovernment \norganizations) to ensure local stakeholder input in identifying investments. The Ministry of Food \nand Agriculture (MoFA) will lead the preparation of subprojects. \n \n2. \nSelection  Criteria.  For  interventions  financed  through  the  rural  infrastructure  and \nsupport services development component, proposal selection for financing will be based on the \nfollowing criteria: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nidentified as a priority investment in the Agriculture Sector Strategy; \nlocated  in  geographic  areas  supported  under  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent; \ndirectly  supports  the  supply  chains  developed  under  the  Project  or  has  the \npotential to positively impact the project supply chains; \nimproves quality and reliability along the supply chain or enhances value addition \nin primary agricultural production; \nprovides  benefits  to  other  stakeholders  and  the  community  as  a  whole;  able  to \naddress the needs and constraints identified by female stakeholders; \nprovides for greater delivery of public goods (e.g., improve the environment); \nhas demonstration effects for other supply chains or the community; \nprovides an economic net present value of 12% or higher based on preliminary \ncost\u2013benefit analysis of the proposed investment; and \nis  fully  compliant  with  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in case it is triggered. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n3. \nThe costs for any single investment in a locality will be targeted at $80,000 as a starting \npoint. The maximum investment for any single investment in a locality will be $200,000 without \nspecific authorization to exceed this limit from the project advisory board established to oversee \nimplementation of the project preparatory technical assistance.  \n\n \nSelection  Process.  The  location,  scale,  and  precise  type  of  infrastructure  across  the \n4. \nfour  types  defined  (paras.  2\u20133)  will  be  determined  in  consultation  with  localities  where \nagribusinesses supported by credit lines under the value-chain development component obtain \nraw  material  or  intermediate  inputs.  Detailed  proposals  will  be  demand  driven  with  subproject \ncomponents identified by stakeholders through herder and farmer cooperatives, local councils, \nand  other  existing  institutions  for  local  participation  and  representation.  The  localities  will  be \nadvised  by  technical  experts  from  MoFA.  MoFA  will  lead  the  technical  preparation  of \nsubprojects through its operating network. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nThe selection procedure for investments under rural infrastructure and support services \n\n5. \ndevelopment component will proceed as follows.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe soums or bags (lower jurisdictions) from which the agribusinesses receiving \nlines of credit under component 1 are identified.  \nUnder the coordination and supervision of a panel of experts convened by MoFA, \nstakeholders from the identified localities (i.e., farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses \nreceiving  credit  lines  under  the  value-chain  development  component,  and  other \nresidents  of  the  locality)  discuss  investment  priorities  for  the  locality  across  the \nfour broad areas targeted for investments.  \nThe  MoFA  panel  in  cooperation  with  the  concerned  locality  develops  concept \nnotes  outlining  the  infrastructure  proposed  for  development  in  the  locality.  The \nconcept  notes  are  made  available  for  review  and  comment  by  stakeholders.  At \nthe same time, designated staff in the project management unit (PMU) undertake \npreliminary  review  of  the  concept\u2019s  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB \nrequirements,  particularly  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  When \nnecessary,  due  to  the  nature  of  the  infrastructure  proposed,  environmental \nimpact  assessment  reports  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared.  Any \nproposals that appear likely to involve category A environmental impacts will be \nexcluded from further consideration. Any proposals that trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy will be subject to further actions to ensure compliance with \nthe Policy. \nUpon  clearance  of  the  infrastructure  investment  proposal  from  the  stakeholder \nand PMU review, a detailed investment proposal is developed that specifies the \nengineering, capital, operating expenses, staffing, and other requirements of the \nproposed infrastructure subproject.  \nFinal  detailed  subproject  proposals  undergo  a  final  round  of  stakeholder  review \nand  input,  and  remaining  issues  regarding  the  subproject  are  incorporated  into \nthe final design. The subproject is then cleared by MoFA steering panel.  \nFunds  are  allocated  to  begin  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed \ninvestment,  and  goods  and  services  required  to  execute  the  subproject  are \nsecured  in  accordance  with  ADB  and  government  procurement  requirements. \nImplementation of the investment will be in accordance with plans and standard \nsafeguards proceeds as per ADB standards. \n\n \n6. \nProposals will have to be demand driven. PMU at MoFA will identify aimags (provinces) \nand soums for the rural infrastructure and support services development component based on \nthe  approved  investment  proposals  and  prepare  an  information  package  for  dissemination  to \nrural communities. The information packages will include data on the overall project objectives, \nexpected outcomes, project implementation procedures and structure, selected enterprises, and \nbasics  of  bankable  proposals.  It  will  include  detailed  information  on  the  component  including \nprocedures  for  selecting  local  proposals  and  implementing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  these \nproposals. PMU will conduct training of trainers for the staff of the aimag agriculture offices to \nensure complete concurrence and standardized local implementation of the component. In turn, \naimag agriculture offices will organize training for local trainers and facilitators for consultations \nand workshops among the local communities in the bags and soums. The local trainers will be \nused  as  agents  for  ensuring  local  input  into  investment  proposal  preparation.  PMU  will \ndisseminate information packages on procedures for the selection of proposals for community-\nbased supply chain infrastructure and support services and call for local proposals. To increase \nexposure of rural communities to the benefits of the component, information dissemination will \nbe  organized  in  selected  aimags  and  soums  through  (i)  official channels  of  aimag,  soum,  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nbag  administrations;  (ii)  local  newspapers,  television,  and  radio;  and  (iii)  nongovernment \norganizations and formal and informal business networks (cooperatives and partnerships). The \nlocal rural communities will prepare investment proposal ideas with the assistance of the local \ntrainers.  Where  available,  the  World  Bank-funded  livelihood  project  councils  or  other  local \norganizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  be  responsible  for  initial  screening  and \nselection of the proposal ideas to be developed into a community-based supply chain subproject \nproposal. The series of training sessions led by the locally trained trainers and facilitators with a \nparticular focus on project proposal writing will be provided to the communities with the selected \nproposal  ideas.  The  final  subproject  proposals  will  be  submitted  to  PMU  at  MoFA  for  final \nselection and funding. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nActivities \n\nat PMUs \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\nIndicators and Targets \n\nResponsibility \n\nGeneral Activities \n\nA.  \n1.

The  procedures  to  be  followed  for  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be \nthose set forth in the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia of 1 December 2005 effective since  \n\nThe  recipient\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures  are  subject \n\nNational Competitive Bidding \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n41 \n\n1 February 2006, as amended (amendment 1 dated 6 February 2007), (hereinafter referred to \nas  the  Law)  with  the  clarifications  and  modifications  described  in  the  following  paragraphs \nrequired  for  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n\nApplicable procurement procedure. Bidding shall be conducted in accordance \nwith  the  open  bidding  procedure  as  defined  in  the  Public  Procurement  Law  of \nMongolia, chapter 2, subject to the provisions stated in para. ii (c). \n\nParticipation  in  bidding  and  preferences. (a) Government-owned enterprises \nin Mongolia shall be eligible to participate in bidding only if they can establish that \nthey are legally and financially autonomous, operate under commercial law, and \nare not a dependent agency of either the procuring entity or the project executing \nor  implementing  agency.  (b)  Prospective  bidders  shall  be  permitted  to  request \nbidding  documents  either  in  person  or  by  mail  upon  submission  of  a  written \napplication. Bidding documents shall be sold to anyone who is willing to pay the \nrequired fee for the bidding documents, and no other conditions shall be imposed \non the sale of the bidding documents. The bidding documents shall be delivered \nat  the  prospective  bidders'  preference,  either  by  hand  or  by  mail  or  courier, \nprovided  that  the  bidder  is  willing  to  pay  the  mail  or  courier  delivery  charges \nwhich  should  be  specified  in  the  bid  invitation.  Each  bidder  shall  be  allowed  to \npurchase only one set of the bidding documents for a given tender. No limitations \nshall  be  imposed  on  any  bidder  as  to  the  number  of  tenders  in  which  it  may \nparticipate during a given time period. But the bidder\u2019s qualification (financial and \ntechnical capabilities) for award of contract(s) shall be assessed on the basis of \nits  capacity  to  meet  the  aggregated  qualifying  requirements  for  the  award  of \ncontracts  for  which  it  has  submitted  the  lowest  evaluated,  substantially \nresponsive  bids.  (c)  Interested  foreign  bidders  from  eligible  countries  shall  be \nallowed  to  participate  without  being  required  to  associate  or  form  joint  ventures \nwith local bidders. Foreign bidders shall be eligible to participate in bidding under \nthe  same  conditions  as \nlocal  bidders.  Mongolian  bidders  and  goods \nmanufactured in Mongolia shall be given no preference over foreign bidders and \ngoods  manufactured  outside  Mongolia  either  in  the  bidding  process  or  in  the \nevaluation of bids. (d) Prior registration shall not be a requirement for any bidder \nto  participate  in  bidding.  (e)  Prequalification  of contractors shall  not  be  required \nexcept  in  the  case  of  large  or  complex  works  and  with  the  prior  written \nconcurrence of ADB.  \n\nAdvertising.  Invitations  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  the  Mongolian  national \nlanguage  in  at  least  one  widely  circulated  national  daily  newspaper  and  freely \naccessible, nationally known website in accordance with Article 21.1 of the Law \non Procurement. Bidding of NCB contracts estimated at (a) $500,000 or more for \ngoods  and  related  services;  and  (b)  $1,000,000  or  more  for  civil  works shall be \nadvertised concurrently with the general procurement notices on ADB\u2019s website. \n\nStandard  bidding  document. Standard bidding documents acceptable to ADB \nshall  be  used.  The  bidding  documents  shall  provide  clear  instructions  on  how \nbids should be submitted, how prices should be offered, and the place and time \nfor  submission  and  opening  of  bids.  Bidders  shall  be  allowed  to  submit  bids  by \nhand, mail, or courier. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(v) \n\nQualification  criteria  and  evaluation  criteria.  (a) Qualification criteria shall be \nclearly specified in the bidding documents, and all criteria so specified, shall be \nused  to  determine  whether  a  bidder  is  qualified.  The  evaluation  of  the  bidder\u2019s \nqualifications should be conducted separately from the technical and commercial \nevaluation  of  the  bid.  When  postqualification  is  applied,  the  assessment  of \nbidders' qualifications shall be carried out only after the preliminary and detailed \nevaluation  of  bids  has  been  completed  by  the  Executing  and/or  Implementing \nAgency and, in doing so, the qualifications of the bidder who has submitted the \nlowest  evaluated,  substantially  responsive  bid  shall  be  assessed  first.  The \nevaluation  of  a  bidder\u2019s  qualifications  shall  only  take  into  account  the  bidder\u2019s \ncapacity and resources to perform the contract, in particular, its experience and \npast  performance  on  similar  contracts;  capabilities  with  respect  to  personnel, \nequipment, and construction or manufacturing facilities; and financial position. In \ncarrying out the postqualification assessment, the Executing and/or Implementing \nAgency  shall  exercise  reasonable  judgment  in  requesting,  in  writing,  from  a \nbidder  only  missing  factual  or  historical  supporting  information  related  to  the \nbidder's  qualifications  and  shall  provide  a  reasonable  time  period  (that  is,  a \nminimum of 7 days) to the bidder to provide a response. (b) Evaluation criteria to \nbe  used  in  the  evaluation  of  bids  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding \ndocuments,  and  evaluation  criteria  other  than  price  shall  be  quantified  in \nmonetary terms. All evaluation criteria so specified shall be taken into account in \nbid evaluation. Merit points shall not be used in bid evaluation.  \n\nBid  opening,  evaluation,  and  award  of  contract. (a) Bids shall be opened in \npublic immediately upon the stipulated deadline for submission of bids. Bidders' \nrepresentatives  and  project  beneficiaries  from  the  concerned  local  community \nshall be allowed to attend. The name of the bidder and total amount of each bid \nincluding  discounts  shall  be  read  aloud  and  recorded  in  the  bid  opening  record \n(BOR). Bids received after the deadline for bid submission shall be rejected and \nreturned  to  the  bidders  unopened.  Immediately  after  completion  of  the  bid \nopening  proceedings,  a  copy  of  BOR  shall  be  posted  at  a  prominent  location, \naccessible to the public, outside the office of the concerned procuring entity, and \nshall  be  retained  at  the  same  location  until  the  award  of  contract  has  been \nnotified. A copy of BOR shall be promptly provided to all bidders who submitted \nbids.  (b)  All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  or  new  bids  invited  without  ADB's  prior \nwritten  concurrence.  (c)  No  bid  shall  be  rejected  merely  on  the  basis  of  a \ncomparison with the owner\u2019s estimated cost or budget ceiling without ADB's prior \nwritten concurrence. (d) A bid containing material deviations from or reservations \nto  the  terms,  conditions,  or  specifications  of  the  bidding  documents  shall  be \nrejected  as  not  substantially  responsive.  A  bidder  shall  not  be  permitted  to \nwithdraw  material  deviations  or  reservations  once  bids  have  been  opened. \nBidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of \nnonmaterial, minor deviations, or reservations. (e) The evaluation of bids shall be \ndone  in  strict  adherence  to  the  criteria  specified  in  the  bidding  documents,  and \ncontracts  shall  be  awarded  to  the  qualified  bidder  offering  the  lowest  evaluated \nand  substantially  responsive  bid.  (f)  Bidders  shall  be  requested  to  extend  the \nvalidity of their bids only under exceptional circumstances and, in all such cases, \nthe  Executing  and/or  Implementing  Agency  shall  obtain  ADB  approval  for  the \nextension  of  the  bid  validity  period  in  a  timely  manner,  and  subsequently, \ncommunicate  such  request  for  extension  of  the  validity  period  of  the  bids  in \nwriting to all bidders before the date of expiry of their bids. Bidders shall have the \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nright  to  refuse  to  grant  such  an  extension  of  the  validity  of  their  bids  without \nforfeiting their bid securities. Bidders agreeing to extend the validity date of their \nbids shall also extend the validity period of their bid securities. (g) In the case of \ncontracts  of  more  than  18  months\u2019  duration,  the  bidding  documents  and  the \nresultant  contract  shall  provide  for  price  adjustment  based  on  a  formula \nacceptable  to  ADB  which  shall  be  disclosed  to  the  bidders  in  the  bidding \ndocuments.  (h)  If  a  bidder  that  submitted  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  refuses  to \naccept  the  arithmetical  corrections  made  by  the  Executing  and/or  Implementing \nAgency  during  the  evaluation  of  its  bid,  its  bid  shall  be  disqualified  and  its  bid \nsecurity  shall  be  forfeited.  (i)  A  bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  for \naward,  to  undertake  obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  or \notherwise  to  modify  its  bid  as  originally  submitted.  (j)  There  shall  be  no \npostbidding negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder or any other bidder. No \nbidder shall be required, as a condition for the award of contract, to change the \nbid  price  or  otherwise  materially  alter  the  bid  after  it  has  been  submitted.  (k)  A \nbidder  declared  ineligible  by  ADB,  based  on  a  determination  by  ADB  that  the \nbidder  has  engaged  in  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  in \ncompeting for or in executing an ADB-financed contract, shall be ineligible to be \nawarded an ADB-financed contract during the period of time determined by ADB. \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nInspections of accounts and records. Bidding documents and contracts under \nNCB  procedures  financed  by  ADB  shall  include  a  provision  requiring  suppliers \nand  contractors  to  permit  ADB  to  inspect  their  accounts  and  records  relating  to \nthe  bid  submission  and  the  performance  of  the  contract  by  the  supplier  and/or \ncontractor, as the case may be, and to have them audited by auditors appointed \nby ADB, if so required by ADB. \n\n \n(viii)  Complaints by bidders and handling of complaints. Bidders\u2019 complaints shall \nbe handled in accordance with the procedures set out in the Public Procurement \nLaw of Mongolia, chapter 7. \n\nDisclosure of decisions on contract awards. At the same time that notification \non  award  of  contract  is  given  to  the  successful  bidder,  the  results  of  the  bid \nevaluation  shall  be  published  in  a  local  newspaper  or  well-known,  freely \naccessible website identifying the bid and lot numbers and providing information \non (a) name of each bidder who submitted a bid; (b) bid prices as read out at bid \nopening; (c) name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their \nrejection;  and  (d)  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  the  price  it  offered,  and  the \nduration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract  awarded.  The  procuring  entity, \nExecuting  and/or  Implementing  Agency  shall  respond  in  writing  to  unsuccessful \nbidders  who  seek  explanations  on  the  grounds  on  which  their  bids  were  not \nselected. \n\nADB  member  country  restrictions.  Bidders  must  be  nationals  of  member \ncountries  of  ADB,  and  offered  goods  and  works  must  be  produced  in  and \nsupplied from ADB member countries.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A10.4: Proposed Indicative Contract Packages  \n\nNumber \nof \nContracts \n \n \n\n \nCost Estimate \nper Contract \n \n \n\n \nAggregated Total \nCost Estimate \n \n \n\n \nMode of \nProcurement\n \n \n\nExpected Date of \nAdvertisement \n \n \n\n \nPrior \nReview\n \n \n\n \nResponsible\nAgency \n \n \n\n \n \n4\n4\n \n\n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n \n\ni\n\n20,000 \n \n \n275,000 \n83,300 \n\n42,500 \n30,000 \n\n7,500 \n50,000 \n \n \n868,000 \n\n \n\n100,000 \n \n \n275,000 \n250,000 \n\n42,500 \n30,000 \n\n7,500 \n50,000 \n \n \n868,000 \n \n\nShopping \n \n \nNCB \nShopping \n\nShopping \nShopping \n\nShopping \nShopping \n \n \nQCBS (80:20)\nSimplified \ntechnical \nproposal \n\nYesb \n \n \nYes \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \n \n \nYes \n \n\nPMU \n \nPMU \nPMU \nPMU \n\nPMU \nPMU \n\nPMU \nPMU \n \n \nPMU \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nNCB = national competitive bidding, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based system. \na  Establishment of five veterinary services centers and testing laboratories are proposed. \nb  For NCB, the first draft English language version of the procurement documents should be submitted for Asian Development Bank (ADB) review and approval \nregardless of the estimated contract amount.

The  brand \ndevelopment will be primarily aimed at developing partnerships between Mongolian enterprises \nand  external  premium  brands  to  develop  a  virtual  vertically  integrated  value  chain.  The  long-\nterm ambition could be to provide an opportunity for Mongolian enterprises to develop their own \nindigenous  consumer  brands  for  the  export  market.  A  number  of  high-end  brands  (i)  want  to \nstay  away  from  price  discounted  goods,  and  (ii)  would  be  interested  in  building  the  idea  of \nMongolia  as  a  premium  and/or  exclusive  product  source. 1 Enterprises  selected  for  funding \nthrough  the  Project  have  inherent  elements  of  performance,  process,  and  origin  to  varying \ndegrees. The TA will draw on and combine these to provide a platform for creating credible and \ncompelling brands. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe TA will contribute to realizing the impact of the Project\u2014agriculture and rural growth \nthat  sustains  premium  value  differentiation  for  Mongolian  products.  The  outcome  will  be  the \ncreation of a process for brand development and management that is sustainable and replicable \nby the institutions charged with managing that process, while providing a demonstration effect \nwith two leading enterprises and involving other enterprises in the longer-term process. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  TA  outputs  will  be  a  brand  framework,  content  of  business  proposals,  and  an \ninstitutional framework for sustained brand management and development including a business \nplan for a brand management agency. \n \nC. \n \nAn  international  branding  firm  will  be  recruited  through  a  lump-sum  contract.2 Services \n4. \nare expected to be provided by a team of two senior consultants supported by a team of up to \nfive junior consultants and researchers altogether providing approximately 40 person-months of \ninputs including 6 person-months in Mongolia. The selection of consultants will follow the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and other arrangements for the recruitment of domestic consultants acceptable to ADB. \n \n5. \n\nTerms of Reference for Consulting Services \n\nThe consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ndevelop a brand framework; \ncatalogue the supporting technical issues; \nusing  two  enterprises,  develop  guidelines  for  enterprises  preparing  for  brand \ndevelopment; \ndevelop the generic material and content for business to business proposals by \nMongolian enterprises; \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n1   For  example,  Loro  Piana  and  Dunhill  have  developing  Mongolia  as  a  premium  source  of  products.  Furthermore, \ncompanies  such  as  Burberry  and  Diesel  are  known  for  developing  strong  links  with  suppliers  to  improve  their \ninformation technology and production capabilities. \n\n2   International branding companies do not operate against personnel schedules and specified individual inputs. They \noperate as entities that commit to deliverables. Therefore a lump sum remuneration contract to provide the defined \nTA outputs for the brand development component is proposed as the contracting method for consultants. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nmake proposals for two enterprises and develop generic guidelines; \nfacilitate  partnership  agreements  and  use  these  deals  to  develop  guidelines  for \nother enterprises; \nfacilitate the implementation of the partnership agreements; \nhelp  the  external  enterprises  define  the  brand  based  upon  actual  product \ndevelopment and feed this back into the proposals developed earlier; \nprovide advice to the partners and their point agencies on the use of the brand; \nand \nassist in the launch of the product brand. \n\nThe consultants will maintain a continuous strand of collated lessons to be used to refine \n\n \n6. \nthe process for subsequent enterprises and feed it back into the generic process and proposal. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n7. \nThe estimated TA cost is $2.20 million equivalent, of which $2.00 million equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe cost estimates are in Table A11. \n \n\nTable A11: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \n\n \n\n \n  \n \n\n   \n   \n   \n\n1.

Infrastructure  is  broadly  defined  to  include  physical \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  technical  assistance  (TA),  support  service,  and  capacity  building. \nHigher growth and profits of agroenterprises will, in turn, enable primary producers (particularly \nlivestock  producers)  to  receive  higher  prices  for  their  outputs.  Through  this,  poverty  will  be \nreduced  among  rural  households  that  depend  on  agriculture  and  livestock-raising activities  for \ntheir livelihood. High agroenterprise revenues are expected to benefit the economy as a whole \nthrough increased employment and higher wages at agroenterprises.  \n \n2. \nMongolian agriculture has few comparative advantages on international markets based \non price and quality due to its geographic conditions (i.e., mostly semi-arid grasslands with short \ngrowing seasons), low economies of scale, and relatively high transport to most global markets. \nAccordingly,  a  focus  on  the  few  areas  of  comparative  advantage  (e.g.,  extensive  livestock \nproduction) and development of market niches is crucial in moving the sector forward. Building \non  areas  of  comparative  advantage  and  development  of  market  niches  require  investments  in \nupgrading  private  enterprises  engaged  in  key  agricultural  supply  chains  and  in  the  public \ninfrastructure that supports primary producers engaged in these supply chains.  \n \nThe Project will develop niche markets that provide price premiums for Mongolian agro \n3. \nexports  through  a  branding  campaign  and  initiatives  to  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of \nproducts. Credit lines to agroenterprises for value-chain development and investments in public \ninfrastructure  where  enterprises  secure  raw  materials  are  the  principal  mechanisms  for \nachieving these outcomes. Public and private capital needs to be developed to move Mongolian \nagro  industry  forward.  Investments  in  new  physical  and  institutional  infrastructure  are  an \nessential complement to the credit lines provided and the brand development efforts as enabling \npublic  infrastructure  will  create  the  conditions  that  foster  greater  production  efficiency  and \nbenefit sharing by primary agricultural and livestock producers. \n \nB. \n \nThe financial and economic analyses are based on separate indicative investments for \n4. \nthe  value-chain  development  investments  and  the  grants  for  supporting  public  infrastructure. \nEnterprises  with  indicative  investments  under  the  value-chain  development  component \n(component 1) of the Project operate in fruits and berries processing, meat processing, tannery \nand production of leather goods, and herbal medicine. The 15 enterprises targeted for support \ninclude firms producing cashmere and wool, dairy products, and vegetable processing. All these \nenterprises serve  both  national  and  export  markets.  Indicative  investments  related  to  the  rural \ninfrastructure  and  services  development  component  (component  2)  involve  three  types  of \ninvestments: (i) development of livestock testing and veterinary extension centers, (ii) support to \nagricultural  producer  (herder)  marketing  cooperatives,  and  (iii)  development  of  fodder  supply \nand storage. Detailed descriptions are available in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nBecause the precise mix and scale of investments in agroenterprises and localities will \n5. \nnot  be  determined  until  implementation,  analyses  are  carried  out  only  for  separate  indicative \ninvestments,  and  no  effort  is  made  to  try  to  sum  returns  across  proposed  components  or  to \n\nResults of Financial and Economic Analysis \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\narrive at overall internal rates of return. Furthermore, the long-term benefits of fostering greater \nvalue  addition  in  supply  chains  by  improving  the  business  environment  and  supporting \ninfrastructure for private enterprises in the agriculture sector and developing niche markets for \ntheir  products  with  price  premiums  cannot  be  quantified  with  an  adequate  degree  of  precision \nand,  hence,  are  excluded  from  the  analysis.  However,  ample  evidence  indicates  that \ninvestments will improve the quantity and quality of agroprocessed goods produced by the firms \nand  through  this,  generate  additional  wealth  for  the  economy.  In  the  case  of  the  support  to \nlocalities  to  develop  targeted  types  of  infrastructure  related  to  supply  chain  development, \nanalysis faces a similar problem in that final determination of the precise type of infrastructure to \nbe  supported  will  be  decided  based  on  the  inputs  of  local  communities  and  technical  experts. \nThese  characteristics  of  the  Project  make  assessment  of  its  economic  and  financial  returns \nindicative and problematic to aggregate across investments.  \n \n6. \nIn accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \nof  Projects  (1997),  the  representative  subproject  analysis  is  based  on  the  investment  budget \nmodel  with  breakdowns  on  revenue  and  cost  by  the  investment  inputs  and  outputs,  and \nprojected cash flows over 20 years. Prices are in 2008 constant year prices assuming an annual \ninflation  rate  of  6%  (the  approximate  historical  average  in  Mongolia  during  the  past  4  years). \nSensitivity  analysis  of  the  risk  of  a  shorter  economic  life  of  the  Project  was  completed.  All \nexpenditures,  revenues,  benefits,  and  costs  are  incremental  and  expressed  in  dollars.  The \nexchange rate applied in calculations between foreign and domestic currency relies on the mid-\n2007 exchange of MNT1,165 per $1.00. \n \n7. \n \n\nThe analytical framework relies on the following assumptions and specifications: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAll prices, benefits, and costs were adjusted to early 2008 constant values using \nthe gross domestic product deflator for all local currency benefits and costs, and \nthe G-5 manufacturer\u2019s unit value index for all foreign exchange.  \nA discount rate of 12% was used to calculate the net present value and was used \nas a cutoff point for the economic internal rate of return. \nProject benefits and costs used in the financial analysis were adjusted to prices \nused  in  the  economic  analysis  by  deducting  taxes  and  duties  and  by  applying \nitem-specific  conversion  factors  (i.e.,  for  items  whose  economic  value  differed \nfrom  observed  market  values  as  in  the  case  of  public  goods  or  goods  with \nassociated  positive  or  negative  externalities  or  nontraded  goods)  to  local \ncurrency costs. All prices are valued in early 2008 constant prices.  \n\nAn \n\nis  applied \n\nincremental  benefit  analysis  approach \n\n \n8. \nto  demonstrate  potential \nimprovements  in  the  performance  of  farming  and  herding  households  and  other  major \nparticipants  in  the  agricultural  value  chain  by  determining  whether  (i)  transactions  costs  are \nreduced  in  terms  of  lowered  losses  due  to  decline  of  product  quality  during  processing  and \nshipment,  transport  costs  and  delivery  time  required,  and  marketing  costs  associated  with \nmovement  of  goods  from  the  primary  producer  to  final  consumer;  and/or  (ii)  revenues, \nemployment  opportunities,  value  addition  in  product  processing,  and  total  production  are \nincreased  due  to  the  Project.  Quantifiable  benefits  under  the  agroenterprise  credit  line \n(component 1) are likely to accrue from the subprojects financed by the rural infrastructure and \nservices  development  component  (component  2)  of  the  Project,  as  well  as  benefits  based  on \nthe  credit  line  alone.

Agriculture accounted for 20% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP),  40%  of  employment,  14%  of  export  earnings,  and  25%  of  GDP  growth  in  2007.  Livestock \nproduction,  which  accounts  for  80%  of  agricultural  output,  is  an  important  source  of  income,  jobs,  food  security,  and \nsavings  for  rural  households.  The  country  had  40  million  head  of  livestock  in  2007,  and  the  number  continues  to \nincrease with the higher domestic demand for meat and other products of animal origin and increasing demand for raw \nmaterials from the People\u2019s Republic of China. But productivity is low and production risky. Little value is added with less \nthan  10%  of  production  processed  beyond  the  most  basic  stage.  The  country  mostly  exports  raw  fibers  and  animal \ncarcasses. Growth has come mostly from higher livestock numbers and brought associated problems of desertification, \npollution, and breed dilution. The results are a stagnant rural economy, low and uncertain rural incomes, and threats to \nthe environment. Market orientation, efficiency, and sustainability of agriculture and rural development are objectives of \nthe  country  strategy  and  program.a  Coordinated  development  of  agriculture  value  chains  is  in  line  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) strategy for Mongolia. ADB's strategy targets increased market orientation. The ADB-funded \nAgriculture  Sector  Development  Projectb  has  laid  the  foundation  for  production  improvements  by  building  up  rural \ninfrastructure  and  support  services,  inducing  changes  in  production  methods  and  planning,  and  changing  mindsets  of \nproducers from centralist approaches to increased business awareness. However, achievements need to be channeled \ntoward greater market orientation by aligning production with specific supply chains and markets. \n \nB. \n \n1.  \nLow  agriculture  growth  will  put  overall  growth  at  risk.  Low  and  unstable  agricultural  incomes  and  limited  rural  income \nopportunities  are  a  cause  of  poverty  and  vulnerability.  Agriculture  accounts  for  a  fifth  of  GDP.  Agricultural  and \nagroprocessed exports account for about a fourth of foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture is the source of employment \nfor almost half of the labor force and the most important source of household income in rural areas. The rural population \ncomprises  43%  of  Mongolia\u2019s  2.5  million  population.  In  2003,  rural  poverty  was  estimated  to  be  43%.  The  natural \ncalamities  of  2000\u20132001  demonstrate  the  vulnerability  of  the  livelihoods  of  poor  herder  households  to  natural  shocks. \nVulnerability also manifests in the form of noticeable seasonal consumption variations that reflect agricultural production \ncycles.  Agriculture  and  rural  development,  therefore,  is  crucial  in  broadening  and  sustaining  growth  and  providing \nopportunities for the poor who have not yet benefited from the transition to a market-based economy. \n \nTwo  main  groups  were  identified  based  on  assets  and  vulnerability:  herders  and  changers;  more  than  40%  are  poor. \nHerd  size  is  the  major  distinguishing  factor  between  the  three  groups  of  herders.  The  bulk  of  households  with  100  or \nfewer  head  of  livestock  are  poor.  Those  in  the  second  group,  considered  middle  class,  own  100  to  500.  Those  in  the \nthird,  wealthy  herder  households,  have  more  than  500  livestock.  The  first  consists  of  families  that  were  in  poverty \nfollowing  the  transition  and  moved  to  herding  because  of  lack  of  alternative  income  opportunities.  Most  were  rural \nnonfarm  agricultural  workers  or  industrial  or  periurban  workers.  They  rear  small  herds  on  common  areas  near  urban \nareas, and their stationary herd management is a major source of land degradation. The poor herders do not have basic \ninfrastructure for herding (i.e., fences, winter shelters, wells), their children tend to drop out from school, and they live in \nextended  families.  The  second  group  has  more  herding  experience  but  is  vulnerable  to  bad  weather  and  changes  in \ndemand. They do not have basic infrastructure for herding (i.e.,  winter shelters,  wells), transportation to move around, \nand equipment for hay making. The third group has access to winter shelters and owns wells and fences; their problems \nare related to limited pasture for herding and limited access to low interest lending. The bulk of agricultural raw materials \nproducers  have  small  herds  and  have  difficulty  establishing  stable  trading  relations  with  changers  and  processors. \nCollaborative  arrangements  between  these  herders  could  substantially  improve  their  income.  For  all  these  groups, \nimproved  marketing  and  distribution,  improved  access  to  market  information,  and  availability  of  risk-sharing \narrangements  would  provide  important  income-increasing  advantages.  The  changers  are  grouped  into  small,  medium, \nand  wealthy  changers.  The  small  changers  are  those  with  a  subsistence  income,  without  a  source  for  running  a \nbusiness or space for storing cashmere. The medium changers have enough income for living and small savings. They \nbuy cashmere using two sources: (i) their own savings, and (ii) money from wealthy changers. Few of them have their \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13       51   \n\n \n\nown  facility  to  store  cashmere.  Wealthy  changers  have  their  own  funding  to  buy  cashmere,  their  own  storage,  and \naccess to bank loans. The major portion of the small and medium changers is made up of single women with children. \nThe Project identifies a third special group of families as poor. They originated from workers families of the former state \nfarms  and  engaged  in  crop  production:  wheat,  potatoes,  or  other  vegetables.  This  group  is  specific  to  aimags  of  the \nKhangai  region.  Many  of  those  families  have  only  subsistence  production  on  small  amounts  of  land  and  few  cows  for \nmilking.  Although  they  have  more  diversified  income  sources,  they  still  face  many  constraints  such  as  limited  pasture, \nlack of equipment for hay making, and inability to compete with imported crops. Additional income opportunities may be \ncreated for them as some project proposals are targeted with investment to create berry bush plantations in that region. \nEnterprise  selection  should  pay  careful  attention  to  proposals  of  enterprises  for  developing  local  basic  agriculture  raw \nmaterial  processing  (A  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  [JFPR]  project  is  envisaged  with  a  view  to  supplement  the \nProject  by  addressing  some  of  the  problems  of  poor  herders  and  changers.  Activities  may  include  training  for  herders \n(setting  up  groups  or  cooperatives  among  herders),  mitigation  measures  for  smaller  changers  including  business \nreorientation, and provision of lower interest rate loans to herders and changers. \n \n2.  \nDuring  project  implementation,  a  participatory  approach  will  be  adopted  to  enable  different  stakeholders  to  be \nrepresented at the project steering committee and other project structures. To increase the exposure  of the rural  poor \nand vulnerable groups such as  women and remote herders to the benefits of the Project, special care  will be given to \nenhance  their  participation  through  intense  dissemination  activities  and  a  focused  awareness  campaign  by  the  project \nmanagement units (PMUs). \n\nDesign Features \n\nII.  \nFindings of Social Analysis  \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. \n \nThe Project is categorized as category C for involuntary resettlement. It will not require any land acquisition or demolition \nof  fixed  assets  for  its  implementation.  PMUs  will  monitor  investments  and,  if  adverse  involuntary  resettlement  impacts \nare  associated  with  project  investments,  further  disbursements  to  the  enterprise  involved  or  the  relevant  rural \ninfrastructure investment will be subject to compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The Project is \ncategorized  as  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples  impact.  It  will  have  no  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples.  The \nJFPR  project  is  being  designed  to  address  issues  related  to  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  will  specifically  take  into \naccount  issues  of  ethnic  minorities  and  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  benefit  from  the  Project,  and  will  not  have  any \nadverse impact on them. \nB. \n \nA participatory process was adopted during project design to understand the needs and constraints of stakeholders. Five \nstakeholder groups were identified and consulted during project preparation. Primary stakeholders include herders and \nchangers;  secondary  stakeholders  include  staff  from  the  local  governor\u2019s  office,  representatives  of  nongovernment \norganizations,  and  local  residents.  Consultation  consisted  of  an  extensive  participatory  rural  appraisal  conducted  in \nBayankhongor,  Hovd,  Selenge,  and  Sukhbaatar  aimags.  During  each  of  the  field  trips,  participatory  workshops  were \norganized to identify stakeholders\u2019 interests, understand linkages between the major project participants, and develop a \nparticipation strategy during project preparation and implementation. \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\nGender and Development \n\n \nWas a C&P plan prepared? \nNo C&P plan was prepared; PMU will develop it with assistance from the social and gender specialist consultant during \nthe first year. \nC. \n \n1.  Key Issues \nWomen  entrepreneurs  are  involved  in  micro  agricultural  processing,  and  preparation  and  trading  of  agricultural  raw \nmaterials.  Women  experience  higher  rates  of  poverty  and  unemployment  in  rural  areas,  and  persistent  gender  wage \ngaps. Their business is usually of an informal nature. Women comprise nearly half of the economically active population, \n54% of those in informal sector, 70% of service providers, 69% of retail traders, and 62% of food manufacturers; and yet \n70% are referred to as unpaid family workers. Only 1/3 of entrepreneurs are female, and the share increases as the size \nof the enterprise decreases. In addition, they are involved in household production which contributed 47% of household \nincome in 2006 (compared to 36.8% in 2003). In cashmere, the only industry studied from a gender perspective, women \nparticipate  on  a  par  with  men  but  men  dominate  in  sales.  Therefore,  rural  women  constitute  a  critical  target  for  any \nsustainable  intervention  aimed  at  strengthening  and/or  developing  viable  supply  chains  and  markets.  Promoting \nwomen\u2019s  entrepreneurship  will  contribute  to  improving  raw  material  quality  and  certainty  of  supply,  and  reduce  rural \npoverty, in particular gender income disparities. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n2.  Key Actions  \nMeasures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use of relevant \nservices, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n \n\nThe  strategy  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  within  the  design  and  implementation  of  the \nProject  will  adopt  a  dual  approach  outlined  in  the  project-specific  gender  action  plan.  This  will  involve  (i)  encouraging \nagricultural enterprises to adopt socially and gender-responsive policies, strategies, and programs; and reflect them in \nthe  value-chain  development;  and  (ii)  facilitating  informed  participation  of  women  and  women\u2019s  groups  in  the \nidentification,  selection,  and  implementation  of  rural  infrastructure  and  support  services  development  projects.  One \ninternational  and  two  full-time  national  social  development  consultants  with  demonstrated  experience  in  gender  and \ndevelopment  and  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  will  be  engaged  under  the  Project.  They  will  work  directly  with \nPMUs  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Food  and  Agriculture.  The  Project  will  establish  and  maintain  a  sex-\ndisaggregated database and promote annual consultations with relevant stakeholders and local communities to monitor \nits social, gender, participatory, and related impacts. \n\nIII. SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nNo land acquisition or demolition of fixed \nassets is expected due to implementation \nof the Project. The Project will not likely \nrequire any resettlement. \n\nThe Project is not likely to have any \nadverse or significant impact on indigenous \npeople. Associated JFPR projects are \nbeing proposed to increase the access of \nespecially disadvantaged communities to \nproject benefits and mitigate negative \nimpacts on indigenous groups. \nThe Project is expected to increase \nemployment opportunities. All enterprises \nwill be required to comply with national \nlabor legislation. \n\nChain captains working directly with the \nherders will result in downsizing of \nchangers, especially smaller ones. \nFurthermore, the investment proposals \ntend to work with the herders who have \ncapacity to supply substantial volume of \nraw material resulting in exclusion of poor \nand mid-size herders from the project \nactivities. JFPR projects should be \ndesigned to implement mitigation plans for \nthese groups. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/\nLimited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nNo Impact \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nLimited \n\nLimited \n\nLabor \n\n Employment \n      opportunities \n\n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nAffordability \n\nLimited \n\n \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers \n\n \n\n \n\nIV.

Due \nto the potentially extensive and varied scope of the Project, the assessment was not carried out \non  a  specific  site  but  rather  on  the  type  of  intervention,  potential  impacts,  and  broad \ncorresponding mitigation measures. At the time of preparation of the IEE, the individual supply \nchain  investment  subprojects  and  rural  infrastructure  investments  of  the  Project  had  not  been \nselected.  Individual  sample  IEEs  of  representative  value-chain  investment  plans  likely  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  were  prepared.  The  summary  IEE  and  four  IEEs  of  representative \nsubprojects are included as Supplementary Appendix H.   \n \n2. \noverall Project is categorized as B and the rural investments of the second component as C. \n \nA. \n\nFor  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  environmental  assessment  purposes,  the \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n3. \nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  value-chain  development,  (ii)  rural  infrastructure \nand  services  development,  and  (iii)  project  management.  Environmental  assessment  was \ncarried out for the first two components. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Value-Chain Development  \n\n4. \nThis  component  will  develop  value  chains  to  deliver  premium  value  products  to  niche \nmarkets.  A  competitive  process  was  established  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) to select bankable proposals. Through the credit line, funding is expected to be \nprovided to 15 selected agroindustrial enterprises at the top of the supply chain in the wool and \ncashmere,  leather,  meat,  and  fruit  and  herb  industries.  The  selected  enterprises  will  use  the \ninvestment to carry out a range of activities that will strengthen the quality and reliability of the \nsupply  of  inputs  to  their  operations and  improve  their  own  production processes.  Examples  of \nthe  bankable  proposals  of  four  representative  enterprises  are  presented  in  Appendix  5  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  The  requests  for  external  financing  range  from  $1.45  million  to \n$1.71  million  per  enterprise.  The  enterprises  featured  in  Appendix  5  and  Supplementary \nAppendix C record an annual turnover of $1.5 million\u2013$2.0 million and employ between 70 and \n200  people.  Based  on  the  proposals  of  these  enterprises,  possible  project  activities  include \ninvesting in improved technology processing equipment to produce higher value, purer extracts \nof  seabuckthorn;  investing  in  improved  genetics;  training  and  increasing  sources  of  supply  of \nseabuckthorn;  expanding  and  developing  an  existing  meat  processing  and  canning  facility; \nproviding  training  for  herders  and  farmers  in  improved  husbandry,  quality  standards,  and \nveterinary  care;  investing  in  new  or  upgraded  production  facilities  for  leather  processing; \nproviding  veterinary  services  to  herders;  and  improving  processing  technology  for  an  existing \nherbal medicine business based on the highly valued Mongolian indigenous herbs. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Rural Infrastructure and Services Development \n\n \n5. \nRural infrastructure and services development investments will support the value chains \nof  the  agroenterprises  selected  under  component  1,  and  build  upon  investment  priorities \nidentified  in  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Strategy  Study.  Infrastructure  investments  will \nbe targeted to four priority areas identified in the Agriculture Sector Strategy Study and by the \nMinistry  of  Food  and  Agriculture  (MoFA)  as  being  underserved  in  current  government  and \ninternational  aid-financed  programs:  (i)  development  of  livestock  testing  and  veterinary \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nextension  centers,  (ii)  establishment  of  new  wells  and  accompanying  water  management \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  support  to  agricultural  producer  (herder)  marketing  cooperatives,  and  (iv) \ndevelopment  of  fodder  supply  and  storage  facilities  to  foster  fodder  market  development.  The \nscope  and  nature  of  the  indicative  investments  are  based  on  similar  investments  undertaken \nunder  the  ADB-supported  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program.  Actual  selection  of  the \ninvestments will be coordinated and supervised by MoFA agriculture and livestock experts and \nthe project working group. Where available, informal herder groups like those established under \nthe  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program,  local  community  councils  established  under  the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Sustainable Livelihoods Project, or other local organizations and nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  used  as  agents \ninvestment  selection  and \nimplementation. \n\ninput \n\nlocal \n\ninto \n\nfor \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nB. \n \n6. \nPhysical Resources. Mongolia\u2019s elevated continental position in northern Asia between \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation gives it a climate of warm summers \nand extremely cold winters. Altitude ranges from 518 meters to 4,374 meters. Rainfall is low at \nabout  200  millimeters  per  year  in  the  capital  and  less  in  the  south  of  the  country,  and  falls \nmainly  in  summer.  The  country  is  subject  to  drought,  strong  winds,  dust  storms,  and  severe \nwinters.  \n \n7. \nSoils  of  the  grasslands  are  fragile  with  overgrazing  and  cultivation  of  unsuitable  land \nleading to extensive land degradation due mainly to wind erosion of the valuable topsoil when \nthe protective vegetation cover is reduced. This causes desertification as well as dust and sand \nstorms. Mongolia is well endowed with minerals which are the country\u2019s main export.  \n \n8. \nThe failure of many wells in grazing areas has led to the reduction in the area available \nfor grazing and intensification of grazing with consequent increased land degradation on many \nareas  with  a  water  supply.  The  Tuul  River  at  Ulaanbaatar  is  heavily  polluted  by  existing \nindustries  and  urban  wastewater  with  inadequate  treatment  in  industrial  wastewater  treatment \nplants  and  the  city  central  wastewater  treatment  plant.  The  leather  processing  industry  is \nidentified as a problem because of the discharge of waste chromium used in tanning processes.  \n \n9. \nEcological  Resources.  The  country  is  on  an  elevated  plateau  mainly  of  undulating \ngrasslands  with  some  forests  and  mountains.  The  grasslands  are  extensively  grazed  by \ndomestic animals where water is available. Mongolia has a wide variety of wildlife species, and \nfishes are abundant in rivers and lakes. The country has more than 10 million hectares of forest \nor about 7% of the country area; this is currently subject to over-exploitation and fire damage. \nMore than 20 million hectares or over 13% of the country are in protected areas. \n \nC. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n10. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  result  in  an  overall  increase  in  efficiency,  productivity,  and \nprofitability  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  raise  the  economic  return  in  the  sector  through \nimproved  quality  and  access  to  markets.  Environmental  and  health  benefits  will  accrue  from \nimproving  practices  and  equipment,  including  reduced  waste,  and  moving  to  safer  usage  of \nchemicals and other inputs. In addition, the technical assistance (TA) will be provided to create \npremium  value  differentiation  of  agriculture  products.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be  brand \nawareness  among  key  stakeholders  through  a  brand  development  initiative.  The  TA  will  first \nidentify a premium brand image for Mongolian agriculture and, on the basis of this brand image, \nprovide expert advice to agricultural enterprises and participants in value chains on investments \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14       55   \n\n \n\nto  realize  the  premium  value.  Brand  development  will  provide  a  market  incentive  for  the \nagricultural industry to progress to a more sustainable basis. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Value-Chain Development \n\n11. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  supply  chains  in  four  subsectors:  leather,  wool  and \ncashmere, meat, and fruits and herbs. Bankable proposals were prepared for four subprojects; \nthese are the most advanced in their planning and most likely to be funded under the Project. \nEnvironmental  assessments  were  completed  for  these  as  representative  proposals.  Individual \nIEE  reports  are  attached  to  the  summary  IEE  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  They  include \ndetailed  tables  identifying  potential  environmental  impacts  for  each  subproject  activity,  and \nrequired  mitigation  and  enhancement  measures.  The  four  proposals  are  Mongol  Shevro \n(leather), Khatan Suikh Impex (meat), Monos Pharma (pharmaceutical factory and plantation), \nand Uvs Khuns (seabuckthorn plantation and processing). A summary of the specific potential \nenvironmental impacts based on the four IEEs follows. \n \nLeather  Subsector.  The  leather  factory  has  existing  pollution  issues  relating  to \n12. \nwastewater  containing  chromium  and  other  contaminants.  Increased  pollution  as  a  result  of \nincreased production is partially offset in the proposal by equipment upgrades to reduce water \nand chemical use per unit of production. Mitigation measures are proposed to reduce pollution \nby  at  least  the  same  amount  as  the  additional  pollution  caused  by  the  increased  production. \nThis  is  to  be  achieved  by  requiring  a  specialist  cleaner  production  assessment  as  part  of  the \ndetailed design and equipment selection. The supply chain activities may encourage herders to \nincrease  their  herd  size,  thus,  adding  to  the  existing  unsustainable  pasture  use  and  land \ndegradation. As a mitigation measure for this, the training and awareness-raising proposed by \nthe company to undertake with herders will include awareness of the benefits of maintaining a \nsmaller healthier herd and improving returns by focusing on quality, not quantity. \n \n13.  Meat  Subsector.  No  significant  negative  impact  is  identified  as  a  result  of  increased \nproduction as the process is relatively benign producing little solid waste and wastewater which \nis  disposed  of  to  the  sewerage  system  after  pretreatment  to  reduce  fat  and  oil  content.  The \nnumber of livestock around the aimag centers will increase with corresponding land degradation \nand  waste  issues.  However,  this  will  be  more  than  offset  by  the  benefits  of  reduced  livestock \nnumbers in the Ulaanbaatar area. \n \n14. \nPharmaceutical  Subsector. The proposed factory is expected to have  little significant \nenvironmental  impact.  This  is  due  to  the  location  of  the  plant  in  an  area  adjacent  to  existing \nindustry  with  no  vegetation  or  habitat  conservation  issues,  the  relatively  small  scale  of  the \noperation,  and  the  low  amount  of  waste  produced.  The  plant  will  be  a  small  modern  facility \ndesigned and operated to a high degree of cleanliness required by good manufacturing practice \nstandards.  This  will  be  complemented  by  consultancy  and  training  for  establishing  good \nmanagement  practices  and  quality  management  systems  in  accordance  with  World  Health \nOrganization standards. The impact of the proposed plantation cannot be fully assessed at this \nstage  as  the  sites  have  not  been  selected.  However,  an  analysis  is  presented  of  the  typical \nimpacts  to  be  expected  together  with  exclusion  criteria  for  site  selection  to  ensure  that \nenvironmentally sensitive areas are avoided and suitable mitigation measures incorporated. Site \nselection and development should follow these criteria and mitigation measures.  \n \nSeabuckthorn Plantation and Processing. The proposed factory upgrade is expected \n15. \nto have little significant environmental impact. The plant will be a small modern facility designed \nand operated to the high standard of cleanliness required for the target market. The impact of \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nthe proposed plantation area is expected to be low as (i) this was the site of a former irrigation \narea with water supply infrastructure already in place, (ii) water use will be a small proportion of \nthe  available  resource,  (iii)  the  area  has  little  existing  vegetation,  (iv)  no  environmentally \nsensitive areas will be affected, (v) the site is well drained, (vi) no chemicals are to be used, and \n(vii)  little  waste  will  be  produced.  With  the  incorporation  of  mitigation  measures  based  on \ngeneral  good  practice,  no  significant  or  unacceptable  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated. \nFor all subprojects under this component, Government approval is required through the Ministry \nof  Nature  and  Environment  (MNE)  before  the  project  proceeds.  Khan  Bank  will  ensure  that \nrequired  approvals  are  in  place  before  issuing  the  loan.  The  environment  specialist  within  the \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  actions  and  mitigation \nmeasures  are  implemented,  review  the  process  to  ensure  that  government  processes  have \noperated correctly, and monitor project performance throughout implementation.  \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Rural Infrastructure and Services Development \n\n16. \nThe  environmental  assessment  of  this  component  is  based  on  a  review  of  similar \ninfrastructure investments carried out under the Agriculture Sector Development Program and a \nreview  of  potential  sites  for  project  investments.  The  scale  and  nature  of  activities  in  the  rural \ninfrastructure and services development component are such that no significant environmental \nimpact  is  expected;  this  component  is  categorized  as  C  under  the  ADB  environmental \nassessment criteria. \n\n17. \nDuring  project  implementation,  PMU  environment  specialist  will  review  the  selected \ninvestments  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  differ  significantly  from  those  anticipated  during  the \nproject  preparatory  TA  in  terms  of  type,  scale,  and  environmental  sensitivity  of  location.  In \naddition, PMU will be guided by an exclusion list that states that project activities not be located \nin environmentally sensitive locations including protected areas or their buffer zones; or cultural \nheritage sites, wetlands, sensitive habitats, or areas with significant biodiversity. The Project will \nnot  fund  (i)  major  civil  works  including  major  earthworks,  dams,  irrigation  or  drainage  works;  \n(ii)  major  land  clearance;  (iii)  activities  producing  significant  liquid,  gaseous,  or  solid  wastes;  \n(iv)  activities  involving  displacement  or  relocation  of  people  or  effects  on  livelihoods,  influx  of \nworkers,  intensification  of  land  use  with  significant  environmental  degradation,  roads,  or \nsignificant heavy vehicle traffic, forestry or extractive industry (quarries); or (v) any activities that \nwould warrant classification as category A or B under ADB environmental requirements.  \n\nThe summary of impacts and mitigation measures proposed is as follows: \n\nDevelop livestock testing and veterinary extension centers. The program will \nhave a generally positive benefit in improving the health of livestock and quality \nof animal products. Improved animal health will result in improved resource use \nefficiency in terms of the amount of land, feed, and other inputs required per unit \nof  product  with  corresponding  reduction  in  land  degradation.  Improving  the \nquality  of  skins  and  fibers  will  result  in  reduced  wastage  due  to  damaged \nmaterials. Some potential for minor impacts is associated with disposal of waste. \nAs  a  safeguard  measure,  training  will  be  provided  on  safe  handling  of  supplies \nand waste disposal. Veterinary laboratories will be required to have a specialist \nincinerator meeting international standards for veterinary medical waste. \n \nSupport  herder  marketing  cooperatives.  Due largely to their small scale and \nspread  over  the  project  areas,  none  of  these  investments  is  expected  to  have \nany significant negative environmental impact. A positive benefit will be improved \n\n18. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14       57   \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nability of herders to add value and improve the quality of their produce, improve \ntheir  linkage  to  the  market,  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  production.  By \nincreasing the return to herders per animal, these activities will reduce the need \nfor  herders  to  simply  maximize  their  herd  size,  thus,  contributing  to  improved \nsustainability.  It  will  provide  support  to  herders  located  in  more  remote  parts  of \nthe  country  reducing  the  incentive  for  a  larger  number  of  animals  to  be  located \nnear  the  main  centers,  and  reducing  this  current  source  of  land  degradation  in \nthese  areas.  Waste  from  veterinary  supplies  will  be  returned  to  the  aimag \nveterinary  center,  if  possible,  for  disposal  in  a  purpose  built  incinerator  in \ncoordination with the veterinary centers subcomponent. \n\nDevelop  fodder  supply  and  storage  facilities  to  foster  fodder  market \ndevelopment.  Given  the  scale  and  nature  of  these  activities,  no  significant \nnegative  environmental  impact  is  expected.  Fodder  production  will  reduce \npressure  on  grazing  land  by  providing  secure  feed  for  winter  and  spring  when \nfeed  is  most  scarce.  Construction  activity  is  budgeted  at  $92,000  which,  when \nspread across the project areas, will only be for minor building works from which \nno significant environmental impacts are expected. Cultivation, if any, should be \non  a  small  scale  but  still  may  result  in  soil  erosion.  As  a  safeguard  for  this, \ncultivation will be planned on land with soil of low erosion potential, and employ \nsoil  conservation  techniques  including  minimum  tillage  cultivation  techniques. \nSites  selected  for  cultivation  will  be  flat  with  established  wind  breaks  against \nprevailing winds; they will not be located adjacent to waterways. These aspects \nwill  be  included  in  a  training  program  together  with  safe  use  of  fertilizers; \nherbicides; and pesticides, if these are used. \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nAs  the  selection  of  individual  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  components  1  and  2  is \n19. \nnot  yet  finalized,  appropriate  procedures  and  capacity  must  be  in  place  to  ensure  that  ADB \nenvironmental requirements are met during implementation. \n \nThe  institutional  and  monitoring  arrangements  for  the  environmental  aspects  will  be \n20. \nintegrated  with  that  for  implementation  of  the  entire  Project.  A  separate  PMU  is  to  be \nestablished  for  each  of  the  value-chain  development  and  rural  infrastructure  and  services \ndevelopment  components  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MoFA.  A  national  environment \nspecialist  will  be  appointed  to  PMUs  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  environmental \nrequirements as part of project monitoring and evaluation. Additional local specialists should be \ninvolved  in  developing  training  and  extension  programs  such  as  in  sustainable  pasture \nmanagement, industrial pollution control, and cleaner production. An international environment \nspecialist  could  be  involved  for  a  few  weeks  per  year  to  provide  guidance  in  establishing  the \nProject and conducting regular reviews. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Value-Chain Development \n\n21. \nThe  following  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  for  environmental \nassessment  and  approval  of  subprojects  under  the  value-chain  development  component  is \nbased on MNE procedures and ADB guidelines: \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB \n\nThe advisory board selects investment proposals. \nSelected  companies  are  advised  of  the  process  including  the  requirement  to \ncomply with government and ADB requirements. \nPMU  environment  specialist  categorizes  the  selected  proposals  according  to \nADB  environmental  requirements  and  provides  recommendations  to  ADB  for \ndecision: (a) category A activities will not be funded, (b) category B activities will \nrequire  environmental  assessment \n(IEE)  and \ngovernment  requirements,  and  (c)  category  C  activities  will  require  no  further \nenvironmental  assessment  under  ADB  requirements  (but  may  still  require \nassessment under government requirements).  \nCompanies  refer  their  proposals  to  MNE  for  initial  assessment  in  parallel  with \npreparing  a  detailed  proposal.  The  MNE  process  is  as  follows:  (a)  An  MNE \nexpert carries out initial assessment and makes a recommendation to the MNE \ncommittee to be completed within 12 days. (b) The MNE committee determines \nwhether (1) no further assessment is needed but may impose conditions, or (2) \ndetailed  environmental  assessment  is  needed.  (c)  If  detailed  environmental \nassessment is needed, then the company arranges for this to be carried out by a \nconsultant  licensed  for  this.  (d)  MNE  reviews  the  detailed  environmental \nassessment  and  may  request  further  information.  (e)  MNE  approves  with  or \nwithout conditions, or rejects. \nPMU environment specialist refers the subproject to ADB for review and approval \nat \nrecommendations:  \n(a) categorization according to ADB environmental requirements, (b) MNE initial \nassessment, (c) detailed environmental assessment, and (d) MNE approval. \nThe commercial bank confirms that approvals are in place and that PMU has no \nobjection before granting the loan. \n\nfollowing \n\ntogether \n\npoints \n\nwith \n\nthe \n\nDuring \n\nimplementation,  companies  should  monitor  and  regularly  report  on \n\n \n22. \nthe \nimplementation of environmental requirements and outcomes as part of the overall reporting to \nKhan  Bank  and  ADB.  The  companies  will  be  required  to  report  any  environmental  incidents, \naccidents,  complaints,  litigation,  regulatory  notices,  or  fines  in  their  operation  to  PMU,  Khan \nBank,  and  MNE  as  soon  as  possible.  Corrective  actions  will  be  developed  and  agreed  upon \nbetween  the  company  and  State  Specialized  Inspection  Agency  or  other  applicable  agency. \nThis will be referred to PMU environment specialist and Khan Bank for review and concurrence. \nKhan  Bank  will  report  any  environmental  incidents  that  it  becomes  aware  of  to  PMU  and  a \nsimilar  procedure  initiated.  The  environment  specialist  within  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing and reviewing this monitoring to ensure that it is satisfactorily carried out. \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Rural Infrastructure and Services Development \n\nThese  investments  are  confirmed  as  category  C;  therefore  no  formal  procedure  of \n23. \napproval  is  needed.  However,  the  environment  specialist  within  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing  and  reviewing  the  component  to  ensure  that  it  is  satisfactorily  carried  out  with  no \nsignificant deviations from the original scope and nature of investments, and that the exclusion \nlist is respected. \n \nE. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n24.  Major  project-related  documents  have  been  accessible  through  the  website  of  ADB\u2019s \nMongolia  Resident  Mission  in  both  English  and  Mongolian  through  out  the  project preparatory \nTA.  Numerous  consultations  were  held  with  industry,  government  officials,  nongovernment \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14       59   \n\n \n\norganizations,  herders,  traders,  suppliers,  and  others.  For  the  IEE,  meetings  were  held  with \nMoFA,  MNE,  State  Specialized  Inspection  Agency,  Khan  Bank,  World  Bank  Sustainable \nLivelihoods Project, Mongolian Cleaner Production and Energy Efficiency Center, University of \nMongolia  tannery  research  project,  and  representative  enterprises  in  each  major  subsector  to \nbe  supported  by  the  Project.  Local  (soum)  officials  and  community  groups  were  consulted  in \ngroup  meetings  in  the  field.  All  parties  consulted  are  in  favor  of  the  Project.  In  terms  of \nenvironmental  impacts,  the  main  concerns  raised  are  on  the  need  for  sustainable  pasture \nmanagement and a sustainable harvesting system, and for upgrading equipment and processes \nused  in  the  leather  industry.  One  of  the  potential  areas  of  investment,  the  seabuckthorn \ninvestment proposal, was seen to be in a position to bring positive environmental change as it  \ncan be used to control or reduce soil erosion. \n\nConclusion \n\nF. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  have  overall  environmental  benefits  and  no  major  negative  impacts.  A \nfull  environmental  impact  assessment  under  ADB  guidelines  is  not  required.  Notwithstanding, \ntwo issues associated with existing problems of industrial pollution and land degradation require \nparticular attention; appropriate mitigating measures have been designed. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 August 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "togrog (MNT) \n", "MNT1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0008673 \n", "= \n=  MNT1,152.95 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADF \nBOM \nEARP \nGDP \nGTZ \n", "IEE \nIFAD \nJFPR \nMNE \nMOF \nMoFA \nPMU \nPRC \nPPTA \nSOE \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nBank of Mongolia \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure \ngross domestic product \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u0171r Technicshe Zusammenarbeit \n(German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Fund for Agriculture Development \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nMinistry of Nature and Environment \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Food and Agriculture \nproject management unit \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nstatement of expenditure \ntechnical assistance \n", " \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n", "Vice-President \n \nDirector General \n \nCountry Director \n \n \n \nTeam leader \n \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
