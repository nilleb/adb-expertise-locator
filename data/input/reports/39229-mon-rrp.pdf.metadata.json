The Project will deliver these \noutputs  through  three  components:  (i)  value-chain  development \nunder which it will establish a deposit account to guarantee 50% of \nthe total amount of loans made by private commercial banks to \nagribusiness enterprises for value-chain development investment \nplans (selected by the bank from among a group of prequalified \nplans  with  high  public  goods  elements),  (ii)  a  local  grant  and \ninfrastructure development facility to develop rural infrastructure \nand  services,  and  (iii)  project  management.  In  a  break  with \ntraditional approaches, the Project will provide private enterprises \nwith  resources  to  undertake  value-chain  investments  that  have \ntypically been undertaken by public agencies. \n   \nRationale  Agribusiness development is essential for developing agriculture \nand  improving  rural  incomes  in  Mongolia.  While  Mongolian \nagribusiness  enterprises  have  little  quality-  or  price-based \ncomparative advantage in international markets, they do have a \ncomparative  advantage  derived  from  the  distinctive  qualities  of \nMongolian  agricultural  products.  This  provides  the  basis  for \ndeveloping  a  brand  that  could  command  a  premium  in  niche \nmarkets.  However,  realizing  niche  market  potential  will  require \ncomprehensive coordinated value-chain development. The Project \nwill achieve this development by providing private enterprises with \nthe  resources  to  undertake  investments  in  the  value  chain \ncoordinated with investments in their own processing facilities. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be agriculture and rural growth that \nsustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. The \nproject outcome is expected to be a reliable supply of premium \nvalue Mongolian agriculture products to selected niche markets. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $47.50 million \nincluding taxes and duties of $6.88 million.  \n \n   \n \n ", "ii   \nFinancing Plan   \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)    % \nADB ADF Grant  14.72    31.0 \nGovernment    1.41    3.0 \nCommercial Banks  11.00    23.2 \nEnterprises  20.37    42.8 \n    Total  47.50    100.0 \n      ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund.   \n  Source: ADB estimates. \n \nGrant Amount and  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  grant  of \nTerms  $14,720,000 from its Special Funds resources. The grant will be \nsubject to conditions set forth in the draft Grant Agreement. Grant \nfinancing  for  the  Project  is  justified  on  country  considerations. \nBased  on  debt  sustainability  analysis  and  the  revised  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grants framework, Mongolia is eligible \nfor 100% of grant financing during 2007\u25002008. ADF grants aim to \nprovide  development  assistance  to  help  the  country  tackle \ndevelopment issues in an environment of debt vulnerability and \nassist  the  country  in  developing  the  private  sector  creating \nemployment  opportunities  and  achieving  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  without  increasing  external  debt  burdens.  Grant \neffectiveness  will  be  assessed  within  the  broader  context  of \nprogram and project performance. The design of this Project and \nits  monitoring  framework  has  clear  indicators  to  measure  the \ninputs, activities, and outputs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Food and Agriculture \n(MoFA) \n   \nImplementation  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the value-chain development \nArrangements  component. An independent project management unit (PMU) will \nbe established for this component. Participating commercial banks \nin collaboration with PMU will administer project loans. MoFA will \nbe the Executing Agency for the rural infrastructure and services \ndevelopment  component.  A  PMU  for  this  component  will  be \nestablished  at  MoFA.  Overall  project  coordination  will  be  the \nresponsibility of a project manager reporting to a project advisory \nboard. \n   \nProcurement  With the assistance of the value-chain development PMU, where \napplicable, project enterprises will be encouraged to follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nSection  3.12,  and  adopt  appropriate  procurement  procedures. \nProject enterprises will be encouraged to procure goods through \ncompetitive  bidding  and  shopping  when  such  procedures  are \napplicable in the interest of economy and efficiency. For all other \n ", "  iii\nprocurement, contracts for goods estimated to cost more than $0.5 \nmillion and contracts for works estimated to cost more than $1.0 \nmillion  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost \nless than the ICB values but equal to or more than $100,000 will be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance  with  standard  government  procedures  subject  to \nmodifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  using \nshopping procedures. Relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all \nprocurement documents and contracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 436 person-months of consulting services: \n42 person-months international and 394 person-months national. \nAll consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Technical experts will be recruited individually \nby  the  value-chain  development  PMU  as  requested  by  project \nenterprises to support enterprises in the implementation of their \ninvestment  plans.  Recruitment  will  be  through  a  cost-sharing \narrangement whereby enterprises requesting experts will bear 60% \nof the costs of engagement. The project manager, both project \ndirectors, and staff of both PMUs will be engaged individually. The \nremaining consultants will be recruited through firms under two \npackages  (one  package  each  for  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent and the rural infrastructure and services development \ncomponent) following quality- and cost-based selection procedures \nusing an 80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  foster  sustainable  agriculture  and  rural \nBeneficiaries  development in Mongolia. Mongolian agriculture products will claim \nat least a 30% price premium over comparable products in target \nmarkets by 2015 after project investments. Incomes of agriculture \nproducers  participating  in  the  supply  chains  supported  by  the \nProject will increase by an average of at least 60% from 2008 to \n2015. At least 2,500 families are expected to benefit from project \ninvestments,  and  investments  by  enterprises  are  expected  to \ncreate at least 800 new jobs. In addition to its direct benefits, the \nProject has substantial demonstration benefits. The resolution of \nuncertainties  and  coordination  problems  is  expected  to  induce \nproject enterprises to expand their value-chain investments by at \nleast 20% over their project-funded levels within 5 years of project \ncompletion. The Project is expected to induce at least 25 more \nenterprises  to  undertake  similar  value-chain  development \ninvestments within the same time period. Since the premium value \nof Mongolian agriculture products derives from custodianship of the \nenvironment  and  social  responsibility  and,  therefore,  provides \neconomic  incentives  for  environmental  and  social  responsibility, \nthe Project is expected to have substantial positive environmental \nand social benefits that are difficult to quantify. \n \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  Risks to achieving project outputs arise from inadequate capacity \nof the enterprises to implement their investment plans, delays in \nprocurement  processes,  delivery  delays  by  contractors,  and \nmisuse  of  funds  by  enterprises.  These  risks  will  be  addressed \nthrough project management support. Project outcomes could be \nat  risk  due  to  inadequate  capacity  of  enterprises  and  farmers, \ncontract  enforcement  issues,  and  inadequate  awareness  of  the \nnature of niche market demand. These risks have been addressed \nthrough careful selection of enterprises, business advisory support \nthrough PMUs, and complementary technical assistance (TA) for \nAgricultural  Marketing  and  Brand  Development.  At  the  highest \nimpact level, risks arise from negative impacts of failures of a few \nenterprises on the reputation of Mongolian businesses and \u201cfree-\nriding\u201d  by  low-quality  enterprises.  These  risks  are  addressed \nthrough  the  brand  development  activities  contained  in  the \naccompanying  TA  and  project  management  support.  Adverse \nincentives for banks and enterprises to collude to capture project \nfunds have been mitigated by providing for thorough assessment \nof  internal  control  mechanisms  of  participating  banks  and  spot \naudits by PMU. The risk that banks subject investments to less \nthan  full  due  diligence  has  been  mitigated  through  thorough \npreparation  of  investment  proposals  of  project  enterprises  in \naddition to due diligence by banks. The perceived risk that having \nthe deposit account in the same bank that makes the loans will \nmake the account vulnerable to a raid by the commercial bank is \nnot considered substantial. All the potential risks from moral hazard \nor adverse incentives will be additionally mitigated by spot audits \nperformed by PMU. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  associated  TA  of  $2,000,000  equivalent,  proposed  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  for  Agricultural  Marketing  and  Brand \nDevelopment  will  be  directed  to  capitalizing  on  opportunities  in \nniche  markets  to  develop  a  premium  brand  for  Mongolian \nagriculture  products.  The  brand  development  will  be  primarily \naimed at developing partnerships between Mongolian enterprises \nand  external  premium  brands  to  develop  a  virtual  vertically \nintegrated value chain. The long-term objective is to provide an \nopportunity  for  Mongolian  enterprises  to  develop  their  own \nindigenous brands for the export market. The TA will contribute to \nrealizing the impact of the Project\u2014agriculture and rural growth \nthat sustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. \nThe outcome of the TA will be the creation of a process for brand \ndevelopment and management that is sustainable and replicable \nby  the  institutions  charged  with  managing  that  process  while \nproviding a demonstration effect with two leading enterprises and \ninvolving other enterprises in the longer-term institutional process. \nTA  outputs  will  be  a  brand  framework,  content  of  business \nproposals,  and  an  institutional  framework  for  sustained  brand \nmanagement  and  development  including  a  business  plan  for  a \nbrand management agency. \n \n ", " \n \nv\n \n   ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to Mongolia for the Agriculture and Rural Development Project, and (ii) proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Agricultural Marketing and Brand Development. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The agriculture sector is important to growth and poverty reduction in Mongolia. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)-funded agriculture sector strategy 1 contains a detailed sector \nanalysis. In 2007, agriculture accounted for 20% of gross domestic product (GDP); 40% of \nemployment; 14% of export earnings; and 25% of GDP growth. But productivity is low and \nproduction risky with less than 10% of production processed beyond the most basic stage. \nGrowth,  mostly  from  higher  livestock  numbers,  has  brought  problems  of  desertification, \npollution, and breed dilution. The result is a stagnant rural economy, poverty, and threats to the \nenvironment.  Market  orientation,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment are objectives of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2006\u20132008.2 Agriculture \nemploys almost half the labor force and is the most important source of income in rural areas \nwhere 43% of the 2.5 million population live. In 2003, rural poverty was estimated at 43%. In \naddition to being chronically poor, the rural poor are vulnerable to income shocks. For example, \nduring 2000\u20132001, severe weather killed large numbers of livestock and impoverished many \nherders. Rural incomes are tied to agriculture production patterns, and consumption varies \nnoticeably with production cycles. Agriculture and rural development, therefore, is crucial to \nbroadening and sustaining Mongolia\u2019s growth, and providing opportunities for the many poor \nwho have not benefited from recent growth. \n \n3.  Agribusiness  value  chains  are  a  crucial  lever  of  rural  development  and  income \nimprovement in Mongolia. A range of industries uses agricultural raw materials\u2014meat, dairy, \nleather,  cashmere,  camel  hair  processing  and  garments,  wool  carpets  and  blankets,  felt \nproducts, and fruit and wild berry products. However, current production (except for cashmere) \nis a fraction of what it was before the transition to a market economy. Enterprises face keen \ncompetition from manufacturers from the People\u2019s Republic of China with surplus capacity, \neconomies of scale, and government support. Domestic manufacturers confront worsening raw \nmaterial quality (caused by supply chain deficiencies) that affects processing efficiency and the \nquality of end products. An overview of agribusiness is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Opportunities in Niche Markets \n \n4.  Delivery of premium products to niche markets by Mongolian enterprises can induce \nsustained agricultural and rural growth. Without the development of such a niche, Mongolian \nagriculture will struggle in increasingly competitive international markets with severe negative \nenvironmental and social implications. Mongolian agriculture has little comparative advantage in \ncompeting on quality and cost alone. But the sector can capitalize on the same challenging \nqualities that suppress comparative advantage to develop a unique brand to create premium \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Mongolia: Agriculture Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2005. Mongolia: Country Strategy and Program 2006\u25002008. Manila. \n ", " 2 \nvalue. While Mongolia\u2019s traditional production practices, harsh and fragile environment, and \nunique geography restrict the potential for mass, standardized, low-cost production methods, \nthese qualities offer an opportunity for differentiation for brands that are seeking to differentiate \nand grow as consumers increasingly demonstrate willingness to pay a premium for quality high-\nperformance products that are authentically, ethically, and ecologically produced. Capitalizing \non these opportunities, luxury brands are increasingly working with producers to boost brand \nperceptions and grow. For example, the multibrand RED campaign and the partnership between \nKnorr (Unilever) and Phu Quoc fish sauce have successfully targeted sophisticated consumers. \nSimilarly, Mongolian enterprises can lend characteristics to established premium brand products \nto create powerful themes that can boost brand perceptions and sales. \n \n5.  Performance, process, origin, and shared ideology can create niche premium value for \nMongolian products. The strength, resilience, and potency of raw materials (e.g., the superior \nwarmth and softness of Mongolian cashmere, the concentrated nutrients of its wild berries) \nprovide a strong platform for performance-based value. The unique farming culture and lifestyle \n(e.g., hand-combed cashmere, pasture-reared meat, hand-picked berries) provide the basis for \nprocess-based value. Origins in the unique, mysterious, and remote steppes and forests provide \nthe basis for origin-based premium. Finally, consumers are willing to pay more to become a part \nof something bigger than only consumption\u2014Mongolian products permit consumers to assume \nsome of the unique spiritual and cultural qualities of the producers and feel that they are \ncontributing to some common good or a better world remote from their urban industrial lifestyles. \nThe performance, process, and origin of Mongolian products can be developed and combined \nto create credible and compelling brands with substantial price premiums.3 For example, a \nMongolian  wool  carpet  uses  durable  natural  fibers,  employs  sustainable  processes,  and \noriginates in a unique environment. Mongolian cashmere recognized for performance, process, \nand origin could command a greater premium when imbued with a distinct ideology. \n \n6.  The Government has targeted this opportunity in its Ecologically Clean Product Program \nto promote the production and marketing of natural and agricultural products. External partners \nhave attempted to realize this potential through programs for specific products. The Government \nof Switzerland assisted in developing the Camel Act brand for camel milk products. The United \nStates Agency for International Development has worked to develop brand identity around the \nFibremark cashmere label. These initiatives have targeted success, but none has achieved a \nsectorwide impact. Realizing opportunities to create successful premium brands for agriculture \nproducts will require a two-pronged approach to (i) address value-chain constraints to delivering \nthe quality and reliability expected by international markets, and (ii) increase the access of \nMongolian enterprises to premium markets through brand development. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  The most highly rewarded differentiation built on superior performance from a unique process, origin, and ideology \ncan command premiums of 20% or more over generic products. For instance, organic produce that is grown to \nstrict environmental standards without chemical pesticides or artificial fertilizers and processed without additives \ntypically costs 10%\u201340% more than similar conventionally produced products. Surveys undertaken during project \npreparation indicate that about 40% of consumers are ready to pay a 10% premium for origin-guaranteed products. \nColumbian coffee has successfully benefited from creating more than a geographic indicator, and its brand has \nsold two and a half times more than its category average at a 60% price premium. The consequences for \ncooperative members, in terms of income, have been remarkable. Success stories from products leveraging- \nshared ideology include Wala, the producer of Dr. Hauschka holistic skin care products, which is now a multimillion \ndollar business with thousands of hectares of farmland all over the world providing raw ingredients for the products \nin an environmentally responsible manner and supporting local communities in an economically sustainable way. \nWith fair trade growing in Britain by 40% per year, brands that are consistent with its philosophy are well placed to \ncapture niches within saturated categories and maintain a good premium. \n ", "  3     \n2.  Constraints to Meeting Niche Market Opportunities \n \n7.  Efforts to bring Mongolian products to international markets have stumbled because \norders were not met on time or shipments rejected due to quality shortfalls. For example, while \nthe United States Agency for International Development cashmere program had some success \nin  connecting  Mongolian  producers  to  international  markets,  several  program  participants \nstruggled to meet quality and reliability requirements along their value chain including those for \nthe most basic production and had difficulty in meeting and maintaining buyer standards. The \nchallenges lie in basic production, quality along supply chains, and final production. \n \n8.  Basic Production. Improving productivity, quality, and reliable availability of primary \nagricultural products is difficult. Partly the result of the harsh climate, production problems are \nalso linked to management, land fertility, production techniques, availability and affordability of \nquality  inputs,  plant  health,  pest  and  disease  issues,  and  application  of  appropriate \ntechnologies.  For  example,  while  local  animals  are  well  adapted  to  deal  with  the  natural \npastures and the severe climate, significant energy is needed to keep animals warm during \nwinter. With only average quality of feed from natural pastures, growth rates are slow without \nsupplementary feeding; and animals are more vulnerable to parasites and infectious diseases. \n \n9.  Quality  and  Reliability  along  Supply  Chains. Most agricultural supply chains are \npoorly organized and equipped with inadequate market information and weak linkages leading \nto uncertainties in quantity, quality, and timing of supply. When the previously centralized supply \nchain infrastructure collapsed, many enterprises ceased operation leaving gaps and inadequate \ninformation flows. Since then, gaps have been filled largely by hundreds of small or one-person \nbusinesses (locally known as \u201cchangers\u201d) trading a range of goods and agricultural materials. \nThe huge number of people and businesses, the scatter of producers and traders over large \nareas, a general lack of awareness of the needs of final markets, and the lack of appropriate \nequipment along the chain have affected the quality of raw materials reaching processors.4 \n \n10.  Insufficient working capital constrains improvements along supply chains. The ability to \nprovide funding to regular suppliers when they need it most or in times of emergency helps to \nbuild relationships. Traders from the People\u2019s Republic of China often tour supplying areas with \ncash at the time of festivals when producers need cash to purchase traditional gifts. In turn, they \ngain a right to procure raw materials at fixed prices. Cash-strapped Mongolian agribusinesses \ncannot  compete  with  this  liquidity  and,  therefore,  fail  to  build  relationships  with  suppliers. \nFurthermore, enterprises have to rely on cash flow to make purchases and cannot always \nguarantee that they will pay premiums  for  quality.   Without  guaranteed  funding  for  delivering  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  The impact of poorly organized and equipped supply chains on the quality of inputs used by chain captain \nprocessors can be dramatic. For example, while about up to 50% of the total area of skins purchased by leather \nprocessors each year is damaged in some way and, therefore, not usable for the production of high-quality \nproducts, trade sources estimate that up to 50% of the damage occurred not while the animal was alive but in the \nsupply chain through a variety of poor practices and arrangements. \n ", " 4 \nhigh-quality  raw  materials,  producers  often do  not take  actions to  improve the  quality of raw \nmaterials. All these factors affect reliability and quality along the supply chains.5 \n \n11.  Final Production. Mongolian agribusinesses face four key challenges in meeting the \nstandards  required  to  develop  sustainable,  higher,  added-value  export  businesses:  \n(i) processing technology, (ii) costs, (iii) management capacity and systems, and (iv) customer \nservice. Many enterprises are operating with outdated or inappropriate equipment from the \n1970s and 1980s (when Mongolia received significant assistance from Eastern Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union). Output quality and reliability cannot meet international market standards, \nproduction efficiencies are low, energy and other running costs high, and environmental impacts \n(i.e., water use) above international standards. Costs are also high because of low raw material \nquality,  significant  waste,  and  high  cost  of  finance.  Most  companies  have  rudimentary \nmanagement systems or lack capacity to effectively manage systems. Strongly allied to the \nproblems of improving management capacity is the lack of customer service understanding and \nethos among the management of major agroprocessors. Some observers cite this as a critical \nreason why Mongolia has largely failed to develop sustainable large-scale export businesses \neven for relatively low added-value products. International buyers experimenting with buying in \nthe country have been deterred by these cultural and attitudinal differences. \n \n3.  Value-Chain Development to Meet Niche Market Needs \n \n12.  These  constraints  cannot  be  addressed  individually.  They  must  be  analyzed  and \naddressed  as  a  comprehensive  value-chain  development  challenge  with  coordinated \nimprovements in basic production, supply chains, and final production. While enterprises have \nmade piecemeal improvements to their production systems in recent years, continuing problems \nof  low  quality  and  unfocused  basic  production  and  problems  in  the  supply  chains  have \nprevented them from stepping up production to optimal levels. Almost 80% of the 50 plus \nagribusiness enterprises surveyed during project preparation said that investing in upgrades in \nprocessing capabilities would be useless without improvements in raw material quality and \nimproved certainty of supply. Without these investments, agribusinesses cannot secure long-\nterm contracts and so, cannot pay premium prices to upstream producers and intermediaries for \nassured  supplies  of  quality  raw  materials.  Without  assurances  of  price  premiums  from \ndownstream enterprises, upstream participants in value chains do not invest in improving quality \nand reliability. Almost 90% of surveyed herders and primary producers reported that they would \nrather leave quality issues to downstream buyers and accept lower premiums than invest in \n                                                 \n5  Banking dominates Mongolia's finance sector with combined assets amounting to more than 80% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and more than 90% of finance sector assets in 2006. Banking comprises 16 commercial \nbanks, all of which have been privatized with four having foreign ownership. Following a series of banking crises in \n1994, 1996, and 1998, the financial performance of banks has, in general, improved over the last 3 years; and the \nsubsector was profitable between 2000 and 2006. Banks generally adhere to Basel Core Principles. The total \ncapital-to-asset ratio of banking increased from less than 4% in 1998 to 17% in 2005. Asset quality of banks has \nalso improved despite the rapid growth in lending\u2014annual credit grew on average by 81.5% between 2000 and \n2005 and by 42% in 2006 primarily driven by economic recovery, a more competitive financial market structure, \nand foreign capital inflows. The officially reported nonperforming loan ratio declined from 54% in 1999 to 9% in \n2006 while loan loss reserves increased in line with Bank of Mongolia (BOM) guidelines. Notwithstanding this \nimprovement, banking remains at an early stage of overall development as indicated by the fact that most lending \nis short term and collateral based; and interest rates are high reflecting a shortage of term funding, inadequate \ncredit appraisal systems at many banks, and uncertainties in the law regarding nonjudicial foreclosure. The \nabsence of an effective collateral framework is a key impediment to financial intermediation. ADB. 2000. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance \nGrant to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 1743-MON and TA3459-MON, approved \non 22 June) supported measures to expand the types of collateral that banks can accept from immovable to \nmovable property and financial assets, and to reduce the cost of collateral registration. The Civil Code was \namended to allow banks to seize immovable property without a court decision. However, continuing ambiguity in \nthe legal framework removes a strong incentive for borrowers to meet their debt obligations. \n ", "  5     \nimproving  quality  when  the  ability  of  downstream  buyers  to  guarantee  premium  prices  is \nuncertain. The problem is one of a classic coordination failure while all the participants in value \nchains would be better off if they acted in concert with no one willing to act first. \n \n13.  The Government has tried to address this problem by funding upstream improvements \nthrough improved input supply, training, management support, infrastructure development, or \nbetter  support  services.  However,  these  investments  have  rarely  achieved  the  necessary \ncoordination  with  private  downstream  investments.  Consequently,  they  have  not  delivered \nproducts needed by downstream enterprises or the markets they serve and have failed to \ngenerate expected benefits. Furthermore, efficiency and flexibility are imperative if value chains \nare to be successful in today\u2019s global, highly competitive markets. Government programs are \nnot  especially  well-known  for  either  of  these  qualities. Value-chain  development  needs  an \ninnovative  approach  that  combines  the  flexibility,  efficiency,  and  information-gathering \nadvantages of the private sector to deliver publicly funded upstream investments for value-chain \ndevelopment in coordination with private investments in downstream improvements. \n \n14.  Changing  attitudes  among  Mongolian  agribusinesses  offer  an  opportunity  to  try \ninnovative approaches to value-chain development. Increasingly, enterprises are realizing that \nthey cannot grow without comprehensive value-chain development. In a small and increasingly \ncrowded domestic marketplace with increasingly quality-conscious consumers\u2500and having tried \nand failed to develop sustainable export businesses, some companies have become aware of \nthe need to take control of their supply chains and, particularly, of the need to take action \nthemselves to decisively determine the quality, quantity, and availability of their raw materials. \nProperly supported and encouraged, these mindset changes will have a significant effect on \nboth the quality and quantity of raw materials available, and ensure that basic production is \naligned with market needs and has significant positive rural development impacts.6 \n \n15.  Coordinated development of agriculture value chains is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy for \nMongolia (footnote 2), which targets increased market orientation. The ADB-funded Agriculture \nSector Development Project7 laid the foundation for production improvements by building up \nrural infrastructure and support services, inducing changes in production methods and planning, \nand  changing  mindsets  of  producers  from  centralist  approaches  to  increased  business \nawareness. However, achievements need to be channeled toward greater market orientation by \naligning production with specific supply chains and markets. ADB projects have consistently \ndemonstrated that agriculture development merely from supply perspectives does not allow \neffective commercialization and development. While previous development programs including \nthose under the Agriculture Sector Development Project have assisted players along the supply \nchain, the key lesson from previous assistance is that coordination of this support along the \nsupply chain is an essential next step. ADB projects in several countries have demonstrated \nthat coordination along supply chains yields stronger production responses and higher benefits. \n \n                                                 \n6  Through the process of creating their initial outline proposals (Supplementary Appendix A), a number of the private \nenterprises engaged during project preparation have developed comprehensive plans for integrated value-chain \ndevelopment. These plans recognize in concrete terms, and probably for the first time in Mongolia, the need for \ncompanies to think in a holistic manner about their business and its connections to both raw material supply and \nfinal markets, and to make strategic investments throughout the value chain in order to be able to target niche \nadded-value markets. As a result of this process, enterprises have developed plans to begin to resolve many of the \nproblems of the supply chain, raw material quality, reliability and frequency of supply, and other problems that \ncurrently plague agribusinesses. These plans have been developed in combination with their purely private \ninvestment plans for upgrading production facilities, reducing costs, and improving management and marketing. \n7  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia for the Agriculture Sector Development Project. Manila. \n ", " 6 \n16.  The  gender  aspect  of  value-chain  development  cannot  be  neglected.  Women  and \nagribusinesses run by women play a critical role in the production of agricultural raw materials. \nSeventy  percent  of  rural  women  are  unpaid  family  workers  engaged  in  informal  micro \nproduction, processing, and trading as well as household food manufacturers. Furthermore, \nincreased focus on developing the untapped potential of businesses run by women will have the \ndual benefit of increasing raw material quality and the certainty of supply while addressing \ngender aspects of rural poverty including gender income disparities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n17.  Although Mongolia\u2019s agriculture sector has received substantial assistance (Appendix 3), \nthe Project will be the first large-scale holistic approach to developing agriculture value chains \nspecifically aimed at sustaining and delivering premium value products. More importantly, the \nProject will, in a break with traditional models, provide private enterprises with resources to \nundertake value-chain investments that have typically been undertaken by public agencies. A \nproblem analysis is provided in Appendix 4. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The  project  impact  will  be  sustainable  agriculture  and  rural  growth  that  maintains \npremium value for Mongolian products. The outcome will be the reliable supply of premium \nvalue agriculture products to niche markets by selected enterprises. The outcome is expected to \nhave the desired impact beyond immediate project achievements because the Project will serve \nas a demonstration for enterprises and value-chain participants who are not immediate project \nbeneficiaries. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n19.  The Project will develop value chains to deliver unique premium value products to niche \nmarkets.  The  Project  will  deliver  these  outputs  through  three  components:  (i)  value-chain \ndevelopment, (ii) rural infrastructure and services development, and (iii) project management. \n \n20.  Value-Chain Development. This component is expected to make loans available to \napproximately 15 private enterprises (out of a total of 23 enterprises endorsed by the advisory \nboard established to oversee implementation of the project preparatory technical assistance \n[PPTA]),   to  undertake  value-chain  development  investments  that  have  high  public   goods \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n ", "  7     \ncontent and the potential to deliver premium value products to niche markets.8 The 23 endorsed \nenterprises prepared outline proposals with support from PPTA and endorsed by the project \nadvisory  board.  These  proposals  were  presented  to  commercial  bank  credit  officers  and \nmanagement, who selected those that they considered most creditworthy. PPTA consultants \nworked  with  the  15  most  creditworthy  companies  to  prepare  bankable  proposals  for \nconsideration by commercial banks. The final decision to approve loans to enterprises will be \nmade by commercial banks using their own loan appraisal methodology. Banks will make loans \nto enterprises using their own funds. Project funds will be used to make deposits at each \nparticipating bank to cover 50% of the loan disbursements to project enterprises by that bank. \nDeposits are expected to range from $300,000 to $1.5 million. If a loan is declared as a loss, the \ncommercial bank will be able to recover 50% of the principal outstanding from the deposit \naccount. Summaries of investment plans endorsed by the project advisory board are presented \nin Appendix 5. Detailed financial analyses of four representative investment plans are presented \nin Supplementary Appendix B. Full bankable proposals of the four representative enterprises \nare available as Supplementary Appendix C. The proposed supply chain investments address \nthe major constraints to value-chain development (paras. 7\u201311). The Project will promote social \nand  gender  responsiveness  of  enterprises  by  imparting  relevant  gender  awareness  and \ncapacity development training for management and assessing the performance and impact of \nproject enterprises from social and gender perspectives. \n \n21.  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Services  Development.  This  component  will  fund \ninvestments that will either support value chains in the longer term or have a large public good \nelement making them unattractive to private investors. Investments will build upon three priority \nareas  identified  in  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Strategy  Study:  (i)  development  of \nlivestock testing and veterinary extension centers, (ii) business advisory and technical support \nto agricultural cooperatives, and (iii) development of fodder supply and storage facilities to foster \nfodder market development. The Project will finance laboratory equipment, civil works, and \ntraining for veterinary centers; training for water point establishment and operation; stocking \nherds, equipment, and training for marketing cooperatives; and equipment and training for \nfodder  facilities.  Selection  criteria  for  investments  and  envisioned  procedures  for  their \ndevelopment, implementation, and monitoring are in Appendix 6. Male and female community \n                                                 \n8  The project advisory board was chaired by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and had two representatives from the \nMinistry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), one representative from the Ministry of Industry and Trade, three civil \nsociety representatives, one representative from the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and one \nrepresentative from ADB. The project advisory board considered the following criteria when endorsing enterprises: \n(i) ownership of the enterprise is Mongolian, (ii) the enterprise is engaged in agribusiness, (iii) the enterprise has \nproducts and/or services that have the potential for premium value, (iv) the enterprise has been in operation at \nleast for 3 years, (v) the supply chain of the enterprise is located in Mongolia and is seen to make a substantial \nimpact in the agriculture sector, (vi) the enterprise has adequate machinery and equipment to fulfill its plan or \nproposes to procure the required machinery as part of its plan, (vii) the enterprise has chain captain status, and \n(viii) the public good element and positive social and environmental externalities of its proposed investment plan. A \ntransparent and rigorous procedure was applied to screen enterprises and is detailed in Supplementary Appendix \nA. Enterprises were invited to apply to the Project through advertisements in national newspapers and information \nseminars in major cities. Applicants were screened on the basis of the above criteria. The information of screened \ncompanies was physically checked and validated. The companies were then assisted in preparing investment \nproposals. The final screening of enterprises was made on the basis of the following criteria applied to their \ninvestment proposals: (i) type of raw materials purchased, (ii) source of purchases, (iii) annual value of purchases, \n(iv) purchasing system, (v) projected turnover increase, (vi) liabilities and/or turnover, (vii) expansion of production \ncapacity, (viii) modernization of final production, (ix) improved management and skills, (x) investments in supply \nchains, (xi) improved management of suppliers, (xii) improvements along supply chains, (xiii) improved raw \nmaterial  quality,  (xiv)  improved  finished  product  quality,  (xv)  development  of  new  value-added  products,  \n(xvi) development of uniquely Mongolian products, and (xvii) development of exports. The project advisory board \nendorsed 23 enterprises as being eligible to receive project funds; they were assisted by project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) consultants in preparing outline proposals. Project enterprises represent the milk, \nmeat, herbal products, fruit products, leather, and wool and cashmere sectors. \n ", " 8 \nmembers  will  be  consulted  in  the  identification,  selection,  and  possibly  implementation  of \ncommunity-based rural infrastructure and support service development investments. \n \n22.  Project Management. Two project management units (PMUs) will be established: one \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for the value-chain development component and one at the \nMinistry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) for the rural infrastructure and services development \ncomponent. Staff from PMUs, MoFA, MOF, project advisory board, and participating banks and \nenterprises will receive training (including gender awareness and capacity development for \nsocial and gender responsiveness) in line with the gender action plan in Appendix 7. The value-\nchain development PMU will work closely with participating banks to (i) ensure that proceeds of  \nthe  grant  are  deposited  into  deposit  accounts  in  accordance  with  respective  financing \nagreements; (ii) forecast funding requirements of the participating companies and arrange funds \nflow; (iii) monitor the use of funds against agreed plans; (iv) provide business advisory services \nand, in liaison with ADB and the Government, develop and assist in implementing corrective \nactions as necessary; (v) monitor performance of project enterprises; (vi) monitor compliance \nwith covenants and environmental and social performance of the investments, and help to \ncorrect  the  situation  as  necessary;  (vii)  organize  stakeholder  mobilization  and  gender \nawareness workshops including workshops to facilitate harmonization with relevant ongoing \nprojects; and (viii) prepare and submit required reports for the component. \n \n23.  Implementation of the rural infrastructure and services development component will be \nthe  responsibility  of  experts  from  MoFA  in  collaboration  with  aimag  (province)  agriculture \nexperts overseen by the MoFA project working group. PMU will assist MoFA by (i) assisting in \nevaluating investment proposals, (ii) forecasting funding requirements for the component and \narranging  funds  flow,  (iii)  monitoring  implementation  and  compliance  with  covenants,  (iv) \norganizing stakeholder mobilization and gender awareness workshops including workshops to \nfacilitate  harmonization  with  relevant  ongoing  projects,  and  (v)  preparing  and  submitting \nrequired  reports  for  the  component.  Investments  will  be  identified  in  consultation  with \ncommunities participating (or with the potential to participate) in supply chains of enterprises \nsupported by the Project. MoFA experts and project working group will coordinate selection. \nWhere available, informal herder groups like those established under the Agriculture Sector \nDevelopment Project, local community councils established under the World Bank\u2019s Sustainable \nLivelihoods Project, or other local organizations will be used as agents for local input into \ninvestment selection and implementation. \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant \n \n24.  Based  on  the  November  2005  debt  sustainability  analysis 9  and  revised  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grants framework, Mongolia is eligible for 100% grant financing. ADF \ngrants aim to provide development assistance to help the country tackle development issues in \nan environment of debt vulnerability; and assist the country in developing the private sector, \ncreating  employment  opportunities,  and  achieving  sustainable  economic  growth  without \nincreasing external debt burden. Grant effectiveness will be assessed within the broader context \nof program and project performance. The project design and monitoring framework have clear \nindicators to measure inputs, activities, and outputs (Appendix 1). \n \n                                                 \n9  World Bank. 2005.

Value-chain investments have public \ngoods  characteristics.  Benefits  from  these  investments  are  not  strictly  appropriable  by \ndownstream investors. For example, participants in the chain can redirect improved products \nand intermediate inputs resulting from investments of downstream investors to buyers other \nthan  the  investor.  Also,  many  investments  have  initial  costs  beyond  the  reach  of  small \nproducers.  Furthermore,  not  having  undertaken  such  investments  or  coordinated  actions, \nparticipants are not certain of their financial benefits. Initial returns are likely to be low as \nparticipants in the chain go through a period of learning as they improve coordination and \nmanagement, set up delivery systems, adopt technologies, and establish information systems. \nFinally, the early period could have participants reneging on contracts or otherwise subverting \nagreements as they go through a period of realizing the gains of long-term partnerships. Private \ninvestment in such development, therefore, is less than optimal because of the uncertainty, \nlearning, and coordination problems. Special consideration for the public goods nature of value-\nchain investments is, therefore, necessary; and a case for public support is credible. \n \n26.  A case for public support for value-chain investments can be motivated also by their \npositive spillover effects. As the benefits to long-term partnerships along supply chains are \ndemonstrated,  other  enterprises  and  producers  will  be  induced  into  developing  such \npartnerships and, thereby, increasing the efficiency of the sector as a whole and incomes of \nmore than the initial participants. In the particular case where supply chains are developed to \nrealize the potential in the markets for premium-value products, positive environmental and \nsocial externalities will be substantial. Enterprises targeting such markets will have to ensure \nthat their supply chains adhere to standards demanded by the markets and, therefore, will \nundertake investments with particularly high positive social and environmental impacts. Finally, \npublic  support  for  value-chain  development  through  project  enterprises  will  strengthen  the \nfinancial system by increasing the capacity of commercial banks to move from the currently \nprevalent collateralized short-term lending to lending against potential cash flow and business \nprospects. \n \n27.  Enterprises  endorsed  by  the  project  advisory  board  have  developed  integrated \ninvestment  plans  that  include  investments  in  the  supply  chain,  improved  or  expanded \nproduction, new and improved products, enhanced internal capacity, and improved marketing \nactivities. The most critical elements of these plans from the point of view of the companies are \nthe planned investments in improvements of raw material quality and the supply chain. The \nenterprises endorsed by the project advisory board have proposed using 34.4% of their total \ninvestments for capital equipment and buildings, 26.7% to improve supply chain management, \nand 38.9% for working capital. A detailed description of proposed investments is provided in \nAppendix 5. \n \n28.  Benefits of the Financial Intermediary Loan Modality. Traditional modes of funding \npublic investments are not suitable for value-chain development. Such investments through \nseparate government-funded programs have not been sufficiently flexible or coordinated with \nprivate investments. The financial intermediary loan modality will overcome this shortcoming by \nproviding private enterprises with funds to undertake quasi-public investments that support their \nown purely private value-chain development investment plans. This will ensure that investments \nwith substantial public goods content and high economic, social, and environmental benefits are \nfully integrated with commercial investment decisions. At the same time, due diligence applied \nby commercial banks to the value-chain development proposals will ensure that the investments \nare financially viable. Given that commercial banks will make loans to enterprises using entirely \n ", " 10 \ntheir own funds, the requirement to relend ADB grant proceeds to a financial intermediary10 is \nnot applicable. Because private enterprises will borrow funds for the investments, they are \nexpected to ensure that procurement is undertaken with accepted commercial practices. The \nloan  disbursement  systems  of  participating  banks  will  provide  an  established  channel  for \nfunding and collecting repayments. ADB\u2019s direct supervision of procurement and disbursement \nwill not be necessary. \n \n29.  Provision of a Unifying Core to a Diverse Range of Initiatives. The Project will focus \nthe resources of many ongoing and planned initiatives on value-chain development. The Rural \nEconomies Development Project funded by German development assistance through German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) provides credit guarantees and advisory services to \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses. Agreement has been reached with GTZ that the Rural \nEconomies Development Project will focus resources on project value chains. The Market \nAccess for the Poor Project funded by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) \naims to increase the added value of agriculture products, improve raw material quality, and \nimprove access to finance. Agreement has been reached with IFAD that the market access \nproject will assist project enterprises with the parts of their investment plans that deal with basic \nproduction. In addition, it will mobilize 20 grassroots groups integrated in project value chains \nand support them in developing and financing business plans to participate in project supply \nchains.  IFAD  is  also  assisting  two  project  enterprises  through  a  pilot  program  to  test \narrangements for partnerships with participants in their supply chains. A joint ADB\u2013IFAD review \nof the pilot will be used to strengthen implementation arrangements for the Project at the end of \nthe second year of implementation. A component of the Sustainable Livelihood Project funded \nby the World Bank will help herder groups develop and implement pasture management plans. \nThe World Bank has agreed that the component will be pilot tested in project supply chains. If \nsuccessful, the pilots will be replicated in more project supply chains through the Project\u2019s rural \ninfrastructure and services development component. \n \nE.

The Government has requested grant financing of $14,720,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to finance the Project. The Government will finance $0.67 million in \ntaxes and duties and a portion of the cost of management of the rural infrastructure and \nservices development component. Participating banks will provide $11.00 million in loans to \nproject enterprises using their own funds. The loans are expected to have terms up to 7 years \nwith grace periods up to 3 years during which interest will be paid. Commercial banks will \ndetermine  interest  rates  using  market-based  assessments.  The  enterprises  will  contribute \n$20.37 million of their own funds. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank ADF Grant  14.72  31.0 \nGovernment    1.41  3.0 \nCommercial Banks  11.00  23.2 \nEnterprises  20.37  42.8 \n  Total  47.50  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n32.  Participating banks will lend to enterprises using entirely their own funds at rates no less \nthan the prevailing ordinary capital resources rate with market-based spreads on individual \nloans reflecting the credit risk assessed by the banks themselves and their cost of funds.12 The \nflow of funds under the Project is shown in Supplementary Appendix D. Every time a bank \nmakes a disbursement for a project loan, the Government will deposit funds into a deposit \naccount at that bank in dollars and togrog to guarantee 50% each of the dollar and togrog loan \ndisbursement to the enterprises. The deposit account will always show a balance equal to 50% \nof the total outstanding principal balance on loans made by the bank to project enterprises. If a \nproject loan is declared as a loss by a bank in its reporting to Bank of Mongolia (with the \nendorsement of the value-chain development PMU), the deposit account balance will be debited \nby the bank by an amount equal to 50% of the loan amount declared as a loss. PMU and ADB \nwill review each loan agreement between the bank and the project enterprises to ensure that \nthe cost and margin structure of the proposed lending is fair and transparent.

Lending rates have dropped from 26.6% in \n2002 to 20% in 2006 while deposit rates have dropped from around 14% in 2002 to 13.5% in 2006.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n33.   The project advisory board established to oversee PPTA will monitor implementation \nand ensure coordination across components. The board will have two representatives from \nMOF (including the chairperson); one representative each from MoFA, the Ministry of Nature \nand Environment (MNE), and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Representatives of ADB may \nattend meetings as observers. Representatives of project enterprises and civil society may be \ninvited to meetings as observers when necessary. The board will meet at least every 6 months \nto review progress and will receive quarterly reports on implementation of each of the two \ncomponents.  A  project  manager  will  be  appointed  as  secretary  to  the  board  and  will  be \nresponsible for implementation of the board\u2019s decisions. The project manager will report to the \nboard and will be responsible for the overall management of the Project, management of the \nproject  imprest  account,  facilitation  of  community-based  monitoring  of  the  Project,  and \ncoordination  of  activities  that  impact  across  different  components  and  with  other  projects \nundertaken by other agencies in Mongolia.  \n \n34.

By making an interest free deposit equivalent to 50% of the loan principal, the Project will \neffectively lower the commercial bank's cost of funds on the loan by 50%. The subsidy is justified on the grounds of \nthe strong public goods nature of the planned investments by the enterprises. The subsidy is intended to help \ndevelop term lending to agribusiness by encouraging commercial banks to engage in term lending initially by \nproviding them with a set of well-screened potential clients. During its transition to a market economy, ADB has \nconsistently supported the reform and development of Mongolia's finance sector. The Government and ADB are \ncurrently implementing the Financial Regulation and Governance Program. Building on progress achieved under \ntwo Financial Sector Program loans, the Financial Regulation and Governance Program aims to help develop a \nsound and broad-based finance sector using a holistic approach to address the remaining legal and regulatory, \ninstitutional, and policy constraints. A broad-based financial system compromising banks, nonbank financial \ninstitutions, savings and credit cooperatives, securities markets, and the insurance subsector reduces the risks \nassociated with overreliance on the banking system and increases the supply of long-term capital for productive \ninvestment. It will, in turn, promote growth and create jobs. Increased competition from alternative sources of \nfinancial intermediation will enhance efficiency, and the financial system as a whole will become more resilient to \nexogenous shocks. The Financial Regulation and Governance Program's objectives are to (i) reduce the cost of \nborrowing and expand access to credit by improving the collateral framework, (ii) improve governance in banks to \nprotect depositors, (iii) enhance the role of the nonbank financial subsector in mobilizing savings for investment \ncapital, and (iv) improve investor confidence by reducing risks from money laundering through the financial system. \n ", "  13     \nwill sign financing agreements with participating commercial banks.14 MOF will establish an \nindependent  PMU  to  manage  this  component.  A  full-time  PMU  director  responsible  for \nimplementation and supported by consultants will report to the project manager. PMU will work \nin collaboration with the participating banks which will appoint project coordinators from among \ntheir staff. PMU will ensure that funds received by the banks are disbursed in accordance with \nthe financing agreements and that the use of funds by enterprises is in accordance with the \napproved investment plan. It will conduct spot audits to prevent collusion between banks and \nborrowing enterprises and other misdemeanors in the use of project funds. MoFA will be the \nExecuting Agency for the rural infrastructure and services development component and the \nportion  of  the  project  management  component  associated  with  the  rural  infrastructure \ncomponent. MoFA will establish a PMU for the component. MoFA has established a working \ngroup to oversee implementation of this component and will provide technical experts from \nMoFA  to  assist  in  project  implementation. 15  A  full-time  PMU  director  responsible  for \nimplementation  of  the  component  and  supported  by  consultants  will  report  to  the  project \nmanager. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n35.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years from 2008 to 2012. The value-chain \ninvestments are expected to be completed over 4 years. Participating banks will administer the \noutstanding  loans  after  project  completion.  Rural  infrastructure  and  services  development \ninvestments will be completed by year 4. An implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n36.  With the assistance of the value-chain development PMU, where applicable, project \nenterprises will be encouraged to follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, Section 3.12 (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time),  and  undertake  procurement  in  accordance  with  established \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  To  be  acceptable,  the \nenterprises will (i) demonstrate that procedures are appropriate in the circumstances; (ii) ensure \n                                                 \n14  Khan Bank was selected as a partner in the Project through consultation with MOF and BOM because it (i) is \nfinancially sound, (ii) meets BOM\u2019s prudential requirements, (iii) has adequate staff for the management of project \nfunds, (iv) has an acceptable record of medium-sized corporate lending, and (v) has at least 20% of its loan \nportfolio in rural areas. The complete due diligence report on Khan Bank is available in Supplementary Appendix E. \nOther commercial banks will be selected if they meet the same criteria and are considered acceptable to MOF, \nBOM, and ADB; and due diligence of the bank (conducted to the same standard as that conducted on Khan Bank) \nis considered to be acceptable by the Government and ADB. The Banking Law, enacted in 1996 and amended \nseveral times, provides the legal basis for BOM to regulate and supervise banking. About 40 staff members are in \ncharge of supervising 16 banks. BOM has made substantial progress in strengthening its regulatory capacities in \nrecent years. The International Monetary Fund has been supporting BOM in establishing and upgrading various \nregulations. The loan classification and loan loss provisioning standards are simple, conservative, and well-\nimplemented. The classification criteria consist of quantitative criteria based on the duration of loans overdue and \nqualitative criteria based on the conditions of borrowers. To minimize discretion, the qualitative criteria are only \nused to downgrade the classification derived from the quantitative criteria and are mainly based on numerical \nindicators such as return on assets (net profit as a percentage of assets) and capital-asset ratio. The amount of \nloan loss provisioning is determined according to the classification under BOM guidelines (e.g., 1% for performing, \n5% for past due). The required provisioning rates for substandard and doubtful loans were increased by the \namendment of the guidelines (25%\u201340% for substandard, and 50%\u201375% for doubtful) in 2004. Commercial banks \nsubmit  loan  classification  reports  monthly  to  BOM.BOM  has  established  a  standard  set  of  prudential  ratio \nregulations  including  for  (i)  capital  adequacy,  (ii)  liquidity,  (iii)  credit  concentration,  and  \n(iv) foreign exchange risk. Banks are required to submit reports on these indicators every month. A prompt \ncorrective action program was established to allow BOM to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized \nbanks from an order to cease paying dividends to placement of the bank in conservatorship depending on capital \ninadequacy. \n15  Technical expertise is expected to be needed in civil engineering, extension, and participatory planning. \n ", " 14 \nthat goods and services financed using project funds are purchased with consideration to \neconomy and efficiency at a reasonable price, given time of delivery, quality, and efficiency; and \n(iii) ensure that goods and services to be financed by project funds are procured from ADB \nmember  countries.  Enterprises  will  be  encouraged  to  procure  goods  through  international \ncompetitive bidding and shopping, when applicable, in the interest of economy and efficiency. \nThe Government has agreed to use ADB procurement procedures with regard to economy and \nefficiency. PMU will oversee procurement by enterprises to ensure that ADB guidelines are \nfollowed. In case of noncompliance, the Government will have the right to recall the loan to the \nviolating enterprise. For all other procurement, contracts for goods estimated to cost more than \n$0.5 million and contracts for works estimated to cost more than $1.0 million will be procured \nusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost less than the ICB values but equal to or more than $100,000 will be procured through \nnational competitive bidding procedures in accordance with standard government procedures \nsubject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less \nthan  $100,000  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents \nand contracts. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n37.  The Project will require 436 person-months of consulting services: 42 person-months \ninternational and 394 person-months national. All consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Technical experts will be recruited individually by the value-chain development PMU as \nrequested by project enterprises to support enterprises in the implementation of their investment \nplans. Recruitment will be through a cost-sharing arrangement whereby enterprises requesting \nexperts will bear 60% of the costs of engagement. The project manager, both project directors, \nand staff of both PMUs will be engaged individually. The remaining consultants will be recruited \nthrough  firms  under  two  packages  (one  package  each  for  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent and the rural infrastructure and services development component) following quality- \nand cost-based selection procedures using an 80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio.16 The outline terms of \nreference are provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nExecuting Agencies. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate directly or through its agents any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n                                                 \n16  The following national consultants will be required for the value-chain development component: agribusiness \nspecialist and/or project director, project monitoring specialists, financial analysts, business advisors, environment \nspecialist, and social and/or gender specialist. For the rural infrastructure component, the following national \nconsultants will be required: project director, project monitoring specialist, environment specialist, social and/or \ngender  specialist.  The  following  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  for  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent: value-chain development advisor, and technical experts. A project manager will be recruited for overall \ncoordination. \n ", "  15     \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n39.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate funds flow on the value-chain development \ncomponent, each participating bank will open a special account and will, with the endorsement \nof the value-chain development PMU, apply to ADB through MOF for advance deposits into the \nspecial account to cover 50% of projected disbursements to enterprises for project investment \nplans during the next 6 months. Upon receipt of this request, ADB will disburse funds in dollars \nto the special account. The participating commercial bank will make transfers from the special \naccount to a deposit account equal to 50% of every disbursement made by the commercial \nbank to project enterprises for project investment plans. The deposits into the deposit account \nwill be in dollars and togrog\u2014 guaranteeing 50% each of the dollar and togrog disbursement to \nthe enterprise.17 The commercial banks will use procedures to liquidate transfers from the value-\nchain development special account to the project deposit account in accordance with rules \nspelled out in financing agreements between MOF and the commercial banks. The participating \ncommercial banks will release funds to MOF from the project deposit account equal to 50% of \nevery principal repayment that they receive on project loans (after deducting interest payment to \nthe commercial bank).18 The commercial bank will have entered into a loan agreement with a \nproject enterprise (that stipulates use of funds) endorsed by ADB including terms and conditions \nrequired by ADB prior to making disbursements to the enterprise. Before any project loan is \ndeclared as a loss, the value-chain development PMU and the commercial bank will make all \nreasonable efforts to either revive the business or recover the outstanding loan amount. \n \n40.  The Government will establish an imprest account for the Project at a commercial bank \nacceptable to ADB to be managed by the project manager. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe account will not exceed estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the grant \namount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed between the Government and \nADB. Statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing eligible expenses \nor liquidating advances to the imprest account. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or \nliquidated under SOE procedures will not exceed $50,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n41.  MOF, MoFA, and participating commercial banks will maintain separate accounts and \nfinancial statements for project funds in accordance with appropriate accounting standards and \nhave these audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The use of special \nand imprest accounts and SOE procedures will be part of the audit, and a separate opinion will \nbe  submitted.  Enterprises  receiving  project  funds  will  be  required  to  maintain  accounts \naccording  to  international  accounting  standards  and  to  have  these  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.19 The  audit  report  covering  the  audited  project \naccounts and financial statements for each fiscal year will be submitted to ADB in English not \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The project manager, through the advisory \nboard, will submit quarterly reports and diagnostic semiannual reports to ADB detailing project \nprogress, problems, measures taken to overcome them, and expected progress over the next 6 \nmonths as well as any major issues. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the \nproject manager, through the advisory board, will submit a project completion report to ADB \ndetailing  the  utilization  of  grant  proceeds,  project  implementation  analysis,  and  the \n                                                 \n17  The exchange rate to be applied when converting from dollars to togrog will be the commercial bank\u2019s reference \nbuying rate for dollars on the date of the disbursement to the project enterprise. \n18  Releases to MOF will be in the same currency as repayments from the project enterprises. \n19  Enterprises will adopt international accounting standards within 2 years of receiving project funding. \n ", " 16 \nsocioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project  with  special  attention  to  poverty  reduction.  The \nGovernment  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of  audited  project \naccounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the ADB grant in \ncase of noncompliance. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n42.  The two PMUs overseen by the project manager will monitor project performance as part \nof  quarterly  reporting  to  the  advisory  board,  the  respective  Executing  Agency,  and  ADB \nincorporating a community-based monitoring system. Monitoring of value-chain investments will \nfollow business development and monitoring plans prepared by the value-chain development \nPMU with project enterprises to ensure that enterprises are utilizing project funds for intended \npurposes and that expected results are being produced. PMUs (with assistance from the social \ndevelopment specialist) will establish a (sex-disaggregated) database; carry out annual review \nand consultations on the social, gender, and participatory aspects of the Project; and ensure the \ncollection of sex-disaggregated end-line data and information. Any deviations in the use of funds \nby enterprises will, if possible, be resolved in consultation between PMU and the enterprises. \nADB must endorse major modifications. PMU will monitor rural infrastructure projects using \nstandard  reporting  and  periodic  field  visits.  Data  on  inputs  and  outcomes  of  the  rural \ninfrastructure and services development component will be organized using software developed \nby the Agriculture Sector Development Project (footnote 7). To identify baseline indicators on \ninfrastructure availability and stakeholder needs, PMU will commission a survey and prepare an \ninventory of existing infrastructure and support service programs once an eligible locality has an \napproved  subproject  proposal.  The  survey  will  be  repeated  and  inventory  updated  at  the \nconclusion of subproject implementation. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n43.  MOF,  MoFA,  participating  commercial  banks,  and  ADB  will  review  the  Project \nsemiannually. A midterm review, not later than 2 years and 6 months after commencement, will \ninclude a comprehensive evaluation of implementation arrangements and progress as well as \nstakeholder consultations. Recommendations will be made for adjustments as appropriate to \nthe  project  scope,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation  arrangements.  Three  months  after \nproject completion, the impact of the Project will be evaluated according to a schedule and \nterms of reference to be agreed by MOF, MoFA, and ADB. \n \nIV.  PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n44.  The  accompanying  TA  for  Agricultural  Marketing  and  Brand  Development  will  be \ndirected  to capitalizing on  opportunities in  niche  markets  to  develop  a  premium  brand  for \nMongolian agriculture products. The brand development will be primarily aimed at developing \npartnerships between Mongolian enterprises and external premium brands to develop virtual \nvertically integrated value chains. The long-term objective could be to provide an opportunity for \nMongolian enterprises to develop their own indigenous consumer brands for the export market. \nA number of high-end brands (i) want to stay away from mass production price discounts, and \n(ii) would be interested in building the idea of Mongolia as a premium and/or exclusive product \nsource. For example, Loro Piana and Dunhill have been building up Mongolia as a premium \nsource  of  products.  Furthermore,  companies  such  as  Burberry  and  Diesel  are  known  for \ndeveloping strong links with suppliers to improve their information technology and production \ncapabilities. Enterprises selected for funding through the Project have inherent elements of \nperformance, process, and origin to varying degrees. The TA will build on and combine these to \nprovide a platform for creating credible and compelling brands.  \n ", "  17     \n45.  The TA will contribute to realizing the impact of the Project\u2014agriculture and rural growth \nthat sustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. The outcome of the TA will \nbe the creation of a process for brand development and management that is sustainable and \nreplicable  while  providing  a  demonstration  effect.  The  TA  output  will  be  to  develop  and \ndemonstrate  a  process  for  collaborative  brand  development  including  a  brand  framework, \ncontent of business proposals, and an institutional framework for sustained brand management \nand development including a business plan for a brand management agency, three model brand \npartnership agreements between Mongolian enterprises and international brands, and three \ncollaborative  brands.  Activities  will  involve  building  a  hypothetical  brand  case,  facilitating \npartnerships and enterprise selection (including internal and external surveys), designing brand \nproposals and proposal packs, making proposals, brokering partnerships and concluding deals, \ndefining the collaborative brand, creating brand collateral, conducting the brand trial, and finally, \nlaunching the brand. \n \n46.  Appendix 11 provides the terms of reference, cost estimates, and financing plan for the \nTA. The estimated TA cost is $2.2 million equivalent. An ADB grant of $2,000,000 equivalent is \nproposed from the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill finance $200,000 equivalent to cover remuneration of counterpart staff and the costs of \nadditional transport, surveys, and documents. Brand development will be contracted out to an \ninternational branding firm. Selection will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nEquipment will be procured using shopping following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. MOF will \nbe the Executing Agency. An independent PMU will implement the TA and gradually evolve into \na branding agency. The TA is expected to commence in December 2008 and be completed by \nDecember 2010. Equipment procured through the TA will be transferred to MOF upon TA \ncompletion. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n47.  Economic and Financial Benefits. The Project will foster sustainable agriculture and \nrural development. Mongolian agriculture products will claim at least a 30% price premium over \ncomparable products in target markets by 2015 after project investments. In addition to direct \nbenefits, the Project has substantial demonstration benefits. The resolution of uncertainties and \ncoordination problems are expected to induce project enterprises to expand their value-chain \ninvestments by at least 20% over project-funded levels within 5 years of project completion. The \nProject is expected to induce at least 25 additional enterprises to undertake similar value-chain \ninvestments within the same period. Since the premium value of Mongolian agriculture products \nderives  from  custodianship  of  the  environmental  and  social  responsibility  and,  therefore, \nprovides incentives for environmental and social responsibility, the Project will have substantial \npositive environmental and social benefits that are difficult to quantify. The economic analysis is \nin Appendix 12 and further details in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n48.  Poverty Reduction, Social, Gender, and Environmental Impacts. The Project will \nhave  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction.  Direct  impacts  will  come  from \nemployment in expanded enterprise operations and higher rural incomes from higher value at \nthe basic production and intermediate supply chain level. Incomes of agriculture producers \nparticipating in the supply chains are expected to increase by an average of at least 60% from \n2008 to 2015. At least 2,500 families will benefit from project investments, and investments are \nexpected  to  create  at  least  800  new  jobs.  The  Government  of  Japan  has  approved  an \nassociated  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)-funded  project,  Water  Point \nEstablishment and Extension Stations for Poor Herding Families. It will increase the access of \n ", " 18 \nespecially disadvantaged communities to rural infrastructure and support services, and give \nparticular attention to the issue of indigenous groups. A JFPR-funded project  for Income \nImprovements for Herders and Intermediaries is being conceptualized for approval in 2009 to \nimprove the access of socially disadvantaged groups to project benefits and to mitigate negative \nimpacts on small intermediaries and indigenous groups.20 \n \n49.  The Project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. No land acquisition \nor demolition of fixed assets will be required for project implementation. PMUs will monitor \ninvestments  and,  if  adverse  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  associated  with  project \ninvestments, further disbursements to the enterprise involved or the relevant rural infrastructure \ninvestment will be subject to compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nThe Project is classified as category B for impact on indigenous peoples as it will have no \nadverse impact. The two JFPR projects (para. 48) are being designed to address issues related \nto  socially  disadvantaged  groups.  They  will  specifically  take  into  account  issues  of  ethnic \nminorities and ensure that they benefit from and are not adversely impacted by the Project. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n50.  An environmental assessment is provided in Appendix 14. The Project is classified as \ncategory B in terms of environmental impacts. For the value-chain development component, the \nsample initial environmental examination (IEE) of four representative value-chain development \ninvestment plans was undertaken. If selected, the enterprises will undergo the environmental \nassessment and review procedure (EARP) process and will prepare detailed environmental \nassessments in accordance with MNE and ADB requirements. For the rural infrastructure and \nservices  development  component,  the  indicative  rural  infrastructure  and  support  service \ndevelopment  investments  were  reviewed;  and  the  scale  and  nature  of  activities  are  not \nexpected  to  have  any  significant  environmental  impact.  Thus,  this  project  component  is \nclassified as category C under the ADB environmental assessment criteria. MNE concurs with \nthis conclusion. Reviews of both project components conclude that the Project is not expected \nto result in significant environmental impacts warranting an environmental impact assessment. \nA summary IEE was prepared and is available as Supplementary Appendix H. The key element \nof the summary is the EARP for the value-chain investment plans. EARP was discussed and \nhas the agreement of MNE. \n \n51.  The brand image targeted by the Project will depend upon environmentally sustainable \nproduction along the supply chain. Production practices that fit into the brand image will derive a \npremium from protecting the environment and preserving the traditional lifestyle and culture. \nThe Project, therefore, goes beyond safeguard measures to minimize negative impacts and is \nexpected to contribute to actively protecting the environment and cultural identity. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n52.  Inadequate  capacity  of  enterprises  to  implement  investment  plans,  delays  in \nprocurement, delivery delays by contractors, and misuse of funds by enterprises pose risks to \nproject outputs. These risks will be addressed by project management support. The value-chain \ndevelopment PMU will provide advisory services to ensure smooth implementation of plans. \nPMU for the rural infrastructure and services development component will provide procurement \nand implementation support. Both PMUs will assist in developing contracts holding contractors \nliable for delivery delays. The value-chain development PMU will monitor the use of funds by \n                                                 \n20  Activities may include training for herders (setting up groups or cooperatives among herders), mitigation measures \nfor smaller changers including business reorientation for them, and provision of lower interest rate loans to herders \nand changers. \n ", "  19     \nenterprises; close monitoring by ADB and the banks will provide assurance on their use. Project \noutcomes could be at risk if enterprises cannot operate and manage expanded and upgraded \nvalue  chains.  Investment  plans  have  taken  this  into  account  and  provided  for  consultant \nsupport. This risk will be further mitigated through advisory services provided by PMU and \nparallel  projects  implemented  by  GTZ  and  IFAD.  Some  breach  of  contracts  is  expected, \nespecially  in  the  early  stages.  However,  this  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  lending  for  working \ncapital\u2014suppliers often renege on contracts because enterprises are not able to make advance \npayments for procurement. Another risk to outcomes is the failure of participants to understand \nthe nature of niche markets and expectations. Complementary TA will create internal brand \nawareness to mitigate this risk. Project impacts will be at risk if some enterprises fail to meet \nexport targets and negatively impact the brand. This risk will be mitigated through project \nmanagement support and by accompanying TA to establish partnerships between international \ncompanies and enterprises. These partnerships will allow enterprises access to international \nexpertise and advice making it easier to deliver on expectations. Another risk is that some \ndomestic  enterprises  \u201cfree-ride\u201d  on  the  brand  with  bad  products.  The  long-term  mitigating \ncounterbalance to this will be the development of associations to act as custodians of the brand. \nToward this end, accompanying TA will develop partnerships with initiatives of the United States \nAgency for International Development and GTZ. Finally, adverse incentives may be provided for \nbanks and enterprises to collude to capture project funds. However, the Project is designed \nsuch that project funds can be captured only if the banks\u2019 own funds are also captured through \ncollusion. The internal control mechanisms of Khan Bank, a participating commercial bank, are \nconsidered adequate to detect such collusion. The mechanisms of any additional participating \nbanks will be checked during due diligence to ensure that they would detect such collusion. \nAlso, since banks are not subject to unilateral first loss, they might subject investments to less \nthan  full  due  diligence.  The  thorough  preparation  that  investment  proposals  of  project \nenterprises have been subjected to provides a degree of comfort on the creditworthiness of \nproposals in addition to due diligence by banks. Finally, a perceived risk is that having the \ndeposit account in the same bank that makes the loans will make the account vulnerable to a \nraid  by  the  commercial  bank.  However,  this  risk  is  no  greater  than  that  for  other  deposit \naccounts in Mongolia. This risk is not considered substantial. All the potential risks from moral \nhazard or adverse incentives will be additionally mitigated by spot audits performed by PMU. \nAny  misdemeanors  will  subject  the  involved  commercial  bank  and  borrower  to  immediate \ndisqualification from participating in the Project. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n53.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Within 3 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will ensure that PMUs \nare established in a manner acceptable to ADB, headed by a project director, \nand staffed with competent personnel. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that project enterprises use project loan proceeds \nfor the purpose of the investment plan endorsed by the advisory board and that \nthe recommendations of PMU in case of deviations are followed. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations for counterpart \nfunds are made, approved, and released for proper project implementation. The \nGovernment will provide adequate office and other facilities necessary for timely \nand effective project implementation. \n(iv)  Except as agreed with ADB, the Government will not grant any debt amnesty, or \nforgive loan repayment obligations with respect to the project loans. \n ", " 20 \n(v)  The Government will ensure that within 2 years of the first disbursement to each \nproject  enterprise,  the  enterprise  will  produce  annual  financial  statements \ncertified by independent auditors acceptable to ADB in line with international \naccounting standards. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  project  activities  are  carried  out  (a)  in \naccordance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations of Mongolia, \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the  IEEs  and  summary  IEE;  and  \n(b) in compliance with EARP. \n(vii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  IEEs  prepared  for  the  four \nrepresentative enterprises is reviewed and updated in accordance with EARP at \nthe stage of approval of the financing proposal of each such enterprise and \nsubmitted to and approved by MNE prior to start of civil works or procurement. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that public consultation and information disclosure \nprocedures are conducted in accordance with MNE and ADB requirements for \neach  investment  plan  classified  as  a  category  B  project  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy.  \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that the Project shall not cause any land acquisition, \nresettlement, or limits on access to land. In the event of (a) any involuntary \nresettlement;  (b)  land acquisition; or  (c)  resettlement  activities  during  project \nimplementation,  the  Government  shall  inform  ADB,  prepare  necessary \nresettlement plans in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \nand  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  disclose  these \nresettlement plans to affected people and submit them to ADB for approval prior \nto award of civil works contracts.

A  key  characteristic  of  manufacturing  in  Mongolia  is  the  wide  range  of  industries \ndependent  upon  agricultural  raw  materials.  These  include  meat  processing,  dairy,  leather \ntannery,  leather  footwear  and  products,  fur  garments,  cashmere  processing  and  garment \nmanufacturing, camel hair processing and garment production, wool carpets and blankets, felt \nshoes and other felt products, and fruit and wild berry products. As many agroprocessing \nenterprises collapsed with the transition to a market-based economy, current production is only \na fraction of what it was (except for cashmere). Nevertheless, livestock raw materials still form \nthe basis for almost all the textile industry and a significant proportion of the food and garment \nindustries. Domestic agribusiness enterprises face keen competition from manufacturers from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with their surplus capacity, economies of scale, and \nstrong government support. The PRC traders buy significant quantities of Mongolia\u2019s livestock \nproducts  (mainly  fibers  and  hides).  In  addition,  domestic  manufacturers  face  a  worsening \nsituation with respect to the quality of raw materials; this affects their processing efficiency and \nmarketing of end products. The progressive decline in the quality of Mongolian livestock raw \nmaterial is due to the rapid buildup of numbers when quality is sacrificed for quantity resulting in \ncoarser cashmere and wool fibers, and blemished skins. These have contributed to the dramatic \ndecline in most agriculture-based industries and serious underutilization of industrial capacity. \n \n2.  Cashmere.  The demand for classic cashmere garments remains high in the luxury \nsegments of European, American, and Japanese markets even though the temporarily higher \ndemand for them created by fashion designers during the early 2000s may have peaked. \nMongolia  is  the  second  largest  producer  of  raw  cashmere  accounting  for  25%  of  world \nproduction compared with the PRC\u2019s 70%. Mongolian production increased from an estimated \n1,000  tons  of  raw  cashmere  in  1990  to  3,000  tons  in  2000.  The  enterprises  involved  in \ncashmere  processing  and  garment  manufacturing  have  sophisticated  dehairing,  spinning, \ndyeing, weaving, and knitting equipment; some was upgraded in recent years. The industry \ncomprises  three  types  of  companies  each  with  their  own  characteristics,  markets,  and \nopportunities. First are the primary processing plants with varying degrees of foreign ownership \n(Europe,  Japan,  PRC,  Republic  of  Korea,  and  United  States).  These  joint  ventures  were \nestablished following the ban on raw cashmere exports in 1993 which was subsequently lifted in \n1996. They buy raw cashmere from herders, and scour and process it into dehaired cashmere \nfor export to the PRC and Europe (as dehaired cashmere), and Japan (as tops). The second \ngroup comprises integrated processors and garment manufacturers that have their own raw \nmaterial procurement network (contract buyers) and scouring, dehairing, spinning, dyeing, and \nautomated knitting and weaving manufacturing capacity. The state-owned Gobi Corporation and \nprivate  Buyan  Company  XXK  belong  to  this  group.  They  export  dehaired  cashmere  and \ngarments depending on the relative prices on international markets. The third group comprises \nlocal  and  foreign  companies  that  produce  knitted  cashmere  garments  from  hand-knitting \nmachines using imported yarn (from the PRC or Italy) for the quota-free United States market. \nThe  gross  industrial  output  from  the  manufacture  of  textiles  and  apparel  (dominated  by \ncashmere) was MNT100 billion in 2005. \n \n3.  Carpets and Other Wool Products. Mongolia produces large quantities of coarse wool, \nsome of which is discarded in the countryside due to the poor transport infrastructure (high \ntransport costs) and limited demand. Ninety-four percent of Mongolia\u2019s clip comprises coarse \nfibers (suitable only for carpets, blankets, felt footwear, and insulating products), 4% is semi-\ncoarse, and only 1% is fine or semi-fine and suitable for garment production. Three major carpet \n                                                 \n1  This appendix is based on ADB. 2004. Mongolia: Agriculture Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \nproducers and one blanket producer have been privatized, two in Ulaanbaatar and one in \nErdenet. Their combined production capacity for scouring, spinning, knitting, and felt making is \nfar in excess of current production (UB Carpets XXK is operating at 60% capacity and is \nanxious  to  increase  production  if  the  raw  material  is  available).  However,  the  production \ntechnology  for  carpet  manufacturing  is  outdated  and  inflexible.  Similarly,  felt  and  felt  boot \nproduction is operating at about 10% of plant capacity. \n \n4.  Meat  and  Small  Goods.  One  of  the  challenges  for  the  slaughtering  and  meat \nprocessing industries in Mongolia, as in other countries, is the seasonality of supply\u2014although \nthis  is  more  pronounced  in  Mongolia.  From  October  to  December,  abattoirs  operate  at \nmaximum capacity, some even doing shift work to handle the seasonal flush. With little out of \nseason production, these facilities remain inoperative for the remainder of the year with only \ntheir freezers being used to store meat and carcasses. The situation is made more complex as \nabout 70%\u201380% of animals destined for domestic consumption are slaughtered outdoors. The \nGovernment is concerned about the hygiene of meat produced in this manner and is seeking to \ndirect a greater proportion of the kill through abattoirs with established hygiene standards and \nwhere trace-back mechanisms can be introduced to monitor disease. Mongolian meat has been \nvery competitive at $0.6\u2013$0.8/kilogram of beef (2004), half the price in the PRC and one third of \nthe price in the Russian Federation. More recently, as supply shortages have become apparent \nfrom increased domestic consumption, meat prices have increased dramatically ($2.50/kilogram \nfor beef and slightly less for mutton) to the extent that the Government has chosen to introduce \nmeasures to stabilize meat prices at affordable levels for urban consumers. The industrial \noutput of food products in 2005 was MNT93 billion. \n \n5.  Four of the 26 slaughterhouses were established in 2002 with about 25% being licensed \nas export meat works. Historically, Mongolia has been a significant exporter of mutton and beef \nbut with the current domestic demand from increased urbanization and changing consumption \npatterns associated with higher incomes, the domestic market is more attractive and quantities \nexported declined to near zero in 2005 and 2006. Russian demand declined dramatically after \ntransition due to the lower purchasing power of its population, and it imposed a 20% duty on \nunprocessed meat and a 40% duty on processed meat products such as sausages and salami. \nWith the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2002, the Russian Federation and other markets \nhave been virtually closed although such action probably had little impact on the meat industry \nin view of domestic developments. \n \n6.  Dairy Products. The Mongolian population has traditionally enjoyed a high per capita \nconsumption  of  milk  comparable  to  that  of  developed  countries  due  to  its  high  livestock \npopulation and traditional dietary practices. Following the collapse of the domestic dairy industry \ndue to hasty privatization, the large domestic demand for milk and dairy products such as \ncheese and ice cream in urban centers has been met largely from imports. Liquid milk imports \nhave increased five fold in recent years; however, due to the high price, milk consumption is \nonly half of that in 1990. Domestic production of fresh milk is highly seasonal and marketable \nsurpluses are usually generated for a short period of the year. Milk factories have substituted \nfresh supplies by reconstituting imported milk powder, some of which is coming in to Mongolia \nunder  grant  assistance.  Some  liquid  consumption  is  met  from  small  dairy  plants  using \ndomestically produced milk\u2014pasteurized and unpasteurized\u2014the latter being sold in markets \nand on the street in unhygienic conditions and posing considerable health hazards. Small-scale \ndairy processing plants produce a range of dairy produce including yogurt, cheese, and other \ntraditional Mongolian dairy products supplying the urban centers and rural urban populations. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n7.  Before 1990, the largest dairy plant operating in Ulaanbaatar produced 40 million liters of \nmilk a year, supplied mainly by state-owned dairy farms in the city outskirts via a network of \ncollection points and holding centers along a sealed road to the central northern region. After \nprivatization of the national cattle herd, this collection system collapsed along with the state-run \nfarms. The highly subsidized intensive dairy farms also failed without coal to keep the animals \nwarm and feed to maintain their production. The previously government-owned Suu plant is now \noperating at 1% capacity. The use of domestically produced milk by processors based on small-\nscale producers surrounding the urban centers has increased slightly and private collection and \ncooling centers have been reestablished but the proportion of total consumption remains low. \n \n8.  Leather Products. Most Mongolian hides and skins are exported to the PRC either raw \nor as semiprocessed wet blue hides. The domestic demand for leather jackets, boots, and other \nproducts is now supplied by imports from as far as the Republic of Korea and Turkey whose \nproducts enjoy virtually duty-free access to the Mongolian market. Mongolian hides and skins \nare very competitively priced, almost half the price of those in the PRC, although some price \ndifferential is due to the generally smaller size of animals in Mongolia, their lighter skins, and \nquality aspects (blemishes from ectoparasites). The PRC traders are regular visitors to rural \nareas where they wander at will in search of hides. Since 1990, some 48 small- and medium-\nsized  companies  have  been  established  for  mainly  primary  processing  (24)  but  also  for \nprocessing fur (4), and leather and tannery products (10). These processors face difficulties in \nprocuring raw materials because their access to capital at reasonable interest rates coincides \nwith the peak buying period for livestock, and plants are run well below their capacity. For \nexample, the processing plant at Buligaar was recently upgraded with Italian machinery under a \ngovernment-to-government loan. The company has a large debt and management difficulties, \nand even closed down in 1997 for 4 years but reopened in 2001. It is still operating at 10% \ncapacity. \n \n ", "28   Appendix 3 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR \n(2000\u20132007) \n \nAmount   \nFunding Source and Title  Loan   Years of \nGrant \n($ million)  Implementation \n       \nAsian Development Bank       \n1.

Planned investments in an improved supply chain include the following. \n \n2.  Veterinary Services. Although nominal veterinary services are provided in all regions of \nMongolia, the extremely high parasitic damage on animal skins; decreasing quality of fibers \nsuch as cashmere, camel wool, and sheep wool; and regular disease outbreaks including hoof \nand mouth, anthrax, and bubonic plague clearly indicate that the current system is not effective \nin protecting animal health and in delivering the quality raw materials required by processors. \nPlanned investments include provision of dipping baths and other rural infrastructure for removal \nof ectoparasites, regular provision of anthelmintics to reduce endoparasites, training for herders \nin basic veterinary care and monitoring, provision of basic drugs for regular administration by \nherders, and regular professional herd inspections to ensure early disease detection. All the \ncompanies that will invest in this area are specialists with an interest in a particular species or \nparticular raw material. However, they recognize that their investment in improved veterinary \nservices will have to be made over very wide geographic areas and across all species within the \narea in order to be effective. \n \n3.  Breed Improvement, Breeding Programs, and Introduction of Improved Genetics. \nMany animal breeds in Mongolia are mixed largely as a result of repeated Soviet experiments in \ncrossbreeding over 50 years. Very few of these experiments were successful. For instance, \ncrossbreeding native Mongolian goats with Russian Don goats produced more fiber but at a \nsevere  cost  of  increasing  coarseness  with  the  result  that  much  Mongolian  cashmere  has \ndifficulty being competitive internationally with a current average 16.5 micron thickness versus \nan international standard of 14.5 micron. The same is true with many herbal resources; for \ninstance,  the  Soviet  cross-breeding  of  seabuckthorn  improved  harsh  weather  tolerance \nmarginally but resulted in plants with lower oil and nutrient yields and significantly shortened \ntheir productive life in some cases down to 15 years compared with the 25\u201330 productive years \nof the naturally occurring plant. Companies interested in investing in animal-origin raw materials \nare planning breed improvement programs to develop groups of premier breeding animals with \ncharacteristics as close as possible to the original native breeds. They will then provide these \nbreeding animals to herders who will use them to breed improved genetics into the herd over \nseveral generations. Although the companies will benefit from their investment in being able to \nobtain better quality raw materials, the greatest good from these programs will be public as the \ncompanies will have little or no control over the spread of the improved genetics. Companies \ninterested in sustainable exploitation of herbal resources, particularly seabuckthorn, recognize \nthe need to invest in improved genetics to ensure long-term sustainability of the resources and \ninternational-standard quantity and quality of oils, juices, and pulps. \n \n4.  Incentive Payments. Companies have developed plans to provide incentives to herders \nand farmers for the delivery of improved quality raw materials. Agricultural supply chains in \nMongolia have for many years been marked by a lack of price\u2013quality differentiation largely as a \nresult of aggressive competition for raw materials from the People\u2019s Republic of China. While \nproviding incentives to herders to deliver improved quality is an obvious strategy, processing \ncompanies already burdened by high costs and, with very short buying seasons that increase \nthe  pressure  on  working  capital,  have  been  unable  to  introduce  sustainable  programs.  In \nparticular,  without  the  other  elements  of  supply  chain  investment  noted  in  this  appendix \n(particularly veterinary service improvement and improvement of breeding and genetics), such \nprograms would produce little or nothing in terms of higher quality but would certainly increase \nthe cost of raw material. The introduction of sustainable incentive programs will mean that all \nherders and other suppliers, whether in the company initial target areas or not, will be able to \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \nbenefit  from  making  investments  themselves  targeted  to  improve  raw  material  quality.  In \naddition  to  monetary  incentives,  the  participating  companies  all  recognize  that  the  current \ninformality and uncertainty of the supply chain is a major disincentive to herders and farmers \nmaking  any  independent  investments  and  improvements.  The  majority  of  companies  are, \ntherefore, committed to working with a more formal contracting structure.  \n \n5.  Training.  Companies  plan  to  invest  in  ongoing  training  programs  for  quality \nimprovement, breeding, and horticultural and veterinary care. Many farmers and herders in \nMongolia are inexperienced largely because, until the transition, many were white-collar workers \nwho took to herding or farming only when the economy collapsed and herding became a \nnecessity for survival. This lack of experience, knowledge, and preparedness of many herders \nand farmers has been amply demonstrated in recent years by a series of dzuds (large-scale \ndeaths of livestock during a harsh winter due to lack of fodder preparation, winter shelter, etc.), \nthe destruction of some significant natural herbal resources with continued use of destructive \nharvest techniques (i.e., seabuckthorn in Durbuljin soum, Zavkhan aimag), low yields in almost \nall animal husbandry and herbal resource sectors, and the general low quality of raw materials \nin the supply chain. To be effective, training for better veterinary or horticultural care will, like \nveterinary services, have to be applied widely and cover many more people than the immediate \nsuppliers to a particular company to ensure that the current situation of extreme variability in \nboth quality and quantity of raw material supply does not continue.  \n \n6.  Rural  Infrastructure.  Companies  plan  to  invest  in  improving  or  developing  rural \ninfrastructure.  Following  the  transition  to  a  market-based  economy,  much  of  the  rural \ninfrastructure including wells, warehouses, sorting sheds, slaughterhouses, and intermediate \nprocessing facilities were abandoned or fell into disrepair as no money was available and, more \nimportantly, no one had responsibility for their upkeep. In responding to this Project, several \ncompanies have prepared plans to improve existing rural infrastructure and facilities or build \nnew  ones  that  will  allow  proper  storage,  preservation,  procurement,  semiprocessing,  and \ntransporting  of  their  raw  or  semiprocessed  materials  more  efficiently  and  with  less  risk  of \ndamage or loss. This focus by companies on the development of rural infrastructure will begin to \nchange the current excessive concentration on Ulaanbaatar\u2019s markets as a source of most raw \nmaterials used by processors. The current situation results from the lack of rural infrastructure \nand facilities for storage, sorting, etc. The result is that people in the countryside are very much \nat the mercy of those with both money and transport, overwhelmingly the large city-based \n\u201cchangers.\u201d The provision of even simple facilities for sorting and grading, pressing and baling, \npreservation, frozen storage of plant resources, and others will make a huge difference to many \nrural residents who will be able to take advantage of these services (and the incentive schemes \ndescribed earlier) to improve their earnings or develop new earning streams.  \n \n7.  Cooperative  Development.  Companies  plan  to  invest  in  development  of  supply \ncooperatives; most companies plan to promote this informally. To solve specific problems in \nparticular subsectors where supply variability is particularly acute, two companies plan to invest \nin assisting the development and maintenance of supply cooperatives. The companies will fund \nset up and provision of offices and basic services such as electricity, computerization, stock and \naccounting systems, and training. When established, the cooperative will be  contracted to \nsupply the company against set quality and quantity criteria. At the same time, the cooperatives \nwill be free to develop additional income streams with other processors using their excess \nproduction and the same office, technology, and techniques provided by the original company \nresponsible for the set up. In addition to these formal plans to establish cooperatives, several of \nthe other companies will encourage suppliers to organize in this way assisted by the incentive \nschemes and/or more formal contracts that they plan to introduce.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  33 \nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND  \nSUPPORT SERVICE INVESTMENTS \n \n1.  Investments. The rural infrastructure and support services development component will \nfinance public investments identified as priorities in the Agriculture Sector Strategy Study and \nthat either have positive impacts on supply chains of project enterprises or the potential to spur \nincreased efficiency of the chains. Investments will focus on three priority areas identified in the \nAgriculture Sector Strategy Study: (i) development of livestock testing and veterinary extension \ncenters, (ii) support to agricultural producer marketing cooperatives, and (iii) development of \nfodder supply and storage. Local participation in the selection of investments will be ensured \nthrough participatory procedures. Where available, the Project will make use of existing herder \ncooperatives, local councils, or other institutions with local participation (e.g., nongovernment \norganizations) to ensure local stakeholder input in identifying investments. The Ministry of Food \nand Agriculture (MoFA) will lead the preparation of subprojects. \n \n2.  Selection  Criteria.  For  interventions  financed  through  the  rural  infrastructure  and \nsupport services development component, proposal selection for financing will be based on the \nfollowing criteria: \n(i)  identified as a priority investment in the Agriculture Sector Strategy; \n(ii)  located  in  geographic  areas  supported  under  the  value-chain  development \ncomponent; \n(iii)  directly  supports  the  supply  chains  developed  under  the  Project  or  has  the \npotential to positively impact the project supply chains; \n(iv)  improves quality and reliability along the supply chain or enhances value addition \nin primary agricultural production; \n(v)  provides benefits to other stakeholders and the community as a whole; able to \naddress the needs and constraints identified by female stakeholders; \n(vi)  provides for greater delivery of public goods (e.g., improve the environment); \n(vii)  has demonstration effects for other supply chains or the community; \n(viii)  provides an economic net present value of 12% or higher based on preliminary \ncost\u2013benefit analysis of the proposed investment; and \n(ix)  is fully compliant with the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in case it is triggered. \n \n3.  The costs for any single investment in a locality will be targeted at $80,000 as a starting \npoint. The maximum investment for any single investment in a locality will be $200,000 without \nspecific authorization to exceed this limit from the project advisory board established to oversee \nimplementation of the project preparatory technical assistance.  \n \n4.  Selection Process. The location, scale, and precise type of infrastructure across the \nfour  types  defined  (paras.  2\u20133)  will  be  determined  in  consultation  with  localities  where \nagribusinesses supported by credit lines under the value-chain development component obtain \nraw material or intermediate inputs. Detailed proposals will be demand driven with subproject \ncomponents identified by stakeholders through herder and farmer cooperatives, local councils, \nand other existing institutions for local participation and representation. The localities will be \nadvised  by  technical  experts  from  MoFA.  MoFA  will  lead  the  technical  preparation  of \nsubprojects through its operating network. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \n5.  The selection procedure for investments under rural infrastructure and support services \ndevelopment component will proceed as follows.  \n \n(i)  The soums or bags (lower jurisdictions) from which the agribusinesses receiving \nlines of credit under component 1 are identified.  \n(ii)  Under the coordination and supervision of a panel of experts convened by MoFA, \nstakeholders from the identified localities (i.e., farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses \nreceiving credit lines under the value-chain development component, and other \nresidents of the locality) discuss investment priorities for the locality across the \nfour broad areas targeted for investments.  \n(iii)  The MoFA panel in cooperation with the concerned locality develops concept \nnotes outlining the infrastructure proposed for development in the locality. The \nconcept notes are made available for review and comment by stakeholders. At \nthe same time, designated staff in the project management unit (PMU) undertake \npreliminary  review  of  the  concept\u2019s  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB \nrequirements,  particularly  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  When \nnecessary,  due  to  the  nature  of  the  infrastructure  proposed,  environmental \nimpact  assessment  reports  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared.  Any \nproposals that appear likely to involve category A environmental impacts will be \nexcluded from further consideration. Any proposals that trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy will be subject to further actions to ensure compliance with \nthe Policy. \n(iv)  Upon clearance of the infrastructure investment proposal from the stakeholder \nand PMU review, a detailed investment proposal is developed that specifies the \nengineering, capital, operating expenses, staffing, and other requirements of the \nproposed infrastructure subproject.  \n(v)  Final detailed subproject proposals undergo a final round of stakeholder review \nand input, and remaining issues regarding the subproject are incorporated into \nthe final design. The subproject is then cleared by MoFA steering panel.  \n(vi)  Funds  are  allocated  to  begin  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed \ninvestment,  and  goods  and  services  required  to  execute  the  subproject  are \nsecured in accordance with ADB and government procurement requirements. \nImplementation of the investment will be in accordance with plans and standard \nsafeguards proceeds as per ADB standards. \n \n6.  Proposals will have to be demand driven. PMU at MoFA will identify aimags (provinces) \nand soums for the rural infrastructure and support services development component based on \nthe approved investment proposals and prepare an information package for dissemination to \nrural communities. The information packages will include data on the overall project objectives, \nexpected outcomes, project implementation procedures and structure, selected enterprises, and \nbasics of bankable proposals. It will include detailed information on the component including \nprocedures for selecting local proposals and implementing, monitoring, and evaluating these \nproposals. PMU will conduct training of trainers for the staff of the aimag agriculture offices to \nensure complete concurrence and standardized local implementation of the component. In turn, \naimag agriculture offices will organize training for local trainers and facilitators for consultations \nand workshops among the local communities in the bags and soums. The local trainers will be \nused  as  agents  for  ensuring  local  input  into  investment  proposal  preparation.  PMU  will \ndisseminate information packages on procedures for the selection of proposals for community-\nbased supply chain infrastructure and support services and call for local proposals. To increase \nexposure of rural communities to the benefits of the component, information dissemination will \nbe organized in selected aimags and soums through (i) official channels of aimag, soum, and \n ", "  Appendix 6  35 \nbag  administrations;  (ii)  local  newspapers,  television,  and  radio;  and  (iii)  nongovernment \norganizations and formal and informal business networks (cooperatives and partnerships). The \nlocal rural communities will prepare investment proposal ideas with the assistance of the local \ntrainers.  Where  available,  the  World  Bank-funded  livelihood  project  councils  or  other  local \norganizations and nongovernment organizations will be responsible for initial screening and \nselection of the proposal ideas to be developed into a community-based supply chain subproject \nproposal. The series of training sessions led by the locally trained trainers and facilitators with a \nparticular focus on project proposal writing will be provided to the communities with the selected \nproposal ideas. The final subproject proposals will be submitted to PMU at MoFA for final \nselection and funding. \n ", " \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n     \n3\nActivities  Indicators and Targets  Responsibility  6\n \n \nA.

(e) Prequalification of contractors shall not be required \nexcept  in  the  case  of  large  or  complex  works  and  with  the  prior  written \nconcurrence of ADB.  \n \n(iii)  Advertising.  Invitations  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  the  Mongolian  national \nlanguage in at least one widely circulated national daily newspaper and freely \naccessible, nationally known website in accordance with Article 21.1 of the Law \non Procurement. Bidding of NCB contracts estimated at (a) $500,000 or more for \ngoods and related services; and (b) $1,000,000 or more for civil works shall be \nadvertised concurrently with the general procurement notices on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n(iv)  Standard bidding document. Standard bidding documents acceptable to ADB \nshall be used. The bidding documents shall provide clear instructions on how \nbids should be submitted, how prices should be offered, and the place and time \nfor submission and opening of bids. Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by \nhand, mail, or courier. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 10 \n(v)  Qualification criteria and evaluation criteria. (a) Qualification criteria shall be \nclearly specified in the bidding documents, and all criteria so specified, shall be \nused to determine whether a bidder is qualified. The evaluation of the bidder\u2019s \nqualifications should be conducted separately from the technical and commercial \nevaluation  of  the  bid.  When  postqualification  is  applied,  the  assessment  of \nbidders' qualifications shall be carried out only after the preliminary and detailed \nevaluation of bids has been completed by the Executing and/or Implementing \nAgency and, in doing so, the qualifications of the bidder who has submitted the \nlowest  evaluated,  substantially  responsive  bid  shall  be  assessed  first.  The \nevaluation of a bidder\u2019s qualifications shall only take into account the bidder\u2019s \ncapacity and resources to perform the contract, in particular, its experience and \npast performance on similar contracts; capabilities with respect to personnel, \nequipment, and construction or manufacturing facilities; and financial position. In \ncarrying out the postqualification assessment, the Executing and/or Implementing \nAgency  shall  exercise  reasonable  judgment  in  requesting,  in  writing,  from  a \nbidder only missing factual or historical supporting information related to the \nbidder's qualifications and shall provide a reasonable time period  (that is, a \nminimum of 7 days) to the bidder to provide a response. (b) Evaluation criteria to \nbe  used  in  the  evaluation  of  bids  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding \ndocuments,  and  evaluation  criteria  other  than  price  shall  be  quantified  in \nmonetary terms. All evaluation criteria so specified shall be taken into account in \nbid evaluation. Merit points shall not be used in bid evaluation.  \n \n(vi)  Bid opening, evaluation, and award of contract. (a) Bids shall be opened in \npublic immediately upon the stipulated deadline for submission of bids. Bidders' \nrepresentatives and project beneficiaries from the concerned local community \nshall be allowed to attend. The name of the bidder and total amount of each bid \nincluding discounts shall be read aloud and recorded in the bid opening record \n(BOR). Bids received after the deadline for bid submission shall be rejected and \nreturned  to  the  bidders  unopened.  Immediately  after  completion  of  the  bid \nopening proceedings, a copy of BOR shall be posted at a prominent location, \naccessible to the public, outside the office of the concerned procuring entity, and \nshall be retained at the same location until the award of contract has been \nnotified. A copy of BOR shall be promptly provided to all bidders who submitted \nbids. (b) All bids shall not be rejected or new bids invited without ADB's prior \nwritten  concurrence.  (c)  No  bid  shall  be  rejected  merely  on  the  basis  of  a \ncomparison with the owner\u2019s estimated cost or budget ceiling without ADB's prior \nwritten concurrence. (d) A bid containing material deviations from or reservations \nto the terms, conditions, or specifications of the bidding documents shall be \nrejected  as  not  substantially  responsive.  A  bidder  shall  not  be  permitted  to \nwithdraw  material  deviations  or  reservations  once  bids  have  been  opened. \nBidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of \nnonmaterial, minor deviations, or reservations. (e) The evaluation of bids shall be \ndone in strict adherence to the criteria specified in the bidding documents, and \ncontracts shall be awarded to the qualified bidder offering the lowest evaluated \nand substantially responsive bid. (f) Bidders shall be requested to extend the \nvalidity of their bids only under exceptional circumstances and, in all such cases, \nthe Executing and/or Implementing Agency shall obtain ADB approval for the \nextension  of  the  bid  validity  period  in  a  timely  manner,  and  subsequently, \ncommunicate such request for extension of the validity period of the bids in \nwriting to all bidders before the date of expiry of their bids. Bidders shall have the \n ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nright to refuse to grant such an extension of the validity of their bids without \nforfeiting their bid securities. Bidders agreeing to extend the validity date of their \nbids shall also extend the validity period of their bid securities. (g) In the case of \ncontracts of more than 18 months\u2019 duration, the bidding documents and the \nresultant  contract  shall  provide  for  price  adjustment  based  on  a  formula \nacceptable  to  ADB  which  shall  be  disclosed  to  the  bidders  in  the  bidding \ndocuments. (h) If a bidder that submitted the lowest evaluated bid refuses to \naccept the arithmetical corrections made by the Executing and/or Implementing \nAgency during the evaluation of its bid, its bid shall be disqualified and its bid \nsecurity shall be forfeited. (i) A bidder shall not be required, as a condition for \naward,  to  undertake  obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  or \notherwise  to  modify  its  bid  as  originally  submitted.  (j)  There  shall  be  no \npostbidding negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder or any other bidder. No \nbidder shall be required, as a condition for the award of contract, to change the \nbid price or otherwise materially alter the bid after it has been submitted. (k) A \nbidder declared ineligible by ADB, based on a determination by ADB that the \nbidder has engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in \ncompeting for or in executing an ADB-financed contract, shall be ineligible to be \nawarded an ADB-financed contract during the period of time determined by ADB. \n \n(vii)  Inspections of accounts and records. Bidding documents and contracts under \nNCB procedures financed by ADB shall include a provision requiring suppliers \nand contractors to permit ADB to inspect their accounts and records relating to \nthe bid submission and the performance of the contract by the supplier and/or \ncontractor, as the case may be, and to have them audited by auditors appointed \nby ADB, if so required by ADB. \n \n(viii)  Complaints by bidders and handling of complaints. Bidders\u2019 complaints shall \nbe handled in accordance with the procedures set out in the Public Procurement \nLaw of Mongolia, chapter 7. \n \n(ix)  Disclosure of decisions on contract awards. At the same time that notification \non award of contract is given to the successful bidder, the results of the bid \nevaluation  shall  be  published  in  a  local  newspaper  or  well-known,  freely \naccessible website identifying the bid and lot numbers and providing information \non (a) name of each bidder who submitted a bid; (b) bid prices as read out at bid \nopening; (c) name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their \nrejection;  and  (d)  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  the  price  it  offered,  and  the \nduration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract  awarded. The  procuring  entity, \nExecuting and/or Implementing Agency shall respond in writing to unsuccessful \nbidders who seek explanations on the grounds on which their bids were not \nselected. \n \n(x)  ADB  member  country  restrictions.

The proposed technical assistance (TA) will be directed to capitalizing on opportunities \nin niche markets to develop a premium brand for Mongolian agriculture products. The brand \ndevelopment will be primarily aimed at developing partnerships between Mongolian enterprises \nand external premium brands to develop a virtual vertically integrated value chain. The long-\nterm ambition could be to provide an opportunity for Mongolian enterprises to develop their own \nindigenous consumer brands for the export market. A number of high-end brands (i) want to \nstay away from price discounted goods, and (ii) would be interested in building the idea of \nMongolia as a premium and/or exclusive product source.1 Enterprises selected for funding \nthrough the Project have inherent elements of performance, process, and origin to varying \ndegrees. The TA will draw on and combine these to provide a platform for creating credible and \ncompelling brands. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n2.  The TA will contribute to realizing the impact of the Project\u2014agriculture and rural growth \nthat sustains premium value differentiation for Mongolian products. The outcome will be the \ncreation of a process for brand development and management that is sustainable and replicable \nby the institutions charged with managing that process, while providing a demonstration effect \nwith two leading enterprises and involving other enterprises in the longer-term process. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n3.  The TA outputs will be a brand framework, content of business proposals, and an \ninstitutional framework for sustained brand management and development including a business \nplan for a brand management agency. \n \nC.  Terms of Reference for Consulting Services \n \n4.  An international branding firm will be recruited through a lump-sum contract.2 Services \nare expected to be provided by a team of two senior consultants supported by a team of up to \nfive junior consultants and researchers altogether providing approximately 40 person-months of \ninputs including 6 person-months in Mongolia. The selection of consultants will follow the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and other arrangements for the recruitment of domestic consultants acceptable to ADB. \n \n5.  The consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n(i)  develop a brand framework; \n(ii)  catalogue the supporting technical issues; \n(iii)  using two enterprises, develop guidelines for enterprises preparing for brand \ndevelopment; \n(iv)  develop the generic material and content for business to business proposals by \nMongolian enterprises; \n                                                 \n1  For example, Loro Piana and Dunhill have developing Mongolia as a premium source of products. Furthermore, \ncompanies such as Burberry and Diesel are known for developing strong links with suppliers to improve their \ninformation technology and production capabilities. \n2  International branding companies do not operate against personnel schedules and specified individual inputs. They \noperate as entities that commit to deliverables. Therefore a lump sum remuneration contract to provide the defined \nTA outputs for the brand development component is proposed as the contracting method for consultants. \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \n(v)  make proposals for two enterprises and develop generic guidelines; \n(vi)  facilitate partnership agreements and use these deals to develop guidelines for \nother enterprises; \n(vii)  facilitate the implementation of the partnership agreements; \n(viii)  help  the  external  enterprises  define  the  brand  based  upon  actual  product \ndevelopment and feed this back into the proposals developed earlier; \n(ix)  provide advice to the partners and their point agencies on the use of the brand; \nand \n(x)  assist in the launch of the product brand. \n \n6.  The consultants will maintain a continuous strand of collated lessons to be used to refine \nthe process for subsequent enterprises and feed it back into the generic process and proposal. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n7.  The estimated TA cost is $2.20 million equivalent, of which $2.00 million equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe cost estimates are in Table A11. \n \nTable A11: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n          Total \nItem     Cost \n     \nA.

Expected Impacts \n1.  The Project will spur growth and increased profitability of Mongolia\u2019s agriculture sector \nthrough  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  leading  Mongolian  agroenterprises  and  by \ndeveloping or upgrading public infrastructure used by primary producers of the raw materials \ndemanded  by  these  agroenterprises.  Infrastructure  is  broadly  defined  to  include  physical \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  technical  assistance  (TA),  support  service,  and  capacity  building. \nHigher growth and profits of agroenterprises will, in turn, enable primary producers (particularly \nlivestock producers) to receive higher prices for their outputs. Through this, poverty will be \nreduced among rural households that depend on agriculture and livestock-raising activities for \ntheir livelihood. High agroenterprise revenues are expected to benefit the economy as a whole \nthrough increased employment and higher wages at agroenterprises.  \n \n2.  Mongolian agriculture has few comparative advantages on international markets based \non price and quality due to its geographic conditions (i.e., mostly semi-arid grasslands with short \ngrowing seasons), low economies of scale, and relatively high transport to most global markets. \nAccordingly, a focus on the few areas of comparative advantage (e.g., extensive livestock \nproduction) and development of market niches is crucial in moving the sector forward. Building \non areas of comparative advantage and development of market niches require investments in \nupgrading  private  enterprises  engaged  in  key  agricultural  supply  chains  and  in  the  public \ninfrastructure that supports primary producers engaged in these supply chains.  \n \n3.  The Project will develop niche markets that provide price premiums for Mongolian agro \nexports through a branding campaign and initiatives to improve the quality and reliability of \nproducts. Credit lines to agroenterprises for value-chain development and investments in public \ninfrastructure  where  enterprises  secure  raw  materials  are  the  principal  mechanisms  for \nachieving these outcomes. Public and private capital needs to be developed to move Mongolian \nagro  industry  forward.  Investments  in  new  physical  and  institutional  infrastructure  are  an \nessential complement to the credit lines provided and the brand development efforts as enabling \npublic  infrastructure  will  create  the  conditions  that  foster  greater  production  efficiency  and \nbenefit sharing by primary agricultural and livestock producers. \n \nB.  Results of Financial and Economic Analysis \n \n4.  The financial and economic analyses are based on separate indicative investments for \nthe value-chain development investments and the grants for supporting public infrastructure. \nEnterprises  with  indicative  investments  under  the  value-chain  development  component \n(component 1) of the Project operate in fruits and berries processing, meat processing, tannery \nand production of leather goods, and herbal medicine. The 15 enterprises targeted for support \ninclude firms producing cashmere and wool, dairy products, and vegetable processing. All these \nenterprises serve both national and export markets. Indicative investments related to the rural \ninfrastructure  and  services  development  component  (component  2)  involve  three  types  of \ninvestments: (i) development of livestock testing and veterinary extension centers, (ii) support to \nagricultural producer (herder) marketing cooperatives, and (iii) development of fodder supply \nand storage. Detailed descriptions are available in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n5.  Because the precise mix and scale of investments in agroenterprises and localities will \nnot be determined until implementation, analyses are carried out only for separate indicative \ninvestments, and no effort is made to try to sum returns across proposed components or to \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \narrive at overall internal rates of return. Furthermore, the long-term benefits of fostering greater \nvalue  addition  in  supply  chains  by  improving  the  business  environment  and  supporting \ninfrastructure for private enterprises in the agriculture sector and developing niche markets for \ntheir products with price premiums cannot be quantified with an adequate degree of precision \nand,  hence,  are  excluded  from  the  analysis.  However,  ample  evidence  indicates  that \ninvestments will improve the quantity and quality of agroprocessed goods produced by the firms \nand through this, generate additional wealth for the economy. In the case of the support to \nlocalities  to  develop  targeted  types  of  infrastructure  related  to  supply  chain  development, \nanalysis faces a similar problem in that final determination of the precise type of infrastructure to \nbe supported will be decided based on the inputs of local communities and technical experts. \nThese characteristics of the Project make assessment of its economic and financial returns \nindicative and problematic to aggregate across investments.  \n \n6.  In accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \nof Projects (1997), the representative subproject analysis is based on the investment budget \nmodel  with  breakdowns  on  revenue  and  cost  by  the  investment  inputs  and  outputs,  and \nprojected cash flows over 20 years. Prices are in 2008 constant year prices assuming an annual \ninflation rate of 6% (the approximate historical average in Mongolia during the past 4 years). \nSensitivity analysis of the risk of a shorter economic life of the Project was completed. All \nexpenditures, revenues, benefits, and costs are incremental and expressed in dollars. The \nexchange rate applied in calculations between foreign and domestic currency relies on the mid-\n2007 exchange of MNT1,165 per $1.00. \n \n7.  The analytical framework relies on the following assumptions and specifications: \n \n(i)  All prices, benefits, and costs were adjusted to early 2008 constant values using \nthe gross domestic product deflator for all local currency benefits and costs, and \nthe G-5 manufacturer\u2019s unit value index for all foreign exchange.  \n(ii)  A discount rate of 12% was used to calculate the net present value and was used \nas a cutoff point for the economic internal rate of return. \n(iii)  Project benefits and costs used in the financial analysis were adjusted to prices \nused in the economic analysis by deducting taxes and duties and by applying \nitem-specific conversion factors (i.e., for items whose economic value differed \nfrom observed market values as in the case of public goods or goods with \nassociated  positive  or  negative  externalities  or  nontraded  goods)  to  local \ncurrency costs. All prices are valued in early 2008 constant prices.  \n \n8.  An  incremental  benefit  analysis  approach  is  applied  to  demonstrate  potential \nimprovements  in  the  performance  of  farming  and  herding  households  and  other  major \nparticipants in the agricultural value chain by determining whether (i) transactions costs are \nreduced in terms of lowered losses due to decline of product quality during processing and \nshipment,  transport  costs  and  delivery  time  required,  and  marketing  costs  associated  with \nmovement  of  goods  from  the  primary  producer  to  final  consumer;  and/or  (ii)  revenues, \nemployment  opportunities,  value  addition  in  product  processing,  and  total  production  are \nincreased  due  to  the  Project.  Quantifiable  benefits  under  the  agroenterprise  credit  line \n(component 1) are likely to accrue from the subprojects financed by the rural infrastructure and \nservices development component (component 2) of the Project, as well as benefits based on \nthe credit line alone. The indicative credit lines and subprojects analyzed are presented in \nTables A12.1 and A12.2. \n \n ", "    Appendix 12       49     \nTable A12.1: Subproject Appraisal Results: Value Chain Development Investments\nIndicative Projected Incremental Cash Flow\nIndicative Project  Capital  FIRR  without  with \nProduct Net \nComponent Investment  (%) Investment Investment\n($ million)\nMeat \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe agriculture sector is important to growth and poverty reduction in Mongolia. Agriculture accounted for 20% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), 40% of employment, 14% of export earnings, and 25% of GDP growth in 2007. Livestock \nproduction, which accounts for 80% of agricultural output, is an important source of income, jobs, food security, and \nsavings for rural households. The country had 40 million head of livestock in 2007, and the number continues to \nincrease with the higher domestic demand for meat and other products of animal origin and increasing demand for raw \nmaterials from the People\u2019s Republic of China. But productivity is low and production risky. Little value is added with less \nthan 10% of production processed beyond the most basic stage. The country mostly exports raw fibers and animal \ncarcasses. Growth has come mostly from higher livestock numbers and brought associated problems of desertification, \npollution, and breed dilution. The results are a stagnant rural economy, low and uncertain rural incomes, and threats to \nthe environment. Market orientation, efficiency, and sustainability of agriculture and rural development are objectives of \nthe country strategy and program.a Coordinated development of agriculture value chains is in line with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) strategy for Mongolia. ADB's strategy targets increased market orientation. The ADB-funded \nAgriculture Sector Development Projectb has laid the foundation for production improvements by building up rural \ninfrastructure and support services, inducing changes in production methods and planning, and changing mindsets of \nproducers from centralist approaches to increased business awareness. However, achievements need to be channeled \ntoward greater market orientation by aligning production with specific supply chains and markets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                            Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.   Key Issues  \nLow agriculture growth will put overall growth at risk. Low and unstable agricultural incomes and limited rural income \nopportunities are a cause of poverty and vulnerability. Agriculture accounts for a fifth of GDP. Agricultural and \nagroprocessed exports account for about a fourth of foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture is the source of employment \nfor almost half of the labor force and the most important source of household income in rural areas. The rural population \ncomprises 43% of Mongolia\u2019s 2.5 million population. In 2003, rural poverty was estimated to be 43%. The natural \ncalamities of 2000\u20132001 demonstrate the vulnerability of the livelihoods of poor herder households to natural shocks. \nVulnerability also manifests in the form of noticeable seasonal consumption variations that reflect agricultural production \ncycles. Agriculture and rural development, therefore, is crucial in broadening and sustaining growth and providing \nopportunities for the poor who have not yet benefited from the transition to a market-based economy. \n \nTwo main groups were identified based on assets and vulnerability: herders and changers; more than 40% are poor. \nHerd size is the major distinguishing factor between the three groups of herders. The bulk of households with 100 or \nfewer head of livestock are poor. Those in the second group, considered middle class, own 100 to 500. Those in the \nthird, wealthy herder households, have more than 500 livestock. The first consists of families that were in poverty \nfollowing the transition and moved to herding because of lack of alternative income opportunities. Most were rural \nnonfarm agricultural workers or industrial or periurban workers. They rear small herds on common areas near urban \nareas, and their stationary herd management is a major source of land degradation. The poor herders do not have basic \ninfrastructure for herding (i.e., fences, winter shelters, wells), their children tend to drop out from school, and they live in \nextended families. The second group has more herding experience but is vulnerable to bad weather and changes in \ndemand. They do not have basic infrastructure for herding (i.e., winter shelters, wells), transportation to move around, \nand equipment for hay making. The third group has access to winter shelters and owns wells and fences; their problems \nare related to limited pasture for herding and limited access to low interest lending. The bulk of agricultural raw materials \nproducers have small herds and have difficulty establishing stable trading relations with changers and processors. \nCollaborative arrangements between these herders could substantially improve their income. For all these groups, \nimproved  marketing  and  distribution,  improved  access  to  market  information,  and  availability  of  risk-sharing \narrangements would provide important income-increasing advantages. The changers are grouped into small, medium, \nand wealthy changers. The small changers are those with a subsistence income, without a source for running a \nbusiness or space for storing cashmere. The medium changers have enough income for living and small savings. They \nbuy cashmere using two sources: (i) their own savings, and (ii) money from wealthy changers. Few of them have their \n ", "    Appendix 13       51     \nown facility to store cashmere. Wealthy changers have their own funding to buy cashmere, their own storage, and \naccess to bank loans. The major portion of the small and medium changers is made up of single women with children. \nThe Project identifies a third special group of families as poor. They originated from workers families of the former state \nfarms and engaged in crop production: wheat, potatoes, or other vegetables. This group is specific to aimags of the \nKhangai region. Many of those families have only subsistence production on small amounts of land and few cows for \nmilking. Although they have more diversified income sources, they still face many constraints such as limited pasture, \nlack of equipment for hay making, and inability to compete with imported crops. Additional income opportunities may be \ncreated for them as some project proposals are targeted with investment to create berry bush plantations in that region. \nEnterprise selection should pay careful attention to proposals of enterprises for developing local basic agriculture raw \nmaterial processing (A Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction [JFPR] project is envisaged with a view to supplement the \nProject by addressing some of the problems of poor herders and changers. Activities may include training for herders \n(setting up groups or cooperatives among herders), mitigation measures for smaller changers including business \nreorientation, and provision of lower interest rate loans to herders and changers. \n \n2.   Design Features \nDuring  project  implementation,  a  participatory  approach  will  be  adopted  to  enable  different  stakeholders  to  be \nrepresented at the project steering committee and other project structures. To increase the exposure of the rural poor \nand vulnerable groups such as women and remote herders to the benefits of the Project, special care will be given to \nenhance their participation through intense dissemination activities and a focused awareness campaign by the project \nmanagement units (PMUs). \nII.   SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project is categorized as category C for involuntary resettlement. It will not require any land acquisition or demolition \nof fixed assets for its implementation. PMUs will monitor investments and, if adverse involuntary resettlement impacts \nare  associated  with  project  investments,  further  disbursements  to  the  enterprise  involved  or  the  relevant  rural \ninfrastructure investment will be subject to compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The Project is \ncategorized as category B for indigenous peoples impact. It will have no adverse impact on indigenous peoples. The \nJFPR project is being designed to address issues related to socially disadvantaged groups, will specifically take into \naccount issues of ethnic minorities and ensure that ethnic minorities benefit from the Project, and will not have any \nadverse impact on them. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \nA participatory process was adopted during project design to understand the needs and constraints of stakeholders. Five \nstakeholder groups were identified and consulted during project preparation. Primary stakeholders include herders and \nchangers; secondary stakeholders include staff from the local governor\u2019s office, representatives of nongovernment \norganizations, and local residents. Consultation consisted of an extensive participatory rural appraisal conducted in \nBayankhongor, Hovd, Selenge, and Sukhbaatar aimags. During each of the field trips, participatory workshops were \norganized to identify stakeholders\u2019 interests, understand linkages between the major project participants, and develop a \nparticipation strategy during project preparation and implementation. \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nWas a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nNo C&P plan was prepared; PMU will develop it with assistance from the social and gender specialist consultant during \nthe first year. \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues \nWomen entrepreneurs are involved in micro agricultural processing, and preparation and trading of agricultural raw \nmaterials. Women experience higher rates of poverty and unemployment in rural areas, and persistent gender wage \ngaps. Their business is usually of an informal nature. Women comprise nearly half of the economically active population, \n54% of those in informal sector, 70% of service providers, 69% of retail traders, and 62% of food manufacturers; and yet \n70% are referred to as unpaid family workers. Only 1/3 of entrepreneurs are female, and the share increases as the size \nof the enterprise decreases. In addition, they are involved in household production which contributed 47% of household \nincome in 2006 (compared to 36.8% in 2003). In cashmere, the only industry studied from a gender perspective, women \nparticipate on a par with men but men dominate in sales. Therefore, rural women constitute a critical target for any \nsustainable  intervention  aimed  at  strengthening  and/or  developing  viable  supply  chains  and  markets.  Promoting \nwomen\u2019s entrepreneurship will contribute to improving raw material quality and certainty of supply, and reduce rural \npoverty, in particular gender income disparities. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \n2.

One \ninternational and two full-time national social development consultants with demonstrated experience in gender and \ndevelopment and women\u2019s economic empowerment will be engaged under the Project. They will work directly with \nPMUs at the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The Project will establish and maintain a sex-\ndisaggregated database and promote annual consultations with relevant stakeholders and local communities to monitor \nits social, gender, participatory, and related impacts. \nIII.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia for the Agriculture Sector Development Project. Manila.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 14       53     \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted taking into consideration the \nnature of the project components and the range of possible specific interventions proposed. Due \nto the potentially extensive and varied scope of the Project, the assessment was not carried out \non  a  specific  site  but  rather  on  the  type  of  intervention,  potential  impacts,  and  broad \ncorresponding mitigation measures. At the time of preparation of the IEE, the individual supply \nchain investment subprojects and rural infrastructure investments of the Project had not been \nselected. Individual sample IEEs of representative value-chain investment plans likely to be \nfinanced under the Project were prepared. The summary IEE and four IEEs of representative \nsubprojects are included as Supplementary Appendix H.   \n \n2.  For  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  environmental  assessment  purposes,  the \noverall Project is categorized as B and the rural investments of the second component as C. \n \nA.  Description of the Project \n3.  The Project has three components: (i) value-chain development, (ii) rural infrastructure \nand  services  development,  and  (iii)  project  management.  Environmental  assessment  was \ncarried out for the first two components. \n \n1.  Component 1: Value-Chain Development  \n4.  This component will develop value chains to deliver premium value products to niche \nmarkets.  A  competitive  process  was  established  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) to select bankable proposals. Through the credit line, funding is expected to be \nprovided to 15 selected agroindustrial enterprises at the top of the supply chain in the wool and \ncashmere, leather, meat, and fruit and herb industries. The selected enterprises will use the \ninvestment to carry out a range of activities that will strengthen the quality and reliability of the \nsupply of inputs to their operations and improve their own production processes. Examples of \nthe bankable proposals of four representative enterprises are presented in Appendix 5 and \nSupplementary Appendix B. The requests for external financing range from $1.45 million to \n$1.71  million  per  enterprise.  The  enterprises  featured  in  Appendix  5  and  Supplementary \nAppendix C record an annual turnover of $1.5 million\u2013$2.0 million and employ between 70 and \n200 people. Based on the proposals of these enterprises, possible project activities include \ninvesting in improved technology processing equipment to produce higher value, purer extracts \nof seabuckthorn; investing in improved genetics; training and increasing sources of supply of \nseabuckthorn; expanding and developing an existing meat processing and canning facility; \nproviding  training  for  herders  and  farmers  in  improved  husbandry,  quality  standards,  and \nveterinary  care;  investing  in  new  or  upgraded  production  facilities  for  leather  processing; \nproviding veterinary services to herders; and improving processing technology for an existing \nherbal medicine business based on the highly valued Mongolian indigenous herbs. \n \n2.  Component 2: Rural Infrastructure and Services Development \n \n5.  Rural infrastructure and services development investments will support the value chains \nof  the  agroenterprises  selected  under  component  1,  and  build  upon  investment  priorities \nidentified in the ADB-funded Agriculture Sector Strategy Study. Infrastructure investments will \nbe targeted to four priority areas identified in the Agriculture Sector Strategy Study and by the \nMinistry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) as being underserved in current government and \ninternational  aid-financed  programs:  (i)  development  of  livestock  testing  and  veterinary \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \nextension  centers,  (ii)  establishment  of  new  wells  and  accompanying  water  management \ninfrastructure, (iii) support to agricultural producer (herder) marketing cooperatives, and (iv) \ndevelopment of fodder supply and storage facilities to foster fodder market development. The \nscope and nature of the indicative investments are based on similar investments undertaken \nunder the ADB-supported Agriculture Sector Development Program. Actual selection of the \ninvestments will be coordinated and supervised by MoFA agriculture and livestock experts and \nthe project working group. Where available, informal herder groups like those established under \nthe Agriculture Sector Development Program, local community councils established under the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Sustainable Livelihoods Project, or other local organizations and nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  used  as  agents  for  local  input  into  investment  selection  and \nimplementation. \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n6.  Physical Resources. Mongolia\u2019s elevated continental position in northern Asia between \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation gives it a climate of warm summers \nand extremely cold winters. Altitude ranges from 518 meters to 4,374 meters. Rainfall is low at \nabout 200 millimeters per year in the capital and less in the south of the country, and falls \nmainly in summer. The country is subject to drought, strong winds, dust storms, and severe \nwinters.  \n \n7.  Soils of the grasslands are fragile with overgrazing and cultivation of unsuitable land \nleading to extensive land degradation due mainly to wind erosion of the valuable topsoil when \nthe protective vegetation cover is reduced. This causes desertification as well as dust and sand \nstorms. Mongolia is well endowed with minerals which are the country\u2019s main export.  \n \n8.  The failure of many wells in grazing areas has led to the reduction in the area available \nfor grazing and intensification of grazing with consequent increased land degradation on many \nareas  with  a  water  supply.  The  Tuul  River  at  Ulaanbaatar  is  heavily  polluted  by  existing \nindustries and urban wastewater with inadequate treatment in industrial wastewater treatment \nplants  and  the  city  central  wastewater  treatment  plant.  The  leather  processing  industry  is \nidentified as a problem because of the discharge of waste chromium used in tanning processes.  \n \n9.  Ecological Resources. The country is on an elevated plateau mainly of undulating \ngrasslands  with  some  forests  and  mountains.  The  grasslands  are  extensively  grazed  by \ndomestic animals where water is available. Mongolia has a wide variety of wildlife species, and \nfishes are abundant in rivers and lakes. The country has more than 10 million hectares of forest \nor about 7% of the country area; this is currently subject to over-exploitation and fire damage. \nMore than 20 million hectares or over 13% of the country are in protected areas. \n \nC.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n10.  The Project is expected to result in an overall increase in efficiency, productivity, and \nprofitability  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  raise  the  economic  return  in  the  sector  through \nimproved quality and access to markets. Environmental and health benefits will accrue from \nimproving practices and equipment, including reduced waste, and moving to safer usage of \nchemicals and other inputs. In addition, the technical assistance (TA) will be provided to create \npremium  value  differentiation  of  agriculture  products.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be  brand \nawareness among key stakeholders through a brand development initiative. The TA will first \nidentify a premium brand image for Mongolian agriculture and, on the basis of this brand image, \nprovide expert advice to agricultural enterprises and participants in value chains on investments \n ", "    Appendix 14       55     \nto  realize  the  premium  value.  Brand  development  will  provide  a  market  incentive  for  the \nagricultural industry to progress to a more sustainable basis. \n \n1.  Component 1: Value-Chain Development \n11.  The Project will strengthen the supply chains in four subsectors: leather, wool and \ncashmere, meat, and fruits and herbs. Bankable proposals were prepared for four subprojects; \nthese are the most advanced in their planning and most likely to be funded under the Project. \nEnvironmental assessments were completed for these as representative proposals. Individual \nIEE reports are attached to the summary IEE in Supplementary Appendix H. They include \ndetailed tables identifying potential environmental impacts for each subproject activity, and \nrequired  mitigation  and  enhancement  measures.  The  four  proposals  are  Mongol  Shevro \n(leather), Khatan Suikh Impex (meat), Monos Pharma (pharmaceutical factory and plantation), \nand Uvs Khuns (seabuckthorn plantation and processing). A summary of the specific potential \nenvironmental impacts based on the four IEEs follows. \n \n12.  Leather  Subsector.  The  leather  factory  has  existing  pollution  issues  relating  to \nwastewater containing chromium and other contaminants. Increased pollution as a result of \nincreased production is partially offset in the proposal by equipment upgrades to reduce water \nand chemical use per unit of production. Mitigation measures are proposed to reduce pollution \nby at least the same amount as the additional pollution caused by the increased production. \nThis is to be achieved by requiring a specialist cleaner production assessment as part of the \ndetailed design and equipment selection. The supply chain activities may encourage herders to \nincrease  their  herd  size,  thus,  adding  to  the  existing  unsustainable  pasture  use  and  land \ndegradation. As a mitigation measure for this, the training and awareness-raising proposed by \nthe company to undertake with herders will include awareness of the benefits of maintaining a \nsmaller healthier herd and improving returns by focusing on quality, not quantity. \n \n13.  Meat Subsector. No significant negative impact is identified as a result of increased \nproduction as the process is relatively benign producing little solid waste and wastewater which \nis disposed of to the sewerage system after pretreatment to reduce fat and oil content. The \nnumber of livestock around the aimag centers will increase with corresponding land degradation \nand waste issues. However, this will be more than offset by the benefits of reduced livestock \nnumbers in the Ulaanbaatar area. \n \n14.  Pharmaceutical Subsector. The proposed factory is expected to have little significant \nenvironmental impact. This is due to the location of the plant in an area adjacent to existing \nindustry with no vegetation or habitat conservation issues, the relatively small scale of the \noperation, and the low amount of waste produced. The plant will be a small modern facility \ndesigned and operated to a high degree of cleanliness required by good manufacturing practice \nstandards.  This  will  be  complemented  by  consultancy  and  training  for  establishing  good \nmanagement practices and quality management systems in accordance with World Health \nOrganization standards. The impact of the proposed plantation cannot be fully assessed at this \nstage as the sites have not been selected. However, an analysis is presented of the typical \nimpacts  to  be  expected  together  with  exclusion  criteria  for  site  selection  to  ensure  that \nenvironmentally sensitive areas are avoided and suitable mitigation measures incorporated. Site \nselection and development should follow these criteria and mitigation measures.  \n \n15.  Seabuckthorn Plantation and Processing. The proposed factory upgrade is expected \nto have little significant environmental impact. The plant will be a small modern facility designed \nand operated to the high standard of cleanliness required for the target market. The impact of \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \nthe proposed plantation area is expected to be low as (i) this was the site of a former irrigation \narea with water supply infrastructure already in place, (ii) water use will be a small proportion of \nthe  available  resource,  (iii)  the  area  has  little  existing  vegetation,  (iv)  no  environmentally \nsensitive areas will be affected, (v) the site is well drained, (vi) no chemicals are to be used, and \n(vii) little waste will be produced. With the incorporation of mitigation measures based on \ngeneral good practice, no significant or unacceptable environmental impacts are anticipated. \nFor all subprojects under this component, Government approval is required through the Ministry \nof Nature and Environment (MNE) before the project proceeds. Khan Bank will ensure that \nrequired approvals are in place before issuing the loan. The environment specialist within the \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  actions  and  mitigation \nmeasures are implemented, review the process to ensure that government processes have \noperated correctly, and monitor project performance throughout implementation.  \n2.  Component 2: Rural Infrastructure and Services Development \n16.  The  environmental  assessment  of  this  component  is  based  on  a  review  of  similar \ninfrastructure investments carried out under the Agriculture Sector Development Program and a \nreview of potential sites for project investments. The scale and nature of activities in the rural \ninfrastructure and services development component are such that no significant environmental \nimpact  is  expected;  this  component  is  categorized  as  C  under  the  ADB  environmental \nassessment criteria. \n17.  During  project  implementation,  PMU  environment  specialist  will  review  the  selected \ninvestments to ensure that they do not differ significantly from those anticipated during the \nproject preparatory TA in terms of type, scale, and environmental sensitivity of location. In \naddition, PMU will be guided by an exclusion list that states that project activities not be located \nin environmentally sensitive locations including protected areas or their buffer zones; or cultural \nheritage sites, wetlands, sensitive habitats, or areas with significant biodiversity. The Project will \nnot fund (i) major civil works including major earthworks, dams, irrigation or drainage works;  \n(ii) major land clearance; (iii) activities producing significant liquid, gaseous, or solid wastes;  \n(iv) activities involving displacement or relocation of people or effects on livelihoods, influx of \nworkers,  intensification  of  land  use  with  significant  environmental  degradation,  roads,  or \nsignificant heavy vehicle traffic, forestry or extractive industry (quarries); or (v) any activities that \nwould warrant classification as category A or B under ADB environmental requirements.  \n18.  The summary of impacts and mitigation measures proposed is as follows: \n \n(i)  Develop livestock testing and veterinary extension centers. The program will \nhave a generally positive benefit in improving the health of livestock and quality \nof animal products. Improved animal health will result in improved resource use \nefficiency in terms of the amount of land, feed, and other inputs required per unit \nof  product  with  corresponding  reduction  in  land  degradation.  Improving  the \nquality  of  skins  and  fibers  will  result  in  reduced  wastage  due  to  damaged \nmaterials. Some potential for minor impacts is associated with disposal of waste. \nAs a safeguard measure, training will be provided on safe handling of supplies \nand waste disposal. Veterinary laboratories will be required to have a specialist \nincinerator meeting international standards for veterinary medical waste. \n \n(ii)  Support herder marketing cooperatives. Due largely to their small scale and \nspread over the project areas, none of these investments is expected to have \nany significant negative environmental impact. A positive benefit will be improved \n ", "    Appendix 14       57     \nability of herders to add value and improve the quality of their produce, improve \ntheir  linkage  to  the  market,  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  production.  By \nincreasing the return to herders per animal, these activities will reduce the need \nfor herders to simply maximize their herd size, thus, contributing to improved \nsustainability. It will provide support to herders located in more remote parts of \nthe country reducing the incentive for a larger number of animals to be located \nnear the main centers, and reducing this current source of land degradation in \nthese  areas.  Waste  from  veterinary  supplies  will  be  returned  to  the  aimag \nveterinary  center,  if  possible,  for  disposal  in  a  purpose  built  incinerator  in \ncoordination with the veterinary centers subcomponent. \n(iii)  Develop  fodder  supply  and  storage  facilities  to  foster  fodder  market \ndevelopment.  Given  the  scale  and  nature  of  these  activities,  no  significant \nnegative  environmental  impact  is  expected.  Fodder  production  will  reduce \npressure on grazing land by providing secure feed for winter and spring when \nfeed is most scarce. Construction activity is budgeted at $92,000 which, when \nspread across the project areas, will only be for minor building works from which \nno significant environmental impacts are expected. Cultivation, if any, should be \non a small scale but still may result in soil erosion. As a safeguard for this, \ncultivation will be planned on land with soil of low erosion potential, and employ \nsoil conservation techniques including minimum tillage cultivation techniques. \nSites selected for cultivation will be flat with established wind breaks against \nprevailing winds; they will not be located adjacent to waterways. These aspects \nwill  be  included  in  a  training  program  together  with  safe  use  of  fertilizers; \nherbicides; and pesticides, if these are used. \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n19.  As the selection of individual subprojects to be financed under components 1 and 2 is \nnot yet finalized, appropriate procedures and capacity must be in place to ensure that ADB \nenvironmental requirements are met during implementation. \n \n20.  The institutional and monitoring arrangements for the environmental aspects will be \nintegrated  with  that  for  implementation  of  the  entire  Project.  A  separate  PMU  is  to  be \nestablished  for  each  of  the  value-chain  development  and  rural  infrastructure  and  services \ndevelopment  components  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MoFA.  A  national  environment \nspecialist  will  be  appointed  to  PMUs  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  environmental \nrequirements as part of project monitoring and evaluation. Additional local specialists should be \ninvolved  in  developing  training  and  extension  programs  such  as  in  sustainable  pasture \nmanagement, industrial pollution control, and cleaner production. An international environment \nspecialist could be involved for a few weeks per year to provide guidance in establishing the \nProject and conducting regular reviews. \n \n1.  Component 1: Value-Chain Development \n21.  The  following  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  for  environmental \nassessment and approval of subprojects under the value-chain development component is \nbased on MNE procedures and ADB guidelines: \n \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n(i)  The advisory board selects investment proposals. \n(ii)  Selected companies are advised of the process including the requirement to \ncomply with government and ADB requirements. \n(iii)  PMU  environment  specialist  categorizes  the  selected  proposals  according  to \nADB environmental requirements and provides recommendations to ADB for \ndecision: (a) category A activities will not be funded, (b) category B activities will \nrequire  environmental  assessment  in  accordance  with  ADB  (IEE)  and \ngovernment requirements, and (c) category C activities will require no further \nenvironmental  assessment  under  ADB  requirements  (but  may  still  require \nassessment under government requirements).  \n(iv)  Companies refer their proposals to MNE for initial assessment in parallel with \npreparing a detailed proposal. The MNE process is as follows: (a) An MNE \nexpert carries out initial assessment and makes a recommendation to the MNE \ncommittee to be completed within 12 days. (b) The MNE committee determines \nwhether (1) no further assessment is needed but may impose conditions, or (2) \ndetailed  environmental  assessment  is  needed.  (c)  If  detailed  environmental \nassessment is needed, then the company arranges for this to be carried out by a \nconsultant  licensed  for  this.  (d)  MNE  reviews  the  detailed  environmental \nassessment and may request further information. (e) MNE approves with or \nwithout conditions, or rejects. \n(v)  PMU environment specialist refers the subproject to ADB for review and approval \nat  the  following  points  together  with  recommendations:  \n(a) categorization according to ADB environmental requirements, (b) MNE initial \nassessment, (c) detailed environmental assessment, and (d) MNE approval. \n(vi)  The commercial bank confirms that approvals are in place and that PMU has no \nobjection before granting the loan. \n \n22.  During  implementation,  companies  should  monitor  and  regularly  report  on  the \nimplementation of environmental requirements and outcomes as part of the overall reporting to \nKhan Bank and ADB. The companies will be required to report any environmental incidents, \naccidents, complaints, litigation, regulatory notices, or fines in their operation to PMU, Khan \nBank, and MNE as soon as possible. Corrective actions will be developed and agreed upon \nbetween the company and State Specialized Inspection Agency or other applicable agency. \nThis will be referred to PMU environment specialist and Khan Bank for review and concurrence. \nKhan Bank will report any environmental incidents that it becomes aware of to PMU and a \nsimilar  procedure  initiated.  The  environment  specialist  within  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing and reviewing this monitoring to ensure that it is satisfactorily carried out. \n2.  Component 2: Rural Infrastructure and Services Development \n23.  These  investments  are  confirmed  as  category  C;  therefore  no  formal  procedure  of \napproval is needed. However, the environment specialist within PMU will be responsible for \noverseeing and reviewing the component to ensure that it is satisfactorily carried out with no \nsignificant deviations from the original scope and nature of investments, and that the exclusion \nlist is respected. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n24.  Major project-related documents have been accessible through the website of ADB\u2019s \nMongolia Resident Mission in both English and Mongolian through out the project preparatory \nTA.
