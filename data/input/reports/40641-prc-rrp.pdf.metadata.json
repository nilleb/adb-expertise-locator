An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  and  uploaded  to  the  ADB  website  on  2  December \n2008. \n \nThe  proposed  Hebei  Small  Cities  and  Towns  Development \nDemonstration  Sector  Project  (the  Project)  will  enable  improved \nurban  infrastructure  delivery  by  implementing  environmentally \nsustainable  subprojects  in  selected  small  cities  and  towns  in \nHebei Province. The Project is being processed as a sector loan \nto allow the Hebei provincial government (HPG) to respond to the \nrapidly  changing  needs  of  cities  and  towns  across  the  province. \nThe  Project  includes  about  10  subproject  small  cities  and  towns. \nDetailed assessment and analyses have been undertaken for the \nthree  core  subprojects:  Bazhou  City,  Zhaoxian  County,  and \nZhengding County. Subsequent subprojects will be prepared and \nappraised  during  project  implementation  following  an  agreed  set \nof criteria and procedures. The Bazhou subproject includes (i) the \nMangniu  River  improvement  and  sewer  network  rehabilitation \ncomponent,  which  will  improve  river  water  quality  and  flood \ncontrol, reduce groundwater pollution, and support the integration \nthe \nof  environmental \nShengfang  town  water  supply  component,  which  will  improve \nwater  supply  reliability  and  quality  and  reduce  the  number  of \nshallow  groundwater  wells.  The  Zhaoxian  subproject  has  three \ncomponents: (i) wastewater treatment, (ii) heating supply, and (iii) \nsolid  waste  management.  These  components  will  improve  urban \nenvironmental quality by reducing air, water, and land pollution. In \nZhengding,  the  solid  waste  management  component  will  provide \ntransfer  points  and  a \nconveniently \nprocessing  facility  for  recyclables  and  composting  for  producing \nliving \nnatural \n\nfertilizer.  This  component  will \n\nlocated  collection  and \n\nimprovements;  and \n\ninfrastructure \n\nimprove \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\n\fii \n\n \nRationale \n\nenvironment  and  enhance  tourism,  as  Zhengding  has  a  rich \ncultural  heritage.  All  components  address  basic  urban \ninfrastructure  to  support  the  expansion  of small  cities  and  towns, \nenhance  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment,  and  attract  rural \nmigrants to work in light industry and the service sector.  \n \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  is  committed  to  developing  small \ncities  and  towns  as  a  way  to  foster  economic  growth,  generate \nemployment, and narrow the rural\u2013urban income gap. The growth \nof  small  cities  and  towns  creates  economic  opportunities  for  the \nrural  poor,  who  are  attracted  to  alternative  incomes  in  urban \nareas.  This  is  the  key  to  realizing  the  PRC\u2019s  vision  of  a \n\u201charmonious  society,\u201d  in  which  the  benefits  of  economic  growth \nare shared more equitably.  \n \nThe PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) 2006\u20132010 identifies small \ncity  and  town  development  as  a  means  to  provide  a  higher \nstandard of living to rural migrants through improved basic urban \ninfrastructure  services.  Building  on  the  conclusions  of  the  2004 \nADB-financed  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy  Study, \nthe \nnational town development policy calls for strengthening physical \nand economic linkages between major cities in metropolitan areas \nor  development  corridors  and  the  smaller  settlements  at  their \nperiphery. \n \nHebei\u2019s  industrial  structure  is  dominated  by  traditional  capital-\nintensive  resource-processing  industries  that  are  state  owned, \ngenerate  limited  employment,  and  are  heavy  polluters.  It  has \nlimited \nremained  a \neconomic,  social,  technological,  or  political  linkages  with  Beijing \nand Tianjin, despite proximity to these major cities. Hebei suffers \nfrom  undeveloped  urban\u2013rural  linkages,  underinvestment,  weak \nurban  management,  and  significant  deterioration  of  the  natural \nenvironment,  including  the  depletion  of  water  resources.  The \nchallenge  is  to  improve  infrastructure  service  delivery,  safeguard \nthe  environment,  and  improve  local  living  conditions  to  achieve \nsustainable  development  that  balances  economic  growth,  social \nadvancement,  and  environmental  recovery.  Addressing  these \nchallenges  will  require  integrated  and  coordinated  policy  and \ninfrastructure interventions in various sectors.  \n \nHebei\u2019s Social and Economic Development 11th FYP 2006\u20132010 \ncalls  for  developing  a  more  balanced  urban  system  through  the \ngrowth of medium-sized cities that can serve as economic centers \nfor  surrounding  towns. County-level  cities  and  towns,  in  turn,  are \nexpected  to  enhance  their  economic  integration  with  rural  areas \nthat  depend  primarily  on  agriculture.  In  this  respect,  town  and \ncounty-level city development contributes directly to the provincial \nobjective  of  promoting  integrated  rural  and  urban  development. \nThe  main  constraint  on  town  development  is  inadequate  urban \nthe  Hebei  Urban \ninfrastructure  and  services,  according \n\nlargely  underdeveloped  province,  with \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii \n\nto \n\nto  mitigate \n\nthe  environmental \n\ntown  development  challenge \n\nConstruction 11th FYP 2006\u20132010. Towns need more reliable and \nsustainable  water  supply  and  energy  services  to  attract  private \nsector  investments  that  can  create  jobs  and  attract  migrants.  At \nthe  same  time,  improved  wastewater  and  solid  waste  disposal  is \nimpacts  of  rapid \nnecessary \neconomic growth and improve living conditions for local residents. \nHebei\u2019s \ntherefore  combines \npromoting economic growth with improving the urban environment \nand urban management and governance capacity.  \n \nTo help small cities and towns fulfill their economic potential and \nenable  a  more  harmonious  form  of  development,  the  Project  will \nfacilitate the delivery of improved environmental infrastructure and \nmunicipal  services  to  (i)  attract  investment,  especially  in  labor-\nintensive  industries  and  services;  (ii)  provide  a  decent  urban \nenvironment \nresidents  by  substituting  energy-efficient \ncentralized  heating  for  household  coal  burning,  collecting  and \ntreating  wastewater  before  discharge  into  the  environment,  and \nintroducing sanitary practices and recovery of recyclables in solid \nwaste  management;  (iii)  strengthen  urban  management  capacity \nin  planning,  implementation,  and  operation;  and  (iv)  extend  the \nbenefits of growth to all residents by improving the coverage and \nquality  of  basic  municipal  services  to  households  across  the \nsocioeconomic  spectrum.  The  Project  directly  contributes  to  the \ncontinuing efforts of HPG to support socioeconomic development \nthat  balances  economic  growth,  social  advancement,  and \nenvironmental recovery in the context of sustainable development. \n \nThe impact of the Project is an improved urban environment and \nimproved  public  health  and  quality  of  life  for  residents  of  small \ncities and towns in Hebei Province. The outcome of the Project is \nimproved urban infrastructure and municipal services in about 10 \nsmall cities and towns in Hebei Province. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $235.9 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $22.2 million. \n \n\nSource \nADB \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund under the Water \n\nFinancing Partnership Facilitya \n\nBazhou County Government \nZhaoxian County Government \nZhengding County Government \nOther County Governments \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent) \n\n100.0 \n0.3 \n\n17.2 \n22.6 \n10.0 \n85.8 \n235.9b \n\na  Contributors:  the  governments  of  Australia,  Austria,  Norway,  and  Spain,  and \n\nadministered by ADB.

The Hebei project management \noffice  (PMO)  was  established  in  the  Hebei  Finance  Bureau  to \nundertake and manage day-to-day project activities, including the \nselection  and  appraisal  of  subsequent  subprojects.  In  each \nsubproject  city  and  town,  a  PLG  and  PMO  were  set  up  to  liaise \nwith the Hebei PMO and the departments and bureaus concerned \nand  to  oversee,  manage,  and  coordinate  the  infrastructure \ninvestments undertaken by project implementing agencies. \n \nHebei Provincial Government \n \nGoods,  works,  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \nInternational  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive \nbidding,  or  shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  procurement \ndepending on the circumstances of each contract package. \n \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nv \n\nliving  conditions \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  for  international  and  national \nconsulting  services  to  support  the  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies  in  project  implementation  and  management  and  for \ninstitutional  capacity  development.  Consultants  will  be  recruited \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction, directly benefiting \n1.2  million  people  in  Hebei  Province,  9.6%  of  the  residents  of \nwhich are rural poor, compared with the national average of 5.9%. \nPoor  communities  will  have  access  to  safe  and  reliable  water \nsupply,  better  urban  services,  and  improved  living  conditions.  All \nresidents  in  the  10  subproject  small  cities  and  towns  will  benefit \nindirectly,  with \nimproving  as  a  result  of \n(i) improved water quality and quantity; (ii) reduced use of polluted \nwater sources; (iii) reduced incidence of waterborne diseases and \nthe resulting reduction in medical costs; and (iv) reduced pollution \nloads  on  air,  water,  and  land  following  improved  wastewater \ntreatment; wastewater reuse; energy-efficient centralized heating; \nand  solid  waste  treatment,  recycling,  and  composting.  Water \nsupply, wastewater, heating, solid waste, and river improvements \nwill stimulate investments in industry, resource extraction, and the \nservice  sector,  including  tourism,  directly  and  indirectly  creating \njobs  for  existing  residents  and  new  migrants  to  small  cities  and \nthe  core \ntowns.  During \nsubprojects  alone,  1,585  new  jobs  will  be  created.  Follow-on \nmultiplier  effects  are  expected  to  create  indirectly  an  additional \n2,536 jobs. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce \nincidence  of  waterborne  and \nrespiratory  diseases.  Investments  in  improved  water  supply  and \nwastewater  facilities  in  Bazhou  County,  Zhaoxian  County,  and \nabout  10  other  counties  in  Hebei  are  anticipated  to  reduce \nhousehold  medical  expenses  related  to  waterborne  diseases  by \nCNY75.6  million  in  2012\u20132020.  In  addition,  the  incidence  of \nrespiratory  disease  is  expected  to  drop.  Heating  investments  will \nreplace  small,  inefficient  boilers  and  highly  polluting  coal-burning \nstoves,  thus  reducing  the  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  and \nimproving local air quality and respiratory health. The Project will \nhave positive effects on climate change, supporting PRC and ADB \nclimate  change  initiatives  and  ADB\u2019s  broader  Clean  Energy  and \nEnvironment  Program  (2008)  by  enhancing  water  resource \nmanagement,  secondary  wastewater  treatment,  district  heating, \nand solid waste management and treatment. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  climate  change  adaptation  through \nmeasures to improve flood control and strengthen water resources \nmanagement  in  the  subproject  cities  and  towns  that  are  prone  to \nincreasing floods and droughts. \n \n \n\nthe  construction  and  operation  of \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nimplementation, \n\ninstitutional  strengthening \n\ntechnical  risks. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual \nConventional engineering designs with proven records of reliable \nperformance  will  be  adopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, solid waste management, district heating, and river \nimprovement.  Mitigating  measures  will  be  put  in  place  during \ndetailed  design  to  address  any  technical  risks  associated  with \nimprovement  works.  During \nthe  project \nimplementation  consultant  will  support \nthe  PMOs  and \nimplementing  agencies  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  works \ncomply with design requirements and quality assurances. \n \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation,  economic \nviability,  and  the  realization  of  project  benefits:  (i)  failure  to \nimplement \nfor  effective  project \nimplementation  and  management  and  corporate  governance;  (ii) \nlack of proper operation and maintenance of project facilities; (iii) \nmajor  amendments  and  changes  to  the  master  plans  in  the \nsubproject  cities  and  towns;  (iv)  delay  in  the  provision  of \ncounterpart funding; (v) failure to establish or increase water and \nwastewater \ntargets;  and  (vi) \nto  meet  cost-recovery \nunforeseen  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues  that  could \nconstrain  the  efficient  implementation  of  project  works  or  the \nrestoration of livelihoods of affected people. \n \nRisks (i) and (ii) will be mitigated by providing institutional capacity \ndevelopment \ntown  PMOs  and \nimplementing agencies on project implementation and operations \nand  the  maintenance  requirements  of  project  facilities,  with  the \nsupport of the loan implementation consultant and related training. \nIn addition, the PLG will provide oversight and timely guidance to \nmitigate  project  management  risk.

The design and monitoring framework of the Project \nis in Appendix 1. The problems and objectives tree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nThe  scale  of  urbanization  in  the  PRC  is  unprecedented.  About  12  million  rural  people  will \nmigrate annually to urban areas over 2000\u20132020. Since 1980 the urban population of the PRC has \nmore than tripled, reaching 577 million in 2006. The urban population comprises 45% of the total \npopulation and is expected to exceed 50% by 2015. The PRC\u2019s 660 cities cannot absorb all these \nmigrants  because  rapid  urban  growth  already  strains  their  infrastructure.  Small  cities  and  towns \nmust develop urban infrastructure facilities and services to facilitate the growth of  secondary and \ntertiary employment and enable migration from rural areas. The PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) \n2006\u20132010  posits  small  city  and  town  development  as  a  means  to  provide  a  higher  standard  of \nliving to rural migrants without exacerbating the infrastructure and environmental problems afflicting \nlarge  cities.  Building  on  the  conclusions  of  the  ADB-financed  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy \nStudy,2 PRC  town  development  policy  calls  for  strengthening  linkages  between  major  cities  and \nsmaller cities and towns at their periphery. The  Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy and \nwill help the PRC achieve Millennium Development Goal 7, target 7.C, which establishes the 2015 \ntarget  of  halving  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nimproved sanitation. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC to make \nmarkets  work  more  efficiently  through  infrastructure  development  and  to  promote  environmental \nsustainability.  By  supporting  sustainable  development  integrating  urban  and  rural  areas,  the \nproposed  Project  supports  ADB's  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)3 and \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  (2008\u20132010) 4  by  promoting  efficient  infrastructure, \nstrengthening  environmental  management,  and  supporting \ninclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment  to  help  the  Government  build  a  xiaokang  (moderately  well-off)  society.  The  Project \nwill develop markets and create jobs by supporting urbanization and improving investment potential \nin towns, while protecting the environment. \n \n4. \nMany  cities  and  towns  have  made  significant  investments  in  urban  infrastructure,  but  few \nlocal  governments  have  developed  an  integrated  approach  to  urban  development  that  combines \ninfrastructure  improvements  with  demand-driven,  pro-poor  development  and  appropriate  urban \ndesign.  Demand-side  management,  based  on  determining  the  preferences  of  end  users  and \nincorporating them into project design, is not widely practiced. \n\n                                                 \n1   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n2   ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n \n5. \nImproved  environmental  management  in  small  cities  and  towns  is  an  ongoing  trend  in \ngovernment  policy,  which  emphasizes  environmental  sustainability  in  urban  development. \nConsistent with national policy, in January 2008 the Ministry of Environmental Protection (then the \nState  Environmental  Protection  Administration)  announced  revised  criteria  for  ecologically  sound \nprovinces,  cities,  and  counties  that  balance  environmental  protection  objectives  with  economic \ngrowth goals. The Chinese Public\u2019s Environment and Inhabitant Livelihood Index 2007 reports that \n26% of Chinese people are very concerned with air quality.5 Awareness is growing of the adverse \neffects of the PRC\u2019s unprecedented industrialization, which contributes to the country\u2019s ranking as \nthe  world\u2019s  biggest  emitter  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  Government  intends  to  manage  natural \nresources effectively and mitigate climate change in ways that will alleviate the adverse impacts of \nrapid economic growth on livelihoods and ecological diversity. \n \n6. \nLocated in northern PRC, Hebei Province has an area of 187,700 square kilometers and a \npopulation of 69.4 million, of which 38% lived in urban areas in 2006. Hebei\u2019s economy is dynamic \nand  diverse,  spanning  heavy  industry  (construction  materials,  pharmaceuticals,  and  steel \nproduction),  light  industry  (textiles  and  agroprocessing),  and  resource  extraction  (coal).  Hebei\u2019s \nindustrial structure is dominated by traditional capital-intensive resource-processing industries that \nare state owned, generate limited employment, and are heavy polluters. It has remained a largely \nunderdeveloped  province,  with  limited  economic,  social,  technological,  and  political  linkages  with \nBeijing and Tianjin, despite proximity to these major cities. Hebei suffers undeveloped urban\u2013rural \nlinkages,  underinvestment,  weak  urban  management,  and  significant  deterioration  in  the  natural \nenvironment, including the depletion of water resources. The challenge is to improve infrastructure \nservice  delivery,  safeguard  the  environment,  and  improve  local  living  conditions  to  achieve \nsustainable development that balances economic growth, social advancement, and environmental \nimprovement.  Addressing  these  challenges  will  require  integrated  and  coordinated  policy  and \ninfrastructure interventions in various sectors.6 \n \n7. \nHebei\u2019s policy on the development of its small cities and towns mirrors the national policy. \nHebei\u2019s  Social  and  Economic  Development  11th  FYP  calls  for  a  more  balanced  urban  system \nthrough  the  growth  of  medium-sized  cities  that  can  serve  as  economic  centers  for  surrounding \ntowns. Through targeted urbanization, medium-sized cities will increase their economic weight and \ndevelop  upstream  economic  linkages  with  smaller  cities  and  towns  in  their  hinterlands. 7 County-\nlevel cities and towns, in turn, are expected to enhance their economic relationship with rural areas \nthat  depend  primarily  on  agriculture.  In  this  respect,  town  and  county-level  city  development \ncontributes directly to the provincial objective of promoting integrated rural and urban development.  \n \nThe  Hebei  Urbanization  11th  FYP  identified  a  major  urban  development  axis  linking  the \n8. \nprovincial capital of Shijiazhuang to the northeast with the Tangshan, Handan, and Baoding growth \npoles.  To  promote  quality  standards  in  urban  services,  the  Hebei  Urban  Construction  11th  FYP \nemphasizes  the  need  for  more  efficient  delivery  of  urban  services.  Ranked  11th  among \n31 provinces in gross domestic product per capita, Hebei faces a challenge to develop small cities \nand towns in a way that combines county-level city development with the promotion of economic \ndevelopment and environmental sustainability.  \n \nThe Project will promote the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of small city \n9. \nand \ninfrastructure  and  municipal  services.  The \nimprovements  will  (i)  attract  economic  investment,  especially  in  labor-intensive  industries  and \n                                                 \n5   Released by the China Environmental Culture Promotion Association in January 2008. \n6   ADB.  2004.

The aim is to promote the development of selected small cities and \ntowns  in  the  provinces  of  Hebei,  Liaoning,  and  Shanxi  in  a  way  that  can  be  replicated  in  other \ntowns in these provinces and elsewhere in the PRC. The three provinces were selected following \nthe successful outcome of two ADB-financed technical assistance (TA) projects: the Town-Based \nUrbanization  and  Strategy  Study  (footnote  2)  and  the  Hebei  Provincial  Development  Strategy.8  \nWhile small cities and towns in these provinces face many similar problems and challenges, they \nare  different  in  terms  of  their  location  and  economy  in  ways  that  offer  unique  opportunities  for \npromoting  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  Appendix  2  provides  a  sector  and  subsector \nanalysis. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProject Background. Hebei\u2019s 69.4 million people are relatively poor, as the provincial rural \n11. \npoverty rate of 9.6% is higher than the national rate of 5.9%. Growth is uneven, with small cities \nand towns growing at an average annual rate of 2%, or just a tenth of the 20% growth rate of large \nand medium-sized cities. Income disparity is apparent, with rural income per capita at CNY3,482, \nor little more than a third of the urban per capita income of CNY9,107. Some small cities have been \nsuccessful in promoting tourism and capturing multiplier effects in the service sector, and resource-\nendowed towns have taken advantage of the growth of the mining, metals, and energy sectors. On \nthe  supply  side,  town  governments  are  effective  in  providing  key  inputs  to  investors,  such  as \nserviced  land,  regulatory  support,  and  adequate  supplies  of  labor.  But  population  growth  in  most \nsmall  cities  and  towns  has  not  kept  pace,  largely  because  capital-intensive  industries  generate \nrelatively  little  employment  and  the  perception  among  rural  residents  that  there  are  greater \neconomic opportunities in large cities. The dispersal of businesses, with only 35% of enterprises in \ntowns and townships in 2007 located in urban areas and the rest in villages,9 prevents towns from \nachieving the economies of scale necessary to generate mass employment.  \n \n12.  Where  growth  is  occurring,  it  has  come  at  a  high  environmental  cost.  Industrial \ndevelopment has outstripped infrastructure provision and urban management capacity, causing the \ndegradation  of  the  natural  environment  and  living  conditions.  Coverage  rates  for  urban \nenvironmental services are inadequate, and pollution levels are high. Many areas of the province \nsuffer  high  rates  of  air,  water,  and  land  pollution,  creating  a  serious  threat  to  human  health  and \nputting downward pressure on life expectancy. Hebei suffers a serious water supply shortage, with \nwater  supply  per  capita  at  307  cubic  meters,  which  is  only  14%  of  the  national  average. \nGroundwater is pumped at unsustainable rates, lowering the water table, causing land subsidence, \nand  increasing  the  fluoride  and  nitrate-nitrogen  content  of  water.10 Land  subsidence  as  water  is \nextracted  weakens  flood  protection  and  exacerbates  water  logging  in  urban  areas  because \ndrainage  is  less  effective.  Water  scarcity  substantially  restricts  economic  development  and  is  an \nobstacle  to  enhancing  people\u2019s  living  standards.  Monitoring  by  the  Hebei  provincial  government \n(HPG) in 2007 found that 68.5% of 777 effluent outfalls discharging into the rivers of Hebei did not \n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2002.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fto  support \n\nlabor-intensive  service  and \n\n4 \n \nmeet  their  respective  water  quality  standards.  Over  the  years,  the  discharge  of  untreated \nwastewater  into  rivers  has  caused  significant  water  quality  deterioration,  environmental  pollution, \nodor, and public health problems. Heating coverage is very low at 14%, and the preponderance of \nsmall and inefficient boilers means a large number of scattered polluting sources in terms of bottom \nash  piles  and  emission  chimneys.  Solid  waste  management  is  rudimentary  and  environmental \nprotection poor. Local governments lack the capital or expertise to provide infrastructure in a timely \nfashion that would mitigate the environmental impacts of their economic success. \n \n13. \nThe  circumstances  of  the  three  core  subprojects  in  Bazhou  City,  Zhaoxian  County,  and \nZhengding County typify the key issues in Hebei Province: lack of drinking water, poor air quality, \nand  underdeveloped  solid  waste  management.  The  locations  are  unable  to  attract  private  sector \ninvestment or generate the jobs that would encourage rural\u2013urban migration. The growth of these \ntowns is constrained by the absence of economic linkages with larger urban centers and by poor \ninfrastructure  that  cannot  adequately  support  secondary  and  tertiary  economic  activity.  The \nProject\u2019s  intervention  specifically  addresses  these  key  issues  with  the  following  environmental \nobjectives: (i) improve air quality by substituting centralized heating for small boilers and household \ncoal burning, (ii) improve public health by supplying reliable supplies of potable water, (iii) collect \nand treat wastewater before discharging it into the environment, (iv) improve river quality and flood \nprotection capacity, and (v) improve municipal solid waste collection and treatment.  \n \nThe  primary  sector  still  accounts  for  45%  of  Hebei\u2019s  workforce  and  15%  of  its  gross \n14. \ndomestic product. To absorb rural labor, towns need to attract investment by improving municipal \nservices \nin \ninfrastructure  in  Hebei  towns  lags  province-wide  investment  rates  and  development  needs.  Total \ninvestment in city infrastructure was CNY298 billion in 2005, or 72% of Hebei\u2019s total investment in \nfixed assets, while only CNY57.96 billion was spent on county-level infrastructure in Hebei\u2019s towns, \nwhich  are  home  to  32.4  million  people,  or  60%  of  the  rural  population.  This  resulted  in  anemic \neconomic  growth  of  2%  in  small  towns.  National  and  provincial  policies  call  for  the  physical  and \neconomic  integration  of  towns  into  such  larger  urban  agglomerations  as  metropolitan  areas  and \ndevelopment  corridors  to  generate  jobs  and  initiate  a  virtuous  circle  of  economic  investment,  job \ncreation,  and  rural\u2013urban  migration.  These  low-growth  towns  require  reliable,  high-quality \nenvironmental  infrastructure  to  attract  productive  investments  and  improve  living  conditions  for \nlocal residents.  \n \n15. \nThe proposed ADB financing offers cities and towns in the poorer counties of Hebei to the \nnorth and west of Beijing the opportunity to develop their urban infrastructure in a more sustainable \nmanner, which will enable investments in natural resource processing, manufacturing, and services \nand  attract  population  from  rural  areas.  Other  towns  that  have  already  achieved  high  economic \ngrowth  rates,  such  as  those  located  along  the  Shijiazhuang\u2013Tangshan  development  axis,  can \nimprove  living  conditions  by  investing  in  urban  environmental  infrastructure  to  be  financed  under \nthe proposed Project and ensuring proper environmental management. \n \n16. \nProject  Rationale.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  is  committed  to  developing  small  cities \nand  towns  as  a  way  to  foster  economic  growth,  generate  employment,  narrow  the  rural\u2013urban \nincome  gap,  and  increase  national  economic  productivity  and  reduce  poverty.  Growth  in  small \ncities  and  towns  creates  potential  economic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor,  who  are  attracted  to \nthe  alternative  income  sources  available  in  urban  areas.  This  is  the  key  to  realizing  the  PRC\u2019s \nvision  of  a  \u201charmonious  society,\u201d  in  which  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  are  shared  more \nequitably.  Hebei  implements  this  policy  through  targeted  urbanization  in  medium-sized  cities  and \nstrengthening physical and economic linkages between counties and their rural hinterlands.  \n \n\nindustrial  sectors.  Public \n\ninvestment \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n17. \nTo  date,  Hebei  Province  has  not  exploited  its  geographic  proximity  to  Beijing.  Economic \nlinkages  are  underdeveloped,  as  Hebei\u2019s  heavy  industrial  economy  is  ill-suited  to  provide  the \nconsumer goods and services that are most in demand in the capital. The backwardness of poor \ntowns  and  rural  areas  around  Beijing,  particularly  to  the  north  and  west,  limits  Hebei\u2019s  ability  to \nbuild  labor,  information,  and  technology  linkages  with  Beijing\u2019s  economy.  Further,  Beijing\u2019s \ndependency on Hebei for water has caused significant deterioration of Hebei\u2019s natural environment \nin terms of water scarcity, pollution, and subsidence.  \n \n18.  While Hebei towns have the potential to drive economic growth at the county level, growth \nrates  today  are  uneven  across  the  province,  with  many  small  cities  unable  to  generate  sufficient \njobs  or  attract  rural  migrants.  One  of  the  main  constraints,  as  emphasized  by  the  Hebei  Urban \nConstruction  11th  FYP,  is  the  substandard  quality  of  urban  infrastructure.  To  fulfill  their  potential \nwith  respect  to  increasing  economic  efficiency  and  enabling  a  more  harmonious  form  of \ndevelopment, small cities and towns need better infrastructure and municipal services to \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nattract investment, especially in labor-intensive industries and services, by building \nreliable,  high-quality  infrastructure  such  as  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  district \nheating; \nprovide  a  decent  urban  environment  to  their  residents  by  substituting  centralized \nheating for household coal burning to improve the air quality, collecting and treating \nwastewater  before  discharging  it  into  the  environment,  and  introducing  sanitary \npractices in solid waste collection and treatment; and \nextend the benefits of growth to all residents through improved coverage and quality \nof basic municipal services to households across the socioeconomic spectrum.  \n\n \n19. \nIn  line  with  Hebei\u2019s  key  urbanization  strategy,  the  ADB-financed  sector  loan  will  provide \nsupport  to  small  cities  and  towns  toward  ensuring  effective  urban  infrastructure  services  and \nimproved administrative and management capacity in infrastructure planning, implementation, and \noperation  to  successfully  manage  urban  growth  in  the  future.  Greater  integration  and  networking \nacross small cities and towns in Hebei will be promoted to the extent possible under the Project, \nand best practices and lessons from similar county-level environment improvement projects in the \nPRC  will  be  disseminated. 11   The  Project  is  part  of  the  increased  efforts  of  HPG  to  support \nthat  balances  economic  growth,  social  advancement,  and \nsocioeconomic  development \nenvironmental  improvement  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development  (footnote  6).  The \noverarching  objective  of  the  subprojects  for  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  river  improvement,  and  district  heating  improvement  will  be  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment through the provision of basic urban infrastructure and municipal services and enable \nthese towns to establish an investment climate that will attract the private sector, sustain enterprise \nreform,  and  ensure  that  existing  industries  and  enterprises  become  more  sustainable.  Different \ntowns will promote different economic sectors, depending on their base and their potential. Some \nHebei towns will invest to promote industry, including agroprocessing and pharmaceuticals, while \nothers  will  improve  the  environment  and  extend  basic  services  to  residents.  Still  other  towns  will \nprovide infrastructure to support the growth of tourism and services. \n \nThe Project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, which is concerned \n20. \nwith managing the environment, catalyzing investment, and improving governance (footnote 4). It \nconforms to ADB\u2019s water policy and water financing program, both of which seek to improve urban \nwater  investments  through  TA  and  investments  in  water  supply,  sanitation  and  wastewater \n                                                 \n11  Including ADB. 2006.

It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy, \nwhich  supports  infrastructure  investment  in  settlements  that  are  dynamic  engines  of  economic \ngrowth  and  employment  creation,  innovation,  and  entrepreneurship,  as  well  as  being  sources  of \nsocial  services.  The  Project  will  improve  the  living  environment  of  urban  residents,  including  the \npoor,  through  improved  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  district \nheating, and river rehabilitation. It indirectly supports PRC and ADB climate change initiatives and \nADB\u2019s  broader  Clean  Energy  and  Environment  Program  (2008)  by  enhancing  water  resource \nmanagement  and  introducing  secondary  wastewater  treatment,  district  heating,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement and treatment.

The  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  Hebei's  Social  and \nEconomic Development 11th FYP and the Hebei Urbanization 11th FYP, which highlight promoting \nthe  development  of  small  cities  and  towns  to  support  urbanization  that  is  economically,  socially, \nand  environmentally  sustainable.  In  view  of  the  number  of  subprojects,  variability  in  subproject \npreparedness,  and  possibility  that  some  of  them  may  change  during  project  implementation,  the \nGovernment  agreed  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  ADB  sector  loan  modality,  which  allows  for \nflexible implementation.  \n \n22. \nThe Project will support physical investments in priority small cities and towns with urgent \nneed for infrastructure improvement and environmental management and with local governments \nthat demonstrate interest and commitment. The sector loan approach is based on the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government's sector policies, development objectives, and approach to urban \ninfrastructure  development  and  environmental  management  are  well  formulated.  \nThe Government continually updates its sector policies with ADB support.12   \nSector institutions are well developed and, with additional strengthening and support \nprovided  under  the  Project,  will  have  the  capacity  to  implement  the  sector \ninvestment plan, particularly for county and town governments. HPG, the Executing \nAgency  (EA),  has  successfully  implemented  similar  environmental  improvement \nprojects,  and \nin  capital \nimprovements to basic urban infrastructure.  \nThe  sector  investment  plan  and  the  planned  subprojects  are  well  conceived  and \nformulated to meet the priority needs of the Hebei Urbanization 11th FYP.   \n\nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  have  experience \n\nthe \n\n \n23. \nHPG  has  met  these  conditions.  It  has  developed  subproject  identification,  selection, \npreparation and appraisal criteria and procedures to ensure that the Project will facilitate achieving \nthe  objectives  of  sector  policies  and  plans.  Appendix  3  shows  the  process  for  subproject \nidentification,  selection,  preparation,  and  appraisal.  Supplementary  Appendix  C  presents  the \nsubproject appraisal criteria.  \n \nComprehensive  assessment  of  three  core  subprojects  has  been  carried  out.  The \n24. \nsubprojects have developed approaches that can be replicated in urban centers throughout Hebei \nProvince  and  may  be  used  to  demonstrate  to  other  provinces  across  the  PRC  how  to  formulate \nplanning strategies and implement programs to support the structured development of small cities \nand  towns.  Each  of  the  three  core subprojects in  Bazhou City,  Zhaoxian  County,  and  Zhengding \nCounty has features that make it representative of other towns in Hebei Province and capable of \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  the  PRC  in  updating  urbanization  policies  and  strategies  to  meet  the  challenges  of \nurbanization and town development. Recent studies include the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy Study (footnote 2), \nHebei Provincial Development Strategy (footnote 8) and ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of \nChina  for  the  Study  on  Sustainable  Urbanization  in  Metropolitan  Regions.  Manila  (TA  4702\u2013PRC).  The  Project  will \nprovide support through the capacity development component and the WFPF grant support to water and wastewater \nimplementing agencies. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nachieving  a  demonstration  effect  for  subsequent  subproject  cities  and  towns.  Through  such \nfeedback mechanisms as knowledge hubs and information-sharing forums, the core subproject city \nand  county  governments  will  share  their  experiences  and  tools,  first  with  subsequent  subproject \ntowns  and  later  with  other  towns.13 The  Hebei  Provincial  Construction  Bureau,  a  member  of  the \nproject leading group (PLG), will participate in performance monitoring and replication activities to \nmaximize the sector-wide impact of  the Project. The lead entities in Hebei for town  planning, the \nConstruction  Bureau  and  the  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  will  help  operationalize  and \nroll out the Project\u2019s integrated approach to town development planning by using it as a criterion for \napproval of the master plans of subsequent subproject small cities and towns, as they are prepared \nduring  project  implementation,  and of  other  towns.14 As  part of  project  performance  management \nsystem (PPMS) activities, the Construction Bureau will help the Hebei project management office \n(PMO)  monitor  urban  environmental  infrastructure  improvement  at  the  provincial  level.  The \nproposed  UN-HABITAT  and  Water  Fund  Pilot  Demonstration  Activity  grants  will  develop \ncommunity-based  sustainability  and  replicability  mechanisms  with  HPG  that  ensure  that  lessons \nand best practices are disseminated province-wide through public information campaigns. \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  further  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on  (i) the \n25. \nintegrated  development  of  cities,  towns,  and  rural  areas  to  generate  employment  and  reduce \npoverty; (ii) sustainable urban environmental management; (iii) the economic sustainability of urban \ninfrastructure  services;  (iv)  a  participatory  approach  to  project  design  and  implementation;  and \n(v) governance and anticorruption policy.  \n \n26. \nIntegrated Development of Cities, Towns, and Rural Areas to Generate Employment \nand  Reduce  Poverty.  HPG  will  use  the  subproject  selection  criteria  to  target  small  cities  and \ntowns that can maximize investments for generating employment and improving the environment. \nHPG  will  refine  its  poverty  reduction  policy  to  encourage  small  cities  and  towns  to  promote  job \ncreation, especially in labor-intensive service industries, through (i) urban infrastructure delivery; (ii) \nthe  effective  self-promotion  of  towns  as  good  locations  for  business  investment;  and  (iii) \ncommunity-based approaches to environmentally sustainable infrastructure management. \n \n27. \nSustainable  Urban  Environmental  Management.  HPG  will  help  local  governments  to \nadopt  a  more  integrated  approach  to  urban  infrastructure  planning  and  delivery,  combining \nsubsectoral  interventions  to  achieve  greater  impact.  Improved  project  preparation  guidelines  will \nrequire \nimprovement  projects, \nsimultaneously  improve  solid  waste  and  wastewater  management  services  to  effectively  reduce \ndischarges  of  waste  into  the  river.  Similarly,  to  maximize  how  improvements  to  energy  services \nreduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  improve  air  quality,  city  and  county  governments  will  be \nadvised  to  plan  and  coordinate  district  heating  and  natural  gas  system  extensions  at  the  same \ntime.  Wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  should  also  be  operated  as  one  integrated \nsystem managed by a single agency to ensure closer coordination, more comprehensive demand \nmanagement, and higher cost recovery for improved services.  \n \n28. \nEconomic Sustainability of Urban Infrastructure Services. HPG intends to improve the \nenforcement of national Government circular no. 1192 of 1999 so that providers of urban services \ncan  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover  their  costs.  In  many  towns,  this  will  require  that  user \ntariffs  be  increased  gradually  to  the  point  where  tariff  revenues  cover  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  and  debt  service.  To  improve  affordability  for  low-income  groups,  it  is  advisable  to \n                                                 \n13 Knowledge sharing and networking will be promoted and include the province-wide dissemination of certified emission-\n\nthat  city  and  county  governments,  when  planning  river \n\nreduction and clean carbon technology for sludge treatment, landfills, and heating. \n\n14  Town  planning  in  the  PRC  is  based  on  the  socioeconomic  plan,  land  utilization  plan,  and  master  plan.  The  most \ninfluential  of  the  three\u2014the  master  plan\u2014defines  permitted  land  uses  and  identifies  priority  trunk  infrastructure \ninvestments to be prepared during the following 10 to 20 years. \n\n \n\n\fframework \n\nthe  general \n\n8 \n \nrationalize the pricing of urban services, ensuring that the poor have access to basic services and \nthat those consuming more should pay more, with a view to promoting resource conservation and \neffective  demand  management.  HPG  will  endeavor  to  work  with  local  governments  to  formulate \nand implement policy and guidelines for using progressive tariffs for water supply, wastewater and \nsolid  waste  management,  and  district  heating  in  small  cities  and  towns.  Through  the  proposed \n$250,000 grant from the WFPF to HPG, ADB will support strengthening water sector governance \nand the financial management of water and wastewater service providers involved in the Project. \n \n29. \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption.  Bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  must  observe  the \nhighest  ethical  standards  in  procurement  and  the  execution  of  contracts.  Sanctions  will  apply  if \nfraud or corruption in procurement are discovered. The EA and the subproject local governments \nwere advised to undertake a number of actions identified under the implementation arrangements.  \n \nExternal  Assistance.  Since  1992,  ADB  has  provided  $3.8  billion  in  loans  to  the  PRC  for \n30. \nurban development projects. Hebei has borrowed $1.3 billion from the World Bank and ADB during \n1981\u20132005 in all sectors. Appendix 4 provides details of the external assistance. \n \nLessons.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  urban  development  projects  indicates  the  following:  (i) \n31. \nstrategic  master  plans  can  provide \nfor  urban  development  and \nenvironmental  management  but  need  to  incorporate  sustainability  mechanisms;  (ii)  as  increased \npublic awareness and education are important ways to improve the urban environment, community \nconsultation  and  involvement,  and  training  on  environmental  health  and  protection  should  be \nprovided  to  beneficiaries;  (iii)  the  establishment  of  an  effective  internal  and  external  monitoring \nmechanism  for  resettlement  implementation  is  important  to  ensure  the  effective  coordination  and \ntimely  implementation  of  land  approval,  compensation,  and  rehabilitation  measures;  and  (iv) \nupfront  training  on  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures  have  to  be  provided  to  county  agencies  to \nensure compliance and strict adherence to these requirements. These issues have been reviewed \nduring project processing, and the relevant lessons have been incorporated in the project design. \n \n32. \nExperience  in  environmental  infrastructure  improvement,  wastewater  management,  and \nwater  supply  in  the  PRC  indicates  that  projects  are  well  planned,  demand  parameters  are  well \ndefined  and  implemented  in  a  timely  manner,  and  tariffs  are  raised  as  required.  Consumers \nwillingly pay higher fees for improved infrastructure and services in water, wastewater, solid waste, \nand heating. Issues related to utility tariffs, cost recovery, and the commercialization of basic urban \nservices  for  water,  heating,  and  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  were  carefully \naddressed  during  project  preparation.  Lessons  from  previous  environmental  infrastructure \nimprovement  projects  in  cities  and  counties  were  reflected  in  the  project  design.  These  lessons \ninclude  (i)  greater  focus  on  institutional  strengthening  to  improve  sector  corporate  governance, \ncompliance with ADB requirements, and urban infrastructure management; (ii) improved provincial, \nmunicipal,  and  county  coordination;  (iii) financial,  operational,  and  institutional  arrangements  for \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  in  the  sectors  in  small  cities  and  towns;  (iv)  scaling  up \ndemonstration impact of core subprojects across small cities and towns in Hebei Province; and (v) \nensuring community support for the sustainability of improved infrastructure and services.  \n \nLessons from ADB\u2019s experience in urban development projects highlight the importance of \n33. \n(i)  a  comprehensive  and  participatory  approach  to  project  preparation;  (ii)  a  well  planned  and \ncoordinated,  participatory,  and  integrated  approach  to  the  design  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects;  and  (iii)  a  realistic  approach  to  supply-and-demand  assessment  of  design  facilities. \nThese lessons have been considered in the project design. The following recommendations of the \nTown-Based Urbanization Strategy Study TA (footnote 2) have been incorporated into the design \nof the Project, especially in subproject selection:  \n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTown  development  should  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  development  of  larger \nsubregions. \nTowns should be targeted based on their potential to grow economically and provide \njobs to migrants from rural areas. \nGovernment  should  introduce  to  poverty  alleviation  programs  a  town-based \ncomponent. \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nframework  defines  performance  parameters \n\n34. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  improved  urban  environment  and  improved  public \nhealth and quality of life for the residents of small cities and towns in Hebei Province. The outcome \nof the Project will be improved urban infrastructure and municipal services in about 10 small cities \nand towns in Hebei Province. \n \n35. \nDeveloped  in  close  collaboration  with  subproject  cities  and  towns,  the  project  design  and \ninfrastructure \nmonitoring \nsubsectors.  Water  supply  components  include  the  development  or  expansion  of  groundwater \nresources, construction or upgrading of water treatment facilities, and/or expansion of distribution \nnetworks.  Wastewater  management  components  include  the  installation  of  wastewater  collection \nsystems  and  interceptors  and/or  the  construction  or  upgrading  of  wastewater  treatment  plants \n(WWTPs)  with  sludge  treatment.  Solid  waste  management  components  include  the  collection, \ntransfer,  and/or  treatment  of  municipal  solid  waste,  including  sorting,  recycling,  composting \nfacilities,  and  sanitary  landfills.  River  improvement  entails  dredging  riverbeds;  constructing \nembankments,  rubber  dams,  and  flood  control  works;  and/or  installing  sewers.  District  heating \ncomponents include the construction of primary and secondary heating stations, installation of heat \ntransmission and distribution networks, and/or installation of building and individual user meters. \n \nB. \n\nfive  eligible \n\nOutputs \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n36. \nThe Project includes about 10 subproject small cities and towns. Detailed assessment and \nanalysis  have  been  undertaken  for  the  three  core  subprojects.  The  technical  analysis  of  core \nsubprojects  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  Each  subproject  has  been  prepared  as  a  viable \ninvestment subproject and includes one or more components in environmental infrastructure. The \nBazhou  City  subproject  includes  two  components:  (i)  Shengfang  Town  water  supply  system \nrehabilitation and expansion and (ii) Mangniu River improvement and sewer network rehabilitation. \nZhaoxian  County  has  three  components:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  district  heating \nnetwork, (ii) construction of a solid waste processing and recycling plant, and (iii) expansion of the \nexisting  WWTP.  Zhengding  County\u2019s  component  is  to  improve  the  solid  waste  management \nsystem,  including  the  construction  of  a  waste  processing  and  recycling  plant.  Each  of  the  three \ncore  subprojects  has  features  that  make  it  representative  of  other  towns  in  Hebei  Province  and \ncapable of achieving a demonstration effect for subsequent subproject cities and towns. Candidate \nsubsequent  subprojects,  including  those  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E,  will  be  prepared \nand appraised during project implementation. \n \n37. \nThe  Project  includes  institutional  capacity  development  measures  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation  and  the  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities.  Capacity \ndevelopment  includes  consulting  services  on  project  management  and  training  the  EA  and  IAs \nduring implementation. Implementation consultants will help the EA to manage the project and help \nthe  IAs  to  (i)  implement  the  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB  and  Government  requirements, \nparticularly  on  safeguard  policies;  (ii)  become  operationally  efficient  and  financially  sustainable \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \nentities; (iii) comply with relevant national policies for cost recovery and tariff and enterprise reform; \nand (iv) prepare and implement sound plans for the O&M of current and future infrastructure works. \n \n38. \nThe  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  WFPF  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to \n$250,000,  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  to  strengthen  the  management  capacity  of  water  and \nwastewater  service  providers  involved  in  the  Project.  The  grant  will  help  participating  subproject \nIAs  in  water  and  wastewater  to  (i)  develop  a  more  corporate  approach  to  water  and  wastewater \nservice provision, (ii) adopt a more demand-driven approach to service delivery, and (iii) strengthen \ntheir financial management and cost recovery. \n \n39. \nPartnership  with  UN-HABITAT  will  further  strengthen  institutional  capacity  through  the \nproposed  $650,000  community-based  urban  environmental  program,  which  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  local  governments  and  nongovernment  organizations  in  environmental  planning  and \nmanagement and in the delivery of community-based water and sanitation services with a focus on \nimproving hygiene to reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n40. \nSector  and  Subsector  Policy  and  Strategy  Dialogue.  The  development  of  the  Project \nwas  directly  supported  by  ADB-financed  advisory  policy  and  strategy  studies.  The  underlying \ntechnical  approach  for  the  Project  is  based  on  relevant  government  policies  and  the  findings  of \nsuccessfully  completed  advisory  TA  on  town-based  urbanization  strategy  and  Hebei  provincial \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  studies  highlighted  that  environmental  protection  and  sustainability \nneed to be addressed specifically relating to resource management; reducing the pollution of air, \nwater, and land; water scarcity; and effective governance.  \n \n41. \nComprehensive  Basic  Urban  Services  for  Small  Cities  and  Towns.  The  Project  will \nachieve a demonstration effect for other small cities and towns. The core subproject towns, which \nare  representative  of  other  towns  in  Hebei,  will  demonstrate  how  small  cities  and  towns  can \neffectively  develop  and  manage  urban  infrastructure  services  that  are  necessary  for  them  to \nachieve  economically,  socially,  and  environmentally  sustainable  urban  sector  development  and \npromote greater economic integration with rural and metropolitan areas.  \n \n42. \nClean and Energy-Efficient Technologies. The Project will support ADB\u2019s climate change \ninitiatives  such  as  encouraging  the  use  of  energy-efficient  technologies  to  improve  economic \nefficiency and environmental quality and enable sustainable development. Steps include reducing \ncoal  usage  in  small  and  inefficient  boilers  for  heating  and  enabling  the  composting  of  organic \nwastes and sludge treatment. \n \n43. \nFinancial  Management  and  Corporate  Governance.  The Multi-Donor Trust Fund under \nthe  WFPF  will  provide  a  $250,000  grant  for  the  Project  to  strengthen  financial  management  and \ncorporate governance in water and wastewater companies in participating small cities and towns in \nHebei Province. Appendix 5 is a summary of the support for water and wastewater facilities, and \nSupplementary Appendix F provides details about the scope of work under the grant. \n \n44. \nCommunity-Based  Urban  Environmental  Program.  UN-HABITAT  has  signified  support \nfor a grant to establish pilot sustainability mechanisms in communities focusing on effective water \ndemand  management,  sanitation,  and  community  organizing  to  ensure  community  support  to the \nmanagement and sustainability of project facilities. A draft proposal for the UN-HABITAT grant for \nan indicative amount of $650,000 over a 3-year implementation period, in Supplementary Appendix \nG, was prepared by ADB and will be subject to further discussion between UN-HABITAT and the \nHebei  PMO.  Further,  a  draft  proposal  to  the  Water  Fund  for  Pilot  Demonstration  Activity  was \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nprepared amounting to $50,000, which focuses on a school- and community-based information and \neducation program for water and sanitation in Zhengding County (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $235.9  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n45. \n$22.2  million.  The  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  as  well  as  interest  and  other \ncharges  during  implementation.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  42%  of  the  project  cost.  Table  1 \nprovides  a  summary  of  the  project  investment  plan.

The  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  the  municipal  governments  concerned  and \nthen to the IAs. The terms and conditions of the loan proceeds transferred within the government \nwill  be  the  same  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan,  with  municipal  governments  bearing  the  interest  and \nexchange rate variation risk. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 6 years; \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility plus a standard spread of 0.20%; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the negotiated Loan and Project Agreements. \n \n48. \nThe  Government  provided  ADB  with  (i)  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  from  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility  under  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this \nwas its own independent decision not relying on any communication or advice from ADB. Appendix \n7  presents  the  onlending  arrangements  and  indicative  funds  flow.  The  Hebei  PMO  and  the  IAs \nhave confirmed and signed the cost estimates and financing plan for each subcomponent and for \nthe Project as a whole. The financing plan for the Project proposed by the Hebei Provincial Finance \nBureau  and  commitment  letters  from  county  governments  to  confirm  the  sources  of  counterpart \nfunds to finance the project were submitted to ADB in July 2008. \n \n49. \nUnder  fund  transfer  arrangements,  the  Government  of  PRC  will  make  the  Loan  proceeds \navailable  to  HPG,  and  then  from  HPG  to  the  concerned  municipal  or  county  governments.  The \nmunicipal  government  will  transfer  or  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  end-borrowers  (project \nimplementing agency). The terms and conditions of the Loan proceeds will be the same as those of \nthe Loan with the end-borrowers bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks. \n \nF. \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n50. \nHPG will be the EA of the Project. The PLG, made up of representatives of five provincial \nagencies,  was  established  in  2007  to  coordinate  infrastructure  investments  across  the  province. \nThe PLG is chaired by the vice secretary-general of HPG. \n \n51. \nThe  PMO  was  established  by  decree  in  2007  in  the  Hebei  Finance  Department  to \nundertake and manage the Project\u2019s day-to-day activities. In each subproject location, a PLG and a \nPMO has been or will be set up to liaise with the provincial PMO and to oversee and manage the \nwork  undertaken  by  the  IA.  PLG  and  PMO  arrangements  have  been  finalized  in  core  subproject \nlocations.  The  IAs  for  the  core  subproject  components  are  Bazhou  Urban  Construction  and \nDevelopment  Company  Limited;  Zhaoxian  County  Urban  Investment  and  Development  Company \nLimited; and Zhengding County Solid Waste Treatment Plant. Project organization is in Appendix \n8, and the institutional arrangements and assessment are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Appraisal \n\nIn addition to the three core subprojects, additional subprojects will be selected, prepared, \n\n52. \nand appraised during sector project implementation using the following three-stage process. \n \n53. \nSubproject  Identification  and  Selection. The subprojects will be selected in accordance \nwith the following criteria: (i) confirmation by the local government of its ability and willingness to \narrange counterpart financing and comply with ADB safeguard policies and other requirements; (ii) \nconfirmation by the concerned local government on its willingness to comply with ADB safeguard \npolicies  and  other  requirements;  (iii)  the  implementation  period  of  the  subproject  is  within  2009\u2013\n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n2015; (iv) eligibility of the components (water supply, wastewater management, river improvement, \nsolid  waste  management,  district  heating,);  and  (v)  anticipated  positive  impact  on  the  urban \nenvironment, employment generation, economic growth, and service levels and coverage.  \n \n54. \nSubproject  Preparation.  The  participating  city  or  county  government  and  implementing \nagency,  with  the  guidance  of  the  Hebei  PMO,  will  prepare  project  design  documents  including  a \nproject  proposal,  feasibility  study,  and  preliminary  engineering  design  for  the  components  of  the \nproposed subproject in accordance with the national project investment specifications. The project \ndesign  documents  will  cover  subproject  rationale;  scope;  components;  technical  analysis;  cost \nestimates;  financing  plan;  implementation  arrangements;  financial  management  assessment;  and \nfinancial,  economic,  social,  and  institutional  analyses.  These  documents  will  be  submitted  to  the \nHebei  Development  and  Reform  Commission  for  approval.  The  participating  city  or  county \ngovernment will also prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and a resettlement plan \nto be submitted to the concerned provincial departments and bureaus for approval.  \n \n55. \nSubproject  Appraisal  and  Approval. The Hebei PMO and other concerned bureaus will \nbe responsible for appraising the subprojects in accordance with criteria agreed upon by the PRC \nGovernment and ADB. The subproject PMO will prepare a subproject appraisal report, which will \nfollow the template in the project preparatory TA final report, and submit the appraisal report to the \nmunicipal finance bureau for review and then to the Hebei PMO for further review. The Hebei PMO \nwill  submit  the  subproject  appraisal  report  to  the  Hebei  Finance  Bureau  and  Hebei  Development \nand Reform Commission for endorsement before submitting it to ADB for review and approval. \n \n56. \nSubsequent subprojects will receive the same extent of environmental safeguard scrutiny, \nmodeled on the EIAs for the three core subprojects and the summary EIA (SEIA). The Hebei PMO \nwill  submit  the  EIAs  for  the  subsequent  subprojects  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  comment,  and  having \nincorporated ADB\u2019s comments, the Hebei PMO will submit the revised EIAs for ADB for posting on \nthe  ADB  website  to  meet  the  120-day  disclosure  requirement.  For  other  safeguard  concerns,  a \nresettlement  framework  and  an  ethnic  minority  development  framework  were  prepared  for \nsubsequent  subprojects.  Draft  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  using  core  subproject \nresettlement plans as models.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n57. \nAs this is the first sector project for HPG, the selection and appraisal of the first one or two \nsubsequent  subprojects  will  likely  take  time  to  meet  ADB  and  domestic  requirements.  To  allow \nflexibility  for  HPG  to  select  subsequent  subprojects  to  meet  the  different  pace  of  development  in \nsmall cities and towns in Hebei, the Project will be implemented over 6 years, from 2009 to the end \nof  2015  (Appendix  9).  The  implementation  period  is  estimated  based  on  project  scope  and \nconstruction technology requirements. This schedule is considered realistic and feasible because \nthe project implementation arrangements have been established and preparatory works are under \nway. ADB has successful experience with similar projects in the PRC, and HPG has experience in \nenvironment improvement projects financed by ADB and the World Bank. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n58. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Contract  packages  have \nbeen  formulated  in  consultation  with  the  EA  and  IAs,  and  an  assessment  of  the  procurement \ncapacity  of  the  EA,  PMOs,  and  IAs  has  been  undertaken  (Supplementary  Appendix  K).  It  is \nrecommended that prior review be applied for all international competitive bidding contracts and for \nthe first national competitive bidding contract for works and goods, and that post review be applied \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \nfor  other  procurement  modes.  The  indicative  procurement  plan  for  consulting  services  and  civil \nworks  packages  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  the  detailed  procurement  plan  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix L. The Project includes provision for funding for 154 person-months of international and \nnational  consulting  services  to  support  the  Hebei  PMO,  city  and  town  PMOs,  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation and management and institutional capacity development. A consulting firm will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) using the standard quality- and cost-based selection method (80% quality and 20% \ncost)  and  simplified  technical  proposal.  The  consulting  services  will  cover  project  management, \nimplementation support, and institutional strengthening of the Hebei PMO, city and county PMOs, \nand IAs. Capacity development for the PMOs and IAs will be achieved through consultant inputs; \ntraining courses by specialized institutes and firms; in-country and/or overseas study visits; and the \nacquisition of training equipment financed from the loan (Supplementary Appendix M). \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n\n59. \nHPG  has  indicated  to  the  mission  its  intention to  use  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing to finance the recruitment of consultants, training, and the procurement of goods and civil \nworks  for  the  Bazhou  subproject  contract  packages  and  retroactive  financing  of  eligible \nexpenditures of up to $20 million, or about 20% of the ADB loan. The mission informed the Hebei \nPMO that retroactive financing is permitted only if (i) it is specifically agreed between ADB and the \nBorrower; (ii) the goods, works, services, and consultants for which it is requested are procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants; and (iii) \nthe  amount  to  be  retroactively  financed  does  not  exceed  20%  of  the  loan  amount.  The \nexpenditures  must  have  been  incurred  before  effectiveness  of  the  relevant  loan  but  generally  no \nearlier than 12 months before the signing date of the Loan Agreement. In either instance, detailed \nassessments  and  due  diligence  on  each  retroactive  financing  proposal  must  demonstrate  that  (i) \nthe  expenditures  incurred  are  genuine,  reasonable,  and  material  to  getting  the  Project  off  the \nground  and  (ii)  they  were  incurred  for  proper  reasons  and  in  a  transparent  manner  over  a \nreasonable period of time. The Government, HPG, and IAs were advised that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\n60. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  HPG,  the  PMOs,  and  the  implementing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  This  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132010), which includes the promotion of good governance by supporting \nreform  and  capacity  development  in  corporate  governance  (footnote  4).  HPG  has  indicated  its \ncommitment to fight corruption and a number of anticorruption actions are included as covenants in \nthe  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  Under  these  covenants,  HPG  will  (i)  involve  the  agencies \nresponsible  for  oversight  of  each  IA  in  bidding  and  construction  to  enhance  construction  quality \ncontrol  and  supervise  effective  work;  (ii)  introduce  a  dual  signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works \ncontract  winner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  agreement  with  the  IA;  (iii)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (iv)  engage  the  loan \nimplementation consultant to support the Hebei PMO, city and town PMOs, and IAs to ensure good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency in project operations. \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nto \n\ntime \n\nfrom \n\nADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n61. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \ntime).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation  with  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  HPG  will  establish  an  imprest  account \npromptly  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.15 Only  one  imprest \naccount will be established at the provincial finance bureau, which will be responsible for municipal \nand  county  withdrawal  applications.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  to  the  IAs  will  be \nbased  on  actual  expenditures  with  full  supporting  documents,  which  is  in  line  with  Ministry  of \nFinance  internal  regulations.  Withdrawal  applications  will  demonstrate  that  the  goods  and/or \nservices derive from ADB\u2019s members and are eligible for ADB financing. The maximum amount to \nbe deposited to the imprest account shall not exceed the estimated ADB share of eligible project \nexpenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan \namount, whichever is less. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used for the liquidation \nand  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account,  with  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding $200,000 per individual payment. Statement of expenditure will be used only by HPG to \nrequest  withdrawals  from  ADB.  The  HPG  will  set  up  a  separate  bank  account  for  the  $250,000 \ngrant from the WFPF, which will be used for engaging consultants and conducting trainings. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe Hebei PMO will coordinate with city and town PMOs to prepare semiannual progress \n62. \nreports  indicating  physical  progress  vis-\u00e0-vis  fund  utilization,  problems  encountered  during  the \nperiod under review, measures taken or proposed to remedy the problems, a proposed program of \nactivities. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and services financed from \nthe loan proceeds, following accounting principles and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law \nof the PRC. This law requires that the financial statements generally follow recognized accounting \nstandards. The IAs will set up and maintain separate project accounts. The financial statements of \nthe  project  accounts  and  the  annual  corporate  financial  statements  for  IAs  will  be  subject  to \nexternal audit by the audit bureau of the cities and the HPG Audit Bureau. Audits will be carried out \nin accordance with PRC audit regulations and must meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  will  be  part  of  the  audit \nreports.  The  IAs\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  audited  project  accounts  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  throughout  the \nimplementation period. HPG and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the \nuse of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. These reports will include \n(i) semiannual  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  (ii)  annual  reports,  and  (iii)  a  project \ncompletion report submitted not later than 3 months after the completion of project facilities. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n63. \nThe  PPMS  indicators,  their  relevance,  and  monitoring  requirements  were  discussed  with \nthe  PMOs  and  IAs  during  project  preparation.  The  indicators  are  based  on  the  monitoring \nindicators in the design and monitoring framework, consistent with sectoral indicators in the ADB \nResults  Framework  2008,  and  are  related  to  the  core  subprojects. 16 Similar  indicators  will  be \nformulated  for  subsequent  subprojects.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  provincial  and \ncity  PMOs  and  IAs  will,  with  the  assistance  of  the  loan  implementation  consultant,  develop \ncomprehensive PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the \nsubcomponents,  as  well  as  the  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  the  project  impact,  taking  into \n\n                                                 \n15  Bank charges on the imprest account will be financed from the ADB loan. \n16  ADB. 2008. ADB Results Framework. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \naccount  the  subsequent  subprojects\u2019  scope  and  components.  The  Hebei  PMO  will  (i)  refine  the \nfinalize  monitoring,  recording,  and  reporting \nPPMS;  (ii)  confirm  achievable \narrangements;  and  (iv)  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. The Hebei PMO will be responsible for monitoring and reporting on the performance \nof the Project based on the design and monitoring framework. The PMO will collect data, calculate \nthe indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a report to illustrate that the Project is generating \nthe intended outputs and outcomes in the subproject cities and towns in Hebei. \n \n\ntargets;  (iii) \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n64. \nBesides  regular  ADB  review  missions,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  2  years  after  the  start  of  project  implementation.  This  review  will \ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement, \nachievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for  policy  reform  and  capacity \ndevelopment measures. Feedback from the PPMS and grant activities will be analyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n65. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  1.2  million  people  in  Hebei  Province,  9.6%  of  whose \npopulation  is  rural  poor.  All  residents  in  the  10  subproject  small  cities  and  towns  will  benefit \nindirectly,  as  their  living  conditions  will  improve  from  (i)  improved  water  quality  and  quantity; \n(ii) reduced use of polluted water sources; (iii) reduced incidence of waterborne diseases and the \nresulting reduction in medical costs; and (iv) reduced pollution loads on air, water, and land from \nimproved  wastewater treatment; wastewater reuse; energy-efficient centralized heating; and solid \nwaste  treatment,  recycling,  and  composting.  During  the  construction  and  operation  stages  of  the \ncore subprojects alone, the Project will create 1,585 jobs directly and 2,536 jobs indirectly. About \n45% of the construction jobs are unskilled, many of which are likely to be filled by people currently \nunemployed.  In  total,  CNY1.02  billion  in  benefits  will  be  generated  in  small  cities  and  towns  of \nHebei.  Twenty  percent  of  poor  people  in  the  project  area  will  be  given  priority  access  to  new \nemployment opportunities. Health benefits are expected to accrue disproportionately to women and \nchildren.  The  Project  indirectly  supports  ADB\u2019s  broader  Clean  Energy  and  Environment  Program \n(2008)  by  enhancing  water  resource  management  and  introducing  facilities  for  secondary \nwastewater treatment, centralized heating, and solid waste management. \n \n66. \nSocial  Aspects.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  ensuring  that  poor \ncommunities  have  access  to  safe  and  reliable  water  supply  and  better  urban  services  and  enjoy \nimproved living conditions. It will mean more jobs for existing residents and new migrants in small \ncities and towns in Hebei Province. The water supply, wastewater, heating, solid waste, and river \nimprovements  will  stimulate  investment  in  industry,  resource  extraction,  and  the  service  sector, \nincluding  tourism.  The  reduction  in  medical  costs  related  to  waterborne  diseases  is  projected  at \nCNY75.6 million. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11, and the full \npoverty  and  social  assessment  and  the  social  action  plan  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  N. \nAnticipated  labor  displacements  caused  by  heating  subprojects  will  be  mitigated  with  a  labor \nreemployment \nin \n(Supplementary  Appendix  O).  Health \nSupplementary  Appendix  P,  and  the  ethnic  minority  development  framework  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix Q. \n \n67. \nResettlement  Aspects.  Project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  significant. \nThe  three  core  subprojects  will  affect  37  households  or  196  people  with  permanent  land \nacquisition,  30  households  or  137  people  with  the  loss  of  residential  structures,  and  four  small \nshops  with  13  employees.  In  total,  173  mu,  or  11.5  hectares  (ha),  of  land  will  be  acquired \npermanently,  including  162  mu,  or  10.8  ha,  of  cultivated  land.  Along  with  land  acquisition,  582 \n\nimpacts  are  shown \n\nframework \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nsquare  meters  (m2)  of  housing  and  624  m2  of  other  structures  will  be  demolished,  affecting  30 \nhouseholds or 137 people and relocating four small shops with 13 employees. A portion of the land \ncompensation fee will be used by the village collective for the construction of village facilities. The \nremaining portion of the land compensation fee, resettlement subsidy, and compensation for crops \nwill be paid directly to the affected people. Affected people will receive cash compensation for loss \nof  housing,  and  vulnerable  households  will  receive  official  assistance.    The  core  subprojects\u2019 \nresettlement plans have been endorsed by the EA and IAs and disclosed to affected people. The \nsubsequent  subprojects\u2019  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The summary resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 12, and the resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix R. \n \n68. \nFinancial  Aspects. The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) and financial net present \nvalues (FNPVs) were computed for all revenue-generating components\u2014water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, solid waste management, and district heating\u2014at November 2008 prices. The Bazhou \nShengfang  water  supply  component\u2019s  FIRR  is  5.3%,  and  its  FNPV  is  CNY41.7  million.  The \nZhaoxian  district  heating  component\u2019s  FIRR  is  9.7%,  and  its  FNPV  is  CNY185.6  million.  The \nWWTP FIRR is 8.7%, and its FNPV is CNY97.9 million. The solid waste processing facility\u2019s FIRR \nis 8.8%, and its FNPV is CNY57.0 million. All of these components are financially viable with FIRRs \ngreater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  about  1%.  The  Zhengding  solid  waste \nprocessing  component  is  viable  with  FIRR  of  8.7%  and  an  FNPV  of  CNY135.3  million.  This \ncomponent demonstrates that solid waste management income increase with the sale of recycled \nmaterials and compost for fertilizer. Current solid waste management fees are low and need to be \nrationalized to meet O&M cost recovery for integrated collection, treatment, and disposal. Heating \ntariffs  can  cover  the  cost  of  O&M,  depreciation,  and/or  debt  service.  Affordability  analysis  shows \nthat utility costs as a percentage of household income are reasonable, ranging from <1% for solid \nwaste  management  to  3%  for  water  and  wastewater  and  4%  for  heating.  HPG  and  the  county \ngovernments  have  provided  assurances  that  the  current  subsidies  through  the  minimum  living \nstandard scheme will continue in the future to ensure that the most vulnerable groups are protected \nfrom tariff increases. For the nonrevenue-generating component of river improvement, Bazhou City \nhas the financial capacity to provide the counterpart funding during implementation and the funds \nrequired  for  O&M  and  debt  service.  For  the  revenue-generating  components,  all  county \ngovernments  have  the  financial  capacity  to  provide  the  funding  required  during  implementation. \nThe  summary  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  13.  The  detailed  financial  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix S. \n \n69. \nFinancial  management  assessments  of  the  EA,  IAs,  and  operating  companies  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  T.  The  IAs  are  all  government  departments.  Three  of  the  operating \ncompanies  are  state-owned  enterprises,  and  one  is  a  county  government  department.  The \naccounting  and  financial  management  systems  for  financial  reporting  are  adequate  for  loan \nimplementation \nimprove \naccountability regarding the custody of assets, accounting procedures, and segregation of duties. \nSince many, if not all, of the IAs and operating companies have not implemented an ADB project, a \ncapacity  development  component  to  strengthen  financial  management  systems  and  provide \ntraining is included in the Project.  \n \n70. \nEconomic  Aspects.  The  three  core  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  socioeconomic \nindicators and the level of preparedness of subproject cities and towns to undertake investments in \nmunicipal infrastructure which directly support approved development master plans and programs \nand  the  potential  to  serve  as  models  for  preparing  subsequent  components  during  loan \nimplementation.  The  targeting  and  selection  of  subsequent  subproject  cities  and  towns  will  be \nbased  on  their  potential  to  attract  economically  productive  investments  that  will  provide  jobs  to \nmigrants from rural areas and on the urgency of environmental improvements. Employment growth \n\ninternal  control  needs  strengthening \n\nrequirements, \n\nthough \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \nis recognized to contribute more than output growth toward HPG\u2019s goal of closing the rural\u2013urban \nincome  gap.  Key  urbanization  issues  in  Hebei  are  (i)  inadequate  resources  to  provide  public \nservices to growing populations; (ii) severe air, river, and groundwater pollution arising from rapid \nindustrialization and resource extraction; (iii) a significant share of the urban population living under \nthe poverty line; and (iv) the lack of holistic and integrated management of urban development. The \nProject  aims  to  address  these  issues  in  the  participating  cities  to  help  promote  balanced  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  urbanization;  narrow  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap;  and  improve \nproduction,  employment,  and  living  conditions.  The  economic  analysis  indicates  that  the  core \ncomponents  are  economically  viable  and  stand  up  to  sensitivity  tests  even  in  the  worst-case \nscenario with increased costs and lower benefits. Economic internal rates of return for subproject \ncomponents are 19.0% for Shengfang water supply, 20.5% for Zhaoxian district heating, 48.6% for \nZhaoxian  wastewater  treatment,  23.1%  for  Zhaoxian  solid  waste  composting,  and  21.3%  for \nZhengding solid waste management. A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 14. Details are \nin Supplementary Appendix U. \n \n71. \nEnvironmental Aspects. The Project is classified as environmental category A. Extensive \npublic  consultations  involving  surveys,  meetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus  group  discussions \nwere  undertaken  during  project  preparation.  An  EIA  of  the  Project  was  conducted  based  on  the \nEIAs  prepared  for  the  three  core  subprojects.  An  SEIA  has  been  prepared  and  circulated  to  the \nADB  Board  of  Directors  and  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  2  December  2008.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  management  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  V)  was \nprepared  as  an  instruction  manual  to  assist  the  Hebei  PMO,  subproject  PMOs,  IAs,  and  local \ndesign  institutes  in  the  preparation  and  review  of  EIA  reports  and  environmental  management \nplans  for  subsequent  subprojects  according  to  ADB  requirements.  The  Project  is  expected  to \ngenerate substantial environmental benefits. Wastewater treatment will reduce pollutant discharges \nto rivers and groundwater. River improvement will strengthen flood protection, reducing economic \nloss  and  public  health  hazards  from  flooding.  Centralized  heating  will  improve  energy  efficiency, \neliminate  a  considerable  number  of  small  and  inefficient  boilers,  and  reduce  the  quantity  of  coal \nused,  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  This  Project  will  have  positive  effects  on  climate \nchange, thereby supporting PRC and ADB climate change initiatives.  \n \n72. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  have  no  adverse  impacts  during  construction  or  operation,  as \nmitigation and monitoring plans are in place and the environmental management and institutional \ncapacities  of  the  PMOs  and  IAs  are  strengthened  by  establishing  environmental  management \noffices  and  undertaking  a  training  program  on  environmental  management  planning.  To  manage \nrisk,  the  Hebei  PMO  will  ensure  (i)  extensive  training  in  environmental  management;  (ii)  the \nengagement of qualified project implementation consultants; and (iii) appropriate arrangements for \nproject implementation, monitoring, and mitigation, with ADB conducting project reviews.  \n \n73. \nThe  Project  supports  climate  change  adaptation  including  (i)  incorporation  of  climate \nchange issues, such as energy efficient measures, in urban master plans; (ii) comprehensive water \nmanagement,  such  as  long-term  water  availability  forecasting  for  new  development  areas  and \nadopting  comprehensive  water  balance  measures  during  project  implementation;  (iii)  sustainable \nwastewater and solid waste management including sludge digestion and biogas extraction; and (iv) \npromotion of clean energy for more efficient central heating. \n \n74. \nProject  Risks  and  Mitigation  Measures.  Using  conventional  engineering  designs  with \nproven performance records, the Project does not have any unusual technical risks. The following \nrisks could affect timely implementation, economic viability, and the realization of benefits: (i) failure \nto implement institutional strengthening for effective project implementation and management and \ngovernance;  (ii)  lack  of  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  major  changes  to  master  plans  in \nsubproject cities and towns; (iv) delay in providing counterpart funding; (v) failure to increase water \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nand  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  and  (vi)  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement issues, which could constrain the efficient implementation of the project works and the \nrestoration of livelihoods to affected people. Risks (i) and (ii) will be mitigated by the provision of \ninstitutional capacity development for subproject city and town PMOs and IAs with the support of \nthe loan implementation consultant. In addition, the PLG will provide oversight to mitigate project \nthe  project  design  and \nmanagement  risk.  Risk  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronizing \nimplementation schedules with other planned projects. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated through \ncovenanted assurances from subproject city and town governments on the provision of counterpart \nfunding  and  on  regular  tariff  reviews  and  increases.  Risk  (vi)  will  be  mitigated  by  strengthening \ninternal monitoring and supervision by the Hebei PMO and subproject city and town PMOs of the \nIAs, as well as by engaging a qualified external agency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n75. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  HPG,  subproject  governments, \nand  IAs  have  given  specific  assurances  as  summarized  below,  which  were  incorporated  in  the \nLoan  and  Project  Agreements.

The  pro-town \ndevelopment  policy  catalyzed  waves  of  migration  into  towns  and  small  cities 1  throughout  the \n1980s,  contributing  directly  to  the  steep  rise  of  urbanization  in  the  PRC  over  the  past  30  years. \nToday more than 40% of the national population lives in urban areas, up from 18% in 1978. As of \n2002, there were almost 20,000 towns in the country, with an average population of 32,300 and a \ntotal population of 640 million. \n \n2. \nThe 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) takes advantage of the potential of small cities and towns to \nincrease  national  economic  productivity  while  narrowing  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap,  thereby \ncontributing to  social  stability.  The  plan  calls  for strengthening  linkages  between  major  cities  and \nsmaller settlements at their periphery and calls for the equitable distribution of the benefits of urban \ndevelopment projects.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSmall City and Town Development in Hebei Province \n\n3. \nHebei\u2019s policy on the development of its small cities and towns mirrors the national policy. \nHebei\u2019s Social and Economic Development 11th FYP calls for the development of a more balanced \nurban  system  through  the  growth  of  medium-sized  cities  that  can  serve  as  economic  centers  for \nsurrounding  towns.  The  11th  FYP  aims  to  remove  \u201cinstitutional  obstacles  to  urbanization,\u201d  and \ncounty-level cities and towns are expected to enhance their economic relationship with rural areas \nthat depend primarily on agriculture. \n  \n4. \nBuilding on the successful implementation of environmental improvement projects in Hebei \nProvince  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (the \nGovernment) recognizes ADB\u2019s strong contribution to undertaking sector policy reforms to ensure \nlong-term  sustainability  and  effective  sector  performance.  The  proposed  ADB  financing  will \nstrengthen support to improving the urban environment in small cities and towns, particularly in the \npoorer  counties  of  Hebei  to  the  north  and  west  of  Beijing.  This  will  provide  the  opportunity  to \ndevelop their infrastructure that will enable investments in secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary \n(service)  industries.  Provincially,  capacity  development  in  project  planning,  implementation,  and \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  will  be  provided  to  the  key  entities  involved  in  town \ndevelopment  and  management  on  how  to  carry  out  effective  town  development  and  measure \nsuccess.  \n \n5. \nAs this is the first sector loan project undertaken by ADB in Hebei, lessons from previous \nprojects and existing institutional arrangements were carefully examined to ensure that the design \nof  sector  subprojects  and  institutional  arrangements  will  be  able  to  effectively  respond  to  future \nurban  development  challenges.  The  Hebei  Small  Cities  and  Towns  Development  Demonstration \nSector  Project  (the  Project)  has  taken  into  account  the  relevant  experience  of  ADB  in  similar \nenvironment-improvement  project  in  Shandong  Province.  These  are  small,  county-based  landfills \nwith a clean development mechanism and wastewater facilities to reduce domestic and industrial \npollution,  which  suffered  weak  institutional  capacity  in  project  management  and  O&M.2 Further, \n                                                 \n1   Small cities in the PRC are generally considered to have populations of 100,000\u2013250,000. \n2   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Shandong Hai River Basin Pollution Control Project. Manila (Loan 2237\u2013PRC). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n28 \n \ntraining  needs,  which  vary  by  county  according  to  capacity,  were  assessed  during  project \npreparation, and measures were formulated to address the following key issues:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCounty experience in ADB-financed projects is limited. \nThere  is  potential  for  the  Hebei  project  management  office  to  have  difficulty \ncoordinating and overseeing county subprojects because the projects are dispersed \nand have specific requirements. \nCounties lack technical, financial, and managerial capacities and need training and \nother interventions for effective project implementation.  \n\n \n6. \nFor  the  additional  subprojects,  detailed  institutional  arrangements,  training,  and  staffing \nneeds  will  be  considered,  and  existing  arrangements  modified  as  necessary,  during  project \nimplementation,  with  the  assistance of  the  loan implementation  consultant.  As  the  Project  covers \nseveral subsectors, the design of technical training interventions will be tailored to county-specific \nrequirements.  Small  cities  and  towns  lack  basic  urban  infrastructure  necessary  to  attract \nemployment-generating  industries  and  services  or  private  sector  initiatives  to  sustain  future \neconomic development. Poor environmental conditions pose constraints to enlisting private sector \nsupport  and  ensuring  a  critical  population  mass  in  small  cities  and  towns  able  to  support \ninvestments. The Project will address specific environmental concerns by (i) reducing sulfur dioxide \nand respirable suspended particulates through centralized heating systems; (ii) reducing untreated \ndomestic  and  industrial  wastewater  to  improve  river  water  quality  to  meet  class  II  standards \nthrough  wastewater  and  river  improvement  subprojects;  (iii)  improving  groundwater  quality  and \nreducing  fluoride  and  nitrate  nitrogen  levels  through  water  improvement  subprojects;  and  (iv) \nreducing  nonpoint  pollution  sources  such  as  solid  wastes  through  better  collection,  disposal, \ntreatment, and recycling facilities.  \n \n7. \nThe  proposed  interventions  in  county-level  cities  and  towns  will  directly  contribute  to  the \nprovincial  objective  of  promoting  integrated  development  of  urban  and  rural  areas.  To  promote \nquality  standards  in  urban  services,  the  Hebei  Urbanization  11th  FYP  emphasizes  the  need  for \nmore efficient delivery of urban services. Hebei\u2019s development strategy for small cities and towns \ncombines  urban  growth  management  with  the  promotion  of  economic  development.  A  key \nobjective  of  the  ADB-financed  Project  is  to  develop  the  capacity  of  the  Hebei  provincial \ngovernment, local governments, and implementing agencies. The Project includes institutional and \ncapacity  development  to  support  project  implementation  and  sustainable  O&M  of  project \ncomponents over the long term.  \n \n8. \nThe Project\u2019s institutional and capacity development activities will include (i) strengthening \nthe  organizational  capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  O&M \norganizations  to  improve  municipal  infrastructure  and  environmental  management  measures;  (ii) \nimplementing  the  Project  in  compliance  with  national  and  ADB  standards  pertaining  to  technical \nrequirements,  environmental  management,  social  safeguards,  procurement,  and \nfinancial \nmanagement;  (iii)  building  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  and  O&M  organizations\u2019  capacity  and \nresources  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  project  facilities  to  achieve  the  expected  benefits \nand  long-term  sustainability;  (iv)  strengthening  the  environmental  management  capacity  of \nsubproject  cities  and  towns  in  the  areas  of  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement;  and  (v)  building  awareness  of  innovations  for  future  requirements  such  as  carbon \nemission reduction and a clean development mechanism in solid waste, wastewater, and heating \nsubprojects,  which  Hebei  provincial  government  can  disseminate  across  the  province  to  elicit \nstrong support for PRC and ADB climate change initiatives. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nB. \n\nSubsectors  \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply and Wastewater Management \n\n9. \nThe national Government sets policies, standards, and guidelines for drinking water quality; \nwastewater  discharge;  and  planning  and  constructing  water,  wastewater,  and  drainage \ninfrastructure.  Provincial  agencies  set  policies,  approve  selected  actions  of  municipal  agencies \nsuch as tariff revisions and increases and large investment projects, and oversee compliance with \nwater supply and wastewater standards. Local government is responsible for providing water and \nwastewater  services.  Typically  there  is  a  municipally  owned  water  supply  company  and  a \ngovernment  bureau  for drainage.  Wastewater  companies  have  been  established  only  since  2000 \nand  often  focus  only  on  treatment,  leaving  the  collection  system  to  the  government  bureau. \nNational  Government  circular  no.  1192  of  1999  requires  urban  infrastructure  services  to  be \nprovided  on  a  cost-recovery  basis,  which  would  require  at  minimum  recovering  operation, \nmaintenance, and debt service costs through tariffs and other user fees. In most cases, small cities \nand towns set tariffs that are below cost recovery. Towns have water supply cost recovery rates of \n75%\u201390%  and  wastewater  cost  recovery  rates  of  60%\u201380%.  Urban  water  supply  coverage  rates \nare relatively high at 90% for prefectures (cities) and 80% for counties.3 However, most towns have \npoor water quality with old networks and inadequate treatment. Sector specialists have observed \nunaccounted-for  water  at  high  rates  of  25%\u201340%  in  most  towns.  Field  visits  to  small  cities  and \ntowns  indicate  that  wastewater  collection  coverage  rates  are  45%\u201365%.  Secondary  treatment  of \nwastewater  is  a  minimum  requirement  for  all  cities.  It  is  expected  that  providing  wastewater \ntreatment to counties will substantially reduce pollutant loads entering rivers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRiver Improvement \n\n10. \nThe Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for managing water resources in the PRC, \nwhich  includes  river  improvement  and  flood  control.  The  flood-control  system  includes  structural \nmeasures  to  reduce  flood  hazards\u2014dikes  levees,  dams,  and  improved  channel  conveyance \ncapacity  by  widening,  deepening,  realignment,  and  bank  protection\u2014as  well  as  other  flood \nmeasures such as land-use controls, early warning systems, and flood response plans. The Hebei \nProvince  11th  FYP  (2006\u20132010)  upgrades  the  standard  for  flood  control  from  a  20-year  return \nperiod to a 50-year period. Municipal bureaus of water affairs are responsible for rivers and river \nchannels  in  their  jurisdiction,  including  urban  flood  control.  Rivers  are  often  seasonal,  as  70%  of \nannual rainfall occurs from June to September in most areas, and channel beds are often littered \nwith  solid  waste,  filled  with  sediment,  and  polluted  by  untreated  wastewater.  River  improvement \nprojects undertaken by local governments in this province aim to reshape the river channel, install \nembankments,  and  install  riverbank  landscaping  that  includes  walkways,  trees,  shrubs,  and \nvegetation.  A  more  integrated  approach  to  river  improvement,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid \nwaste  management  has  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  address  the  long-term \nsustainability of project facilities. Further, community involvement in river cleanup and maintenance \nand solid waste management improvement will be institutionalized to assist county governments in \nensuring that flood-protection measures and facilities are sustained. \n \n\n3. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n11. \nThe  Chinese  Environmental  Science  Institute  estimates  solid  waste  generation  in  small \ncities at 1.0\u20131.3 kilograms per capita per day. About 48% of all solid waste collected in prefecture-\nlevel  cities  in  Hebei  is  deposited  in  sanitary  landfills  and/or  treated  in  composting  and  recycling \n\n                                                 \n3   Hebei Province, Urbanization 11th FYP. Site visits found water supply coverage fairly limited and unreliable, with most \n\nhouseholds and industries extracting groundwater. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n30 \n \nfacilities (footnote 2). As provincial agencies do not regularly monitor the performance of the sector, \nno  detailed  technical  or  financial  information  is  available  regarding  investment,  collection, \ntreatment, use of recycling, etc. Nationally the State Council, Ministry of Construction, and Ministry \nof  the  Environment  set  policies  and  provide  guidelines.  Provincially,  province  construction \ndepartments,  development  and  reform  commissions,  and  environmental  protection  bureaus  set \nplans  and  guidelines  for  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  activities,  with  construction  bureaus \nundertaking  the  design,  construction,  and  commissioning  of  such  MSW  facilities  as  landfills. \nMunicipal governments fund solid waste management with capital funding and operating budgets. \nMany small cities and towns have not established a user-pays tariff system but finance solid waste \ncollection and treatment through general revenues. Some counties offset costs by selling recycled \nmaterials  such  as  plastic  and  glass  and  by  making  fertilizer  from  composted  MSW.4 The  main \nmunicipal solid waste and sanitation problems are (i) incomplete coverage of solid waste collection \nservices and public toilets; (ii) unclear standards and routes for waste collection and transfer; (iii) \ntoilets;  (v)  waste \ninsufficient  waste  storage \ntransportation characterized by low mechanization, efficiency, and safety; (vi) unsanitary disposal \nof  collected  waste;  (vii)  no  processing  or  treatment  of  collected  waste;  and  (viii)  no  reuse  or \nrecycling of waste. To improve living conditions, improved solid waste management services will be \nprovided through better collection and transfer of solid waste and the introduction of recycling and \ncomposting  to  dispose  of  wastes.  This  intervention  will  enable  cleaner  counties  to  promote \neconomic development and employment generation through tourism and services.  \n \n\nfacilities;  (iv)  absence  of  water-flush  public \n\n4. \n\nDistrict Heating \n\n12. \nIn many parts of northern PRC, district heating systems that exploit surplus heat generated \nfrom  power  stations  are  replacing  local  coal-fired  boilers.  This  reduces  coal  consumption, \nemissions of greenhouse gases, and air pollution from particulates and coal dust. Although existing \nsystems are fixed flow (neither adjustable nor metered in dwelling units), PRC requires individual \nmeasuring  equipment  to  be  installed  in  existing  systems  by  2010  and  all  new  buildings  to  have \nmetered  heating.  Heat  customers  currently  pay  on  the  basis  of  how  many  square  meters  are \nheated. The benefits of centralized heating improvements for greenhouse gas emissions is greater \nwhen new heating services are combined with new natural gas services. This allows residents to \nswitch  from  coal-burning  stoves  to  less  polluting  technology  for  home  heating  and  cooking.  An \nintegrated approach to energy improvements should be adopted as part of municipal infrastructure \nplanning. District heating will improve energy efficiency by eliminating small and inefficient boilers \nand  reducing  coal  use,  which  will  improve  air  quality  indoors  and  out,  to  the  benefit  of  human \nhealth. Centralizing coal use will also centralize the storage of bottom ash to facilitate its reuse in \nbuilding and paving materials. \n \n\n5. \n\nConclusion \n\nNational  and  provincial  policy  frameworks  clearly  posit  towns  as  engines  of  urban  growth \n13. \nand  embrace  a  number  of  best  practices  for  urban  infrastructure  delivery:  demand  management, \ncost recovery pricing, and treatment of solid waste and wastewater. However, these policies have \nyet  to  be  put  in  practice  provincially  by  implementing  regulations  or  performance  management \nsystems.  The  proposed  Project,  under  the  Hebei  project  management  office,  can  become  the \nstimulus  for  operationalizing  town  development  policy  by  (i)  formulating  specific  approaches  to \npromoting  town  development  and  testing  them  through  subprojects,  (ii)  rolling  out  those \napproaches  to  other  towns,  and  (iii)  setting  specific  benchmarks  and  monitoring  systems  for  the \nfurther development of the sector in Hebei Province. \n                                                 \n4   An  assessment  of  the  solid  waste  composition  shows  a  high  percentage  of  organic  matter  (46%),  followed  by  inert \nmatter (44%), and recyclables (about 10%). The carbon and nitrogen ratio ranges from 20 to 30, indicating suitability \nfor composting. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nPROCESS FOR SUBPROJECT IDENTIFICATION, SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND \nAPPRAISAL \n \n\nfor  (i) \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nUnder  the  sector  loan  approach,  the  Hebei  provincial  government  (HPG)  has,  as  the \n1. \nExecuting  Agency,  established  a \nidentifying  and  selecting, \nthree-stage  approach \n(ii) preparing,  and  (iii)  appraising  subprojects  for  inclusion  in  the  Hebei  Small  Cities  and  Towns \nDevelopment Demonstration Sector Project (the Project). These procedures are currently used to \nselect and prepare subsequent subprojects. HPG has delegated various actions and decisions with \nrespect  to  subproject  processing  to  the  Hebei  project  management  office  (PMO),  located  in  the \nHebei Finance Bureau. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nHPG  has  invited  county-level  city  and  county  governments  in  Hebei  Province  to  express \ntheir interest in participating in the Project, which will be partly financed by an Asian Development \nBank (ADB) loan. The following criteria will be used to identify and select subprojects: \n \n\nStage 1: Subproject Identification and Selection \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nThe  subproject  must  be  urban  development,  i.e.,  for  the  physical  development  of \nsmall cities and towns, with particular emphasis on infrastructure development. The \neligible  subsectors  for  subproject  investment  are  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, river improvement, solid waste management, and district heating. \nThe proposed subproject city or town must be a county-level city or county or town.  \nThe  subproject  must  improve  living  conditions  and/or  enable  the  promotion  of \ninvestment that will generate employment, as follows: \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\ninvestment \n\nimproving  living  conditions  by  accomplishing  at  least  one  of  the  following: \n(1) cleaning  up  polluted  urban  areas,  (2)  reducing  or  slowing  the  rate  of \nincrease of water, land, and/or air pollution in urban areas, (3) treating solid \nwaste  or  wastewater  prior  to  discharge  into  the  environment,  and/or  (4) \nimproving  the  environmental  sustainability  of  town  development  through \nmore ecologically sensitive infrastructure services; and/or \ngenerating  employment  by  accomplishing  at  least  one  of  the  following:  (1) \nincluding \nfacilitating \nservices;  (2)  removing  a  specific  infrastructure-related  barrier  to  further \ngrowth  of  an  economic  sector  in  the  city  or  town,  or  enabling  economic \ngrowth through infrastructure service provision; (3) enabling the development \nof residential or mixed-use areas for staff of new or expanding businesses by \nproviding water supply and urban environmental services for new expansion \nareas;  (4)  strengthening  linkages  of  the  city  or  town  economy  with  a \nmetropolitan  or  subregional  economy,  including  growth  corridors  and \nclusters;  and/or  (5)  improving  access  for  the  urban  poor  to  economic \nopportunities. \n\nlabor-intensive  economic  sectors, \n\nin \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe local government must confirm its ability and willingness to arrange counterpart \nfinance. \nThe local government must confirm its willingness for the subproject to comply with \nADB safeguard policies and other requirements. \nThe preferred implementation period must be during 2009\u20132015. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nStage 2: Subproject Preparation \n\nStage 3: Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n\nLocal  governments  can  contract  local  design  and  other  specialist  institutes  to  carry  out \n\nC. \n \n3. \nPreparation by local governments involves designating an implementing agency (or initially \nan office of the government) to prepare project design documents including a project proposal and \nfeasibility  study  report  under  the  guidance  of  the  Hebei  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n(HDRC); with the help of the Hebei PMO, an environmental impact assessment, and (if required) a \nresettlement  plan  to  standards  necessary  to  meet  both  domestic  and  ADB  requirements. \nGovernments  must  determine  suitable  institutional  arrangements  for  project  implementation  and \nprepare a detailed financing plan. \n \n4. \nselected tasks involved in subproject preparation, including report production. \n \nTo facilitate an orderly and consistent appraisal of the subprojects, the Hebei PMO requires \n5. \nan  integrated  feasibility  study  in  a  common  format  to  be  prepared  to  ADB  standards  for  each \nproposed subproject, including technical, social, financial, economic, and institutional analyses. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe ADB project team developed a detailed set of evaluation criteria, which was discussed \nand  agreed  with  HPG.  This  is  to  ensure  that  appraisal  of  individual  subprojects  is  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB  standards.  The  appraisal  of  the  three  core  subprojects  will  also  serve  as \nguidance for the appraisal of subsequent subprojects. \n \n7. \nEach  subsequent  subproject  PMO  will  prepare  a  subproject  appraisal  report,  which  will \nfollow  the  template  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C  (which  also  shows  the  summary \nappraisal criteria), and submit it to the municipal finance bureau for review and then to the Hebei \nPMO for review. The Hebei PMO will submit the appraisal report to the Hebei Finance Bureau and \nHDRC for endorsement. \n \n8. \nRejected subprojects are to be referred to the relevant local governments with indications of \nwhere the preparations and proposals are deficient, and for additional preparation work (assuming \nthe subprojects have a realistic chance of meeting the agreed evaluation criteria). \n \n9. \n \n10. \n \n\nSubprojects approved by HDRC will be forwarded to ADB for approval. \n\nAll subproject approvals by ADB or HPG will only be made if: \n\nincludes  an  environmental \n\nthe  subproject \nimpact  assessment  which  has \nincorporated ADB\u2019s comments, and has been subject to relevant public consultation \nand disclosure; and \na resettlement plan, meeting ADB requirements, has been prepared and approved \nby the relevant local government, and endorsed as satisfactory by ADB. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n

WASTEWATER UTILITIES \n\nObjectives \n\nA. \n \n1. \nTo enhance the sustainability of water supply and wastewater infrastructure financed by the \nAsian  Development  Bank,  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership \nFacility  will  provide  a  grant  to  be  used  to  strengthen  the  institutional  and  financial  management \ncapacity  of  the  entities  involved  in  planning,  financing,  implementing,  managing,  operating,  and \nmaintaining water and wastewater systems in the subproject small cities and towns. This includes \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  service  providers participating  in  core  and  subsequent  subprojects. \nThe  assistance,  to  be  executed  by  the  Hebei  provincial  government,  will  focus  on  improving  the \nprovincial policy and regulatory framework for these providers and, where appropriate, the national \nframework.  The capacity development assistance will improve the ability of water and wastewater \nservice  providers  to  respond  to  ongoing  urbanization  challenges  by  enhancing  their  ability  to \ndeliver sustainable services. Specifically it will    \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nhelp participating entities develop a comprehensive corporate strategy for water and \nwastewater  service  provision  in  which  organization  structures,  personnel,  and \nsystems and procedures are aligned with corporate goals and objectives;  \nadopt  a  demand-driven  approach  for  service  delivery,  in  which  service  levels  and \ncoverage for water and wastewater are set and interventions designed in response \nto the expressed priorities and preferences of end users; and \nstrengthen financial management and cost recovery so that revenues cover costs to \nthe extent possible, and the service provider is able to meet its substantial financial \nobligations in an environment of rapidly expanding service provision. \ndevelop  service  and  operational  guidelines  for  financial  and  organizational  reform \nthat  can  be  applied  by  the  water  and  wastewater  treatment  service  providers  in \nHebei province, including those not participating in the Project. \n\nScope of Work \n\n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  team  implementing  the  capacity  development  assistance  will  assess  the  institutional \nand  financial  capacity  of  the  designated  service  providers;  formulate  a  program  to  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  including  training,  assistance  with  corporate  reform,  improvement  of \nadministrative  systems  and  procedures,  and  design  of  pilot  interventions;  and  assist  in \nimplementing  the  program.  The  team  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  office  and  work  closely  with  subproject  management  offices  and  implementing \nagencies.  The  Hebei  provincial  government  will,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  be  responsible  for \nexecuting the grant and recruiting consultants. \n \nC. \n \n3. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nInternational  consultants  will  be  (i)  an  operation  and  institutional  specialist  and  (ii)  a \nfinancial  management  specialist.  National  consultants  will  be  a  (i)  team  leader  and  financial \nspecialist, (ii) utility accountant, (iii) water and wastewater pricing specialist, (iv) training specialist, \nand (v) customer outreach specialist. \n \n\nThe work will be carried out over 12 months commencing in mid-2010. \n\nPeriod of Performance \n\nStaffing \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\n  \n\nItem \nA.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nSmall cities and towns in Hebei Province have made substantial progress in recent years in facilitating economic growth. In high-\ngrowth towns, industrial development has outstripped infrastructure provision and urban management capacity. Coverage rates \nfor  urban  environmental  services  are  inadequate,  and  pollution  levels  are  high.  Many  areas  of  the  province  suffer  bad  air  and \nwater  pollution,  creating  serious  threats  to  human  health.  The  objectives  of  the  Hebei  Small  Cities  and  Towns  Development \nDemonstration  Sector  Project  (the  Project)  are  to  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization;  narrow  the \nurban-rural income gap; and improve production, employment, and living conditions in small cities and towns in Hebei Province. \nAlthough the Project will not reduce poverty directly, it will contribute in the short and long term to poverty reduction. The Project \nis in line with the PRC national poverty reduction strategy for developing the region, which aims to narrow the urban\u2013rural income \ngap,  and  supports  Hebei\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  2006\u20132010  to  promote  sustainable  economic  development  with  water \nsupply and environmental improvement. It is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  water policy that people must \nhave  access  to  safe  and  reliable  water  supplies,  and  it  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  of \nenvironmental sustainability (MDG 7) and specifically address MDG target 7.C: halve the proportion of people without sustainable \naccess  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015. The  Project  adheres  to  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategya  in  the \nPRC  to  make  markets  work  more  efficiently  through  (i)  urban  infrastructure  development;  (ii)  the  promotion  of  environmental \nsustainability; and (iii) pro-poor, equitable, and inclusive growth.  \n \nThe Project will improve water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, heating, and river control, which will reduce surface \nand groundwater pollution, safeguard the environment and public health, and improve the quality of life of local residents in 10 \nsmall cities and towns of Hebei Province. The Project will benefit 623,000 residents, including the 3% of people living below the \nlocal poverty line, in the three core subproject cities and towns of Bazhou, Zhaoxian, and Zhengding and about 600,000 residents \nin  seven  subsequent  subproject  cities  and  towns.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  reducing  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases  and  flood  risks  in  small  cities  and  towns,  providing  employment  opportunities  during  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  project  facilities,  with  anticipated  flow-on  benefits  to  social  and  economic  development.  Specific \nanticipated benefits include the following:  \n\na. Create  jobs  and  employment  opportunities. The Project will generate 1,585 person-years of work, including 1,325 jobs \nduring construction and 260 jobs during operation. Follow-on multiplier effects are expected to indirectly create an additional \n2,536  jobs.  Sixty  percent  of  the  construction  jobs  are  assumed  to  be  unskilled.  The  loan  assurances  specifically  address \nemploying the poor, women, and ethnic minorities, which will contribute to narrowing income gaps and to poverty reduction.  \nb. Improvement  of  residents\u2019  quality  of  life.  After  the  Project  is  completed,  the  infrastructure  in  project  areas  will  be \nimproved greatly, and so will local residents\u2019 living environment and quality of life. Water and sanitation improvements will \nimprove health and significantly reduce time burdens, particularly for women. Heating improvements will improve the quality \nof life and mitigate health issues related to home heating fuels. The Project will improve the treatment of wastewater before \ndischarging it into the environment and introduce sanitary practices in solid waste collection and treatment. \n\nc. Improve  health  conditions.  The  components  are  expected  to  provide  clean  drinking  water  and  better  environmental \nconditions.  As  a  result,  exposure  of  the  population  to  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases  and  related  medical  costs  will \ndecrease, along with the number of schooldays and workdays lost to sickness. The health impact analysis shows that the \nProject  will  bring  reductions  in  medical  costs  incurred  from  contracting  waterborne  diseases  in  small  cities  and  towns \namounting  to  CNY9.17  million  in  2012\u20132020.  Health  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  disproportionately  to  women  since \nthey  are  more  vulnerable  to  waterborne  diseases  because  of  their  greater  contact  with  water  when  doing  household \nchores,  especially  cooking  and  washing,  and  with  sick  children  and  old  people.  Total  savings  to  households  over  2012\u2013\n2020 are estimated at CNY2.75 million. Detailed analysis of health impacts is provided in Supplementary Appendix P. The \npoor will benefit more than most people from improved environmental quality and health benefits as a result of their higher \nvulnerability to poor environmental conditions. \n\nThis poverty reduction and social strategy will be applied in the subsequent subproject cities and towns, where social conditions \nare anticipated to be similar to those in the core subproject towns. Details of the social aspects of subsequent subprojects will be \npresented  in  the  subproject  appraisal  reports  to  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  during  implementation.  The  subproject \nappraisal criteria and report template is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11          49   \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                   Targeting Classification: TI \u2013 MDG 7 Target 7.C \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nHebei Province is in northeastern PRC and has a land area of 187,693 square kilometers (km2), with the Bohai Sea to the east. \nIts population is 69.4 million, with an average household size of 3.3 in 2006. Han Chinese account for 96%, and the remaining \n4%  belong  to  the  Man,  Hui,  Mongol,  and  other  minorities.  Hebei\u2019s  economy  is  dynamic  and  diverse,  spanning  heavy  industry \n(construction materials, steel, and pharmaceuticals), light industry (textiles and agroprocessing), and resource extraction (coal). \nUrbanization in Hebei has been rapid. The urban population of Hebei is 38% and expected to rise to 50% by 2010. Small cities \nand towns are rapidly absorbing rural migrants, driving up urbanization across the province.  \n \nUnlike  the  rural  poverty  definition,  the  urban  poverty  line  in  the  PRC  is  not  defined  to  a  uniform  standard.  In  general,  urban \nresidents that live under the minimum living standard scheme (MLSS)b are defined as urban poor. MLSS eligibility varies from \ncity  to  city  and  county  to  county.  In  2007  the  poor  population  of  Hebei\u2014those  living  under  the  MLSS\u2014was  0.89  million.  The \nurban poverty incidence is 3.4%. There are 11,104 people, or 2.8% of the urban population, who benefit from this subsidy. The \nurban  poverty  incidence  in  Bazhou  is  2.3%,  in  Zhaoxian  6.1%,  and  in  Zhengding  1.4%.  The  socioeconomic  survey  and  focus \ngroup  discussions  indicate  that  most  of  the  poor  in  the  subproject  areas  are  unemployed  workers,  disabled  people,  and  the \nchronically  ill.  Details  are  available  in  Supplementary  Appendix  N.  Hebei  Province  has  a  relatively  high  rate  of  rural  poverty. \nFifty-two  poor  counties  have  been  officially  identified,  of  which  40  are  nationally  designated  and  12  provincially  designated.c \nThere are two types of rural poor in Hebei. One is those officially identified by the central Poverty Reduction Office and the other \nis the rural poor living under the rural MLSSd defined by the Hebei government, which started its rural MLSS in 2005. The people \nwhose income is below the rural MLSS can receive the subsidy from CNY700\u2013CNY1,200.  \n \nThe percentage of the provincial population in absolute poverty, with annual per capita annual income of <CNY785, is 4.5%, or \nalmost double the national average of 2.5%. When the number of relative poor, those with annual per capita income of CNY785 \nto  CNY1,067,  is  taken  into  account,  the  percentage  in  poverty  rises  to  9.6%,  compared  with  a  national  average  of  6.8%.  The \nrural  poor  in  Hebei  living  under  the  rural  MLSS  numbered  1.56  million  in  2007  (3.7%).  In  2006,  the  three  core  subproject \ncounties  had  a  rural  population  of  1.2  million,  of  which  6.9%  lived  below  the  old  poverty  line  of  CNY1,067/month.  The  rural \npoverty  incidence  of  Bazhou  is  4.7%,  of  Zhaoxian  8.3%,  and  of  Zhengding  7.2%;  and  1.9%  lived  below  the  threshold  of  the \nMLSS (CNY800/month\u2013CNY1,200/month). MLSS targeting in Bazhou is 2.2%, in Zhaoxian 1.0%, and in Zhengding 2.8%. \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe project design addresses the social dimensions of poverty, participation, gender, ethic minority, etc. Project assurances call \nfor employing local labor, with 30% of the labor opportunities to be provided to the poor and women. Participation strategies and \nprograms  use  a  community-based  public  education  and  awareness  program  (PEAP),  community  monitoring  teams  during \nimplementation, and community management committees during the operation of the new infrastructure.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nStakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  poverty  and  social  assessment.  Various  methods  and  approaches  were \nemployed,  including  participatory  rural  assessment,  a  socioeconomic  sample  survey  of  400  households,  four  stakeholder \nconsultation  meetings  and  workshops,  15  focus  group  discussions,  and  14  key  informant  interviews.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment identified vulnerable groups and opportunities for pro-poor interventions and recommended social action measures \nand  participation  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  social  benefits.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicates  that  rapid \nurbanization confronts Hebei Province with such development issues as the inadequate availability of public services for growing \npopulations and severe air, river, groundwater, and solid waste pollution. The Project aims to address these issues and meet the \ndemands of the residents by improving water supply, wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment, heating systems, and \nriver management. The main findings of the social analysis for three core subprojects are as follows:  \n \nBazhou is located on the north of the Hebei Plain  with a geographic spread of nearly  784 km2 and a  population of 577,000 in \n2006.  Shengfang  County,  under  the  jurisdiction  of  Bazhou  City,  consists  of  39  villages.  It  is  the  largest  producer  of  steel  and \nwood furniture in the country. The area of the urban center is expected to increase from the current 15 km2 with the development \nof new residential and industrial areas, to 29 km2 in the short term and 54 km2 in the long term. Accordingly, the urban population \nis expected to increase from the current 88,000 to 196,000 in 2010. Rapid urbanization and industrialization in Bazhou City and \nShengfang County, however, have damaged the environment. Investments in urban environmental infrastructure have not kept \npace  with  the  growth  of  urban  population  and  industries.  In  Shengfang,  inadequate  water  supply  is  a  main  concern  of  the \nresidents and local government. Bazhou City has a combined drainage system that directly discharges into the Mangniu River, \ncausing groundwater pollution.  \n \nZhengding County has a land area of 469 km2 and a population 442,788. It is located at the eastern foot of Taihang Mountain, in \nsouthwest Hebei Province, north of the city of Shijiazhuang. In the 11th FYP and social development plan of Shijiazhuang City, \nZhengding County is designated as the base for the textile and garment industry. As existing sanitation facilities such as public \n\n \n\n\f50          Appendix 11           \n\ntoilets  and  waste  storage  are  inadequate,  the  solid  waste  component  will  promote  safe  and  hygienic  disposal  of  solid  waste, \nreducing the risk of disease associated with an unhygienic environment as well as waterborne disease.  \n \nZhaoxian  County,  under  the  jurisdiction  of  Shijiazhuang  City,  is  in  south-central  Hebei.  It  has  a  land  area  of  675  km2  and  a \npopulation  of  568,107.  It  is  basically  an  agricultural  town,  with  525  km2,  or  78%  of  its  area,  devoted  to  agriculture.  Its  main \nagricultural products are  wheat, pears, apples, peaches, and grapes. As Zhaoxian continues to urbanize, living standards rise \nand  improving  environmental  conditions  becomes  a  priority.  Heating  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste  collection \npose major development constraints. The proposed subproject aims to improve the water resource situation, living conditions of \nresidents, and physical environment of the urban area of Zhaoxian County, as well as the surrounding areas of Shijiazhuang.  \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \n \n1. The major stakeholders included were (i) groups directly affected by the project in a positive or negative way, including men, \nwomen,  elderly,  poor,  minority  people,  and  related  schools,  businesses,  and  organizations;  and  (ii)  government  organizations \nsuch  as  the  Executing  Agency,  implementing  agencies,  Planning  and  Reform  Commission,  Civil  Affairs  Bureau,  Poverty \nAlleviation  Office,  Women\u2019s  Federation,  Minority  Affairs  Office,  Finance  Bureau,  Health  Bureau,  Labor  and  Social  Security \nBureau,  and  Environmental  Protection  Bureau.  Several  meetings  with  a  number  of  stakeholders,  especially  vulnerable  groups \nincluding  women,  poor  and  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  areas,  have  been  organized  in  the  subproject  cities.  In  addition,  a \nnumber  of  key  informant  interviews  were  held  with  various  bureaus,  nongovernment  organizations,  women\u2019s  federations,  and \nparticipants in past and ongoing projects in complementary areas. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n Collaborative decision making \n\n Information sharing \n\n Empowerment \n\n Consultation \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nPEAP  will  be  conducted  to  promote  hygiene  education,  recycling  programs,  and  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.  The \nfollowing  results  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through  the  PEAP:  (i)  increased  participation  of  the  local  population  in  project \nimplementation and monitoring, (ii) increased awareness of project benefits and acceptance of the project, (iii) improved hygiene \nknowledge and reduced incidence of waterborne disease, and (iv) increased participation of beneficiaries in garbage recycling as \npart of solid waste management program. Public disclosure of all subproject documents will be made at the project management \noffice  (PMO)  and  on  the  ADB  website,  including  the  project  information  document,  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nresettlement plans, summary environmental impact assessment, environmental management plan, and social and environmental \nmonitoring reports. A project information document has been prepared. Booklets outlining the resettlement plans were distributed \nto  affected  households,  and  disclosure  meetings  were  held.  Copies  of  the  booklet  are  available  at  PMOs  and  each  affected \nvillage office. \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nIn  subproject  areas,  women  made  up  49.8%  of  the  population  in  2006.  Employed  women  made  up  46%  of  the  employed \npopulation. Most project benefits accruing to the three towns will benefit men and women equally, including economic development, \nimproved housing conditions and living environment, health benefits, and job creation. The Project will have some added benefits for \nwomen, as they are primarily responsible for collecting drinking water, disposing of wastewater, cleaning houses, nursing children, \nand caring for the sick and the elderly. \n \n2. Key Actions  \nA target has been set of about 30% of jobs for the poor and women in the operation and maintenance of infrastructure, and an \nassurance from the PMOs to encourage contractors to hire as much female construction labor as possible has been approved. \nConstruction  projects  usually  provide  opportunities  for  vendors  to  carry  out  informal  trading  like  selling  drinks  and  snacks  to \nconstruction  workers.  This  is  likely  to  be  an  additional  temporary  source  of  income  that  women  can  tap  during  construction. \nWomen in the community will be actively engaged by the PEAP to promote hygiene education, garbage recycling programs, and \nsocial acceptance of tariff increases. For the PEAP, the Project will work closely with local women\u2019s organizations such as the All \nChinese Women Association and women\u2019s street committees. The project performance management system, resettlement plan, \nand environmental management plan will include gender-disaggregated data where relevant. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n Significant \n\n \n\nThree short resettlement plans have been prepared and \nendorsed  by  local  governments  and  must  be  approved \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included \nin Design \n\n Full plane  \n Short Plan \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11          51   \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nEmployment \nopportunities \n Labor \nretrenchment \n Core labor \nstandards  \n\n \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nfor \n\nloan  appraisal.

Manila. \nb  In 2006, the MLSS ceiling was CNY155 per capita per month in Zhengding and Zhaoxian and CNY255 in Bazhou. \nc  In 2002, nationally and provincially identified impoverished counties were determined by the results of three indexes: per capita \nannual  net  income  (weight  6),  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (weight  3),  and  per  capita  fiscal  income  (weight  1).  The  40 \nlowest-scoring counties are categorized as national poverty counties and following 12 counties are provincial poverty counties. \n\nd  MLSS is designated on the basis of the counties\u2019 socioeconomic condition, ranging from CNY700\u2013CNY1,200. \ne  Three full resettlement plans and one short resettlement plan have been prepared for the three core subprojects. There are one \nfull  resettlement  plan  and  one  short  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  Bazhou  subproject  and  full  resettlement  plans  for  the \nMangniu River improvement and sewer network rehabilitation component and Zhengding solid waste component. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52          Appendix 12           \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe Hebei Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector Project (the Project) \nis composed of three core subprojects and about seven subsequent subprojects to be determined. \nAll 10 proposed subprojects are currently under preparation and require some land acquisition and \nresettlement.  Resettlement  planning  and  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  affected \npeople will be better off or at least not worse off as a result of the Project. The land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts of the Project will be significant. Three full resettlement plans and one short \nresettlement  plan  have  been  prepared  for  the  three  core  subprojects.  There  are  one  full \nresettlement plan and one short resettlement plan for the Bazhou subproject and full resettlement \nplans  for  the  Mangniu  River  improvement  and  sewer  network  rehabilitation  component  and \nZhengding solid waste component. \n \nThe  scope  of  the  Project  impact  is  determined  mainly  by  the  results  of  the  measurement \n2. \nsurveys as part of the feasibility study reports. The physical and economic displacements identified \nshow  that  the  construction  of  the  three  core  subprojects  will  affect  37  households  or  196  people \nwith  permanent  land  acquisition,  30  households  or  137  people  with  the  demolition  of  residential \nstructures, and four small shops with 13 employees. In total, 173 mu, or 11.5 hectares (ha), of land \nwill  be  acquired  permanently,  162  mu,  or  10.8  ha,  of  which  is  cultivated  land.  Along  with  land \nacquisition,  582  square  meters  (m2)  of  residences  and  624  m2  of  other  buildings  will  be \ndemolished,  affecting  30  households  and  137  people  and  relocating  four  small  shops  with  13 \nemployees. In addition, associated productive assets, ground attachments, and basic infrastructure \nand  facilities  will  also  be  affected.  Tables  A12.1  and  A12.2  summarize  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts identified. \n \nThe resettlement plan and compensation for permanent land loss is based on Document 28: \n3. \nState  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  of  October \n2004, the Land Administration Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China of 1998 (updated in 2004), \nand  the  Hebei  Provincial  Implementation  Regulation  of  Land  Administration  Law  of  1999.  The \nresettlement plan and compensation for demolished buildings is based on national, provincial, and \nmunicipal  urban  housing  administration  regulations.  Consultations  with  local  governments  and \naffected people and general practice in Zhengding, Zhaoxian, and Bazhou guided the adoption of a \nset  of  compensation  standards  by  city  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing \nagencies (IAs).  \n\n \nTable A12.1: Summary of Land Acquisition \n\nPermanent Land Acquisition \n\nTotal Area (mu)  \n\nOf which Farmland (mu) \n\nAffected Households \n\nAffected People \n\nSubproject \nBazhou City \nZhaoxian \nCounty \nZhengding \nCounty \n\nTotal \n\n0.00 \n\n104.41 \n\n68.48 \n\n172.89 \n\n0.00 \n\n93.81 \n\n68.48 \n\n162.29 \n\nNote: 15 mu is equivalent to 1 hectare.

On  various  occasions  during  meetings, \ninterviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation \nmeetings,  local  representatives  have  participated  in  planning,  and  their  concerns  have  been \nintegrated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  information  booklet  for  each  subproject \nwas  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  households  in  August  2008.  The  resettlement  plans  has \nbeen provided to village offices and resident committees and posted on the ADB website. Project \nIAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  to  supervise  implementation,  continue  public \nconsultation, monitor progress, and respond to grievances. Procedures to address grievances are \nwell established, and explanations are included in the resettlement information booklets. \n \n5. \nFor land acquisition, a portion of the land compensation fee will be used for creating village \ninfrastructure. Resettlement subsidies will be paid to affected people. Compensation for residences \nand other buildings to be demolished will be paid to owners, including those without building title. \nThe payment will be made in cash according to the appraised value of the property. Households \nthat  have  to  relocate  will  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops, \nauxiliaries, and other assets will be paid directly to affected people. Income losses resulting from \nreduced production, sales, or wages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \n6. \nThe resettlement strategy encompasses the replacement of housing and the restoration of \nlivelihoods  and  income.  For  people  losing  housing  in  rural  areas,  there  are  two  compensation \noptions: cash compensation alone or cash compensation plus the provision of a plot on which the \naffected  people  can  construct  a  house  themselves.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  constructing \nnew  houses  or  finding  available  housing  close  to  the  original  homes,  when  preferred  by  the \naffected people. Municipal PMOs, IAs, and local governments will provide necessary assistance for \nhouse construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. \n \n7. \nMunicipal  PMOs  and  IAs  will  establish  a  special  fund  for  vulnerable  people.  Vulnerable \nhouseholds will receive additional assistance from municipal or county civil affairs bureaus. PMOs \nand  IAs  will  supervise  implementation  to  ensure  that  vulnerable  people  receive  adequate \ncompensation,  housing  arrangements,  and  special  funds special  assistance  to  restore  their  living \nconditions and incomes. \n \n8. \nEach PMO and IA will have at least one full-time staffer responsible for land acquisition and \nat least one other staffer responsible for resettlement. Staff from each subproject resettlement unit \nwill take lead responsibility for coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring \nof land acquisition and resettlement. The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $6.3 \nmillion,  equivalent  to  CNY36.21  million,  in  2008  prices,  including  contingencies.  Resettlement \nimplementation will be completed prior to subproject construction. Following detailed measurement \nsurveys,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval. \nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. Monitoring \nmethodologies are specified in the resettlement plans. Internal supervision and monitoring will be \ndone  by  each  IA  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  Hebei \nPMO and IAs have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with ADB to ensure the timely  and \neffective implementation of resettlement. External monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by \nan independent agency under contract to the Hebei PMO and IAs. External monitoring reports will \nbe forwarded directly to both the Hebei PMO and ADB. \n\n \n\n\f54          Appendix 13           \n\n \nA. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Revenue-Generating Components \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  Hebei  Small  Cities  and  Towns  Development  Demonstration \nSector  Project  (the  Project)  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) procedures for the financial management and analysis of projects.1 The revenue-generating \ncomponents  included  in  the  core  subprojects  are  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  district \nheating, and solid waste management (SWM). \n \n2. \nMethodology.  The  financial  analysis  assessed  the  ability  of  the  subprojects  to  generate \nsufficient revenues from operations to meet all costs, including operation and maintenance (O&M), \ndepreciation  and/or  debt  servicing,  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on  investment.  The  analysis \nincorporated  the  required  tariff  increases  and  compared  them  with  household  affordability.  The \nbase case financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was compared with the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of changes on costs and \nrevenues.  Financial  projections  (balance  sheet,  income,  and  cash  flow  statements)  have  been \ndeveloped for the proposed water supply, wastewater, heating, and solid waste components based \non their projected operational performance. The financial analysis is based on existing operations \nand the incremental cash flow impacts of the proposed subprojects.  \n  \n3. \nAssumptions.  All  analysis  was  conducted  in  constant  November  2008  prices.  The  FIRR \nwas calculated using incremental annual cash flows over 25 years with no residual value. Project \ncapital  expenditures  are  estimated  based  on  the  proposed  implementation  schedule  and  include \nphysical  contingencies.  O&M  costs  include  only  incremental  costs  incurred  under  the  Project. \nRevenues  are  calculated  based  on  projected  production  and  consumption  volumes  for  water \nsupply and wastewater, proposed tariffs, and collection efficiency. \n  \nTariffs.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  tariffs2 will  be  increased  gradually  to  full  cost  recovery \n4. \nlevels to cover O&M, depreciation, and/or debt service with the Project improving service delivery. \nThe  Government  agrees  to  gradual  tariff  increase  (Table  A13.1).  During  implementation,  the \nweighted  average  tariff  for  solid  waste  treatment  in  Zhengding  is  CNY1.10/household/month  and \nthe  level  of  cost  recovery3 is  around  98%.  Full  cost  recovery  will  be  achieved  after  1  year  of \noperation.  The  weighted  average  tariff  for  solid  waste  in  Zhaoxian  is  CNY1.44/household/month, \nand cost recovery is about 92% during project implementation. Full cost recovery will be achieved \nafter 5 years of operation. The weighted average tariff for heating in Zhaoxian is CNY9.88/square \nmeter (m2)/month. Full cost recovery will be achieved within 3 years of operations. The weighted \naverage  tariff  for  wastewater  in  Zhaoxian  is  CNY0.35/cubic  meter  (m3).  Full  cost  recovery  will  be \nachieved  after  3 years  of  operation.  The  weighted  average  tariff  for  Bazhou  water  supply  is \nCNY2.57/m3 during project implementation, and full cost recovery is achieved once it is operational.  \n \n5. \nAffordability  Analysis.  The  calculated  full  cost  recovery  tariffs  are  calibrated  against  the \naffordability  of  the  urban  poor,  with  tariff  estimates  based  on  the  proposals  to  introduce  full  cost \nrecovery charging by 2012. Proposed average tariffs are calculated using the principle of full O&M, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Handbook for Borrowers on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2   Current weighted average tariffs in Zhaoxian are as follows: solid waste CNY1/person/month; heating CNY4.4/square \nmeter/month;  wastewater  CNY0.34/cubic  meter.  In  Zhengding,  solid  waste  is  CNY3/household/month  for  local \nresidents and Bazhou water is CNY2.57/cubic meter.   \n\n3   Cost recovery refers to tariffs being able to cover operating costs and debt service costs. Full cost recovery (100% and \n\nabove) occurs when all costs, including operating costs, debt service, and depreciation, are recovered. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13          55   \n\ndepreciation, and financing cost recovery.4 The household charge for combined water, solid waste, \nwastewater,  and  heating  services  satisfies  ADB  criteria  of  a  maximum  of  about  5%  of  average \nhousehold income. Affordability of SWM services is assumed to be 1% of the monthly household \nincome. Current SWM fees are low at CNY1\u2013CNY1.4/household/month, which is not adequate to \ncover  SWM  costs  and  to  increase  revenues,  recycling  and  compost  fertilizer  production  will  be \nundertaken.  Households  with  incomes  below  the  poverty  line  and  the  unemployed  are  provided \nwith basic services based on minimum living standard scheme. \n \n\nItem \nZhengding : Average SWM tariff

The FIRR and financial net present value (FNPV) were computed for all revenue-\ngenerating  components  at  November  2008  prices.  The  FIRR  is  compared  with  the  WACC  to \nascertain  financial  viability.  The  post-tax  WACC  in  real  terms  is  1.0%\u20131.2%.  Current  tariffs  are \nsufficient  to  recover  operating  and  capital  costs.  There  is  limited  risk  of  downward  revision  since \nproposed tariffs have already been approved through public hearings held by subproject counties. \nThe  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  implementation  delays  associated  with  corresponding  cost \nincreases.  \n \nWater  Supply.  The  current  domestic  water  tariff  in  Shengfang  Town  is  CNY1.80/m3  for \n7. \ndomestic  users,  with  industries  charged  CNY3.70/m3  and  other  users  charged  CNY2.80/m3.  The \nweighted  average  tariff  in  2008  is  CNY2.6/m3.  The  component  is  expected  to  reach  100%  cost \nrecovery in 2012 and is financially viable with an FIRR of 5.3% and FNPV of CNY41.7 million.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13          57   \n\nWastewater.  The current  wastewater  tariff  for domestic  users  in  Zhaoxian  is  CNY0.25/m3 \n8. \nand, for industries, CNY0.42/m3. The Zhaoxian wastewater treatment component has an average \ntariff of CNY0.4/m3 and 69% cost recovery at the start of operations in 2012. The FIRR is 8.7% and \nFNPV is CNY97.9 million, both below the WACC of 1.0%.  \n \nHeating.  The  current  heating  tariff  in  Zhaoxian  is  CNY9.88/m2  of  built  area  per  month  in \n9. \nwinter,  which  results  in  91%  cost  recovery  in  2012  and  is  expected  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery \nwith  higher  capacity  utilization.  The  FIRR  is  9.7%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  WACC  of \n1.0%, and the FNPV is CNY185.6 million, substantiating the financial viability of the Project.  \n \n10. \nSolid Waste Management. In Zhaoxian, the SWM tariff is CNY1.44/household/month. The \ntariffs collected at present are not sufficient to cover the cost of collection, transfer, treatment, and \ndisposal of waste. Additional revenues will come from recycling and processing compost fertilizer. \nThe Zhaoxian SWM component has, with 100,000 m3 capacity, an FIRR of 8.8% and a FNPV of \nCNY57  million  and  is  financially  viable  because  of  sales  of  compost  fertilizer.    In  Zhengding,  the \nSWM tariff is CNY1.1/household/month. Recycling and processing compost fertilizer will generate \nincome  that  will  cover  the  cost  of  operations  and  investment  requirements.  The  Zhengding \ncomprehensive SWM processing facility has an FIRR of 8.7%, which compares favorably with the \nWACC of 1.1% and a FNPV of CNY135.3 million.  \n \n\nTable A13.3: Financial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses \nCase 1: Costs \nPlus 10% \n\nCase 2: Revenues \nLess 10% \n\nBase Case \n\n \n\n \n\n  Case 3: Cases 1 and 2\n\nNPV  \n(CNY million)\n \n\nNPV \n (CNY million)\n \n\nFIRR  \nComponent \n(%) \nZhengding \n \n8.7 \nSolid Waste \nZhaoxian \n \n8.8 \nSolid waste \n8.7 \nWastewater \n9.7 \nHeating \nBazhou \n \nShengfang Water Supply \n5.3 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n \n7.8 \n \n7.9 \n7.7 \n8.6 \n \n4.4 \n\n135.3 \n \n57.0 \n97.9 \n185.6 \n \n41.7 \n\n126.4 \n \n53.2 \n91.3 \n163.4 \n \n35.2 \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n \n4.0 \n \n4.1 \n5.8 \n4.9 \n \n3.1 \n\nNPV  \n(CNY million) \n \n51.5 \n \n24.1 \n75.5 \n79.2 \n \n19.2 \n\nFIRR \n (%) \n \n2.9 \n \n3.5 \n5.0 \n3.7 \n \n2.4 \n\nNPV  \n(CNY million)\n \n31.1 \n \n20.3 \n68.6 \n53.6 \n \n12.8 \n\n \n11. \nFinancial  Projections, Entity  Level.

The  county  governments  receive  taxes,  nontax  income, \nshared  revenues  with  the  central  Government,  and  transfers  and  subsidies  from  the  central \nGovernment.  In  recent  years,  county  governments  have  become  more  reliant  on  the  central \nGovernment  as  the  internally  generated  share  of  their  total  revenues  has  decreased.  County \nexpenditures  increased  on  average  by  25%\u201330%  annually,  financed  by  internal  sources  and \ntransfers  from  the  central  Government  for  major  infrastructure  investments.  The  counterpart  fund \nrequirement  for  project  implementation  comprises  about  10%  of  income  in  the  subproject  cities, \nand  the  county  and  city  governments  have  earmarked  funds  for  each  subproject.  The  county \ngovernments  will  ultimately  be  responsible  for  debt  service.  Debt  service  and  O&M  amounted  to \nabout 2% of total expenditures in each subproject city or county.  \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nfor \n\nthe  Executing  Agency  and  all \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  for \n13. \nthe  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB5 using  the \nfinancial  management  assessment  questionnaire \nthe \nimplementing agencies (IAs) and operating companies. Financial statements need to be improved \nby  including  explanatory  notes,  and  in  the  case  of  companies  a  cash  flow  statement  should  be \nincluded. Budgets need to be used as a tool to regularly monitor progress and highlight variances \nto  management  so  that  timely  corrective  action  can  be  taken.  Auditing  needs  substantial \nimprovement in most organizations and external audit needs to be carried out by the Audit Bureau \non a regular basis. Further, the audit is in the form of compliance with local regulations rather than \nassessing  the  accounting  system,  which  is  essential  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  financial \nstatements produced. Internal audit needs to be undertaken to highlight any systemic weaknesses \nand  ensure  that  transactions  audit  will  be  undertaken  by  an  independent  auditor  firm.  It  was \nobserved  that  many  operating  companies  still  use  manual  accounting  systems.  Computerization \nshould  be  actively  pursued,  and  off-the-shelf  accounting  packages  should  be  installed  in  the \nagencies  concerned.  Since  many,  if  not  all,  of  the  IAs  and  operating  companies  have  not \nimplemented an ADB project, training in ADB financial management and disbursement procedures \nwill be provided to all finance staff. \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2001.

For  the  overall  Project,  including  subsequent  subprojects  yet  to  be  selected,  the \nanalysis covers the (i) economic rationale for public intervention, (ii) basis for selecting subprojects \nand components, and (iii) goals and design of the Project. The economic analysis also evaluates \nthe  components  through  least-cost  analysis  and  benefit\u2013cost  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was \nconducted  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects1 and Economic Analysis Retrospective 2005: Strengthening Quality-at-Entry of \nADB Operations.2  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\n2. \nRationale for Public Intervention. The development of Hebei Province is anchored on the \n11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  of  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which \nemphasizes  the  potential  of  small  cities  and  towns  to  provide  a  higher  standard  of  living  to  rural \nmigrants without exacerbating infrastructure fatigue and other problems afflicting large cities. Small \ncities  and  towns  in  Hebei  Province  face  challenges  similar  to  those  of  other  northern  PRC \nprovinces. In some towns, industrial development has outstripped infrastructure provision, causing \nenvironmental  degradation  and  suboptimal  conditions  for  business  development.  In  other  towns, \nthe challenge remains to attract substantial investment that will provide employment opportunities \nto current residents and future migrants. \n \n3. \nHebei\u2019s policy for developing its small cities and towns mirrors the national policy. Hebei\u2019s \nSocial and Economic Development 11th FYP calls for the development of a more balanced urban \nsystem  through  the  growth  of  medium-sized  cities  that  can  serve  as  economic  centers  for \nsurrounding  towns.  The  Hebei  Urbanization  11th  FYP  identifies  a  major  urban  development  axis \nlinking  Shijiazhuang  to  the  northeast  with  Tangshan.  Handan  and  Baoding  are  also  identified  as \ngrowth  poles.  The  growth  of  each  of  these  medium-sized  cities  is  designed  to  increase  their \neconomic weight and enable them to develop beneficial upstream economic linkages with smaller \ncities  and  towns  in  their  hinterlands.  County-level  cities  and  towns,  in  turn,  are  expected  to \nenhance  their  economic  relationship  with  rural  areas  that  depend  primarily  on  agriculture.  In  this \nrespect,  town  and  county-level  city  development  contributes  directly  to  the  provincial  objective  of \npromoting integrated development of rural and urban areas. To promote quality standards in urban \nservices, the Hebei Urban Construction 11th FYP emphasizes the need for more efficient delivery \nof urban services. Ranked 11th among 31 provinces in gross domestic product per capita, Hebei \nfaces  a  challenge  to  develop  small  cities  and  towns  in  a  way  that  combines  urban  growth \nmanagement with the promotion of economic development.  \n \n4. \nThe proposed ADB financing offers cities and towns in the poorer counties of Hebei to the \nnorth  and  west  of  Beijing  the  opportunity  to  develop  their  infrastructure  to  enable  investments  in \nnatural resource processing, manufacturing, and services. Other towns that have already achieved \nhigh economic growth rates, such as those located along the Shijiazhuang\u2013Tangshan development \naxis, can improve living conditions by investing in urban environmental infrastructure to be financed \nunder the proposed Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f60          Appendix 14           \n\n5. \nThe  Project  involves  government  intervention  at  several  levels.  The  Hebei  provincial \ngovernment  (HPG)  promotes  development  in  cities  and  towns  in  a  more  coordinated  and  cost-\neffective  manner  by  bringing  about  more  sustainable  investments  in  physical  and  environmental \nprotection infrastructure that aims to improve the quality of life. The involvement of HPG is justified \nsince  the  development  program  spans  several  small  cities  and  towns.  Municipal  governments \ncoordinate  and  implement  the  elements  of  the  master  plans  and  make  individual  investments  in \nwater supply, wastewater and solid waste management, and district heating works, and they will be \ninvolved  in  owning  and  managing  some  of  the  completed  facilities.  The  economic  rationale  is \nsound,  based  on  managing  such  natural  monopolies  as  water  supply,  wastewater  and  waste \nmanagement,  and  heating  exchange.  Limited  opportunities  to  generate  revenues  in  the  case  of \nsolid  waste  management  and  urban  environmental  improvement  make  it  difficult  for  the  private \nsector to invest in the proposed urban improvements. Also, existing tariffs provide a low base from \nwhich  to  adjust  tariffs  to  levels  that  could  cover  costs  and  make  them  attractive  to  the  private \nsector.  Negative  externalities  associated  with  the  unplanned  disposal  of  solid  waste  and \nwastewater provides additional justification for public sector investments. \n \nC. \n\nSelection of Subprojects and Core Components  \n\n6. \nThe  selection  of  the  three  core  subprojects  was  based  on  socioeconomic  indicators  and \ntheir  level  of  preparedness  to  undertake  investments  in  municipal  infrastructure.  The  core \nsubprojects  are  in  Bazhou  City,  Zhaoxian  County,  and  Zhengding  County.  These  areas  are \ncurrently  urbanized  below  the  Hebei  average,  which  is  30%.  Among  the  considerations  in  the \nselection  of  subprojects  is  the  availability  of  viable  investment  projects  that  directly  support \napproved development  master plans and programs and have the potential to serve as models in \nthe preparation of subsequent components during Project implementation. Targeting and selecting \nsubsequent key subproject cities and towns will be based on, among other factors, their potential to \ngrow economically and provide jobs to migrants from rural areas. Employment growth is deemed to \ncontribute  more  toward  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  closing  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap  than  does \nthe  growth  of  economic  production.  The  core  subprojects  focus  on  the  development  of  citywide \nprimary  and  secondary  infrastructure,  with  emphasis  on  environmental  infrastructure.  Five  of  the \nsix  components  identified  (water  supply,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and river improvement) involve urban environmental infrastructure. \n \n7. \nKey urbanization issues are (i) the inadequate availability of water supply, heat supply, and \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  treatment;  (ii)  severe  air,  river,  and  groundwater  pollution;  (iii)  a \nsignificant share  of  the urban  population  living under  the  poverty  line; and  (iv)  the  lack  of  holistic \nand  integrated  management  of  urban  development.  The  Project  aims  to  address  these  issues  in \nthe  participating  cities  to  help  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization; \nnarrow the rural-urban income gap; and improve production, employment, and living conditions. \n \nGoals and Design of the Project. The Project is a direct response to HPG\u2019s 11th FYP to \n8. \npromote  sustainable  economic  development,  particularly  in  its  small  cities  and  towns,  by \nconstructing  and  upgrading  infrastructure  while  protecting  the  environment.  The  11th  FYP \nrecognizes  that  achieving  these  goals  will  require  improved  basic  municipal  services  and \nenvironmental  quality  in  these  areas.  All  subproject  components  in  the  proposed  Project  are  an \nintegral  component  in  the  11th  FYP.  Small  city  and  town  governments  are  required  to  make \ninvestments  in  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  district  heating,  river  improvement,  and \nsolid waste management. The city and county government master plans are reasonably sound and \nintegrated with the overall planning process. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14          61   \n\nD. \n\nDemand Analysis  \n\nthe  river \n\nimprovement  component, \n\nDemand  forecasts  were  reviewed  for  the  water  supply,  wastewater,  solid  waste,  and \nleast-cost  analysis  was \n\n9. \nheating  subcomponents.  For \nundertaken. \n \n10. \nFor  the  Shengfang  water  supply  component,  water  demand  in  2015  was  estimated  at \n40,000 cubic meters per day (m3/d) and would service residents in the existing town and those in \nthe expansion area in the northeast of the town. The Project is designed for a capacity of 20,000 \nm3/d  to  supplement  the  existing  plant  capacity  of  20,000  m3/d,  bringing  total  capacity  to  40,000 \nm3/d. This component is estimated to serve a population of about 214,000, or 61,000 households.  \n \n11. \nFor  the  Zhaoxian  heating  component,  the  total  heating  area  is  projected  at  4,130,000 \nsquare  meters  (m2)  in  2010  and  9,060,000  m2  in  2020.  Zhaoxian  County  has  a  population  of \n117,2003 and  is  projected  to  increase  to  145,000  in  2010  and  190,000  in  2020.  The  Project  will \nincrease  centralized  heating  coverage  from  14%  to  80%  by  rehabilitating  and  expanding  the \nexisting  heating  system.  It  is  expected  that,  after  the  completion  of  the  project,  heating  supply \ncapacity will reach 387 MW, providing heating to 3.0 million m2 in 2010 and 7.3 million m2 in 2020. \n \n12. \nFor Zhaoxian solid waste management, total waste generation is projected to increase from \n195  tons  per  day  (t/d)  in  2010  to  258  t/d  in  2020.  The  subproject  is  expected  to  increase  waste \ncollection coverage to 100% in 2015 from 60% at present. The population of Zhaoxian County is \ngrowing quickly at 5% annually, and growth was assumed at 5% for 2006\u20132010 and 3% for 2011\u2013\n2020. Waste generated per capita was based on a study of garbage output of 500 small cities in \nthe PRC.  \n \n13. \nFor  the  Zhaoxian  wastewater  component,  the  total  volume  of  wastewater  generated  is \nestimated to be 100,000 m3/d in 2015, with industrial wastewater accounting for 12% of the total. \nThis is based on a projected population of 150,000, with 160 liters per capita per day consumption \nand  a  return  rate  of  80%  for  domestic  wastewater,  and  3.18  square  kilometers  of  industrial  land \nwith demand of 3.5 m3 per kilometer per day. The proposed plant would have a design capacity of \n50,000  m3/d  to  supplement  the  existing  plant  capacity  of  50,000  m3/d,  bringing  total  capacity  to \n100,000 m3/d.  \n \n14. \nFor the Zhengding solid waste component, the current population growth rate of Zhengding \nCounty  of  6%  was  assumed  to  continue  in  2006\u20132010  and  then  decrease  to  3%  in  2011\u20132020. \nThe estimated waste generated per capita was based on a study of garbage output of 500 small \ncities  in  the  PRC  starting  at  1.3  tons  per  capita  per  day.  Total  waste  generation  in  Zhengding  is \nprojected to increase from 378 t/d in 2010 to 512 t/d in 2020. The proposed solid waste treatment \nplant  capacity  is  600  t/d.  Households  are  projected  to  generate  500  tons,  while  industries  will \ngenerate 100 tons. The waste characterization study indicates that 54% of total weight is made up \nof organic wastes and another 10% is recyclable. Thus, it is projected that in 2010 about 242 t/d, \nand  in  2020  about  328  t/d,  of  household  waste  will  be  processed,  and  residual  waste  will  be \ndisposed  of  in  the  sanitary  landfill.  The  proposed  plant  will  have  an  annual  production  of  39,900 \ntons of compost fertilizer, 5,050 tons of recycled plastics, 860 tons of recycled glass, and 560 tons \nof recycled metals.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Heat Supply Project Plan for Urban Districts of Zhao County (2007\u20132020). \n\n \n\n\f62          Appendix 14           \n\nE. \n\nEvaluation of Individual Components \n\n15. \nThe methods of economic analysis adopted are benefit\u2013cost analysis (BCA) and least-cost \nanalysis (LCA). BCA was applied mainly to the revenue-generating components of the Project such \nas water supply, wastewater management, solid waste management, and heating, while LCA was \napplied  to  the  river  upgrading  component,  which  generates  no  revenues.  For  BCA,  estimates  of \neconomic benefits were based on regression outputs from the contingent valuation survey results \nconducted in selected pilot areas, and for similar components the regression results were applied \nusing  area-specific  socioeconomic  data  such  as  income,  education,  age,  and  gender.  The \ncontingent  valuation  survey  aimed  to  elicit  beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  services \nresulting  from  the  Project.  The  survey  was  conducted  in  Zhaoxian  County  covering  both \nwastewater and solid waste components. \n  \nThe  economic  analysis  of  each  component  was  conducted  over  25  years  including  the \n16. \nconstruction period. Economic benefits and costs are denominated in local currency and expressed \nin  November  2008  prices.  In  estimating  the  economic  investment  cost,  the  tradable  components \nwere  adjusted  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.08,  and  non-tradable  components  were \nvalued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage rate of 0.50 was applied on unskilled labor to \nreflect underemployment.4  \n \n17.  Major economic benefits that were quantified for each component include (i) resource cost \nsavings;  (ii)  environmental  benefits  for  district  heating;  and  (iii)  willingness  to  pay  for  the \nwastewater,  water  supply,  and  solid  waste  components.  The  economic  costs  include  (i) capital \ncost,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \ncosts  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operation  and  maintenance.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs \nwere estimated based on their opportunity costs\u2014that is, the agricultural output foregone and the \nre-siting of displaced activities when necessary.5 Physical contingencies and initial working capital \nwere included. Transfer payments such as taxes and import duties were excluded in estimating the \neconomic costs.  \n \n18. \nFor  the  BCA,  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  was  applied  with  the  feasibility  indicators \nexpressed  in  the  following  measures  of  viability:  net  present  value  (NPV)  and  economic  internal \nrate of return (EIRR) assuming a discount rate of 12%. The EIRRs were estimated by comparing \nscenarios  with  and  without  the  component.  A  core  subproject  component  is  considered \neconomically viable if the calculated EIRR is higher than 12%, the social discount rate prescribed \nby ADB. The EIRR for each component was tested for responsiveness to changes in the values of \nkey  project  variables  using  sensitivity  analysis  calculating  the  sensitivity  indicator  and  switching \nvalue. \n \nF. \n\nSummary of Results of the Economic Analysis  \n\n19. \nThe  economic  analysis  shows  that  the  components  subjected  to  BCA  are  economically \nviable  and  stand  up  to  sensitivity  tests.  The  EIRRs  and  NPVs  of  the  core  subprojects,  shown  in \nTables  A14.1  and  A14.2,  are  31%  for  the  Shengfang  component,  22%  for  the  Zhaoxian \ncomponent, and 21% for the Zhengding component. \n \n20. \nThe Shengfang and Zhengding subprojects\u2019 EIRRs are higher than 12%, indicating that the \nsubprojects are economically justified. Sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR for the Shengfang \n                                                 \n4  These assumptions are based on the Guidelines for the Preparation of Feasibility Study of Investment Projects issued \n\nby National Development and Reform Commission in 2002. \n\n5  The economic opportunity cost of land will be assumed to be equal to the replacement value of farmland calculated for \n\nland compensation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14          63   \n\nwater  supply  component  is  most  sensitive  to  a  change  in  willingness  to  pay,  as  estimated  in  the \ncontingent  valuation  survey.  The  Zhengding  subproject  is  most  sensitive  to  both  an  decrease  in \nbenefits and an increase in costs. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Results of Shengfang and Zhengding Subprojects  \nShengfang Water Supply \n\n \n\nZhengding Solid Waste \n\n \nSV \n(%) \n\n \nSI \n(%) \n \n0.8 \n1.8 \n1.0 \n0.6 \n\n96.7 \n89.2 \n79.6 \n72.1 \n89.8 \n\nNPV \n(CNY million) \n\nNPV  \n(CNY million) \n\n \n130.1 \n56.5 \n100.0 \n165.2 \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n30.9 \n28.3 \n28.1 \n25.7 \n28.6 \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n20.8 \n15.2 \n14.6 \n13.2 \n17.6 \n\nSI \nItem \n(%) \n \nBase case \n6.2 \nCase 1: 10% increase in costs  \n7.2 \nCase 2: 10% decrease in benefits  \n8.7 \nCase 3: Case 1 and 2 \nCase 4: 1 year delay in implementation \n2.2 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21. \nThe  Zhaoxian  components'  EIRRs  are  higher  than  12%,  indicating  that  the  Zhaoxian \nsubproject is economically justified. Table A14.2 shows the results of the base case and sensitivity \ntests. The Zhaoxian components are more sensitive to a decline in benefits than to an increase in \ncosts;  the  wastewater  and  solid  waste  components  are  most  sensitive  to  reduced  willingness  to \npay, based on the contingent valuation survey. Under a scenario of a 50% decrease in willingness \nto pay, the sensitivity indicator for NPV for wastewater is approximately 2% and the switching value \nis  38%.  For  the  solid  waste  management  component,  on  the  other  hand,  a  50%  decrease  in \nwillingness to pay will render the component economically unviable.  \n\nSV \n(%) \n \n16.1 \n13.9 \n11.5 \n45.5 \n\n38.9 \n14.8 \n10.9 \n5.2 \n27.8 \n\n \nTable A14.2: Results of Zhaoxian Subprojects \n\nDistrict Heating \n\n \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n  Wastewater Treatment Plant \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\n20.2 \n\nNPV \n(CNY \nmillion) \n38.9 \n\nSI \n\nSV \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nSI \n\nSV \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n19.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n26.9 \n\nNPV \n(CNY \nmillion) \n23.4 \n\nNPV \n(CNY \nmillion) \n57.4 \n\nSI \n\nSV \n\n \n\n \n\n18.4 \n\n32.6 \n\n1.6 \n\n61.1 \n\n18.0 \n\n19.5 \n\n1.7 \n\n60.3 \n\n23.6 \n\n47.8 \n\n1.7 \n\n59.9 \n\n15.0 \n\n12.5 \n\n6.8 \n\n14.7 \n\n13.9 \n\n5.3 \n\n7.7 \n\n12.9 \n\n23.3 \n\n42.0 \n\n2.7 \n\n37.5 \n\n13.4 \n\n6.2 \n\n8.4 \n\n11.9 \n\n12.5 \n\n1.4 \n\n9.4 \n\n10.6 \n\n20.2 \n\n32.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n17.1 \n\n26.8 \n\n2.4 \n\n42.0 \n\n16.9 \n\n16.2 \n\n2.4 \n\n42.3 \n\n22.6 \n\n45.8 \n\n1.7 \n\n57.7 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nNote: Contingent valuation survey (to measure willingness-to-pay) was not conducted for district heating component. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22. \nThe  results  of  the  economic  analysis  demonstrate  the  economic  viability  of  the  three \ncomponents  and  their  respective  subcomponents.
