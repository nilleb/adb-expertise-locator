THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) for the additional financing of the Lae Port Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The overall project will expand the cargo handling capacity of PNG\u2019s largest sea port at Lae, \nthe capital of Morobe province. The overall project will also help improve the livelihood of project-\naffected people and reduce the prevalence of HIV in Lae and surrounding localities. This involves \nfinancing (i) construction of port facilities including a tidal basin, a multipurpose berth, and terminal \nworks; (ii) resettlement and livelihood improvement and social improvement for affected people; (iii) \nconsulting  services  for  project  management,  construction  supervision,  financial  management, \nresettlement,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring;  and  (iv)  gender-responsive  programs  for  HIV \nawareness  and  prevention.  Current  project  implementation  preconstruction  activities  are mostly \ncomplete, including the relocation of 3,200 people from the project site.2 \n \n3.  As a result of input price increases, the devaluation of the US dollar against the kina, and \ndesign modifications, the total current project cost has increased from $154.0 million at appraisal in \n2007 to $291.4 million in 2011. The current project rationale is valid and remains applicable. The \ncurrent project scope has been revised to include some improvements to construction solutions. \nAdditional financing is requested for 65% of the total overall project cost increase, the balance to be \nprovided from government resources. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Development Need \n4.  Lae port is PNG\u2019s largest, busiest, and most important port. It is a gateway linking world \nmarkets with PNG and a large hinterland containing 40% of PNG\u2019s population and half of PNG\u2019s \neconomic capacity, including hydrocarbon and mineral resources. Lae port\u2019s cargo throughput has \nincreased by 7.8% annually since 2006. In 2011, the cargo through Lae port is estimated to reach \n3.3 million revenue tons, stretching the port to the limit of its capacity. PNG Ports Corporation \nLimited (PPCL) is increasing the operational efficiency of Lae port, which will help cope with the \nexisting cargo traffic. However, the need for additional berth space is now critical. A larger and more \nefficient Lae port will ease a nationally significant infrastructure bottleneck that is impeding economic \ngrowth. The overall project is a high priority of the Government of PNG.3 \n \n2.  The Current Project \n5.  The overall project will expand the capacity of Lae port by building a tidal basin (700 x 400 \nmeters [m]) northwest of the present port facilities with a dredged depth of 13 m below sea level, a \nmultipurpose berth (240 m long and 45\u201350 m wide), and terminal works including all buildings, \nstorage areas, roads, drainage, water, electricity, and sewerage services. The tidal basin and berth \nare designed to accommodate vessels with an overall length of 200 m, beam of 32.2 m, and fully \nladen draft of 12 m. The procurement of these works is at an advanced stage. \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2007.

Manila (Loan nos. 2398-PNG and 2399-PNG) (accessible from the list of linked supplementary \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Update of the Port Sector Analysis (accessible from the list of linked supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n \n6.   The overall project involves the relocation and livelihood and social improvement of about \n3,200 people living on the project site. The government has financed and completed the relocation, \nand  a  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction4 grant  is  now  financing  the  livelihood  and  social \nimprovement program (footnote 1). To minimize the potential risk of new HIV infections, the overall \nproject includes support for an effective and sustainable response to the HIV epidemic in and around \nLae port and Morobe province. The Lae Chamber of Commerce is the implementing agency and \nactivities include (i) developing an HIV and AIDS code of conduct for businesses; (ii) improving \nseafarers\u2019  facilities;  (iii)  strengthening  clinical  institutional  structures;  (iv)  strengthening \nnongovernment organizations, AIDS site committees, and the Lae police; and (v) caring for people \nwith HIV.5 \n \n3.  Additional Financing Required and Eligibility \n7.  Additional financing: The required additional financing results from cost overruns (input \nprice increases and US dollar depreciation) and from design modifications to the current project. The \ntotal cost of the overall project has increased by $137.4 million, from $154.0 million in 2007 to \n$291.4 million in 2010 (89%). The increase comprises $124.44 million relating to civil and other \nworks, $9.33 million for contingencies, and $3.63 million for financial charges. The cost of civil and \nrelated works has increased from $109.4 million in 2007 to $233.7 million in 2010. The 2010 costs \nhave been confirmed by the four conforming tender bids received and evaluated by the project \nexecuting  agency,  the  Independent  Public  Business  Corporation  (IPBC).  The  cost  increases \nexcluding contingencies and financial charges result from several factors, as summarized in Table \n1.6 \nTable 1: Cost Increase Factors \n($ million) \nFactors  Amount  Percent \nInput price increasesa  62.46  50.00 \nUS dollar depreciationb  38.17  31.00 \nDesign modifications  23.81  19.00 \n  Total  124.44  100.00 \na  Design items included in the 2007 RRP. \nb  Depreciation of US dollar against kina: $1 = K2.797 in the 2007 report and recommendation of the President \ncompared with $1 = K2.299 as of 30 June 2011. \nSources: Government of Papua New Guinea and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  Input price increases. Since project appraisal in 2007, historically unprecedented economic \ndevelopments in PNG as well as extreme economic fluctuations globally have combined to inflate \nthe US dollar costs of port facility construction. Cost inflation during the 3 years of preconstruction \nproject implementation raised the cost of the current project as designed in 2007 by $62.46 million. \nPrice  increases  relate to  inputs  such  as  structural  steel  and  concrete  and  non-imported  items \nincluding labor, materials, and energy (footnote 6). The current project implementation delay was \ndue to relocation negotiations with people living on the project site (para. 17). The time needed to \nreach agreement and execute the relocation plan coincided with a period of unusual growth and cost \nescalation in PNG. \n \n9.  The buoyant PNG economy, which grew at an average rate of 7% from 2007 to 2010 is \nfacing  severe supply-side  constraints that  are  inflating  prices  across  the  economy.  Cumulative \ninflation in PNG between the end of 2007 and the end of 2010 is officially estimated to be around \n25% but it is widely recognized that official consumer price index data significantly underestimate \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2007.

", "3 \n \nactual inflation.7 Inflationary pressures have been particularly acute in the construction sector, with \nofficial figures showing that construction prices grew by 35% between the end of 2007 and the end \nof 2010.8 \n  \n10.  Capacity constraints in the construction sector result largely from the ongoing construction of \na $15 billion liquefied natural gas project and its spillover effects across the economy. The sector \nhas shown limited capacity to expand in response to the massive increases in demand resulting \nfrom port congestion, regulatory impediments, and perceptions that PNG offers a high-risk operating \nenvironment because of the country\u2019s poor law and order situation. Employers report shortages of \nskilled  labor,  and  port  and  construction  companies  are  operating  at  close  to  full  capacity.  In \nparticular, strong demand for the limited supply of contractors in PNG is leading to rising contractor \nrates for engineering, construction, and transport services. These effects are particularly strong in \nthe Lae area through which most supplies of construction material, equipment, and processing pass \nto the gas extraction plant and pipeline. The official consumer price index in the Lae urban area \ngrew by 33% between the end of 2007 and the end of 2010, well above the national average.9 \n \n11.  US dollar depreciation. In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, the US dollar has \ndepreciated against other currencies. It devalued 17.8% against the kina between the beginning of \n2007 and the end of 2010.10 This depreciation has increased the overall project cost by $38.17 \nmillion.  \n12.  Design modifications. Modifications to the current project design relate to (i) site clearance \nand site investigations, (ii) wharf structures, (iii) slope protection, and (iv) the diversion of Mai Creek. \nAppraisal cost estimates were based on preliminary engineering designs. IPBC was diligent and \nprudent  in  requiring  additional  geotechnical  surveys  to  guide  detailed  engineering  and  design. \nDesign changes respond to this additional information and exploit other opportunities to improve the \ntechnical quality of construction solutions.11  \n \n13.  Eligibility  for  additional  financing.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  may  provide \nadditional  financing  to  projects  that  (i)  remain  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially sound; (ii) are accorded high priority by the government; (iii) are consistent with the \ncurrent project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) are consistent with the current country partnership \nstrategy.12 These  eligibility  criteria  are  met  for  the  proposed  additional  financing.  The  current \nproject\u2019s technical feasibility has been strengthened and higher-than-original economic and financial \nreturns are expected. The government has confirmed that the overall project is a nationally important \nstrategic investment and the current project\u2019s development objectives are unchanged. The PNG \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 confirms sea transport infrastructure as a strategic priority \nfor ADB.13 \n \n14.  The Lae Port Development Project meets the eligibility conditions for additional financing for \ncost overruns because of (i) specific input price increases or overall inflation, (ii) exchange rate \n                                                \n7  International Monetary Fund. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n \nfluctuations, (iii) underestimated costs, and (iv) delays. The current project also meets the eligibility \nconditions for additional financing resulting from project modifications: (i) the changes are needed to \naccommodate  changed  (engineering  design)  implementation  conditions  and  to  respond  to \ninnovations;  and  (ii)  the  changes  are  consistent  with  government  priorities,  the  development \nobjectives of the current project, and the country partnership strategy. \n \n15.  The current project has addressed all design and most implementation problems, and it has \nbeen performing well for most of the past 12 months. The cost overruns result primarily from a 2-\nyear implementation delay caused by the need for complex relocation negotiations with people living \non the current project site.14 IPBC, the Morobe Provincial Government, and ADB worked closely to \nachieve a successful outcome, but the time needed to agree and execute the relocation plan was \nunderestimated at appraisal. \n \n16.  Although the current project has been delayed, it meets four out of six of the standards for \nadditional financing for a project not performing well: (i) the overall project will likely deliver its \nexpected outputs; (ii) implementation progress has been satisfactory in the last 12 months, though \ncontract  awards  and  disbursements  were  delayed;  (iii)  compliance  with  safeguard  policy \nrequirements is satisfactory; and (iv) risks have been managed successfully. With the successful \nrelocation of affected people off the project site, no further significant implementation problems are \nforeseen. The current project is rated actual problem in the project performance report, but this is \nonly due to contract awards and disbursements being significantly behind schedule because of the \nimplementation delay caused by the relocation negotiations. The rating results from the delayed \naward of the port facilities civil works contract, which is the single principal contract for the overall \nproject. The contract was successfully tendered in May 2011 and is expected to be awarded either \nin late 2011 or early 2012, at which point the current project is expected to be rated on track. \n \n4.  Implementation Progress \n17.  Progress. Preconstruction activities are mostly complete, including detailed engineering and \ndesign  and  the  revision  of  engineers\u2019  cost  estimates.  The  construction  supervision  consultant \ncontract has been awarded, the civil works contract has been successfully tendered, and ADB has \nissued no objection for the contract award. The project site is cleared and contractors can be \nmobilized immediately after the contract is signed. Affected people are receiving livelihood and \nsocial improvement support, and many businesses and communities in Lae are participating in the \ngender-responsive HIV awareness and prevention program (footnote 5). \n \n18.  Lessons learned. The lesson learned is that project implementation schedules for complex \nprojects need to be conservative. Additionally, price contingencies in a natural resource-driven high-\ngrowth situation should be generous. Ideally for port facilities projects, all necessary geotechnical \nsurveys and detailed engineering and design should be completed during project preparation. \n \n19.  Policy dialogue. The current project is underpinned by strong policy dialogue between ADB \nand  the  government.  The  dialogue  has  continued  during  implementation  and  focuses  on  (i) \nresettlement  plan  arrangements  and  ongoing  monitoring;  (ii)  IPBC  responsibilities  and  project \nmanagement arrangements and capacity building; (iii) PPCL tariff and revenue generation, including \nannual  tariff  reviews  through  the  regulator,  the  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition \nCommission; and (iv) public\u2013private partnership (PPP) opportunities for future port development and \noperation.15 ADB completed a preliminary assessment of Lae port PPP potential, which is being \nused by IPBC to prepare a time-bound PPP strategy and action plan. \n                                                \n14 Summary of Project Performance and Revised Project Cost Estimates (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n15 ADB helped the government prepare a national PPP policy, which was approved by the cabinet in December 2009. The \nnext phase of ADB support has helped produce a PPP bill and regulations, which are likely to be tabled in Parliament in \nNovember 2011 or early 2012. ", "5 \n \n \n5.  Safeguard Compliance \n20.  Activities  under  the  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  original  loan  have  been  mostly \ncompleted  and  the  livelihood  support  programs  and  resettlement  monitoring  are  in  progress. \nRelocation from the project site of a canoe landing site and fish market for a local clan, the Labu, will \nbe completed before the start of port facility civil works. \n \n21.  The current project was categorized environmental category A  and a full environmental \nimpact assessment of the current project was carried out under the project preparatory technical \nassistance.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  and  environmental  management  plan  were \nposted on the ADB website in compliance with the disclosure requirements of ADB\u2019s Environmental \nPolicy (2002). \n \n6.  Management of Risks \n22.  Resettlement was considered the greatest risk to the current project and IPBC has managed \nthis risk effectively. To date, contract packages and procurement methods have been properly \ndefined and closely followed to ensure that capable, reputable, and reliable suppliers, contractors, \nand nongovernment organizations are hired. \n \n23.  The other identified major risk was corruption. Recruitment of consultants and contractors \nhas  closely  followed  ADB  recruitment  and  procurement  procedures.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of \ncorruption: (i) the project management unit (PMU) management and all staff have been trained in \nADB\u2019s and the government\u2019s anticorruption policies, the concept of whistle-blowing, and methods of \nreducing vulnerability to corruption; (ii) IPBC will develop and maintain a project website to disclose \nthe audited project financial accounts, overall project progress, and procurement activities; (iii) direct \npayment procedures will predominate; (iv) imprest accounts will be prudently used and closely \nmonitored by ADB; (v) ADB has participated in the selection of key consultants in consultation with \nIPBC, and reviewed beforehand the bidding documents and contract awards for all international and \nnational competitive bidding contracts; and (vi) financial management is centralized in the PMU for \ninternal control. Identifying IPBC as the executing agency further mitigates the risk of corruption, as \nTransparency International is represented on the IPBC board of directors, and IPBC is among the \norganizations that are PNG\u2019s most closely watched. Other overall project risks pertain to law and \norder, project management, construction quality, and HIV prevalence. The overall project design \ntakes these potential risks into account. The government will be required to provide security during \noverall project implementation and IPBC continues to maintain a team of qualified counterpart staff \nin the PMU. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n24.  The impact and outcome of the overall project remain unchanged. The overall project will \ncatalyze industrial and commercial development and promote trade for PNG by relieving a binding \nconstraint on key port infrastructure in Lae. \n \nC.  Outputs \n25.  The outputs of the current project remain unchanged, and have been partly achieved. Details \nare in paras. 2, 5, and 6 (footnote 5). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plan \n26.  Investments.

The loan will have a 24-year term including a \ngrace period of 4 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were \nits own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n29.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,650,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the overall project. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 2.02% per annum during the grace ", "7 \n \nperiod and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. \n \n30.  The government will onlend the proceeds of the additional financing loans to IPBC through a \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  subsidiary  loan \nagreement shall be executed on the same financial and other terms and conditions as set out in the \nadditional finance loan agreements. The government will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate \nvariation risk of the additional finance loans. \n \n31.  The government is requesting ADB to finance the increased overall project cost for the \nfollowing reasons: (i) the resettlement program has been successfully completed and the project site \nis available for civil works to commence immediately; (ii) switching funding sources of the overall \nproject  would disrupt the awarding of the port facilities civil works contract package and may result \nin significant delay in completion of the overall project; (iii) the overall project is urgent and critical for \nthe economic development of the entire Highlands region and Morobe province as a result of \nongoing congestion problems at the port, and the impending commencement of the liquefied natural \ngas project and other extractive industries projects; (iv) the government does not have readily \navailable similarly priced funding that can accommodate the identified cost increase; and (v) tidal \nbasin  and  facilities  construction  financing  under  a  PPP  arrangement  is  not  viable  because  of \nperceived construction risks.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n32.  There are no changes to the implementation arrangements for the original loan, which are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).16 The \nPAM for existing loans (footnote 1) was confirmed by the government.  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2008\u2013June 2014 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2014 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Steering Committee; IPBC managing director (chair); IPBC director, Planning and \nInfrastructure  Division  (secretary);  Senior  representatives  from  departments  of  National \nPlanning  and  Monitoring,  Treasury,  Justice  and  Attorney  General,  Lands  and  Physical \nPlanning,  Environment  and  Conservation,  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition \nCommission, Morobe Provincial Administration, and PNG Ports Corporation Limited (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Independent Public Business Corporation \n(iii) Key implementing  Morobe Provincial Administration (JFPR-funded component) and Lae Chamber of Commerce \nagencies  Incorporated (for the HIV and AIDS and gender components) \n(iv) Implementation unit  Lae, 10 staff \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  1 contract  $231.37 million \nConsulting services  Construction supervision  1 contract  $5.50 million \nDisbursement  All disbursements under the loans, ADB OCR-loan, ADB ADF-loan, OFID, and JFPR grant \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time); a copy was provided to IPBC.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n33.  Port facilities to be constructed by the overall project are described in para. 5. The tidal basin \nand wharf will be able to berth \u201cpanamax\u201d container vessels of a maximum 50,000 deadweight tons. \nA container yard of 12.7 hectares will be provided behind the wharf structure. Additional design \nelements  include  (i)  an  administration  building,  (ii)  cargo  shed,  (iii)  navigation  aid  towers,  (iv) \nservices infrastructure and security fencing, (v) Mai Creek diversion channel, and (vi) port link road \npavement.  The  design  life  conforms  with  IPBC  requirements,  current  good  practice,  and \ninternational codes. The marine structures will be designed to remain fully operational within the \ndesign life period. Technical aspects of the design remain largely unchanged since appraisal for the \noriginal loans and the overall project remains technically feasible. \n \nB.  Economic, Financial, and Public\u2013Private Partnership Opportunities \n34.  Economic evaluation. The 2007 forecasts for port traffic to 2030 for overseas and domestic \ncoastal cargo for Lae port were updated taking into account data on the actual traffic handled in \n2006\u20132011, which increased at an average annual rate of 7.8%, almost twice the rate assumed in \n2007. The revised cargo traffic forecasts used in the economic analysis for the additional financing \napplied the actual rate up to 2011, and after 2011 assumed an average annual cargo growth rate of \n6% (compared with 4% reducing to 3% assumed in the 2007 forecasts). The modest increase in the \nrevised  forecast  cargo  traffic  reflects  the  continuing  strong  economic  growth  in  the  Lae  port \nhinterland  and  the  multiplier  impacts  of  increased  consumption  expenditure  generated  by  new \ndevelopment projects.17 \n \n35.  The 2007 economic analysis was updated using the same methodology and assumptions, \nrevising the costs and benefits in line with the latest data, and actual experience since 2007. Capital \ncosts were updated to reflect actual expenditure to date and the revised design costs for the tidal \nbasin, while economic benefits were adjusted to reflect the increased cargo forecasted. \n \n36.  At a 12% discount rate, the overall project is economically viable. The net present value is \nabout K248 million (compared with K104 million in the 2007 report and recommendation of the \nPresident [RRP]) and the economic internal rate of return is 18.7% (compared with 15.8% in the \n2007 RRP). The economic internal rate of return calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to \ntest the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of \nthe overall project. The sensitivity analysis showed the overall project to be economically viable \ndespite a 20% increase in costs, a 20% decrease in benefits, or a 1-year delay in the construction \nperiod.  \n \n37.  Financial evaluation. Tariffs for essential services continue to be regulated by a contract \nbetween PPCL and the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission, and measured in \nterms of revenue earned per revenue ton of cargo have increased at an average annual rate of 14% \nbetween 2006 and 2011 (K24.09 per revenue ton in 2011 compared with K12.55 in the 2007 RRP). \n \n38.  The 2007 financial evaluation was updated using the same methodology and assumptions, \nrevising costs and revenues in line with actual experience since 2007. Capital costs were updated to \nreflect the revised design costs for the tidal basin, while revenue estimates were adjusted to reflect \nthe increased cargo forecasts and increased tariff rates. The financial analysis assumes that PPCL \nwill operate the new port facilities built under the overall project. \n \n                                                \n17 Updated Traffic Forecast and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n \n39.  Assuming existing revenue items remain the only revenue sources, real growth in revenue \nper cargo revenue ton continues in line with that experienced in 2006\u20132011 (5% annual real growth), \nand removing 50% of the excavation and/or dredging and reclamation costs for phase 2, the after-\ntax financial internal rate of return is 7.8% (compared with 6.8% in the 2007 RRP), which compares \nfavorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 5.1% in the 2007 RRP. The results of the \nsensitivity analyses (10% reduction in demand, 1-year delay in construction, 10% increase in project \ncosts, and 10% reduction in tariffs) confirm the robustness of the overall project\u2019s financial viability, \nalthough a 1-year delay in benefits lowers the financial internal rate of return to 3.3%.18 \n \n40.  Public\u2013private  partnership  opportunities.  In  2011,  ADB  studied  and  assessed \nopportunities for private involvement in the financing and operation of the tidal basin and facilities.19 \nThe overall project was assessed not to be financially viable for whole or partial private financing \nthrough a PPP model at this stage because of perceived high project construction risks. It was \nassessed that PPP potential will increase as the tidal basin phase 1 construction nears completion. \nPhase 2 construction risks will be lower and PPP/private financing may be financially viable. PPCL is \ncurrently undertaking a 20-year Lae Port Masterplan study to identify key infrastructure and service \nrequirements to support future growth. The Masterplan will be used to identify and develop PPP \nopportunities. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n41.  Since its incorporation in 2006, PPCL has improved corporate governance and financial \nmanagement,  particularly  in  budgeting  and  financial  reporting.  The  project  management \narrangements  established  by  IPBC,  including  the  PMU  and  project  steering  committee,  are \nconsidered to be operating effectively and no change to those arrangements is needed as a result of \nthe additional finance. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social Safeguards \n42.  The additional financing does not include additional works involving issues of involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, and gender; and has been classified category C for involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, and some gender benefits. All civil works will be undertaken in \nexisting  locations  identified  or  acquired  under  the  current  project.  Additional  safeguard \ndocumentation  on  involuntary  resettlement  is  not  required.  The  resettlement  implementation, \nmonitoring, grievance redress, and livelihood support programs will be continued during overall \nproject implementation according to the resettlement plan prepared under the current project. \n \nE.  Environmental Safeguards \n43.  The proposed additional finance loan is classified category B. The additional financing will \ninclude provision of additional quarry materials to build slope protection, a small creek diversion, and \nan access road. Environmental impacts caused by the additional financing would be short-term, \nlocalized,  and  can  be  mitigated.  An  updated  draft  initial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental management plan is being finalized by IPBC and will be posted on the ADB website \nin compliance with disclosure requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n44.  The  current  project  risks  will  continue  to  be  managed  through  mechanisms  already \nestablished  within  IPBC  to  ensure  ADB  recruitment  and  procurement  procedures  are  closely \nfollowed,  particularly  in  relation  to  disbursement  and  audited  project  financial  accounts.  Any \n                                                \n18 Updated Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 2011. Assessment on Facilitating Public-Private Partnership for the Lae Port Development Project. Manila. \n ", "10 \n \nremaining  resettlement  risk  is  minor  and  will  continue  to  be  monitored  by  IPBC.  Other  risks \npertaining  to  law  and  order,  project  management,  construction  quality,  and  HIV  and  AIDS \nprevalence will continue to be managed by IPBC through mechanisms already established. The \ngovernment  will  provide  security  during  overall  project  implementation  and  IPBC  continues  to \nmaintain a team of qualified counterpart staff in the PMU. Provided the port facilities civil works \ncontract is awarded within the bid validity period, there is minimal risk of further significant cost \noverruns  although  future  contract  variations  resulting  from  unforeseen  engineering  and  other \nimplementation issues cannot be ruled out. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n45.  The government and IPBC have assured ADB that implementation of the overall project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe PAM and the loan documents. All major loan covenants under the original loans have been \ncomplied with, except the requirement for the preparation of the time-bound action plan for PPP for \noperation of new port facilities constructed under the overall project. This will be done within 1 year \nfrom completion of the overall project.20 \n \n46.  The government and IPBC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the  overall \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. Disbursement under the \nloan shall not be made until the government and IPBC have concluded a subsidiary loan agreement, \nthe  terms  of  which  shall  have  the  same  financial  and  other  terms  as  required  in  the  loan \nagreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $85,000,000 to Papua New Guinea for the additional financing of the Lae \nPort Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending facility; for a term of 24 years, including a grace of period of 4 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,650,000 to Papua New Guinea for \nthe Lae Port Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  2.02%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \nthereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n10 November 2011 \n                                                \n20 PPCL is currently undertaking a 20-year Lae Port Masterplan exercise and targeting to complete it by December 2011. \nThe Masterplan will be used to identify and develop PPP opportunities and prepare the time bound action plan for \noperation of new port facilities constructed under the overall project.
