Under  the  project,  about \n100  local  authorities  selected  in  seven  provinces  (excluding  the  Northern  and  Eastern \nprovinces), whose reform plans are reviewed and confirmed by the government, will implement \nsubprojects  for  roads  and  bridges,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and other basic facilities, including building or enhancing health-care centers and \npublic markets. The project will support the institutional strengthening of the local authorities for \nimproved  and  sustainable  service  delivery  through  business  process  reengineering  and  the \ndevelopment of their information technology (IT) systems.2  \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  government\u2019s  development  policy  framework  highlights  the  need  for  balanced \nregional  development  to  ensure  that  every  household  in  Sri  Lanka  benefits  equally  from \neconomic  development. 3  It  stresses  the  need  to  channel  more  resources  to  the  poorer \nsegments of the population to rectify rural\u2013urban imbalances and improve access to social and \neconomic infrastructure including transport, drinking water supply, and public health care. While \nthe  urban  population  is  growing  at  3.0%  per  annum  and  is  expected  to  encompass  half  the \ncountry\u2019s total population by 2016, there is a large infrastructure deficit in peri-urban and small \ntownships  in  rural  areas.  Current  local  service  deficiencies  include  (i)  intermittent  or  limited \nwater  supply  services  in  many  townships;  (ii)  dilapidated  local  roads  that  hamper  connectivity \nand economic and social activities; (iii) haphazard solid waste management that includes a lack \nof suitable landfill sites, causing nuisance and public health risks; (iv) limited primary health-care \nfacilities; (v) inadequate drainage, causing waterlogging in township areas; and (vi) inadequate \npublic  market  facilities  that  hinder  local  economic  activity.  While  poverty  affects  the  general \npopulation  in  lagging  regions,  the  economic  and  social  activities  of  women  are  severely \nconstrained  by  poor  infrastructure  and  services.  Poverty  is  concentrated  in  areas  where \nconnectivity to towns and markets is relatively low.4 Improving infrastructure and service delivery \nstandards  in  these  areas  is  constrained  by  the  limited  financial,  technical,  and  management \ncapacity  of  local  authorities  responsible  for  local  service  delivery  under  a  decentralized \nadministrative system. \n\n \n4. \nSri Lanka has three types of local authorities under nine provincial councils: (i) municipal \ncouncils constituted in cities and large towns, (ii) urban councils for less urbanized areas, and \n(iii)  pradeshiya  sabhas5 in  peri-urban  and  rural  areas.6 To  respond  to  the  needs  of  improving \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA,  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan \n\nFund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n\n3  Government  of  Sri  Lanka. 2010.

Washington, DC. \n\nin peri-urban and rural areas. \n\n\f2          \n\nbasic  infrastructure  and  services  in  local  authorities,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  the  Local  Government  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  (LGIIP)  in  2005. 7  In \nalignment  with  the  government's  devolved  structure,  local  authorities  are  implementing \nsubprojects  for  water  supply,  roads,  drainage  and  sewerage,  and  other  municipal  facilities, \nincluding  constructing  or  renovating  public  libraries,  health-care  centers,  and  office  buildings. \nThe LGIIP adopted a bottom\u2013up, demand-driven approach that follows the priorities set out by \nlocal authorities and is being implemented successfully. Most, if not all, outcome indicators will \nbe  achieved  by  project  completion,  along  with  improvement  in  the  financial  management \ncapacity  of  local  authorities.  Unlike  the  common  practice  of  grant-based  financing  for  basic \ninfrastructure  improvement,  partial  debt  financing  has  provided  local  authorities  with  stronger \nownership and incentives to improve revenue collection and financial management.8 \n \nOne  limitation  of  the  LGIIP  is  that  poor  and  financially  weak  pradeshiya  sabhas  are \n5. \nunable to benefit because of their financial constraints. These local authorities are often located \nin  remote  areas;  have  very  small  revenue  bases,  if  any;  and  collect  very  limited  revenues \nthrough  assessment  taxes,  rental  fees,  and  licenses.  To  objectively  identify  less-developed \nareas  where  economic  and  social  infrastructure  and  services  are  limited  and  the  capacity  of \npradeshiya  sabhas  is  weak,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Provincial  Councils \n(MLGPC)  established  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  pradeshiya  sabhas,  covering  (i) \ngeographic  location  and  demography,  (ii)  social  infrastructure  and  quality  of  life,  (iii)  physical \ninfrastructure  and  services,  (iv)  financial  strength  and  resources,  and  (v)  local  authority \nmanagement  capacity. 9  Based  on  the  evaluation  results,  the  MLGPC  selected  about  100 \npradeshiya  sabhas  with  high  scores  (i.e.,  poor  infrastructure  with  weak  capacity)  in  seven \nprovinces  (excluding \ninfrastructure \nimprovement support under the project.10 \n\nthe  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces)  eligible \n\nfor \n\n \n6. \nMany  development  partners  including  ADB  are  prioritizing  support  to the  Northern  and \nEastern provinces, where reconstruction and development needs are high after the end of the \narmed  conflict  in  mid-2009.11 This  includes  grant  financing  to  all  local  authorities  in  the  two \nprovinces  for  service  improvement.12 However,  poverty  is  found  not  only  in  the  Northern  and \nEastern  provinces  but  in  other  provinces  as  well.  Districts  in  Sabaragamuwa,  Uva,  North \nWestern, Southern, and Central provinces recorded a poverty headcount index higher than 10% \nin 2009/2010, while the national average dropped from 15.2% in 2006/2007 to 8.9%.13 Despite a \ndecline  in  the  poverty  index  nationwide,  the  Gini-coefficient,  an  indicator  of  inequality,  has \nremained constant at 0.47 since 2002.14 There is a need to provide resources to less-developed \nareas of the country to help achieve balanced regional development. \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n6  There are 22 municipal councils, 42 urban councils, and 271 pradeshiya sabhas in the country in 2011. \n7  ADB.  2005.

Offices are hardly computerized and not operated \nin  an  efficient  and  citizen-friendly  manner.  Taxation,  licensing,  and  approval  systems  and \nprocesses  in  local  governments  leave  room  for  streamlining  to  attract  more  business.  The \ngovernment  is  currently  reforming  the  local  government  system  through  amendments  to  acts \nand ordinances governing local government, with the aim of reengineering business processes, \nenhancing  citizen  participation,  expanding  local  authorities\u2019  functions,  and  enhancing  revenue \nbases.15 Local infrastructure improvement will be most effective if it is implemented  along with \nreform in local government that strengthens its capacity. \n\n \n8. \nThe  project  will  follow  a  sector  lending  modality.  Building  on  the  government \ndevelopment policy framework and the National Policy on Local Government adopted in 2009, \nthe Local Government Development Plan, which is a medium-term sector development plan of \nthe MLGPC, has been formulated.16 The plan has two pillars: (i) advancing the reform of local \ngovernment  systems,  as  stated  above,  and  (ii)  improving  infrastructure  and  services, \nparticularly  in  areas  with  deficient  services.  The  MLGPC  has  the  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement  the  plan  with  support  provided  through  the  project  and  TA.  The  project  will  play  a \nkey role in assisting the government in implementing both pillars of the plan and is expected to \nachieve  great  impact  toward  strengthening  the  financial  and  management  capacity  of  local \nauthorities. \n\n \nLessons  from  previous  projects  and  evaluation  in  Sri  Lanka  include  the  need  to  (i) \n9. \nconfirm  the  commitment  of  local  governments  prior  to  their  participation  in  the  project, (ii)  link \ninvestments  with  reforms  and  continued  institutional  strengthening,  (iii)  provide  continuous \ncapacity-building  support  toward  handing  over  the  management  of  water  schemes  to  local \nauthorities  and  community-based  organizations,  and  (iv)  incorporate  greater  consultation  and \nparticipatory  processes  into  project  design  and  implementation. 17 Lessons  learned  from  the \nongoing LGIIP include the need to (i) integrate multiple subprojects in the same areas to create \ndiscernable  development \ninfrastructure \nimprovement,  (iii)  identify  and  prepare  subprojects  early,  and  (iv)  engage  consultants  for  the \ndesign  and  supervision  of  subprojects  to  augment  the  capacity  of  local  authorities.  These \nrecommendations were considered in designing the project. \n\nfocus  on  social  and  economic \n\nimpacts, \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  project \n\nis  consistent  with \n\nthe  second  pillar\u2014achieving  socially \n\n \ninclusive \n10. \ndevelopment\u2014and  the  urban  sector  road  map  of  ADB\u2019s  Sri  Lanka  country  partnership \nstrategy.18 The  project  will  address  priority  issues  of  the  strategy  including  (i)  better  service \ndelivery  through  decentralized  decision-making;  (ii)  improved  basic  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure,  particularly  in  regions  that  lag  in  development;  and  (iii)  strengthened  local \nauthority capacity to improve revenue collection. Governance, including capacity development \nand gender mainstreaming, which are crosscutting themes in ADB\u2019s strategy, is included in the \nproject design. \n \n\n                                                \n15 Amendments  are  being  considered  to  the  Municipal  Councils  Ordinance,  Urban  Councils  Ordinance,  and \n\nPradeshiya  Sabhas Act. \n\n16 This  process  has  been  supported  by  the  project  preparatory  TA,  Sector  Development  Plan:  Local  Government \n\nDevelopment Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17 ADB.  2010.

The  project  will  be  implemented  in  less-developed  areas  in  seven  provinces, \nexcluding the Northern and Eastern provinces. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have the following outputs. \n\nC. \n \n12. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Improved  local  infrastructure  and  basic  services  delivery.  In  this \ncomponent,  social  and  economic  infrastructure  in  less-developed  areas  will  be  improved  by \nparticipating local authorities, in line with the second pillar of the sector development plan. The \nproject  will  adopt  a  bottom\u2013up,  demand-driven  approach,  whereby  priority  subprojects  will  be \nidentified,  proposed,  implemented,  and  managed  by  local  authorities.  About  100  pradeshiya \nsabhas selected by the government will  first have to submit a reform plan approved through a \ncouncil resolution, which will be reviewed and confirmed by the MLGPC in consultation with the \nprovincial councils to ensure that the minimum reform requirements are met (footnote 10). Then \nthey will be qualified for the provision of a capital grant under this component for infrastructure \nimprovement.  Each  reform  plan  will  present  the  clear  commitment  of  the  local  authority  to  (i) \nimprove  service  delivery  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  local  environmental  improvement;  (ii) \nstreamline  taxation,  licensing,  and  approval  systems  and  processes;19 (iii)  ensure  the  effective \nmanagement  of  the  assets,  including  those  to  be  created  under  the  project;  and  (iv)  improve \nsystems and management. The implementation of each reform plan will be closely monitored by \nthe project management unit (PMU) in the MLGPC and subproject coordination units (SPCUs) \nin  provincial  councils.  The  successful  implementation  of  reforms  under  such  reform  plans  is  a \nkey factor in determining budgetary support for local authorities. \n\n \n\n \n\n14. \nEligible  subprojects  include  (i)  environmental  infrastructure  such  as  water  supply  and \nsanitation  (including  sewerage),  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  (ii)  economic \ninfrastructure  such  as  roads  and  bridges  (including  suspension  bridges);  (iii)  public  health \ninfrastructure such as maternity and health-care centers; and (iv) other local authority facilities \nsuch  as  public  markets.  To  strengthen  the  focus  of  the  project,  other  facilities  under  the \nresponsibility  of  local  authorities,  such  as  local  authority  office  buildings,  libraries,  and \ncrematoriums,  are  generally  not  accepted  and  may  be  approved  only  under  special \ncircumstances  and  if  clearly  justified.  Subprojects  will  be  screened  initially  by  the  SPCUs  to \nensure  conformity  with  the  provincial  physical  development  plan  and  subproject  selection \ncriteria  before  they  will  be  endorsed  by  the  PMU.20 The  PMU  will  engage  several  teams  of \ndesign and supervision consultants to ensure the quality of work. \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Local  government  policy  reform  and  capacity  building  support.  This \ncomponent  will  assist  the  implementation  of  the  first  pillar  of  the  sector  development  plan \n(reform  advancement)  by  supporting  (i)  local  authorities\u2019  institutionalizing  business  process \nreengineering,  including  the  implementation  of  relevant  bylaws  and  regulations,  with  capacity \ndevelopment  support  provided  to  the  local  authorities, 21  and  (ii)  the  development  of  an  IT \n\n                                                \n19 (i)  Assessment  and  business  taxes  and  the  collection  of  rental  fees,  (ii)  business  and  trade  licensing,  and  (iii) \n\npermits for constructing buildings and land transactions. \n\n20 Subproject Selection Criteria (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 This initiative is linked with the development of more accountable revenue management in the central government \nthrough  the  establishment  of  a  revenue  administration  management  information  system  for  the  Inland  Revenue \nDepartment in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, financed by ADB (ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nsystem,  including  updating  and  computerizing  databases  for  taxes,  licenses,  and  other \ninformation, as well as developing financial accounting and asset-management systems mainly \nin  participating  pradeshiya  sabhas  for  more  efficient  and  citizen-friendly  administration.22 This \nwill  facilitate  local  authorities\u2019  implementation  of  reforms,  particularly  for  streamlining  taxation, \nlicensing,  approval  systems  and  processes,  and  improving  financial  management  including \nrevenue  enhancement  in  the  medium  term.  Analytical  and  implementation  support  will  be \nprovided  through  capacity  development  TA  (para.  20).  Implementation  performance  will  be \nevaluated  under  the  project  and  be  the  basis  for  the  government\u2019s  decisions  on  scaling  up \nfurther assistance. \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Project  management  and  administration  support.  This  component  will \nsupport the smooth and effective implementation and operation of the project. The PMU  in the \nMLGPC will manage project implementation, supported by the project management consultant. \nThe  SPCU  in  each  province  will  coordinate  and  supervise  all  project  activities,  including  the \nimplementation  of  subprojects  and  reform  plans  in  local  authorities  under  their  jurisdiction. \nTraining  programs  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  provincial  and  local \ngovernments to effectively plan development and efficiently administer local development. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n17. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $68.8  million.

The main \nactivities  will  be  (i)  proposing  business  process  reengineering through  a  review  of  current  tax, \nlicensing,  and  approval  systems  and  processes  in  local  authorities;  (ii)  drafting  bylaws  and \nregulations  governing  local  governments  to  support  business  process  reengineering;  and  (iii) \nsupporting  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  IT  system  development  in  local  authorities. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $640,000 equivalent, of which $540,000 equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will \nfinance  the  remaining  $100,000  equivalent.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  is  the  MLGPC. \nThe TA  will  undertake  the  analytical  work  and help  develop  institutional capacity  to  implement \ncomponent 2 of the project.24 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \nFeasibility studies of sample subprojects undertaken in Kolonna and Neluwa pradeshiya \n21. \nsabhas  during  project  preparation  confirmed  technical  viability,  with  due  consideration  of  local \ncapacity  to  undertake  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Complex  water  supply  subprojects \nthat  go  beyond  the  capacity  of  local  authorities  will  not  be  implemented  under  the  project. \nTechnology  selection  prioritizes  the  least-cost  option,  taking  into  account  O&M  costs,  for \nnonrevenue-generating subprojects, and training will be carried out as necessary to ensure local \nauthorities\u2019 sustainable operation of subproject outputs. \n \nB. \n \nPublic  investment  under  the  project  is  justified  because  (i)  natural  monopolies  are \n22. \ninvolved  (e.g.,  piped  water  supply  and  sewerage);  (ii)  services  and  benefits  are  public  goods \n(e.g.,  roads  and  drainage);  and  (iii)  integrated  and  coordinated  management  is  required.  The \ninfrastructure  to  be  developed  under  the  project  is  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  citizens  in \nparticipating  local  authorities.  The  economic  analysis  of  subprojects  was  conducted  for  three \nsample  subprojects  in  water  supply,  roads,  and  solid  waste  management.  Estimates  of  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  sample  subprojects  range from  17.1%  to  22.7%,  indicating \nsufficiently high economic return. The results are most sensitive to reduced benefits but robust \nagainst other downside risks, including increased capital cost, increased O&M cost, and delay in \nproject implementation. Moreover, underestimation of the economic returns is likely because the \nsubprojects have benefits that are not easily captured in numerical values.  \n \nSome  subprojects  such  as  roads  and  drainage  improvement  do  not  generate  cash \n23. \nrevenues,  while  others,  including  water  supply  and  public  markets,  generate  cash  revenues. \nTherefore,  financial  analysis  was  conducted  for  two  sample  subprojects  in  water  supply  and \npublic markets. The financial internal rates of return were estimated at 3.4% for the water supply \nsubproject  and  12.1%  for  the  public  market  subproject,  which  compared  favorably  with  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at  0.9%.  For  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects, \nthe analysis focused on local authorities\u2019 financial capacity to meet the recurrent costs required \nto operate and maintain the developed physical assets in a sustainable manner. The projected \nfinancial  position  of  sample  local  authorities  confirmed  their  financial  capacity  to  meet  O&M \ncosts and other requirements to sustain service delivery. When the PMU reviews the subproject \nrequests from local authorities, it will assess the capacity and commitment of local authorities to \nallocate adequate O&M budget to sustain service delivery. \n\n \n\n                                                \n24 Capacity Development Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8          \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nAn  assessment  of  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  undertaken  during \nproject  preparation  indicates  that  the  MLGPC  can  manage  loan  proceeds  for  project \nimplementation.  The  PMU  and  the  SPCUs  have  experience  in  financial  management  and \nprocurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements  and  have  a  satisfactory  track  record  from \nthe LGIIP. Procurement for civil works and equipment will be handled at the provincial level  to \nreduce  procurement  risks,  as  SPCUs  have  higher  capacity  and  more  experience  than  local \nauthorities. Transparency in procurement, financing, and other matters will be maximized under \nthe  project  through  such  measures  as  the  PMU\u2019s  developing  a  project  website  to  disclose \ninformation  on  the  project  to  reduce  corruption  risk  and  improve  governance.  Each  local \nauthority\u2019s  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  reform  plan,  which  includes  strengthening \nfinancial  discipline  and  enhancing  citizens\u2019  participation  in  the  local  authority\u2019s  administrative \nmatters, will help improve the accountability of local authorities. \n\n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 23). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  project  is  classified as  effective gender mainstreaming. While  women in Sri  Lanka \n26. \ngenerally  have  higher  status  than  women  in  other  developing  countries  in  South  Asia  and \nelsewhere  in  terms  of  access  to  education  and  health-care  services,  many  women  are \ndisadvantaged  owing  to  poor  roads,  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  other  public  services, \nparticularly  in  less-developed  areas  of  the  country.  Limited  access  to  safe  drinking  water \nrequires  household  members,  primarily  women  and  children,  to  spend  considerable  time  and \neffort  on  fetching  water.  Inadequate  and  poor-quality  roads  limit  poor  communities\u2019  access  to \nmarkets, health-care centers, and schools and create safety and security issues for women and \ngirls.  Subprojects  identified  in a participatory  and  inclusive manner  will  address the  immediate \nneeds  of  communities,  including  women.  A  gender  action  plan  will  be  implemented  to  ensure \ninclusiveness and address the different needs of women and vulnerable groups. By focusing its \nsupport  to  less-developed  areas  of  the  country,  the  project  will  help  redress  geographical \ninequality and contribute to balanced regional development. \n\n \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project  is  category  B  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \n27. \npeoples.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  limit  negative  impacts  through  avoidance  and \nminimization. Subprojects will have positive environmental benefits, improving local authorities\u2019 \nenvironment  and  public  health.  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mostly  related  to \nconstruction  and  are  temporary.  No  significant  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples \nimpacts are anticipated. \n\n \n28. \nAn environmental assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and an \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  have  been  prepared  for  the  project.25 Consistent  with \nthe safeguards frameworks, three initial environmental examinations were prepared for sample \nsubprojects.  They  include  environmental  management  plans  that  will  ensure  adequate \nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  impacts.  None  of  the  sample  subprojects  has  involuntary \nresettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts.  The  project  improves  on  implementation \narrangements  for  the  ongoing  LGIIP  and  will  further  build  the  executing  agency\u2019s  capacity  for \n                                                \n25 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \nsafeguard implementation through the support of consulting services. The executing agency will \nundertake  safeguard  due  diligence  on  subprojects  based  on  the  framework  documents \nprepared for the project and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n\n \n29. \nThe  safeguards  frameworks  and  initial  environmental  examinations  were  developed  in \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  and  disclosed  in  the  Kolonna  and  Neluwa  local  authorities. \nSafeguards documents were disclosed on the websites of ADB and the MLGPC. \n\n9 \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n30. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 As risks can be mitigated to a manageable \nlevel, the intended benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nEach reform plan requires local authority approval through a council \nresolution. The project management unit and the subproject \ncoordination units will closely monitor the implementation of reform \nplans. The successful implementation of reforms under the reform \nplan is a key factor in determining budgetary support for a local \nauthority. Subprojects will be selected through a participatory \nmechanism that uses a consultation and participation plan to reflect \ncommunity needs.a \nThe technical design will take into account the capacity of local \nauthorities. Commitment by local authorities to provide an operation \nand maintenance budget will be confirmed up front. Capacity \ndevelopment and training programs will be implemented. \nThe government is highly committed to advancing local reform. \n\nRisks \nLack of local authority \ncommitment to implement the \nreform plan \n \nCommitment to subprojects and \ntheir priority affected by change \nin political power \n\nLack of financial and technical \ncapacity in local authorities for \noperation and maintenance  \n\nAlternative funding sources \nmade available without reform \ncommitment and implementation \nActs and ordinances governing \nlocal governments not amended \nin a timely and appropriate \nmanner \n\nThe government is highly committed to making necessary \namendments to advance local government reform.
