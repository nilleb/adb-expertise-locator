The  EAL  will  help  to \nmitigate  the  adverse  social  and  economic  impacts  of  the  cyclone  on  vulnerable  people  and \nhouseholds.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nDescription  of  the  emergency.  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston,  the  second  most  powerful \nstorm on record (after Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines in 2013), struck Fiji on 20 February \n2016.  The  cyclone  killed  44  people  and  left  a  trail  of  destruction  across  large  parts  of  Fiji.  As \nmany  as  540,000  people  (62%  of  the  population)  were  affected  by  the  disaster.  An  estimated \n30,369  houses  (22%  of  households)  were  destroyed  or  damaged,  leaving  approximately \n131,000  people  residing  in  temporary  shelters  or  under  tarpaulins.  The  cyclone  damaged  495 \nschools  and  88  health \nfacilities,  disrupted  basic  public  services  (power,  water,  and \ncommunications), and destroyed food crops and livelihoods. \n \n3. \nTotal  damage  and  loss  is  estimated  to  be  $1.42  billion\u2014equivalent  to  31%  of  gross \ndomestic  product (GDP). This  is  based  on  the  post-disaster  needs  assessment (PDNA) jointly \nprepared  by  the  government  and  development  partners.  Among  the  social  and  productive \nsectors,  damage  and  loss  was  especially  concentrated  in  the  housing,  education,  and \nagriculture sectors (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Disaster Damage and Loss Estimates  \n($ million) \n\nTotal \nItem  \n400.15 \nProductive sectors \n259.32 \nAgriculture, livestock, forestry, and fishing \n68.30 \nCommerce and manufacturing \n15.06 \nMining \n57.48 \nTourism \n472.56 \nSocial sectors \n93.93 \nEducation \n6.67 \nHealth \n371.96 \nHousing \n118.32 \nInfrastructure sectors \n19.67 \nElectricity \n11.82 \nWater and sanitation \n86.83 \nTransport and communication \n430.26 \nCrosscutting sectors \n2.58 \nCulture \n15.08 \nDisaster risk management \n412.60b \nEnvironment \n1,421.29 \n \na  Initial  estimates  of  education  damages  of  $33  million  have  been  revised \nupwards based on subsequent substantive assessments carried out by the Fiji \nInstitute of Engineers.  \n\nDamage \n115.69 \n38.89 \n34.84 \n5.51 \n36.45 \n453.41 \n       90.4a \n3.68 \n359.33 \n99.04 \n15.78 \n8.09 \n75.17 \n114.67 \n2.45 \n0.97 \n111.25 \n782.81 \n\nLoss \n284.46 \n220.43 \n33.45 \n9.55 \n21.03 \n19.15 \n3.53 \n2.99 \n12.63 \n19.28 \n3.89 \n3.73 \n11.66 \n315.59 \n0.13 \n14.11 \n301.35 \n  638.48 \n\nb  The  estimate  of  environmental  damage  and  loss  includes  valuation  of \n\nTotal \n\necosystem functions that are not included in the official national accounts. \n\nSource: Government of Fiji.

Initial estimates for the impact on GDP were that Tropical Cyclone \nWinston would cut economic growth by 2.5% in 2016. However, immediate relief efforts\u2014which \nincluded the Fiji National Provident Fund permitting members to withdraw up to $2,400 of their \nsavings to help meet housing recovery needs, and the government\u2019s supplemental funding for \nsocial protection programs\u2014provided a boost to consumer spending and to GDP overall. With \nrecovery  and  reconstruction  activity  already  under  way,  the  economy  is  expected  to  grow  by \n3.6% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. \n \n\nTable 2: Selected Macroeconomic Indicatorsa  \n\nPre-Cyclone \n\nPost-Cyclone \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n(8.2) \n\n(7.8) \n\n(6.2) \n\n(5.4) \n\n(6.5) \n\n(9.8) \n\n(7.9) \n\n5,267 \n\n2018c \n\n4.0 \n2.8 \n\n5.3 \n0.5 \n\n4.6 \n2.9 \n\n3.2 \n2.5 \n\n3.1 \n2.8 \n\n3.8 \n2.0 \n\n54.6 \n49.8 \n\n62.8 \n54.8 \n\n      3.2 \n2.6 \n\n5,061 \n3.6 \n3.0 \n\n2017c \n  \n  \n\n29.1 \n34.5 \n19.9 \n14.6 \n(5.0) \n\n28.2 \n32.8 \n21.1 \n11.7 \n(4.6) \n\n29.2 \n32.5 \n17.7 \n14.8 \n(3.3) \n\n29.0 \n36.0 \n21.6 \n14.4 \n(6.4) \n\n29.1 \n33.5 \n19.2 \n14.3 \n(4.4) \n\n27.0 \n27.6 \n19.5 \n8.1 \n(0.6) \n\n29.3 \n34.4 \n20.8 \n13.6 \n(5.1) \n\n  29.2 \n  32.2 \n  18.1 \n  14.1 \n  (2.9) \n\n27.6 \n31.8 \n20.3 \n11.5 \n(4.3) \n  \n(7.2) \n\n2014  2015b  2016c  2017c  2018c  2016c \n  \n  \n\n \n2013 \n  \n  \n4,196  4,532  4,782  4,765  5,183  5,381  4,872 \n2.4 \n2.1 \n\nItem \nReal economy \n  \nGDP ($ million) \nReal GDP growth (%) \nConsumer price growth (%, period \naverage) \nFiscal accounts (% of GDP) \nRevenue (% of GDP) \nExpenditure (% of GDP) \n    Current (% of GDP) \n    Capital (% of GDP) \nOverall balance (% of GDP) \nBalance of payments  \nCurrent account balance (% of \nGDP) \nImports (% of GDP) \nExports (% of GDP) \nGross reserves ($ million) \n    In months of imports (months) \nExternal debt (% of GDP) \nExternal debt ($ million) \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na  Calendar year. \nb  Estimated. \nc  Projected. \nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics, Reserve Bank of Fiji, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5. \nTropical Cyclone Winston will adversely affect Fiji\u2019s medium-term fiscal position and the \ngovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  planned  fiscal  consolidation  measures.  The  government \nhad been anticipating reducing expenditure by approximately 1.5% of GDP between 2015 and \n2018,  after  significant  expansions  between  2011  and  2014  to  provide  free  primary  education \nand  improve  road  infrastructure  and  water  supply.2 However,  the  need  for  significant  recovery \nand reconstruction spending will lead to further fiscal pressures in 2016 and 2017. Following the \ncyclone,  the  government  immediately  reprioritized  spending  to  meet  emergency  and  early \nrecovery  needs.  As  a result, the fiscal  deficit  is  expected  to increase to 6.4%  of GDP  in  2016 \n(from  5.1%  prior  to  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston).3 As  the  recovery  spending  winds  down,  the \ndeficit  is  forecast  to  moderate  to  5.0%  in  2017  before  declining  to  2.9%  in  2018  as  fiscal \nconsolidation gets under way. \n \n\n61.6 \n74.2 \n56.6 \n52.8 \n990  1,010  1,062  1,136  1,183  1,242 \n5.2 \n5.3 \n4.9 \n21.1 \n19.5 \n22.1 \n885  1,000 \n\n71.8 \n57.3 \n942 \n3.8 \n4.5 \n5.1 \n20.9 \n22.8 \n20.2 \n999  1,056  1,064  1,073  1,156 \n\n  65.7 \n  53.1 \n   988 \n   4.3 \n   21.1 \n1,173 \n\n79.0 \n58.9 \n959 \n3.5 \n22.0 \n1,164 \n\n4.8 \n21.0 \n\n68.5 \n55.7 \n\n74.6 \n56.9 \n\n  (8.5) \n\n                                                \n2  In April 2016, the government announced a long-planned change to the fiscal year from a calendar year to one that \n\nruns from August 1 to July 31. This analysis is based on calendar years. \n\n3  This figure does not include anticipated revenue from the planned sale of public assets. \n \n\n\f3 \n \n\nPoverty  incidence.  The  cyclone  will  put  at  risk  recent  gains  in  reducing  poverty \n6. \ncountrywide. Prior to the cyclone, the incidence of poverty using national poverty lines had fallen \nfrom 35% in 2003 to 28% in 2013.4 The highest per capita damage and loss was incurred along \nthe  northern coast  of the  main  island of  Viti  Levu;  the southern  coast  of  Vanua  Levu;  and the \noutlying Koro, Lau, and Lomaviti island groups\u2014all areas of Fiji which have a high incidence of \npoverty. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that many people  have left the affected areas \nfor safer locations, placing increased pressure on extended families and social services in urban \nareas. In addition, poor people across the country face increasing hardship as a result of sharp \nincreases in food prices, particularly agricultural produce. This includes the large concentration \nof poor people living in informal settlements around the major urban areas of Suva, Nadi, and \nLabasa.  \n \nWomen  face  particular  challenges  since  deprivation  and  hardship  affect  men  and \n7. \nwomen differently. While water, shelter, and food are basic necessities for all, a recent study in \nFiji found that more women than men identify electricity, sanitation facilities, and personal care \nas  being  important  to  their  welfare. 5  This  suggests  that,  with  many  homes  substantially \ndamaged and without basic services, women are likely to be facing greater hardship than men \nin  the  aftermath  of  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston  by,  for  example,  having  to  collect  firewood  for \ncooking and difficulty in accessing drinking water, basic sanitation, and sanitary items. \n \nGovernment disaster management architecture.  Fiji has a strong national structure \n8. \nfor  disaster  risk  management.  This  consists  of  the  National  Disaster  Management  Council, \nNational Disaster Management Office, and disaster management committees at the provincial \nand  district  levels.  The  country  also  has  developed  a  Natural  Disaster  Management  Plan \n(1998),  Natural  Disaster  Management  Act  (1998),  and  Standard  Operating  Procedures  for \nDisaster Response (2010).   \n \n9. \nThe  National  Disaster  Management  Council  declared  a  state  of  natural  disaster  on  20 \nFebruary  2016.    The  government,  including  the  armed  forces  and  police,  responded  to  the \ndisaster  through  rapid  mobilization  of  rescue,  evacuation,  and  relief  operations  that  provided \nbasic food supplies, water, and medical assistance. \n \nIn  February,  the  government,  acting  on  advice  provided  by  the  World  Bank,  made \n10. \navailable  $10  million  in  post-disaster  social  protection  payments  to  support  vulnerable \nhouseholds and individuals most likely to fall into poverty. This support was provided through \nthe  expansion  of  three  existing  social  protection  programs  including  the  poverty  benefits \nscheme,  which  targets  the  poorest  10%  of  households;  the  social  pension  scheme,  which \ntargets  people  over  the  age  of  68  who  are  not  covered  by  the  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund; \nand  the  care  and  protection  scheme,  which  targets  vulnerable  households  with  children \n(single parents, abandoned spouses, death of breadwinner). In total, 44,169 people benefited \nfrom top-up assistance under these programs (Table 3).6 The World Bank is providing general \nbudget  support  to  the  government,  including  support  for  these  programs  through  a \ndevelopment policy operation.  \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n4  Fiji Bureau of Statistics. 2015.

The  government-led \nefforts  were  undertaken  with  strong  support  from  the  international  community.  Immediate \nemergency  efforts  were  supported  with  military  logistical  assistance  primarily  from  Australia \nand  New  Zealand  but  with  support  also  from  France,  India,  Indonesia,  and  Tonga.  As  of  1 \nJune  2016,  international  donors  had  pledged  assistance  valued  at  $68  million,  with \napproximately 75% of this being in kind and 25% in cash. Major contributors include Australia, \nNew  Zealand,  and  the  European  Union,  with  contributions  also  from  a  wide  range  of  other \ncountries and organizations. Private businesses also contributed approximately $5 million for \nrelief support to victims.7 \n \nOn  29  March  2016,  the  government,  with  the  support  of  development  partners \n12. \nincluding  the  European  Union,  the  World  Bank,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  a \nnumber  of  regional  agencies,  initiated  a  PDNA.  The  PDNA,  through  18  sector  assessment \nteams,  built  on  initial  and  detailed  sector  damage  assessments  undertaken  by  eight  national \nclusters  (led  by  government  ministries):  (i)  health  and  nutrition;  (ii)  water,  sanitation,  and \nhygiene;  (iii)  education;  (iv)  safety  and  protection;  (v)  shelter;  (vi)  public  works  and  utilities; \n(vii) logistics; and (viii) food security and agriculture. The PDNA examined damage to physical \nassets; losses suffered because of change in economic flows; and assessed priority repair and \nreconstruction needs. \n \n13. \nAlmost half of the estimated immediate damage was private housing. The government \nestimates  that  11,989  houses  were  completely  destroyed  and  a  further  18,380  houses \npartially damaged by Tropical  Cyclone Winston. In Fiji, the majority of rural households have \nlimited  access  to  affordable  private  insurance  for  cyclone-related  damage  to  houses  and \nlimited  access  to  savings  to  reconstruct  and  repair  homes.  With  more  than  130,000  people \nliving  in  temporary  shelters,  on  9  April  2016,  the  Prime  Minister  announced  the  first  phase \n($34.5  million)  of  the  Help  for  Homes  initiative.  The  aim  of  the  initiative  is  to  improve  the \nresilience  of  the  Fiji  people  to  disasters  such  as  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston  by  advising  and \nproviding assistance to households to \u201cbuild back better\u201d and to a standard of home that will \nwithstand at least a category 3 cyclone.   \n \n14. \nThe  initiative  provides  housing  grants  through  a  voucher  program  to  people  with \nhousehold incomes below $24,000 (F$50,000) per annum whose homes have been destroyed \nor  partially  damaged  by  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston. 8  The  vouchers  can  be  redeemed  for \ndesignated construction materials needed to repair  or rebuild homes. Following vetting by the \nDepartment  of  Social  Welfare,  eligible  households  have  been  issued  with  e-cards  to  hold  the \n\n                                                \n7  Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  According  to  limited  available  income  information  (Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  2008\u20132009),  the \nurban  average  household  income  was  F$23,000  per  annum  and  rural  incomes  were  F$11,068  per  annum.  It  is, \ntherefore, anticipated that almost all affected households will be eligible to receive a materials grant. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n \n\nsmall grant funds. The value of the vouchers depends on the extent of damage to houses, with \nhouseholds  eligible  for  up  to  $3,300  (sufficient  to  construct  one  category  3  cyclone  resistant \nroom) where houses have been completely destroyed, and between  $717 and $1,435 where \nhouses  have  been  partially  damaged.  No  involuntary  settlement  of  people  from  their  land  is \nplanned under the scheme.9 \n \n15. \nIn  May,  with  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  partners,  the  government  prepared  a \nbudgeted disaster recovery framework (DRF) for Tropical Cyclone Winston. This is the first time \nfollowing  a  disaster  in Fiji  that  such  a framework  has  been  prepared. The  DRF highlights four \nkey  priority  disaster  recovery  areas  and  the  budgeted  costs  of  disaster  recovery  over  2016\u2013\n2018:  (i)  rebuilding  homes,  (ii)  restoring  livelihoods,  (iii)  repairing  and  strengthening  critical \ninfrastructure (education, health, transport, communications), and (iv) building resilience.10   \n \n16. \nThe DRF (Table 4) estimates the total cost of recovery and reconstruction activities to be \napproximately  $434.1  million  for  the  2-year  recovery  period  from  mid-2016  to  mid-2018.  The \ngovernment anticipates being able to finance approximately $131.3 million (equivalent to 30% of \nthe total program costs) partly from reallocations and partly from fast disbursing financing from \npartners  like  ADB.  However,  this  still  leaves  a  significant  financing  gap  of  $294.0  million  for \nwhich additional external financial support is required.  \n \n\nTable 4: Disaster Recovery Framework Budget \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nGovernment \n\nDonor \n\nFinancing \nGap \n53.5 \n53.5 \n59.3 \n18.4 \n21.0 \n3.5 \n16.3 \n0.0 \n169.9 \n\nTotal Budget    \n2016\u20132018 \n88.0 \n88.0 \n114.3 \n24.2 \n25.3 \n3.5 \n61.0 \n0.3 \n220.5 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n4.8 \n4.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.3 \n5.8 \n\n34.5 \n34.5 \n50.3 \n1.3 \n4.3 \n0.0 \n44.7 \n0.0 \n44.8 \n\nPriority 1: Rebuilding homes \n    Housing (public and private) \nPriority 2: Restoring livelihoods \n    Agriculture, livestock, forestry, and fisheries \n    Commerce and industry \n    Tourism \n    Employment, livelihoods, and social protection \n    Household and community livelihood \nPriority 3: Repairing and strengthening critical \ninfrastructure \n    Education \n    Health \n    Transport \n    Water and sanitation \n    Electricity \n    Communication \n    Environment (solid waste management) \nPriority 4: Building resilience \n    Culture and heritage \n    Disaster risk reduction and management \n    Environment (restoration of ecosystem) \nTotal: Priorities 1\u20134 \na  Initial estimates of education damages of $33 million have been revised upwards based on \n     subsequent substantive assessments carried out by the Fiji Institute of Engineers.  \nb    Amounts committed to date.

ADB \nproposes  to  provide  an  EAL  of  $50  million  to  assist  the  government  to  finance  the  additional \ndisaster-related recovery expenditures in the FY2017 budget.  The government has requested \nADB financing primarily to assist with reconstructing and building back better  495 schools that \nwere  damaged  by  Tropical  Cyclone Winston. Of  this total,  219 schools have been  extensively \ndamaged  and  government  anticipates  being  able  to  rehabilitate  approximately  60%  of  these \nduring FY2017. All new buildings will be required to adhere to stringent standards to maximize \ntheir ability to withstand natural disasters. In addition government proposes to use a significant \nportion  of  the  loan  to  finance  expenditures  for  the  Help  for  Homes  program.  This  follows  a \nrequest by the government to both ADB and the World Bank on 11 April 2016 for fast-disbursing \nemergency finance. In preparing this operation, ADB has worked closely with the World  Bank, \nwhich will seek Board approval for $50 million of financing for its policy-based operation on 30 \nJune.11 \n \n19. \nThe EAL complements other support that ADB has provided following Tropical Cyclone \nWinston,  including  a  $2  million  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund.  The \ngrant agreement was signed by the vice-president of Operations 2 during a visit to Fiji on 28 \nFebruary 2016 and was disbursed on 29 February 2016. ADB also mobilized $0.3 million from \nthe Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility to bring a team from Tonga Power (with which ADB \nworked  previously  on  cyclone  reconstruction  in  Tonga)  to  assist  the  Fiji  Electricity  Authority \nrestore  power  lines.  ADB  is  exploring  possibilities  for  financing  from  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction to support the recovery effort. \n \n20. \nAn  EAL  is  considered  to  be  the  appropriate  response  instrument.  It  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s overall engagement with Fiji as set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 \napproved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  in  November  2014. 12  The  EAL  will  specifically \ncontribute  to  achieving  the  country  partnership  objective  of  reducing  volatility  and  building \nresilience. The proposed loan is also consistent with the six characteristics for an EAL set out \nin  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  as  follows:  (i)  help  rebuild  high-priority \nphysical assets and restore economic, social, and governance activities after emergencies; (ii) \nmitigate immediate losses to priority assets, capacity, or productivity rather than provide relief \nor  comprehensive  reconstruction;  (iii)  provide  immediate  short-term  transitional  assistance; \n\n                                                \n11  World  Bank.

The  outcome  will  be  to  mitigate  the \n\n(iv)  the  loan  is  restricted  to  the  transition  phase  and  is  to  be  used  exclusively  for  priority \nrehabilitation; (v) the loan is linked with and complements humanitarian relief efforts by other \ndevelopment  partners  to  ease  the  transition  from  relief  to  normal  development;  and  (vi)  the \nloan may include quick-disbursing components but is not a policy-based loan.13 \n \nB. \n \n21. \nimmediate impact of Tropical Cyclone Winston on poor and vulnerable households. \n  \nC. \n \nThe  EAL  will  provide  $50  million  in  immediate  short-term  financial  support  so  that \n22. \ndisaster  recovery  reconstruction  programs\u2014including  school  rehabilitation  and  disaster-\nresponsive housing assistance programs\u2014are adequately financed within fiscal constraints.  \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  government  has  requested  an  EAL  of  $50  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, straight-line \nrepayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nyear,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.    Based  on \nthis,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  12.75  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to \nADB. \n \n24. \nSimilar to ADB\u2019s EAL to the Philippines following Typhoon Yolanda, the EAL will use a \nsingle  quick-disbursing  component  equal  to  100%  of  the  loan.14 Fast-disbursing  financing  will \nallow the government to provide direct transitional social safety net support to poor and affected \nhouseholds,  consistent with ADB\u2019s  emergency assistance  policies  and as the government  has \ndone  to  date  through  expanded  social  protection  programs  and  the  housing  assistance \nprogram. 15  This  reflects  the  urgency  of  the  situation  in  Fiji  and  the  need  to  mitigate  the \nimmediate  economic  and  social  impacts.  International  studies  show  that  rapid  response  is \ncritical to addressing poverty and restoring livelihoods.16  \n \n25. \nAlso  similar  to  ADB\u2019s  EAL  to  the  Philippines  following  Typhoon  Yolanda,  the  Board  is \nrequested  to  waive  the  requirement  under  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  for \nsuch  quick-disbursing  components  to  finance  only  a  list  of  identified  imports  necessary  for \neffective  recovery  assistance. 17 The  EAL  for  Fiji  is  intended  to  help  finance  government\u2019s \ndisaster  recovery  expenditures,  especially  for  school  reconstruction  and  the  Help  for  Homes \ninitiative.  Given  the  EAL  will  primarily  support  the  financing  needs  of  these  programs,  rather \nthan direct procurement of goods, it is not practicable to limit financing to a specific positive list \nof imports. \n \n\n                                                \n13   ADB. 2004.

Disbursement and audit will be done in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram  Loans.18 Subject  to  Board  approval,  the  government  has  requested  that  funds  be \ndisbursed in the first week of August 2016, at the start of the FY2017 financial year based on \nborrowing  authority  gained  from  Parliament  in  the  budget  submitted  on  22  June  2016.

Fiji\u2019s  annual \nnational  budgets  incorporate  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  that  includes  2-year  forward \ntargets  for  overall  revenue,  expenditure,  fiscal  balance,  and  public  debt.  Financial  reports \nincluding  the  classification  of  the  budget  are  Government  Finance  Statistics  compliant,  and \nthe  government  works  closely  with  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  and  the \nInternational  Monetary Fund  on capacity  building for  budgeting,  accounting, macroeconomic, \nand  Government  Finance  Statistics  standards.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government. 19  The  Strategic \nPlanning Office will provide coordination, monitoring, and oversight for the EAL. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  incidence  of  poverty  is  expected  to  temporarily  rise  as  a  result  of  the  economic \nand  social  costs  of  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston.  The  EAL  aims  to  help  mitigate  the  adverse \nimpact  on  affected  communities  by  supporting  the  government\u2019s  FY2017  public  expenditure \nprogram  linked  to  key  disaster  recovery  initiatives,  especially  for  school  reconstruction,  and \nthe Help for Homes initiative.
