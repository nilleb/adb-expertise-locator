It  aims  to  expand  initial  developments  undertaken  by  the  Government  of \nBhutan at these airports. The project is to strengthen safety and security, and enhance capacity, \nincluding  priority  needs  for  securing  the  airport  perimeter;  expanding  terminal  space,  air  craft \nparking apron, and taxiway; improving runways; and installing aeronautical communication and \nnavigation  aid  equipment. 2  These  improvements  are  targeted  to  meet  the  requirements  of \ncurrent and anticipated aviation activities in the country, and help continue the record of safety. \nOverall,  it  will  support  the  government\u2019s  plan  to  develop  a  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  air \ntransport system connecting urban and rural centers to help overcome the current limitations of \nroad transport and improve accessibility to less-developed regions of the country. This will help \nfacilitate  greater  and  more  equitable  coverage  of  potential  benefits  from  tourism  growth, \nstimulate private sector development, and generate employment opportunities for the poor. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nLandlocked  Bhutan  faces  unique  development  challenges  and  opportunities.  The \nexpansion  and  maintenance  of  physical  infrastructure  is  critical  for  increasing  the  country\u2019s \nmeasure  of  gross  national  happiness.  The  country\u2019s  small  population  of  about  700,000, 3 \nmountainous terrain, and formidable weather condition mean that achieving economies of scale \nin  service  delivery  is  difficult,  and  building  and  maintaining  vital  infrastructure,  particularly  the \nroad network, is costly. Consequently, high external and domestic transport costs, and lack or \nlimited accessibility have constrained the country\u2019s economic and social development. \n \n4. \nParo International Airport (PIA), Bhutan\u2019s only operating airport until recently and still the \nonly  one  providing  international  air  access,  is  located  near  the  capital  city  of  Thimphu  in  the \nwestern  region.  Due  to  the  lack  of  domestic  air  connectivity,  other  regions  of  the  country\u2014\nparticularly in the center, south, and, east\u2014have limited access to regional and global markets. \nThe tourism industry, for instance, a substantial economic contributor, is much better developed \nin  the  west  compared  with  other  regions.  This  imbalance  in  accessibility\u2014to  opportunity, \nenterprise,  markets,  and  services\u2014has  been  an  obstacle  to  achieving  broad-based  economic \ngrowth, which is one of the government\u2019s major development goals. \n \nFollowing  the  country\u2019s  vision  statement, 4  the  government\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n5. \n(2008\u20132013) highlights the development objectives for the country\u2019s transport system, focusing \non enhancing connectivity to facilitate greater coverage of basic social services, including health \nand education in isolated regions, and improving transport efficiency\u2014reducing travel time and \ncost\u2014to  boost  domestic  trade  and  cross-border  transport.  This  will  stimulate  private  sector \ndevelopment and generate employment opportunities for the poor. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  conduct  a \nfeasibility  study  and  due  diligence.

Basic Statistics 2011. Manila. \n4  Government of Bhutan. 1999. Bhutan 2020: A Vision of Peace, Prosperity and Happiness. Thimphu. \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\n \n6. \nTo  help  achieve  these  objectives,  the  government  decided  to  develop  a  safe,  reliable, \nand  efficient  network  of  domestic  air  transport  connecting  urban  and  rural  centers  to  help \novercome current limitations of road transport, increase accessibility, and promote tourism and \nhigh-value  agriculture  in  less-developed  regions.  In  keeping  with  this  strategy  and  based  on \nairport  master  plans  and  feasibility  studies,  in  2010  the  government  selected  and  started \ndeveloping three domestic airports\u2014upgrading an existing airfield at Yonphula in the east, and \nconstructing new airfields at Bumthang in the center, and Gelephu in the south.5 By December \n2011,  domestic  flights,  although  limited  in  frequency,  started  operating  at  Bumthang  and \nYonphula, and flight operations at Gelephu are expected to start during 2012. However, due to \nlimited available funding, the current facilities at these airports are very basic and only for initial \nair operation and passenger accommodation. Deficiencies include inadequate or lack of aircraft \nparking apron and taxiways, runway  wearing course and drainage, communication equipment, \nsecurity fencing, and other support facilities. \n \n7. \nOverall, air transport activity in Bhutan is set to increase substantially as a result of the \ngovernment\u2019s continued effort to brand and market tourist attractions in the country and the new \ninitiative  under  way  to  introduce  domestic  air  links.  In  2010,  the  air  passenger  volume  at  PIA \nreached 127,181 passengers per annum (ppa), tripling from about 33,890 in 2000. Based on the \nupdated air traffic forecast, if unconstrained by capacity,6 total air passenger traffic could grow to \nabout 491,200 ppa by 2020, of which approximately 12% (59,900 passengers) would be carried \non  the  new  domestic  services.  By  2030, total  ppa  is forecast to  increase  on  an  unconstrained \nbasis  to  915,100  ppa, 7  of  which  domestic  passengers  would  account  for  17.4%  (159,600 \npassengers). \n \n8. \nIn view of the anticipated increase in aircraft movements and passenger volume, current \ndeficiencies must be addressed, and initial developments undertaken by the government at the \nthree domestic airports expanded to strengthen safety and security, and enhance capacity. The \nproject  will  include  (i)  improving  air  operation  safety  by  providing  required  air  rescue  and \nfirefighting system facilities, aeronautical communication and navigation, and runway drainage; \n(ii)  strengthening  security  with  an  airport  cordon  around  the  perimeter;  and  (iii)  expanding \ncapacity  for  terminal  space,  aircraft  parking  apron,  and  taxiway.  The  improvements  were \nprioritized based on development needs identified in updated master plans for the three airports, \nprojected traffic forecasts in terms of peak hour aircraft movements and passenger volume, as \nwell  as  updated  assessment  of  current  developments  and  priorities  for  air  transport  in  the \ncountry.8 By improving safety, security, and capacity at the three domestic airports, the project \nwill  help  ensure  operation  of  aircrafts  with  adequate  capacity  for  continued  passenger  traffic \ngrowth and improved service and safety. \n \n9. \nIn  keeping  with  lessons  from  similar  projects  in  the  region,  regulatory  and  institutional \ncapacity  is  critical  to  ensuring  sustainable  development  of  air  transport  in  the  country.  An \nassessment of the organizational and management capacity of the Department of Civil Aviation \n\n                                                \n5  Airport Development Programme and Master Plans for Yonphula and Bumthang under the Bhutan Aviation Sector \nCapacity  Development  Project  (2006\u20132008)  financed  by  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency, and the Gelephu Site Feasibility Study (2008) financed by the government. \n\n6  The  unconstrained  scenario  assumes  the  PIA  runway  maintains  the  current  peak  hour  capacity  of  4  aircraft \n\nmovements per hour, and the tourist infrastructure is able to accommodate the increasing number of tourists. \n\n7  The  unconstrained  scenario  assumes  improvements  at  PIA  increase  the  peak  hour  capacity  from  4  aircraft \n\nmovements per hour to 5 by 2022, and to 6 by 2027. \n\n8  Previous airport master plans and feasibility studies were reviewed and updated under the technical assistance for \n\nthe Air Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project (footnote 2).  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n(DCA) (footnote 2), including policy dialog with the government regarding the current regulatory \nframework,  identified  needed  improvements.  These  include  updating  civil  aviation  acts  and \nregulations to  reflect  current  needs,  developing a  strategy  to  adapt  a  regulatory  and operating \nframework based on international standards, and improving human resource development with \ntechnical  training  in  the  critical  areas  of  regulatory  oversight  and  airport  operations.  To  help \nmeet these needs, capacity development technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  will  be  implemented  starting  in  2012.9 It  will  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  air  transport \nregulatory and operating performance, and help ensure that the benefits from the project\u2014the \nfirst ADB-financed investment in air transport in Bhutan\u2014will be optimized and sustainable. \n \n10. \nThe  project  and  its  outcome  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  objective  set  out  in  the \ninterim  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132013:  to  assist the government  in  achieving  broad-\nbased  economic growth.10 It  will  enhance the  country\u2019s  air  transport  connectivity,  help improve \naccess  to  regional  and  global  markets  throughout  the  country,  and  support  tourism  growth  in \nless-developed regions. The project is included in the Bhutan country operations business plan, \n2012\u20132014.11 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nIn  support  of  the  country  partnership  strategy,  the  project  impact  will  be  improved  air \ntransport connectivity. The immediate outcome will be improved safety, security, and capacity at \nthree domestic airports in Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe outputs will be improved infrastructure at the three domestic airports, comprising (i) \nperimeter fencing of 4 kilometers (km), runway asphalt overlay of 36,000 square meters (m2), a \ngeneral service and maintenance vehicle, and all-weather access road of 1 km in Bumthang; (ii) \nperimeter  fencing  of  4  km  including  security  gate  and guard  house,  air  rescue  and  firefighting \nservice support facilities, a general service and maintenance vehicle, all-weather access road of \n2 km, expansion of terminal area of 1,000 m2, apron and taxiway of 6,000 m2, runway drainage \nsystem,  flood  protection  structures,  and  communication  and  navigation  aids  equipment  in \nGelephu; (iii) removal of small hills beside runways12, air rescue and firefighting service support \nfacilities, a general service and maintenance vehicle, and repair of runway strip drainage of 500 \nmeters in Yonphula. \n \nThe  outputs  will  be  achieved  through  key  activities  including  (i)  engagement  of  design \n13. \nand  supervision  consultant  to  prepare  detailed  engineering  design,  specifications,  bill  of \nquantities,  cost  estimates,  and bidding documents; (ii)  procurement  of contracts for  works  and \nequipment; and (iii) execution of contracts to carry out the works and install equipment. \n \n \n\n                                                \n9  ADB.  2011.

The  engineering design  will  be  based  on  site  condition  surveys  and field \ninvestigations,  optimizing  the  required  improvement  works  for  economy  and  construction \nefficiency  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  design  standards.  The  construction \nmethod will use proven technology with standard materials compatible with local conditions. To \nenhance resilience to climatic hazards and disasters, built-in civil engineering measures will be \nassessed  and  applied,  including  flood  protection  structures,  design  values  of  storm  frequency \nand  runoff,  and  drainage  systems.  Hydrological  considerations  will  be  heightened \nin \nconsultation with the government\u2019s hydro-meteorological services division.  \n \n19. \nOperation  and  maintenance. DCA\u2019s Technical Support Division, which comprises four \nsections\u2014civil, electrical, mechanical, and horticulture and beautification\u2014is currently providing \nadequate  maintenance  services  for  PIA\u2019s  airport  facilities.  With  minimum  staffing,  it  relies  on \nexternal local contractors for several maintenance functions including some major maintenance \nactivities  for  airside  facilities  such  as  the  runway,  taxiways,  and  apron.  For  current  and  future \nmaintenance  requirements  for  the  domestic  airports,  DCA  has  assigned  six \nfull-time \nmaintenance  staff\u2014two  stationed  at  each  airport  in  Bumthang  and  Yonphula,  and  two  at  the \nGelephu airport once operations begin. Additional and more specialized maintenance staff could \nbe seconded from PIA when required. Also under the project, general service and maintenance \nvehicles will be provided for each domestic airport at Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \n20. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects. 15  By  improving  safety,  security,  and  capacity  at  the  three \ndomestic airports, the project will help ensure operation of aircraft types with adequate capacity \nfor  continued  passenger  traffic  growth  and  improved  service  and  safety. 16  The  economic \nbenefits are derived from the air traffic that will be generated. Economic benefits will include an \nincrease in tourist spending derived from longer stay in the regions and additional tourist arrivals \nto  the  country  with  better  accessibility  to  more  parts  of  the  country,  aeronautical  revenues \nreceived by the airport from new traffic, and improved aircraft utilization by the airline operator. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  investment  is  estimated  at  18.7%.  A \nsensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes \nin  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits.  The  analysis  indicates \nthat  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  would  remain  satisfactory  even  under  adverse  scenarios, \nand  that  a cost  increase  of  53%  or  decrease in benefits  of  30%  would be  required to reach a \ncut-off economic internal rate of return of 12%. \n \n21. \nThe  financial  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  project \ninvestment based on revenues from the domestic airport improvements to cover the capital and \noperating  costs.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  2.9%. 17 Based  on  the \nfinancial  projections  and  evaluation,  the  project  is  financially  sustainable  and  will  generate \nsufficient  revenue  to  meet  the  operation  and  maintenance  expenditure  and  will  recover  the \ninvestment  made.  However,  the  rate  of  return  on  investment  will  not  be  significant.  The \neconomic analysis demonstrates the social and economic benefits from improved accessibility, \nincluding  substantial  tourism  growth  potential  and  local  employment  generation.  Thus,  overall \nthe project is considered viable.18 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nPolicy, legal, and institutional capacity. DCA, established in 1986 and currently under \nthe  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communications  (MOIC),  will  be  the  executing  agency \nresponsible  for  administration  of  civil  aviation  and  all  matters  concerning  regulation  and \noperation of the country\u2019s airports and airfields. The DCA director general reports to the MOIC \nsecretary. Based on the sector assessment carried out under ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA, a \ncapacity development TA (footnote 9) is under way to strengthen the regulatory and operating \nperformance of air transport, including (i) preparing updates for the Civil Aviation Act 2000 and \napplicable Bhutan air navigation regulations to reflect current needs; (ii) formulating a framework \nfor  restructuring  DCA  and  drafting  necessary  legislation  to  enable  effective  separation  of  the \nregulatory  and  operating  functions;  and  (iii)  providing  technical  training  in  the  critical  areas  of \nregulatory  oversight  and  airport  operations.  While  DCA  does  not  have  experience  with  ADB-\nfinanced projects, it has undertaken infrastructure improvements funded by government sources \nand successfully implemented improvements funded by other bilateral development partners. \n \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 1997.

An  assessment  was  carried  of  DCA\u2019s  accounting  system, \n23. \nfinancial  reporting,  and  external  audit  procedures  (footnote  2).  DCA,  a  government  agency, \nfollows  the  accounting  and  reporting  process  detailed  in  the  Finance  and  Accounting  Manual \ndeveloped  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  Based  on  this,  DCA  maintains  its  accounts  on  a  cash \nbasis and utilizes the government\u2019s standardized budget and accounting system, computerized \nsince 2003, which produces satisfactory financial reports and ensures availability of data. DCA\u2019s \nproject implementation unit for the project will  include a suitably qualified accountant. DCA will \nmaintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received and \nexpenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. The Royal Audit Authority of \nBhutan, an independent and nonpartisan institution authorized to perform audits on government \nagencies,  will  annually  audit  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance \nwith international  auditing  standards.19 To minimize risks,  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure will \nbe  used  for  a  substantial  portion  of  the  disbursements  for  works,  goods,  and  consulting \nservices. \n \n24. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Under  the  government\u2019s  Procurement  Rules  and \nRegulations (2009), the Public Procurement Policy Division under the Ministry of Finance is the \noversight agency for public procurement in the country and is mandated, among other things, to \nmake  recommendations  to  the  government  for  reform  of  the  procurement  policy  or  laws, \nprepare  standard  biding  documents,  issue  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  on  procurement, \nliaise  with  government  organizations  to  develop  human  resources  and  professionalism  in \nprocurement,  and  act  as  the  central  counterpart  for  any  procurement-related  issues  in \nconnection  with  donors.  The  regulations  also  recognize  that  donor  rules  and  procedures  on \nprocurement may prevail in the case of donor-funded projects. The Anti-Corruption Commission \nunder  the  Anti-Corruption  Act  of  Bhutan,  enacted  in  2006,  has  authority  to  take  necessary \nactions  to  prevent  and  combat  corruption;  investigate  acts  of  corruption  whenever  there  is \nevidence of corruption; sanction corrupt firms from participating in government bids; and monitor \nimplementation  of  the  anticorruption  national  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOIC, and DCA. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  The  government\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \nidentifies  poverty  reduction  as  a  core  development  theme,  mainstreaming  the  poor  through  a \ntargeted  approach.  In  support  of  this,  the  three  domestic  airports  covered  by  the  project  are \nlocated  in  the  poorer  gewogs  and  dzongkhags  of  the  country. 20 The  primary  beneficiaries, \nbased  on  the  socioeconomic  survey  of  the  project  influence  area,  will  be  people  who  are \ngeographically disadvantaged with poor accessibility by roads.21 Improved air transport service \nwill reduce travel time and help ensure emergency services for women, the sick, and the elderly. \nIt will also help promote tourism, enhancing opportunities for local businesses and employment. \n \n26. \nGender. As the project activities are confined within the boundaries of each airport, the \nproject  will  not  directly  interface  with  nearby  communities.  However,  a  gender  analysis  was \n\n                                                \n19 Audit standards are broadly in line with those of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. \n20  Gewogs  and  dzongkhags  are  equivalent  to  village  blocks  and  districts,  respectively.  Bhutan  consists  of  205 \n\ngewogs, comprising 20 dzongkhags.   \n\n21 The  socioeconomic  survey  covered  20%  of  households  in  the  project  influence  area,  and  included  public \nconsultations  and  focus  group  discussions  to  gather  feedback  from  local  communities  on  the  proposed \ndevelopment project and perceived socioeconomic impacts. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nundertaken as part the social and economic assessment to assess possible impacts. Women in \nthe  project  influence  area  are  mainly  engaged  in  agriculture  and  home-based  income-\ngenerating  activities.  Most  are  anticipating  possible  benefits  from  employment  opportunities \nduring  construction  and business  opportunities from  tourism growth.22 Women  are  expected to \nattain  equal  benefits  from  the  project.  Provisions  in  bidding  documents  require  contractors  to \nensure  that  all  civil  works  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child  labor  for \nconstruction  or maintenance;  encourage  the  employment  of  the  poor,  particularly  women;  and \ndo not differentiate wages between men and women, particularly for work of equal value. \n \n27. \nHIV/AIDS.  The  government  has  initiated  many  HIV/AIDS-prevention  activities  in  the \ncountry, which has a very low incidence of HIV. Based on the poverty and social assessment, \nthe project does not anticipate any rise in the risk of HIV/AIDS incidence. Contractors will carry \nout  HIV/AIDS  awareness  activities  for  laborers  at  work  sites,  which  will  be  monitored  by \nsupervision consultants. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \n28. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). As the civil works and installation of \nequipment  for  the  project  will  be  undertaken  within  the  existing  boundaries  of  the  respective \nairports, no  private  land or  property  will  be  acquired.  Due  diligence  was undertaken  to  assess \nthe  status  of  compensation  paid  to  affected  people  for  land  acquired  by  DCA  for  prior  airport \ndevelopment undertaken with government funding. All the affected people have either been paid \ncash compensation or provided with land for land. \n \n29. \nImpact  on  indigenous  peoples.  No  indigenous  peoples  are  living  in the project  area. \nNo impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged as no physical or economic displacement will be \nrequired. Therefore, the project is classified as category C. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n30. \nAs the works and installation of equipment for the project will be improvements within the \nboundaries  of  existing  airport  facilities  already  developed  by  the  government,  the  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts are low. Therefore, the project is classified as category B. In accordance \nwith ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, necessary due diligence of the environmental impacts \nfor  existing  facilities  previously  developed  by  the  government  was  carried  out.  In  this  respect, \nthe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  includes  a  section  on  the  review  of  environmental \nimpacts  and  mitigation measures  taken  during construction  of the  existing facilities,  as  well  as \nrecommendations  for  continued  and  improved  actions  during  implementation  of  additional \nimprovements under the project. Anticipated environmental impacts include occupational health \nand  safety  issues,  generation  of  dust  and  noise,  and  drainage  problems.  These  can  be \naddressed  during  the  detailed  design  and  construction  phase  through  appropriate  design  and \nmitigation measures recommended in the environmental management plan (EMP). Typically for \nairport projects, the main long-term impact is the generation of noise, vibration, and air pollution \nduring operations. In addition to complying with applicable international standards, appropriate \nlandscaping and greenbelt development in each airport area is recommended to help minimize \nimpacts.  Consultations  with  communities  residing  in  and  around  the  airport  sites  were \n\n                                                \n22 Focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nIEE  report \n\nthe  consultations, \n\nincludes  details  of \n\nfeedback  received, \ncompleted.  The \nrequirements  for  further  consultation,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism.  As  required  by \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, the IEE report was disclosed. \n \nDCA  needs  to  strengthen  its  overall  institutional  capacity,  including  for  environmental \n31. \nsafeguards,  which  will  be  assessed  and  addressed  under  ADB  capacity  development  TA \nstarting  in  2012  (footnote  9).  For  the  project,  DCA\u2019s  project  director  will  serve  as  the  overall \nenvironmental safeguard coordinator. The project coordinator for each airport will serve as the \non-site  focal  point  for  environmental  safeguards.  The  design  and  supervision  consultant  team \nwill  include  an  environment  specialist  to  update  the  EMP  and  monitor  contractor  compliance. \nDuring implementation, training  and  coordination  workshops  on environmental  safeguards  and \nEMP  implementation  will  be  conducted  for  DCA,  consultants,  and  contractors.  Annual \nenvironmental  monitoring reports  will  be  prepared  and submitted  to  ADB for  disclosure on  the \nADB  website,  as  required  by  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  environment  category  B \nprojects. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment delay in releasing \ncounterpart funds \n\nLack of previous experience \nwith ADB-funded procurement \n\nImplementation delay \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB will cover 100% of total expenditure for works, goods, and services, \nexclusive of taxes and duties to be exempted by the Government of \nBhutan. This will ease the financial burden on the government to provide \ncounterpart funding and, thereby, ensure adequate cash flow during \nimplementation. \nThe design and supervision consultant team, including international and \nnational procurement specialists, will help DCA\u2019s project implementation \nunit prepare bidding documents and the bid evaluation report, and \nexecute the contracts. \nAdvance action is being taken with the objective of awarding the \nconsulting services contract shortly following grant effectiveness to \nensure timely commencement of engineering design and preparation of \nbidding documents. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government and MOIC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\n33. \nThe government  and  MOIC  have assured  ADB that  implementation  of the  project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n34. \nwhich will be set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n \n \n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  $6,920,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for  the \nAir Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n29 May 2012 \n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n\fDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nImproved air \ntransport \nconnectivity \n\nOutcome \nImproved safety, \nsecurity, and \ncapacity at three \ndomestic airports \nin Bumthang, \nGelephu, and \nYonphula \n\nOutputs \nImproved \ninfrastructure at \nthree domestic \nairports in \nBumthang, \nGelephu, and \nYonphula \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators \nwith Baselines \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nNumber of air passengers per annum \nincreases to 431,300 international and \n59,900 domestic by 2020 (2010 \nbaseline: 127,181 international and nil \ndomestic) \n\nMonitoring report of the \nDepartment of Civil \nAviation \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisk \nAir traffic \nvolume is \nadversely \naffected by the \nglobal \neconomy. \n\nAssumption \nThe \ngovernment \nprovides \nadequate funds \nfor operation \nand \nmaintenance \nexpenses on \ntime. \n\n(For all indicators) \nAnnual audit and \ninspection report of the \nDepartment of Civil \nAviation \n\n(For all indicators) \nMonitoring report of the \nDepartment of Civil \nAviation \n\nAssumption \nCivil works and \nequipment \ninstallation \nprogress on \nschedule \n\nCompletion by 2016: \nSafety standards improved to meet \nICAO requirements for air craft \nparking, aeronautical communication, \nand air rescue and fire fighting service \nsupport facilities \n \nSecurity standards improved to meet \nICAO requirements for security cordon \naround perimeter \n \nCapacity for level of service in terminal \nareas improved from IATA standard \ngrade E to B \n\nCompletion by 2016:  \n1.
