The project will help \nintegrate MCH services at the primary and secondary levels to deliver better quality of healthcare \nin three districts with the highest rates of maternal and child mortality.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nTajikistan is a small, landlocked country located in the southeastern region of Central Asia. \nIts  territory  covers  142,600  square  kilometers  and  is  bordered  by  Uzbekistan  and  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic to the west and north, the People\u2019s Republic of China to the east, and Afghanistan to \nthe south. It is a low-middle income country with a gross national income per capita of $1,110; a \npopulation of 8.7 million; and a poverty headcount rate of 31.3%.2 \n \nTajikistan is committed to the attainment of SDG3 targets for neonatal and infant mortality \n4. \n\u2013\u201312  neonatal  and  25  infant  deaths  per  1,000  live  births.  The  country\u2019s  current  child  mortality \nrates are 20 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births and 37 infant mortality rate.3 Maternal mortality \nalso  is  higher  in  Tajikistan\u2013\u201332  deaths  per  100,000  live  births  in  2017\u2013\u2013than  in  other  Central \nAsian or European countries, which averaged 23 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017.4  \n \n5. \nThe attainment of the MCH-related SDG3 targets is constrained by systemic health sector \nissues  such  as  inadequate  funding for  and  delivery  of  quality  health  care  services,  insufficient \nhuman  resources,  and  the  population\u2019s  limited  awareness  of  the  importance  of  MCH.  Other \nimpediments  to  MCH  outcomes  outside  the  health  sector  are  poverty,  geography,  and  lack  of \naccess to clean water. \n  \nAchieving better health for all is an important part of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \n6. \nStrategy 2030 which aims to address remaining poverty and reducing inequalities in Asia and the \nPacific. The strategy regards ADB\u2019s support for improving quality and coverage of health services \nand  reducing  the  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the  poor  as  essential  in  addressing \nimpoverishment.  \n \n7. \nHealth services delivery. MCH care suffers from fragmented links and communication \nbetween primary health care (PHC) and hospital care, nonfunctioning referral pathways, and an \nabsence of patient follow-up practices. Apart from being fragmented, the service delivery system \nis duplicative. For instance, antenatal care, immunization, and child health care are provided at \n\n                                                \n1 To select the districts, Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan and ADB \ndeveloped a three-step process that included ranking of district using indicators depicting MCH continuum of care \nand  socio-economic  status,  exclusion  of    districts  with  significant  donor  presence,  and  identifying  readiness  for \nreforms through  focus group discussions and surveys.

Monitoring the situation of Women and Children, and World Bank. World Development Indicators.  \n \n\n\fPHC centers. Alongside these are specialized institutions such as the Center for Immunization \nand  the  Center  for  Integrated  Management  of  Childhood  Illnesses,  which  can  also  provide \nconsultations on MCH. These specialized centers are vertical programs that directly report to the \nMinistry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan (MOHSPP). \nSome of them also provide limited inpatient care. \n \n8. \nMost patients go directly to secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals, bypassing most rural \nhospitals for child delivery and during child illness. Bypassing leads to disrupted patient care and \na  more  expensive  health  service  delivery.  Although  regulations  on  a  referral  system  exist,  its \nimplementation is not enforced. \n  \n9. \nHealth facilities in remote districts  are in poor condition after years of underinvestment, \nand available technology and equipment are often obsolete. About 65% of the facilities were built \nbetween 1938 and 1990, and most do not meet basic technical requirements and put both patients \nand  staff  at  risk.5 Some  lack  electricity  during  winter,  many  have  inadequate  sanitation,  and \ninfection-preventing measures are not always adhered to.6 \n \n10. \nHuman resources for health. The poor qualifications of health care workers are another \nconstraint. In a small-scale study of selected health care providers in rural areas, physicians and \nmidwives on average answered less than 50% of 52 knowledge questions about maternity care \ncorrectly. 7  Continuous  medical  education  (CME)  is  regulated  by  a  special  decree.  Publicly \nfinanced slots are scarce, and neither the health facilities nor the physicians can afford to pay for \ntraining. Demand for paid CME courses is low unless they are financed by development partners.8 \nThe quality of care has also suffered from a serious brain drain, beginning with the civil war and \ncontinuing into the present, as health workers seek higher wages abroad. \n \n11. \nHealth financing. All the problems above are exacerbated by limited financing for health. \nDespite the political commitment to public health,9 the health sector commands only 7.0% of the \ntotal  government  budget,  compared  with  12.0%  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  an  11.5%  global \nweighted average.10 Consequently, households\u2019 shoulder most of the health care costs.11 \n \n12. \nA World Bank review of public health expenditure noted an oversupply of beds and too \nmany  avoidable  inpatient  admissions  (an  estimated  one-third  of  these  cases  could  have  been \ntreated  in  outpatient  settings).12 This  situation  is  compounded  by  the  current  health  financing \nmodalities, whereby the government provides funds through line-item budgeting, which allocates \npublic funds to institutions based on their bed capacity, number of staff, and historical utility costs. \n\n                                                \n5  KfW. 2013.

World Development Indicators. \n11 Data from the 2015 Tajikistan health accounts show that 63.3% of total health expenditures are met by households\u2019 \n\nout-of-pocket payments. \n\n12 World Bank. 2013. Tajikistan Public Expenditure Review. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fIn  contrast,  many  countries  have  shifted  to  a  case-based  payment  system,  which  reimburses \nhospitals at a predetermined fixed rate for each treated case.13 \n \n13. \nKnowledge of maternal and child health. The share of pregnant women delivering in \nhospitals has steadily increased in Tajikistan\u2019s urban centers, but in rural and often remote areas, \nawareness  of  the  need  for  timely  and  good-quality  MCH  care  remains  low.  Limited  access  to \nhospitals and cultural issues are only part of the story. The rural population also lacks important \ninformation  on  childcare  practices.  A  coherent  and  culturally  sensitive  strategy  to  change  the \nhealth-seeking behavior of  rural families does  not  exist,  and  rural  health workers  also  lack  the \nskills to communicate effectively with these communities.  \n \n14. \nGovernment\u2019s sector strategies. The pursuit of SDG3 is echoed in the National Health \nStrategy for Tajikistan, 2010\u20132020, which envisions strengthening maternal, newborn, child, and \nadolescent  health;  preventing  and  controlling  infectious  diseases;  decreasing  the  burden  of \npreventable  noncommunicable  diseases;  and  improving  PHC.  The  government  approved  the \nStrategic Plan for the Rationalization of Medical Facilities in the Republic of Tajikistan for 2010\u2013\n2020 (No. 169 dated 1 April 2011) to rationalize health service delivery. The plan envisions the \nintegration of health services across levels of care and types of providers. \n \n15. \nLessons.  The project will build upon achievements and lessons learned from ADB\u2019s past \nsupport  to  health  sector  in  Tajikistan.  A  major  lesson  learned  from  the  Health  Sector  Reform \nProject is that rationalization of health facilities and provision of adequate health financing should \ngo hand in hand.14 The completion report noted the value of conducting comprehensive needs \nassessment before drawing up civil works and equipment lists to ensure right inputs are made, \nand the need for intensive information campaigns to ensure community participation. \n \n16. \nADB value addition. ADB will contribute to the integration of primary and secondary care \nby concentrating on MCH, which is key for better-quality and efficient provision of services. The \nproject  will  consolidate  different  pilots  of  development  partners  that  focus  on  either  PHC  or \nsecondary care into an integrated concept. Integrated care refers to integration and coordination \nof  all  levels  of  health  services  (primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary)  to  provide  patients  with  more \neffective  and  continuous  care.15 ADB  will  bring  in  regional  lessons  on  integrating  health  care \nservices  and  improving  efficiencies  in  health  service  delivery  to  inform  the  project  and  the \ncountry\u2019s ongoing health reforms.  \n \n17. \nDevelopment  partner  support.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  has \nbeen  supporting  the  rationalization  of  hospitals  in  Khatlon  Oblast  since  2011,  while  the  World \nBank,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  German  development  cooperation \nthrough Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) have been supporting \nPHC.  United  Nations  agencies  such  as  the  World  Health  Organization,  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations \nPopulation  Fund  are  also  providing  policy  and  implementation  support  to  the  sector.  KfW\u2019s \nplanned financing of the Mother, Child and Emergency Care VI program will align with the project \nto complete the continuum of MCH care: the ADB project focuses on primary and secondary care, \n\n                                                \n13 J.

Preliminary design reflects \nenvironmentally sound heating and cooling solutions, as well as cost-effective waste treatment \nprocesses.  Outputs 1 and 3 will ensure sustainability of the project through (i)  training of health \nworkers through on-the-job training; (ii) establishment of a CME institute for health workers with \nMOHSPP;  (iii)    building  the  capacity  of  central,  regional,  and  district  health  and  financial \nadministrations;  (iv)    re-introduction  of  equipment  maintenance  specialist  at  district  hospitals \nwithin  the  project  area  and  ensure  staffing;  and  (v)  inclusion  of  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenditures in annual facility budgets. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n26. \nEconomic analysis.  An economic analysis was conducted by ADB staff in accordance \nwith relevant ADB guidelines.23 Two main streams of project benefits are quantifiable. First, the \nproject will lead to cost savings in MCH care for vulnerable households. Second, the project will \nlead to higher productivity of beneficiaries by helping reduce morbidity and mortality. The resulting \nbase-case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  9.1%,  indicating  that  the  program  is \neconomically viable because its value is above the opportunity cost of investment for social sector \nprojects of 6% (footnote 23). A sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR is sensitive to changes \nin costs and benefits. All the scenarios yield EIRR rates above the 6% return on investment for \nsocial sector projects. \n \nFinancial analysis.  ADB staff undertook a fiscal impact and sustainability analysis on the \n27. \ngovernment\u2019s  ability  to  cover  provision  of  counterpart funds,  recurrent  and maintenance  costs. \nThe analysis confirms that the government has adequate financial resources and will be able to \nfulfill all its financial obligations under the project. The tax exemption cost is significantly less than \n1% of the government\u2019s total annual expenditure and total health expenditure.  \n \nC. \n \nFinancial management.  An  assessment of the financial management arrangements for \n28. \nthe project concluded that the risk rating is substantial for the following reasons:  (i) insufficient \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  (ii)  a  partially \nautomated payment system, (iii) weak internal audit capacity,(iv) lack of an integrated financial \nmanagement information system; (v) no external audits, and (vi) lack of experience with ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management requirements and disbursement procedures. The risk will be mitigated with \nan  action  plan  that  includes:  (i)  conducting  regular  training  for  project  staff  on  financial \nmanagement and providing consultant support to PAG; (ii) developing a financial manual that will \nalso define internal control measures such as segregation of duties, authorizations, obligations, \nand  reconciliations;  (iii)  providing  technical  support  to  create  an  internal  audit  manual  and \nmethodology,  as  well  as  an  internal  audit  charter  to  guide  PAG  activities;  (iv)  having  project \nfinancial statements audited by independent auditors based on terms of reference agreed with \nthe ADB; (v) installing of a fully automated accounting system that will generate interim financial \nreports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  regularly  and  on  time;  and  (vi)  adopting  a  project  accounting \nsystem to ensure quality and reliable accounting and reporting. \n \nProcurement.    An  assessment  of  the  procurement  arrangements  concluded  that  the \n29. \nprocurement risk is substantial because of limited capacity for following ADB procedures. The risk \nwill  be  mitigated  by  hiring  experienced  procurement  specialists  for  the  PAG.  All  procurement \n(including consulting services and advance actions) will be undertaken in full conformity with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) as indicated in the PAM (footnote 21). The \nprocurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least  annually,  and  proposed  changes  will  require  ADB \napproval.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  oversight  and  monitoring,  including  posting  the  initial \nprocurement  plan  and  any  subsequent  changes.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  through  open \ncompetitive bidding. \n \n30. \nExecuting/implementing  agency  has  been  recommended  to  consider  direct  contracting \nwith UNICEF related to some activities in Output 1 and 3, subject to ADB review.  UNICEF has \n\n                                                \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nrich experience in maternal and child health and behavior change communication in Tajikistan \nand most of the output activities in continuous quality improvement, supportive supervision, and \nbehavior  change  communication  strategy  are  continuation  of  previous  work  done  by \nUNICEF.24   The choice of UNICEF allows for an expeditious contracting and commencement of \nimplementation  of  soft  components  of  the  project  and  there  are  financial  advantages  due  to \nmultiplier effect of investments.  \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MOHSPP. The policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe project addresses key poverty and social issues by bringing improved and accessible \nhealth  services  closer  to  patients.  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  the  rural \npopulation,  especially,  women  of  reproductive  age,  pregnant  women,  and  children  who  are \nfrequent users of health services. The project will also benefit health workers across the entire \nhealth  system,  but  most  particularly  those  working  on  MCH  services  in  hospitals  or  at  PHC \nfacilities  in  project  districts.  The  project  will  assist  the  poor  and  vulnerable  by  better  preparing \nclinical staff to diagnose, treat, counsel, and adhere to MCH referral protocols, and thus better \nrespond to the health concerns of the community. The project will also involve the community in \nBCC  activities  by  engaging  with  community  leaders,  religious  leaders,  and  representatives  of \nwomen\u2019s committees to raise people\u2019s awareness of MCH and other health issues and improve \naccess to quality health care services. TRTA prepared a poverty reduction and social strategy \nthat includes measures to manage social impacts and enhance the distribution of benefits from \nthe project. \n \n33. \nGender. The project is classified as gender equity because it directly tackles the problem \nof poor access to MCH health services. Specifically, it targets a significant increase in the number \nof  women and children who  seek  health care services,  and the timely  and quality  provision  of \nantenatal,  delivery,  postnatal,  and  well-child  care  and  services.  It  will  build  or  rehabilitate \nobstetrics  and  gynecological  units  in  the  district  hospitals  and  equip  them  with  the  necessary \nmedical equipment, as well as women- and child-friendly facilities such as private examination \nrooms,  sex-segregated  toilets,  and  diaper-changing  rooms.  The  project  will  also  help  develop \ngender-sensitive referral protocols and ensure continuous training of professional MCH staff such \nas family doctors, nurses, and midwives. Finally, the project will address the sociocultural attitudes \nthat keep the population from seeking timely MCH services by launching a BCC campaign that \ntargets women of reproductive age, husbands, and mothers-in-law, as well as middle and high \nschool  students.  The  project  has  a  gender  action  plan  that  outlines  the  gender  equality \ninterventions that will improve women\u2019s access to quality health services. \n \nE. \n \n34. \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n35. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  B  for  environment  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  2009  (SPS  2009).  In  accordance  with  SPS  2009  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  report,  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP), \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n24 Paragraph 2.17, provision of ADB Procurement Strategy (2017, as amended from time to time). \n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fhas been prepared, covering all facilities to be rehabilitated under this project. Potential negative \nenvironmental  impacts  are  largely  related  to  construction  activities  under  output  2.  The  main \nidentified impacts during construction or reconstruction are dust, solid waste, and occupational \nand community health risks, such as those arising from removal, handling, and disposal of old \nasbestos  sheeting.  Dust  and/or  solid  waste  impacts  will  also  arise  from  small-scale  outdoor \nconstruction activities\u2014such as building septic tanks and repairing water supply and canalization \nsystems\u2014and  when  replacing  old  equipment.  Impacts  during  operation are expected from  the \nstorage  and  disposal  of medical  waste.  The  EMP  defines  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements and will be included as an appendix in all bidding and contract documents. A site-\nspecific EMP will be prepared by the contractor before construction and approved by the PAG. \nThe institutional capacity of the borrower to manage environmental risks and operational tasks in \nconnection  with  health  care  waste  is  limited.  To  raise  awareness  and  develop  the  capacity  of \nMOHSPP,  hospitals,  health  centers,  and  district  administrations,  project  activities  to  build \nenvironmental  management  capacity  will  include  training  programs  at  hospitals  and  health \ncenters that specifically deal with hospital and domestic waste management. The IEE provides \nguidance for contractors on preparing a waste management plan. The cost for implementing the \nEMP will be borne by the project, while the costs of mitigating measures will be included in the \nconstruction contracts, and the cost for environmental monitoring and training of the PAG will be \nincluded  in  the  consulting  services  of  the  construction  supervision  consultants.  A  full-time \nenvironment specialist in the PAG will oversee and monitor the implementation of the EMP and \nsite-specific plans. \n \n36. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Social safeguards due diligence confirmed that \nthe  project  activities  will  neither  require  land  acquisition  nor  resettlement.  Construction  or \nrehabilitation of district hospitals and DHCs will take place within the existing land. If any changes \nor  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  identified  during  the \nproject implementation stage, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with the ADB \nSPS  (2009)  and  national  requirements.  The  resettlement  plan  needs  to  be  fully  implemented \nbefore any works start at the impact sites. A resettlement framework is not required as under the \ninvoluntary resettlement category C. \n \n37. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  No  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, live in the project area, so the project is classified as category C for \nindigenous peoples impacts. \n \n38. \nPublic disclosure. The IEE and EMP will be endorsed and disclosed publicly once the \ngovernment  has  endorsed  the  project  and  before  approval  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors.  \nInformation  about  the  project  including  general  project  information,  contact  details,  project \nprogress, procurement, and audited financial statements of the project, will be publicly disclosed.  \n \nF. \n \n39. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nAssumptions and proposed actions of the \nmasterplan for the development of MCH services \nin the project districts will not be implemented \nFrequent turnover of trained staff \n\nDelays  in  setting-up  the  PAG  and  launching \ntenders for consulting services may delay project \nimplementation. \nLimited \nmanagement capacity \n\nprocurement \n\nfinancial \n\nand \n\nrisk \n\nFinancial  resources  will  not  be  sufficient  to \nmaintain  improved  conditions  (infrastructure  and \nequipment, qualified staff) for medical services in \nthe target hospitals \n\nMitigation Measures \nTri-partite agreement between MOHSPP, MOF and \nlocal governments on masterplan adoption will be \nsigned as part of project covenants. \nIntensify supportive supervision to fill the knowledge \ngap  through  on-the-job-training  and  mentoring  to \nnew staff. \nMOHSPP has started taking steps to establish the \nPAG; preparation for consultant engagement will be \nsupported by TA.  \nThe PAG will be established to support MOHSPP in \nfinancial  and  procurement  management.
