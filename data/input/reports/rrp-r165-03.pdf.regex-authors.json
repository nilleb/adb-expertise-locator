An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the environmental review procedure for screening \nand approving subprojects is in Appendix 13. The summary IEE of a \nsample project is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n   \nProject Description  The Project, developed as a sector loan under the framework of the \nGovernment of Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction focus in the 10th National \nDevelopment  Plan,  will  provide  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(RWSS)  facilities  and  services  to  improve  community  health  and \nprovide  opportunities  for  income  generation  (Kingdom  of  Nepal \nNovember 2002. Tenth Plan (1998/99-2001/2002), Drinking Water \nand Sanitation Section) to about 1,200 communities in 21 districts. It \nwill also facilitate building the capacity of local authority institutions \n(district  development  committees  (DDCs),  village  development \ncommittee  (VDCs)),  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \ndecentralized  decision  making  by  focusing  implementation  at  the \ndistrict level. With its strong community-based approach, the Project \nwill help rectify historical inequities in RWSS service provision to \nremote districts (Midwestern and Far Western development regions), \nand  will  focus  on  providing  service  to  previously  underserved \ncommunities and families in those communities whose access to \nRWSS was limited due to gender, caste, or ethnicity.  \n \nRationale  Nepal has less than 0.4% of the world\u2019s population, but possesses \n2.3% of the world\u2019s water resources. Despite the abundant water \nresources, however, the country\u2019s harsh terrain makes access to \nwater  supply  difficult  for  many  segments  of  the  population.  The \nGovernment  estimates  water  supply  coverage  to  be  around  70% \nnationwide, but the quality of coverage data is highly variable and \ndoes not necessarily imply that the systems are working. Access in \nrural areas is substantially lower. Many rely on shallow wells, ponds, \nand  streams,  which  are  often  both  biologically  and  chemically \ncontaminated. The burdens associated with shortage of water are \nborne disproportionately by women and children. \n \n  Lack of water impacts on the lowest income groups, especially on \nwomen and children who spend as much as 4-5 hours a day fetching \nwater from distant sources. This task causes the women to lose out \non  productive  opportunities  while  children  forgo  educational \nopportunities. These groups also suffer significantly from waterborne \ndiseases due to use of water unfit for human consumption and from \nthe high cost of health care due to illness. The provision of safe water \nwill enable these beneficiaries to make more productive use of their \ntime and will yield significant health benefits. \n   ", "iv   \n \nSection  III  of  the  2001  Millennium  Development  Goals  includes \nhalving, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or \ncannot afford safe drinking water. The goals also identify increased \ninvestment in the water and sanitation sectors, as one of the main \nstrategies.  In  its  10th National Development Plan and its poverty  \nreduction  strategy,  the    Government    emphasizes  the  need  to  \nimprove  water supply, sanitation,  and community health services. It \naims to increase sector coverage efficiently and equitably as a means \nof reducing poverty and accelerating broad-based economic growth \nto meet the needs of the poor and disadvantaged groups. It identifies \naccess to safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation as one of its \npriorities in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.  \n   \nObjectives   The overall objective is to expand the coverage of improved water \nsupply and sanitation facilities to underserved populations, especially \nto  poor  and  remote  areas,  and  to  improve  health  and  hygiene \npractices related to waterborne and sanitation diseases. The Project \nwill (i) strengthen participating communities\u2019 capacity and capability to \nplan, cofinance, implement, manage, operate, and maintain improved \nwater supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) increase the participation of \ncastes, ethnic minorities, and women; (iii) increase hygiene education \nthrough  awareness  campaigns;  (iv)  develop  the  capacity  and \ncapability of a wide range of sectoral support organizations, such as \nnongovernment  organizations/community-based  organizations,  to \nprovide efficient and cost-effective support to communities and local \nauthorities so as to improve RWSS service delivery; (v) support the \nimplementation of the National Water Supply Sector Policy 1998 and \nthe Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action \nPlan;  and  (vi)  support  and  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  efforts  by  focusing  project  activities  and  decision \nmaking at the local authorities and community levels. \n   \nThe project has two components. The RWSS component includes \ncommunity  mobilization  and  capacity  building  for  sustainability; \nconstruction  of  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  services; \nhealth and hygiene program; and gender, caste and ethnic minority \nprogram.  The  institutional  strengthening  component  will  seek  to \nstrengthen the DDCs to provide water supply and sanitation services, \nand support the decentralization policy and the Department of Water \nSupply and Sewerage (DWSS). \n \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $35.7 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange of $12.1 million (34%) and local currency equivalent \nof $23.6 million (66%).  \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost   \n  Asian Development Bank  12.1  11.9  24.0  67 \n  Government  0.0  7.7  7.7  22 \n  Local authorities (DDC and VDC)  0.0  0.4  0.4  1 \n  Beneficiaries  0.0  3.6  3.6  10 \n  Total  12.1  23.6  35.7  100 \n  DDC = district development committee, VDC = village development committee. ", "  v\nLoan Amounts and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to $24 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nan interest rate charge of 1% per annum during the grace  period and \n  1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the Loan Agreement. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation  A project management unit will be established in Kathmandu. To \nArrangements  head the unit, the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) \nwill appoint a project director (class I officer with sector experience) \nwho will provide management and policy support to the district-based \nwater and sanitation support teams (WSSTs) and will facilitate a \ndetailed  strategy  and  the  implementation  of  the  institutional \nstrengthening component. WSSTs will be established within the DDC \nin  each  of  the  selected  districts  to  support  the  communities  in \nimplementing RWSS schemes and to ensure that the social programs \nare integrated in planning and implementation. WSST together with \nthe DDC will provide technical support for the RWSS component. A \nparticipatory approach will be adopted to formulate and design the \nRWSS  schemes,  and  the  communities  will  have  the  main \nresponsibility for scheme identification, design, and implementation. \n \nExecuting Agency  MPPW  is  the  Executing  Agency,  with  responsibility  delegated  to \nDWSS. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  \nEquipment packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less will be \nprocured following international shopping procedures acceptable to \nADB and packages valued at $50,000 equivalent or less will be under \ndirect  purchasing  procedures.  There  will  be  no  procurement  by \ninternational competitive bidding. Civil works contracts for the rural \ncomponent will be small, with an average value of $10,000\u201315,000 \nequivalent and will follow community participation in procurement in \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 1,217 person-months of consulting services \n(15  person-months  international,  and  1,202  of  domestic)  for \ninstitutional  reform,  finance  and  accounting,  social  development, \ncommunity development, and project management. One consulting \nfirm  will  provide  consulting  services  to  the  PMU.  For  the  rural \ncomponent, 10 consulting contracts (2 contracts per batch of districts) \nwill  provide  consulting  services  to  the  WSSTs.  Consultants  and \nnongovernment  organizations/private  sector  organizations  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging of domestic \nconsultants. \n   ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits of the Project will be (i) improved health and \nBeneficiaries  nutrition; (ii) less resources (time and cash) spent by households to \nobtain water, especially by women and young girls; and (iii) improved \nconditions for women, and socially excluded castes and groups. By \nreducing child mortality and malnutrition due to waterborne diseases, \nand  increasing  environmental  sustainability  due  to  reduction  of \ngroundwater extraction and elimination of unsafe sanitation practices, \nthe Project directly addresses both ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s goal \nof  poverty  reduction  and  contributes  to  the  achievement  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s millennium goals. \n \nOther  benefits  include  improved  school  attendance  due  to  better \nhealth  and  reduced  water  carrying  burdens,  especially  for  girls; \nsupport for decentralization efforts; improved sectoral management \nand increased sector capacity; and improved health of the general \npopulation and reduced mortality. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  improved  WSS  facilities  and  associated \nhealth services to about 1,200 rural communities in the Midwestern \nand Far Western development regions. About 850,000 people will \nbenefit from safe drinking water. The Project focuses on poor areas \nwhere conflict has heightened poverty. The project efforts will focus \nmore  on  addressing  the  needs  of  the  historically  underserved \ncommunities in previously conflict-affected areas. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project assumes (i) a stable political environment and economic \nstability in Nepal; (ii) continuing Government support to the Project, in \nthe form of available funds, support to the decentralization process, \nand implementation of the RWSS sector strategy and action plan; and \n(iii) DWSS acting as a facilitator of RWSS.  \n \nIt is assumed that the rural communities will demand improvement of \nwater infrastructure in their communities and will be willing and able \nto contribute 20% of the capital investment and to take over the \noperation and maintenance of the schemes. \n \nA lack of progress in the peace process is also a significant risk as it \nmay  impede  the  implementation  of  the  rural  component  due  to \nsecurity and safety concerns in some districts and because local \nelections are not likely to be held unless the peace negotiations take \nplace. Project activities could continue, albeit more slowly, if the \ncurrent cease-fire does not hold. \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In  its  10th  National  Development  Plan  and  its  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  the \nGovernment emphasizes the need to improve water supply, sanitation, and community health \nservices in Nepal, and increase coverage efficiently and equitably to accelerate broad-based \neconomic growth to meet the needs of the poor and disadvantaged groups. The Government \nidentifies access to safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation as one of its priorities in the \nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework. Section III of the 2001 Millennium Development Goals \n(MDG) includes halving, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or cannot \nafford safe drinking water. The MDG also identifies increased investment in the water and \nsanitation sectors, as one of their main strategies.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \nstrategy for the social sectors emphasizes the development of adequate infrastructure and \nservices in rural areas.2 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.   Nepal has less than 0.4% of the world\u2019s population, but possesses 2.3% of the world\u2019s \nwater resources. Despite the abundant of water resources, however, the country\u2019s harsh terrain \nmakes access to water supply difficult for many segments of the population. The Government \nestimates water supply coverage to be around 70% nationwide, but the quality of the coverage \ndata is highly variable and does not necessarily imply that the systems are working. Access in \nrural areas is substantially lower. Many rely on shallow wells, ponds, and streams, which are \noften both biologically and chemically contaminated. The burdens associated with shortage of \nwater are borne disproportionately by women and children. Especially in the mountainous \ndistricts, women and female children can spend as much as 4-5 hours a day fetching water from \ndistant sources.  \n \n4.  The problems associated with limited access to sanitation and low levels of hygiene \nawareness are extensive and, again are borne disproportionately by women and children. The \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports that diarrhea accounts for up to 25% \nof all childhood deaths in the country. In terms of national morbidity patterns, ailments related to \ninadequate water and sanitation account for almost 72% of all ailments reported.3 Sanitation \ncoverage in 1997 was 61% in urban areas and only 17.5% in rural areas. \n  \n5.  Currently, donors are increasing their financial support for improved rural water supply \nand sanitation (RWSS) services. To help focus these efforts, representatives of nearly all \nproviders of RWSS services participated in a consensus building process to develop a broad \n                                                 \n1  United Nations 2001. Road Map Toward the Implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. Report \nof the Secretary-General. \n2  In 2000, the Government of Nepal requested ADB assistance to prepare a community-based water supply and \nsanitation project. In March 2002, technical assistance (TA3844-NEP: Community Based Water Supply and \nSanitation Project) for $750,000 was approved. \n3 Skin disease, 29.8%; worm infestation,n 14.9%; diarrhea, 12.6%; dysentery, 7.6%; gastritis, 7%.

The purpose of the sector strategy is to formulate \na  common  institutional,  financial,  community-based  approach  for  planning  and  delivering \nimproved RWSS services. The strategy reflects Government policies related to decentralized \nservice  provision  and  financial  control,  evolving  responsibilities  of  line  agencies  and  local \nauthorities, and acceptance  of the importance of full community participation in subproject \nplanning and implementation. The sector strategy confirms the importance of strong community \nparticipation  for  sustainability,  and  supports  the  need  to  integrate  community  demand  for \nimproved  services,  willingness  to  pay,  and  affordability  in  project  planning,  financing  and \nimplementation. \n   \n6.  A major institutional decentralization effort is under way across all sectors. The Local \nSelf-Governance Act (LSGA) of 1999 mandates decentralization from central to local levels and \noutlines the roles of the local authorities at district and village levels. The LSGA is clear that \ndistrict and village authorities will be taking increasing responsibility for planning and providing \nrural infrastructure (including those associated with water). Two district-level UNDP-supported \nprograms - the Local Governance Program and the Participatory District Development Program \n- are being implemented. Both intend to establish an enabling environment to implement key \nLSGA provisions. They will be integrated in the Local Governance Strengthening Program, \nsupported by the Department for International Development (DFID), UNDP, Norway, the Danish \nInternational Development Assistance, the Netherlands International Development Cooperation \nAgencies, and possibly the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr technische Zusammenarbeit. District development \nplanning activities, ongoing for several years, have resulted in district periodic plans for most \ndistricts. The LSGA requires that line ministry departments such as the Department of Water \nSupply and Sewerage (DWSS) no longer implement subprojects at the district or village levels \nas they had in the past. Sectoral implementation responsibilities will change even further as \nmajor donor organizations follow best practice, lead by nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nthe Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (Fund Board), and bilateral \ndonors  in  actively  supporting  demand-driven,  community-based  project  planning  and \nimplementation. \n \n7.  Compounding all the usual challenges of sectoral development is the considerable \npolitical uncertainty in Nepal. Major transitions within the last 2 years have greatly complicated \nnot only sectoral planning, but also virtually all other activities. Local elections were not held in \ntime and the terms of elected local authorities officials expired in mid-July 2002. National \nelections  scheduled  for  November  2002  were  cancelled.  As  a  result,  there  is  no  citizen \nrepresentation at any level of Government. This has specific impacts at the district level and \nbelow, where water supply and sanitation (WSS) sectoral development activities are focused.  \nThe Government\u2019s nascent decentralization efforts have yet to be firmly institutionalized, and \nthere are clear conflicts among line ministries themselves as to how and when transfer of \nresponsibilities  and  associated  budgets  will  effectively  take  place.  Full  support  for  the \ndecentralization efforts will dramatically improve services of WSS facilities to those who so \ndesperately need them. Political stability, elections, and implementation of the terms of the \nLSGA would provide the framework for dramatic improvement of RWSS service delivery. A \ndetailed discussion of the policy environment and ongoing sector reforms is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  In spite of considerable RWSS investment, both water and sanitation coverage remain \nwell below targeted levels. Awareness of the importance of hygiene and sanitation behavioral \nchange is limited in many communities. At the core of the slow progress in the sector are limited \nresources, and lack of accountability and collaboration with stakeholders. About 5-7% of Nepal\u2019s ", "3 \ndevelopment budget is allocated to the water and sanitation  sector. Of this, two thirds is \nfinanced by external sources, including ADB. Unfortunately, coordination and dialogue among \nassistance agencies are inadequate and result in significant overlaps in target areas and \ninefficient  mobilization  of  available  resources.  Other  significant  problems  are  lack  of \ntransparency and comprehensive information in the sector; inadequate community participation \nduring implementation of water supply projects; continued exclusion of women, castes and \nethnic  minorities  from  community  decision  making;  inefficient  mobilization  of  NGOs;  weak \nprivate sector activity in rural areas; inadequate health and hygiene education programs; and \nlack of focus on sanitation improvements. These facts have generated considerable support for \nsectoral development among multilateral and bilateral donors and international and local NGOs. \nEach has developed a slightly different approach to dealing with these problems. Through an \nextensive  consensus  building  process,  a  draft  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nStrategy, along with a financial envelope, was developed to help rationalize sector development, \ncreate workable institutional arrangements, and assist the Government in reaching its coverage \ntargets. Appendix 3 describes external assistance in the sector. \n \n9.   The institutional context of the RWSS sector in Nepal is changing as a result of \ndecentralization. The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) remains principally \nresponsible  for  water  supply-related  activity  in  the  country,  including  developing  sector \nstrategies and programs, overseeing budgets, and coordinating external assistance activities. \nThe Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS), under MPPW, has been responsible \nfor water supply in semiurban and rural areas. It is required to hand over completed schemes to \nlocal authorities and water user groups (WUGs) for operation and maintenance (O&M). DWSS \nhas been unable to adequately address issues, in the past, with regard to gender, participation, \nand NGO involvement. The Government is restructuring DWSS by changing its role from \nimplementation to facilitation (technical support, regulation, quality control and monitoring, etc.). \nPlanning and implementing of smaller schemes will be decentralized to the district level and \nbeneficiary  communities.  The  Project\u2019s  decentralized  policy  and  implementation  modality \nstrongly support the letter and spirit of the LSGA of 1999, and is intended to support institutional \nreform and decentralization. This approach promotes good local governance through a project \nimplementation  framework  mandating  full  participation  by  beneficiary  groups  in  subproject \nplanning, implementation, and follow-up support. \n \n10.  As the lead provider of external assistance, ADB has completed four rural water supply \nand sanitation projects in Nepal since 1985, for a total of $65 million. The latest, the fourth \nRWSS4 project, was successfully completed in early 2002. The primary lessons learned through \nefforts of ADB5 and others in the sector are (i) the importance of emphasizing community \nconsultation, mobilization, to improve system sustainability; (ii) the need for inclusive gender, \ncaste and ethnic minority implementation modalities; (iii) the need to emphasize hygiene and \nsanitation education programs to maximize the impact of external assistance interventions; and \n(iv) the need for closer coordination between assistance efforts to avoid redundancies and \nidentify potential synergies. \n \n11.  The  consensus  building  process  undertaken  during  project  preparation  revealed \nsignificant agreement on many substantive issues including community contribution; the need \nfor gender, caste, and ethnic sensitivity; the importance of hygiene and sanitation improvement; \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

The process also demonstrated the value of broad participation that included \ngovernment agencies, NGOs, external donors, local authorities representatives, and beneficiary \ncommunities in development if a comprehensive sector strategy is to have local ownership. The \nprocess revealed issues related to institutional arrangements that were not so easily addressed, \ngiven the ongoing decentralization process. The subproject appraisal in five communities and \nthe field visits during fact-finding substantiated and confirmed the statements and conclusions of \nthe stakeholders.  \n \n12.  In line with the Government and ADB policies and the lessons learned6, the Project will \nfinance investments in RWSS to address the critical need to extend the coverage of water \nsupply, sanitation, and community health services to underserved and unserved communities. \nThe Project will focus especially on poorer communities and those in remote areas or in conflict-\naffected areas. The project design is based on the outcomes of a comprehensive stakeholder \nconsensus building exercise undertaken under PPTA NEP-3844, which resulted in the draft \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan. The Project and the \nstrategy and action plan follow the policies spelled out in the National Water Sector Policy and \nStrategy, 1988, the draft National Sanitation Policy, 2002, the 10th National Development Plan, \nNepal\u2019s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, and Nepal\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan. \nThe Project will address key sector issues by (i) including local authorities and community \nparticipation in planning and implementing of RWSS subprojects, with communities contributing \nat least 20% of capital costs and becoming owners of the assets; (ii) delegating O&M of the \nschemes to the WUG; (iii) implementing a strategy to change DWSS\u2019 role from provider to \nfacilitator; and (iv) promoting public awareness campaigns to educate consumers about water \nas a scarce resource and the relationship between water, sanitation, and health.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n13.   The overall objective is to expand the coverage of improved water supply and sanitation \nfacilities to underserved populations, especially to poor and remote areas, and to improve health \nand hygiene practices related to waterborne and sanitation-related diseases. The Project will (i) \nstrengthen participating communities\u2019 capacity and capability to plan, co-finance, implement, \nmanage, operate, and maintain improved WSS facilities; (ii) increase participation of all castes, \nethnic minorities, and women; (iii) increase hygiene education through awareness campaigns; \n(iv) develop the capacity and capability of a wide range of sectoral support organizations, \nincluding NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), to provide efficient and cost-effective \nsupport  to  communities  and  local  authorities;  (v)  support  the  implementation  of  the  1998 \nNational Water Supply Sector Policy and the draft Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nStrategy and Action Plan (Supplementary Appendix C); and (vi) support and strengthen the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization efforts by focusing project activities and decision making at the \nlocal authorities and community levels. \n                                                 \n6 Supplementary Appendix B describes in detail how the project design incorporated these lessons. ", "5 \nB.  Sector Loan Approach \n14.  This Project has been formulated as a sector loan in line with the Government\u2019s 10th \nNational Development Plan and decentralization strategy.  ADB\u2019s sector loan modality was \nselected as the most appropriate method of financing the Project. ADB\u2019s sector loan criteria \nhave been met: (i) as part of the Government\u2019s 10th Plan, the RWSS sector investment plan \nunder the Project is well-conceived and appropriately formulated to meet priority needs of the \nsector; (ii) the sector institutions have the capability to implement the draft RWSS sector \nstrategy; and (iii) sector policies are appropriate. \n \nC.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The Project intends to use a community-based, demand-driven approach to extend WSS \nfacilities to approximately 1,200 communities in the 21 Districts prioritized by the Government, \nADB, and major stakeholders.  Selection of the project districts followed the prioritization set by \nthe gender-adjusted human development index, existing WSS coverage, incidence of diarrhea \nand other waterborne diseases, presence of occupational castes and ethnic minorities, and \nremoteness  from  developed  areas.7  The  Project  has  a  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \ncomponent (the rural component) and an institutional strengthening component. \n1.  The Rural Component \n16.  The rural component will implement RWSS infrastructure (gravity, hand pump on tube \nwell, piped with overhead tank, and rainwater systems) in 21 districts. Beneficiary communities \nwill  implement  WSS  subprojects  with  support  from  NGOs/CBOs,  village  development \ncommittees (VDCs) and DDCs.  The Project will be demand-driven. \n \n17.  Equity and pro-poor considerations through targeted subsidies will be incorporated in the \nrural component,8 based on subproject selection criteria applied by the Water and Sanitation \nSupport Team (WSST) (Appendix 4).  Direct subsidy for latrine construction is recommended for \npoor households as defined by indicators such as food insufficiency, households with female \nheads, wage laborers, or disability. \n \n18.  A  demand-driven  approach  will  be  used  to  achieve  institutional  and  financial \nsustainability of the project benefits.  To achieve this end, the direct beneficiaries will be \nrequired  to  make  minimal  contributions  to  the  Project  to  qualify  for  project  funding.  This \nminimum contribution (local counterpart funding) is as follows: (i) DDCs will be required to \ncontribute up-front and in cash 10% of their locally generated annual revenue for the previous \nfiscal  year;  (ii)  VDCs  will  contribute  up-front  and  in  cash  2.5%  of  the  total  cost  of  the \nconstruction of the schemes within the jurisdiction of the VDCs to the relevant water user and \nsanitation committee (WUSC)9 project accounts; and (iii) all communities wishing to participate \nin the Project will be required to contribute at least 20%10 with more than 1% of this 20% in \ncash. Communities must also be willing to take full managerial and financial responsibility for \nO&M. The Project requires that regular O&M costs be fully borne by the WUG members.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Supplementary Appendix D lists the districts and gives the district selection criteria. \n8  Equity and pro-poor considerations are set out in the Government\u2019s Community Contribution in Water Supply and \nSanitation Policy, 2002. \n9  WUGs comprise the WUSC, which is the legal entity elected by and representing the WUGs. \n10 For poor communities in remote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution will be reduced to 10% as set out in \nthe Government's Policy on Community Contribution, 2002. ", "6 \n19.  The rural component will include the following activities: \na.  Community Mobilization and Capacity Building for Sustainability \n20.  The rural component focuses on developing ownership of the subprojects by the project \nbeneficiaries,  who  will  organize  into  WUGs  and  participate  actively  in  design  and \nimplementation.  The Project will train and assist communities to organize WUGs; develop their \ncapacity  to  plan,  construct,  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  water  supply  schemes  and \nsanitation facilities, and ensure the sustainability of water supply after project completion.11   \n \n21.  The WUG will plan, build, manage and operate, and maintain their water supply and \npublic sanitation facilities. This requirement will be made explicit to community members during \ninitial community mobilization before any formal commitment by the Project, or the community. \nWUG members will receive training in the importance of O&M support, and guidelines for tariff \nsetting  and  revenue  collection  to  ensure  that  funds  are  available  for  O&M.  The  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will develop manuals to distribute to the DDCs and the WUGs. In \naddition, village maintenance workers, preferably married women (who are more likely to remain \nin the village), will be selected and trained to operate and maintain the facilities provided.  To \nensure that funds will be available for O&M and to foster the practice of tariff collection, \ncommunities must establish an O&M fund. \nb.  Construction of Community Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n22.  The proposed Project will finance the construction by WUG of water supply schemes12 in \napproximately 1,200 communities,13 including the rehabilitation of approximately 250 existing \nschemes. The 1,200 schemes will be approximately 65% gravity, 23% tube well, 11% overhead \ntank, and 1% rainwater. The main technical options for water supply under the Project are (i) \ngravity pipe system (ii) rainwater harvesting (iii) piped systems with overhead tank and (iv) \ngroundwater  wells  with  hand  pumps.  The  WUG  will  select  the  appropriate  water  supply \ntechnology from the options in the project technical guidelines.14 \n \n23.  The  Project  will  also  (i)  set  up  a  Sanitation  Revolving  Fund  to  provide  credit  for \nconstruction  of  individual  family  latrines,  and  (ii)  finance  sanitation  facilities  for  schools. \nManagement and operation of the fund will reflect best practice as established by the Fund \nBoard that uses this approach to support community sanitation. The Sanitation Revolving Fund \nwill provide initial seed money for the community revolving fund and will be sufficient to provide \ncredit to 25% of the households to build approximately 30,000 family latrines.15 The Project will \nprovide subsidies of NRs5,000 in the terai and NRs3,000 in the hills to 10% of the poorest \nhouseholds  in  each  community.  The  beneficiaries  will  choose  among  simple  pit  latrines, \nventilated improved pit latrines, double pit latrines, and pour flush latrines. \n \n24.  The rural component will support the current National Water Supply Policy (1998) by \nmaking  WUGs  the  center  of  implementation.  The  WUGs  will  register  according  to  Water \nResource Act 1992 to establish a WUSC. Each WUG will apply for a license under the terms of \nWater Supply Regulations 1998, after which it will be entitled to construct, operate, and maintain \n                                                 \n11 Supplementary Appendix E describes the roles and responsibilities of the WUG and their elected WUSC. \n12  Includes water treatment to meet WHO water quality standard if required. \n13 Can include ongoing Government schemes if they are in district plan and all project conditions have been met.   \n14  Supplementary Appendix F describes the project technical guidelines for the schemes. \n15  Under the Sanitation Revolving Fund, the maximum credit for constructing a latrine will amount to NRs7,500 in the \nterai and NRs5,000 in the hills. ", "7 \nthe scheme, and charge consumers for water provided to them. To ensure the sustainability and \nactive participation of the community, the WUG will contribute to the scheme as follows: (i) at \nleast 20% of the cost of the scheme16 with at least 1% of that 20% to be up-front in cash; and (ii) \nthe estimated cost of 1 year of O&M of the scheme up-front in cash. With poor communities in \nremote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution is reduced to 10%17 under the terms in the \nnational Community Contribution in Water Supply and Sanitation Policy, 2002. \nc.  Health and Hygiene Program \n25.  To maximize the health impact of project interventions, and to reduce the incidence of \ndiarrhea  and  other  waterborne  diseases,  the  Project  will  adopt  the  hygiene  improvement \nframework18 and will (i) train and support DDCs, VDCs, and community leaders in planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluating of sanitation and hygiene improvement following the guidelines set \nout in the basic sanitation package19 developed by United Nations Children's Fund/DWSS; and \n(ii) implement for WUG members and beneficiary communities awareness programs in hygiene, \nhealth and sanitation practices. The Project will specifically incorporate gender-appropriate and \nuser-friendly approaches for boys, girls, men and women, and out-of-school children. \nd.  Gender, Caste and Ethnic Minority Program \n26.  Traditionally, women, lower caste members, and ethnic minorities have not participated \nfully in community decision making. Some castes and ethnic minorities have had restricted \naccess to WSS provided through projects. The rural component will implement training and \nawareness programs to increase active participation of disadvantaged groups and women in all \nproject activities. As a condition for funding, communities will have to form a WUSC with at least \na proportional representation of poor, castes, ethnic minority groups and with at least 50% of \ntheir executive and general members being women (of any caste or ethnic group).  Proportional \nrepresentation by the Project means that if, for example 30% of households in a community are \nDalits, then at least 30% of the members of the WUSC must be Dalits (regardless of gender). \nAppendix 5 describes the targets and activities in a program set for the poor, gender and castes \nand ethnic minority group.   \n2.  The Institutional Strengthening Component \n27.  The institutional component will support the implementation of the National Water Supply \nSector Policy,1998 and the draft National Sanitation Policy, 2002, in line with the Government's \ndecentralization  policies  as  set  out  in  the  LSGA.  This  component  will  assist  Government \ninstitutions in the rural water sector to fully take on their new roles and responsibilities assigned \nunder decentralization by strengthening DDCs capacity to provide WSS through a community- \nbased demand-driven approach. The Project will also support MPPW to adopt the institutional \nchanges required by the devolution of functions to DDCs. \n                                                 \n16  Including contribution in kind. \n17 Community contribution follows the requirements set out in the Government\u2019s Community Contribution in Water \nSupply and Sanitation Policy. 2002. Cost of airfreight transportation for equipment and materials will be excluded. \n18 The  hygiene  improvement  framework  provides  an  integrated  approach  that  combines  expanded  access  to \nhardware with hygiene promotion and supportive enabling environments to reduce diarrheal disease. \n19  DWSS and the PMU will revise the basic sanitation package before implementating of the Health and Hygiene \nProgram. ", "8 \na.  Strengthening  DDC  Capacity  to  Provide  Water  Supply  and \n  Sanitation \n28.  The Project will train and give technical support to participating DDCs to allow them to \nplan, manage, monitor, and evaluate demand-driven community-based RWSS projects; and to \nimplement and monitor gender and caste and ethnic minority groups programs, and health, \nhygiene, and sanitation awareness programs. \n \n29.  The Project will provide support to consolidate and develop materials, training packages \nand manuals focusing on community participation, O&M of RWSS, and gender, caste and \nethnicity issues, which will be incorporated in the various training programs to be conducted at \nthe district, village, and community levels. The Project will also provide for technical assistance \nto orient project staff and stakeholders on these issues and to monitor their progress to ensure \nthat such issues are not overlooked during the various stages of the project and individual \nscheme cycle. \n \n30.  Project support to each DDC's WSST will be for a period of 4 years (two full subproject \ncycles) upon their satisfactory performance in meeting sector targets and successful progress in \nimplementing and complying with project guidelines. Funding to DDCs in the first year for pilot \nsubprojects  will  be  in  accordance  with  their  annual  plans  and  provision  of  the  DDC \ncontributions.  Further  funding  for  community  mobilization  and  scheme  construction  in \nsubsequent years will depend on the performance of each DDC. DDCs may continue to access \nproject funds beyond two subproject cycles if their performance continues to be satisfactory. \nDDCs' performance will be monitored by the PMU, the MPPW Sector Monitoring and Evaluation \nUnit, and the RWSS sector stakeholder group.   \n \nb.  Supporting the Decentralization Policy and DWSS  \n31.  The Project will provide technical assistance for developing and implementing a strategy \nto improve human resource allocation in line with the new roles and responsibilities of DWSS \ndefined under the RWSS sector strategy and action plan and in line with the LSGA. The Project \nwill also (i) undertake a human resource review reflecting DWSS\u2019 new role and train DWSS in \nits new role, including developing and maintaining standardized databases of WSS facilities and \nservices; (ii) rationalize and make consistent the National Water Supply Sector Policy, 1998 with \nthe RWSS Sector Strategy and the existing policies and regulations affecting the RWSS sector; \nand (iii) give technical support to project implementation, such as the development of standards, \nmanuals, and detailed technical guidelines for RWSS.   \nD.  Special Features \n32.  Ethnic Diversity. All ethnic groups in the project area are significantly represented in \nthe beneficiary population. The activities in the rural component pay particular attention to \nincluding all ethnic and caste groups so that benefits will accrue equally to all groups residing in \nthe communities. \n \n33.  Demand-Driven  and  Participatory  Approach  through  NGOs/CBOs.  The  rural \ncomponent is based on a demand-driven participatory approach facilitated by NGOs to help the \nbeneficiaries organize into WUGs and collectively take responsibility for implementation and \nO&M  of  the  water  systems.  The  counterpart  NGOs  work  with  the  communities  to  raise \nawareness and introduce the project methodology. Communities are required to show their \ncommitment by contributing 20% of the capital cost of schemes. The beneficiaries decide on the ", "9 \ntype  of  technology  and,  with  the  assistance  of  WSST  and  NGOs,  take  responsibility  for \ndesigning and implementing the schemes. The Project provides the beneficiaries with training \nand practical experience in project and financial management, which will provide communities \nwith the skills to initiate other community improvements.  \n \n34.  NGOs-Supported Community-Based  Approach.  National and district-based NGOs \nare central to project implementation. NGOs will be engaged to provide awareness programs \nand train community members and their WUSCs. The NGOs will assist each participating \ncommunity in planning and implementing construction activities and in monitoring and reporting \non progress. This NGO-supported community-based approach reflects best practices in Nepal \nand is successful in there.  Local and district-based NGOs and CBOs have remained active in \nthe conflict areas over the past several years of the insurgency. Because they were not \npolitically driven and were able to work with both sides to help meet the needs of communities, \nNGOs are able to continue their social and local infrastructure development projects. \n \n35.  Support to Decentralization. The Project supports the Government\u2019s decentralization \nstrategy and helps implement it by focusing project implementation at the district level and using \nNGOs and private sector organizations to assist with implementation at the community level. \nThe DDC will receive training and assistance to develop their skills and to enhance their \ncapacity to work with NGOs and CBOs using participatory, demand-driven approaches.  \n \n36.  Policy. A unified program approach has been created by first developing the RWSS \nSector Strategy and Action Plan through consultative stakeholder workshops that thoroughly \ninvolved the sector stakeholders at every step. This process resulted in several specific policy \nrecommendations to update relevant sector policies and strategies. The Project assists ongoing \npolicy reforms through support to the formal stakeholder group, which has a sector policy role. \nThe Project also provides resources to enable DWSS to adapt to its new role in the sector. \nE.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The project cost presented in Table 1 is based on an indicative 1,200 subprojects and \nother components as well as discussions with stakeholders and field visits. The total cost of the \nProject is estimated at $35.7 million equivalent, including about $2.3 million equivalent for duties \nand taxes. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $12.1 million, or about 34% of the total \nproject cost, including $0.7 million for interest on the ADB loan during construction. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $23.6 million equivalent, about 66% of the total project cost. \nDetailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Project Cost by Component \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local   \nProject Componenta  Exchange  Currency    Total \nA.

", "10 \nF.  Financing Plan \n38.   It is proposed that ADB provide a sector loan of $24.0 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, which will represent 67% of the total cost of the Project. The ADB loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. ADB will cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs \nand part of the local currency costs. DDCs, VDCs, and the beneficiaries themselves will meet \nthe balance of 32% of the intervention.  \n \n39.  ADB will cover a portion of the costs relating to civil works, office equipment, consulting \nservices, and training and public awareness and education campaigns, but will not include the \nsalaries of regular project staff, procurement of vehicles20 (excluding motorcycles), rental of \noffice space, and taxes and duties. The financing of the local currency cost by ADB is justified \nby the nature of the Project, which will address local poverty, gender concerns, caste and ethnic \nminorities, and environmental health issues in the project areas. The Government will disburse \nthe funds to DDCs as a grant through budgetary allocation.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \na.  Central Level \n40.  The Ministry of Planning and Physical Works will be the Executing Agency. MPPW has \ndelegated to DWSS authority to execute the Project. A PMU under DWSS will be established in \nKathmandu to support the Project. A national project steering committee (NPSC), chaired by the \nsecretary MPPW, who will be the sector coordinator, will guide the PMU and make all policy and \nstrategic decisions. The Government will establish the sector stakeholder group21 chaired by the \nsecretary MPPW, and will call for a meeting at least twice a year to ensure (i) coordination of \nsector  reforms  and  interventions  supported  by  external  funds  and  the  Government,  and \n(ii) exchange of information.  \n \n                                                 \n20 As per current ADB/Nepal policy on the use of motor vehicles. \n21 The  sector  stakeholder  group  will  include  representatives  of  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment (MLD), National Planning Council (NPC), DWSS, Association of District Development Committees \nNepal (ADDCN), Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Water Resources, the Fund Board, ADB, World Bank, \nDepartment for International Development, UNICEF, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finland, Water Aid, Helvetas, the \nprivate sector, and others. ", "11 \n41.  The  NPSC  will  provide  overall  coordination  and  guidance  for  the  Project.22  During \nimplementation, the NPSC will deal with policy matters as they arise, and coordinate with other \nministries and agencies. It will meet every 3 months, or as often as necessary. \n \n42.  The PMU will be established within DWSS\u2019 Kathmandu office. An experienced project \ndirector at the level of a Class I officer with sector experience will be appointed to head the PMU \nfor the duration of the Project. A core team of MPPW/DWSS counterparts, along with a team of \ninternational and domestic consultants, will assist the project director. Supported by the PMU, \nthe project director will coordinate all activities under the Project; will be directly responsible for \noverall project management, monitoring, and supervision under the guidance of the director \ngeneral of DWSS; and will report to the MPPW secretary. \n \n43.  The PMU will (i) prepare the overall project implementation plan and consolidated \nannual work plan; (ii) consolidate and develop training materials, policy manuals, and technical \nguidelines; (iii) assist eligible DDCs in preparing annual and periodic plans for the RWSS sector;  \n(iv) provide management and technical support to DDCs; (v) monitor and supervise all project \nmanagement activities; (vi) organize all monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; (vii) ensure \nsatisfactory implementation of the gender action plan and caste and ethnic minority programs; \n(viii)  liaise  with  the  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit  of  MPPW;  (ix)  carry  out  financial \nmanagement and reporting of project accounts; and (x) prepare necessary progress reports and \nthe project completion report. The PMU will be properly staffed and assisted by consultants with \nexpertise in gender and social development, institutional reform, finance and accounting, M&E, \nhealth and hygiene, water supply, and contract management.23 \nb.  District Level \n44.  The DDCs will be the project implementation agency at district level. A WSST will be \nestablished in each district as soon as it enters into a project agreement with MPPW that \ndelineates project implementation arrangements including consulting requirements. The WSST \nteam leader will be a Class II officer with sector experience, and appointed by MPPW in \nconsultation with of the DDC chairperson. The officer will report directly to the DDC chairperson. \nA core team of DDC counterpart staff of at least one water supply engineer, two overseers, one \ncommunity development officer, and one accountant (full- time and for the duration of the \nProject), along with a team of domestic consultants (gender and social development, financial \naccounting, procurement and contract management, and M&E) will assist the WSST team \nleader. If the DDC is unable to provide the required counterpart staff, the DDC will request \nMPPW to depute staff. \n \n45.   A district water coordination committee (DWCC) chaired by the chairperson of the DDC \nwill be established in each DDC to guide and coordinate the activities of DDCs, VDCs, and \ncommunities, and liaise with the PMU. Each participating VDC will be staffed by at least one full-\ntime secretary for the duration of the project. \n  \n46.  DDCs will contract NGOs, CBOs and consulting firms to initially contact communities \npotentially interested in participating in the Project. Interested communities, assisted by VDCs \nand  NGOs/CBOs,  will  develop  and  submit  applications  for  project  assistance.  These \napplications will be reviewed and prioritized by the DDC to be included in the district periodic \n                                                 \n22 The National Project Steering Committee will be chaired by the Secretary of MPPW and will include the Director \nGeneral of DWSS as member secretary and representatives from MOF, NPC, MPPW, MLD, MOH, Ministry of \nWater Resources, and the ADDCN.  \n23  Details of PMU and WSST responsibilities are in Supplementary Appendix G. ", "12 \nand annual plans. NGOs/CBOs will (i) assist the selected communities to establish WUGs; (ii) \nguide communities through the creation of a community action plan; (iii) assist and train WUGs \non planning, procurement, construction, management, O&M of water supply schemes; and (iv) \nincrease awareness on gender, castes and ethnic minorities and implement a WUG strategy to \nensure active participation of these groups and compliance with the proportional representation \nand gender targets. Consulting firms may be engaged to undertake specific tasks in support of \nthe  Project,  such  as  technical  and  financial  audits,  training  the  DDCs  and  NGOs,  and \nevaluations. \n \n47.  The PMU will procure equipment only for PMU-related activities. It will contract firms and \nNGOs for PMU-related activities and for activities to be carried out by the WSST. The WSST will \nprocure equipment and materials for their respective activities and will assist WUSCs to contract \nall NGOs and firms required for supporting their activities. WUSCs will procure all materials and \ncivil works for constructing the water and sanitation schemes.  \n \n48.  At the start of the Project, the WSSTs will help the DDC formulate a budget for all project \nactivities, with estimates for each year of implementation. The budgets will be reviewed by the \nPMU  and  ADB  and  updated  annually.  Expenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by  the \nimplementing  WSST  and  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  compiling  project \nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  WSSTs.  It  will  report  project \nexpenditures monthly to MPPW and MOF, with copies to ADB, with quarterly and annual \nsummaries.  \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n49.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. The institutional component will start in \nthe first quarter of 2004. Development and consolidation of manuals and technical guidelines \nwill be completed by the end of the first year. The rural component will have five batches (1 pilot \nbatch and 4 batches). Each batch will have three phases and an implementation period of 3 \nyears. The pilot batch will have four districts with additional districts in the succeeding batches. \nDuring phase 1, the DDCs will prepare, in consultation with the VDCs and communities, their \nannual district plans for RWSS. In phase 2, they will begin mobilizing and training communities \nand form WUGs and register WUSCs. Community contribution will be collected during phase 2. \nDuring  phase  3,  DDCs  will  support  and  monitor  the  construction  of  water  and  sanitation \nschemes by WUGs. Each phase is expected to last from 6 months to a year. The 21 DDCs will \nbe clustered into 5 groups as agreed with the Government.  The project implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n3.  Procurement \n50.  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nAs contracts are expected to be small, international contractors are not likely to be interested \nand therefore international competitive bidding will not be required.  All equipment and materials \nas well as service motorcycles will be procured through international shopping. Certain items \nmay  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Some \nequipment and vehicles packaged at a contract value of less than $50,000 will be procured \nunder direct purchase procedures. Civil works contracts of the rural component will be small \nwith  average  value  in  the  range  of  $10,000  to  $15,000  equivalent  and  will  follow  ADB's ", "13 \ncommunity participation in procurement in the guidelines. The proposed procurement packages \nare in Appendix 8. \n4.  Consulting Services \n51.  Consulting  services  of  1,217  person-months  are  required  to  facilitate  project \nimplementation and to strengthen the institutional, administrative, and financial capacities of \nMPPW  and  DDCs.  One  consulting  firm  will  provide  consulting  services  for  the  PMU.  \nInternational  consultants  will  be  involved  in  project  management,  capacity-building,  and \nmonitoring  activities.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  in  the  PMU  will  advise \nDWSS/MPPW  on  best  international  practices  in  designing  strategies  to  implement  the \ninstitutional strengthening component and the gender, caste, and ethnic and related social \nprograms.  \n \n52.  For the rural component, there will be 10 consulting contracts, 2 contracts per batch of \ndistricts.24 The PMU will contract suitable private sector organizations and/or NGOs to assist the \nDDCs in project management and implementation of social programs. The consultants (which \ncan include NGOs/private sector organizations) to be financed under the loan will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using a quality-and cost-based \nselection  method  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. Summary terms of reference for all consulting services are in Appendix 9. \n \n53.  The DDC will engage NGOs to facilitate community mobilization and carry out the \nhealth, hygiene, and sanitation campaigns. The WUSC will engage NGOs to help implement the \nwater and sanitation schemes. The NGOs will be selected following criteria developed under the \nProject.25  \n5.    Disbursement Arrangements \n54.  To facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and counterpart funds and to expedite \nimplementation, the Government will, as a condition for loan effectiveness, open a WSS sector \naccount  at  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  Project  funding  (other  than  local  counterpart  funds) \ncomprising (i) counterpart funds provided by the central Government, and (ii) ADB funding will \nbe pooled at the sector account and then channeled to pay all costs of the Project (other than \ncosts  funded  by  the  local  counterpart  funds)  via  the  following  routes:  (a)  to  the  district \ndevelopment funds (DDF) and then into each DDC\u2019s project operating account, and (b) into the \nPMU project operating account. From each DDC\u2019s project operating account, the funds will be \nused to pay incremental WSST salaries and wages and to give the WUSCs funds to pay the \ncosts of the schemes. The funds that are paid to the PMU operating account will fund the \noperations of the PMU. The PMU will prepare disbursement projections, request budgetary \nallocations  for  the  central  counterpart  funds,  collect  supporting  documents,  and  prepare \nwithdrawal applications and send them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. Central counterpart funds via this channeling arrangement will be allocated to the \nProject annually by the Government through \u201cRed Book\u201d allocations. ADB funding of the Project \nwill periodically be disbursed from the ADB loan account into a subaccount of the sector \naccount. The subaccount will be dedicated to operate de facto as an imprest account for the \nADB funding of the Project. The imprest account will be replenished as often as needed, subject \nto the following conditions: (i) the ADB loan is drawn in six payment milestone amounts, and \n                                                 \n24 One package will include the regional social development specialist and M&E specialist for each batch of districts \n,and one package will include a financial accountant for each. \n25  The selection criteria for prequalifying NGOs are in Supplementary Appendix H. ", "14 \ndisbursement of each amount will depend on satisfying the relevant project milestone conditions \n(Appendix 10); (ii) at no point may the balance of the account exceed the lesser of $2.4 million \nor 6 months estimated expenditure. ADB will monitor the achievement of project milestones via \nthe monitoring and progress reports submitted by the PMU and recommendations of the sector \nstakeholder group and the MPPW Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. ADB will only then approve \nthe replenishment of the sector account.  \n \n55.  To facilitate implementation the rural component and in keeping with the Government\u2019s \npolicy on decentralization and the National Water Supply Sector Policy, a project operating \naccount will be established in each DDC for the rural component immediately after its selection \nto  participate  in  the  Project.  Irrespective  of  funding  sources  for  the  sector  account, \ndisbursements to each DDC will be made on the understanding that each disbursement may be \nexpended in the following mix of uses: civil works, 65%; community building, 8%; gender, \ncastes,  and  ethnic  minority  program,  12%;  health  and  hygiene  program,  4%;  and  project \nmanagement, 11%. The project operating account will be established only after the Project-\nfinanced financial accountant and procurement specialist are fielded and the DDC accountant is \nappointed. The initial ceiling for each DDC project operating account will be set in accordance \nwith the approved annual district plan and will not exceed $100,000 equivalent.  \n \n56.  For the rural component, when the WUG contributions have been satisfied, each DDC \nwill  deposit  construction  funds  for  subprojects  into  each  of  the  relevant  WUSCs  project \noperating account as a grant. Before disbursing the DDC funds of to any WUSC, the WUSC will \nmake the following contribution and commitments: (i) a cash contribution of at least 1% of the \nestimated construction cost of the scheme into the WUSC project operating account; (ii) 1 year\u2019s \nestimate of the O&M cost into the community\u2019s O&M account; (iii) a commitment to further \ncontribute the balance (beyond any cash contribution) of the 20% of the cost of the scheme in \nkind.  \n \n57.  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  project  operating  accounts  are  established,  and  will \nmanage,  replenish,  and  liquidate  account  balances  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and with detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and \nADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used to liquidate advances from \nthe  subsector  Account.  The  SOE  ceiling  per  disbursement  transaction  is  set  at  $5,000 \nequivalent. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n 58.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation following ADB\u2019s standard procedures. The PMU will obtain and consolidate \nrelevant data from WSSTs. The WSSTs will prepare the project operating accounts and related \nfinancial statements, and records of the SOEs. The PMU will particularly address progress in \nmeeting  the  performance  targets  defined  under  the  sector  loan  modality.  These  progress \nreports will be the basis for directing further funding to the DDCs.  \n \n59.  MPPW/PMU and the WSSTs will maintain accounts and records so that income and \nexpenditures related to the Project are easily identified. They will be assisted by an adequate \nnumber of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a senior financial manager. Additionally, \na financial accountant will assist the PMU and WSSTs to establish the project accounting and \nrecording  systems,  and  to  train  staff  to  maintain  them.  The  accounts  and  statements  of \nexpenditures and revenues related to the Project will be audited annually by an independent ", "15 \nauditor acceptable to ADB.26 WUSC accounts will be audited annually by the WSST/DDC and \nthe DDC project operating account will be audited by the PMU as set forth in the project and \nsubproject agreements.  Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the \nreport of the auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. The \nannual audit will include the audit of the sector account and the operating accounts at DDC and \nPMU, and SOE procedure. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedure should be included in the annual audit report. The PMU will also submit to ADB, \nwithin 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report following \nstandard ADB procedures. MPPW and the DDCs have been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on \ndelayed  submission,  and  the  requirement  for  satisfactory  audited  accounts  of  acceptable \nquality.  \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n60.  To  ensure  that  subprojects  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  project  benefits  are \nmaximized and reach target groups, a M&E program is included in the framework of ADB\u2019s \nproject  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  PPMS  activities  will  be  conducted \nperiodically to gather information from multiple sources to determine whether inputs have \nrendered expected benefits to the target population. The PPMS will also seek to detect any \ndeficiencies and discrepancies between the plan and execution of the Project so that timely \ncorrections can be made to improve resource efficiency, benefits, outcomes, and impacts. \nIndicators to be monitored have been formulated and agreed upon with the Executing Agency. \nSelected indicators pertain to physical progress, project impact with disaggregated data to \ndemonstrate benefits to the poor and targets of the gender, caste and ethnicity program, \ncapacity-building activities, and institutional reform activities.27 The PMU will gather baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic data in each of the 21 DDCs, submit a detailed implementation \nplan for monitoring performance, and prepare benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and \nconcurrence 3 months after work begins in a particular DDC. Thereafter, the PMU will submit \nannual M&E reports to ADB throughout project implementation.  \n8.  Project Review \n61.  Because of the number of districts and components to be covered by the Project, the \nregular joint reviews at least twice a year by ADB and the Government will be supplemented by \na comprehensive midterm review. The routine project reviews will cover the DDCs financial \nperformance and staffing; implementation of the gender, caste, and ethnic minority programs; \nphysical  progress  in  project  implementation;  and  capacity-building activities. The midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  Project  closely  and  to  make \nappropriate adjustments in the design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation arrangements of the \nProject;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation \nperformance  against  project  indicators;  (iv)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants; and (v) identify problems and constraints and, if necessary, recommend changes in \nthe design or the implementation arrangements.  \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB acknowledges that the auditor general of the Kingdom of Nepal is acceptable to it as an independent auditor \nfor the project. \n27  Details of these indicators are in Supplementary Appendix I. ", "16 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n62.   Investments in RWSS will generate significant benefits for approximately 850,000 direct \nbeneficiaries at the community level, for local authorities units (at district and village levels), and \nfor central Government oversight and coordination in accordance with redefined roles for central \nGovernment departments and agencies. Benefits will include (i) poverty reduction in historically \nunderdeveloped areas; (ii) improved conditions for gender, castes and socially excluded groups; \n(iii) improved community health and environmental condition; (iv) improved sector management; \nand  (v) increased sector capacity.   \n1.  Poverty Reduction in Historically Underdeveloped Areas \n63.  Nepal is a very poor country, currently ranked 143rd out of 175 countries on the UNDP \nhuman development index. Socioeconomic surveys28 reveal that household income for more \nthan 85% of households in the 21 target districts is below $48 per month. The Project focuses \non poorer and more remote areas of western and northern Nepal, where RWSS and other rural \ninfrastructure services have long been lacking. Good quality and reliable RWSS will help reduce \npoverty in poor rural communities in many ways. Additional income for project beneficiaries will \naccrue from (i) utilizing the saved time of women and girls for income-generating activities; (ii) \nimproved  family  health  and  reduction  in  health-related  expenditures;  (iii)  reducing  missed \nworkdays due to diarrheal disease in wage earners; and (iv) over the long run, reducing the \nmissed school days for boys and girls. Households that currently use unacceptably low-quality \nwater for drinking that leaves from polluted rivers or ponds will no longer spend so much on \nremedies for diarrhea and other waterborne diseases. Improved community health is also \nreflected in lower welfare costs and more resources available for community programs. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis are in Appendix 11. \n2.  Gender, Castes and Excluded Ethnic Groups \n64.  The main project beneficiaries will be women and girls who now spend 4-5 hours per \nday fetching water, which is often of poor quality, from distant sources. The availability of water \nin or near their homes will save time and improve their (and their families') quality of life due to \nimproved hygienic conditions. Women will be relieved from the stress and discomfort of hauling \nwater, especially during illness and extreme weather. They will be able to spend time and \nenergy on more productive social and economic activities including better child and house care \nand farm production activities such as tending livestock and poultry. By working with the ADB-\nfinanced Empowerment of Women Project (where project implementation overlaps) and its \nmicrocredit promotion activities will also enable communities, particularly women, to pursue \nincome-generating activities. Girls, who share the responsibility for water collection, could then \nbe enrolled in schools. Men and boys will also benefit, but not to the same extent as women and \ngirls. \n \n65.  Socially  excluded  castes  and  ethnic  groups  will  be  specifically  targeted  to  receive \nbenefits, rectifying historically inequitable access to many social services, including RWSS. \nMembers of lower caste and excluded ethnic groups will be actively encouraged to participate in \nproject training activities and RWSS management, thereby providing them with opportunities for \neducation and facilities management that have historically been denied them.   \n                                                 \n28 Socio-economic survey carried out by Nepal Water for Health under TA3844-NEP: Community Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. ", "17 \n3.  Environmental and Health Improvement \n66.  Diarrheal and other waterborne diseases are endemic in Nepal. Infant mortality rates are \nunacceptably high. Typhoid is disturbingly common. All these indicators are generally worse in \nthe remote or poorer areas targeted by this Project.  Health benefits from improved water supply \nwill be significant.  Sanitation improvement will add significantly to health by helping isolate \ndisease pathogens from the household and community environment. Studies have shown that \nregular use of improved sanitation facilities, coupled with hygiene and behavioral change, has a \nconsiderably greater health impact than just the provision of clean water. The project focus on \nhygiene and sanitation behavioral change, such as regularly using improved latrines, washing \nface and hands with soap (or suitable substitutes) at appropriate times will help ensure that \nthese benefits are realized.  \n4.  Institutional and Policy Impacts \n67.  The RWSS Sector Strategy supports the improvement of RWSS facilities and service \ndelivery by establishing a commonly agreed-upon implementation approach. The consensus- \nbuilding process confirmed that a community-based approach placing responsibility for RWSS \nimplementation in the hands of communities with support from district and village government \nand NGOs should be adopted.  This Project builds on the experience of other donors, adopting \nand supporting successful institutional arrangements and strengthening institutional capacity to \nplan,  implement,  and  monitor  RWSS  projects  in  accordance  with  the  Government's \ndecentralization process and the community-based approach.   \n \n68.  The Government\u2019s long-term governance strategy is based on decentralizing central \nGovernment roles, including responsibilities and authority for many services such as RWSS, to \nlocal authorities. The LSGA establishes the legal framework for decentralization. Districts and \nvillages will develop the capacity to take on the new decentralized responsibilities. Capacity will \nbe improved so that districts will be able to plan and manage sector activities, and support \neducation and training for community-based projects.  Participating communities, with NGO \nsupport, will be able to build their own RWSS facilities and establish the capacity to operate, \nmaintain, and repair the systems.   \n \n69.  The Project will also support institutional reform and capacity building within DWSS, the \nlead central Government agency in the sector.  DWSS will improve its capacity to support the \nsector through coordination, technical support, training, and other sector facilitation activities \nwhile at the same time relinquishing direct implementation responsibility for the RWSS sector. \nEstablishing a rational staffing pattern will be a component of the reform process.   \n \n5.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n70.  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects was applied to five subprojects \nin the rural areas, covering five districts and with the application of every possible technical \nsolution envisaged to be financed under the Project. The average economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) for the five schemes is estimated at 68%; for the individual schemes, the EIRR \nranged from 24% to 94%. The estimated EIRR for the Project as a whole is about 14%. The \nfigure is conservative, as it does not include benefits derived from sanitation improvements and \nhealth  benefits.  Because  the  analysis  is  based  on  a  five  subproject  sample,  it  is  not \nrepresentative of the substantial macro benefits arising from the intervention. These benefits are \ndiscussed fully in Appendix 12.   ", "18 \nB.  Risks \n71.   Policy.  It  is  assumed  that  implementing  the  institutional  reforms  related  to \ndecentralization will continue.  Institutional reforms in the RWSS sector are required to reflect \nthe decentralization process and changing institutional roles. The institutional strengthening \ncomponent  is  designed  to  support  this  momentum  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nDWSS/MPPW to function as a sector facilitator and implement the RWSS Sector Strategy and \nAction Plan in coordination with other external agencies. \n \n72.  The risk is that the to-be-approved sector strategy is not acted on by Government \nagencies and other donors, and that the harmonization process does not continue. Another risk \nis that NGOs do not see their experiences incorporated into Government-supported projects. \n \n73.  Institutional  Capacity.  Insufficient  institutional  capacity,  particularly  at  the  local \nauthorities level, poses a risk to the implementation of the rural component. Weak local NGO \ncapacity and capability in remote and poorer districts could make it difficult to mobilize qualified \nNGOs there. The Project will train and support the DDCs to build their capacity and the capacity \nof district-based NGOs. In addition, the Government will provide the necessary budgetary \nallocations for the DDCs to  have at least one water supply engineer, two overseers, one \ncommunity development officer, and one accountant as counterpart to be trained and to work \nfull-time on the Project. \n \n74.  Local  Administration.  The  Project  assumes  a  stable  political  and  economic \nenvironment at the local level.  The lack of locally elected officials at the DDC and VDC levels \nweakens the participatory decentralized approach and may reduce community trust.  District \nand village authorities are currently being managed by civil servants.  Dedicated civil servants \n(in a lot of cases informally supported by former elected officials) working at the district level \n(principally, local development officers) do make efforts to be responsive to community needs \nwithin the constraints imposed by the current district administration system. However, the pace \nof project implementation may be affected.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n75.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Before each fiscal year, the Government, in consultation with relevant DDCs and \nthe  PMU,  will  prepare  and  agree  on  adequate  annual  budget  for  central \ncounterpart funds for the fiscal year. \n(ii)  By 16 or 17 July of each year, the Government will allocate central counterpart \nfunds in the amount budgeted in accordance with paragraph (i) in respect of the \nsubsequent fiscal year;

  \n(b)  each WSST, not later than 1 month after selection of the relevant DDC;  \n(c)   NPSC, not later than 1 month after loan effectiveness; and \n(d)   DWCC not later than 1 month after selection of the relevant DDC. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the sector stakeholder group meets at least \ntwice a year. \n(vi)   The Government will ensure that the Project develops an environmental checklist \nat planning stage in accordance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental \nassessment guidelines, and, at all times throughout the implementation of the \nProject, adhere to ADB's environment policy and  guidelines on environmental \nassessment procedures and involuntary resettlement policy. \n(vii)   The Government will support the establishment and registration of WUGs in each \nproject community, pursuant to the relevant bylaws permitting such groups to \ntake legal ownership of, and plan, design, construct, and operate the relevant \ncommunity water scheme. \n(viii)   The Government will review and approve manuals and guidelines developed by \nthe Project for the sector. \n(ix)   The Government will ensure that, in selecting the project target communities, \nDDCs use the community selection criteria set out in Appendix 4. \n(x)   The Government shall inform ADB promptly of any change of the director of the \nPMU or WSST team leader. \n(xi)   The Government will ensure that funding made available by ADB to fund DDCs \nwill be allocated and expended by each DDC as follows:  civil works, no more \nthan 65%; community building, less than 8%; gender, caste, and ethnic minorities \nprogram, no less than 12%; health and hygiene program, no less than 4%; and \nproject management, no less than 11%. \n(xii)   The  Government  agrees  that  no  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  loan \naccount for any subproject or scheme that is in breach of the criteria pertaining to \ndemand-driven, community-based RWSS subproject selection namely: poverty, \nremote location, and unserved or underserved in terms of RWSS coverage. \n(xiii)   The Government will ensure that targets set out in the gender, caste and ethnic \nminorities plans  (Appendix 5) are met by WUG, DDCs and the PMU. \n(xiv)   The  Government  will  ensure  that  before  starting  project  activities  in  any \ncommunity, and as a condition for funding by ADB of the relevant district\u2019s project \nactivities, MPPW and the relevant DDC will enter into a project agreement, to be \nprepared by ADB, regulating the following matters: \n(a)  contribution of local counterpart funding; \n(b)  terms and conditions of release of funding from DDC to WUGs (including \nconditions relating to provision of DDC contribution); \n(c)  establishment and staffing of WSST; and \n(d)  auditing and reporting mechanism to PMU. \n(xv)  The Government will ensure that, for works to be carried out in any community, \nthe relevant DDC, the relevant VDC, and the WUG enter into a contract, \nacceptable in form and substance to ADB, regulating the following matters: \n(a)  provision of the VDC contribution and the WUG contribution;  \n(b)  establishment of minimum specifications and standards for construction \nworks to be performed by the WUG; \n(c)  stablishment of minimum specifications and standards for the operation \nworks to be performed by the WUG; \n(d)  establishment of environmental standards applicable to design, \nconstruction, and O&M of works;  ", "20 \n(e)  cooperation and coordination by WUG with relevant agencies of \nGovernment, including the PMU; \n(f)  project Implementation; and \n(g)  procurement requirements. \n(xvi)  The government shall ensure that by end of Project implementation period, its \nCabinet review its existing policy under which, depending in size of end-user \npopulation settlements, different government line agencies implement rural water \nsupply and sanitation projects. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n76.  The following are conditions for loan effectiveness:  \n(i)  The Government establishes and fully staffs the PMU, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nand maintains it during the term of the Project.  \n(ii)  The Cabinet approves the RWSS sector strategy and its associated action plan. \n(ii)  The Government shall have confirmed that the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit \nunder MPPW is operational. \n(iii)  The Government opens the sector account at the Nepal Rastra Bank. \n \nC.  Condition for Initial Disbursement  \n77.

Evaluating the Capacity of Government Institutions \n1.  The national framework for decentralized governance has been established under the \nLocal Self-Governance Act (1999) and is now being implemented. Historical sector roles and \nresponsibilities are changing, with local governments taking on additional responsibilities. The \nchange  has  required  the  creation  of  transitional  structures  to  manage  some  devolved \nresponsibilities  on  an  interim  basis  until  the  decentralization  process  is  complete.  The \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization implementation plan (DIP) outlines the plan and schedule for \nachieving  the  decentralization  goals.  The  following  table  outlines  the  current  functions  of \nnational and district agencies. \nWSS-Related Functions on Different Tiers of Government \nAgency  Function  Current Capacity  Comment \nMPPW  Has lead role in WSS sector policy  10 staff allocated to  DWSS is the \ndevelopment.

Once local government elections are held, DDCs \nwill be able to take more direct responsibility for planning and providing services based on local \npriorities. The Decentralization Implementation and Monitoring Committee in its third meeting in \nJanuary 2002 approved the DIP and has agreed to a time frame of 5 years for establishing \nsector sections (including water supply and sanitation [WSS]) in all DDCs.  \n3.  The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (the Fund Board), a \nformal agency of government, is constituted as an autonomous entity under the supervision of \nthe Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW).  Since its establishment in 1996, the \nFund Board has developed a demand-led community-based implementation modality that has \nfocused on direct intervention at the community level by nongovernment organizations (NGO) \nsupport organizations.  This program has created a cadre of NGOs with experience in working \nto support the sector.  Along with those of several national NGOs, this program, has provided \nvaluable lessons to the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector. The implementation \napproach for the ADB investment is modeled on these modalities.   \nB.  NGO and Private Sector Capacity \n4.  More than 80 national and district-based NGOs have successfully implemented WSS \nprojects financed by aid agencies. Because NGOs focus at the community level, they have \nbeen more effective in supporting social mobilization and other community capacity building \nneeds. NGOs with the proper training have proved to be good partners in assisting communities \ndevelop and implement schemes.  More NGOs are now being established at the district level. \nHowever, more remote and poorer districts are less likely to have active and capable NGOs. In \nsuch  cases  strong  orientation  programs  will  be  necessary  to  attract  capable  NGOs  and \nstrengthen district-based NGO capacity. The Fund Board has been supporting such NGO \norientation and has trained a large number of NGOs. \n5.  Private  sector  organizations  (PSOs)  are  supporting  the  RWSS  sector  by  providing \ntechnical support for design, construction, and operation and maintenance, training, monitoring \nand evaluation, technical auditing, and special studies. Such capacity is largely restricted to \nurban areas and is very limited in the remoter districts.  The specific skills of PSOs have been \nutlilized to advantage even in rural and remote areas through contracts for specific services \noutlined above.  \nC.  Planning and Flow of Funds  \n6.  Under  the  participatory  development  planning  process,  the  National  Planning \nCommission (NPC) and sectoral ministries send to the districts information and directives, along \nwith  budget  ceilings,  for  each  year\u2019s  development  plan.  Planning  is  a  14-step  process, \nculminating in  approval of the district council plan. The DDC forwards the annual district \ndevelopment plan to NPC through the Ministry of Local Development (MLD).  DDCs also \nforward sectoral program plans to sectoral ministries. In the past, DDC plans and budgets have \nbeen subject to modification at central levels. Efforts are now being made to restrict such \nmodifications. DDC and sectoral ministry plans are approved at the national level with budget \ndetails published in the \u201cRed Book.\u201d  The process starts in mid-November and ends in March. \nThe fiscal year starts in mid-July with release of funds in the following weeks or months.  At the \nend of the fiscal year, all Government accounts are frozen and with unspent funds returned to \nthe Ministry of Finance.  \n7.  The Government recently mandated that district-level program budgets flow directly to \nDDCs  for  FY2002/03.  This  changes  the  past  practice  that  channeled  funds  for  sectoral \nprograms through sectoral ministries. This system was introduced even though departments of \nsectoral ministries may still implement district-level programs.  Bloc grants to support DDC ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nactivities (staff salaries, operating expanses, and limited program budgets) continue to flow \ndirectly to the DDC as before. \nD.  RWSS Implementation Capability  \n8.  National policy has, to date, been developed through an informal consultative process. \nGovernment implementation of national RWSS programs has been the responsibility of DWSS \nand  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR) \nthrough district-level departments.  DDCs and village development committees (VDCs) have \nbeen responsible for DDC-initiated programs at the district and village levels.  The Fund Board \nmanages its programs though its centrally located office. NGOs working within the sector are \nlegally bound to the national sector policy, but there is no mechanism to ensure that they \nfunction entirely within the national framework.   \n9.  The  LSGA  now  gives  overall  sectoral  responsibility  for  supporting  RWSS  service \nplanning and provision to DDCs. However, DDC capacity is severely constrained by central \nbudget allocations and staffing. Historically line ministries, such as MPPW, provided capacity in \nrelevant sectors at the district level (DWSS, a department within MPPW, maintains offices in all \ndistricts).  Most RWSS capacity at the district level resides with DWSS offices. In 2002 formal \nresponsibility for smaller systems (serving less than 1,000 people) was given to DOLIDAR, a \ndepartment of MLD, which has closer institutional links to the DDC. The establishment of \nDOLIDAR offices at the district level (DIDO) was followed in late 2002 by the creation of district \ntechnical offices (DTOs) within DDCs but staffed by seconded DOLIDAR personnel.   Approved \nstaffing for DTOs is limited with the Water Supply and Sanitation and Building Section having \none engineer, two overseers, and two water supply technicians in 42 larger districts, and only \none overseer and two water supply technicians in the remaining 33 districts. Many posts within \nDTOs remain vacant.  \n10.  DDCs have five kinds of staff working in the office: (i) Government staff including LDO, \nchief  accountant,  planning  and  administration  officer,  and  DTO  staff  from  MLD  and  its \ndepartments; (ii) administrative staff recruited by the DDC from grants given by the government; \n(iii) administrative staff and technicians paid for from a contingency fund used to cover the \nadministration cost of bloc grant management; (iv) staff recruited by the DDC from its own \nrevenue; and (v) staff assigned to it to manage special programs in the district, such as Remote \nArea Development Program.  All DDC staff except Government are considered temporary and \nGovernment  staff  are  subject  to  transfer  at  any  time.  The  LSGA  provides  for  a  Local \n(Government) Service Act which outlines terms of employment (recruitment, promotion, transfer, \npensions, etc.) and allows DDCs to establish staffing patterns and hire permanent staff.  This \nAct is being prepared.  \n11.  The LSGA provides for sectoral sections within DDCs including a Water Supply and \nSanitation Section.  When established, these sections will plan and manage investments in the \nsector but will not directly implement projects. Government policy supports provision of RWSS \nservices through a community-based approach. Under this approach, communities (through \nlegally constituted water user and sanitation committees) implement RWSS projects with the \nassistance of support organizations.  NGO capacity is well established in some districts, but \nmay not yet be adequate to support the program in rural and remote districts.  The investment \nprogram will orient and train NGOs to build this capacity in participating districts. \nE.  Institutional Strengthening \n12.  The institutional strengthening component is designed to support the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization process and build capacity at local levels to manage and implement RWSS \nprojects. This component will focus on three major areas: (i) DDC training and capacity building, ", "28  Appendix 2 \n(ii) strengthening DWSS capacity to provide technical support, and (iii) strengthening sector \ncoordination and policy development.   \n1.  Local Government Training and Capacity Building \n13.  DDC and VDC capacity in the RWSS sector is weak.  Under the LSGA, these local \nbodies now have formal responsibility for managing and implementing RWSS projects at the \ndistrict and village levels.  Existing technical capacity at the district level currently lies within \nDWSS regional and subregional offices, which are linked to a line ministry department. Limited \ntechnical capacity is available to the DDC through the DDC\u2019s DTO office, staffed by seconded \nDOLIDAR staff. The Project will work toward building local government capacity independent of \nthe line ministries as outlined in the LSGA. This will be accomplished by (i) deputing the \nrequired capacity to manage the Project at the district level to the DDC, thereby giving them \nexperience in planning and managing sectoral work; (ii) training DDC and VDC officials and staff \nin sector policy and strategy, project planning and management, and the social, technical, and \nfinancial aspects of project implementation modalities; (iii) providing funding for training and \nsubprojects directly to the districts through the District Development Fund; and (iv) working with \nDDCs  to  formally  establish  and  staff  the water supply and sanitation sections once local \ngovernment elections are held. Training and capacity building will be enhanced by giving DDCs \nthe responsibility, authority, and funding for RWSS interventions. PMU consultants and staff will \nprovide training and technical assistance.   \n2.  Strengthen DWSS Capacity to Provide Technical Support \n14.  DWSS has been the principal Government agency with RWSS sector responsibility.  \nHowever,  the  LSGA  and  national  policy  mandate  that  DWSS  relinquish  its  historical \nimplementation role and take on a sectoral support and facilitation role. The RWSS sector \nstrategy outlines 12 specific technical support and facilitation roles that fall to DWSS within this \nnew institutional framework.  The Project has been designed to support and strengthen DWSS\u2019 \nrole as sector facilitator by (i) designing the PMU to be a central planning and management unit \nfor  the  sector  so  that  it  fulfils  a  technical  support  and  facilitative  role  during  project \nimplementation; (ii) assisting DWSS establish specific capability areas that DWSS will have \nresponsibility for (the RWSS sector strategy outlines a list of DWSS sectoral responsibilities) \nthrough demonstration and training; and (iii) assisting DWSS outline a process for redeploying \nstaff and rightsizing related to its mandated functions while at the same time retaining the staff it \nneeds within the new institutional structure.  \n3.  Strengthening Policy Development \n15.  Sector stakeholders have begun to share information and discuss policy issues more \nopenly  in  the  broader  context  of  sector  development.  The  Government\u2019s  decentralization \nprogram has already revealed inconsistencies with existing policies and certain weaknesses \nrelated to such issues as rehabilitation of facilities and implementation of schemes. The Project \nwill support continuation of the sector dialogue begun during project conceptualization and \nexpanded during project preparation.

District development communities (DDCs) will prioritize all their communities using the \nproject criteria for community selection.  Project funding will be allocated to communities that \nrank first according to the criteria.  The criteria are based on hardship factors, willingness to \nshare the costs of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS), and poverty and social factors. All \nschemes selected must have already been identified and prioritized in the district development \nplan. Failure to prioritize communities following these criteria will render the DDC noneligible for \nfurther funding. \nA.  Hardship Factors \n2.  For a community to qualify, it must have one or more of the following hardship factors: \n(i)  Time required to fetch water from existing water sources/points, i.e. average time \nto go, wait (if necessary), and return home is more than 30 minutes per round \ntrip. \n(ii)  Existing accessible water sources are available less than 9 months per year. \n(iii)  Existing water sources are highly contaminated (arsenic or fecal coliform >1,500 \npm) or physically prone to contamination (e.g., open dug wells, broken down \ntubewells, rivers, etc.). \n(iv)  Average per capita water consumption is adequate (at least 25 liters per capita \nper day) or inadequate (less than 15). \nB.  Willingness to Share the Costs of RWSS Development \n3.  Communities  wishing  to  participate  in  the  Project  must  make  cash  and  in-kind \ncontributions. They must also be willing to take full financial and managerial responsibility for \noperations and maintenance. Communities can increase their chance of being selected by \nagreeing to pay a higher  percentage of the cost: of the scheme at least 20% community \ncontribution, with >1% in cash. For poor communities in remote inaccessible areas the minimum \ncontribution will be reduced to 10%, although per capita cost may be higher. \nC.  Social and Poverty Factors \n4.  WSS services also need to be provided to poor, socially excluded, and otherwise \ndisadvantaged communities with low income, insufficient food supply, low literacy rate, and high \nmorbidity and mortality rates. According to the Nepal Poverty Assessment 1999 indicators poor \nhouseholds are: \n(i)  households having food sufficiency for less than 6 months in a year; \n(ii)  households whose major source of income is wage from labor; \n(iii)  households with female heads with disabled persons; and \n(iv)  other households with low literacy, unsatisfactory health indicators, etc. \n \n5.  The table gives draft sample of the instrument that DDCs will use to evaluate and rank \ncommunities using the community selection criteria. The PMU in consultation with the sector \nstakeholder group, will finalize the instrument and will submit it for  ADB's concurrence 6 months \nafter project effectiveness.  \n6.  Community selection criteria incorporate both required eligibility elements and ranking \nelements.  Required eligibility criteria must be met before a community can be considered for \ninclusion in the project.   \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nRequired Eligibility Elements  Means of Verification \nDistrict Planning \n1  Community must be included in the DDC plan.

", "32  Appendix 5 \nGENDER, CASTE, AND ETHNICITY AWARENESS AND EMPOWERMENT STRATEGY \nA.  Preparatory Work Undertaken \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) 4th Phase Evaluation, 2001,1 highlighted that lack of \nwoman's participation in decision making in water user and sanitation committees (WUSCs) \nseemed to have an adverse impact on planning, resource utilization, and tariff collection. During \nthe evaluation survey, women questioned the lack of transparency of system costs and illegal \nextensions using private pipelines by WUSC chairmen. The Community-Based Water Supply \nand Sanitation project preparatory technical assistance Sample Survey and the subsequent \nSocioeconomic Survey (SES) findings confirmed that, without targeted intervention, women and \npoor men are all too often excluded from participating in decision making related to project \nplanning for rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) and resource allocation in Nepal. The \npoorest groups\u2014Dalits and other socially excluded ethnic groups\u2014often have unequal access \nto water, sanitation, and other project benefits like training and paid jobs. Empowering women \nand socially excluded men to participate in decision making about improved RWSS resources is \ntherefore a critical issue to be addressed in this Project through intensive social mobilization \nefforts and gender-sensitive processes. \n \nB.  Capacity Building to Promote Women's Involvement in Decision Making \n1.  Central Level \n2.  The project management unit (PMU) located in the Department of Water Supply and \nSewerage under the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, will include an international \ngender/social development specialist who will work with the regional gender/social development \nspecialists in the development phase and first 2 years of implementation. All will work closely \nwith the health and sanitation, technical and monitoring and evaluation specialists to ensure \ngender, caste, ethnicity, and community mobilization objectives are developed, planned, and \nintegrated into project strategies, action plans, and processes.  \n \n2.  District Level \n3.  The  PMU  gender/social  development  specialist  will  orient  the  regional  gender  and \ncommunity development consultants to support the water and sanitation support team (WSST) \ncommunity  development  specialist  and  the  district  development  committee\u2019s  women \ndevelopment officer and to ensure that all WSST staff (including counterpart staff) receive \ntraining on gender awareness and gender, caste, and ethinicity policy and process. The regional \ngender and community development consultant will support WSST officers to initiate and carry \nout their gender-sensitive and socially inclusive coordination and monitoring roles effectively. \n \n3.  Community Level \n4.  Before  nongovernment  organizations/community-based  organizations  (NGOs/CBOs) \nstart implementing subprojects with communities, two staff members will be required to attend \ntraining sessions in gender awareness and project policy and processes for incorporating \ngender, caste, and ethnicity. This will enable NGOs/CBOs to better promote gender awareness \nand to facilitate gender and caste-sensitive processes in a community in all phases of a \nsubproject and in other components such as health and sanitation.  \n                                                 \n1  Benefit, Monitoring and Evaluation of Water Supply and Sanitation Subprojects under the Fourth Rural Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, Main Report, New Era, Kathmandu, September 2001. ", "  Appendix 5  33 \nC.  Targets for Women's Participation and Access to Subproject Benefits \n5.  The following targets will be achieved in implementing this project: \n \n(i)  50% women as executive and general members in WUSCs, with proportional \nrepresentation2 of all castes and ethnic groups residing in the community \n(ii)  WUSCs  to  receive  gender,  caste  and  ethnic  participation  awareness  and \nconfidence building training as part of initial WUSC training \n(iii)  Women as well as men trained as paid village maintenance workers (VMW) and \nsanitation masons where possible, \n(iv)  Men as well as women trained as community health motivators to promote health \nand sanitation to men as well as women, boys, and girls \n(v)  School  water  supply  and  sanitation  construction  to  include  separate  toilet \ncubicles for boys, girls, and teachers. School hygiene and sanitation promotions \nto be extended to out-of-school boys and girls through a child-to-child approach \n(vi)  Paid unskilled labor to the poorest men and women selected in a community at \n50% of the standard daily labor rate \n(vii)  Affordable sanitation options (in the Community Water Supply and Sanitation \nCatalog) available for all socioeconomic groups, and sanitation subsidies to the \n10% poorest households \n(viii)  Women participating in decision making on the number, location, and position of \nwater points, and design modifications to meet practical needs for washing and \nbathing \n(ix)  Participatory  approaches  applied  to  identify  households  by  gender,  caste, \nethnicity, and socioeconomic group \n(x)  Gender analysis and consultation with women conducted in all subprojects \n(xi)  Subsidies to poor communities in remote middle hills and mountain areas for \nRWSS \n(xii)  Community-based revolving funds for sanitation to offer loans for affordable \nlatrines, with appropriate repayment schedules to enable greater access by poor \nmen and women \n \nD.  Gender Monitoring and Evaluation \n6.  The above tasks will be monitored using gender, caste, and ethnicity impact monitoring \nindicators, disaggregated data collected and analyzed incorporated in progress reports by \nNGOs/CBOs, and the project performance management system (WSST/DDCs to PMU).  ADB \nbiannual review missions and the midterm review mission will also evaluate the achievements \nand impacts of the targets. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Proportional representation means that if there are 30% Dalit households in a community, then the WUSC should \nhave 30% Dalit members on the WUSC.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?  Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \n \nThe country poverty analysis describes the provision of basic services for the poor, including water-related needs, as \nbeing fundamental to poverty elimination.  Under the Project, benefits will impact principally on the health and quality \nof life, with full benefits being realized in the longer term.  The Project will enhance household economies in the \npoorest regions of the country.  Anticipated benefits include stronger, more sustainable livelihoods; increased family \nincomes through improved crop production; improved livestock management; improved cottage industries; fewer days \nlost through sickness; reduced medical expenditures; and improved attendance of children, especially girls, at school.  \n \nEconomic analysis for RWSS projects in Nepal indicates that time and energy savings contribute to economic internal \nrates of return of around 24% for gravity schemes and 14% for tube wells.1 These analyses are understood to \nsignificantly understate benefits since they measure only  time savings and ignore significant quality-of-life benefits.  \n \nFetching water is mainly the responsibility of women and girls. Social structures and current levels of education and \nawareness inhibit gender equality.  In the hills, time taken to fetch water, including waiting time at the source, is about \n4.5 hours per household per day. A shorter time to collect water normally results in increased consumption of water, \nwhich will result in improved hygiene (more frequent personal bathing and washing of clothes and utensils) and better \nlivestock maintenance. Health benefits cited by beneficiaries normally include improved quality of life due to better \nphysical health, reduced mental stress (as result of less drudgery), and an improved household economy.  Improving \nin the quality of life by providing basic water and sanitation services will have a profound bearing on poverty levels in \nthe poorest areas of Nepal. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \n \nUnder the Project, low-income families are identified on the basis of annual income. Households with an annual \nincome of less than NRs34,000 ($436) (on the basis of 5.45 members per household) are regarded as poor. The per \ncapita poverty line is therefore NRs6,238 ($80).  \u201cBetter-off\u201d incomes are taken to be those greater than NRs12,844 \n($165).  Socioeconomic analysis of five accessible communities (therefore likely to be relatively well-off) showed that \naround 38% are poor, 43% medium, and 19% better-off.2 \n \nThe short-term  direct  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  will  be  employment  generation  targeted  at  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  groups  in  communities,  especially  women.  Paid  posts  include  health  motivators,  maintenance \ncaretakers, and water and sanitation technicians.  Wages for men and women will be the same.  Low-income families \nwill receive payments for 50% of the time they spend working on the Project,3 and receive concessionary loans and \nsubsidies to support latrine construction. The Project will also benefit the poor through direct support for environmental \nimprovements and improved potential for income generation. The integrated assistance package will have a major \nimpact on the quality of life, confidence, and capabilities of community members. \n \nThe long-term benefits of the Project will arise principally from productive uses of time saved, fewer days lost to \nsickness, and reduced in expenditure on medical treatment.  Sector studies show that 30-38% of time saved is \ngenerally used for economically productive activities such as farming, livestock rearing and maintenance, household \nmaintenance, vegetable gardening, and cottage industries.  Improved nutrition, child care, and opportunities to rest are \nother important benefits normally cited by beneficiaries  \n \nReliable data from which to gauge full health benefits are lacking and would almost certainly prove inconclusive. \nHowever, indirect evidence suggests that improved water supply, sanitation, and hygiene practices directly translate \ninto lower morbidity and mortality from waterborne diseases. Studies4 have found positive relationships between \nconsumption levels of water and personal hygiene, especially in rural areas. Households consuming less than 15 liters \nper capita per day tend to have unsatisfactory hygiene practices compared with those that consume more. Further, \nthere is a correlation between the level of literacy and awareness of personal hygiene. The community education and \nawareness program will promote improved personal hygiene. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1996.

Economic Rationale for the Sectorwide Approach \n \n1.  In the rural water supply and sanitation sector, there is a unique opportunity to apply a \ncoherent sector development approach by the Government of Nepal and a sector support \napproach by collective external agencies in line with declared policies of the Government and \nthe agencies.  An Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported consultative process of more than \n30 workshops in the course of 8 months resulted in the design of a sectorwide approach \n(SWAp) to facilitate meeting the targets set for the sector in the Government\u2019s Tenth Five-Year \nPlan. \n \n2.  The approach decided upon by the Government and ADB raises some critical issues. \n \n(i)  As  a  result  of  the  Local  Self-Government  Act  (LSGA)  of  1999,  the  central \nagencies (Ministry of Physical Planning and Works [MPPW], Ministry of Local \nDevelopment  [MLD],  Ministry  of  Finance  [MOF],  and  the  National  Planning \nCommission [NPC]) need to involve themselves much more deeply and strongly \nwith  planning,  facilitating,  and  monitoring  developments  under  the  SWAp \npartnership; and support and enhance it. There are important implications for \nresource allocation, financing, and financing mechanisms. \n(ii)  It is critical that all echelons of the Government advocates a coherent sector \napproach.  Although  the  decision  makers  at  MPPW,  MLD,  MOF,  and  NPC \nsupport  the  approach  and  are  aware  of  the  opportunities,  officers  at  lower \nechelons  and  decentralized  levels  district  development  committee/village \ndevelopment committee are insufficiently involved. Neither are they aware of the \ndevelopments and the opportunities it offers, and thus continue to promote, \ndevelop, and attract disjunctive and project-based support. \n(iii)  It is to be expected that a considerable part of future external support to the \nsector will be related to direct support to community development and poverty \nreduction in the field. This support should make use of existing structures and \ndecision-making mechanisms at national and district level and avoid creating \nparallel structures. This means that, for the sector approach to work, and agency \ncontributions and the Government\u2019s own budget allocation to the sector should \nbe put in the same planning framework at central and decentralized levels. This \nallows government funding for certain activities, aid agency funding for other \nactivities, and government-donor agency cofinancing for again other activities. \nSWAp is  the only way of providing for coherence and ownership of the sector \nsupport program, and could avoid the need for the Government to allocate \nseparate counterpart funds to some aid agency investments. \n \n3.  The approach taken under this intervention is not based on the size and number of \ninvestments. Instead, the focus is on coordinating aid and the resulting benefits, supporting the \ndecentralization process, and developing capacity at the district and community levels.   \n \n4.  However, in Section B this analysis does assess the outputs directly attributable to this \nintervention \u2013 but the analysis in itself should not be the overall criterion for approving the \nintervention and support to the sector. \n \n ", "Appendix 12  49\nB.  Financial Justification for the Approach \n \n5.  The question\u2014what are the transaction costs of managing aid in Nepal\u2014is a potentially \nuseful one to ask because high transaction costs may indicate inefficiencies and other problems \nin an aid delivery system. It is difficult to quantify transaction costs; therefore this report focuses \nmainly  on  qualitative  problems.  It  is  in  the  interest  of  both  aid  agencies  and  recipient \ngovernments to minimize all aid transaction costs whether they can be measured easily or not.  \nThis is because high transaction costs may \n \n(i)  influence  the  volume  of  aid  delivered,  by  discouraging  donor  agencies  and \ngovernments from entering into agreements and reducing disbursement rates; \n(ii)  reduce aid efficiency, by consuming aid and Government resources that could be \notherwise employed and misallocating the resources made available under aid \nagreements; and  \n(iii)  reduce  aid  effectiveness,  by  encouraging  aid  agencies  and  recipient \ngovernments to allocate resources to activities that do not address development \npriorities and, in some cases, undermining institutional development goals.   \n \n6.  The costs arising from the preparation, negotiation, implementation, monitoring, and \nenforcement of agreements for the delivery of overseas delivery assistance may take the form \nof administration costs (arising from inputs of resources needed for the transaction), indirect \ncosts (resulting from the impact of the delivery mechanism on the achievement of development \ngoals), and opportunity costs (measuring the benefits foregone from alternative applications of \nthe resources consumed in the transaction). \n \n7.  The sector approach will allow donor agencies to specialize more easily and move to \nlarger  joint-funded  projects;  introduce  programmatic  planning  processes;  increase  rates  of \nproject disbursements; consolidate training activities and make skills less donor-specific; and \nincrease  recipient  ownership  of  projects,  particularly  at  the  community  level.  The  sector \napproach is beneficial to both the Government and donor agencies, whether they favor a project \napproach or a sectorwide programmatic approach, whether they give loans or grants. \n \n8.  The SWAp approach brings Government and aid agency policies, procedures, and \npractices closer together over time, mitigating the problem of high transaction costs when so \nmany players insist on different \u201crules of the game.\u201d The ultimate goal of the process is that the \nonly  set  of  guidelines  and  regulations  becomes  those  of  the  Government,  with  donor \ninvolvement limited to ensuring that practice does not deviate from the regulations. \n \n9.  Transaction costs in Nepal will be addressed and possibly reduced by this intervention \nby addressing issues at both macro and project cycle levels. \n \n10.  At the macro level, SWAp will have the following key accomplishments: \n \n \n1.  Improve Medium Term Resource Planning by the Government \n11.  Medium-term resource planning by the Government will be improved \n \n(i)  by a planning network based on community participation that will help produce a \nmedium-term fiscal outlook, which will be the basis for a resource allocation ", "50   Appendix 12 \npolicy in the sector. SWAp will also support the approach that MOF introduced, \nnamely, rolling fiscal budgets; \n(ii)  by costed, medium-term sector expenditure programs based on defined sector \nstrategies and plans, which are currently being adopted by the Government; \n(iii)  by transforming DDC plans into rolling 5-year programs, renewed annually; and \n(iv)  by requiring agencies and provinces to submit consolidated recurrent and capital \nbudget proposals simultaneously to the DDC as the focus of central planning. \n \n2.  Ensure Support for this Process by Donors \n \n12.  Major contributors to the sector and DFID which have participated in the extensive \nconsultation process express interest in participating in the SWAp because it will  \n(i)  provide information on the level and structure of aid agency commitments and \nprogrammed disbursements over the medium-term planning horizon used by \nGovernment; \n(ii)  synchronize fixed-term country programs with the Government's 5-year planning \ncycle; and   \n(iii)  adopt medium - to long-term (5-10 years) country programs, and roll forward \ncommitments and disbursement plans on an annual basis.   \n \n3.  Improve The Quality Of Public Expenditure Information  \n \n13.  Detailed  sector  expenditure  reviews,  led  by  the  Government  with  support  from \ncontributors, will enhance the quality of public expenditure data. A midterm review of the \nintervention  will  be  written  into  the  loan  document  and  will  form  part  of  the  Government \nassurances. \n \n  4.  Improve Aid Coordination  \n \n14.  Formalizing the Stakeholder Group Committee will enhance aid coordination. \n \n(i)  The structure of working groups can be rationalized. \n(ii)  The structure of meetings can be improved. \n(iii)  Government ownership of the coordination function will increase. \n(iv)  Coordination group meetings can be synchronized with Government planning \nand budgeting cycles. \n \n15.  At the project cycle management level, key accomplishments are as follows. \n \n \n5.  Improve the Project Identification and Appraisal Process \n \n16.  The Government adopts selection criteria developed for identifying subprojects. \n(i)  Revising the project appraisal criteria will promote consistency and clarity. \n(ii)  Authority for project appraisal and approval is devolved to DDC level. \n(iii)  The community is involved in the early stages of project design and feasibility \nstudies. \n(iv)  DDC capacity for project design and appraisal is promoted. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 12  51\n6.  Ensure Support for this Process by Donors \n \n17.  Donor agencies will support this process, for it \n \n(i)  leads to coordinated country programming missions, thus reducing administration \ncosts; and \n(ii)  allows them to see whether they are engaging the Government appropriately and \nat the right level. \n \n7.   Standardize Procedures between Government and Donor Agencies \n \n18.  Standardizing procedures between the Government and aid agencies could generate \nefficiency savings, strengthen the Government's capacity to build and reinforce systems, and \nenhance  Government  ownership  of  ODA  by  ensuring  Government  leadership  in  decision \nmaking. Standardization of the project design and appraisal process will be achieved by \n \n(i)  conducting  joint  missions  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  projects,  and  joint \nmissions to identify future interventions; \n(ii)  adopting  common  forms  for  project  proposals  and  feasibility  studies,  with \nagreement on the nature and quality of information to be provided; and \n(iii)  using common appraisal criteria for projects. \n \n18.  The prospect of all Nepal aid delivery moving toward this model is a long-term one in \nthat the  macroenvironment of aid delivery and budgetary management does not yet meet \nseveral preconditions needed to embark on a fully programmatic approach.  The Government \nand ADB (with cofinancing) have moved toward this approach slightly in the education sector, \nbut it is not working effectively due to the relationship between the aid agencies and their \ninternational procedures.  \n \n19.  In the short term, however, this intervention will assist the Government to implement \nmeasures that could achieve a more programmatic approach with the potential advantage of \nincreasing aid effectiveness, although an immediate reduction in transaction costs arising from \nthese developments is not likely.  These initiatives follow \n \n(i)  bringing projects under one sectoral, or subsectoral strategy; \n(ii)  consolidating and rationalizing donor agency projects through joint funding; \n(iii)  improving the quality of aid coordination; \n(iv)  trying to get a sectoral allocation overview; \n(v)  improving public expenditure management; and \n(vi)  emphasizing Government leadership throughout, but with a community- based \napproach. \n \nC.  Assumptions on Project Costs \n20.  Due to the nature of the intervention at a sector level, the following analysis is indicative \nof the type of output made possible by the approach. Because the analysis is based on a five-\nsubproject sample it is not representative of the macro benefits arising from the intervention. \nThese benefits are difficult to quantify. The following analysis is provided to give a visible and \ntangible demonstration of the effects of the intervention.  \n ", "52   Appendix 12 \n1.  Assumptions for the Economic and Financial Analyses \n21.  The financial and economic analyses were in accordance with the ADB guidelines in the \nHandbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects, 1999. Basic assumptions used \nfor the financial analysis follow: (i) all revenues and investment costs are in constant April 2003 \nprices on an incremental basis; (ii) project investment costs are derived from estimated costs, \nless  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  and  (iii) capital expenditure are \nrecorded at the time they are incurred, while interest and depreciation are excluded. \n22.  The cost estimate of the Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project is \ncalculated based on a project period of 6 years (2004-2009) with the base cost data based on \nApril 2003 costs. An exchange rate of NRs78/$ and price contingencies of 5.7% for local \ninflation and 2.5% for foreign inflation were assumed, based on the data and guidelines in \nADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions on preparation of project cost estimates. These rates \nwere applied for the whole period from data collection (April 2003) to project completion.  \n23.  The financial and economic analyses of the Project were conducted individually for each \nof the five water supply and sanitation core subprojects selected by the end of phase 2 of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA). It is not possible at this stage of the Project to \nanticipate the relative share of each type of water supply and sanitation subprojects (piped \nwater  supply,  deep  borehole  equipped  with  hand  pumps,  drilled  wells,  etc.)  that  will  be \neffectively implemented on each qualifying province and at project level.  \n24.  For each core subproject, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated. \nKey assumptions for the economic analysis follow:  \n(i)  The economic opportunity cost of capital is 12%.  \n(ii)  The economic life of the infrastructure and the forecast period for the economic \ncost-benefit analysis is 15 years.  \n(iii)  Analysis used a domestic price level numeraire, expressed in Nepali rupees. \nTradable goods and services were converted into domestic prices by using the \nshadow exchange rate factor, which for Nepal is currently estimated to be 0.9.  \n(iv)  The conversion factor for unskilled labor was estimated at 0.70, reflecting the fact \nthat the real market price of labor in the project area is lower than the official \nwage rates, which are used in the financial cost estimates.  \n(v)  All taxes and duties were excluded from the cost estimates, and the resulting \neconomic values expressed in constant April 2003 price levels. \n25.  Quantifiable  economic  benefits  from  improved  water  supply  include  economic  cost \nsavings on nonincremental water consumption, and incremental water consumption induced by \nimproved service and quality. The economic value of non-incremental water is based on the \naverage existing economic supply price of water from existing sources and that of incremental \nwater is based on the average demand price, all expressed in economic terms in world price \nnumeraire. Resources costs savings include the cost of alternative water sources and time \nsaved in fetching water. \n26.  Table 1 presents a summary of the Average Incremental Financial Cost (AIFC), Average \nIncremental Economic Cost (AEIC), and monthly tariff per household, estimated as a proportion \nof monthly tariff in household income; EIRR; and poverty impact ratio (PIR) for each scheme \nand the average of the five schemes. AIFC for water supply and sanitation projects provides a \nmeasure of the cost per cubic meter in the proposed subprojects and the tariff needed to \nprovide for full cost recovery. AIEC is the discounted value of incremental capital costs and ", "Appendix 12  53\noperating costs (in economic prices) over the project life, divided by the discounted value of \nincremental quantity of water sales. \n27.  The estimated average EIRR for the five schemes is 68%. The EIRRs for individual \nschemes range from 24% to 94%. Para. 29 gives a qualifying explanation of the high values. \nTable 1 : Population, Number of HH, AIFC, AIEC, Monthly Tariff, EIRR, and PIR of the 5 \nSelected Schemes \n            Tariff     \n          Monthly  as % of  Base   \n    No. of  AIFC  AIEC  Tariff  Monthly  Case   \nScheme  Population  HH  (NRs)  (NRs)  Per HH  Income  EIRR(%)  PIR \nChuriyamai  1,427  234  221  215  129  1.5  87  13 \nDhap     592  92  281  279  53  0.5  24  11 \nHirminiya  1,669  313  95  125  16  0.2  94  21 \nLalpur  1,945  291  104  103  17  0.3  47  21 \nPhedayak      562  97  122  120  50  0.6  91  32 \nAverage  1,239  205  165  168  53       0.62  68  20 \nAIEC =Average Incremental Economic Cost, AIFC = Average Incremental Financial Cost, EIRR = economic internal \nrate of return, HH = households, PIR = poverty impact ratio. \n \n28.  A number of sensitivity tests were conducted to test the EIRR of each core subproject. \nSensitivity tests include 10% increase in capital cost and operation and maintenance costs, 10% \nreduction in benefits linked to water tariffs and water consumption, and 20% decrease in assets' \nlifetime. Switching values and AIEC were also calculated for each subproject using a discount \nrate of 12%. No testing was conducted for possible delays in initial investment schedule as the \nsize and type of investments considered will be completed within 1 year for each individual \nsubproject. All results were robust to the tests. \n \n29.  The estimated EIRR for the Project as a whole is about 90%. The figure is conservative, \nas it does not include benefits derived from sanitation improvements and health benefits. \n \n2.  Expected Impact of the Main Component \n30.  The rural component will, in the first instance, provide for the construction of about 1,200 \nvillage water supply systems, either piped water supply systems or collective hand pump wells. \nIt will also support the construction of individual water supply systems (hand pumps or rainwater \nsystems) through technical advice and linking the beneficiaries with formal credit systems of \nmicrofinance schemes. This is expected to increase by about 20-30% the coverage for water \nsupply in rural areas in the target area.  \n31.  A community awareness program will empower the village communities to plan and \nparticipate in subproject screening, design, and implementation. The adoption of this Project will \nin part redress historical inequities in service provision and involvement in decision making by \nwomen, poor people, and marginalized castes and ethnic minorities. The Project will support \nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage at the central level and its district departments to \nupgrade  infrastructure  planning  and  implementation  skills.  More  importantly  it  will  support \ncapacity building at DDC, VDC, the private sector, and nongovernment organizations. For the \nsanitation component, the Project will increase by about 15% the existing improved sanitation \nsystems. ", "54   Appendix 12 \n3.  Assumption of Water System Type \n32.  Agreed-upon district selection criteria were applied to all districts throughout Nepal, \nwhich  were  then  prioritized  by  giving  equal  weight  to  the  four  major  criteria  of  gender \ndevelopment index (GDI, a gender-modified version of the human development index [HDI]), \npiped water supply coverage, latrine coverage, and incidence of diarrheal disease.  \n33.  The resulting mapping showed that an approximate 70/30% split of districts most in need \nof project assistance between those in the hills and mountains, and those in the terai.  In the \nhills and mountain areas, gravity systems are the most technically viable water supply option. In \nthe terai, the great majority of sites (except a very few sites close enough to the hills where \ngravity systems might be technically feasible) will use improved hand pumps with drilled or dug \nwells. Thus, the Project construction cost estimates assume that 70% of the systems financed \nby the Project will be gravity systems, and the remaining 30% multifamily drilled wells with hand \npumps attached. Individual users  may upgrade to small electric pumps, for which they pay \n100% of the incremental cost. \n4.  Assumptions on the Realization of Economic Benefit \n34.  Subprojects will be selected according to the selection criteria designed for the use of \nthe DDC. Three key aspects will ensure that the selection criteria will focus the subproject on \nthe anticipated economic benefits:  \n(i)  The technical solution will only be chosen from the sample subproject proposals \nthat were subjected to rigorous economic analysis during the TA. All anticipated \ntechnical options provided an appropriate EIRR.  \n  (ii)  All design options will deliver a minimum of 25 liters per capita per day. This is a \nprerequisite  to  attaining  economic  benefits  as  determined  by  the  subproject \nanalysis. \n  (iii)  The design of the technical solution must meet the demand for a minimum time \nsaving, being the time required to fetch water from existing water sources. \n  5.  Affordability \n35.  The communities are aware of Government policy that, to qualify for schemes, they have \nto assume the responsibility for postconstruction operation and maintenance (O&M). In addition, \nthe  village  has  to  contribute  20%  to  the  cost  of  construction.  As  the  average  expressed \nwillingness to pay for water and sanitation in each village exceeded by far the required O&M \ncosts, it can be concluded that the overall Project is in principle sustainable. \n6.  Poverty Impact \n36.  The selection of subprojects for appraisal during the TA was compromised by the \nsecurity situation at the time the sites were chosen (before the current cease-fire between the \nGovernment and the Maoists), and it was strongly advised that sites relatively near road heads \nbe chosen that did not necessarily reflect the UNDP HDI initial selection criterion to focus on \npoorer districts. The net result was that while one of the communities was relatively poor, the \nothers were not as poor. Thus the PIR shown in Table 1 is not likely to be representative of the \nkinds of communities that will actually be supported by the Project.  ", "Appendix 12  55\n7.  Maximum Allowable Subproject Capital Cost Work Sheet  \n37.  A basic calculation that provides a maximum justifiable construction cost is required for \neach subproject.

Introduction \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) of the proposed Project was carried out to \nidentify necessary measures to prevent or mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that \ncould possibly arise from its implementation. IEEs of five sample subprojects1 were undertaken \nduring the course of the project preparatory technical assistance (TA). The Project is classified \nas environmental category B. The IEE study was prepared in accordance with the Government \nof  Nepal's  environmental  legislation  and  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  environmental \nassessment and requirements. The study is based on the TA, comprehensive reports by \nrelevant Government agencies, research institutions, and ADB Mission findings.  \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project, developed as a sector loan under the framework of the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction focus in the 10th National Plan, will provide rural water supply and sanitation \n(RWSS) facilities and services to improve community health and provide opportunities for \nincome generation to about 1,200 communities in 21 districts. It will also facilitate the building of \ninstitutional capacity of local government institutions district development committees, village \ndevelopment committees reflecting the Government\u2019s commitment to decentralized decision \nmaking by focusing mi plementation on the district level. With its strong community-based \napproach, the Project will help rectify historical inequities in providing RWSS services to remote \ndistricts, and will focus on service provision to previously underserved communities and families \nwithin those communities whose access to RWSS was limited due to gender, caste, or ethnicity. \n \n3.  The  Project  has  a  RWSS  component  (the  rural  component  and  an  institutional \nstrengthening  component).  The  rural  component  will  include  community  mobilization  and \ncapacity  building  for  sustainability;  construction  of  community  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities; health and hygiene program and gender, caste, and ethnic minority program. The \ninstitutional component will  (i) look at strengthening the capacity of DDCs to provide water \nsupply and sanitation services, and (ii) support the decentralization policy and the Department \nof Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) Central Planning and Monitoring Unit in its new role as \nfacilitator of RWSS. \nC.

Water supply systems \nfacilities include (i) gravity pipe system, (ii) groundwater tube well, (iii) rainwater harvesting, and \n(iv) groundwater wells with hand pumps. Sanitation facilities include (i) simple pit latrines, (ii) \npour-flush latrines, and (iii) cistern flush latrines. Not one of these schemes is associated with \npotentially significant adverse environmental impacts as they are small and environmental \nfactors will be taken into account from the planning and design stages. However, minor and \nlocalized environmental impacts and risk may occur and could reduce the benefits.  These \nimpacts  include  inadequate  drainage  (stagnant  pools  of  water  becoming  the  habitat  of \nmosquitoes  and  other  disease  vectors);  pollution  of  source  water  or  during  transmission, \ndistribution, or in-house storage due to improper water management; source disputes with \nexisting or prospective water users; damage to the system or disruption of the supply due to \nfloods, landslides, animals; and water source depletion from overuse.  These environmental \nimpacts are localized any potential negative impacts by improper siting, cumulative effects, and \ninadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures of the systems will be managed \nthrough the Project\u2019s environmental assessment and monitoring procedures. Environmental \ncriteria for selecting the subprojects are set out in the table. These environmental criteria as well \nas an Environmental Screening Procedure and Checklist for Scheme Appraisal will be attached \nto the loan agreement with the Government of Nepal and to the Project agreements between \nthe  Executing  Agency,  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  and  the  DDCs  and  the \nparticipating community.   \nc.  Health and Hygiene Program \n6.  This  activity  will  involve  environmentally  harmless  activities  intended  to  raise \ncommunities awareness of health and hygiene issues related to water supply and sanitation. \nd.  Gender, Caste, and Ethnic Minority Program \n7.  A program to increase the active participation of disadvantaged groups and women in all \nactivities of the WUGs and water user and sanitation committee through training and awareness \nprograms will be implemented. \n2.  The Institutional Strengthening Component \n8.  This component will provide training and technical support to participating DDCs to allow \nthem to plan, manage, monitor, and evaluate community-based RWSS. This component will \nalso provide TA to DWSS to carry out its new role as facilitator of RWSS. Though these \nactivities will not have any environmental impacts, the DDCs as well as DWSS will be made \naware of and will be trained on environmental issues related to RWSS to ensure that technical \nguidelines and standards take into account environmental concerns. \n \nD.  Environmental Review Procedure \n \n1.  Nepal\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n \n9.  The Environmental Protection Act 2053 (1996) and the Environmental Protection Rules \n(EPR) 2054 (1997), revised in 2055 (1999) and supported by acts such as the Forest Act, \nNational Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, and the Local Self-Governance Act, provide the \nbasic legal framework for environmental appraisal in Nepal.  According to EPR criteria, RWSS \nschemes do not require a formal environmental appraisal except for certain criteria such as \nnumber of people being served; need for resettlement if any; diversion of water from a surface ", "58 Appendix 13 \nsource; capacity of water treatment plant; etc. In these cases, an IEE or an environmental \nimpact  assessment  will  be  required.  Where  no  IEE  is  required,  an  environmental \nscreening/appraisal of the schemes will be carried out. An environmental screening procedure \nand an environmental checklist for scheme appraisal have been drawn up and will be attached \nto the Project Agreement between DDC and the community.  \n2.  Environmental Procedures to Be Used for Scheme Appraisal \n10.  When a community is ready to select its scheme and start planning, with the assistance \nof the contracted nongovernment organization/community-based organization (NGO/CBO) the \nWUSC  will  fill  out  the  environmental  checklist  for  scheme  appraisal  and  complete  an \nenvironmental brief. This will be done in a participatory manner as scheme selection involves all \nWUGs. The documents will be submitted with the scheme application to the DDC. The DDC, \nwith assistance initially from the WSST, will carry out the environmental screening procedure2 \nfor potential environmental impacts and compliance with formal requirements.3  \n \n11.  In addition to the technical supervision during planning, design, and construction of the \nschemes by the NGOs/CBOs, the DDC technical officer with the assistance of the WSST will \nregularly monitor activities during each phase of the scheme (planning, design, construction, \nO&M) to ensure that environmental concerns are being addressed and appropriate mitigation \nmeasures are in place.  \n \n12.  DWSS will commission two independent assessments of environmental performance \nduring  the  project  period  by  random  sampling  of  project  schemes  and  will  focus  on  (i) \ncompliance with environmental screening and related requirements; (ii) use of environmental \nguidelines  for  planning  and  development;  (iii)  satisfactory  monitoring  by  the  DDC;  (iv) \nsatisfactory support, supervision, and guidance by NGOs/CBOs; (v) general level of project \nenvironmental performance; (vi) O&M status of constructed facilities;  and  (vii) water quality \ntesting of sample schemes with cross-checking of water quality test carried out by the DDC. The \nresults of these assessments will be sent to ADB for review.  During its review missions, ADB \nwill also assess environmental compliance of the DDC and communities.  \n3.  Conformity  of  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  with \nADB\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n13.  The environmental assessment and review procedures have been reviewed and found \nto be satisfactory and in conformity with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies.  \nSpecific evaluations will be carried out throughout the project life to ensure that the guidelines \nare adhered to and that adequate training is given to DDC and DWSS staff carrying out the \nassessment and to the communities receiving the services.  \n                                                 \n2  The screening includes siting, execution, and O&M considerations. The results are then fed into a matrix and \nmitigation measures are developed for each indicated impact. Costs and responsibilities are then assigned. The \ncost of the identified environmental mitigation measures will be included in the schemes\u2019 costs, and their \nimplementation will be monitored.  \n3  An IEE methodology and procedure has been developed for RWSS and is included in Supplementary Appendix A. ", "  \nSUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA \n \nProject Activity  Special Specifications \n \nAn environmental appraisal and project brief will be prepared by the water user and sanitation committees and submitted to the district development committees \n(DDC) after which the DDC will carry out environmental screening. Environmental screening will specify how the impacts will be minimized by approaching the \nactivities and practices in an environmentally sensitive manner. All subprojects will ensure active participation of women, excluded castes, and ethnic minority groups \nas set in the gender, caste, and ethnic minority program. No scheme will have a negative impact on these groups.  \nWater Supply Schemes \n   \nThe source should be assessed and an agreement in writing drawn up for water use by all  The community mobilization activity will ensure that all concerned \nusers (community, farmers, etc.).  parties are consulted and agreement is reached on the use of the \nsource. \nThe scheme will not be located in the premises of cultural sites.  If this is absolutely not possible, approval in writing from the concerned \ncommunity or relevant Government agency needs to be sought. \nSchemes will not be located within protected and forest areas.       Should a component of the scheme need to pass by a protected or \nforest area, approval in writing will be sought from the Protected Area \nAuthority and the community forest user groups. \nScheme components will not be located on steep slopes, landslide areas, moist areas, and  Measures will be developed with the assistance of nongovernment \nloess deposit areas.  organizations and the district development committees (DDC). These \ncan include ditches to divert runoff away from source, fencing off the \nsource to control entry of animals, providing separate washing facilities \nsufficiently far from the water source, etc. \nAfter selecting the source, the WUG will develop measures to prevent pollution of the water  The DDC will ensure that these activities take place if the source is \nsource and the system as a whole  located  on  these  slopes.
