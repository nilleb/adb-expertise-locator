It will address key water resources management and related issues in Zuoquan \nCounty  in  an  integrated  manner,  including  flood  mitigation,  soil  erosion  prevention,  land  use \nplanning, water supply, wastewater treatment, and related capacity-building activities.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nRapid economic development in the PRC has led to severe ecological and environmental \ndegradation.  To  address  these  issues  while  continuing  to  eliminate  absolute  poverty,  the \nGovernment of the PRC has been promoting ecological civilization2 and has specified targets in \nits Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.3 Water \nresources  protection  and  flood  risk  mitigation  are  key  elements  of  ecological  civilization  and \neffective means for poverty reduction. The government has identified Zuoquan County, a national-\nlevel poverty county in the water-scarce and heavily polluted Hai River basin, as an integral part \nof  the  ecological  belt  for  Shanxi  Province.  Assistance  to  Zuoquan  County  is  expected  to \ndemonstrate the ability and merits of working at  the county level to advance the government\u2019s \ngoal of ecological civilization and poverty reduction. \n \n4. \nZuoquan County is in the Hai River basin, bordering Hebei Province on the east. It has a \npopulation of 165,042 (in 2015), 57% of which is rural. The county\u2019s mean annual precipitation is \n520 millimeters, with more than 70% of rainfall occurring from June to September; and its average \nannual evaporation is 1,620 millimeters. With 33% of its population being poor, Zuoquan County \nis designated a national-level poverty county. About 98% of Zuoquan County is in the Qingzhang \nwatershed. Originating in the county, the Qingzhang River flows into the Zhang River in Hebei \nProvince\u2014a  tributary  of  the  Hai  River.  The  Qingzhang  River,  together  with  the  Shixia  and \nXiajiaozhang reservoirs, is a strategic water source for 1.92 million people in Shanxi Province. As \nan  important  source  for  the  Hai  River  basin,  the  water  quality  of  Qingzhang  River  also  bears \nsignificantly on the water safety of 1.2 million people in downstream areas of Hebei and Henan \nprovinces. \n \n5. \nSoil  erosion  and  sedimentation.  Located  on  the  Loess  Plateau,  Zuoquan  County \nexperiences serious soil erosion, with over 50% of its land eroded to some degree. The vegetation \ncoverage  of  the  Qingzhang  River\u2019s  upstream  catchment  is  generally  good,  but  the  vegetation \ncondition for areas near villages and towns and along the roads is poor. Heavy rain has caused \nsoil erosion from these areas with little or without coverage. Soil erosion also comes from non-\nprotected riverbanks. Sediment from soil erosion has resulted in the siltation of rivers, streams, \n\n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Shanxi \n\nUrban\u2013Rural Water Source Protection and Environmental Demonstration Project (TA 8856-PRC). \n\n2  Ecological  civilization  refers  to  achieving  harmony  between  growth,  people,  and  nature.  It  includes  activities  to \nmitigate  ecological  damage,  relieve  pressures  on  natural  resources,  and  improve  the  balance  between  the \nenvironment and the economy. \n\n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social \n\nDevelopment. Beijing. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand reservoirs. According to the record of the Zuoquan Shixia Reservoir Management Office from \n1990 to 2013, the total accumulated siltation volume during these 23 years was 345,000 cubic \nmeters  (m3),  with  an  average  siltation  volume  of  15,000  m3 per  year.  Siltation  of  the  reservoir \ncompromises its flood control function and reduces the water storage capacity. Soil erosion also \nimpairs other vital ecosystem services. Projected increases in storm intensities will likely increase \nthe risk of soil erosion. \n \n6. \nFlood risks. Zuoquan County suffers from frequent floods because of lack of adequate \ninfrastructure. Riverine floods occur in most sections of the Qingzhang River at a flood frequency \nof one in 5 years. The main urban section contains a structural embankment whereas rural areas \nonly have isolated earth bunds. Bank protection for both sides of the river in the west district (a \nnew  city  district  under  development)  is  almost  nonexistent\u2014a  few  earth  bunds  built  from  the \n1950s to the 1980s are in dilapidated conditions, and some have been washed down to the river, \ncausing  severe  blockages.  Flood  risks  are  heightened  by  the  projected  increase  in  climate-\ninduced  storm  intensities.  A  major  flood  in  August  1996  caused  huge  losses,  affecting  about \n100,000 people in all 10 townships of Zuoquan County. About 9,000 houses were destroyed, and \nnearly  140,000  mu  of  cropland  were  damaged.4 The  flood  caused  more  than  30 deaths  and \n550 injuries.  Flooding  not  only  poses  a  significant  risk  to  people\u2019s  lives,  but  is  also  a  key \nrestraining factor of sustainable development in Zuoquan County. \n \nLow quality and inadequate water supply. The separate planning process and different \n7. \nownership  structures  for  water  management  in  Zuoquan  County  have  resulted  in  serious \ndevelopment  gaps  in  water  supply  facilities.  Zuoquan  County  has  functioning  water  supply \nfacilities for its 60,000 residents in the county\u2019s urban center. However, the water supply to rural \nresidents  is  lacking  or  of  poor  quality,  without  any  treatment.  The  water  supply  pipes  are  also \naged and leaking. Further, though they have permits to withdraw water from the Shixia Reservoir, \nmost rural enterprises use groundwater without adequate infrastructure to access surface water, \nresulting in the depletion and unsustainable use of groundwater. These rural enterprises, which \nhire over 90% of local villagers, are an important income source for rural farmers. Inequitable and \nunsafe  water  supply  is  inconsistent  with  socially  inclusive  development,  and  hinders  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of urban\u2013rural integration. \n \nInsufficient  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  The  wastewater  collection  and \n8. \ntreatment capacity in Zuoquan County cannot meet the demand of increasing urbanization. Like \nelsewhere in the PRC, urbanization has been a key driver of development and economic growth. \nHowever,  continuous  rapid  urbanization  puts  significant  pressure  on  scarce  land  and  natural \nresources, and contributes to pollution for Zuoquan County. Some sewer networks are aged and \nleaking, causing pollution to the Qingzhang River. Key issues include (i) wastewater overflowing \nfrom some flow interceptors into the Qingzhang River, even in the dry season; (ii) the trunk sewer \nleaking  directly  into  the Qingzhang  River,  as  it  is  laid  along  the  river; (iii)  the Zuoquan  County \nwastewater  treatment  plant  facing  frequent  equipment  breakdowns;  and  (iv)  the  capacities  of \nwastewater collection and treatment being unable to meet current and future needs. \n \nLack of ecosystem-friendly infrastructure connecting urban center and new district. \n9. \nZuoquan  County\u2019s  urban  development  master  plan  expected  the  urban  population  to  grow  to \nabout 82,000 in 2020 and 113,000 in 2030.5 The urbanization rate is projected to increase to 62% \nin 2030. The existing Binhe Road, a trunk road connecting the urban center to the new district in \nperi-urban and rural areas, cannot satisfy current and increasing traffic demands. The east section \n\n                                                \n4  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n5  Zuoquan County Government. 2011. Zuoquan Urban Development Master Plan, 2011\u20132030. Zuoquan. \n\n\fof the Binhe Road has reached its design capacity, while the west section of about 5 kilometers \n(km) is yet to be expanded to meet the demand. Moreover, the storm water pipe and the trunk \nsewer to the new district need to be installed concurrently along the Binhe Road\u2014as an integrated \napproach to improving water resources management together with road improvement\u2014which will \nbe cheaper than constructing them separately. The Binhe Road provides an opportunity to pilot \ntest the government\u2019s sponge city initiative, which will not only help slow down surface runoff but \nalso reduce nonpoint source pollution from urban runoff.6 The experience gained will be used for \nZuoquan County\u2019s new urban district development. \n \n10.  Weak  institutional  capacity.  Zuoquan  County\u2019s  water  resources  management  is \nfragmented, lacking a coordinated and integrated approach to land use planning, and urban and \nrural development. The urban and rural water supply systems are separate, with large gaps in \nwater  quality  and  service  reliability.  Zuoquan  County\u2019s  capacity  for  project  planning  and \nimplementation  is  weak  since  it  has  little  experience  with  international  organizations.  The \ncounterpart staff of the project do not have experience in implementing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  projects  and  are  unfamiliar  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements.  The  current  flood-\nwarning  system  is  inadequate,  and  cannot  provide  effective  and  timely  warnings  to  rural \ncommunities. \n \n11. \nStrategic fit. The project is aligned with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development,  2016\u20132020  for  integrated  urban\u2013rural  development  and \necological civilization (footnote 3). It is also consistent with Zuoquan County\u2019s urban development \nmaster plan (footnote 5). The project conforms to the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020;7 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 \nfor managing climate change and the environment, and supporting inclusive economic growth.8 \nIt also conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 to increase coverage and improve \nservices for water supply and sanitation, and promote integrated water resources management.9 \n \nLessons. The project design has incorporated lessons from good practices in integrated \n12. \nwater resources management financed by ADB and other international development agencies. \nMajor lessons include (i) an integrated management approach, incorporating cross-sector water \nresources  management,  urbanization,  and  environmental  issues  (including  projected  climate \nchange  impacts);  (ii)  the  inclusion  of  nonstructural  measures  and  community  participation  in \naddition  to  structural  interventions;  (iii)  coordinated  management  of  urban\u2013rural  planning,  and \nmanagement of resources and services to facilitate integration and linkage to infrastructure; and \n(iv) provision of training to strengthen government agencies. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  quality  of  life  and  environmental \nsustainability  in  Zuoquan  County  improved  (footnote  5).10 The  project  will  have  the  following \n\n                                                \n6  The sponge city initiative is the government\u2019s policy to promote water conservation. A key principle is to minimize the \nimpact of urban development on the natural water cycle through green infrastructure such as preserved floodplains, \nstorm water wetlands, retention ponds, sunken parks, bio-retention swales, seepage wells, and green roofs. \n\n7  ADB. 2014.

The  project  is  expected  to  demonstrate  the \nfollowing  innovations  and/or  value  additions,  which  will  be  disseminated  through  knowledge \nproducts, water conferences, and exchange visits with similar river basins: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nIntegrated water resources management at county level. The project supports \nstructural and nonstructural measures from upstream to downstream Qingzhang \nRiver, including climate-resilient flood risk management, ecological conservation \nand  rehabilitation,  water  demand  management,  and  institutional  reform.  This \napproach  will  have  a  good  demonstration  effect  for  other  regions,  as  the  PRC \nneeds to improve the management of its many small river basins. \n\n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIntegrated urban\u2013rural land use planning and protection. The project area has \nbeen analyzed and classified into different zones according to their land use types. \nProtection measures have been identified according to the characteristics of each \nland  use  zone,  including  climate-sensitive  vegetation  for  upstream  Shixia \nReservoir  to  reduce  soil  erosion  and  adapt  to  anticipated  increase  in  extreme \nweather events; improvement of the flood protection standard of the Qingzhang \nRiver; improvement of sewage collection and treatment; and provision of reliable \nand quality water supply to rural households and rural industry. \nApplication  of  sponge  city  design.  Sponge  city  is  an  important  concept  for \nintegrated  urban  land  and  water  management  (footnote  6).  Climate  resilience \nplanning  and  design  practices  embedded  in  the  sponge  city  concept  are \ndemonstrated in the Binhe Road expansion. The scale will be extended to prepare \nan  action  plan  to  identify  technologies  and  practices for  Zuoquan  County\u2019s  new \nurban district development. \nInclusive  urbanization  and  poverty  reduction.  Zuoquan,  a  national  poverty \ncounty, is below average in social and economic development partly because of \ninadequate infrastructure. The project will create an enabling environment for the \ncounty\u2019s development and poverty reduction by providing improved infrastructure, \nflood  risk  reduction  measures,  water  supply,  and  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment system. \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n20. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $152.1  million  (Table  1).

The \ntechnical  feasibility  was  confirmed  to  be  adequate  after  detailed  examination  of  the  project\u2019s \ncompatibility with local conditions, including current and projected climate variables, availability of \nwater sources, and land available for project facilities. Alternative technical options identified the \nmost  suitable  sites  for  the  facilities  and  different  forms  of  river  embankments  to  suit  the  local \nenvironment. The processes selected for water supply and wastewater treatment are appropriate \nfor the technical capacity of the local implementing agencies.  \n \n25. \nClimate  change.  A  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  indicated  that  the  project \ninfrastructure is at moderate to high risk of adverse climate change impact. Water components \n(outputs 2 and 3) are at moderate risk from greater variability in precipitation, rising temperatures, \nand/or increased storm intensity. Ecosystems and natural resources components (output 1 and \npart of output 2) are rated high risk because of the strong likelihood of physiological stress from \nrising  temperatures  and  increased  probability  of  heatwaves  in  summer,  leading  to  increased \nmortality rates, loss of biodiversity, and reduced productivity and provision of ecosystem services. \nThe  overall  design  is  geared  toward  climate  resilience.  Each  project  component  incorporates \nadaptation  measures,  including  raising  embankment  heights  and  increasing  reservoir  storage \ncapacity to cope with climate-induced flooding; adopting a mix of climate-resilient native species \nfor  the  revegetation  and  forest  planting  components;  enhanced  hydrological  and  water  quality \nmonitoring;  and  capacity  building  on  water resources  management that  is mindful  of projected \nclimate risks. The project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emission by 640 tons per year. \nClimate mitigation is estimated to cost $3.25 million and climate adaptation is estimated to cost \n$18.52 million.13 ADB will finance 93% of mitigation and adaptation costs. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nThe economic analysis confirmed the economic viability of the project, with an economic \ninternal rate of return of 17.9%. The economic viability of the project was tested against different \nadverse  scenarios:  a  10%  investment  cost  overrun,  a  10%  increase  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance cost, a 10% reduction in benefits, and their combinations. The results showed that \nthe economic viability of the project is robust against any of the adverse scenarios. \n \n27. \nThe  financial  analysis  assessed  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  based  on  the \nfiscal impact of (i) counterpart funds during the project, (ii) operation and maintenance cost, and \n(iii)  the  loan  repayment  obligation.  ZCG  will  be  responsible  for  the  entire  financial  obligations. \nDuring implementation, the total financial obligations represent up to 4.2% of the annual revenue \nof ZCG. After project implementation, ADB\u2019s loan repayment, financing charges, and recurrent \ncosts will be about 1.9% of the annual revenue of ZCG. The project is fiscal sustainable based on \nthe  projected  fiscal  analysis  of  ZCG\u2019s  revenues  and  expenditures,  as  well  as  a  water  sector \ncomponent analysis showing a financial internal rate of return exceeding the weighted average \ncost of capital. \n \n\n                                                \n13 Details  on  the  estimates  of  climate  risk  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  can  be  found  in  the  Climate  Risk \n\nVulnerability Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked document in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nA financial management assessment was conducted for ZCG. The financial management \nrisk  of  the  project  is  moderate  because  of  ZCG\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedures  and  requirements,  or ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements.  The  assessment \nrecommended  an  action  plan,  which  ZCG  will  implement  during  the  project,  to  mitigate  the \nidentified financial management risks of unfamiliarity with ADB procedures and requirements, and \ndelays in providing adequate counterpart funds. \n \n29. \nThe procurement risk assessment indicated that (i) ZCG and the implementing agencies \nhave  the  experience  to undertake  procurement  of  consulting  services,  goods,  and  works;  and \n(ii) monitoring and internal controls regarding procurement are generally in place, but ZCG and \nthe implementing agencies lack experience on foreign-funded projects. Mitigation measures will \ninclude (i) early engagement of a procurement agent and project implementation consultants, and \n(ii) the provision of training on ADB\u2019s procurement policies and procedures during implementation. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith the government, SPG, JMG, and ZCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n31. \nPoverty  and  social.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  was  conducted;  and  several \nmeasures are adopted in the project design for social inclusion and improving living standards of \nlocal  residents,  including  (i)  the  project  area  covering  rural  villages  for  tree  plantation,  flood \nprotection  and  environmental  improvement,  and  water  supply;  (ii)  the  involvement  of  local \ncommunities  in  project  design  and  implementation;  and  (iii)  targeted  jobs  for  local  people, \nespecially for the poor and the women. \n \n32. \nA total of 98,627 people will directly benefit from the project. Among them, 58% are in rural \nvillages  and  townships,  and  11%  are  below  the  national  poverty  line.  The  project  will  provide \nseveral opportunities for local beneficiaries, including (i) new job opportunities during construction \nand operation; (ii) improved living conditions through rural water supply, wastewater management, \nand reduced flood risks; (iii) economic opportunities boosted by better environmental and water \nsecurity; (iv) improved road and traffic safety; and (v) training and capacity building. \n \nConsultations  were  undertaken  with  local  communities  during  project  preparation,  and \n33. \ntheir  feedback  has  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Further  consultations  will  be \nundertaken during the detailed design and implementation, ensuring that local people participate \nin  and  benefit  from  relevant  project  activities.  Community-based  methods  will  be  adopted  to \nimplement  nonstructural  activities.  A  stakeholder  communication  strategy  is  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 12). \n \n34. \nGender.  Most  project  benefits  are  expected  to be  distributed  across men  and  women. \nSome  components,  such  as  the  rural  water  supply  and  nonstructural  activities,  offer  more \nopportunities  for  women  and  the  poor  to  benefit.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender \nmainstreaming, and a gender action plan has been prepared. The gender and social development \naction plans comprise targeted measures for women and the poor, including (i) involving them in \nproject design and implementation, (ii) providing targeted employment for them, and (iii) training \nproject  staff  on  gender  and  social  inclusion  measures.  ZCG  will  implement  and  monitor  these \nplans, and submit semiannual progress reports to ADB. \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n35. \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \n36. \nEnvironment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) report, including \nan  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  has  been  prepared  and  follows  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.15 The IEE and EMP are based on the approved domestic feasibility study report \nand environmental assessments, site visits, and stakeholder consultations, including with affected \npersons. The outcomes have been integrated in the project design. ZCG will be responsible for \nthe  EMP  implementation;  and  will  appoint qualified  environmental  personnel  to coordinate key \ntasks, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. \nLoan implementation consultants and a capacity-building program were included in the project \ndesign. The IEE, including the EMP, was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2016. \n \n37. \nThe project is expected to achieve environmental benefits, including reduced flood risks, \nimproved security of drinking water supply for 43 villages, enhanced wastewater management, \nand revegetation in the upper west Qingzhang watershed. Anticipated construction impacts are \nfrom the dredging and embankment (i.e., temporary damage of in-channel habitats and elevated \nturbidity); and construction-related air, dust, noise, and erosion impacts. Operational risks include \ninadequate maintenance of project structures, noise emissions from increased road traffic, and \noverflow  of  untreated  wastewater  in  waterways  during  peak  floods.  Mitigation  measures  are \ndescribed  in  the  EMP;  and  include  containment  of  dredged  sediment,  design  of  embankment \nhabitats,  noise  barriers,  and  improved  storm  water  and  wastewater  management.  The  IEE \nconcludes that effective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in \nresidual impacts within the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  will  permanently  acquire \n1,049.65 mu of collective land in 33 villages and demolish 8,099.62 square meters of residential \nhousing,  involving  591  affected  households  with  1,384  affected  persons.  Among  these, \n24 households  with  104  persons  and  four  enterprises  with  32  employees  will  be  physically \ndisplaced or relocated. The project will temporarily occupy 231.00 mu of collective land during \nconstruction, and will lease 384.64 mu of village lands for planting trees. \n \n39. \nA  draft  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, and related PRC laws and regulations. Resettlement impacts have been adequately \nassessed, which includes adequate compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation measures to \nmitigate social risks and restore the living standards of affected persons. The resettlement plan \nhas been disclosed in affected villages and was posted on ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2016. \nThe affected persons were consulted during the preparation of the resettlement plan and will be \nfurther consulted during the updating and implementing of the resettlement plan. ZCG will fully \nfinance the land acquisition and resettlement costs; and the ADB loan will finance the costs for \nconsultants  for  resettlement  implementation  support  and  external  monitoring.  ZCG  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  and  experience  to  implement  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement under domestic projects. The project will strengthen their capacity to implement the \nresettlement plan in line with ADB\u2019s requirements. ZCG will engage an external monitoring agency \nto monitor the resettlement implementation and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n                                                \n14  ADB.
