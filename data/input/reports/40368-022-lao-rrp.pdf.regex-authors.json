I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram loan, and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) for the Secondary Education Sector Development Program.1 \n \n2.  The program loan will support key policy reform actions focused on strengthening the \nsecondary education subsector (SES)2 throughout the Lao PDR, and the project grant will \nfinance investments that directly link to, and support delivery of, those policy actions and ensure \nthey are effectively put into operation. Complementary program and project components will \ncollectively  address  key  priorities  related  to  equitable  access,  quality  and  relevance,  and \nsubsector management in the SES. The program will principally be national in scope, with \naccess-related project investments targeted to selected disadvantaged and underserved areas.3  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Government of the Lao PDR ascribes a high priority to education as a prerequisite \nfor  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. 4  Government  and  international \ndevelopment  partner  (IDP)  efforts  have  focused  on  the  primary  level  (grades  1\u20135),  and \nsignificant progress has been made. Gains have also been made in the SES, with the transition \nto a 7-year system marking a key milestone.5 At the same time, key gaps in access, quality and \nrelevance, and subsector management undermine the contributions made by the SES and the \nentire education system to modernization, equity and inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and \nbroader socioeconomic development in the Lao PDR. \n \n4.  Access. As primary education has expanded, the SES has become a key bottleneck. \nFrom SY2006/07 to SY2009/10, the lower secondary education (LSE) gross enrolment ratio \n(GER) rose from 53.3% to 60.2%, with the upper secondary education (USE) GER stagnant at \n34.0%.6 Aggregate figures conceal large socioeconomic and geographic gaps.7 Particularly in \npoor, rural, and largely ethnic group areas, enrolment rates decline steadily and gender gaps \nwiden at higher grades. Expanding access requires policies and investments to address an \narray of demand-side issues (e.g., financial and opportunity costs, language and other cultural \nfactors, and disabilities) and supply-side factors (e.g., weak school network coverage of remote \nareas, and inadequate financial and human resources), as well as quality issues. \n \n5.  Quality. Low SES enrolment and high rates of repetition and especially dropout partly \nreflect quality gaps.8 Particularly for LSE, rapid rises in the number of primary school graduates \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The SES comprises lower and upper secondary education. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Concept Paper \nfor Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Basic Education Sector Development Program II. Manila. \n4  Government strategies, indicators, and analysis of progress and challenges in the education sector are detailed in \nSector Assessment: Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  Completed during school years (SY) 2009/10 and SY2010/11, the extension of lower secondary education (LSE) \nby the Ministry of Education (MOE) from 3 years to 4 years and the subsequent addition of upper secondary \neducation (USE) grade 12 aligns the Lao PDR's system of primary education (5 years), LSE (4 years), and USE (3 \nyears) with the international standard of 12 years of primary and secondary schooling. \n6  The GER fell slightly in SY2009/10, despite a large rise in total enrolment, due to the extension of LSE to 4 years. \n7  For example, in SY2009/10, GERs in LSE were 44.4% for girls and 56.1% for boys in the poorest districts.  \n8  The national LSE dropout rate was 13% in SY2009/10 and is much higher in many poor and ethnic areas. In seven \nof the poorest provinces only 11%\u201325% of children are expected to reach and complete grade 11. \n ", "2 \nand limited resourcing have strained capacities to provide access to good quality education. As \npart of comprehensive SES reforms, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has developed new LSE \nand USE curricula and new LSE textbooks and teacher guides, and commenced the cohort-\nbased phase-in of the new SES curriculum in SY2010/11. Follow-on policy and investment \nsupport will be critical for these reforms to become fully operational and to realize gains from \n(and meet challenges linked to) the addition of a fourth year of LSE in SY2009/10, and the \npotential  of  new  SES  curricula  to  better  feed  in  to  subsequent  learning  and  employment. \nPriorities include bolstering (i) systems and institutions providing pre- and in-service training and \nsupport to SES teachers;9 (ii) mechanisms for teacher deployment to poor, rural, and largely \nethnic group areas (particularly in subjects such as science and math); and (iii) investment in \nfacilities and teaching and learning materials (including textbooks and laboratory facilities). \n \n6.  Subsector management. Interlinked with access and quality issues, gaps in subsector \nmanagement undermine learning outcomes and the internal and external efficiency of the SES. \nLow investment poses an overarching issue for the education sector, and the SES is particularly \nunderresourced,  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  the  only  IDP  providing \ncomprehensive support.10 Financing gaps compound other urgent SES management challenges: \n(i) institutional capacity, including the need for further rationalization alongside decentralization; \n(ii) human resources and technical and managerial capacities; (iii) planning and budgeting, as \nwell as management information systems; (iv) assessment of teachers and of student learning \noutcomes, and broader quality control; and (v) enhanced mobilization of private sector actors. \n \n7.  Sector  development  program  approach.  The  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Framework (ESDF) provides (i) a plan with which to operationalize the National \nEducation System Reform Strategy 2006\u20132015, and (ii) a unified framework for government and \nIDP efforts. Dialogue toward ADB\u2019s next country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR has \nidentified education as a core sector, and the government has called on ADB to maintain its role \nas the lead IDP supporting the SES. The program will build on, consolidate, and advance key \nSES reforms catalyzed with support under the ongoing Basic Education Sector Development \nProgram  (BESDP),  which  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  the  sector  development  program \nmodality.11 In particular, the program will seamlessly dovetail with BESDP support for curriculum \nreform, assisting the MOE to complete the introduction of the new 4-year LSE curriculum by \nSY2013/14 and in all three USE grades by SY2016/17. Comprehensive program and project \nsupport will also build on lessons, models, and capacities built under the BESDP to advance \nprogress in the SES under all three ESDF pillars: (i) assuring equitable access, (ii) improving \nquality and relevance, and (iii) strengthening sector governance and performance management. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the program will be improved educational attainment in the Lao PDR. The \noutcome will be enhanced equity, quality, and efficiency of secondary education in the Lao \nPDR.12 While the program and project components will principally be national in scope, project \ninvestments to expand access will be targeted to 30 selected districts (para. 19).  \n                                                \n9  This includes lack of a clear policy on information and communication technology (ICT) for education, in particular \nfor equity-enhancing and sustainable investments in low-cost ICT to improve teaching and pedagogical support. \n10 Rising national investment in recent years has been partly offset by declining IDP investment for education. The \nshare of the national budget allocated to education increased from a trough of below 12.0% in FY2005 to 15.5% in \nFY2010 but remains below the 18.0% level stated in the Education Law (revised in 2007). \n11 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Basic Education Sector Development Program. Manila. The program \nwill also link to proposed technical assistance to support education reforms, included in ADB\u2019s 2012 pipeline. \n12 Key targets include raising the share of female primary school graduates entering LSE (Appendix 1). \n ", "3 \n C.  Outputs \n9.  Directly aligned with the Lao PDR\u2019s ongoing SES reform agenda and the ESDF\u2019s three \npillars, the program\u2019s outputs will be (i) expanded access to secondary education, (ii) improved \ndelivery of new SES curricula, and (iii) strengthened SES management. \n \n1.  Program Outputs \n \n10.  Key policy actions supported under the program are outlined in paras. 11\u201317, with \ndetails provided in the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \na.  Expanded Access to Secondary Education \n \n11.  Stipends for disadvantaged students. The MOE has put a high priority on launching \nand expanding needs-based LSE and USE stipends.13 The program and project will support \ndevelopment and demonstration of modalities to ensure efficacy and targeting to disadvantaged \nstudents. The policy matrix includes sequenced policy actions for development and approval of \nbeneficiary selection criteria and interim implementation guidelines (including targets for girls \nand ethnic students) for MOE-administered stipends at all post-primary levels, followed by \nresourcing and launch of an expanded SES stipend program for disadvantaged students. \n \n12.  Dormitories to enhance equitable access. The MOE recognizes dormitories as a key \ninstrument for addressing constraints on access, particularly for girls and ethnic group children \nin remote villages located far from secondary schools. At the same time, despite increasing \ninvestments,  there  is  no  concrete  policy  for  dormitories  in  the  SES.  Complemented  by \ninterventions under the project component, the program will support the MOE\u2019s completion of a \nreview of existing dormitories and their impact on equitable access in the SES, followed by \nadoption of a related policy on, and guidelines for, dormitories in the subsector. \n \nb.  Improved Delivery of New Secondary Education Subsector Curricula \n \n13.  Preservice teacher training, recruitment, deployment, and utilization planning. The \nprogram (and complementary project support) will help further operationalize existing policies14 \nvia  a  series  of  policy  actions  aimed  at  (i)  MOE  approval  of  revised  national  curricula  for \npreservice teacher training for LSE and then USE, along with minimum quality standards for all \n13 teacher training institutions (TTIs);15 (ii) conduct and evaluation by MOE of a pilot test of a \nteacher placement scheme to attract TTI graduates to teach in remote areas; and (iii) approval \nby MOE of guidelines for use by provincial education services, district education bureaus, and \ninstitutions concerned with developing annual teacher recruitment and utilization plans. \n \n14.  Improving in-service teacher performance. Given the importance of monitoring and \nimproving  teacher  performance  to  improving  quality  and  advancing  pupil-centered  active \nlearning, the program will support the MOE\u2019s development and approval of guidelines and \nadoption of an operational manual for teacher performance monitoring and evaluation (M&E). \n \n15.  Secondary education subsector curriculum reform. As noted in paras. 5 and 7, the \nintroduction of an improved curriculum and related materials for the 7-year SES is a core thrust \n                                                \n13 The ESDF sets a target of extending stipends to eventually cover 20% of all LSE and USE students. \n14 These include the Teacher Education Strategy and Action Plan, and the Teacher Development and Management \nPolicy Framework and Action Plan developed with BESDP support and approved in 2011. \n15 The TTIs consist of 10 teacher education institutes and 3 faculties of education. \n ", "4 \nof national education reforms, as reflected in the ESDF. Building directly on reforms launched \nunder the BESDP and directly supported by the program\u2019s project component, the program will \nsupport the completion by the MOE of the cohort-based introduction of the new LSE curriculum, \nincluding nationwide textbook and teacher guide distribution and related teacher training for \nfourth year LSE in SY2013/14, followed by approval of new textbooks for all USE grades.16 \n  \nc.  Strengthened Secondary Education Subsector Management \n \n16.  Enhanced resourcing and planning for education. The Lao PDR Education Law, \nESDF, and other policy documents commit to increased education sector investment. The \nESDF targets increased and better-managed nonsalary recurrent costs and the introduction of \nblock grants as key thrusts. The program will directly support these thrusts, as well as measures \nsuch as school network mapping, which will be essential to ensure that investments in new \nschool construction align with the need to efficiently and equitably expand access. Supported by \nproject interventions, a series of policy actions aim at achieving (i) the 18% share of education \nin the total budget required by the Education Law; (ii) an increased share of nonsalary recurrent \nexpenditures within the MOE\u2019s total budget; (iii) development and approval of  a policy for \nintroducing block grants to cover recurrent costs at all levels within the MOE system, supported \nby a block grant management manual, and subsequent allocation and release of block grants \nfor LSE schools in all 30 districts classified as poorest and educationally disadvantaged (para. \n19); and (iv) MOE completion of nationwide SES school network mapping and issuance of a \ndecree on its use to guide planning for future capital investment. \n \n17.  Improved  stakeholder  mobilization  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology strategy. A final set of policy actions will promote broader education reforms and \nsector  performance  (particularly  in  the  SES):  (i)  approval  and  launch  of  a  communication \nstrategy within the MOE system and outwards to communities and other stakeholders; (ii) \napproval of a revised decree on private education;17 and (iii) approval of policy and a detailed \nstrategy for appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) to support grades 1\u2013\n12 education which are clearly dictated by education aims, equity, and sustainability. \n \n2.  Project Outputs \n \n18.  The  project  grant  supports  interventions  that  closely  align  with  and  support \nimplementation of the policy program. It directly supports attainment of national targets for the \nSES: outputs 2 and 3 (paras. 22\u201330) are nationwide in scope, while output 1 interventions \nstrategically focus on 30 target districts (para. 19) for maximum impact on access.18  \n \na.  Expanded Access to Secondary Education \n \n19.  Classroom provision to expand physical access.19 The output will provide a series of \nmeasures  to  expand  equitable  access  in  30  targeted  districts  that  are  classified  by  the \ngovernment as both \u201cpoorest\u201d and \u201ceducationally disadvantaged\u201d; these lie in 15 mostly poorer \nprovinces, and are clustered along the Lao PDR\u2019s borders. To address physical access, the \n                                                \n16 All textbooks and teacher guides developed will be sensitive to gender, ethnicity, and disability. \n17 This builds on BESDP support to the MOE to develop the Strategy for Promoting Private Education (approved in \n2011), which includes private schools as well as private (including nonprofit) actors\u2019 support to public schools. \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides more detailed \ndescriptions of project interventions. \n19 The project will provide one classroom per grade, one multi-use room (e.g., for science teaching and library use), \none teacher room, electricity, potable water supply, and sex-segregated sanitation facilities. USE classroom blocks \nwill indicatively also include one dedicated science laboratory. All designs will ensure access by disabled children. \n ", "5 \nprogram will (i) construct one new LSE school in underserved areas within each of the 30 target \ndistricts, (ii) build one USE classroom block20 at each of 15 existing school sites, and (iii) provide \nfurniture packages (plus teaching and learning materials under output 2). \n  \n20.  Direct support for disadvantaged students. The output will support (i) a baseline \nstudy to identify  candidates for LSE and USE  stipend support (starting in SY2012/13 and \nSY2013/14) from among eligible poor children expected to graduate in grades 5 and 9 the prior \nyear; (ii) provision of 4-year stipends for roughly 1,740 poor LSE entrants; and (iii) 3-year \nstipends for roughly 1,200 poor USE entrants. Detailed guidelines (to be agreed before fund \nrelease) will ensure at least 50% of recipients are girls and 80% are ethnic group students.21 \n \n21.  School-level support to enhance equitable access. Complementing stipend support \nin these 30 new and 30 existing LSE schools, the output will support (i) construction and \ncommunity management of low-cost dormitories, including sex-segregated sleeping facilities \nand sanitation facilities, and mechanisms for adult supervision; (ii) remedial support targeting \nboarders in particular;22 and (iii) school access grants, to be provided in four annual cycles \nbased on proposals from (and administered by) pupil\u2013parent associations (PPAs).23 Parallel \ninterventions will support expanded USE access at the 15 schools receiving USE stipends. \n \nb.  Improved Delivery of New Secondary Education Subsector Curricula \n \n22.  Preservice  training  and  placement  of  new  secondary  education  subsector \nteachers. To strengthen training and deployment of new SES teachers nationwide, the output \nwill (i) assist the MOE to develop preservice teacher training curricula (aligned with new SES \ncurricula) for use by all TTIs, and to introduce a TTI quality assurance system; (ii) bolstering TTI \ncapacities and instructional resources; (iii) pilot testing in five districts a new placement scheme \nto attract new science teachers to LSE schools in poor and remote areas;24 and (iv) developing \nprocedures, manuals, and M&E tools for teacher recruitment and utilization planning. \n \n23.  In-service teacher training and support. To prepare in-service teachers to deliver the \nnew SES curriculum, the output will support (i) annual nationwide teacher training during 2012\u2013\n2016 to support completion of the rollout of new LSE and then USE curricula;25 (ii) expansion of \nthe MOE\u2019s capacity to develop ICT-based materials (e.g., TV, radio, and DVD), particularly \nthose  to  support  teachers  and  teacher  training;  (iii)  capacity  development  for  secondary \npedagogical advisors nationwide via inclusion in training-of-trainers for the in-service training, \nand annual experience-sharing meetings; (iv) pilot testing a new initiative to equip secondary \npedagogical advisors in five districts with laptop computers and ICT materials, along with other \nsupport, to strengthen the advisors\u2019 role in providing in-school support for SES teachers; and (v) \nprovision of grants to allow 30 LSE science teachers to upgrade to bachelor degree level.26 \n                                                \n20 USE classroom blocks will be provided later in the project, often to extend an LSE school to cover USE grades. \nSites in the noted 15 provinces will be selected after the school network mapping under output 3. \n21 Output 3 will support LSE and USE stipend programs by mobilizing  pupil\u2013parent associations (PPAs) and \nsupporting M&E, including rigorous impact evaluation, to feed into policy dialogue on stipends. \n22 Priority will be given to boarding students (especially girls), many of whom will be ethnic students from more remote \nvillages, who are likely to have weaker foundations from primary school. \n23 PPA proposals for access grants will be based on local needs. Detailed guidelines (to be agreed upon before fund \nrelease) will specify eligible uses, including expansion of low-cost dormitories and/or remedial support, as well as \nsmall income-generating activities (e.g., school gardens) with a demonstrated link to increased access and equity.  \n24 This will include cash transfers to support placement and retention of 25 mostly female and ethnic TTI graduates in \ntheir first 2 years of teaching. M&E will assess options for sustainability and scaling up, and inform refinements. \n25 Virtually all SES teachers nationwide are expected to receive 5 days of face-to-face training at least once by project \nend (SES teachers typically teach multiple grades). Training will also include content on in-school peer training. \n26 Prioritizing female and ethnic group teachers, grants will support all costs of summer training over a 3-year period, \n ", "6 \n  24.  New curriculum materials (textbooks and teacher guides). Building directly on the \nBESDP (para. 7), the output will support printing and nationwide distribution of textbooks and \nteacher guides for the final 2 years of the new LSE curriculum to all schools teaching grades 8\u2013\n9  and  TTIs,  followed  by  development,  printing,  and  nationwide  distribution  of  new  USE \ncurriculum materials to all schools teaching grades 10\u201312.27 \n  \n25.  Teaching and learning equipment and materials. To support improved teaching in \nschools and classrooms provided under output 1, the program will provide packages of teaching \nand learning resources to the 30 new LSE schools and 15 USE classroom blocks.28 \n \n26.  Support for improved student assessment. The output will provide technical support \nto the MOE to strengthen national examinations for LSE and USE completion (grades 9 and \n12), including drafting of related rules and regulations. In parallel, it will support development of \nthe assessment of the student learning outcomes protocol for grades 9 and 12. \n \nc.  Strengthened Secondary Education Subsector Management \n \n27.  Support  for  enhanced  subsector  analysis.  The  output  will  support  (i)  further \ninstitutional analysis of the SES; (ii) nationwide SES school network mapping to identify unmet \ndemand and guide planning for network expansion; (iii) strengthening and integration of existing \nmanagement information system modules, in particular related to SES management; and (iv) \nfocused support on needs analysis and planning for the 30 districts targeted under output 1. \n \n28.  Capacity  building  for  secondary  education  subsector  staff  at  all  levels.  The \nprogram will support (i) phased and multimodal capacity building for education sector staff at all \nlevels;29 (ii) development and launch of the new MOE communication strategy (para. 17); (iii) \npolicy dialogue to revise the existing decree on private education, and mobilization of private \n(including nonprofit) actors\u2019 support to the SES; and (iv) the MOE\u2019s development of the policy \nand strategy on low-cost ICT to support teaching, learning, and school management. \n \n29.  Community  engagement  in  school  support  and  management.  PPAs  will  be \nestablished or reconstituted in 75 schools  supported under output 1, and will be provided \ncapacity building to support their management of stipends and access grants (paras. 20\u201321) \nand strengthen the PPAs\u2019 broader roles in expanding local enrolment and school management. \n \n30.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  output  will  support  project-wide  M&E,  including \ncapturing sex-disaggregated data on LSE and USE stipends, teacher training, and measures \nsuch as student enrolments and grade progression.

The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement.31 Determination of the program loan amount took into account factors including \n(i) the scope of proposed policy actions; (ii) the relative importance the government ascribes to \nthe education sector (including the SES), reflected in growing budgetary allocations; and (iii) the \nshort- and medium-term costs of the proposed policy actions and the associated financing \ngap.32 The program loan will be released in two equal tranches upon fulfillment of conditions \nexpected for achievement by the end of 2013 (tranche 1) and the end of 2016 (tranche 2).33 \n \n33.  Project grant investment plan. The project is estimated at $32.4 million equivalent \n(Table 2). The government has requested a grant not exceeding $30.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the project, including taxes and duties and specified \nrecurrent costs.34 The government will contribute $2.4 million, principally in-kind for provision of \nland, project management unit and consultant office accommodation (including utilities), and \nstaff inputs. \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \nItem    Amount ($ million)a  \nA.

The economic returns to secondary education are very high in developing countries.36 At \nthe national level, the role of the SES in supporting growth will be especially vital as the Lao \nPDR transitions from a planned to a market economy, from a subsistence to a commercial and \nregionally  integrated  economy,  and  from  an  agrarian  to  a  more  urbanized  society.37 For \nindividuals, the socioeconomic returns that result from completing LSE and USE are particularly \nhigh for girls and include access to the formal sector, higher-paying jobs, lower fertility, and \nincreased investment in human capital of the next generation. In terms of fiscal burden, the \nincremental costs (investment and recurrent) associated with the project have a peak value of \n2.6% of the total education budget midproject and fall below 0.5% post-project, which is deemed \nmodest and sustainable. Moreover, costs may be largely offset by sizeable efficiency gains due \nto increased completion of LSE and USE (dropout currently constitutes major wastage of state \n                                                \n35 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 ADB. 2010.

Governance \n36.  Assessments of MOE financial management and procurement capacity were conducted, \nwith mitigation measures identified (para. 40). The MOE has extensive experience with ADB \nprojects, and project management will benefit from the continuity of roles by the Department of \nSecondary Education, the project management unit, and other units under the BESDP. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the MOE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.38 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n37.  Poverty.  Pro-poor thrusts are mainstreamed within all three outputs under both the \nprogram and project. Supporting pro-poor policy thrusts under the program, project investments \ndirectly  or  indirectly  address  constraints  facing  the  poor  and  other  disadvantaged  groups, \nincluding (i) addressing direct and opportunity costs of education by providing needs-targeted \nstipends  and  school  access grants  in  the  30 highly  disadvantaged  districts;  (ii)  enhancing \ncurricular relevance; (iii) increasing the supply of qualified teachers in poor rural areas; (iv) \npromoting participation by all students via training on student-centered learning and (in target \nschools)  remedial  support  for  disadvantaged  children  (e.g.,  poor  children  from  non-Lao-\nspeaking families); (v) providing textbooks and library materials; and (vi) expanding LSE school \nnetworks to unserved areas in 30 districts, and providing LSE and USE dormitories, particularly \nfor girls and other poor ethnic group students from remote villages.39 \n \n38.  Gender. The program also tackles gender issues under all three outputs. To address \naccess constraints that often disproportionately affect girls, the gender action plan ensures that \n(i) new LSE schools are located in areas with low female enrolment; (ii) civil works at all LSE \nand USE sites include sex-segregated toilets; and (iii) poor girls receive 50% of dormitory \nspaces, stipends, and remedial learning opportunities. Quality-related actions include ensuring \ngender sensitivity in new curriculum materials (and via teacher training), and that females \nreceive 50% of places in (i) all preservice and in-service teacher training for LSE and USE \nteachers, (ii) the pilot teacher placement scheme, and (iii) teacher qualification upgrade grants. \nOutput  3  will  (i)  prioritize  female  representation  in  all  management  training  programs  and \nsupport strategies; (ii) conduct advocacy campaigns on the benefits of girls\u2019 schooling and \npromote their education in science; and (iii) provide recognition awards for districts with good \nequity-enhancement practices and increased access for girls, especially ethnic girls. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n39.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and environment, having no significant adverse impacts. \nIt is classified category B for indigenous peoples (termed \u201cethnic groups\u201d in the Lao PDR). All \nthree program outputs emphasize access, quality, and SES management in poor, remote, and \n                                                \n38 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2), with findings from a \nprocurement capacity assessment reflected in Appendix 18 to the project administration manual. \n39 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Gender Action Plan, and Indigenous Peoples Plan (Ethnic Group \nPlan) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nethnic group areas.40 Key features of the ethnic group plan include ensuring that (i) ethnic \ngroups receive (a) 80% of dormitory spaces, stipends, and remedial learning opportunities, (b) \n80% of places for a pilot teacher placement scheme and for teacher qualification upgrade grants, \nand (c) preferential access to in-service training (including as trainers); (ii) all textbooks and \nother materials developed under the project are ethnicity-sensitive; and (iii) institutional analysis, \nschool network mapping, M&E, and other analysis include ethnic group issues and criteria. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Potential risks include a faltering MOE commitment to sector strategies and targets, and \nlost momentum on budgetary increases. These will be mitigated by the program\u2019s reinforcement \nof the government\u2019s existing reform agenda, ESDF, and Education Law, including through the \ntwo-tranche program loan. Operational-side risks (e.g., related to financial management) will be \nminimized through continuity in project management structures with the BESDP, development \nof clear guidelines for key interventions, and consultant support. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.41 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n41.  The  government  and  MOE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  sector \ndevelopment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan and grant \ndocuments. The government and MOE have also agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nsector development program, which are set forth in the related agreements. Additionally, under \nthe grant, no disbursement shall be made for stipends or access grants (paras. 20\u201321) prior to \nMOE approval of detailed guidelines for these programs. \n \nV.
