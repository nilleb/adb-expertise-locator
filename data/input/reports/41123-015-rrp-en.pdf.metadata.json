THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Road Network Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The project aims to provide efficient transportation on the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS)  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC),  which  passes  through  Cambodia,  through  the \nimprovement of the national road sections in Prey Veng, Siem Reap, and Svay Rieng provinces \nof Cambodia that are unsafe and prone to flooding.1 The project will also (i) support the Ministry \nof Public Works and Transport (MPWT) in road asset management by (a) strengthening its axle \nload control operation, (b) introducing a quality assurance system, and (c) improving road \nmaintenance execution; and (ii) help project communities in improving their safety and health by \nimplementing a gender-responsive community-based road safety program and an HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking awareness and prevention program (HTAP).2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  In Cambodia, road transport is the dominant mode of transport. Roads are critical to social \nand economic development, especially in areas where they are the only available transport mode. \nThe  core  development  problem  with  Cambodia\u2019s  road  subsector  is  low  connectivity  and \ninefficiency. These problems are caused by incomplete regulatory frameworks, low institutional \ncapacity, limited private sector participation, lack of sustainability, and the incomplete state of the \nroad network. The Government of Cambodia is addressing these issues with the assistance of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the \nWorld Bank, and bilateral donors. The project will further help the government address the lack \nof connectivity, limited private sector participation, and lack of sustainability. \n \n4.  The road network managed by the MPWT comprises 2,254 kilometers (km) of one-digit \nnational roads, connecting the country with its borders and the GMS network; 5,007 km of two-\ndigit national roads; and 8,144 km of provincial roads. With the assistance of development \npartners, the government has focused on rehabilitating national roads and brought the paved road \nnetwork to 3,403 km (about 47% of national roads, as of 2016) with asphalt concrete, cement \nconcrete, and double bituminous surface treatment. With rapidly increasing traffic, there is a need \nto upgrade the national and provincial roads to higher standards to provide a better level of service. \nTherefore, the MPWT targets to (i) upgrade all one-digit national roads to asphalt concrete, \n(ii) increase the paved road ratio to 90%, and (iii) improve unsafe provincial roads by 2020. \n \n5.  The project will improve two one-digit national roads to asphalt concrete using a hybrid \nperformance-based contract (hybrid PBC) which involves construction and routine maintenance \nto promote engaging local contractors in road maintenance works. A hybrid PBC is being piloted \n                                                \n1  The SEC takes in the following four subcorridors: Central Subcorridor: Dawei\u2013Bangkok\u2013Phnom Penh\u2013Ho Chi Minh \nCity\u2013Vung Tau (SEC-1); Northern Subcorridor: Bangkok\u2013Siem Reap\u2013Stung Treng\u2013Pleiku\u2013Quy Nhon (SEC-2); \nSouthern  Coastal  Subcorridor:  Bangkok\u2013Trat\u2013Kampot\u2013Ha  Tien\u2013Nam  Can  (SEC-3);  and  Intercorridor  Link \nSihanoukville\u2013Phnom Penh\u2013Stung Treng\u2013Pakse\u2013Savannakhet (SEC-4). The project roads are along SEC-1 and \nSEC-2. \n2  The project is included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n ", "2 \nunder the World Bank-financed Road Asset Management Project II.3 Close coordination with the \nWorld Bank has already been initiated and will be pursued to ensure synergies and avoid overlaps. \n \n6.  Cambodia has been a key player in developing the GMS transport network. Cambodia \ncompleted the SEC subcorridors with a total length of 2,802 km (58% of the SEC) connecting the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam that form a part of its \nnational  road  network.  Since  2010,  the  MPWT  has  been  implementing  a  national  road \nimprovement program (including upgrading the SEC subcorridors to asphalt concrete and/or \nwidening them to four lanes to meet the growing traffic volume and axle loads). The project will \nsupport the MPWT\u2019s programs by improving two road sections along SEC-1 (a 97-km section of \nNational Road 1) and SEC-2 (a 50-km section of National Road 6). \n \n7.  While the MPWT is rehabilitating the road network, road conditions have deteriorated as \na result of flooding. The provinces located close to Tonle Sap and the Mekong River, which \ninclude the project provinces, are vulnerable to flooding. The MPWT prepared the Climate \nChange Action Plan for Transport Sector (2014\u20132018) to address both adaptation and mitigation \naspects of climate change in the transport sector. The ongoing ADB-financed Provincial Roads \nImprovement Project (PRIP) supports the implementation of the climate change action plan. 4 The \nPRIP prepared design tools for assessing flood risks, developed more climate-resilient roads, and \nprovided emergency management planning. The project will complement the PRIP outcomes by \n(i) enhancing these design tools through the transaction technical assistance (TA),5 and (ii) \nimplementing climate adaptation measures for the civil works. To improve project readiness, the \nTA will also prepare detailed engineering designs (DEDs) and assist procurement of the civil works. \n \n8.  By establishing weigh stations to control axle loads, the past ADB and JICA interventions \nmade some headway in preserving the MPWT\u2019s road assets from damage caused by overloaded \ntrucks.  However,  since  2012,  the  operation  of  weigh  stations  has  run  into  operational  and \ntechnological problems. The damage caused by overloaded vehicles has been estimated at $100 \nmillion. In May 2016, the MPWT requested ADB\u2019s support in exploring effective approaches to \ncontrol axle loads. In February 2017, ADB approved the capacity development TA for Institutional \nCapacity Building in the Road Sector to undertake deeper analysis on the technology being used \nin  all  weigh  stations  and  recommend  alternative  technologies,  approaches,  institutional \narrangements, and work processes required to effectively control overloading in Cambodia.6 In \nparallel, through the project and ongoing provincial roads project, ADB will help the MPWT refurbish \nthe weigh stations and implement the capacity development TA recommendations. \n \n9.  High-quality civil works are essential to sustain road assets and optimize available budget \nallocations. The MPWT recognizes this and, with the assistance of JICA, prepared a series of \ntechnical documents providing guidelines for inspecting civil works. However, the MPWT still lacks \na comprehensive quality assurance mechanism to undertake quality audit of works. The MPWT \nhas only one laboratory and as it is in Phnom Penh it is not able to carry out routine quality control \n                                                \n3  The Second Road Asset Management Project was approved in May 2016 and will provide periodic maintenance on \nnational roads and support for the road asset management system by updating the road database and upgrading \nthe maintenance planning tool. Procurement of civil works and goods and recruitment of consulting services are \nongoing. \n4  ADB. 2011.

The consulting services are ongoing. \n ", "3 \ntesting for road works throughout the country. Hence, there is a need to develop a quality \nassurance mechanism within the MPWT and establish regional laboratories to provide timely and \nquality testing of construction materials. \n \n10.  Road  safety  in  Cambodia  is  a  growing  concern.  In  2015,  the  Road  Crash  Victim \nInformation System of the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) recorded the fatality rate of 14.8 \nper 100,000 inhabitants, which is the second highest among member countries of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations. With limited budget and human resources, the NRSC has been \nstriving to implement the road safety programs in Cambodia, focusing primarily on Phnom Penh \nwhere  the  fatalities  are  the  highest.  While  80%  of  Cambodian\u2019s  live  in  rural  areas,  the \ngovernment\u2019s road safety initiatives in these areas are limited. ADB has been providing road \nsafety assistance as part of every road subsector intervention since 2008. The project will \ncontinue such efforts by improving awareness of road traffic regulations at the commune level, \nsince about 90% of crashes are attributable to road user error or behavioral issues. It is important \nto seek commune engagement in road safety to ensure the best possible results in changing road \nuser behavior. \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB has been one of the government\u2019s leading \npartners in developing the road subsector. ADB helped the government develop the road network, \nimprove road asset management, and adopt climate adaptation measures, and has developed a \nclose and successful partnership with the MPWT. The project will further build on this partnership \nby strengthening the capacity of the MPWT in implementing civil works by (i) improving contract \nmodels and using hybrid PBCs (para. 5) that provide (a) clear service levels and response times, \n(b) appropriate risk distribution between the MPWT and contractors, and (c) implementable \npenalty and incentive mechanisms; and (ii) introducing a quality assurance and quality control \nsystem (output 3). The project will also add value by introducing a technical audit to conduct due \ndiligence on procurement and execution of hybrid PBCs. \n \n12.  The project\u2019s  design  has  incorporated  lessons  learned  in  procurement and project \nimplementation. The TA (para. 7) will contribute to greater efficiency of  civil works by providing \nadvance preparation of the DEDs and procurement support and capacity building for the MPWT \nand local contractors with hybrid PBCs.7 \n \n13.  The project aligns with the priorities in the country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 to \nreduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  in  Cambodia. 8  The  project  supports  the  government's \nRectangular Strategy Phase III for 2013\u20132018 that emphasizes the need for development of \nphysical infrastructure along with three other core areas (agriculture sector promotion, private \nsector development and employment, and capacity building and human resource development) \nby  improving  national  and  regional  connectivity  and  building  institutional  capacity,  and the \nNational Strategic Development Plan 2014\u20132018.9 The project contributes to the GMS network \ndevelopment priorities and to ADB\u2019s climate adaptation finance targets (para. 23). \n   \n                                                \n7  The consulting services commenced in June 2017. DEDs are expected to be completed in September 2017 and the \nbidding documents are expected to be issued in October 2017. \n8  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Cambodia, 2014\u20132018.

Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: developed transport infrastructure to \nenhance national competitiveness and people's welfare. The project will have the following \noutcome: increased transport efficiency on the national road sections along the GMS SEC.10 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.   Output 1: More safe and climate-resilient national roads delivered. The project will \nimprove about 147 km of flood-prone and unsafe national roads through provision of periodic \nmaintenance of NR6 (50 km) and rehabilitation of NR1 (97 km) with asphalt concrete pavement. \nThe climate resiliency measures, such as reinforced embankment slope protection, increased \ndrainage capacity, and additional urban drains and outlets, will be provided on the project roads to \nensure all-year access and help reduce the vulnerability of communes to climate change. \n \n16.  Output 2: Axle load control enhanced. The project will help the MPWT control vehicle \noverloading through (i) refurbishing six weigh stations by (a) installing required equipment at \nBavet, Puok, and Thnal Tutoeng weigh stations; and (b) constructing office buildings for the \nKompong Thom, Kratie, and Steuong Treng weigh stations; (ii) providing portable weigh scales \nand vehicles for two mobile teams; and (iii) providing on-the-job training for staff in weigh stations \nand mobile teams. The project will implement pilot axle load control at selected goods\u2019 places of \norigin and introduce conditions to the civil works contract to require contractors to follow load limits \nwhen transporting construction materials. \n \n17.  Output 3: Quality assurance for civil works in the Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport strengthened. The project will help the MPWT to (i) establish a dedicated quality \nassurance wing to undertake quality audit on the completed civil works to ensure the quality meets \nthe specifications; (ii) establish and make operational four regional laboratories\u2014in Kampot, \nKratie, Pursat, and Siem Reap provinces\u2014to efficiently and effectively test construction materials; \n(iii) create a computerized laboratory information management system to integrate the activities \nof the regional laboratories; (iv) prepare standard operating procedures for the quality assurance \nwing and laboratory management and train staff in the operation of the new quality assurance \nprocess and procedures; and (v) purchase equipment for material testing and surveying road \nconditions. \n \n18.  Output 4: Road safety enforcement in project communes improved. This output \nfocuses  on  community-based  road  safety  activities  through  three  pillars  of  activities:  data \ncompilation and analysis, safe school zones, and enhanced law enforcement. Since Cambodia \nhas a relatively well-established data collection system\u2014the Road Crash Victim Information within \nthe NRSC\u2014road crash data at the commune level will be compiled and analyzed for formulating \nroad safety activities effective for communes. These data, along with school characteristics, are \ngathered to design safe school zones under this output. Finally, law enforcement is also supported \nby engaging (such as support with training and equipment) traffic police in the project area to \nfocus on enforcing the law to minimize the most common offenses for crashes: speeding, drunk-\ndriving behavior, and negligence in wearing helmets. The community-driven education will focus \non community awareness raising for changing behaviors that cause fatal crashes. \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "5 \n19.  Small works for safe school zone infrastructure, such as safety signs, humps, and lane \nmarkings (for schools along all project roads), will be provided. To supplement these road safety \nactivities, detailed design will include low-cost road safety engineering measures.11 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $76.7 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).12 \nThe  project  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment,  consulting  services,  project  administration, \noperation and maintenance of the project facilities (weigh stations and regional laboratories), and \ntaxes and duties. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Climate change adaptation and finance. The project is classified as being at high risk \nfrom future climate change impacts. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment completed under \nthe transaction TA indicated an increased risk of extreme rainfall events and flood because of \nclimate change. Climate adaptation measures are estimated to cost around $4 million. ADB will \nfinance 92.5% of adaptation costs. The project does not include specific climate mitigation \nmeasures. However, the improved road condition has been calculated to result in a net reduction \nof 45,687 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The executing agency will be the MPWT and the implementing agency will be the project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  will  have  overall  coordination  and  implementation \nresponsibility and be supported by (i) implementation and construction supervision consultants \nfor implementing outputs 1\u20133, (ii) road safety consultants for implementing output 4, (iii) a \ntechnical auditor for execution of a hybrid PBC, and (iv) a procurement consultant for undertaking \nprocurement of small civil works and goods. Because they have undertaken several ADB-\nfinanced projects, the MPWT and PMU have experience in and a detailed understanding of ADB\u2019s \nprocurement and financial management policies and procedures. In addition, the PMU will benefit \nfrom the capacity development TA for Strengthening Capacity for Improved Implementation of \nExternally Funded Projects in Cambodia and further strengthen its skills in project management.13 \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2022 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2022 \nEstimated loan closing date  June 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(iii) Key implementing  Project Management Unit 3 \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  Phnom Penh, 24 staff \nProcurement  International competitive  4 contracts  $53.47 million \nbidding \nNational competitive bidding  7 contracts  $3.24 million \nShopping  3 contracts  $0.19 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  609 person- $3.47 million \nselection  months \nIndividual consultant selection  12 person- $0.08 million \nmonths \n                                                \n13 ADB.  2017.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The project was assessed as technically viable. Several climate adaptation measures and \nroad safety measures, such as reinforced embankment slope protection, increased drainage \ncapacity, and additional urban drains and outlets, have been included in the project design to \nkeep the completed roads open to users and traffic in all weather conditions. The provision of \nlocal  capacity  building  to  operate  and  maintain  the  project\u2019s  weigh  stations  and  regional \nlaboratories has been incorporated in the project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The project is economically viable. The economic internal rate of return is 17.9%, and the \nnet present value is $27.1 million at a 9.0% discount rate. Additional benefits from the avoidance \nof potential future flooding on project roads, better safety and axle load control, and improved \nquality of maintenance works were not included in the quantitative analysis but would improve the \neconomic returns of the project.14 \n \n27.  Financial analysis demonstrated that funds allocated from the national budget to the MPWT \nhave steadily increased since 2014, although a major portion of the national and provincial road \nnetwork still needs maintenance and rehabilitation.15 Road maintenance funding must be in place \nin a sustainable manner. The ongoing capacity development TA (para. 8) will assist the MPWT in \nexploring several alternative road financing options in addition to the national budget to help \nsustain road assets at desirable levels. Outputs 2 and 3 will help avoid premature deterioration of \nroads from overloaded trucks and poor quality of civil works at both the construction and \nmaintenance stages. In addition, the World Bank's Road Asset Management Project II will \nenhance the current maintenance planning process that will optimize maintenance priority of the \nMPWT's roads, including the project roads, based on road conditions and traffic volumes. These \narrangements will make the project more sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  All procurement of goods, works and services to be financed by the loan will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The risk rating for the project procurement \nrisk  assessment  is  substantial.  The  assessment  concluded  that  the  implementation  of  the \nrecommended mitigation measures are considered satisfactory overall. However, the project \nincludes hybrid PBCs, which have not been used before in Cambodia, and all three contract \n                                                \n14 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \npackages will have prior review by ADB. The transaction TA (para. 7) will provide training for \nMPWT  staff  and  workshops  for  local  contractors  on  the  use  of  hybrid  PBCs,  which  will \ncomplement the capacity building activities being provided by the World Bank. \n \n29.  The financial management assessment confirms that the MPWT has adequate financial \nmanagement arrangements for implementing the project. The overall financial management risk is \nmoderate. The MPWT has good financial management capacity (para. 24), and the ongoing World \nBank project will further strengthen this. In addition, with appropriate mitigation measures involving \nappointment of additional staff and training under the project, the risk will be alleviated. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the government  and  the  MPWT. The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  The project will benefit about 290,000 persons in 31 communes in three provinces. The \npoverty rates in the three project provinces are 23.6% in Prey Veng, 17.7% in Siem Reap, and \n17.3% in Svay Rieng, and all are in the mid-range of the country\u2019s provincial poverty rate, which \nranges from 9.0% in Phnom Penh to 33.0% in Battambang.16 Improved mobility will provide poor \nrural communities with all-year access to larger markets, health centers, education facilities, and \ngovernment organizations, and reduced travel times and transport costs will contribute to lower \ninput costs and higher prices for agricultural products. The project civil works will provide job \nopportunities for the local households, including women, especially during the farming off-season. \n \n32.  Improved connectivity and mobility also result in increased social risks, including risks of \nHIV and sexually transmitted infections, human trafficking, unsafe migration, as well as road \ncrashes. As of 30 November 2016, there were 646 cases of HIV/AIDS in project areas, 59% of \nwhom were women. Over 85% of road crash victims are poor and vulnerable road users, such as \npedestrians, motorcycle riders, and bicyclists, many of whom are women. Road user education \non road safety is minimal, and high illiteracy rates in rural areas (which are even higher for women \nthan for men) further impede such measures. To address this, the project will include a gender-\nresponsive HTAP and a community-based road safety program. \n \n33.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has \nbeen  developed.17 The  project  will  directly  benefit  women  through  (i)  access  to  unskilled \nemployment in civil works with equal pay for work of equal value; (ii) opportunities for meaningful \nand active participation in consultations; (iii) implementation of a gender-responsive HTAP, which \nwill target 100% of the road workers and the majority of the affected communities, including 50% \nwomen; and (iv) implementation of a community-based gender-responsive road safety awareness \nprogram. Progress on gender action plan implementation will be monitored and reported to ADB \nquarterly. \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:  \n                                                \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \n \n35.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), which cover all project facilities, have been prepared.18 The draft IEE \nhas been disclosed on the ADB website and the final IEE will be disclosed following the DED. \nPublic consultations were carried out to inform the project design and environmental assessment \nprocess,  and  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  Implementation  and  construction \nsupervision consultants will provide support for EMP implementation. Environmental complaints \nwill be handled through a grievance redress mechanism (GRM). \n \n36.  The project roads generally pass through agricultural land, rice paddy, and plantations, \ncrossing a small number of minor rivers. No protected areas or species have been identified within \nthe project area of influence. The construction of four regional laboratories will be within existing \nprovincial public works and transport department premises. The adverse environmental impacts \nwill primarily occur during construction from dust, noise, vibration, disposal of construction spoils, \nworker and community health and safety hazards, increased traffic, and disruption of access. The \nEMP (i) includes mitigation measures during construction and operational phases, including \n(a) waste management and spoil disposal, (b) materials management, (c) drainage management, \n(d) temporary transport management, (e) noise and dust control, and (f) worker and public safety; \nand (ii) identifies responsible parties and budget for implementation and monitoring. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Civil works for NR1 and NR6 and weigh stations \nwill be confined to existing road widths. Ancillary works, including installation of new drainage and \nslope protection, are expected to be within unoccupied areas of the road right of way. There may \nbe temporary impacts and/or disturbances during works implementation, such as breakage of \nconcrete pavements in front of shops as well as disturbance to residence entrances and public \nfacilities. Such impacts will be mitigated and restored through implementation of the EMP. \nAccordingly,  no  resettlement-related  impacts  are  expected.  Nevertheless,  a  resettlement \nframework has been prepared to address potential (but at this stage, unlikely) unanticipated \nresettlement  impacts.  Following  DEDs,  a  resettlement  due  diligence  assessment  will  be \nconducted to either confirm there are no resettlement impacts or inform the nature of resettlement \nimpacts. If resettlement impacts are deemed probable at that stage, the involuntary resettlement \ncategorization will be revised as needed and a resettlement plan prepared in accordance with the \nagreed resettlement framework.19 \n \n38.  The  General  Department  of  Resettlement  will  be  responsible  for  preparation, \nimplementation, internal monitoring the  resettlement framework and resettlement  safeguard \nrequirements. Internal monitoring will be reported in the project quarterly monitoring reports. If a \nresettlement plan is later required, semiannual external resettlement monitoring reports will be \nprepared and uploaded to the ADB website. All complaints will be handled through a GRM, and \nall contractors will be briefed by the Inter-Ministerial Resettlement Committee on the GRM. \nFurthermore, public consultations have been conducted with various stakeholders comprising \ngovernment agencies, local authorities, and affected households, and will continue during project \nimplementation. The resettlement framework has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities will be \naffected by the project. In the project area, less than 1% of the total project beneficiaries are ethnic \nminorities (276 Cham and 107 Vietnamese) and are integrated into mainstream society. \n                                                \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n19 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.  The overall project\u2019s risk is moderate. Risk mitigation measures have been established \ngiven that (i) the government\u2019s commitment to axle load control may not be sustained beyond the \nproject period, resulting in premature deterioration of the project roads; and (ii) the MPWT will use \na new contract modality (hybrid PBC). Substantial risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nChanges in government  MPWT\u2019s capacity in controlling axle load is being strengthened under the \npriorities shift resources  ongoing capacity development technical assistance for Institutional Capacity \naway from axle load  Building in the Road Sectora to control overloaded trucks in a sustainable \ncontrol.  manner, in addition to making the key six weigh stations and two additional \nmobile teams under the project operational.
