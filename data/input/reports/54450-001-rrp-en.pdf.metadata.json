SJPL  delivers  energy  savings \nthrough a combination of (i) a proprietary Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensing and analytics \nplatform, and (ii) the application of an Energy Efficiency as a Service (EEaaS) business model. \nThe  investment  will  improve  energy  efficiency  in  commercial  buildings  by  reducing  carbon \nemissions and making the distribution system smarter. SJPL\u2019s vision to promote energy efficiency \nand  eliminate  energy  poverty  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s operational  priorities  to tackle  climate  change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability in Asia and \nthe Pacific. 3,  \n \n\n \n\nTHE INVESTMENT \n\n \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \n3. \nIndian  energy  sector.  India  is  the  world\u2019s  third  largest  electricity  consumer.  Energy \ndemand grew by about 6% annually during 2010\u20132019, in line with growth in India\u2019s population \nand average income levels. India\u2019s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions comprised 6.4% of \nthe  global  share  in  2019.  Energy  demand  could  double  by  2040,  with  electricity  demand \npotentially  tripling  because  of  increased  appliance  ownership  and  cooling  needs.  Without \nsignificant improvements in energy efficiency, India will need to add massive amounts of power \ngeneration capacity, of which about 60% is coal-fired.4 \n \n4. \nEnergy efficiency industry overview. India\u2019s energy saving potential is estimated to be \n15%\u201330% across all demand segments, totaling about $10 billion per annum, with commercial \nand  industrial  buildings  offering  very  high  saving  potential. 5 Cooling  services  are  particularly \nenergy-intensive in the  commercial  and  industry building  segment,  with  India\u2019s  air-conditioning \nmarket expected to increase more than 30 times to 1 billion units by 2050.6 The energy efficiency \nindustry in India, however, faces various financial and technical barriers that deter investment. \nFinancial  barriers  include  the  weak  balance  sheet  of  traditional  energy  efficiency  service \nproviders,  the  small  size  and  high  transaction  costs  of  individual  projects,  and  high  risk \nperceptions of financial institutions because of limited familiarity and capacity to evaluate energy \nefficiency service providers. \n \nWomen\u2019s participation in the energy efficiency solutions industry. The energy sector \n5. \nis  a  nontraditional  area  for  women  because  of  the  stereotypical  view  of  energy  technological \n\n \n\n1  The investment financing will be administered by ADB.

Despite public sector interventions, including ADB \nprojects,  India\u2019s  energy  service  company  (ESCO)  industry  has  faced  market  development \nchallenges.11  ESCOs have typically struggled to scale up because of the lack of transparency in \nactual savings, lack of clear ownership rights between tenant and building owners to apportion \nthe  resultant  energy  savings,  uncertain  payback  periods,  and  the  consequential  inability  to \ngenerate appropriate financial returns on investments made by the ESCOs. Technology (including \nthe  use  of  IoT,  sensors,  and  artificial  intelligence  data  analytics)  and  innovative  financing  are, \nhowever, creating a new generation of EEaaS and equipment as service providers in emerging \nmarkets. These new technology-enabled business models are generating more significant energy \nsavings and faster payback periods.12  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted  \n \n\nOwnership and Management  \n\n \nConfidential Information Deleted  \n \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\n \n\nTHE ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \n7. \nADB  will  administer  the  provision  of  assistance  by  the  fund  of  up  to  the  Indian  rupee \nequivalent of $2,000,000 by way of an equity investment in SJPL. The investment will be in the \nform  of  new  equity  (through  a  fresh  issuance  of  shares),  and  ADB  is  expected  to  have  an \nownership  stake  of  about  10%.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  nominate  a  member  or  observer  to \nSJPL\u2019s  board  of  directors.  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  constitute  about  50%  of  this financing  round. \nADB expects to mobilize parallel equity financing of at least $8 million during 2021\u20132024.

ADB will monitor the investment, and investment reporting will \nbe subject to certain information disclosure requirements, in addition to  compliance with Indian \nlegal and regulatory requirements. SJPL will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined \nregular intervals and on request, including (i) a report on the use of the subscription proceeds, \n(ii) quarterly  and  annual  financial  statements  for  the  past  period,  and  (iii)  annual  budget  and \nbusiness plans for the following financial year. \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n\n \n\n \n\nEvaluation.

Asia and the Pacific is \nexpected to double its energy consumption by 2030, so the role of ADB in implementing energy \nprojects  is  more  crucial  than  ever.  The  investment  will  support  the  evolving  field  of  energy \nefficiency, which is critical in reducing India\u2019s carbon footprint and in addressing climate change. \nBy leveraging ADB\u2019s network, SJPL will be catalytic in establishing EEaaS as a business model. \nFurther, the fund\u2019s long investment horizon will allow SJPL to leapfrog into other emerging Asia \nmarkets\u2014limiting divestment concerns. \n \n11. \nResource  mobilization.  The  investment  is  anticipated  to  have  a  significant  signaling \neffect and is likely to increase the market\u2019s confidence in SJPL achieving its business goals. This \nwill help SJPL in critical areas, such as testing new products, and attracting future debt and equity.  \n\n12. \nProgress  to  market-leading  standards.  As  the  first  and  only  development  finance \ninstitution shareholder, ADB will help develop and support SJPL\u2019s adherence to high corporate \ngovernance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social  and \nenvironmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in the Indian energy sector. ADB \nwill also add value to SJPL by assisting it to (i) establish a more balanced board, including the \ncreation  of  a  financial  management  committee  and  an  audit  committee;  (ii)  implement  an \nenvironmental and social management system; and (iii) incorporate gender-inclusive workplace \npolicies. \n \n\n13  ADB. 2020.

The investment is in all respects \ncompliant with the fund\u2019s objectives, as set out in the relevant contractual documents. In addition, \nthe  investment  will  contribute  to  the  following  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030  and  the \ncorresponding operational plans (OP): (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities \n(OP1);  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (OP  2);  and  (iii)  tackling  climate  change, \nbuilding  climate,  disaster  resilience  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability  (OP3). 17 The \ninvestment  is  also  aligned  with  the  objective  of  the  India  country  partnership  strategy  of \naddressing climate change and increasing climate resilience.18  \n \n\n \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n16. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  C),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).19 \n \n\nDelhi. p. 29. \n\n \n\n15 Government of India. 2015.

In its mission to build general skills on energy efficiency solutions, SJPL is looking \nto  further  promote  more  women\u2019s  participation.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998), SJPL has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key gender actions relate to targeting the participation of \nclients\u2019 female staff in capacity building activities on the use of energy efficiency solutions, and \nenhancing gender equality at the company level through the implementation of a women-focused \nrecruitment  strategy  and  an  internship  program  focused  on  female  students  or  graduates  in \ntechnical  fields.  A  gender  target  was  also  identified  to  raise  awareness  among  Smart  Joules\u2019 \nemployees on this issue, with the introduction of training for staff on sexual harassment  in the \nworkplace.
