An environmental impact assessment was completed. \nThe  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was  circulated  to \nthe  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and \nposted on the ADB website on 19 November 2008. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  help  promote  balanced  and  environmentally \nsustainable urbanization; narrow the urban\u2013rural gap; and improve \nproduction,  employment,  and  living  conditions  in  small  cities  and \ntowns  in  Liaoning  Province.  It  will  support  the  development  of \nselected small cities and towns in the province. The Project is being \nprocessed  as  a  sector  loan  to  allow  the  Liaoning  provincial \ngovernment  (LPG)  to  respond  to  rapidly  changing  needs  of  cities \nand  towns  across  the  province.  The  Project  includes  about  seven \nsubprojects,  including  three  core  subprojects\u2014Donggang  City, \nKazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County,  and  Linghai  City. \nSubsequent  subprojects  will  be  selected,  prepared,  and  appraised \nduring project implementation following an agreed set of criteria and \nprocedures.  The  Donggang  City  core  subproject  has \nthree \ncomponents:  (i)  roads  and  bridge,  and  associated  services; \n(ii)  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment;  and  (iii)  river  improvement \nand  area  upgrading.  The  Kazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County \ncore subproject has one water supply component. The Linghai City \ncore subproject has one component for construction and upgrading \nof roads, and associated services.  \n \nThe  PRC  Government  is  committed  to  developing  small  cities  and \ntowns  as  a  way  to  generate  jobs,  narrow  the  rural\u2013urban  income \ngap,  and  increase  national  economic  productivity.  Growth  of  small \ncities  and  towns  creates  economic  opportunities  for  farmers  to \nmove to urban areas and gain higher value-added employment; this \nis the key to realizing the PRC\u2019s vision of a \u201charmonious society,\u201d in \nwhich  the  benefits  of  growth  will  be  shared  more  equitably.  The \nPRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) 2006\u20132010 identifies small city \nand town development as a means to provide a higher standard of \nliving  to  rural  migrants  without  exacerbating  infrastructure  fatigue \nand  other  problems  afflicting \nthe \nconclusions of the ADB-financed Town-Based Urbanization Strategy \n\nlarge  cities.  Building  on \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nto \n\nlinkages  between  major  cities \n\nStudy, the national town development policy calls for strengthening \nin \nphysical  and  economic \nmetropolitan  areas  or  development  corridors  and  the  smaller \nsettlements  at  their  periphery,  and  stresses  the  development  of \nsmall  cities  and  towns  by  facilitating  the  development  of  larger \nurban agglomerations. \n \nLiaoning  Province,  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nnortheast, \nthe  PRC\u2019s \nfunctions  as  a  major  hub  between \nnortheastern economic region and the Pan-Bohai economic region. \nHistorically  a  base  for  industrial  materials  and  machinery,  it  has \nfaced  economic  challenges  related \nindustrial  restructuring \nmoving  from  state-owned  heavy  industries  to  light  and  service \nindustries  to  promote  balanced  development  and  focus  on  growth \nbased  on  economic  demand.  Many  state  firms  have  closed  or  are \nexperiencing  major  losses.  While  state  investment  has  aided  the \nindustrial transformation, local governments, particularly small cities \nand towns, have had difficulty finding catalysts for new employment \nand economic growth. Small cities and towns in the province have \nmade  progress  in  recent  years  in  facilitating  economic  growth,  but \nstill lag the big cities. The rapid development and race to urbanize \nand  industrialize  have  left  many  with  significant  pollution  problems \nand  correspondingly  poor  living  conditions,  and  outstripped  the \ncapacity to provide services. More jobs are also needed to stimulate \ngrowth  driven  by  domestic  demand  instead  of  relying  on  exports. \nWhile  many  small  cities  and \ntowns  have  made  significant \ninvestments  in  different  types  of  urban  infrastructure,  few  have \ndeveloped  an  integrated  approach  to  the  development  of  various \ninfrastructure  sectors.  LPG  is  promoting  the  development  of  small \ncities  and  towns  in  a  more  coordinated  and  cost-effective  manner \nby  encouraging  more  sustainable  investments  in  physical  and \nenvironmental protection infrastructure to improve the quality of life \nand create conditions favorable for a strategic shift of the rural labor \nforce. \n \nThe  Project  is  a  direct  response  to  Liaoning\u2019s  11FYP  to  promote \nsustainable  economic  development,  particularly  in  its  small  cities \nand  towns,  via  construction  and  upgrading  of  road  infrastructure, \nwater  supply,  and  environmental  improvement.  All  components  in \nthe  Project  are  integral  components  of  the  11FYP.  The  proposed \nsubprojects  focus  on  supporting  sustainable  urban  development \nand comprise a number of sector interventions primarily targeted to \nsupport  job  creation,  economic  growth,  environmental  protection, \nimprovement of infrastructure and municipal services, and industrial \ndevelopment,  to  address  key  infrastructure  sector  issues  in  the \nsubproject  cities  and  towns.  The  main  sectors  are  roads  and \nassociated  services,  water  and  wastewater,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  river  improvement  and  area  upgrading,  and  district \nheating.  ADB\u2019s  experience  and  knowledge  in  urban  environmental \nimprovement  and  management,  including  supporting  utility  tariff \nreforms, will add value to the Project, especially for small cities and \ntransformation. \ntowns  undergoing  urbanization  and  economic \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n% of \nTotal \n42.3 \n0.0 \n\n21.0 \n3.2 \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nTo allow greater flexibility during project implementation, the Project \nuses a sector loan approach and develops subproject identification, \nselection,  and  appraisal  criteria  and  procedures  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of sector policies and plans. \n \nThe  impacts  of  the  Project  are  improved  living  conditions  and \nincreased  employment  generation  in  small  cities  and  towns  in \nLiaoning  Province.  The  project  outcome \nimproved  urban \ninfrastructure  and  municipal  services  in  about  seven  small  cities \nand towns in the province. \n \n\nis \n\n \nProject Investment Plan   The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $236.5  million, \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nSource \n\nincluding taxes and duties of $16.0 million. \n \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent) \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund under the Water \n\nFinancing Partnership Facilitya \n\nDonggang City Government \nKazuo Mongolian Autonomous County \n\nGovernment \n\n100.0 \n0.3 \n\n49.7 \n7.6 \n\nTotal \n\n7.3 \n26.2 \n100.0 \n\n17.2 \n61.7 \n236.5b \n\nLinghai City Government \nOther City and County Governments \n \na  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway.

A Liaoning project management office (PMO) was \nestablished  to  undertake  and  manage  day-to-day  activities  in \nconnection  with  the  Project,  including  selection  and  appraisal  of \nsubsequent  subprojects.  In  each  subproject  city  and  town,  a  PMO \nhas  been  set  up  to  liaise  with  the  Liaoning  PMO  and  departments \nand  bureaus  concerned,  and  to  oversee  and  manage  (i)  work \nundertaken  by  the  implementing  agencies,  (ii)  overall  project \nfinance, and (iii) project implementation. \n \nGoods,  works,  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \nInternational  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive \ntime). \nbidding,  or  shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  procurement, \nbased on the circumstances of each contract package. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  for  international  and  national \nconsulting  services \nimplementing \nagencies  with  project \nimplementation,  management,  and \ninstitutional  capacity  building.  The  consulting  services  will  cover \n(i)  project  management,  (ii)  the  project  performance  management \nsystem,  (iii)  financial  management,  (iv)  social  and  environmental \nsupport,  (v)  operation  and  maintenance,  and  (vi)  institutional \nstrengthening.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  260,000  residents  of  the  three  core \nsubproject cities and towns of Liaoning, as well as residents of four \nsubsequent  subproject  cities  and  towns  that  have  a  total  urban \npopulation  of  about  660,000.  The  percentage  of  poor  among \nbeneficiaries  in  the  three  core  subproject  towns  is  9.0%  in  Kazuo, \n4.5%  in  Linghai,  and  3.5%  in  Donggang.  Major  socioeconomic \nimpacts  include  (i)  improvement  of  living  standards  through  the \nprovision of essential public infrastructure; (ii) improvement of public \nhealth  through  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvement; \n(iii)  improvement  of  the  quality  and  affordability  of  basic  services; \n(iv) job creation; (v) environmental protection through improvement \nof the sewage collection system and flood control; (vi) facilitation of \nmobility,  access,  and  affordability  of  key  basic  services  and \ndestinations  through  road  construction;  and  (vii)  provision  of  skills \ntraining. \n \nThe  infrastructure  improvements  financed  under  the  Project  are \nanticipated  to  produce  substantial  environmental  and  economic \nbenefits. Provision of water supply will have quantifiable impacts on \npublic  health  in  terms  of  savings  made  on  medical  consultations \nand purchase of medicines. This will reduce domestic work, largely \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual \n\n \n\nv\n\nundertaken  by  women,  such  as  water  collection  and  disposal, \ncleaning,  and  caring  for  the  sick.  Jobs  created  will  attract  surplus \nrural labor to urban areas and address unemployment, provide new \nskills to workers, and stimulate a number of secondary industries. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  climate  change  adaptation  through \nmeasures to improve flood control and strengthen water resources \nmanagement  in  the  subproject  cities  and  towns  that  are  prone  to \nincreasing floods and droughts. \n \n\n \n\ntechnical \n\nrisks. \nConventional  engineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable \nperformance  will  be  adopted  for  (i)  road  and  bridge  construction, \n(ii)  installation  of  municipal  services  along  roads,  (iii)  water  supply \nand  wastewater  management,  (iv)  river  improvement  and  area \nupgrading,  (v)  solid  waste  treatment,  (vi)  environmental  sanitation, \n(vii) heating, and (viii) landscaping. During implementation, the loan \nimplementation consultant will support the PMOs and implementing \nagencies  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  works  comply  with  design \nand quality assurance requirements. \n \nThe following risks could affect the timely implementation, economic \nviability,  and  realization  of  project  benefits:  inadequate  preparation \nand  late  selection,  appraisal,  and  implementation  of  subsequent \nsubprojects;  failure  to  implement  institutional  strengthening  for \neffective  project  implementation  and  management,  and  corporate \ngovernance;  lack  of  proper  operation  and  maintenance  of  project \nfacilities; late consultant selection; delay in completion of associated \nprojects; major amendments and changes to implementation of the \nmaster  plans  in  subproject  cities  and  towns;  delay  in  the  provision \nof  counterpart  funding;  failure  to  establish  or  increase  water  and \nwastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  and  unforeseen \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  which  could  hamper  the \nefficient  implementation  of  project  works  and  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods of affected persons. \n \ninstitutional \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated \narrangements and project management; extensive and appropriate \ntraining  on  ADB  and  domestic  procedures  and  requirements; \nprovision  of  institutional  capacity  building,  and  appropriate  project \nimplementation and monitoring arrangements for the subproject city \nand town PMOs and implementing agencies with support from the \nloan  implementation  consultant;  synchronization  of  the  project \ndesign  and  implementation  schedules  with  associated  projects \nplanned; covenanted assurances from the subproject city and town \ngovernments  on  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding,  and  on \nregular  tariff  reviews  and  increases;  strengthening  of  internal \nmonitoring and supervision by the Liaoning subproject city and town \nPMOs  and  the  implementing  agencies;  and  engagement  of  a \nqualified external agency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. \n\nthrough  effective \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n114  00'E\n\no\n122  00'E\n\nSiping\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\n124  00'Eo\n\nLIAONING SMALL CITIES AND\nTOWNS DEVELOPMENT\nDEMONSTRATION SECTOR PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nJ I L I N\n\nShenyang\n\nTieling\n\nL I A O N I N G\n\nLinghai\n\nKazuo\nJinxi\n\nYingkou\n\nLiaoyang\n\n41  00'No\n\nShanhaiguan\n\nDonggang\n\nQinhuangdao\n\n41  00'No\n\nZhangijakou\n\nYouyu\n\nDatong\n\nBEIJING\n\nYuanping\n\nS H A N X I\n\nTaiyuan\n\nBazhou\n\nH E B E I\n\nZhufutun\n\nShijiazhuang\nZhaozhou\n\nTianjin\n\nTangshan\n\nT I A N J I N\n\nDalian\n\nBohai   Sea\n\nWutong\n\nPingyao\n\nJinzhou\n\nS H A N D O N G\n\n36  00'No\n\nXiangyuan\n\nPingshun\n\nHouma Jincheng\n\nH E N A N\n\no\n114  00'E\n\n36  00'No\n\nYellow   Sea\n\no\n122  00'E\n\n120  00'Eo\n\n43  00'No\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\nSiping\n\n43  00'No\n\nJ I L I N\n\nFuxin\n\nTieling\n\nXinmin\n\nChaoyang\n\nBeizhen\n\nHeishan\n\nNanzamu\n\nFushun\n\nSHENYANG\n\nLingyuan\n\nKazuo\n\nJianchang\n\nJinxi\n\nGoubangzi\n\nLinghai\n\nJinzhou\n\nPanjin\n\nLiaozhong\n\nLiaoyang\n\nAnshan\n\nHaicheng\n\nBenxi\n\nNanfen\n\nH E B E I\n\nSuizhong\n\nLiaodong  Bay\n\nYingkou\n\nL I A O N I N G\n\nKuandian\n\nGai Zhou\n\nFengcheng\n\nGushan\n\nDandong\n\nDonggang\n\nZhuanghe\n\nXinjin\n\n39  00'No\n\nCore Subproject City/Town\n\n39  00'No\n\nDalian\n\nB o h a i     G u l f\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\n120  00'Eo\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n124  00'Eo\n\n09-2967 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  both  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the \nLiaoning  Small  Cities  and  Towns  Development  Demonstration  Sector  Project.  The  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  stakeholders  analysis,  and  problems  and  objectives \ntree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  improve  urban \n2. \ninfrastructure and municipal services in about seven small cities and towns in Liaoning Province by \nconstructing  and  upgrading  roads,  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  heating,  and  other \nenvironmental services to facilitate sustainable and inclusive economic development and enhance \nthe quality of life of residents, including the poor, in the less developed small urban settlements in \nthe province.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSince  the  1980s,  the  PRC  Government  has  progressively  relaxed  migration  policies  to \naccess  low-cost  rural  labor.  The  urban  population  has  tripled,  reaching  577  million  in  2006, \naccounting for 44% of the total population; it is expected to exceed 50% by 2015. The urban\u2013rural \nincome  gap  is  large;  the  average  disposable  income  of  urban  residents  is  about  3.3  times  the \naverage  net  income  of  farmers  in  2006.  With  increasing  mechanization  in  the  agriculture  sector, \nmillions of rural migrants seek employment in urban areas each year. The challenges of providing \nemployment, housing, and services to the urban population are massive. The Government favors \nurbanization  as  a  means  to  increase  national  economic  productivity  and  promote  harmonious \ndevelopment,  in  which  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  will  be  shared  more  equitably.  The  11th \nFive-Year Plan (FYP) 2006\u20132010 continues the policy of promoting the development of small cities \nand  towns,  which  has  the  potential  to  (i)  provide  higher  living  standards  to  migrants  without \nexacerbating  infrastructure  capacity  and  problems  afflicting  large  cities,  (ii)  increase  productivity, \nand  (iii)  narrow  the  income  gap,  thereby  contributing  to  social  stability. 1 It  proposes  \u201ccoordinated \ndevelopment of big, medium and small cities and small towns\u201d and identifies urban agglomerations \nas the main model for future urbanization. Building on the conclusions of the ADB-financed Town-\nBased  Urbanization  Strategy  Study, 2 the  11FYP  proposes  strengthening  physical  and  economic \nlinkages  between  major  cities  in  metropolitan  areas  or  major  development  corridors  and  smaller \nsettlements at their periphery. \n \n4. \nOver  the  last  20  years,  economic  progress  in  the  PRC  has  largely  taken  place  in  large \nmetropolitan  regions  and  provincial  capitals  with  better  access  to  resources.  In  large  cities \ninfrastructure  networks  such  as  transport,  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  and  electrical \npower are overused and showing signs of fatigue; economic efficiency is being compromised; and \nenvironmental  costs  are  rising.  Small  cities  and  towns  represent  an  underutilized  resource  in  the \nPRC  urban  system.  The  average  combined  annual  growth  rate  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary \nsectors  in  large  and  medium-sized  cities  was  14.2%  during  2001\u20132005,  compared  with  5.4%  in \nsmall cities and towns. During 1988\u20132002, the gap between public investment per capita in large \nand  medium-sized  cities  versus  small  cities  and  towns  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  2.8%, \ncontributing to a gap in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which grew at 3.1% annually. While \nmany  cities  and  towns  have  made  significant  investments  in  urban  infrastructure,  few  have \n\n                                                 \n1   Liaoning Provincial Government. 2005.

Through the development of physical and social infrastructure, small cities and towns can \nattract investment and in-migration from rural areas, thereby playing a more significant role in the \nPRC\u2019s  drive  to  urbanize,  increase  economic  productivity,  and  distribute  the  benefits  of  economic \ngrowth  more  equitably.  Development  of  small  cities  and  towns  aims  to  attract  investment  and \ncreate  jobs  to  absorb  rural  migrants.  Increases  in  disposable  income  will  stimulate  domestic \ndemand and economic growth.3 \n \nThe revised criteria for an \u201cecologically sound province\u201d and an \u201cecologically sound city and \n5. \ncounty\u201d  announced  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  (then  the  State  Environmental \nProtection  Administration)  on  17  January  2008  give  balanced  emphasis  to  environmental \nprotection  and  economic  development,  illustrating  the  Government\u2019s  preference  for  sustainable \ndevelopment indicators to assess the performance of local governments and officials. The Chinese \nPublic\u2019s Environment and Inhabitant Livelihood Index 20074 shows that Chinese people are most \ndissatisfied  with  air  pollution,  with  25.8%  saying  they  are  very  concerned  with  air  quality. \nAwareness of the adverse effects of the PRC\u2019s unprecedented industrialization is increasing. The \ncountry  is  now  the  world\u2019s  second  biggest  emitter  of  greenhouse  gases  responsible  for  climate \nchange;  creating  negative  impacts  on  biodiversity,  livelihoods,  and  economic  development.  The \nGovernment  aims  to  integrate  economic  growth,  natural  resource  management,  and  climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation to achieve sustainable development. \n \nThe Liaoning Project is one of three small cities and towns development projects supported \n6. \nby the Government. The aim is to promote the development of selected small cities and towns in \nthe provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi in a way that can be replicated in other small cities \nand  towns  in  these  provinces  and  elsewhere  in  the  PRC.  The  three  provinces  were  selected \nfollowing the successful outcome of two ADB-financed TAs: the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy \nStudy  (footnote  2)  and  the  Hebei  Provincial  Development  Strategy.5 While  the  small  cities  and \ntowns  in  these  provinces  face  many  similar  problems  and  challenges,  they  also  have  different \ncharacteristics  in  terms  of  geographic  location  and  economy  that  offer  unique  opportunities  for \npromoting  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  Appendix  2  provides  a  sector  and  subsector \nanalysis. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nProject  Background.  Liaoning  Province,  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nnortheast,  functions  as a  hub  between  the  northeastern  and  the  Pan-Bohai  economic  regions.  In \n2007, its total population of 42.98 million comprised mainly Han, with 6.8 million ethnic minorities \n(16% of the total), who are mostly rural residents; those in urban areas are integrated into the Han \nculture. The urban population represented 59% of the total in 2007, and is expected to reach 63% \nby 2010. About 5.6% of the total urban population lived on incomes below the official poverty line, \ncompared with 3.8% nationally.6 Unemployment was 4.4% in 2007, slightly higher than the national \naverage  of  4.0%.  In  Kazuo,  one  of  the  subproject  towns,  unemployment  in  2007  was  33%. \nLiaoning  is  historically  a  base  for  industrial  materials  and  machinery  but  has  faced  economic \nchallenges related to an industrial restructuring process of state-owned heavy industries giving way \nto light (e.g., agriculture) and service (including tourism) industries. The aim is to promote balanced \neconomic development and focus on demand-driven growth instead of relying on exports. In 2006, \n                                                 \n3   This  is  in  line  with  the  latest  PRC  Government  incentive  to  stimulate  sustainable  growth  by  increasing  domestic \n\ndemand and decreasing reliance on exports. \n\n4  Released by the China Environmental Culture Promotion Association in January 2008. \n5  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Hebei  Provincial  Development  Strategy. \n\n6  At  the  end  of  2007,  1.41  million  urban  people  were  living  under  the  minimum  living  guarantee  in  Liaoning;  \n22.71 million in the whole of the PRC (website of Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC); Liaoning\u2019s total urban population \nwas 25.44 million; the PRC\u2019s was 593.79 million (website of National Bureau of Statistics of China). \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nthe total losses of Liaoning\u2019s loss-making enterprises amounted to CNY25 billion ($3.7 billion), the \nhighest  among  all  provinces  in  the  PRC.7 About  77%  of  state  industrial  firms  closed  down  from \n1996 to 2006. While state investment for fixed assets has aided the industrial transformation since \n2003,  the  recipients  are  mostly  large  cities.  While  the  number  of  private  enterprises,  including \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises increased by 20% during 2003\u20132007, most were established \nin  large  cities.  Small  city  and  town  governments  have  difficulty  catalyzing  new  employment  and \neconomic growth. \n \n8. \nSmall cities and towns in Liaoning Province have made substantial progress in recent years \nin  facilitating  economic  growth.  Some  resource-based  cities  and  towns  have  taken  advantage  of \nthe  growth  of  the  mining  and  metals  sectors;  and  some  located  within  metropolitan  areas  and \ndevelopment  corridors  have  become  manufacturing  centers, \ntransportation  hubs,  or \nagroprocessing  sites.  Others  have  benefited  from  multiplier  effects  through  growth  in  the  service \nsector. However, economic development of the counties still lags the big cities. In 2005, per capita \nGDP of all the counties in the province was CNY12,427\u201465% of the provincial GDP and 45% of \nthat  of  large  cities. 8  In  addition,  the  government-wide  priority  for  GDP  focused  on  industrial \ndevelopment over service sector growth, limiting the impact of investment in job creation. Also, the \nrapid  development  and  rush  to  urbanize  and  industrialize  have  left  many  cities  and  towns  with \nsignificant  atmospheric,  aquatic,  and  ground  pollution  and  poor  living  conditions,  threatening \nhuman  health  and  life  expectancy.  The  environments  of  small  cities  and  towns  have  been \nneglected  as  central  and  provincial  governments  have  historically  focused  on  larger  cities  and \nprovincial  capitals,  which  have  financial  capacity.  Thirty-three  percent  of  the  six  major  rivers \nmonitored by the Liaoning provincial government (LPG) in 2005 showed worse than class V CODCr \nstandard  and  67%  worse  than  class  V  NH3-N  standard, 9 indicative  of  impacts  from  domestic \nwastewater discharge. In Donggang City, one of the subproject cities, storm water and untreated \nwastewater  flow  into  Dadonggou  River  via  open  channels,  resulting  in  serious  water  quality \ndeterioration and siltation problems that threaten public health. Meanwhile, centralized heating has \nlimited coverage making the use of coal-burning stoves widespread. The major air pollutant in most \ncities is PM10,10 mainly from coal dust during the heating season. Urban population increases have \noutstripped  the  capacity  to  provide  services,  and  poor  asset  maintenance  has  compounded  the \nproblem. Public service providers are unable to manage sustainable operations, and restructuring \nis important to ensure viability and independence. Realigning skills to match the growing demand \nfor labor in secondary industries is also necessary. \n \nAs of 2005, 5.37 million people resided in 616 small cities and towns in Liaoning Province \n9. \n(footnote 1). While these cities and towns can serve as effective linkages between large cities and \nvillages, and between nonfarming and farming sectors, as well as absorb most of the surplus rural \nworkforce, their development has lagged larger cities. Infrastructure provision in most small cities \nand  towns  is  lacking  and  outdated.  Buildings  are  generally  of  low  standard.  Road  density  is  low, \nand  most  existing  roads  are  old  and  of  poor  quality.  Potable  water  coverage  is  only  39%.  Many \nwater  supply  facilities  are  aged,  network  coverage  is  low,  and  water  production  capability  is \ninadequate. Many drainage pipes and channels, used for 40 or more years, are resulting in severe \nbreakage  and  blockage.  Only  a  few  wastewater  treatment  plants  are  operating  and  no  sanitary \nlandfill  is  available  for  domestic  garbage,  which  is  either  disposed  of  in  the  open  or  buried \nunderground,  thus  polluting  water  resources.  Most  garbage  collection  vehicles  are  worn  out  and \ngarbage  collection  stations  are  few.11 Continuing  urbanization  highlights  the  inadequacy  of  road \n\n                                                 \n7  Liaoning Statistics Bureau. 2007.

In addition, \ncities  and  towns  face  pollution  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  from  garbage,  flooding,  and \nuntreated wastewater. \n \nIn  LPG\u2019s  January  2007  Work  Report,  the  provincial  governor  stated  that  LPG  would \n10. \ndevelop county seats and key towns, creating conditions favorable for a strategic shift of the rural \nlabor  force.  Development  of  cities  and  towns  would  be  integrated  with  economic  development  of \nthe counties and rural enterprises. Industrial projects and tertiary industries would be concentrated \nin  the  county  seats  and  key  towns  to  promote  prosperity.  LPG  is  bringing  about  sustainable \ninvestments  in  physical  and  environmental  infrastructure  for  coordinated  and  cost-effective \ndevelopment of small cities and towns. City and town governments are implementing elements of \nthe  master  plans  and  investing  in  roads,  water  supply,  heating,  and  environmental  improvement \nincluding garbage treatment, drainage, and connection of households to the wastewater network. \nThey  need  better  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  to  (i)  attract  investment,  especially  in \nemployment-intensive industries and services; (ii) provide a decent living environment for residents; \nand (iii) extend benefits of growth to all residents. \n \n11. \nProject  Rationale.  The Project is a response to Liaoning\u2019s 11FYP to promote sustainable \neconomic development, particularly in its small cities and towns, via construction and upgrading of \nroad infrastructure and water supply, and environmental improvement. It aims to promote balanced \nand environmentally sustainable urbanization; narrow the urban\u2013rural gap; and improve production, \nemployment,  and  living  conditions  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Liaoning  Province.  Developing \nmarkets and creating jobs by supporting urbanization and protecting the environment in small cities \nand towns are in line with ADB\u2019s strategic objective of promoting growth with equity in the PRC. All \ncomponents of the Project are integral features in the 11FYP. The core subprojects are Donggang \nCity, Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County, and Linghai City. The availability of viable projects in \nline  with  approved  master  plans,  the  potential  to  serve  as  models  for  subsequent  subprojects \nduring  sector  loan  implementation,  and  the  preparedness  to  undertake  investments  in  municipal \ninfrastructure are some of the considerations in the selection of the core subprojects. Selection of \nsubsequent subprojects will be based, among other factors, on their potential to grow economically \nand provide jobs for rural migrants. Employment growth will contribute more to the Government\u2019s \ngoal  of  closing  the  urban\u2013rural  income  gap  than  production  growth.  The  subprojects  focus  on \ntownwide primary and secondary infrastructure, with emphasis on environmental infrastructure. \n \n12. \nA key development strategy of Liaoning, called \u201c5 points along one line,\u201d incorporates five \nkey  industrial  areas  along  a  coastal  strip  and  a  new  highway  that  will  connect  the  cities.  The \nconcept aims to capitalize on Liaoning\u2019s resources and manufacturing ability to bring new growth. \nDonggang  City,  a  strategically  located  port  city  with  a  harbor  near  the  national  border,  is  an \ninternational trading hub and distribution center within the easternmost \u201cpoint\u201d and will become an \nimportant gateway to attract investment to and drive large-scale development of the poorer eastern \ninterior  region  of  the  province.  Its  development  will  have  a  demonstration  effect  on  many  similar \nsmall cities also with substantial fishing and agricultural populations. Linghai City is a coastal city \nalong  the  transport  corridor  between  the  northeastern  provinces  and  the  Pan-Bohai  economic \nregion. It has an agricultural, fisheries, and food crop base, with recent growth in light industries, \nclothing, agroprocessing, and mechanical and electrical equipment manufacturing. It has potential \nto  drive  the  development  of  a  large  area.  Kazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County  is  an  inland \ncounty representative of the poor western part of Liaoning. Improved infrastructure will serve poor \nvillages and a growing industrial district that is close to abundant mineral resources and transport \nlines, but presently constrained by water shortage. \n \nKey  issues  in  the  subproject  cities  and  towns  are  (i)  inadequacy  of  infrastructure,  \n13. \n(ii) severe air and/or water pollution, (iii) significant share of the population living under the poverty \nline, and (iv) lack of integrated and coordinated planning and management of the development of \nvarious  infrastructure  sectors.  The  Project  will  address  these  issues  through  several  sector \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nand \n\nand \n\npipe \n\nlines; \n\nsafety \n\npower \n\nfacilities; \n\ncommunication \n\ninterventions  such  as  support  for  job  creation,  economic  growth,  environmental  protection, \nimprovement of infrastructure, and industrial development. Different cities and towns will promote \ndifferent  sectors,  depending  on  their  base  and  their  development  potential  and  needs.  The  main \nsectors are roads and associated municipal services such as (i) street lights; traffic signs, signals, \nand \nnetwork;  \n(ii) water and wastewater; (iii) solid waste management; (iv) upgrading and greening of rivers; and \n(v)  district  heating.  The  subprojects  involve  (i)  construction  of  new  roads  focusing  on  town \nbypasses,  upgrading  inadequate  or  unsurfaced  roads,  and  improving  traffic  planning  and \nmanagement;  (ii)  increase  in  the  capacity  to  supply  potable  water  and  coverage  of  distribution \nnetworks,  and  provision  of  sewerage  systems  with  associated  treatment  facilities;  (iii)  river \nimprovement  and  area upgrading  works  to  reduce  the  risk of  seasonal  flooding  and  increase  the \ncapacity  to  impound  water  for  various  uses;  (iv)  provision  of  modern  solid  waste  collection \nequipment, development of engineered waste disposal sites, and strengthening of management of \noperations;  and  (v)  provision  of  centralized  heating  plants  and  associated  distribution  networks. \nThe  Project  includes  measures  to  strengthen  environmental  management  in  the  subproject  cities \nand  towns.  It  incorporates  approaches  and  solutions  to  problems  that  can  be  replicated  in  urban \ncenters throughout Liaoning Province and be demonstrated to other provinces wishing to formulate \nplanning strategies and implement programs to support the structured development of small cities \nand  towns.  The  Project  uses  a  participatory  approach,  where  city  and  town  stakeholders  identify \nmajor  urban  problems  and  highlight  actions  to  address  those  problems.  The  subprojects  will \ndirectly support the actions. Supplementary Appendix C provides a sector policy framework. \n \nThe  Project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC, 12  which \n14. \nincludes  foci  on  managing  the  environment,  catalyzing  investment,  and  improving  governance. \nADB\u2019s  experience  and  knowledge  in  urban  environmental  improvement  and  management, \nincluding support for utility tariff reforms, will add value to the Project, especially in small cities and \ntowns  undergoing  urbanization  and  economic  transformation.  The  Project  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s \nWater  Policy 13  and  Water  Financing  Program, 14  both  of  which  seek  to  improve  urban  water \ninvestments  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  investments  in  water  supply,  sanitation, \nwastewater management, and environmental improvement. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector \nstrategy,  which  supports  infrastructure  investment  in  settlements  that  are  dynamic  engines  of \neconomic  growth  and  employment  creation,  innovation,  entrepreneurship,  and  social  services \nprovision. The Project will have a positive impact on the living environment of residents, including \nthe  poor,  through  improved  roads  and  traffic  safety  and  management,  water  supply,  wastewater \ntreatment,  solid  waste  management,  district  heating,  and  river  rehabilitation.  It  also  indirectly \nsupports  ADB\u2019s  various  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  climate  change  initiatives15 by \nimproving  the  transportation  network  and  connectivity,  as  well  as  traffic  management,  thus \nreducing  vehicle  emissions  per  trip,  enhancing  water  resources  management,  and  protecting \ncoastal cities by constructing dikes. \n \n15. \nSector  Lending  Approach.  The  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  the  Liaoning  11FYP \nand Liaoning Small City and Town Framework Plan (2003\u20132020), which highlight the promotion of \nsmall  city  and  town  development  to  support  economically,  socially,  and  environmentally \nsustainable  urbanization.  LPG  plans  to  use  the  ADB  loan  to  support  investment  in  about  seven \nsmall  cities  and  towns  in  the  province.  In  view  of  the  varying  degree  of  preparedness  of \nsubprojects  to  be  included  in  the  Project,  and  the  possibility  that  some  of  the  subprojects  may \nchange  during  project  implementation,  the  PRC  Government  agrees  that  the  ADB  sector  loan \nmodality, which allows for greater flexibility during project implementation, is appropriate. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008.

LPG \nhas  met  the  conditions  and  developed  subproject  identification,  selection,  and  appraisal  criteria \nand procedures to ensure that the Project will facilitate achieving the objectives of sector policies \nand  plans. Appendix  3 shows  the process  of  subproject identification, selection,  preparation,  and \nappraisal. Supplementary Appendix B shows the summary appraisal criteria and report template. \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  further  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on  \n17. \n(i) integrated urban planning and infrastructure development for subregional cities and towns that \nwill  promote  equitable  economic  growth  and  capacity  building;  (ii)  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement; (iii) managerial, technical, and financial sustainability of utility service operations; (iv) \ngovernance and anticorruption; and (v) participatory approach to project design. \n \n18. \nThe Project will help small city and town governments integrate planning and development \nof subregions on the sectors covered. Efficient and equitable targeting of resources to small cities \nand towns can reduce environmental degradation in large cities, support employment generation, \nand contribute to urban and rural poverty reduction. Most subproject cities and towns have limited \nor  no  previous  involvement  in  foreign-financed  infrastructure  projects.  Their  project  management \ncapacity  and  professional  skills  for  planning  and  infrastructure  delivery  are  much  less  developed \ncompared  with  municipal-level  cities.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services,  training,  and \nexposure  to  best  practices  in  project  management  and  implementation  support,  urban  and  traffic \nplanning  and  management,  infrastructure  development,  institutional  improvement,  financial \nmanagement,  utility  operations,  tariff  setting,  billing,  and  management  of  operations  with  special \nfocus on human resource development. \n \n19. \nTo  achieve  sustainable  growth,  development  must  be  balanced  with  social  and \nenvironmental concerns. The Project will introduce measures to prevent and control pollution, and \nensure  environmentally  sustainable  growth \nthrough  proper  environmental  planning  and \nmanagement.  It  will  include  training  on  environmental  awareness  and  the  environmental \nmanagement system. Most of Liaoning, in particular the western part, is water scarce. The Project \nwill include programs for both supply- and demand-side water management, including the analysis \nof  long-term  water  balance  and  planning  horizons  for  domestic,  industrial,  and  agricultural  uses; \nwater  conservation  education;  water  source  protection;  pollution  control  and  prevention; \nwastewater  reuse;  restrictions  of  groundwater  use;  and  treatment  of  effluent  to  an  acceptable \ndischarge  standard.  For  the  Donggang,  Linghai,  and  subsequent  subprojects  that  have  road \ncomponents  with  associated  services,  the  Project  will  include  training  on  traffic  and  road \nmanagement, road safety, and wastewater management. \n \n20. \nimplementing  agencies  are  currently  government  agencies,  but  state-owned \nenterprises  may  assume  operations  of  some  of  the  project  facilities.  ADB  supports  corporate \ngovernance reform, namely, (i) structuring enterprises along commercial lines, providing assistance \nin  preparing  business  plans,  and  strengthening  operation  of  the  board  of  directors  and \naccountability \ninternal  audit \narrangements; and (iii) reforming tariffs to improve cost recovery. The Project will support LPG and \nthe  implementing  agencies  to  reform  tariffs  to  reflect  a  clear  policy  on  cost  recovery,  and  use \n\nthrough  supervisory  boards;  (ii) \n\nimplementing  external  and \n\nThe \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  the  PRC  on  updating  its  urbanization  policies  and  strategies.  Recent  studies  include  the \nTown-Based  Urbanization  Strategy  Study  (TA  4335-PRC,  footnote  2)  and  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  on  the \nStudy on Sustainable Urbanization in Metropolitan Regions. Manila (TA 4702-PRC). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\naccounting systems in accordance with international practice. The water tariff reform program can \nbe  implemented  gradually  to  discourage  wastage,  with  initial  tariffs  to  pay  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs,  eventually  reaching  full  cost  recovery.  For  government  agencies \nimplementing  nonrevenue-earning  components,  ADB  encourages  strengthening  the  organization \nstructure to improve service delivery; supervision and monitoring, including checks and balances; \nand effective allocation of resources for implementing and operating infrastructure. \n \n21. \nADB  is  fully  committed  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency.  Bidders, \nsuppliers,  and  contractors  must  observe  the  highest  ethical  standards  for  the  procurement  and \nexecution  of  ADB-financed  contracts.  Sanctions  will  apply  if  fraud  and  corruption  in  procurement \nare  discovered.  Measures  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010),  which  includes  a  goal  of  promoting  good  governance  through \nsupport  for  reform  and  capacity  development  in  corporate  governance.  LPG  and  all  subproject \ngovernments are recommended to consider involving full-time officials from discipline investigation \nbureaus and audit departments in bidding and construction to enhance construction quality control \nand  supervision,  and  in  consultation  with  relevant  central  government  ministries,  updating  rules \nand  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance,  anticorruption,  and  enhancement  of \ntransparency of the implementing agencies\u2019 operations. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  is  formulated  to  take  into  consideration  and  incorporate  in  the  project  design \ncomments  and  ideas  from  various  levels  of  government,  beneficiaries,  and  affected  people \nincluding  vulnerable  groups,  through  stakeholder  meetings,  focus  group  discussions,  informant \ninterviews, and household surveys. This ensures local participation and involvement in subproject \nidentification  and  implementation,  and  O&M  of  improved  infrastructure.  A  design  and  monitoring \nframework  is  created  and  refined  in  the  process.  For  future  urban  projects,  the  Liaoning  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  subproject  governments  can  use  the  knowledge  and  experience \nfrom this participatory approach to guide their interventions. \n \n23. \nExternal  Assistance.  Since  1992,  ADB  has  provided  29  loans  totaling  more  than  \n$3.7 billion to the PRC for urban environmental improvement and infrastructure projects, and $57 \nmillion  for  80  TA  studies  to  prepare  these  projects  and  study  key  issues  in  environmental \nimprovement  and  infrastructure.  The  Project  is  based  on  the  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy \nStudy TA, which recommends measures to facilitate development of small cities and towns. ADB \nand the World Bank have provided external assistance for infrastructure development in large and \nmedium-sized cities of Liaoning Province. Appendix 4 provides details of the external assistance. \n \n24. \nLessons.  Lessons from ADB and LPG experience in urban development projects include \n(i) strategic master plans play an important role in providing a comprehensive framework for urban \ndevelopment  and  environmental  management;  (ii)  public  awareness  and  education  are  important \nfor environmental improvement; therefore public consultation, involvement, and awareness training \non environmental health and protection should be provided; (iii) an effective internal and external \nmonitoring mechanism for resettlement implementation is important for effective coordination and \ntimely  implementation  of  land  approval,  compensation,  and rehabilitation  measures.  The  relevant \nlessons are incorporated in the project design. \n \n25. \nExperience  in  the  PRC\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  sector  indicates  that  projects  are  well-\nplanned  and  implemented,  and  tariffs  are  increased  as  required.  Willingness-to-pay  analysis \nindicates  that  consumers  are  willing  to  pay  substantially  higher  prices  for  water,  and  to  a  certain \nextent, wastewater treatment. Issues related to tariffs, cost recovery, and commercial orientation of \nwater  utilities  are  addressed  during  project  preparation.  Lessons  from  previous  projects  are \nreflected  in  the  project  design,  including  (i)  focus  on  institutional  strengthening  to  improve \ncorporate  governance,  (ii)  improved  provincial  coordination,  and  (iii)  financial  and  institutional \narrangements for proper O&M. \n \n\n \n\n\f(i)  comprehensive  and  participatory  approaches \n\n26. \nLessons  from  ADB  and  World  Bank  experience  in  urban  transport  projects  highlight  the \nto  project  preparation;  \nimportance  of \n(ii)  adequate  consultation  with  those  affected  preceding  a  planned  and  well-coordinated \nresettlement scheme; (iii) professional approach to traffic demand forecasts; (iv) attention to public \ntransport,  traffic  management,  road  safety,  vehicle  emission  control,  and  road  maintenance  to \ncomplement investment in urban roads; and (v) participation and coordination of all agencies with \nresponsibilities for urban transport. These lessons were considered in the project design. \n \n27. \nthe  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy  Study  TA  were \nincorporated in the project design, especially in subproject selection, namely, (i) town development \nshould  be  conceived  and  implemented  as  part  of  the  development  of  metropolitan  areas, \ndevelopment  corridors,  and  other  subregions;  and  (ii)  towns  should  be  targeted  for  development \nbased on their potential for economic growth and job creation. \n \n\nThe  recommendations  of \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n28. \nThe  impacts  of  the  Project  are  improved  living  conditions  and  increased  employment \ngeneration in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. The project outcome is improved urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in about seven small cities and towns in Liaoning.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29. \nThe  Project  includes  about  seven  subproject  cities  and  towns.  Detailed  assessment  and \nanalyses were undertaken for the three core subprojects: (i) Donggang City, (ii) Kazuo Mongolian \nAutonomous  County,  and  (iii)  Linghai  City.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  shows  the  indicative \ncandidate subsequent subprojects. \n \n30. \nThe  Donggang  City  subproject  has  three  components:  (i)  roads,  bridge,  and  associated \nmunicipal  services;  (ii)  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment;  and  (iii)  river  improvement  and  area \nupgrading. Component (i) will construct a new trunk road, reconstruct two trunk roads, construct a \nbridge, and install road lights including transformers. Component (ii) will install storm-water pipes \nand wastewater pipes, construct storm-water pumping stations and wastewater pumping stations, \nand install a box culvert. Component (iii) will construct embankment dikes along Dadonggou River \nincluding  planting  1.1  million  square  meters  (m2)  of  landscaped  area  along  the  embankment. \nSupplementary Appendix E provides technical details of this subproject. \n \nThe  Kazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County  subproject  has  one  water  supply  component \n31. \nthat  will  construct  a  water  intake  including  a  lifting  pumping  station  with  26,000  cubic  meters  per \nday  (m3/d)  capacity  and  a  primary  sedimentation  tank,  an  intermediate  pumping  station  with  a \ncapacity  of  26,000  m3/d,  and  a  water  treatment  plant  with  a  capacity  of  25,000  m3/d;  and  install \nwater  transmission  pipes  and  water  distribution  pipes.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  provides \ntechnical details of this subproject. \n \n32. \nThe  Linghai  City  subproject  has  one  component  for  construction  and  upgrading  of  roads \nand  associated  municipal  services.  It  will  construct  a  series  of  roads  (two  upgraded  trunk  roads, \neight upgraded secondary roads, and one upgraded branch road), a water pumping station, and a \nwater storage tank with a volume of 2,000 m3; landscape 150,000 m2 of land along the new and \nupgraded roads; install road lights with transformers, storm-water pipes, and box culverts; lay water \nsupply  pipes;  and  procure  road  maintenance  equipment.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides \ntechnical details of this subproject. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n33. \nThe  Project  also  provides  for  institutional  development  and  capacity-building  measures  in \nsmall  city  and  town  development,  municipal  infrastructure,  and  environmental  management  and \npolicy  reforms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  Project  and  related  facilities.  The  Project  is  the  first \nADB  sector  loan  for  the  Liaoning  PMO.  The  subproject  cities  and  towns  have  limited  experience \nwith internationally funded projects and are not familiar with ADB procedures and international best \npractices,  hence  training  is  needed  to  develop  and  strengthen  institutions  that  will  implement  the \nsubprojects  and  operate  the  project  facilities  so  they  will  be  sustainable  from  an  operation  and \nfinancial perspective. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n34. \nThe  development  of  the  Project  was  directly  supported  by  ADB-financed  advisory  policy \nand strategy studies. The underlying technical approach for the Project is based on the findings of \na  successfully  completed  advisory  TA  on  town-based  urbanization  strategy  with  Liaoning  and \nShanxi as case study provinces, a provincial development strategy study for Hebei Province, and \ngovernment policies and plans for small city and town development. These studies highlighted an \nopportunity  for  ADB  to  support  the  PRC\u2019s  rural\u2013urban  integration  policy  by  strengthening  the \ncapacity of small cities and towns to deliver basic urban infrastructure. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  supports  rural\u2013urban  integration  in  promoting  the  growth  of  small  cities  and \ntowns with various economic functions and infrastructure needs, while incorporating environmental \nand social considerations in planning and development. This will demonstrate to similar cities and \ntowns  in  Liaoning  and  other  provinces  how  they  can  achieve  economically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  urban  development;  as  well  as  achieve  greater  integration  with  rural \nareas and large cities. The Liaoning PMO will ensure that lessons identified by project cities and \ntowns  are  disseminated  to  nonproject  cities  and  towns  through  seminars,  field  visits,  promotional \nmaterials,  and/or  the  media.  ADB  will  also  support  dissemination  and  sharing  of  lessons  by \nfinancing  seminars:  (i)  provincial  seminars  to  demonstrate  how  the  advisory  TA  strategy  is \noperationalized  through  the  different  subprojects  and  their  components,  and  (ii)  national  and \ninternational seminars to showcase innovative features in the approach of this sector project and \nthose  in  Shanxi  and  Hebei  in  preparing  and  implementing  sustainable  small  city  and  town \ndevelopment projects. \n \n36. \nThe ADB Water Financing Partnership Facility will provide a $250,000 grant for this Project \nto  strengthen  financial  and  operating  management  and  corporate  governance  of  water  and \nwastewater  agencies  and  companies  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Liaoning  for  them  to  become \ncommercially viable entities.17 Appendix 5 provides a summary of the support and Supplementary \nAppendix H is a brief description of the grant. \n \n37. \nThe project design follows a planned approach. Identification of long-term planning needs \nand design of the subprojects are based on (i) growth strategies and provincial, city, county, and \ntown  development  master  plans;  and  (ii)  the  principle  of  integrating  provision  of  various \ninfrastructure services to maximize benefits from individual sector improvements. Improved access \nto production factors, inputs, markets, and market information is a driving force of pro-poor growth. \nThe  Donggang  and  Linghai  subprojects  will  upgrade  the  road  network,  which  carries  associated \nservices such as water supply and wastewater pipes; thus extending and improving environmental \ninfrastructure for built-up areas, as well as facilitating pedestrian and cargo transport including job \ncreation for rural residents and for the sale of agricultural produce. \n \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB is providing TA to the PRC to strengthen urban wastewater and solid waste management, including tariff reform, \nin small cities and towns (ADB. 2007.

The \nloan,  which  will  finance  42.3%  of  the  project  cost  will  cover  civil  works,  equipment  and  supplies, \nproject consulting services and training, and financing charges on the loan during construction. The \nGovernment will finance contingencies. Donggang city government, Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous \ncounty government, and Linghai city government will provide counterpart funding through tax and \nnontax  revenues,  for  which  they  have  provided  commitment  letters.  The  Water  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  will  provide  a  grant  of  $250,000  to  be  administered  by  LPG  for  supporting \ninstitutional and financial management capacity development of water and wastewater entities. The \nfinancing  plan  for  the  Project  is  summarized  in  Table  2,  with  details  provided  in  Appendix  6  and \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \nThe PRC is the Borrower of the loan.

The  Provincial  Project  Coordination  Group,  comprising  the  Liaoning \nFinance  Bureau,  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Construction  Bureau,  Land  Resources \nBureau,  Audit  Bureau,  Price  Bureau,  and  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  will  provide  overall \nguidance, supervision, and support to project preparation and implementation. The Liaoning PMO19 \nwas  established  to  undertake  and  manage  day-to-day  project  activities,  including  selection  and \nappraisal of subsequent subprojects. In each subproject city and town, a PMO was set up to liaise \nwith the Liaoning PMO and departments and bureaus concerned, and to oversee and manage (i) \nwork  undertaken  by \nfinance,  and  \n(iii)  project  implementation.

The subprojects are selected in accordance with \nthe  following  criteria:  (i)  confirmation  by  the  local  government  of  its  ability  and  willingness  to \narrange  counterpart  financing  and  comply  with  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  other  requirements;  \n(ii)  confirmation  by  the  concerned  local  government  on  its  willingness  to  comply  with  ADB \nsafeguard  policies  and  other  requirements;  (iii)  implementation  of  the  subproject  will  be  within \n2009\u20132015;  (iv)  eligibility  of  the  components  (roads  and  associated  services,  water  supply, \nwastewater management, river improvement, solid waste management, and district heating); and \n\n                                                 \n19 The Liaoning PMO is called the Liaoning Urban Construction and Renewal Project Office. \n\n \n\n\f(v)  anticipated  positive  impact  on  the  urban  environment,  employment  generation,  economic \ngrowth, and coverage or service level of infrastructure and municipal services. \n \n44. \nSubproject  Preparation.  The  participating  city  or  county  government  and  implementing \nagency  will,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Liaoning  Development  and  Reform  Commission  and  with \nthe  help  of  the  Liaoning  PMO,  prepare  project  design  documents  including  a  project  proposal, \nfeasibility  study,  and  preliminary  engineering  design  for  the  components  of  the  proposed \nsubproject  in  accordance  with  the  national  project  investment  specifications.  The  project  design \ndocuments will cover subproject rationale; scope; components; technical analysis; cost estimates; \nfinancing  plan;  implementation  arrangements;  financial  management  assessment;  and  financial, \neconomic,  social,  and  institutional  analyses.  These  documents  will  be  submitted  to  the  Liaoning \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  for  approval.  The  participating  city  or  county  government \nwill  also  prepare  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  a  resettlement  plan  to  be \nsubmitted to the concerned provincial departments and bureaus for approval. \n \n45. \nSubproject Appraisal and Approval. The Liaoning PMO will be responsible for review of \nthe subprojects in accordance with criteria agreed to by the Government and ADB. The subproject \nPMO  will  prepare  a  subproject  appraisal  report,  which  will  follow  the  template  in  the  project \npreparatory  TA  final  report,  and  submit  the  appraisal  report  to  the  municipal  finance  bureau  for \nreview  and  then  to  the  Liaoning  PMO  for  further  review.  The  Liaoning  PMO  will  submit  the \nsubproject appraisal report to the Liaoning Finance Bureau and Liaoning Development and Reform \nCommission for endorsement before submitting it to ADB for review and approval. \n \n46. \nSubsequent subprojects will receive the same extent of environmental safeguard scrutiny, \nmodeled  on  the  EIAs  for  the  three  core  subprojects  and  the  summary  EIA  (SEIA).  The  Liaoning \nPMO  will  submit  the  EIAs  to  ADB  for  review,  after  which  the  revised  EIAs  will  be  posted  on  the \nADB website. An environmental assessment and management framework was prepared to assess \nsubsequent  subprojects.  For  other  safeguard  concerns,  a  resettlement  framework  and  an  ethnic \nminority  development  framework  were  prepared  for  subsequent  subprojects.  Draft  resettlement \nplans will be prepared using core subproject resettlement plans as models. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n47. \nSince this is the first sector project for LPG, selection and appraisal of the initial one or two \nsubsequent  subprojects  may  take  additional  time  to  meet  ADB  and  domestic  requirements.  To \nallow  for  more  flexibility  for  LPG  to  select  subsequent  subprojects  to  meet  the  various  pace  of \ndevelopment of small cities and towns, the Project will be implemented over 6 years from late 2009 \nto late 2015 (Appendix 9). \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n48. \nGoods,  works,  and  services  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Preliminary  contract \npackages  were  formulated  in  consultation  with  the  implementing  agencies,  and  a  procurement \ncapacity  assessment  of  LPG,  the  PMOs,  and  the  implementing  agencies  was  undertaken \n(Supplementary  Appendix  K).  Results  of  the  procurement  capacity  assessment  indicate  that  the \nLiaoning  PMO  has  the  capacity  and  experience  to  carry  out  advance  procurement.  Contracts  for \ngoods estimated to cost $1 million or more and contracts for works estimated to cost $10 million or \nmore will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and \nworks estimated to cost less than these international competitive bidding thresholds but more than \n$100,000 will be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding procedures in accordance \nwith the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, subject to modifications and clarifications agreed to with \nADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using \nshopping  procedures.  Prior  review  will  be  adopted  for  all  international  competitive  bidding \npackages and the first national competitive bidding package. More details of the procurement plan \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nare provided in Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n49. \nThe Project will provide funding for about 154 person-months of international and national \nconsulting  services  to  support  the  Liaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  in \nproject implementation and management, and institutional capacity building. A consulting firm will \nbe engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) using the standard quality- and cost-based selection method (80% quality and \n20%  cost)  and  simplified  technical  proposal.  The  consulting  services  will  cover  (i)  support  of  the \nLiaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and \nin  project  preparation  and \nmanagement  including  procurement,  (ii)  development  of  the  project  performance  management \nsystem  (PPMS),  (iii)  financial  management  including  ADB  disbursement  and  imprest  account \nprocedures,  (iv)  social  and  environmental  support,  (v)  O&M,  and  (vi)  institutional  strengthening. \nCapacity  building  for  the  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  achieved  through  consultant \ninputs; training courses provided by universities, specialized institutes, and firms; in-country and/or \ninternational study visits; and acquisition of additional equipment financed from the loan. To assist \nthe PMOs and implementing agencies in expediting project implementation, another consulting firm \nwill be engaged using the consultants\u2019 qualification selection method to prepare several contracts \nfor advance contracting and design review, and construction supervision for half a year, prior to the \nrecruitment  of  the  consulting  firm  for  the  majority  of  the  consulting  services.  The outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n\nimplementing  agencies \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n50. \nADB has approved the Government's request for advance contracting for the recruitment of \nconsultants,  training,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works;  and  retroactive  financing  of \neligible  expenditures  up  to  $20  million  (equivalent  to  20% of  the  ADB  loan),  incurred  before  loan \neffectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement.20 Advance \ncontracting  will  include  (i)  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil \nworks  packages;  (ii)  preparation  of  tender  documents  to  procure  materials  and  equipment;  (iii) \nevaluation  of  bids;  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  consultants.  All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting \nand  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  Government,  LPG,  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \n51. \nwith  LPG,  the  PMOs,  and  the  implementing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  This  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nPRC  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010),  which  includes  the  goal  to  promote  good \ngovernance  through  supporting  reform  and  capacity  development  in  corporate  governance.  LPG \n\n                                                 \n20 The advance action on the  procurement and recruitment of  consultants, and the  posting of the general procurement \nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB Management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing at the Management review meeting on 20 November 2008. \n\n \n\n\fhas  indicated  its  commitment  to  fight  corruption  and  a  number  of  anticorruption  actions  are \nincluded as covenants in the loan and project agreements. 21 Under these covenants, LPG will \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ninvolve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  each  implementing  agency  in \nbidding  and  construction  to  monitor  construction  quality  control  and  supervise \neffective work; \nintroduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also signs \nan anticorruption agreement with the implementing agency; \nperiodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; and \nengage the loan implementation consultant to support the Liaoning and subproject \nPMOs  and  the  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  good  governance,  accountability, \nand transparency in project operations. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n52. \nThe  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project  implementation  through \ntimely release of loan proceeds, the Liaoning Finance Bureau  will establish one imprest account \npromptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.22 This imprest account \nestablished in the provincial finance bureau will be responsible for all withdrawal applications from \nmunicipalities and counties. Disbursements from the imprest account to the implementing agencies \nwill be based on actual expenditures with full supporting documents, which is in line with Ministry of \nFinance  internal  regulations.  Withdrawal  applications  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that \nthe  goods  and/or  services  were  produced  in  or  from  ADB  members,  and  are  eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing.  The  maximum  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  ADB\u2019s \nestimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the \nnext  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest account and reimbursement \nof  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment.  No  withdrawal  will  be \nmade from the loan account for subprojects in which one or more of the implementing agencies are \nlegally registered companies until the following condition has been met: the Ministry of Finance has \nsubmitted  to  ADB  the  certification  that  (i)  the  subproject  government  and  the  company  have \ncompleted an onlending agreement, and (ii) such onlending agreement contains the same financial \nterms  and  conditions  and  other  obligations  as  required  in  the  loan  agreement.  The  Liaoning \nFinance  Bureau  will  set  up  a  separate  bank  account  for  the  $250,000  grant  from  the  Water \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  to  be  used  for  engaging  consultants,  and  conducting  training \nprograms and workshops. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n53. \nThe  Liaoning  PMO  will  coordinate  with  subproject  PMOs  to  prepare  semiannual  progress \nreports indicating (i) progress made, (ii) problems encountered during the review period, (iii) steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  (iv)  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  (v) \nprogress expected in the next 6 months. The implementing agencies will keep records to allow the \nidentification  of  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  following  accounting \nprinciples  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC.  This  law  requires  that \nfinancial statements generally follow recognized accounting standards. The implementing agencies \nwill  set  up  and  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records.  The  financial  statements  of  the \nproject accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for implementing agencies will be \nsubject  to  external  audit  by  the  audit  bureau  of  the  city  or  county  concerned,  LPG  audit  bureau, \n\n                                                 \n21  In line with ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132010): People\u2019s Republic of China (footnote 12), which includes \n\na goal of promoting good governance. \n\n22  Bank charges on the imprest account will be financed from the ADB loan. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nand  the  state  audit  bureau.  The  audits  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  audit \nregulations  and  must  meet  ADB  requirements.  A  separate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the \nimprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The implementing \nagencies\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  audited  project  accounts  will  be  submitted  to \nADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year throughout the implementation period. \nLPG and the implementing agencies will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use \nof  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  implementing  agency  performance.  These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports, (ii) annual reports, and (iii) a project completion \nreport not later than 3 months after project completion. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n54. \nThe PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were discussed with the \nLiaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  preparation.  The \nindicators  are  based  on  the  monitoring  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding  (i)  job  creation;  (ii)  service  levels;  (iii)  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  solid  waste \ncollection  coverage,  and  other  operating  performance  measures;  (iv)  water  quality;  (v)  relevant \nsocial and economic data; (vi) traffic conditions; and (vii) air quality indicators. At the start of project \nimplementation,  the  Liaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies,  with  the \nassistance  of  the  loan  implementation  consultant,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures \nto generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the components, as well as indicators \nto be used to measure project impact. The Liaoning and subproject PMOs will (i) refine the PPMS, \n(ii)  confirm  achievable  targets,  (iii)  finalize  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv) \nestablish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n55. \nIn  addition  to  joint  project  reviews  carried  out  at  least  once  a  year,  ADB,  LPG,  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  2  years  after  the  start  of \nproject  implementation.  This  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n56. \nSocial Aspects. The poverty and social assessment identifies key areas where the Project \nwill  benefit  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  removing \ninfrastructure  constraints,  improving  the  condition  of  drinking  water,  addressing  environmental \nconcerns, and promoting sustainable economic growth in seven small cities and towns of Liaoning \nProvince.  Provision  of  water  supply  in  Kazuo  will  have  quantifiable  impacts  on  public  health  in \nterms  of  savings  made  on  medical  consultations  and  purchase  of  medicines  (the  health  impact \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix N). This will also reduce domestic work (largely undertaken \nby women), such as fetching and disposal of water; cleaning; and caring for children, the sick, and \nthe  elderly.  Women  will  greatly  benefit  from  improvements  in  the  living  environment  as  they  are \nprimarily  responsible  for  household  chores.  Jobs  created  through  the  Project  during  facility \nconstruction  and  operation  will  attract  surplus  rural  labor  to  urban  areas  and  address \nunemployment,  expediting  urbanization,  with  the  additional  benefits  of  providing  new  skills  to \nworkers  and  stimulating  various  secondary  industries.  Women  in  the  subproject  cities  and  towns \nwill also benefit from future employment due in part to project interventions to stimulate economic \nactivity. A labor reemployment framework is in Supplementary Appendix O. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  260,000  people  residing  in  the  three  core  subproject  cities  and \n57. \ntowns,  as  well  as  residents  in  four  subsequent  subproject  cities  and  towns  with  a  total  urban \npopulation  of  about  660,000.  Half  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  women.  The  percentage  of  poor \namong  the  beneficiaries  in  subproject  areas  is  9.0%  in  Kazuo,  4.5%  in  Linghai,  and  3.5%  in \n\n \n\n\fthrough \n\nimprovement  of  public  health \n\nDonggang.  Key  socioeconomic  impacts  of  core  subprojects  include  (i)  creation  of  jobs  and \ninfrastructure  and \nemployment  opportunities;  (ii) \nenvironmental  improvement;  (iii)  environmental  protection  through  improvement  of  the  sewage \ncollection system and flood control; (iv) mobility, access, and affordability of key basic services and \ndestinations  through  road  construction;  and  (v)  provision  of  skills  training.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11; details of the poverty and social assessment and \nthe social action plan are in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n58. \nEthnic  minorities  in  core  subproject  areas  account  for  3%  of  the  population  and  have \nsocioeconomic characteristics similar to those of Han people. Although their culture and language \nare different from the Han\u2019s, they mostly speak Han language and intermarriage with other ethnic \ngroups,  particularly  the  Hans,  is  common.  On  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the  socioeconomic \nsurvey, focus group discussions, and consultation in the core subproject areas, an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan is not needed. In line with the requirement of the sector loan modality, an ethnic \nminority  development  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  Q)  was  prepared  for  subsequent \nsubprojects. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  resettlement.  On  the  basis  of  project  impact \n59. \ninvestigation  in  the  feasibility  study  reports,  the  Donggang  subproject  will  necessitate  relatively \nlarge amounts of land acquisition and resettlement: 25.7 hectares [ha]) of land and 194 households \nor  715  people  from  seven  villages  in  three  towns.  A  total  of  11,174  m2  of  structures  will  be \ndemolished,  including  7,645  m2  of  residential  structures,  affecting  91  households  or  336  people; \nand  3,529  m2  of  nonresidential  structures,  affecting  eight  enterprises  and  61  shops  with  225 \nemployees.  A  full  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  based  on  ADB  procedures.  The  Kazuo \nsubproject will involve permanent land acquisition of 1.5 ha of farmland from three villages, which \nwill  affect  12  households  and  52  people.  During  pipeline  construction,  a  total  7.6  ha  will  be \ntemporarily occupied. No house demolition and relocation is required. Consequently, resettlement \nimpacts are slight and a short resettlement plan for the Kazuo subproject was prepared. The road \nand pumping station component of the Linghai subproject will be constructed either on the existing \nright-of-way or on the land area acquired in 2007. Therefore, only a due diligence report is required \nfor  the  Linghai  subproject.  The  subproject  governments  endorsed  the  resettlement  plans,  which \nwere  disclosed  to  those  affected  in  mid-October  2008.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in \nAppendix  12.  To  assess  the  resettlement  aspects  of  subsequent  subprojects,  a  resettlement \nframework (Supplementary Appendix R) was prepared. \n \n60. \nFinancial  Aspects.  Financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  revenue-generating  Kazuo \nwater  supply  component.  Financial  sustainability  analysis  was  completed  for  the  nonrevenue-\ngenerating  roads  and  river  improvement  components.  Financial  management  assessments \ncomprised LPG and the implementing agencies. A summary financial analysis is in Appendix 13, \nand details are in Supplementary Appendix S. \n \n61. \nThe financial internal rate of return for the Kazuo water supply component is computed at \n6.1%,  comparing  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.2%.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital even if costs and revenues change adversely by 10%. \n \n62. \nThe current water tariffs in Kazuo need to increase gradually to achieve full cost recovery, \ni.e., to cover O&M costs, debt service, and depreciation of proposed facilities. During the first year \nof operation, tariffs in Kazuo will cover 76% of cost; full cost recovery will be achieved after 3 years. \nThe Government has given assurance that tariffs will be increased in phases, taking into account \naffordability factors. \n \n63. \nThe  affordability  assessment  shows  that  in  Kazuo,  water  cost  as  a  percent  of  average \nhousehold income is 1.0%\u20131.2%. Response from the household survey indicates that these rates \nare affordable. The expenditure on utility costs as a percentage of income for the poor is relatively \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nhigher.  The  Kazuo  government  provides  a  subsidy  to  low-income  families  through  the  Minimum \nLiving Standard Scheme and has assured that subsidies to poor families will continue. \n \n64. \nFinancial  sustainability  of  the  non-revenue-generating  components  was  determined  by \nexamining  O&M  and  debt  service  costs  as  a  percentage  of  local  government  revenues. \nAffordability  was  assessed  by  comparing  identified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  funds \nrequired  for  the  counterpart  portion  of  capital  expenditures  during  project  implementation. \nForecasted  debt  service  and  O&M  costs  for  the  subproject  components  were  compared  as  a \npercentage  of  revenues  and  found  to  be  1%  or  less,  indicating  acceptable  fiscal  risk.  During  the \npeak project implementation period, counterpart funds for all three subprojects will not exceed 5% \nof  revenue.  Therefore,  the  non-revenue-generating  components  are  considered  both  financially \nsustainable and affordable. \n \nThe  results  of  the  financial  management  assessment  indicate  that  LPG  has  an  adequate \n65. \nfinancial  management  system  and  experience  in  managing  projects  funded  by  foreign  financial \ninstitutions.  The  three  implementing  agencies  of  the  core  subprojects  operate  as  bureaus  or \ndepartments of the project local governments. Accounting and financial management systems for \nfinancial reporting and accounting are developed and adequate for loan implementation, although \nimprovements  to  internal  control  might  be  required  to  ensure  that  separate  individuals  handle \nauthorization,  recording,  and  custody  of  assets  and/or  transactions.  Audit  arrangements  are \ngenerally  adequate  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  required  to  submit  independently \naudited  annual  financial  statements  and  project  accounts  to  ADB  as  a  loan  covenant.  The  water \nutility  in  Kazuo  will  be  assisted  to  establish  a  reliable  financial  management  system  at  the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation.  It  will  keep  accounts  in  accordance  with  commercial \naccounting principles and be subject to an independent external audit by a suitably qualified firm of \ncommercial  auditors.  Accounting  will  be  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC  standards.  A  capacity-\nbuilding component to strengthen financial management is included in the Project. Supplementary \nAppendix T provides details of the financial management assessment. \n \n66. \nEconomic  Aspects.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  is  based  on  analysis  of  the \nthree  core  subprojects,  taking  into  account  their  socioeconomic  indicators  and  preparedness  to \nundertake  investments  in  municipal  infrastructure.  It  covers  the  (i)  economic  rationale  for  public \nintervention, (ii) goals of the investment plans, and (iii) design of the plans. The economic rationale \nis sound as the Project will (i) support Liaoning to promote city and town development in a more \ncoordinated  and  cost-effective  manner,  and  (ii)  bring  about  more  sustainable  investments  in \ninfrastructure  that  aim  to  support  inclusive  economic  growth  and  improve  the  quality  of  life.  The \neconomic  analysis  also  evaluates  the  components  relative  to  least-cost  analysis  criteria  and \nstandard benefit\u2013cost analysis. The results of the economic analysis indicate that the components \nare  economically  viable  and  stand  up  to  sensitivity  analyses  where  costs  increase  and  benefits \ndecrease. The economic internal rate of return for the three core subprojects is 17.7%; and for the \nindividual subprojects: 18.0% for Donggang City, 16.7% for Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County, \nand  18.4%  for  Linghai  City.  A  summary  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14;  the  detailed \neconomic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix U. \n \n67. \nEnvironmental  Aspects.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.  Extensive \npublic  consultations  involving  surveys,  meetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus-group  discussions \nwere undertaken during project preparation. The EIA of the Project is based on the results of the \nEIAs prepared for the three core subprojects, which are representative of the types and nature of \nsubsequent  subprojects.  The  SEIA  was  circulated \nto  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  \n19  November  2008.  An  environmental  assessment  and  management  framework  was  developed \nfor subsequent subprojects. \n \nThe  Project  supports  climate  change  adaptation  including  (i)  incorporation  of  climate \n68. \nchange \nplans;  \n(ii)  comprehensive  water  management,  such  as  long-term  water  availability  forecasting  for  new \n\nefficient  measures, \n\nurban  master \n\nissues, \n\nenergy \n\nsuch \n\nas \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment  areas  and  adopting  comprehensive  water  balance  measures  during  project \nimplementation;  (iii)  sustainable  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  including  sludge \ndigestion  and  biogas  extraction;  (iv)  improved  urban  roads  management  and  reduced  pollution \nfrom  cars  through  improved  connectivity  and  better  travel  conditions;  and  (v)  promotion  of  clean \nenergy for more efficient central heating. \n \n69. \nThe  Project  aims  to  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization; \nnarrow  the  urban\u2013rural  gap;  and  improve  production,  employment,  and  living  conditions  in  small \ncities  and  towns  of  Liaoning  Province.  It  will  have  substantial  environmental,  health,  and \nsocioeconomic  benefits.  Roads  will  improve  the  transportation  network  and  connectivity,  thereby \nreducing  travel  time  and  vehicle  emissions  per  trip,  reducing  the  potential  for  increased \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  climate  change  impacts. Water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment \nwill improve public health and reduce pollutant discharge to rivers and groundwater sources. River \nimprovement,  and  embankment  and  landscaping  works  will  provide  flood  protection,  reducing \neconomic  loss  and  public  health  hazard  due  to  flooding,  as  well  as  enhancing  wetland  habitats. \nThe  Project  promotes  climate  change  awareness,  stimulates  internal  demand  for  climate  change \ninitiatives,  opens  discussion  for  climate  adaptation,  advances  climate  change  mitigation  efforts  in \nvarious sectors, and empowers practitioners with user-friendly tools. It provides an opportunity for \nLPG  to  put  in  place  sound  environmental  management  systems  in  small  cities  and  towns,  and \nestablish adequate institutional capacity in environmental management to ensure sustainability for \nfuture development. \n \nAdverse  impacts  on  the  physical  and  natural  environment  during  the  construction  and \n70. \noperation  phases  of  the  Project  will  be  insignificant  with  good  project  management  and \nimplementation of recommended mitigation measures identified in the environmental management \nplan.  The  plan  includes  institutional  strengthening  for  implementing  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements, and will be continuously developed as the Project progresses to provide \nmore details so that all mitigation requirements are met. \n \n71. \nThe  subsequent  subprojects  under  this  sector  loan  are  also  required  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  EIA \nrequirements.  An  environmental  assessment  and  management  framework,  in  Supplementary \nAppendix V, is prepared as an instruction manual to assist Liaoning PMO, the subproject PMOs, \nthe implementing agencies, and the local design institutes in preparing and reviewing EIA reports \nand \nthe \nenvironmental  criteria  in  subproject  selection  and  implementation,  key  environmental  issues, \nconduct of the EIA, preparation of the EIA reports, and review procedures. Training was provided \nto LPG on implementation of the environmental assessment and management framework. \n \nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures. The Project does not have any unusual technical \n72. \nrisks.

The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  long \n1. \npromoted  the  development  of  small  cities1 and  towns  as  a  way  to  achieve  a  more  balanced \nurban system. It has been wary that large-scale migration from the countryside would lower the \nproductivity  of  the  fledgling  urban  economy  and  undermine  industrial  growth,  and  so  curbed \nmigration for many years through the hukou (household registration) system and promoted the \ndevelopment of small cities and towns as alternative destinations for rural migrants. Waves of \nmigration  into  urban  areas  since  the  1980s have  contributed  to  a  steep  rise  of  urbanization  in \nthe country over the last 30 years. In 2006, about 44% of the national population lived in urban \nareas, up from 18% in 1978. The results of the development policy since the mid-1990s have \nbeen uneven. While almost all provincial governments have success stories, most of the growth \nof cities and towns has taken place in the eastern and southern regions of the country, where \nthe  rise  of  export-oriented  manufacturing  has  benefitted  settlements  of  all  sizes.  While \ngovernment  policies  have  been  instrumental  in  building the  linkages  between  town-based  and \ncity-based firms, national macroeconomic and trade policies have contributed as much to small \ncity  and  town  development  in  coastal  regions  as  urbanization  policy.  The  relative  lack  of \ndevelopment  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  western,  northern,  and  some  central  provinces \nprovides evidence of this. \n \n2. \nThe 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) 2006\u20132010 takes advantage of the potential of small \ncities and towns to increase national economic productivity, while narrowing the urban income \ngap, thereby contributing to social stability. It calls for strengthening the physical and economic \nlinkages  between  major  cities  in  metropolitan  areas  or  major  development  corridors,  and  the \nsmall cities and towns at their periphery. Continuity with previous policy is achieved through an \nexplicit priority on migration to small cities and towns rather than to the megacities. Consistent \nwith  the  PRC\u2019s  emphasis  on  \u201charmonious  development,\u201d  the  plan  also  calls  for  equitable \ndistribution of the benefits of urban development. \n \n3. \nLiaoning Province. Many small cities and towns in Liaoning recently have experienced \nrapid  development  but  now  face  challenges  similar  to  those  of  other  northern  Chinese \nprovinces.  Rapid  growth  has  resulted  in  environmental  pollution  and/or  worsening  of  living \nconditions; the inadequacy of infrastructure provisions has constrained growth. The provision of \nemployment for the current citizens and migrants from the rural and less-developed areas is a \ngreat  challenge,  and  necessitates  substantial  investment,  usually  overstretching  limited \nfinances. \n \n4. \nMost  of  the  small  cities  and  towns  in  the  province  have  a  relatively  low  population, \naveraging about 9,000, and cannot serve as effective linkage between large and medium-sized \ncities  and  the  rural  areas,  or  absorb  most  of  the  surplus  rural  workforce.  Regional  disparity  is \napparent  as  most  of  the  15  poor  counties  are  in  the  western  part.  To  provide  role  models  for \nsustainable  growth  of  small  cities  and  towns,  employment  generation,  and  improved  living \nstandards,  the  Liaoning  Small  City  and  Town  Framework  Plan  (2003\u20132020)  stresses  the \ndevelopment of cities and towns along major transport routes, especially near major cities that \nhave  the  ability  to  spur  the  development  of  surrounding  areas,  while  helping  less-developed \nareas.  The  Liaoning  11FYP  calls  for  strengthened  construction  of  small  cities  and  towns, \nplanned  expansion  of  the  built-up  area  of  county-level  cities,  and  focused  development  of \nindustrial  districts  in  counties  to  boost  urbanization.  The  Liaoning  Province  Committee  of  the \nChinese  Communist  Party  issued  Circular  Number  [2006]  9,  which  recommends  ways  to \nexpedite  county-level  economic  development,  such  as  developing  industries  producing  spare \n                                                 \n1   Small cities in the PRC are generally considered to have populations in the 100,000\u2013250,000 range. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nparts, promoting tertiary industries, expediting growth of county seats and key towns, and giving \nmore assistance to underdeveloped counties. \n \n5. \nBased  on  these,  all  the  three  core  subprojects  chosen  for  this  Project  are  along  major \ntransport corridors, have employment generation potential, and have attained a certain level of \ndevelopment.  The  loan  will  offer  Kazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County,  from  the  poorer  and \ndrier western part, the opportunity to develop environmentally sustainable infrastructure that will \nenable  investments  in  natural  resource  processing,  manufacturing,  and  services.  The  cities  of \nDonggang  located  on  the  eastern  coast  and  Linghai  on  the  central  coast  have  achieved  high \ngrowth  rates,  and  can  improve  living  conditions  and  the  environment  by  investing  in  urban \nenvironmental infrastructure financed by the loan. \n \n6. \nThe Project involves several levels of government intervention. The Liaoning provincial \ngovernment  is  promoting  development  in  multiple  cities  and  towns  across  the  province  in  a \nmore coordinated and cost-effective manner. It is uniquely positioned to achieve demonstration \neffects  of  the  subprojects  by  sharing  success  stories,  development  approaches,  and \nimplementation mechanisms with other small cities and towns across the province. The city and \ncounty  governments  are  implementing  their  master  plans  through  capital  investment  in  roads, \nwater  supply,  wastewater,  solid  waste  management,  and  district  heating  works;  and  will  own \nand manage most of the completed facilities. \n \nThe national and Liaoning provincial policies on small cities and towns, in line with the \n7. \nrecommendations  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank-funded  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy \nStudy  in  Liaoning  and  Shanxi  provinces,  form  the  basis  of  the  Project.2 Poor  small  cities  and \ntowns in Liaoning need to develop their infrastructure to attract investment in natural resource \nprocessing, manufacturing, and services. Others that have achieved high growth require better \ninfrastructure to improve living conditions and protect the environment. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  11FYP  calls  for  reduction  of  the  economic  distance  to  markets,  linkage  of  the \nwestern and eastern provinces, and integration of rural areas into national transport networks. \nGovernments  of  high-growth  small  cities  and  towns  are  challenged  to  provide  roads  and \nassociated  services  to  accommodate  the  need  for  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential \ndevelopment.  In  most  cases  they  must  build  the  roads  themselves  to  establish  the  physical \nframework  to  attract  investment  in  industry,  and  commerce  and  provide  decent  housing  to \ncurrent and future residents, essential for their future growth. \n \nDue  to  the  rapid  growth  of  Liaoning  and  resulting  increase  in  traffic  volume,  the \n9. \nComprehensive  Transport  Plan  of  Liaoning  Province,  put  forward  in  Liaoning  City  and  Town \nSystem Planning (2003\u20132020), was used as the basis for the road  sector  analysis.  The  traffic \nplan associated with the Liaoning 11FYP set high investment targets for land and sea transport \ninfrastructure,  and  related  technological  and  service  improvements.  Targets  include  that  by \n2010, every county will be connected to an expressway and every village connected to a paved \nroad and provided with public passenger transport. A network of ring and radial types of major \nexpressways  across  the  province  and  connected  to  major  ports  and  other  provinces  will  be \ncompleted.  Outdated  roads  in  county-level  cities  and  above  will  be  reconstructed.  The  road \n\nRoads and Associated Services \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy \nStudy.  Manila.  The  study  concludes  that  the  overarching  factor  should  not  be  growth  of  production,  but  rather \ngrowth  of employment that  will contribute more to the Government\u2019s goal of closing  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap. \nThe  study  recommended  growing  both  cities  and  towns  by  facilitating  the  development  of  larger  urban \nagglomerations made up of different types of urban settlements and proposed that key towns should be selected \nbased on their \u201cemployment rate of return,\u201d i.e., the number of jobs created per yuan invested by government. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\ncomponents  of  the  Donggang  and  Linghai  subprojects  will  improve  accessibility  of  individual \nareas  and  enable  extension  of  municipal  services  to  existing  and  proposed  premises,  thus \nenhancing  living  standards.  This  will  upgrade  inadequate  and  outdated  infrastructure  for \nresidents  and  the  markets;  and  serve  future  residential,  commercial,  and  office  uses.  This  will \nstrengthen  the  economy,  improve  the  physical  and  business  environment,  and  support  urban \narea trade with rural areas and other cities. \n \n10. \nDonggang City is a seaport in southeastern Liaoning, facing the Yellow Sea to the south. \nIt is the northern starting point of the PRC\u2019s coastline, with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea across Yalu River to the southeast. With an important harbor near the border, it is being \ndeveloped as a distribution center for many agricultural, aquatic, and industrial products outside \nthe province; the subproject road component will promote this development. A new trunk road \nwill  link  existing  roads  to  form  a  loop  around  the  city  center.  Upgrading  of  two  existing  trunk \nroads  and  a  secondary  road  with  associated  drainage  and  wastewater  pipes  and  lighting,  as \nwell as construction of a bridge, is included in the component. The bridge, located on the West \nRing  Road  across  the  Dadonggou,  the  main  river  crossing  the  city  and  draining  to  the  Yellow \nSea, will link major districts of the city. The upgraded roads will improve the traffic condition and \nfacilitate public transport. More products are expected to pass through the city upon subproject \ncompletion, generating employment and developing markets for agricultural products near and \nfar, which will particularly benefit those engaged in agricultural production. Capacity building in \nurban  planning  and  traffic  engineering  will  improve  the  authorities\u2019  traffic  management \ncapability. \n \n11. \nLinghai  City  is  a  coastal  city  on  Liaodong  Bay  in  Bohai.  It  has  four  markets:  one  for \nagricultural products, one for spare parts for cars, and the other two for daily necessities where \nwomen are major traders. Many roads in the built-up area have outdated services, lack proper \ndrainage  and  lighting,  and  are  not  served  by  public  transport.  The  subproject  component \nincludes  the  upgrading  of  two  trunk  roads,  eight  secondary  roads,  and  a  branch  road,  with \nassociated  water  supply  and  drainage  pipes  and  lighting.  This  will  improve  living  standards, \nfacilitate  traffic  flow,  promote  economic  growth,  and  improve  road  safety.  Public  transport \nservices will be introduced in the areas served. \n \nC. \n \nRapid  urbanization  in  the  PRC,  including  development  of  small  cities  and  towns,  has \n12. \nexacerbated  water  resource  depletion  and  deterioration  of  the  water  environment.  Water \nshortage due to pollution of water sources is a key reason for the inadequacy of potable water. \nThis  threatens  the  drinking  water  safety  of  urban  and  rural  residents.  In  view  of  this,  the \nGovernment  is  making  efforts  to  promote  centralized  water  supply  facilities  to  minimize  safety \nproblems  of  scattered  water  sources,  and  encourages  construction  of  centralized  municipal \nwastewater treatment plants. Nevertheless, municipal wastewater in most small cities and towns \nis not effectively collected due to inadequate municipal sewer networks. Construction of water \nsupply  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  requires  substantial  funding,  which  brings  financial \npressure to the small city and town governments. \n \n13. \nLiaoning Province\u2019s water resources are scarce: only 800 cubic meters per capita, 1/3 of \nthe national average. The potable water coverage is only 39%. Many water supply facilities are \nold,  network  coverage  is  low,  and  production  capability  of  the  water  sources  is  inadequate. \nMany drainage pipes and channels have been used for 40 years, some for 100 years; breakage \nand blockage are serious. In rural areas, some of the underground water sources contain high \nfluorine content, taste bitter, and are unhygienic. \n \n14. \nKazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County  is  poor  but  recently  has  expedited  growth  in  its \nGongyingzi  New  District  with  investment  from  a  number  of  industrial  enterprises  that  employ \n\nWater Supply, Drainage, and Wastewater \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRiver Improvement \n\nmany workers. However, water shortage constrains development: the capacity and coverage of \nthe  water  supply  system  is  too  low,  and  too  many  individual  wells  do  not  favor  the  unified \nmanagement and scheduling of water supply. An environmentally sustainable water source is a \nriver basin at Nanliangzi village, 18 kilometers from the new district. The proposed water supply \ncomponent  includes  water  intake  works  at  the  water  source,  water  transmission  pipes,  an \nintermediate  pumping  station,  a  water  treatment  plant,  and  water  distribution  pipes.  It  will \nimprove the infrastructure to previously unserved villages where the rate of poverty is high, and \nserve  as  a  growth  engine  creating  employment  opportunities  for  the  surplus  labor  and \nexpediting development in the new district. \n \n15. \nThe  present  water  supply  and  drainage  networks  of  Donggang  and  Linghai  cities  are \noutdated, density of the pipe network is low, and standards of design and construction are poor. \nTo  improve  living  standards  and  the  urban  environment,  storm-water  and  wastewater  pipes, \npumping stations, and a box culvert are included in the Donggang subproject; and water supply \npipes, a reservoir, a pumping station, storm-water pipes, and a box culvert are included in the \nLinghai subproject. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nRivers  in  the  PRC  are  seasonal\u2014about  70%  of  annual  rainfall  occurs  from  June  to \nSeptember in most areas\u2014and the channel beds are often littered with solid waste, filled with \nsediment, and polluted by untreated wastewater. River improvement projects aim to reshape the \nriver  channels;  install  embankments;  and  landscape  riverbanks  with  walkways,  trees,  shrubs, \nand vegetation, providing flood control as well as a scenic urban park. \n \nDadonggou  River  is  a  key  part  of  the  flood  prevention  and  tidal  protection  system  of \n17. \nDonggang  City,  and  an  important  passage  for  urban  drainage  and  fishing  and  freight  ships \ngoing out to the Yellow Sea. The local government has been endeavoring to improve the river \nand its banks for decades. From 1936 to 1998, 19 large-scale floods, 9 gales with a wind scale \nof  9  or  above,  astronomical  tides,  and  basinwide  rainstorms  threatened  life  and  property.  The \n2.4 kilometer (km) long embankment dikes included in the Donggang subproject are on the right \nbank of the Dadonggou, and will reinforce and connect to the existing embankment. The design \nstandard adopted for flood and tidal protection will be for a return period of 50 years, up from 5 \nyears  at  present.  In  addition,  1.1  square  kilometers  (km2)  along  the  riverbank  will  be \nlandscaped,  with  some  recreational  facilities  added  for  the  general  public.  The  river \nrehabilitation and dredging, riverside renewal, and area upgrading works will provide a cleaner \nenvironment for residents, alleviate flooding damage, help realize the comprehensive benefits of \nall  the  works  on  the  Dadonggou,  and  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  Donggang \nCity. \n \nE. \n \n18.  While the core subprojects do not include any solid waste management or environmental \nsanitation  components,  these  elements  are  included  in  some  of  the  subsequent  subprojects. \nNone of the small cities and towns in Liaoning have a sanitary landfill for domestic garbage, all \nof which is disposed in the open or buried in a simple manner, polluting water resources. Most \ngarbage  collection  vehicles  are  seriously  worn,  and  there  are  few  garbage  collection  stations. \nFor proper waste management and sanitation, waste collection and disposal facilities should be \nconstructed  and/or  procured,  including  sanitary  landfills,  public  toilets,  garbage  collection \nstations, dustbins, and garbage collection vehicles. \n \n\nWaste Management and Sanitation \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nPROCESS OF SUBPROJECT IDENTIFICATION, SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND \nAPPRAISAL \n\n \n1. \nUnder  the  sector  loan  approach,  the  Liaoning  provincial  government  (LPG),  the \nExecuting Agency, has established a three-stage approach for identifying, selecting, preparing, \nand  appraising  subprojects  for  inclusion  in  the  Project.  These  procedures  will  be  used  to \nappraise  subsequent  subprojects,  and  identify  and  select  additional  subprojects  needed  to \nensure  full  utilization  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan.  LPG  has  delegated  various \nactions and decisions to the Liaoning project management office (PMO). \n \nA. \n \n2. \nLPG  has  invited  county-level  city  and  county  governments  in  Liaoning  Province  to \nexpress  their  interest  in  participating  in  the  Project  to  be  partly  financed  by  the  ADB  loan.  In \nissuing this invitation, LPG refers to basic selection criteria: \n \n\nStage 1: Subproject Identification and Selection \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nThe  subproject  must  be  in  the  urban  development  sector,  i.e.,  related  to  the \nphysical  development  of  small  cities  and  towns,  with  particular  emphasis  on \ninfrastructure development. The eligible subsectors for subproject investment are \nroads and associated municipal services, water supply, wastewater management, \nriver  improvement,  area  upgrading,  solid  waste  management,  district  heating, \nand education. \nThe subproject must be a county-level city or county or a town. \nA master plan supports the subproject. \nThe  subproject  must  improve  environmental  quality  and/or  enable  employment \ngeneration, as follows: \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(4) \n\nthe  subproject  city  and \n\nthe  natural  environment;  and/or \n\nImprove  environmental  quality  by  accomplishing  one  of  the  following:  \n(1)  rehabilitate  polluted  areas \ntown;  \nin \n(2) lower the rate of (or slow the rate of) pollution of water, land, and/or \nair in urban areas; (3) treat solid waste or wastewater prior to discharge \ninto \nincrease  environmental \nsustainability of the subproject city and town development through more \necologically sensitive settlement patterns or infrastructure services. \nIncrease  employment  generation  by  accomplishing  one  of  the  following: \n(1) facilitate investment in labor-intensive economic sectors including the \nservice  sector;  (2)  remove  a  specific  infrastructure-related  barrier  to \ngrowth  of  an  economic  sector  in  the  subproject  city  and  town  (that  is, \nenable  economic  growth  through  provision  of  infrastructure  service);  \n(3) enable the development of residential areas for employees of new or \nexpanding  businesses  (i.e.,  providing  roads  and  associated  municipal \nservices  for  urban  expansion  areas);  (4)  strengthen  linkages  of  the \nsubproject  city  and  town  economy  with  the  metropolitan  or  subregional \neconomy  (including  growth  corridors  and  clusters);  and/or  (5)  increase \naccess of the urban poor to economic opportunities. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  local  government  must  confirm  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart financing. \nThe  local  government  must  confirm  its  willingness  for  the  subproject  to  comply \nwith ADB safeguard policies and other requirements. \nImplementation must be during 2009\u20132015. \n\n(vii) \n \nStage 2: Subproject Preparation \n\nB. \n \n3. \nPreparation  by  local  governments  involves  designating  an  implementing  agency  (or \ninitially  an  office  of  the  government)  to  prepare  project  design  documents  including  a  project \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nStage 3: Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n\nLocal  design  and  other  specialist  institutes  (locally  appointed)  will  support  local \n\nproposal  and  feasibility  study  report  under  the  guidance  of  the  Liaoning  Development  and \nReform  Commission  (LDRC);  with  the  help  of  the  Liaoning  PMO,  an  environmental  impact \nassessment, and (if required) a resettlement plan to standards necessary to meet both domestic \nand  ADB  requirements.  Governments  must  also  determine  suitable  institutional  arrangements \nfor project implementation and prepare a detailed financing plan. \n \n4. \ngovernments in their work and compliance with ADB requirements. \n \nTo  facilitate  an  orderly  and  consistent  appraisal  of  the  subprojects,  the  Liaoning  PMO \n5. \nrequires a subproject appraisal report in a common format to be prepared (to ADB standards) \nfor  each  proposed  subproject,  including  technical,  social,  resettlement,  financial,  economic, \ninstitutional, and environmental analysis. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  ADB  project  team  has  developed  a  detailed  set  of  evaluation  criteria,  which  was \ndiscussed  and  agreed  with  LPG.  This  is  to  ensure  that  individual  subproject  appraisal  is \nconducted in accordance with ADB standards. The appraisal of the three core subprojects will \nalso serve as guidance for the appraisal of subsequent subprojects. \n \nEach subsequent subproject PMO will prepare a subproject appraisal report, which will \n7. \nfollow  the  template  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  (which  also  shows  the  summary \nappraisal  criteria),  and  submit  it  to  the  municipal  finance  bureau  for  review  and  then  to  the \nLiaoning  PMO  for  review.  The  Liaoning  PMO  will  submit  the  appraisal  report  to  the  Liaoning \nFinance Bureau and LDRC for endorsement. \n \n8. \nRejected  subprojects  are  to  be  referred  to  the  relevant  local  governments  with \nindications of where the preparations and proposals are deficient, and for additional preparation \nwork  (assuming  the  subprojects  have  a  realistic  chance  of  meeting  the  agreed  evaluation \ncriteria). \n \n9. \n \n10. \n \n\nSubprojects approved by LDRC will be forwarded to ADB for approval. \n\nAll subproject approvals by ADB or LPG will only be made if \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  subproject  includes  an  environmental  impact  assessment  which  has  been \nendorsed  by  the  Liaoning  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and  ADB,  and  has \nbeen subject to relevant public consultation and disclosure; and \na  resettlement  plan,  meeting  ADB  requirements,  has  been  prepared  and \napproved by the relevant local government, and endorsed as satisfactory by ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A4.1: Asian Development Bank Assistance for Infrastructure and Environmental \nImprovement in the

WASTEWATER UTILITIES \n\nObjectives \n\nA. \n \nTo  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  water \n1. \nsupply and wastewater infrastructure, ADB will provide a grant to strengthen the institutional and \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  entities  involved  in  planning,  financing,  implementing, \noperating,  and  maintaining  water  and  wastewater  systems  in  the  subproject  small  cities  and \ntowns.  This  includes  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  providers  participating  in  both  core \nand  subsequent  subprojects.  The  assistance,  to  be  administered  by  the  Liaoning  provincial \ngovernment,  will  also  focus  on  improving  the  provincial  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for \nthese providers and, where appropriate, the national policy and regulatory framework. \n \n2. \nThe capacity-building assistance will improve the ability of water and wastewater service \nproviders  to  respond  to  ongoing  urbanization  challenges  by  enhancing  their  ability  to  deliver \nsustainable services. Specifically it will \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nhelp  the  participating  entities  develop  a  comprehensive  corporate  strategy  to \nwater  and  wastewater  service  provision  in  which  organization  structures, \npersonnel,  and  systems  and  procedures  are  aligned  with  corporate  goals  and \nobjectives; \nadopt a demand-driven approach for service delivery, in which service levels and \ncoverage  for  water  and  wastewater  are  set,  and  interventions  designed  in \nresponse to the expressed priorities and preferences of end users; and \nstrengthen financial management and cost recovery so that revenues cover costs \nto  the  extent  possible  and  the  service  provider  is  able  to  meet  its  substantial \nfinancial obligations in an environment of rapidly expanding service provision. \n\nScope of Work \n\n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe team implementing the capacity-building assistance will assess the institutional and \nfinancial  capacity  of  the  designated  service  providers,  formulate  a  program  to  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  (including  training,  assistance  with  corporate  reform,  improvement  of \nadministrative  systems  and  procedures,  and  design  of  pilot  interventions),  and  assist  with \nimplementing  the  program.  The  team  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  work  closely  with  the  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  responsible  for  administration  of  the  grant  and \nrecruitment of consultants. \n \nC. \n \n4. \n \nD. \n \nInternational consultants will comprise an operations and institutional specialist, and a financial \nmanagement specialist. National consultants will  comprise a financial specialist, an operations \nand institutional specialist, a water and wastewater pricing specialist, a training specialist, and a \ncustomer outreach specialist. \n \n \n\nThe work will be carried out over 12 months commencing in early 2010. \n\nPeriod of Performance \n\nStaffing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n263.8 \n39.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.6 \n305.0 \n \n9.3 \n2.0 \n11.3 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n316.3 \n \n26.9 \n25.3 \n52.2 \n \n77.6 \n77.6 \n446.0 \n\nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A6.1: Summary Cost Estimates \n\nCNY Million \n\nForeign \nExchange \nCosts \n\nLocal \nCurrency \nCosts \n\nTotal \nCosts \n\nForeign \nExchange \nCosts \n\n$ Million \nLocal \nCurrency \nCosts \n\nTotal \nCosts \n\nPercentage \nof Total \nCosts \n\nItem \n\nA.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization;  narrow  the  urban\u2013\nrural gap; and improve production, employment, and living conditions in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. \nAlthough  the  Project  will  not  reduce  poverty  directly,  it  will  contribute  to  achieving  short-  and  long-term  poverty \nreduction  impacts.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  PRC\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  development  of  the \nnortheastern  region,  which  aims  to  decrease  the  income  gap  between  urban  and  rural  residents,  and  supports \nLiaoning\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) 2006\u20132010 to promote sustainable economic development, particularly in small \ncities and towns, via improvements to environmental and transport infrastructure. All project components are integral \ncomponents of the 11FYP. The Project is consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy to increase access \nto safe and reliable water supplies, and will help the PRC achieve the Millennium Development Goal 7 (environmental \nsustainability) and target 10 (to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nbasic sanitation by 2015). The Project adheres to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy in the PRCa to make markets \nwork more efficiently through (i) urban infrastructure development, (ii) promotion of environmental sustainability, and \n(iii) pro-poor equitable and inclusive growth. \n \nSmall  cities  and  towns  in  Liaoning  have  made  substantial  progress  in  recent  years  in  facilitating  economic  growth. \nHowever, the government-wide priority on gross domestic product growth has supported industrial development more \nthan  service  sector  growth.  This  has  limited  the  impact  of  investments  on  job  creation  and  ultimately  poverty \nreduction.  The  Project  aims  to  help  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization,  narrow  the \nurban\u2013rural gap, improve production, generate employment, and improve living conditions. The Project will contribute \nto achieving short- and long-term impacts by removing infrastructure constraints, improving access to and quality of \npotable water, reducing health risks from waterborne diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and promoting \nsustainable economic growth in seven small cities and towns of Liaoning Province. The Project will benefit 260,000 \nresidents in the three core subproject cities and towns of Donggang, Kazuo, and Linghai; and 660,000 residents in \napproximately four subsequent subproject cities and towns. \n \nWith  the  infrastructure  improvements,  Kazuo  will  be  able  to  attract  more  industrial  investors  and  promote  local \nemployment opportunities. In Linghai, the mobility of people and products will be enhanced through better and safer \ntransportation  networks.  Donggang\u2019s  position  as  an  importer\u2013exporter  will  be  strengthened  by  improved  roads  and \nother  improvements.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne \ndiseases  and  flood  risk  in  small  cities  and  towns,  providing  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and \noperation  of  project  facilities,  with  anticipated  flow-on  effects  on  social  and  economic  development.  Specific \nanticipated benefits include the following: \n \n\n(i)  Job creation. Construction of works under the three core subprojects will directly generate 580,000 work-\ndays  of  new  employment  and  indirectly  generate  an  additional  930,000  work-days  through  a  multiplier \neffect. Seventy percent of construction jobs will be unskilled. Operation of the  works created by the three \ncore  subprojects  is  expected  to  generate  about  2,800  full-time  jobs  directly  and  4,520  full-time  through \nmultiplier effects each year. The loan assurances specifically address employment of the poor, women, and \nethnic minorities, which will contribute to narrowing the income gap and reducing poverty. \nImproved  public  health.  The  three  core  subprojects  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases \narising from contamination  of water, associated increases in medical expenses (estimated to be CNY287 \nper  capita  annually),  and  time  lost  from  work  leading  to  a  loss  of  income  (estimated  to  be  CNY220  per \ncapita annually). For the detailed health impact analysis, see Supplementary Appendix N. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  Environmental  protection.  Improvement  of  sewerage  systems  and  flood  control  will  protect  the  local \nenvironment and promote sustainable growth. Introduction of the public education and awareness program \n(PEAP)  will  help  ensure  the  success  and  sustainability  of  project  improvements  and  their  impact  on \npeople\u2019s lives. \n\n(iv)  Improved  quality  of  life.  Road  construction  will  facilitate  mobility,  access,  and  affordability  of  key  basic \nservices.  Water  and  sanitation  improvements  will  improve  health  and  significantly  reduce  time  burdens, \nparticularly for women. The PEAP and community monitoring teams will enhance awareness and promote \naccountability of local basic services. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(v)  Skills  training.  The  subprojects  will  include  skills  training  in  collaboration  with  other  stakeholders,  and \n\nthrough the resettlement plans. Vulnerable groups are prioritized for skills training in the loan assurances. \n\n \nEnvironmental and socioeconomic benefits will accrue to the local populations; benefits will be felt especially by the \npoor  who  are  most  vulnerable  to  environment-related  diseases  and  poor  urban  environments.  For  subsequent \nsubprojects,  a  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  will  be  prepared  as  part  of  the  subproject  appraisal  report \n(Supplementary Appendix B). \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \n\n(Nonincome Millennium Development \nGoal) \n\n1. Key Issues \nLiaoning  Province  is  located  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  PRC.  In  2007,  5.6%  of  the  total  urban  population  was \nliving  below  the  official  poverty  line,  compared  with  3.8%  nationally.  Five  of  27  cities  and  counties  in  Liaoning  are \nclassified  as  poor.  The  province  is  identified  in  the  PRC  national  development  strategies  as  geographically \ndisadvantaged with higher urban poverty than other regions, requiring special efforts through prioritized allocation of \nresources. \n \nWithin Liaoning Province, poverty rates vary among the subproject cities and towns. Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous \nCounty, one of the provincial key poverty reduction counties, has a high incidence of poverty, with 16.5% of the urban \npopulation  and  10.4%  of  the  rural  poor  population  living  under  minimum  guaranteed  living.  In  Donggang  City  the \nurban  poverty  rate  is  2.6%  and  the  rural  rate  is  4.1%;  in  Linghai  City  the  urban  poverty  rate  is  4%,  and  rural  rate \n7.3%. The unemployment rate in Kazuo is 33%, in Donggang 4.3%, and in Linghai 4.4%; these are all higher than the \nnational target of \u201cunder 4%\u201d called for in the 11FYP. \n \nUnemployment,  limited  income  sources,  and  subsequently  poverty  are  major  issues  in  all  of  the  subproject  areas. \nThe  focus  group  discussions  and  stakeholder  analyses  reveal  that  the  major  causes  of  poverty  in  the  subproject \nareas are lack of employment opportunities, limited skills to create income, inadequate alternative income generation \nsources,  poor  infrastructure,  and  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases.  Details  are  available  in  Supplementary \nAppendix P, the poverty and social assessment and social action plan. \n \n2. Design Features \nThe project design attempts to address social and poverty dimensions of the subprojects by (i) reducing impacts on \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (ii)  encouraging  employment  of  local  labor,  especially  the  poor  and  women;  and \n(iii)  employing  participation  strategies  such  as  a  community-based  PEAP,  community  monitoring  teams  during \nimplementation,  and  community  management  committees  during  operation  of  the  new  infrastructure.  The  social \naction  plan  outlines  strategies  for  mitigating  adverse  impacts  and  promoting  positive  benefits  such  as  employment, \nskills training, and awareness-raising. \nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis \nA  socioeconomic  survey  was  undertaken  with  a  sample  of  518  randomly  selected  households  and  interviews  with \n1,689 people. In addition, 17 focus group discussions involving 131 people were conducted. The poverty and social \nanalysis  identifies  vulnerable  groups  and  opportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions,  and  recommends  social  action \nmeasures,  participation,  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  positive  social  benefits.  The  analysis  indicates  that  with \nrapid  urbanization,  development  challenges  for  the  province  include  inadequate  public  services,  groundwater \npollution,  and  insufficient  urban  transport  networks.  The  Project  aims  to  address  these  issues  and  meet  the \ndemands of residents by improving water supply, river management, and roads and associated municipal services. \nThe main findings of the social analysis for three core subprojects are as follows. \n \nThe project components meet the beneficiaries\u2019 urgent needs. Currently the coverage rate of piped  water supply in \nthe Kazuo subproject area is 32% and in Linghai 50%; unconnected households generally use well water. Water from \nsome  wells  in  Kazuo  contains  bacteria  and  a  high  content  of  fluorine,  leading  to  dental  fluorosis,  especially  among \nchildren,  and  high  rates  of  diarrhea.  Water  service  quality  in  Linghai  is  limited  by  extensive  leakage  from  the \ndistribution  network  and  inadequate  pressure  to  serve  multistory  apartment  buildings.  Despite  living  in  apartments, \nresidents spend a lot of time collecting water. Many residents in the Donggang and Linghai subproject areas, lacking \naccess  to  sewerage  or  drainage  systems,  dispose  of  untreated  wastewater  directly  into  their  yards  or  the  street, \nthereby  polluting  the  local  living  environment  and  groundwater  supplies.  Floods  occasionally  occur  in  Donggang, \ncausing  flood  damage  to  property  and  undermining  local  environmental  quality.  The  transport  network  in  Linghai  is \ncharacterized by insufficient traffic management facilities and measures for pedestrians and nonmotorized transport \nusers. \n \nThe  components  included  in  each  subproject  were  identified  through  the  household  survey  and  focus  group \ndiscussions  as  the  top  priorities  of  local  residents  and  stakeholders.  The  Project  will  provide  tap  water  for  89,000 \npeople and wastewater collection for 84,000, and improve transport conditions and flood control for 84,000 residents \nin the core subproject areas. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n47 \n\nEthnic  Minorities. A small percentage of ethnic minorities (3%) live scattered throughout the core subproject cities \nand  towns.  The  social  analysis  determines  that  they  are  socially  and  economically  integrated  with  the  majority \npopulation and will not be subject to any adverse impacts as a result of the Project. Land acquisition and resettlement \nof  the  core  subprojects  will  affect  less  than  20  ethnic  minority  people  and  specific  ethnic  minority  development \nmeasures are included in the resettlement plans. Along with the poor, vulnerable, and women, the minority population \nwill be given prioritized access to jobs created under Project. \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1.  The  major  stakeholders  included  were  (i)  groups  directly  affected  by  the  Project  in  a  positive  or  negative  way, \nincluding men, women, elderly, poor, minorities, schools, businesses, and related organizations; and (ii) government \norganizations such as the Executing Agency, implementing agencies, Development and Reform Commission, Civil \nAffairs  Bureau,  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  Women\u2019s  Federation,  Minority  Affairs  Office,  Finance  Bureau,  Health \nBureau, Labor and Social Security Bureau, and Environmental Protection Bureau. Several meetings were held with \nstakeholders, including vulnerable groups such as women, the poor, and ethnic minorities. In addition, a number of \nkey  informant  interviews  were  conducted  with  various  bureaus,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  Women\u2019s \nFederation; and past and ongoing projects in complementary areas to inform the project design. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n Information sharing \n\n Consultation \n\n Collaborative decision making \n\n Empowerment \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \nPublic disclosure of all subproject documents will be made at the project management office and on the ADB website, \nincluding  the  project  information  document,  design  and  monitoring  framework,  resettlement  plans,  summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  and  environmental  management  plan,  and  social  and  environmental  monitoring \nreports. A project information document was prepared for the Project. Booklets outlining the resettlement plans were \ndistributed to affected households and disclosure meetings held. Copies of the booklet are available at the respective \nproject management office, and each affected village office. \n \nPEAP and a training program will be conducted to promote hygiene education and traffic safety education, recycling \nprogram,  and  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.  The  following  results  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through  the \nPEAP:  (i)  increased  participation  and  consultation  of  local  population  in  project  implementation  and  monitoring, \n(ii)  increased  awareness  of  project  benefits  and  acceptance  of  the  Project,  (iii)  increased  hygiene  knowledge  and \nreduced incidence of water- and vector-borne diseases, (iv) increased traffic safety knowledge and lower incidence of \ntraffic  accidents,  (v)  increased  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  garbage  recycling  as  part  of  the  solid  waste \nmanagement  program,  and  (vi)  increased  environmental  awareness  on  the  part  of  businesses  and  enterprises. \nCommunity  and village project management and monitoring groups  will  be established to help  with the selection of \nlabor for construction, environmental protection and road safety awareness, community grievances, and monitoring of \nimplementation of the social action plan. \nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. In addition to the economic and employment benefits that will accrue to all beneficiaries, some social \nimpacts of the  Project are clearly  gender related. Improved drinking  water systems,  wastewater collection systems, \nand traffic improvement next to the markets will benefit and reduce time burdens for women in particular. The focus \ngroup discussions (FGDs) indicate that women strongly support the Project and anticipate benefits of improved living \nenvironment, new employment opportunities, reduced time burdens, and lower incidence of preventable illness. \n \n2. Actions. Project assurances prioritize women for employment and skills training. Targets have been set for project \nemployment opportunities for women and the poor during construction and for related training. Women will be actively \nengaged  in  the  community  and  village  project  management  groups  and  the  PEAP  promoting  hygiene  education, \ngarbage  recycling  program,  and  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.  The  PEAP  will  work  with  the  All  Chinese  Women \nAssociation  and  women\u2019s  street  committees.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system,  resettlement  plans,  and \nenvironmental management plan will include gender disaggregated data, where relevant. \nSocial Safeguard Issues and Other Social Risks \n\nIII. \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nThree resettlement plans (a full \nresettlement plan for Donggang, a short \nresettlement plan for Kazuo, and a due \ndiligence report for Linghai subproject) \nwere prepared and endorsed by local \ngovernments, and will be approved by ADB \nprior to loan appraisal.

Based on \nthe  nature  of  the  subprojects,  some  will  need  full  resettlement  plans,  some  will  need  short \nresettlement  plans,  and  others  will  require  due  diligence  reports  for  cases  where  the  land \nneeded  for  subproject  construction  has  already  been  requisitioned.  The  resettlement  planning \nand  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  those  affected  will  be  better-off  or  at  least  not \nworse-off as a result of the Project. In general, the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of \nthe Project vary from subproject to subproject. For the three core subprojects, a full resettlement \nplan  was  prepared  for  the  Donggang  subproject,  a  short  resettlement  plan  for  the  Kazuo \nsubproject, and a due diligence report for the Linghai subproject. Similar subprojects can follow \nany of the three resettlement documents, as relevant. \n \n2. \nThe impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A12. In total, the Project will acquire \nabout  27.15  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  a  little  more  than  16  ha  is  classified  as  cultivated \nland. The Project will also require the temporary acquisition of 7.6 ha of land, of which 1.8 ha is \nfarmland.  A  total  of  11,174  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  houses  has  been  or  will  be \ndemolished.  The  total  number  of  affected  persons  is  1,103.  The  budget  of  the  Donggang  and \nKazuo core subprojects is estimated at $8.7 million. \n \n\nTable A12: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \nResettlement \nPlan \nDocument \n\nPermanent \nLand \nAcquisition \n(ha) \n\n \n\nOf which \nCultivated \n(ha) \n\nTemporary \nLand \nOccupation \n(ha) \n\n \n\nHouse \nRelocation \n(m2) \n\n \n \n\nNumber of \nAffected People\n\n25.69 \n\n16.31 \n\n0.0 \n\n11,174.00a \n\n1,051 \n\n1.46 \n\n1.46 \n\n7.6 \n\n0.00 \n\n52 (permanent\nland loss) \n\n \n\nProject \nComponents \n(subprojects) \nDonggang \nUrban \nInfrastructure \nConstruction \n\nKazuo Water \nSupply \n\nLinghai Urban \nRoad \nConstructionb \n\nTotalc \n\nFull \nresettlement \nplan \n\nShort \nresettlement \nplan \n\n0.0 \n\n7.6 \n\nDue diligence \n\n50.73 \n\n37.67 \n\n1,607.18 \n\n943 \n\n \n\n27.15 \n\n17.77 \n\n11,174.00 \n\n1,103 \n\nha = hectare, m2 = square meter. \na  For Donggang, of the 11,174 m2 to be demolished, 7,645 m2 are residential structures affecting 91 households and \n\n336 people; and 3,529 m2 are nonresidential structures, affecting eight enterprises and 61 shops. \n\nTo  avoid  or  minimize \n\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement, \n\nb   For Linghai, the required land was acquired in 2007 and the affected amount is not included in the total impacts. \nc   The total does not include the due diligence information for Linghai. \n \n3. \ncommittees, and street committees were closely consulted during the feasibility study stage. \n \n4. \nCompensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPRC  (2004)  and  the  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land \nAdministration  (Document  28,  November  2004).  House  demolition  is  based  on  the  Provincial \nand  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment  Administration  Regulations.  The  prepared \nresettlement  plans  comply  with  the  PRC  laws  and  regulation  of  resettlement  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Based  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and \nthose affected, and general practice in the subproject cities and county, the respective city and \ncounty  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing  agencies  adopted  a  set  of \ncompensation  standards.  The  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land \n\nlocal  officials,  village \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nin \n\ninto \n\nintegrated \n\ninterviews, \n\nthe  planning;  concerns  were \n\nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by \ndeveloping  and  comparing  a  series  of  design  alternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements \nprovided  are  based  on  market  or  replacement  value,  and  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those \naffected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of \nimprovement; (iii) the land temporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be kept to a \nminimum;  (iv)  all  affected  people,  legal  and  illegal,  are  to  be  taken  into  consideration  and \naccounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain \nthe  previous  livelihood  standards;  (vi)  where  land  allocation  per  capita  is  not  sufficient  to \nmaintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-generating activities will be provided; \n(vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups in such things as compensation, \npayment of special fund, minimum living guarantee, and employment; (viii) all those affected will \nbe  adequately  informed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and \nincome restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be \ncarried out to identify and resolve any problems. \n \nThose affected will be notified about the key elements of the resettlement plans prior to \n5. \nADB \nfocus  group \nloan  appraisal.  On  various  occasions  during  meetings, \ndiscussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local \nrepresentatives  have  participated \nthe \nresettlement plans. The resettlement information booklet of each subproject will be distributed to \naffected villages and households. The resettlement plans will be provided to village offices and \nresident committees, and posted on the ADB website. The respective subproject implementing \nagencies  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervision  of  implementation,  continued \npublic consultation, monitoring of progress, and response to grievances. Procedures to address \ngrievances  will  be  established  and  explanations  included  in  the  resettlement  information \nbooklets. \n \n6. \nFor land acquisition, at least 80% of land compensation, and 100% of the resettlement \nsubsidy  for  standing  crops  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  people.  For  residential  houses  and \nnonresidential structures (enterprises and shops) to be demolished, compensation will be paid \nto  owners,  including  those  without  house  certificates.  The  payment  will  be  made  in  cash \naccording to the appraised value of the property. Households that have to relocate will receive a \nrelocation  allowance  (CNY16.9  million  or  $2.5  million  equivalent).  Compensation  for  standing \ncrops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  be  paid  directly  to  those  affected.  Income  losses \nresulting  from  reduced  production  and  sales  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project  will  be \ncompensated in cash. \n \n7. \nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i)  replacement  of  housing,  and  (ii)  restoration \nof livelihoods and income. For people losing housing in rural areas, two resettlement options are \navailable:  receive  cash  compensation  or  cash  compensation  plus  provision  of  house  plots  for \nhouse construction by affected people themselves. Assistance will be provided to construct new \nhouses  or  find  available  housing  close  to  the  original  home,  if  that  is  their  preference.  The \nrespective  city  and  county  PMOs,  implementing  agencies,  and  local  town  and  street-level \ngovernments  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  house  construction  and  relocation  during \nresettlement implementation. \n \nMeasures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include  (i)  provision  of  employment  opportunities \n8. \nduring  project  construction  and  operation,  (ii)  provision  of  basic  social  insurance  to  those \naffected  whose  land  is  newly  acquired,  (iii)  deposit  of  land  compensation  and  resettlement \nsubsidy  in  banks  for  income  earnings  from  interest,  (iv)  development  of  economic  crops  with \nhigher  economic  value,  (v)  promotion  and  development  of  new  enterprises  and  self-employed \nsecondary  and  tertiary  businesses,  and  (vi)  provision  of  technical  training  to  those  affected  to \nincrease their skills. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nEach  PMO  and  implementing  agency  will  have  at  least  one  full-time  staff  member \n9. \nresponsible  for  land  acquisition  and  another  for  resettlement.  The  staff  from  each  subproject \nresettlement unit will take the lead responsibility for coordinating the planning, implementation, \nfinancing,  and  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with \nrelevant  village  officials,  land  administration  bureaus,  and  house  demolition  offices;  and  be \nresponsible for supervising and monitoring resettlement (e.g., delivery of entitlements, selection \nof new housing sites, restoration of incomes, provision of replacement land, and other economic \nmeasures). A training program will be organized for the resettlement officers. \n \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  Donggang  and  Kazuo \n10. \nsubprojects  is  equivalent  to  CNY59.2  million  or  $8.7  million  in  2008  prices,  including \ncontingencies.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to  precede  the  subproject \nconstruction  schedules,  and  be  completed  prior \nto  subproject  construction.  Detailed \nmeasurement  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  each  village,  neighborhood,  and  enterprise  and \nshop;  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with  village  committees, \nhouseholds,  and  enterprises.  Based  on  these  surveys,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated \nand submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n \n11. \nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. \nMonitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  plans.  Each  implementing  agency  will  carry  out \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement \nplan. The PMO and implementing agencies have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with \nADB,  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  resettlement  activities.  An  independent \nagency under contract to the PMO or implementing agencies will carry out external monitoring \nand evaluation. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \n12. \nTo  assess  resettlement  aspects  of  subsequent  subprojects,  a  resettlement  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix R) was prepared. Each subproject that involves land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  will  have  to  comply  with  the  principles  of  the  resettlement  framework \nand  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Once  specific  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts are confirmed, a short or full resettlement plan must be developed based \non the policies and procedures set forth in the resettlement framework, and in line with the PRC \nlaws  and  regulations  on  resettlement  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  have  also \nbeen  adopted.  The  objective  of  the  resettlement  framework  is  to  ensure  that  all  the  affected \npersons  (permanent  and  temporary)  whose  business  or  employment  places  or  farmland  are \nacquired;  or  whose  houses  are  demolished;  or  whose  production  operations  are  affected;  or \nwhose crops, trees, and property are affected, whether in part or in full, will be compensated for \ntheir losses at replacement costs and/or all necessary assistance so that they may improve or at \nleast keep or reattain their original production facilities or capacity and their living standards. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nRevenue-Generating Component: Kazuo Water Supply \n\n \n1. \nThe financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). 1  An  assessment  of  financial \nperformance  was  completed  for  Donggang  city  government  (DCG),  Kazuo  Mongolian \nAutonomous  county  government  (KMACG),  and  Linghai  city  government  (LCG).  The  financial \nanalysis was undertaken for the revenue-generating component, i.e., the water supply scheme \nin  Gongyingzi  Town  within  KMACG.  A  financial  sustainability  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the \nnon-revenue-generating  components:  roads  and  river  upgrading  in  Donggang  and  road \ndevelopment in Linghai. \n \nA. \n \nMethodology.  The  financial  analysis  measured  the  ability  of  the  Kazuo  subproject  to \n2. \ngenerate  sufficient  revenues  from  operations  to  meet  all  costs,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M),  debt  servicing,  depreciation,  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on \ninvestment. The analysis incorporates the required tariff increases into the financial model and \ncompares  these  with  the  affordability  of  households.  The  base  case  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR)  is  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  Sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted to assess the impact of changes in costs and revenues. \n \nFinancial  projections  (balance  sheet,  and  income  and  cash  flow  statements)  were \n3. \ndeveloped  for  the  water  supply  company,  Gongyingzi  District  Potable  Water  Company,  based \non  the  projected  operating  performance  of  the  Project.  The  financial  analysis  is  based  on \nincremental cash flow effects from the Project. \n \n4. \nAssumptions.  All analysis was conducted in constant July 2008 prices. The FIRR was \ncalculated  using  incremental  annual  cash  flows  over  25  years  with  no  residual  value.  Project \ncapital expenditures are estimated based on the proposed implementation schedule and include \nphysical  contingencies.  O&M  costs  include  only  incremental  costs  incurred  under  the  Project. \nRevenues are calculated based on generated volume, tariff rate, and tariff collection efficiency. \n \n5. \nWeighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital.  The  WACC  is  calculated  in  real  terms.  Funding \nsources are the ADB loan, contributing 42%, and counterpart funds from KMACG, contributing \n58%.  Assumed  nominal  costs  of  funds  are  4.5%  for  the  ADB  loan  and  0.8%  for  government \nfunds.  Long-term  inflation  is  estimated  at  1.7%  for  foreign  costs  and  5.1%  for  local  costs. \nAllowing for taxes at 25.0% on both loan and equity, the WACC is estimated at 1.2%. \n \nTariffs  and  Affordability.

The  Government  agrees  with  the  gradual  tariff  increase.  During \nproject implementation, water tariffs will cover all O&M where the weighted average water tariff \nis about CNY2.47/m3 and cost recovery2 is 69%. In 2016, after 3 years of operations, full cost \nrecovery will be achieved. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

The  city  and  county  governments \nreceive  income  from  taxation,  nontax  income,  shared  revenues  with  the  central  Government, \nand  transfers  and  subsidies  from  the  central  Government.  Although  income  from  taxation \nincreased  during  2003\u20132007  in  all  governments,  its  share  of  total  revenue  s  decreased,  while \nthe share of financial transfers noticeably increased.

Some training in ADB financial management and reporting \nprocedures will, however, be required. \n \n20. \nAll implementing agencies have prescribed financial procedures that define duties of key \nfinance staff and procedures for record keeping and cash management. These procedures are \ngenerally  followed,  and  internal  controls  such  as  proper  authorization  of  transactions,  payroll \ncontrols, and regular bank reconciliations, are generally adhered to. Since this is the first ADB \nproject that the implementing agencies are undertaking, training in ADB financial management \nand reporting procedures will be required. \n \n21. \nAccounting  and  financial  management  systems  for  financial  reporting  and  accounting \nare developed and adequate for the purpose of loan implementation, although improvements to \ninternal control might be required in the area of segregation of duties. To address this, additional \nstaff  should  be  recruited  during  project  implementation.  Audit  arrangements  are  generally \nadequate  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  required  to  submit  independently  audited \nannual  financial  statements  and  project  accounts  to  ADB  as  a  loan  covenant.  Each \nimplementing agency will be helped to establish a reliable financial management system at the \nbeginning of project implementation. The Kazuo water utility will keep accounts in accordance \nwith  commercial  accounting  principles  and  be  subject  to  an  independent  external  audit  by  a \nsuitably  qualified  firm  of  commercial  auditors.

For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the economic rationale \nfor  public  intervention,  goals  of  the  investment  plan,  and  general  design  of  the  plan  including \nselection  criteria  for  subprojects.  The  economic  analysis  also  evaluates  the  individual  core \nsubproject  components  for  least-cost  and  benefit\u2013cost  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was \nconducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects1 (1997) and \nEconomic  Analysis  Retrospective  2005:  Strengthening  Quality\u2013at  Entry  of  ADB\u2019s  Operations2 \n(2006)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  detailed  economic  analysis  and  least-cost \nanalysis are in Supplementary Appendix U. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nRationale  for  Public  Intervention.  The primary motivation for the Project results from \nincreasing concern over the inability of infrastructure provision to keep pace with population and \neconomic growth in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. Due to continuing urbanization \nand strong growth of the industrial and commercial sectors across the province, many cities and \ntowns are experiencing high economic growth rates, rising household incomes, increased use of \nprivate cars, changes in living style that create a more diversified range of travel demands, and \nchanges in urban land use patterns that are increasingly dependent on motorized transport. At \nthe same time, local governments have not been able to provide the basic urban infrastructure \nneeded \nimpacts  of \nindustrialization and urbanization. Furthermore, these small cities and towns face environmental \nthreats from pollution of surface and subsurface waters from untreated garbage, water pollution \nin  rivers  and  streams,  poor  drainage  and  flooding,  and  poor  sewerage.  Local  residents, \nincluding the poor and other vulnerable groups, are bearing the cost of these deteriorating urban \nenvironments. \n \nThe  Project  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The  Liaoning \n3. \nprovincial  government  is  promoting  development  of  small  cities  and  towns  in  a  more \ncoordinated  and  cost-effective  manner  by  bringing  about  more  sustainable  investments  in \nphysical  and  environmental  protection  infrastructure  that  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  life. \nInvolvement  of  the  Liaoning  provincial  government  is  justified  since  the  development  program \nspans  several  small  cities,  counties,  and  towns.  The  city,  county,  and  town  governments  are \ncoordinating  and  implementing  the  elements  of  the  urban  transport  master  plans  and  making \nindividual  investments  in  roads;  water  supply;  heating;  and  environmental  improvement \nincluding  garbage  and  solid  waste,  proper  drainage,  and  connection  of  households  to  the \nwastewater network. They will be involved in owning and managing the completed facilities. \n \n4. \nGoals of the Investment Plan. The Project is a direct response to Liaoning\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan (11FYP) to promote sustainable economic development, particularly in its small cities \nand  towns,  via  construction  and  upgrading  of  road  infrastructure,  water  supply,  and \nenvironmental improvement. The 11FYP recognizes that achievement of these goals will require \nimprovement  of  basic  municipal  services  and  environment  quality  in  these  areas.  All  project \ncomponents are integral components of the 11FYP. City and county governments are required \nto  make  investments  in  roads,  water  supply,  heating,  and  environmental  improvement.  The \nsmall city and town government master plans are reasonably sound, and are integrated with the \noverall planning process. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997.

The  selection  of  the  three  core \n5. \nsubprojects  was  based  on  socioeconomic \nto  undertake \ninvestments  in  municipal  infrastructure.  The  core  subprojects  are  Donggang  City,  Kazuo \nMongolian Autonomous County, and Linghai City. The availability of viable investment projects \ndirectly  supporting  approved  development  master  plans  and  programs,  and  the  potential  to \nserve  as  models \nloan \nimplementation are some of the considerations in selecting subprojects. Targeting and selection \nof subsequent subproject cities and towns will be based, among other factors, on their potential \nto  grow  economically  and  provide  jobs  to  in-migrants  from  rural  areas.  Employment  growth  is \ndeemed  to  contribute  more  to  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  closing  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap \nthan the growth of production. The core subprojects focus on development of citywide primary \nand secondary infrastructure, with emphasis on environmental infrastructure. \n \nKey  urbanization  issues  are  (i)  inadequate  availability  of  infrastructure  such  as  water \n6. \nsupply,  heat  supply,  and  wastewater  and  solid  waste  treatment;  (ii)  severe  air,  river,  and \ngroundwater pollution; (iii) significant share of the urban population living below the poverty line; \nand (iv) lack of holistic and integrated management of urban development. The Project aims to \naddress  these  issues  in  the  participating  cities  and  towns  to  help  promote  balanced  and \nenvironmentally sustainable urbanization; narrow the rural\u2013urban gap; and improve production, \nemployment, and living conditions. \n \nThe criteria for identifying and selecting subprojects and components are (i) confirmation \n7. \nby  the  participating  local  government  of  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange  for  counterpart \nfunding, (ii) confirmation by the participating local government of its willingness to comply with \nADB  safeguard  policies  and  other  requirements,  (iii)  implementation  of  the  component  from \n2009 to 2015, (iv) eligibility of the components (the sectors must be included in the list of eligible \ninfrastructure and municipal services, (v) anticipated positive impact on the urban environment, \n(vi)  anticipated  positive  impact  on  employment  generation  and/or  economic  growth,  and  (vii) \nanticipated  positive  impact  on  the  coverage  or  service  level  of  infrastructure  and  municipal \nservices. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nDonggang City Roads and Associated Municipal Services and Bridge, and Linghai \nCity  Roads  and  Associated  Municipal  Services.  The  demand  analysis  was  performed  in \nterms of (i) selection and definition of the representative vehicle types; (ii) assessment of annual \naverage  daily  traffic  (AADT);  and  (iii)  forecast  of  demand.  A  vehicle  fleet  consists  of  a  mix  of \nseveral  vehicle  types  that  use  a  road  network  (cars,  trucks,  buses,  motorcycles,  and \nnonmotorized  transport).  Traffic  counts  were  conducted  on  each  of  the  proposed  road \ncomponents. The traffic survey implemented in April 2008 serves as the basis for determining \nAADT. To establish the AADT from the average daily traffic, seasonal variations are assessed \ntaking  into  account  the  main  factors  driving  changes  in  traffic  patterns,  such  as  the  weather \n(rainy  season,  winter,  etc.),  agricultural  cycles,  holiday  periods,  and  tourist  season.  The  traffic \nforecast comprises growth of (i) normal traffic, which corresponds to the growth that would occur \neven without improving the road network; and (ii) generated traffic, which occurs only if the road \nnetwork is improved significantly and/or new roads are constructed. Forecasts for normal traffic \ngrowth is based mainly on official gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates. Traffic forecast \nflows  are  subsequently  based  on  an  assumed  income  elasticity  of  demand  relative  to  GDP \ngrowth.3 The  forecast  GDP  growth  rates  were  applied  to  the  calibrated  base  year  matrices  to \nproduce passenger and freight vehicle flows. \n \n                                                 \n3   Elasticity  coefficients  are  based  on  the  previous  studies  and  are  assumed  to  be  1.4  for  passengers  and  1.1  for \n\nDemand Analysis \n\nfreight. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nKazuo  (Gongyingzi)  Water  Supply.  The  Project  will  mainly  address  the  water  supply \n9. \nshortage  in  the  new  district,  but  it  will  also  improve  water  quality  and  provide  safe  water  for \ndomestic use in the urban area of the town. Water demand is estimated to reach 32,670 cubic \nmeters (m3)/day by 2020. Of this amount, the demand for recycled water (for urban landscaping, \nstreet  cleaning,  and  partially  for  industrial  purposes)  is  5,640  m3/day;  the  existing  capacity  is \n4,000  m3/day.  The  net  water  requirement  is  therefore  about  23,000  m3  per  day,  which  is  the \ncapacity that will be provided by the Project. This will benefit close to 260,000 people or 80,000 \nhouseholds. The Project will supply drinking water according to national standards 24 hours a \nday at 120 liters per capita per day. Water pressure will reach at least the 6th floor of apartment \nbuildings; special measures will be taken for high-rise buildings. \n \n10. \nEvaluation of Individual Components. The methods of economic analysis adopted are \nbenefit\u2013cost  analysis  and  least-cost  analysis.  Benefit\u2013cost  analysis  is  mainly  applied  to  the \nwater  supply  and  roads  components,  while  least-cost  analysis  is  applied  to  the  river \nimprovement,  area  upgrading,  and  drainage  and  wastewater  network  components.  For  the \nwater  supply  component,  the  estimates  of  economic  benefits  are  based  on  the  results  of  the \ncontingent  valuation  survey  conducted  for  the  Kazuo  water  supply.  The  survey  aims  to  elicit \nbeneficiary  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  services  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  survey  is \nconducted at the household level and has three parts: (i) a discussion of the existing situation in \nterms of service levels as well as direct and indirect impacts on the well-being of the residents \nand the community; (ii) a discussion on the expected improvements in service, living conditions, \nand  the  impact  on  employment  as  a  result  of  expected  increases in  investments  in  industries, \nincluding the consequence on increasing incomes for the households and the city, county, and \ntown; and (iii) eliciting willingness to pay for the expected improvements and benefits from the \nProject.  Least-cost  analysis  will  involve  cost-effectiveness  analysis  of  the  least-cost  option \nrecommended for the component. \n \n11. \nIn addition to being part of the 11FYP, each component is economically justified on its \nown. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were estimated for each road component. The \nEIRRs  are  compared  with  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  which  is  assumed  to  be \n12%.  Major  benefits  quantified  for  the  roads  include  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs \nresulting from reduced travel distance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings resulting from \nfewer accidents, (iii) reduced maintenance costs, (iv) savings in the value of passengers\u2019 time \nand of freight tied up in transit, (v) generated traffic resulting from reduced transportation costs, \nand (vi) road safety benefits. \n \n12. \nAn economic analysis of the project component was conducted over 25 years, inclusive \nof project construction. Economic benefits and costs are denominated in terms of the domestic \nprice numeraire and expressed in constant mid-2008 prices. International costs were converted \nto local currency costs using an exchange rate of CNY6.8 per $1. Tradable components were \nadjusted  to  economic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.08  for  the  effects  of \nforeign  exchange,  and  nontraded  components  valued  at  domestic  market  prices.  A  shadow \nprice  is  used  to  put  an  economic  value  on  the  wages  paid  to  unskilled  labor  but  not  on  the \nwages paid to skilled labor, because there is no surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate \nfactor  of  0.50  was  used  to  convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of \nlabor. \n \n13. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  core  components  include  (i)  capital  costs  including  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  and  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  costs;  and  \n(ii)  costs  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  including  cost  of  replacement  of  depreciated \nequipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  are  estimated  based  on  their \nopportunity  costs,  that  is,  the  agricultural  output  foregone  and  the  re-siting  of  displaced \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nactivities.4 Transfer  payments,  including  taxes  and  interests,  are  excluded  from  the  economic \ncosts, while physical contingencies are included. \n \n14. \nFor  the  overall  economic  analysis,  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  utilizing  economic \ncosts is utilized with the feasibility indicators expressed in the following measures of viability: net \npresent  value  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  economic  viability  of  each \ncomponent  was  determined  using  the  EIRR  as  the  principal  quantitative  measuring  tool.  The \nEIRR is estimated by comparing the with-component and without-component scenarios. A core \nsubproject  component  is  considered  economically  viable  if  the  calculated  EIRR  is  higher  than \n12%, the social discount rate prescribed by ADB. The project component\u2019s financial cash flows \nare tested for responsiveness to changes in the values of key project variables with the use of \nsensitivity analysis. The following variables are evaluated for their impact on the Project: (i) 10% \nincrease in construction cost, (ii) 20% increase in O&M cost, (iii) 20% decrease in benefits, and \n(iv) combination of (i) and (iii); and (v) delay of benefits by 1 year. \n \nC. \n \nThe economic analysis indicates that the three components are economically viable and \n15. \nthat they stand up to sensitivity tests where costs increase and benefits decrease. The cost of \ninstitutional development was incorporated into each component road\u2019s economic analysis. The \nEIRRs  of  the  individual  components  are  shown  in  Table  A14.  The  economic  analysis \ndemonstrates  the  economic  viability  of  the  three  components.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity \nanalysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  components\u2019  economic  viability:  changes  in  key \nvariables,  20%  increase  in  construction  costs  and  O&M  costs,  delay  of  benefits  by  1  year, \ndecrease in benefits and simultaneous increase in costs and decrease in benefits. \n \n\nResults of Economic Analysis of Individual Components \n\nTable A14: Summary of Results for All Components \n\nComponent \n\nDonggang Roads and Associated Municipal Services and Bridge \nKazuo (Gongyingzi) Water Supply \nLinghai City Roads and Associated Municipal Services \nOverall Project \n\nMethod of \nEconomic \nAnalysis \nBCA \nCV, BCA \nBCA \n \n\nResults of Analysis \nEIRR  \n(%) \n18.0 \n16.7 \n18.4 \n17.7 \n\nNPV  \n(CNY million)\n25.5 \n36.6 \n40.5 \n102.6 \n\nBCA  =  benefit-cost  analysis,  CV  =  contingent  valuation,  EIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  NPV  =  net  present \nvalue. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   The economic opportunity cost of land will be assumed to be equal to the replacement value of farmland calculated \n\nfor land compensation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 August 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "yuan (CNY) \n", "CNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.1463  \n", "= \n=  CNY6.8313 \n", " \nFor the purpose of calculations in this report, an exchange rate of $1.00 = CNY6.83 has been \nused. \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nDCG \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nFYP \nGDP \nKMACG \nLCG \nLDRC \nLIBOR \nLPG \nO&M \nPEAP \nPMO \nPRC \nPPMS \nSEIA \nTA \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nDonggang city government \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental monitoring plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfive-year plan \ngross domestic product \nKazuo Mongolian Autonomous county government \nLinghai city government \nLiaoning Development and Reform Commission \nLondon interbank offered rate \nLiaoning provincial government \noperation and maintenance \npublic education and awareness program \nproject management office \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nproject performance management system \nsummary environmental impact assessment \ntechnical assistance \nweighted average cost of capital \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km2 \nm2 \nm3/day \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "square kilometer \nsquare meter \ncubic meter per day \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China ends \non 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
