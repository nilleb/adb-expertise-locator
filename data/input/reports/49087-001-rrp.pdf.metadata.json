Generation  depends  heavily  on  conventional  fuels,  with  65%  produced  by  natural  gas \nand  18%  produced  by  coal  and  lignite,  with  only  6%  produced  by  renewable  energy  sources \n(excluding  large  hydroelectric  power  plants).  Natural  gas  has  traditionally  been  Thailand\u2019s \nreliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling reserves in the Gulf \nof Thailand mean the country must transition toward securing alternative sources. As part of its \nstrategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, the Government of Thailand \nprepared the Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u20132036,2 which (i) notes the significant \npotential  of  solar  power  in  Thailand,  and  (ii)  indicates  that  energy  imports  can  be  avoided \nthrough developing domestic solar projects with private investment. The plan aims to increase \nthe  share  of  renewable  energy  used  for  power  generation  to  30%,  including  the  installation  of \n19,684 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW coming from solar power. \n \n3. \nTo  implement  Strategy  2020  and  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for \nThailand  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  emphasize  support  for  clean  energy, \nADB  identified  the  opportunity  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  the  project  through  close \ncooperation and strong relationships with various sponsors and financial institutions in Thailand \nbuilt over the last 5 years. Since its early engagement in the project, ADB has played a key role \nin devising the financing structure of \u2018single loan, multiple projects\u2019, which significantly reduces \ntransaction  costs,  improves  project  viability,  and  enhances  scalability  of  the  business  model, \nand played a catalytic role of mobilizing investment from local commercial banks.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe project involves the rollout and operation of multiple solar photovoltaic installations, \n4. \neach with a capacity ranging from 400 kilowatts-peak to 10 megawatts-peak (MWp), on rooftops \nor elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings owned or leased by host \ncompanies  in Thailand  up  to  an  aggregate  capacity  of 100  MW and  will  be  installed  at  no  up-\nfront cost to the host companies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe  project  has  strong  potential  to  be  scaled  up,  particularly  in  Thailand\u2019s  growing \n5. \nmanufacturing sector. Host companies will maintain connections to the national grid to augment \ntheir  power  supply,  and  they  will  benefit  from  the  project  in  the  following  ways:  (i)  discounted \nelectricity prices, (ii) more reliable electricity supply, (iii) avoidance of having to pay the up-front \n\n                                                              \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2015.

Bangkok. \n\n\f 2\n\ncosts  associated  with  developing  their  own  solar  power  facilities,  (iv)  reduced  emissions,  and \n(v) an  improved  corporate  image.  The  project  offers  attractive  benefits  for  Thailand,  including \n(i) helping  it  reach  its  renewable  energy  target  by  scaling  up  grid-parity  solar  power;  and \n(ii) increasing  its  use  of  distributed  generation  (i.e.,  power  that  is  generated  where  it  is \nconsumed), thereby reducing the need to upgrade and maintain grid infrastructure. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nSince  its  early  engagement  in  the  project,  ADB  has  played  a  key  role  in  devising  the \n6. \nfinancing  structure  of  \u2018single  loan,  multiple  projects\u2019,  where  the  financing  contemplated  will  be \nused to support multiple solar projects on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial \nand/or industrial buildings that have been traditionally difficult to finance individually due to their \nsmaller size. This structure significantly reduces the transaction costs borne by each subproject, \nthereby  increasing  their  stand-alone  viability  and  enhancing  the  scalability  of  the  business \nmodel of grid-parity solar projects that do not require FIT subsidies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n  \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\nThe borrower of the project is Thai-Sunseap Asset Company Limited, a special purpose \n7. \nproject company 55% owned by Weng Holding, Sombath Phanichewa and his immediate family \nmembers,  and  45%  by  Sunseap  Group.  Thai-Sunseap  Asset  Company  Limited  will  own  and \noperate 100% of the subprojects up to an aggregate capacity of 100 MW. \n \n8. \nWeng Holding is a privately held company that is part of an industrial conglomerate (the \nWeng Group)  led  by  a  prominent Thai  businessman,  Sombath  Phanichewa.  S.  Phanichewa  is \nthe  chairman  of  the  board  of  Don  Muang  Tollway,  which  operates  the  elevated  toll  road  from \nBangkok  metropolitan  and  the  northern  vicinities  as  the  main  and  direct  route  to  the  center, \nnorthern, and northeastern parts of Thailand under a concession granted by the Department of \nHighways.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n9. \nSunseap Group is a leading developer and the largest owner of solar rooftop systems in \nSingapore,  with  more  than  163  MWp  of  contracted  capacity.  It  has  won  five  out  of  six  solar \ntenders  called  by  the  Government  of  Singapore  to  date  to  install  photovoltaic  panels  on  the \nrooftops of a number of public housing and other government properties.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n10. \nImpacts.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  the  business  model  of  grid-parity \nrooftop solar projects on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial \nbuildings  that  do  not  require  FIT  subsidies  in  Thailand.  The  project  will  also  contribute  to  the \ndiversification  of  Thailand\u2019s  energy  mix  by  adding  alternative  energy  capacity  and  more \nelectricity  consumption  from  renewable  sources,  thus  helping  the  country  progress  toward  its \nrenewable energy target.  \n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nOutcome. The outcome will be the sustained operation of the private sector grid-parity \n\n11. \nrooftop solar business model in Thailand. \n \n12. \nOutput.  The  output  will  be  the  rollout  and  operation  of  multiple  solar  photovoltaic \ninstallations on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings, \nwith a total capacity of up to 100 MW. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nConsistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \n13. \nof  Strategy  2020. 3  The  review  reaffirmed  ADB\u2019s  support  under  Strategy  2020 \nfor \n(i) environmentally sustainable development; (ii) the role of the private sector in meeting growing \nenergy demand in the region; and (iii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure \ndevelopment,  finance,  and  other  areas.4 The  midterm  review  also  supported  the  expansion  of \nenvironment-friendly technologies for clean and efficient energy-generation and use, as well as \na larger role for private sector financing of infrastructure. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for  Thailand,  which  supports  three  core  strategic  pillars: \n(i) knowledge and innovation, (ii) private sector development, and (iii) regional cooperation and \nintegration. These  strategic  pillars  are  operationalized  in  four  program  areas: (i)  infrastructure; \n(ii) finance  sector  development;  (iii)  environment,  including  climate  change;  and  (iv)  regional \ncooperation  and  integration.5 The  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2015\u2013\n2036 sets a target of increasing the share of renewable energy and alternative energy used for \npower generation to 30% by 2036, including the installation of 19,684 MW of renewable energy \ncapacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW coming from solar power. \n \n15. \nConsistency with sector strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, \nwhich  emphasizes  investments  in  renewable  energy  and  wider  access  to  energy.6 The  project \nwill contribute to ADB\u2019s target of doubling annual climate financing to $6 billion by 2020. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 6 summarizes the implementation arrangements.7 \n\nTable 6: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nThe  project  involves  developing  multiple  solar  photovoltaic  installations  on  rooftops  or \nelsewhere  on  the  premises  of  commercial  and/or  industrial  buildings  owned  or  leased \nby host companies up to an aggregate capacity of 100 MW.

ADB\u2019s active participation enhances \nlocal commercial banks\u2019 confidence to co-invest because ADB is seen as playing an important \nrole  in  the  early  stage  of  development  of  the  grid-parity  rooftop  solar  business  model  by \ncatalyzing  investment  and  setting  high  standards  for  subsequent  scale-up  in  Thailand.  ADB\u2019s \ninnovative  financing  structure  of  \u2018single  loan,  multiple  projects\u2019  will  significantly  reduce \ntransaction costs, increase project viability, and enhance the scalability of the business model.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n18. \nAlthough  Thailand  has  a  relatively  strong  banking  sector,  local  commercial  banks  are \nunable to provide the long tenors necessary for the innovative grid-parity solar business model. \nShorter  tenors  reduce  feasibility  and  increase  the  operational  leverage  of  projects,  which  may \nlead to undue financial distress. With high up-front capital costs and long-term revenue streams, \nrenewable energy projects require lower amortization profiles to enhance their financial viability. \nADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  fills  a  funding  gap  in  long-term  finance  that  will  ensure  that \ncommercial rooftop solar projects are financed in a sound and sustainable manner. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n19. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project have been identified to be minimal; and effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential adverse impacts will be incorporated in the \nenvironment, health, and safety (EHS) plan of the borrower.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n20. \nThe  borrower  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection strategy, will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.8 The  borrower  will  report  regularly  to ADB  on  (i)  its  and  its  contractors\u2019  compliance \nwith such laws, and (ii) the measures taken to achieve compliance. Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n21. \nThe  sponsors  and  the  borrower  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),9 \n22. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \n\n                                                              \n8  ADB. 2003.
