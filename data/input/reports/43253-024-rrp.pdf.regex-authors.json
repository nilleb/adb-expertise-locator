I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Karnataka  Integrated  Urban  Water \nManagement Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  Karnataka is one of India\u2019s most water-stressed states. With approximately 39% of the \nstate\u2019s population living in urban areas (against 31% for the country), Karnataka is the fifth most \nurbanized  state  in  India,  and  this  percentage  is  expected  to  increase  to  50%  by  2030. \nKarnataka\u2019s Vision 2020 anticipates increasing urbanization and industrialization, but without \neffective management of available water resources, water will constrain economic development. \nThe investment program aims to improve water resource management in urban areas in a \nholistic and sustainable manner consistent with the principles of integrated water resources \nmanagement (IWRM).2 The investment program will (i) provide investment support to modernize \nand expand urban water supply and sanitation (UWSS); (ii) strengthen institutions to improve \nwater use efficiency, productivity, and sustainability; and (iii) pursue innovative technologies and \ninstruments,  such  as  public\u2013private  partnerships  or  reform-oriented  incentive  funds.  The \ninvestment  program  will  support  the  greening  and  inclusiveness  agendas  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) as it targets assistance to fragile water-scarce environments, often \nlocated in Karnataka\u2019s economically lagging regions. The investment program will also support \nADB\u2019s  climate  change  strategic  priorities  by  promoting  climate-resilient  development  and \ncapacity development for adaptation. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Water scarcity. Karnataka, India\u2019s eighth largest state, accounts for about 5.1% of the \ncountry\u2019s  population,  5.8%  of  its  surface  area,  and  6%  of  its  surface  water  resources.3 \nKarnataka\u2019s seven major river basins suffer from water over-abstraction and deteriorating river \nwater  quality.  Major  sources  of  pollution  include  untreated  sewage,  industrial  discharges, \npesticide  runoff,  mining,  and  degrading  watershed  soils.  Water  resources  are  distributed \nunevenly in both time and space, and there are multiple competing users. The impact of climate \nchange, anticipated to exacerbate droughts and floods, may further reduce water availability. \nHowever,  Karnataka\u2019s  annual  water  demand  is  forecast  to  rise  by  up  to  40%  by  2025, \nthreatening sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. IWRM is therefore urgently \nneeded.  While  there  are  constraints  to  IWRM  (such  as  fragmentation  of  water  resources \nmanagement responsibilities among agencies and resistance to change), there are promising \nenabling  factors  (such  as  recognition  of  the  scarcity  and  threats  to  the  water  resource, \nprogressive policy statements, and a willingness to invest in and reform institutions).  \n \n4.  Urbanization and water. Karnataka is one of India\u2019s most economically progressive \nstates. As a result, the state economy is growing fast, with the annual gross state domestic \nproduct  growth  averaging  7.2%  in  FY2009\u2212FY2012. Water  is  central  to  the  state\u2019s  future \ndevelopment. While in 2013 85% of the state\u2019s available water was allocated to irrigation, 2025 \nprojections suggest a decline in the proportion used for agriculture to 73% and an increase in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  IWRM is a concept and process that promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land, and \nrelated resources to maximize economic and social welfare equitably and without compromising the sustainability \nof vital ecosystems and the environment. \n3  Karnataka has a population of 61 million, covers an area of 191,791 square kilometers, and has an inflow of \n1,869,000 million cubic meters of surface water. \n ", "2 \nhousehold drinking (from 4.4% in 2000 to 5.0% in 2025) and industrial water allocation (from \n3.6% in 2000 to 6.8% in 2025). This is consistent with Karnataka\u2019s economic development \nagenda for 2020, which prioritizes the sustainability of the state\u2019s environment and natural \nresources and anticipates increasing urbanization and industrialization. Greater water share for \nurban use also calls for more responsible stewardship of scarce resources.  \n \n5.  Sector  performance.  Urban  water  supply  and  sewerage  service  levels  vary \nsubstantially across Karnataka. Although 92% of the state\u2019s urban households report access to \ndrinking water, (i) six districts out of 30 suffer from acute shortages; (ii) household connections \nrepresent only a mere fraction of this value, as a large proportion of the population still relies on \nstandposts  for  their  daily  supply;  and  (iii)  rapid  urbanization  and  densification  beyond  the \nadministrative city boundaries do not always translate into service provision coverage to new \nareas.  In  addition  to  insufficient  coverage,  there  are  unmet  demands:  despite  constant \nimprovements,  water  supply  services  are  generally  intermittent,  with  inadequate  service \nstandards (pressure and quality) and insufficient metering. Available data for 213 urban local \nbodies (ULBs) in Karnataka suggests that only 38% of these provide water at normative levels \n(70\u2013135 liters per capita per day, depending on population size).4 While a few ULBs provide \nquasi-continuous water supply, average water supply services in most towns is 2\u20133 hours per \nday, requiring (mostly women) to fetch water from community taps. Causes for deficiency \ninclude  inadequate  water  source  availability,  financing,  or  population  increase,  and  also \nwastage and substantial system inefficiencies. While water meters are being introduced, water \naudits are uncommon. Nonrevenue water (NRW) estimates range from 30% to 50% across \nurban schemes in Karnataka, against the national service level benchmark of 15%. Water \nquality reports are seldom disclosed, and testing at the point of use is not frequently done. \n \n6.  Despite increasing attention by state authorities, sanitation still lags behind water supply \nthroughout  Karnataka.  Overall,  42%  of  the  urban  population  reports  access  to  sewerage \nnetworks, but only 15% is attached to treatment systems and households have often not yet \nconnected where sewers have been laid. Where sewerage networks are not available, black \nwater  and  gray  water  is  discharged  into  drains,  much  of  which  contributes  to  polluting \nKarnataka\u2019s water bodies. Meeting the steep demand for urban and industrial water, protecting \nwater bodies, and effectively treating and discharging and/or reusing effluent remain critical \nchallenges. In addition, 19% of the population is not covered by any sort of sanitation scheme. \nThe lack of sanitation facilities forces people to resort to open defecation, exposing them \n(especially women and girls) to health and safety risks. \n \n7.  Challenges and opportunities. Gaps and opportunities are as follows:\n \n(i)  City and regional water planning. Many ULBs in Karnataka have prepared city \ndevelopment plans capturing current and future needs for water-related services. \nThese are, however, neither updated nor linked to financing plans. Moreover, the \ndevelopment of water sources is generally on a scheme-by-scheme basis and \nseldom considers regional impacts and/or gains. \n(ii)  Water use and performance monitoring. In 2011, the state government issued \nan order making water metering compulsory. Most water schemes are in the \n                                                \n4  Data suggests that in South Karnataka (106 ULBs), 44% of the ULBs supply water that matches or exceeds the \nnorms.  In  North  Karnataka  (107  ULBs),  this  value  is  only  33%  (ADB.  2011.  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement and Sustainable Services Delivery in Karnataka\u2014Component 3. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila [TA \n7418-IND]). A separate study suggests that (i) 47% of Karnataka\u2019s ULBs provide more than 70 liters per capita per \nday, 42% provide 40\u201370 liters per capita per day, and 11% less than 40 liters per capita per day; and (ii)  53% of all \nULBs provide daily water supply, 28% on alternate days, and 19% every 3 or more days. The problem is \nparticularly acute during the dry season (ADB. 2012. Karnataka Integrated and Sustainable Water Resource \nInvestment Program\u2014Volume 1. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila [TA 7954-IND]).  \n ", "3 \nprocess of introducing bulk and household meters. However, most monitoring \ndata concerning water abstraction and/or losses in the network is still inaccurate. \nWater quality testing and effluent discharge records are often incomplete.  \n(iii)  Insufficient interagency coordination. Responsibilities for water issues have \nbeen traditionally fragmented and divided among departments, without a formal \nmechanism  for  coordination.  Fragmentation  in  decision  making  results  in \nsuboptimal  management  of  Karnataka\u2019s  limited  surface  and  groundwater \nresources. In 2010, the state government created an IWRM steering committee, \nand in 2011 it established the Advanced Centre for IWRM to provide advice and \nconduct research. \n \n8.  Service delivery challenges impacting water resource management in Karnataka are: \n(i)  Inadequate  asset  planning  and  management. In most ULBs, water-related \ninfrastructure is neither integrated nor adequately phased. Some elements are \noverdesigned (e.g., intakes and treatment units) and run at suboptimal conditions, \nwhile  others  are  not  given  sufficient  attention  (e.g.,  distribution  networks), \ncompromising technical and financial sustainability. ULBs often lack adequate \ntechnical staff to (a) operate and maintain, and (b) manage and plan water \nassets. Cognizant of the need to efficiently run and professionally manage water \nsystems, Karnataka has partnered with the private sector in service delivery.   \n(ii)  Demand management and investment financing. In 1996, Karnataka directed \nULBs  to  adopt  volumetric  tariffs.  Despite  improvements,  urban  infrastructure \nfunding and asset sustainability continue to be challenged by poor cost recovery \nmechanisms. In addition, unmetered supplies and public standposts have led to \nsignificant wastage. In response, in July 2011, Karnataka issued a government \norder  making  the  introduction  of  sewerage  tariffs  compulsory  and  raising \nminimum tariff levels. Karnataka has also led a number of urban finance reforms, \nincluding accounting and property tax reforms. \n \n9.  Road map and lending modality. Karnataka\u2019s integrated urban water management \nroad  map  will  assist  in  establishing  a  process  of  coordinated  planning,  development,  and \nmanagement of urban water resources in a way that maximizes economic and social welfare \nwithout  compromising  environmental  sustainability.5 The  physical  component  of  the  state\u2019s \ninvestment program is estimated at about $1.9 billion while the nonphysical component (reforms, \nmanagement improvements, and capacity development) is estimated at $110 million. The policy \nand institutional framework will provide the enabling environment necessary to improve urban \nwater  management,  enhance  technical  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  promote \ninstitutional  and  financial  sustainability.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  a \nfraction of the state\u2019s investment program through an MFF. The MFF is the modality of choice \nfor this investment program as it is the most effective modality to (i) maximize and measure \nproject  results  in  localized  geographical  areas;  (ii)  provide  efficiencies  associated  with \neconomies  of  scale  as  additional  municipalities  join  regional  utilities;  (iii)  blend  capacity \ndevelopment assistance with policy implementation and infrastructure provision, and phase it to \nmaximize ULB commitment; and (iv) carry out the application of a long-term road map, which \nprovides a structured framework to assist forecasting needs throughout the design process. The \nmodality  is  appropriate  given  (i)  the  state\u2019s  sound  record  in  the  sector,  experience  and \nwillingness  to  undertake  reforms;  and  (ii)  the  proven  capacity  of  the  Karnataka  Urban \nInfrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC). \n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n10.  Strategic context. The investment program is in line with (i) priorities outlined in India\u2019s \n12th Five Year Plan,6 (ii) policy directions outlined by the Ministry of Water Resources in the \nNational Water Policy (2013), and (iii) service delivery reforms promoted by the Ministry of \nUrban Development (including service level benchmarks and the National Urban Sanitation \nPolicy, 2008). The investment program has been designed in support of Karnataka\u2019s Vision \n2020 (which envisages eliminating poverty in all areas and the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015), the State\u2019s Water Policy (2002), and Karnataka\u2019s Urban Drinking \nWater and Sanitation Policy (2002). The investment program complements the activities under \nthe proposed Karnataka Integrated and Sustainable Water Resources Management Investment \nProgram for irrigation modernization, IWRM, and river basin management.7  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  and  lessons  learned. The road map\u2019s objectives are fully \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, which proposes to (i) pilot \nnew approaches for sustainable urban development in small and mid-sized cities with high \npotential for growth, (ii) encourage technical advancement, (iii) strengthen governance and reforms \nfor  service  delivery,  and  (iv)  develop  institutional  capacity.8 The  road  map  and  MFF  design \nincorporate lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in India, especially in Karnataka, including the need \nto (i) incorporate low-cost sanitation facilities for poor households, (ii) provide house service \nconnections for urban water and sewerage as part of the project scope, (iii) include targeted \nawareness  campaigns  for  changing  the  behavior  of  urban  residents,  and  (iv)  implement \ninstitutional reforms through standardized systems and processes at the state level.9 \n    \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  improved  sustainable  water  security  in  selected  river  basins  in \nKarnataka.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  water  resource  management  in  urban  areas  in \nselected river basins in Karnataka. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The investment program has three outputs, which are consistent with ADB\u2019s Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020:10  \n(i)  Output  1:  Expanded  and  upgraded  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure.  The  investment  program  will  finance  physical  investments \nassociated with (a) the rehabilitation and upgrading of inefficient water supply \nsystems  in  subprojects  that  prioritize  water  efficiency  (e.g.,  water  loss \nminimization  through  NRW  reduction  programs)  and  water  security  (e.g., \nrestoration of riverbank reservoirs); and (b) the expansion of sanitation (through \nan output-based toilet program), sewerage networks, sewage treatment capacity \nand  effluent  reuse  infrastructure  for  subprojects  that  promote  environmental \nprotection  and  improvement  of  water  bodies  (e.g.,  preventing  discharge  of \nuntreated  sewage),  and  water  productivity  and  financial  sustainability  (e.g., \neffluent reuse for industry).    \n(ii)  Output  2:  Improved  water  resource  planning,  monitoring,  and  service \ndelivery.  Output  2  will  finance  the  following  nonphysical  investments: \n                                                \n6  The  plan  calls  for  a  paradigm  shift  in  water  resource  management,  which  in  the  urban  context  involves \n(i) integrated urban water supply and sewerage systems; (ii) targets for recycling of water by industry; (iii) improved \nwater data collection and management systems; (iv) demand management and planning at a regional scale. \n7  The investment program is scheduled for ADB approval in 2014. \n8  ADB. 2013.

Project 1 is representative of subprojects to be financed under the investment program. \nUnder output 1, project 1  will finance UWSS infrastructure in three towns of the Tungabhadra \nsubbasin: Byadagi, Davangere, and Harihar, including (i) increased water treatment capacity \n(15,000 cubic meters per day) and improvements to water supply networks (1,065 km) to \nensure comprehensive, efficient and continuous water supply; and (ii) increased wastewater \ntreatment capacity (4 new sewage treatment plants with a total capacity of 48,000 cubic meters \nper day) and improvements to the sewerage networks (365 km of pipeline and 5,000 pro-poor \ntoilets) to promote environmental protection. Output 2 will support reform implementation and \nwill finance (i) a fraction of the ULB incentive fund, and services to (ii) draft the public standpost \nguidelines, (iii) prepare selected IT-based modules and pilot them in three selected towns, (iv) \nassist mainstreaming private sector participation through performance-based contracts in water \nschemes, and (v) develop and deliver a communication and awareness campaign. Under output \n3, it will finance consultancies for project management and design and supervision, as well as \ncapacity development activities to strengthen KUIDFC\u2019s financial intermediary mandate and \nULBs\u2019 administrative functions (through training of over 75 officials). Subsequent projects will \nprovide infrastructure in other towns in the state and nonphysical assistance to complete the \nintended  program  outputs.12 Towns  will  be  selected  based  on  (i)  the  impact  of  IWRM \nimprovements  on  Karnataka\u2019s  water  resources,  (ii)  ULBs\u2019  reform  willingness,  and  (iii)  the \ninfrastructure gap.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The investment program is estimated to cost $227.0 million (Table 1). The Government \nof India has requested an MFF in an amount up to $152.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and other resources to help finance a part of the investment program. \nThe MFF will consist of up to three tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related \nperiodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for each \ntranche, and fulfillment of the terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement. 13  \n \n16.  Project 1 will be funded from the first tranche of the MFF ($75.0 million) which will have a \n25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n19.  The investment program has been conceptualized to address water security problems \naccentuated  by  climate  change  and  designed  to  incorporate  IWRM  benefits.17 Technical \npriorities outlined in the framework financing agreement are consistent with this approach. All \nthree towns in project 1 are in close proximity (within the Upper Tungabhadra subbasin) and \ndraw drinking water from the same polluted river section. Achieving full sewerage coverage and \nconnecting  all  households  are  expected  to  result  in  important  river  quality  improvements. \nEffluent reuse is possible for agricultural purposes in the three towns, and reuse by small \nindustry is being evaluated in Davangere. All towns have significant levels of NRW, which may \nincrease  after  continuous  water  is  supplied.  As  water  loss  management  is  essential, \nperformance-based management contracts for water will be utilized in the project towns after \nestablishing baselines and targets for NRW reduction.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for government intervention is sound as \nthe investment program supports the improved provision of basic civic services, a public good \nprovided by the government. As a result of improved public services, positive externalities in \npublic health, human capital development, environment protection, and resource management \nwill be created and better managed. The economic analysis evaluated the economic viability of \nthe six water supply and sewerage subprojects under project 1. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of 12.9%\u201323.6% for the six subprojects is higher than the economic opportunity \ncost of capital at 12%, indicating sufficient economic benefits. The results are robust against \ndownside risks, including (i) capital cost overrun by 10%, (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncost overrun by 10%, (iii) benefits reduced by 10%, and (iv) delay in project implementation by 1 \n                                                \n17  Climate Change Risk Screening (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nyear. The EIRRs range from 10.7% to 19.8% in the sensitivity analysis; the minimum EIRR is \n10.7%  when  all  risks  are  assumed  to  occur  at  the  same  time,  which  is  improbable.  The \nsensitivity analysis shows that EIRRs are relatively more sensitive to a reduction in benefits. \nGiven Karnataka\u2019s rapidly increasing urbanization rates (to over 50% by 2030), the risk for \nunrealized economic benefits from project 1 is minimal. \n \n21.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 0.9%\u20132.9% for the \nthree  water  subprojects  exceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  0.68%, \nindicating reasonable financial return. This is based on the assumptions that volumetric water \ntariffs  will  be  set  and  adjusted  over  time  to  recover  O&M  costs  and  capital  investments. \nPotential revenue streams from the water supply subprojects can be utilized to subsidize the \nO&M costs of the sewerage subprojects at the ULB level. Though FIRRs for sewerage do not \nmeet the hurdle rate, the towns will fully recover the O&M costs from incremental revenues over \nthe analysis period.18 In the initial 5-year period, other municipal resources will be required to \nsupport O&M for the combined subprojects in case of one ULB (Byadagi). Sensitivity analyses \nrevealed that the water supply subprojects' FIRRs are most sensitive to a reduction in revenues, \nindicating that improved collection efficiency and implementation of volumetric tariffs will be \ncrucial to ensuring financial viability. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Karnataka  and  project  1  towns  offer  opportunities  to  test  new  approaches  to  reform, \ncontractual models fostering shared responsibility and accountability within the public sector, and \npublic\u2013private partnerships. Institutional arrangements proposed under the investment program are \nconsistent with state and ULB mandates. The KUIDFC\u2019s procurement and project management \ncapacity is appropriate. The financial management assessment did not identify any significant \nconcerns.  To  ensure  proper  recording  and  management  of  account  transactions,  designated \naccounting and finance staff for the investment program should be engaged at the right time, \nespecially at the project implementing unit level. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nfrom time to time) was explained to and discussed with the central and state governments and \nKUIDFC. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility \nadministration manual. Anticorruption and governance measures under the North Karnataka Urban \nSector Investment Program remain appropriate and will be extended to this investment program.19  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The  investment  program  will  implement  socially  inclusive  and  gender-focused \ninterventions.20 Under project 1, data, disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and social and economic \nbackground will be collected at regular intervals to help establish baseline figures to track social \nand gender equality results as the project progresses. A gender action plan has been prepared \nfor project 1 to ensure that social and gender equality activities are implemented and monitored \nat regular intervals. The project will target poor, disadvantaged, and female-headed households \nthrough improved water supply, sewerage, and sanitation, as well as implementation of existing \n                                                \n18  A 10-year forecast based on ULBs\u2019 past 4-year financial performance showed that incremental O&M costs arising \nfrom water and sewerage subprojects could be absorbed in their budget without creating any major fiscal burden. \n19  Measures include (i) public disclosure on the KUIDFC\u2019s project webpage of physical and financial progress, and \nresults of tenders; (ii) public disclosure of annual project accounts audits; and (iii) ULB web-based platforms to \npromptly redress public grievances (ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Loan to India for the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program. Manila).  \n20  Key initiatives include (i) new or improved water and sewerage connections for poor, socially disadvantaged, and \nfemale-headed households; (ii) a communication program to bring about attitudinal changes to health, hygiene, \nand sanitation; (iii) capacity development to sensitize government staff on social inclusion and gender; (iv) \nparticipation from disadvantaged groups in project implementation, and monitoring activities; (v) awareness raising. \n ", "9 \ngovernment policies that ensure affordability of water user rates and installation of household \ntoilets in accordance with the \u201cBharat Nirman Abhiyan\u201d total sanitation scheme. Information and \ncommunication materials will be developed to educate communities on social, economic, and \nhealth-related impacts of improved hygiene and sanitation conditions. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  Resettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Temporary \nimpacts on loss of income to shop owners, street vendors, and hawkers are envisaged due to \nconstruction and rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage networks in project towns. A total \nof 9.09 hectares of private agricultural land will need to be acquired for the construction of \nsewage treatment plants in Byadagi and Davengere, impacting 12 landowners. The new service \nreservoirs, sewage treatment plants, lift stations, and community toilets will be located within \nexisting facilities or in government and/or community lands. One voluntary land donation for a \nsewage lift station in Harihar has been identified. Independent third party validation of the \ndonated land was done and the report is included in the final Harihar resettlement plan. The \ndraft resettlement plans of Byadagi and Davengere were prepared in consultation with affected \npersons during the preparation stage in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The final resettlement plans will be prepared upon the completion of detailed design and \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval prior to implementation. The Indian Right to Fair \nCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act is in \neffect since 1 January 2014. Based on socioeconomic surveys, no indigenous people reside in \nproject sites. Improved water supply and sewerage networks will benefit all households equally. \nMeaningful  and  widespread  consultations  with  communities  will  continue  throughout \nimplementation. Resettlement and indigenous peoples\u2019 frameworks have been prepared and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s webpage. They provide guidance and outline requirements to prepare \nmitigation plans for involuntary resettlement and/or indigenous people impacts for project 1 and \nprojects under future tranches of the investment program.21  \n \n25.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared  to  guide  the  preparation  of  future  tranches,  and  three  initial  environmental \nexaminations with environmental management plans were prepared for project 1 in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  laws.  The  initial  environmental \nexaminations conclude that no significant adverse impact is anticipated as a result of UWSS \ninfrastructure  expansion  and  rehabilitation  works  proposed  in  the  project  1  towns.  It  is \nenvisaged that the net environmental benefits to the population of the three towns will be \npositive and significant as a result of improved (i) water efficiency and security through the \nimplementation of NRW reduction programs; and (ii) river water quality through the expansion of \nsewerage  networks,  treatment  capacity,  and  sanitation  coverage.  The  initial  environmental \nexaminations outline a grievance redress mechanism to ensure easy and quick redress of any \ncomplaints or concerns during project implementation. The environmental management plans \nprovide adequate mitigation measures to address temporary construction impacts, including \ntraffic management, to ensure limited disruption to traffic flow and access.22  \n \n                                                \n21  The resettlement plans outline objectives, policies, principles, procedures for resettlement and compensation, and \nassistance to affected persons. They will be updated upon completion of the engineering designs. The KUIDFC has \nadequate capacity for preparing and implementing social safeguard measures. An updated resettlement framework and \nHarihar resettlement plan were endorsed by the KUIDFC and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in February 2014. \n22 Construction impacts also include  adequate gravel, sand, and aggregate sourcing; dust and noise generation; and \nconstruction waste runoff. Environmental management plans will be included in all bid documents, and the KUIDFC \nwill monitor their implementation and submit periodic progress reports on environment safeguards to ADB.  \n ", "10 \nF.
